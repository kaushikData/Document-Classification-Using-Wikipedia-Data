'''Brithenig''' is an invented language, or [[constructed language]] ("conlang"). It was created as a hobby in 1996 by Andrew Smith from [[New Zealand]], who also invented the [[alternate history]] of [[Ill Bethisad]] to "explain" it.

Brithenig was not developed to be used in the real world, like [[Esperanto]] or [[Interlingua]], nor to provide detail to a work of fiction, like [[Klingon language|Klingon]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' scenarios. Rather, Brithenig started as a thought experiment to create a [[Romance languages|Romance]] language that might have evolved if [[Latin]] had displaced the native [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] language as the spoken language of the people in [[Great Britain]].

The result is an artificial sister language to [[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] which differs from them by having sound-changes similar to those that affected the [[Welsh language]], and words that are borrowed from the [[Brittonic languages]] and from [[English language|English]] throughout its pseudo-history. One important distinction between Brithenig and Welsh is that while Welsh is [[Gallo-Brittonic languages|P-Celtic]], Latin was a [[Osco-Umbrian_languages#Differences_from_Latin|Q-Italic language]] (as opposed to [[Osco-Umbrian_languages#Differences_from_Latin|P-Italic]], like [[Oscan language|Oscan]]), and this trait was passed onto Brithenig.

Similar efforts to extrapolate Romance languages are ''Breathanach'' (influenced by the other branch of Celtic), ''Judajca'' (influenced by Hebrew), ''Þrjótrunn'' (a non-Ill Bethisad language influenced by Icelandic), ''[[Wenedyk]]'' (influenced by Polish), and ''Xliponian'' (which experienced a [[Grimm's law]]-like sound shift). It has also inspired ''Wessisc'', a hypothetical Germanic language influenced by contact with Old Celtic.

Brithenig was granted the code BZT as part of [[ISO 639:b#bzt|ISO 639-3]].

Andrew Smith was one of the conlangers featured in the exhibit "Esperanto, Elvish, and Beyond: The World of Constructed Languages" displayed at the [[Cleveland Public Library]] from May through August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/26418663@N05/2478687117/ |title=Esperanto, Elvish, and Beyond |website=[[Flickr]] |access-date=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's creation of Brithenig was cited as the reason for his inclusion in the exhibit (which also included the Babel Text&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.langmaker.com/babelintro.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514232430/http://www.langmaker.com/babelintro.htm |title=Babel Text Introduction |archive-date=2011-05-14 |website=Langmarker |access-date=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Smith's language).

==Vocabulary==
Most of Brithenig's vocabulary is distinctively Romance, even though it is disguised as Welsh. The following list of 30 words gives an impression of what Brithenig looks like in comparison to nine other Romance languages including Wenedyk, and to Welsh. The similarity of about one-quarter of the Welsh words to Brithenig words (indicated by not being bracketed) is due to their common [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] background, although a few others, such as ''ysgol'', were borrowings from Latin into Welsh.

[[File:Crossing the T (naval movement) animated anigif.gif|thumb|200px|right|Blue crosses Red's ''T'', animation]]

'''Crossing the ''T''''' or '''capping the ''T''''' is a classic [[naval warfare]] tactic used from the late 19th to mid 20th centuries, in which a line of [[warship]]s crosses in front of a line of enemy ships, allowing the crossing line to bring all their guns to bear while receiving fire from only the forward guns of the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fleet tactics and coastal combat |last= Hughes|first= Wayne P. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2000|publisher= Naval Institute Press|location= |isbn=978-1-55750-392-3 |page= 74|pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It became possible to bring all of a ship's main guns to bear only in the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, with the advent of steam-powered battleships with rotating gun turrets, which were able to move faster and turn more quickly than sailing ships, which had fixed guns facing sideways. The tactic became largely obsolete with the introduction of [[missile]]s and [[aircraft]] as long-range strikes are less dependent on the direction the ships are facing.

== Tactics ==

When going into battle, ships would assume a [[battle line]] formation called "line astern", in which one vessel follows another in one or more parallel lines. This allows each ship to fire over wide arcs without lofting [[salvo]]s of [[Shell (projectile)|projectiles]] over friendly vessels. Each ship in the line generally engages its opposite number in the enemy battle line which moves in a [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] course.

However, moving ahead of the enemy line on a [[perpendicular]] course (crossing the ''T'') enables a ship to launch salvos at the same target with both the forward and rear turrets, maximizing the chances for a hit. It also makes ranging errors less critical for the ship doing the crossing, while simultaneously more critical for the ship being crossed. In military terms, this is known as "[[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] fire". The tactic, designed for heavily armed and armoured battleships, was used with varying degrees of success with more lightly armed and armoured [[cruiser]]s and [[heavy cruiser]]s.

Advances in gun manufacturing and [[fire-control system]]s allowed engagements at increasingly long range, from approximately 6,000 yards (5.5&amp;nbsp;km; 2.9&amp;nbsp;nautical miles) at the [[Battle of Tsushima]] in 1905 to 20,000 yards (18&amp;nbsp;km; 9.8&amp;nbsp;nautical miles) at the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916. The introduction of [[brown powder]], which burned less rapidly than [[black powder]], allowed longer barrels, which allow greater accuracy; and because it expands less sharply than black powder, it puts less strain on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances. The addition of [[radar]] allowed World War II-era ships to fire farther, more accurately, and at night.

== Battles ==

Notable battles in which warships crossed the ''T'' include:

* [[Battle of Tsushima]] (1905) – Japanese [[Admiral Togo]], by use of [[wireless]] communications and the proper deployment of [[reconnaissance]] had positioned his fleet in such a way as to bring the [[Russia]]n fleet to battle, "irrespective of speeds".&lt;ref&gt;Mahan p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;  Togo had preserved for himself the interior lines of movement, while forcing the longer lines of movement upon his opponent, whichever course the Russian admiral should take; and by his selected positioning had the effect of "throwing the Russian [[broadside]]s more and more out of action".&lt;ref&gt;Mahan p. 450&lt;/ref&gt;  "He had headed him"&lt;ref&gt;Mahan p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; (crossed his T). The Russian admiral, other than retreat or surrender, had no other option other than "charging Togo's battle line" or "accepting a formal [[pitched battle]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mahan p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;  Admiral [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]] chose the latter, resulting in his total defeat in the only [[Decisive victory|decisive]] fleet action in naval history fought solely by modern battleships. Rozhestvensky was severely wounded during the battle and was taken prisoner. Seven battleships were sunk, and one was captured by the Japanese.
* [[Naval Battle of Elli|Battle of Elli]] (1912) – [[Rear Admiral]] Pavlos Kountouriotis aboard the [[Greece|Greek]] cruiser [[Greek cruiser Georgios Averof|''Georgios Averof'']] at a speed of 20 knots crossed the ''T'' of the [[Turkey|Turkish]] fleet on December 13, 1912. The ''Averof'' concentrated her fire against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] flagship, forcing the Turks to retreat.
* [[Battle of Jutland]] (1916) – Admiral [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Sir John Jellicoe]], leader of the [[British Grand Fleet]], was able to cross the ''T'' twice against the German [[High Seas Fleet]], but the German fleet was both times able to escape by reversing course in poor visibility. 
* [[Battle of Cape Esperance]] (1942) – the first [[United States]] (U.S.) naval night battle victory over the Japanese when a U.S. force of cruisers and [[destroyer]]s under Admiral [[Norman Scott (admiral)|Norman Scott]] crossed the ''T'' of a cruiser–destroyer force under [[Aritomo Gotō]].  Gotō's force was approaching [[Guadalcanal]] on October 11, 1942 to bombard [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]] in support of a [[Tokyo Express]] reinforcement mission when it was surprised and defeated by Scott's force in a confused night battle. Goto died of his wounds shortly after the battle, and lost the cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Furutaka||2}} along with three destroyers.
* [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October 1944)|Battle of Surigao Strait]] (1944) – the most recent time a battle line crossed the ''T'', this engagement took place during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], in the [[Philippines]] during [[World War II]].  Early on October 25, 1944, Rear Admiral [[Jesse B. Oldendorf]] was guarding the southern entrance to the [[Leyte Gulf]] at the northern end of [[Surigao Strait]].  He commanded a line of six battleships ([[USS West Virginia (BB-48)|''West Virginia'']], [[USS Tennessee (BB-43)|''Tennessee'']], [[USS California (BB-44)|''California'']], [[USS Maryland (BB-46)|''Maryland'']], [[USS Pennsylvania (BB-38)|''Pennsylvania'']], and {{USS|Mississippi|BB-41|2}}), flanked by numerous heavy and light cruisers.  A smaller [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese]] force under [[Vice Admiral]] [[Shoji Nishimura]] came up the strait, aware of the formidable strength of the American force but nonetheless pressing on. Half of Nishimura's fleet was eliminated by the Americans' destroyer torpedoes, but the Japanese admiral continued on with his remaining few ships. Oldendorf's battleships were arrayed in a line, and they unleashed their radar-directed fire-power upon Japanese vessels, whose return fire was ineffectual due to the lack of radar fire control and earlier battle damage. Nishimura went down with his ship. Despite this, however, {{ship|Japanese battleship|Yamashiro||2}}'s guns, along with cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Mogami|1934|2}} managed to severely damage an American destroyer. This was the last time the ''T'' was crossed in an engagement between battleships, and the last occasion on which battleships fought each other.

[[File:Buddha dharma magazine cover 1929.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of ''Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa'' ("Buddhism and Nepalese") magazine dated August 1929.]]
'''Dharmaditya Dharmacharya''' ([[Devanagari]]: धर्मादित्य धर्माचार्य) (born '''Jagat Man Vaidya''') (1902–1963) was a Nepalese author, Buddhist scholar and language activist. He worked to develop [[Nepal Bhasa]] and revive [[Theravada Buddhism]] when Nepal was ruled by the [[Rana dynasty]] and both were dangerous activities, and was consequently jailed.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Harischandra Lal (1996).

Dharmacharya campaigned for [[Nepal Era]] as the national calendar. He also wrote and published the first magazine in Nepal Bhasa and was a major influence in the [[Nepal Bhasa renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murti|first=Ven.

''Who's Who in Nepal Bhasha.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. Page 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his service to the language, he has also been called the "fifth pillar" of Nepal Bhasa along with the [[Four Pillars of Nepal Bhasa]].

==Early life==

Dharmacharya was born at [[Chyasal|Chikan Bahi]], [[Lalitpur District, Nepal|Lalitpur District]] to father Vaidya Vrishman Vandya and mother Muni Thakun Vandya. He studied at [[Durbar High School]] in [[Kathmandu]] and did his matriculation from [[Kolkata]] and enrolled at the [[University of Calcutta]] for higher studies.

==Buddhist activist==

On his visits to Kathmandu during the holidays, he organized Buddhist programs and exhibitions of religious pictures he had collected in Kolkata. In 1924, he established the Buddha Dharma Support Association at the home of [[Dharma Man Tuladhar]]. He encouraged its members to read Buddhist books and translated articles in English and [[Pali]] into Nepal Bhasa.

Upon his return to Kolkata, he established the Nepalese Buddhist Association to help Nepalese traders who had fallen into difficulty besides teaching them Buddhist principles. In 1928, he helped organize the All India Buddhist Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From Editorial Desk|url=http://www.niem.com.np/buddhisthim/backissues/vol9_no12/editorial10.htm|accessdate=7 February 2012|newspaper=Buddhist Himalaya: A Journal of Nagarjuna Institute of Exact Methods|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to promote Buddhism among the Nepalese in [[Darjeeling]], he brought out ''Himalaya Bauddha'' in the [[Nepali language]] and ''Buddhist India'' in English in 1927 which he and B. M. Barua ([[Benimadhab Barua]]) edited.&lt;ref&gt;Hridaya, Chittadhar (1982, third ed.) ''Jheegu Sahitya'' ("Our Literature"). Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parisad. Page 172.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Jahar and Indian Institute of Advanced Study (1992). ''India and Nepal: Some aspects of culture contact.'' Indian Institute of Advanced Study. {{ISBN|81-85182-69-8}}, {{ISBN|978-81-85182-69-8}}. Page 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language activist==

Dharmacharya was a cultural nationalist and dedicated himself to promoting Nepal Bhasa and obtaining international recognition for it.&lt;ref&gt;Lecomte-Tilouine, Marie and Dollfus, Pascale (2003) ''Ethnic Revival and Religious Turmoil: Identities and Representations in the Himalayas.'' Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-565592-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-565592-6}}. Page 100. Retrieved 3 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, he published ''[[Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa]]'' (बुद्ध धर्म व नॆपाल भाषा "Buddhism and Nepalese") from Kolkata, India. It was the first ever magazine to be published in Nepal Bhasa.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005) ''Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal.'' Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-01908-9}}. Pages 27–28. Retrieved 2 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It contained articles on Buddhism and also provided writers in Nepal a place to publish their compositions which they couldn't do at home because of the government's dislike of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). ''Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns.'' New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. {{ISBN|81-208-0963-7}}. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to support the emerging Nepal Bhasa movement in Nepal and promote the language at home and abroad, he established the first Nepal Bhasa literary organization Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Mandal ("Nepal Bhasa Literature Organization") in Kolkata in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Bal Gopal|title=The Newars: The Indigenous Population of the Kathmandu Valley in the Modern State of Nepal)|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_26_01_04.pdf|accessdate=23 March 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1999}} Page 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dharmacharya returned to Kathmandu with a Master's degree in Pali. He joined the Industry Council as an administrative officer and got married to Asta Maya and settled down into the life of a householder.

==Imprisonment==

In 1940, Dharmacharya was arrested in a crackdown against democracy activists, writers and social reformers. He was jailed for three months with other Nepal Bhasa writers. Following the incident, he remained inactive in social work for more than five years. He spent the later part of his life lecturing and writing.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N.

==Legacy==
[[File:Dharmaditya 35x5.jpg|thumb|200px|Bust of Dharmaditya Dharmacharya at Pulchok, Lalitpur.]]
In 1956, Dharmacharya was decorated with the title of Patron of the Language by Chwasa Pasa.&lt;ref&gt;Hridaya, Chittadhar (1982, third ed.) ''Jheegu Sahitya'' ("Our Literature"). Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parisad. Page 192.&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Dharmacharya has been erected at Pulchok, Lalipur.

The [[Simple English Wikipedia]] is a variation in which most of the articles use only basic English vocabulary. There is also the [[Old English|Old English (Ænglisc/Anglo-Saxon)]] Wikipedia ([[:ang:Hēafodtramet|angwiki]]). Community-produced news publications include ''[[The Signpost]]''.&lt;ref name=AyersMatthews2008/&gt;

== Pioneering edition ==

{{See also|Wikipedia:Milestones}}

The English Wikipedia was the first Wikipedia edition and has remained the largest. It has pioneered many ideas as conventions, policies or features which were later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas include "featured articles",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_articles&amp;oldid=104207677 | title=Featured articles | author=English Wikipedia | date=30 January 2007 | accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the neutral-point-of-view policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view&amp;oldid=103033132 | title=Neutral point of view | author=English Wikipedia | date=25 January 2007 | accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; navigation templates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Help:Template&amp;oldid=520481 | title=Help:Template | author=Wikimedia Meta-Wiki | date=29 January 2007 | accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
the sorting of short "stub" articles into sub-categories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Stub_sorting&amp;oldid=101829026 | title=WikiProject Stub sorting | author=English Wikipedia | date=19 January 2007 | accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dispute resolution]] mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Resolving_disputes&amp;oldid=103577785 | title=Resolving disputes | author=English Wikipedia | date=27 January 2007 | accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and weekly collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Article_Creation_and_Improvement_Drive&amp;oldid=104243512|title=Article Creation and Improvement Drive|author=English Wikipedia|date=30 January 2007|accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English Wikipedia has adopted features from Wikipedias in other languages. These features include verified revisions from the German Wikipedia ([[:de:Wikipedia:Hauptseite|dewiki]]) and town population-lookup templates from the [[Dutch Wikipedia]] ([[:nl:Hoofdpagina|nlwiki]]).

Although the English Wikipedia stores images and audio files, as well as text files, many of the images have been moved to [[Wikimedia Commons]] with the same name, as passed-through files. However, the English Wikipedia also has [[fair-use]] images and audio/video files (with copyright restrictions), most of which are not allowed on Commons.

Many of the most active participants in the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], and the developers of the [[MediaWiki]] software that powers Wikipedia, are English users.

&lt;/center&gt;

The English Wikipedia reached 4,000,000 registered user accounts on 1 April 2007,&lt;ref name="4,564,000"&gt;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2007-04-02/News and notes]]. Retrieved 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; just a little over a year since it had crossed a threshold of 1,000,000 registered user accounts in late February 2006.&lt;ref name="1,000,000"&gt;[[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2006-02-27/News and notes]]. Retrieved 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 800,000 editors have edited Wikipedia more than 10 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm#wikipedians |title=Wikipedia Statistics – Tables – English |publisher=Stats.wikimedia.org |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 300,000 editors edit Wikipedia every month;{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} of these, over 30,000 perform more than 5 edits per month, and a little over 3,000 perform more than 100 edits per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesWikipediaEN.htm#activitylevels |title=Wikipedia Statistics – Tables – English |publisher=Stats.wikimedia.org |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 24 November 2011, a total of 500 million edits had been performed on the English Wikipedia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

As the largest Wikipedia edition, and because English is such a widely used language, the English Wikipedia draws many users and editors whose [[native language]] is not English. Such users may seek information from the English Wikipedia rather than the Wikipedia of their native language because the English Wikipedia tends to contain more information about general subjects. Successful collaborations have been developed between non-native English speakers who successfully add content to the English Wikipedia and native English speakers who act as copyeditors for them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

=== Arbitration committee ===
{{Main|Arbitration Committee}}
The English Wikipedia has an arbitration committee (also known as ArbCom) that consists of a panel of editors that imposes binding rulings with regard to disputes between other editors of the online encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="AU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/democracy-for-knowalls/2006/11/30/1164777721624.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |title=Know-alls |accessdate= 15 June 2009 |last=Schiff |first=Stacy | authorlink=Stacy Schiff |date=2 December 2006 |work=[[The Age]] |location=Australia |publisher=Fairfax Digital Network }}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee was created by [[Jimmy Wales]] on 4 December 2003 as an extension of the decision-making power he had formerly held as owner of the site.&lt;ref name="Wales1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markmail.org/message/komcldyapats43xj#query:+page:1+mid:komcldyapats43xj+state:results |title= WikiEN-l Wikiquette committee appointments |accessdate=9 June 2009 |last=Wales |first=Jimmy |date=4 December 2003 |work=Wikipedia |publisher=[[Wikimedia Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSRN"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wikitruth Through Wikiorder |journal=[[Emory Law Journal]]|year=2010|first=David A.|last=Hoffman|author2=Salil Mehra |volume=59|issue=2010|ssrn=1354424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When initially founded, the committee consisted of 12 [[arbitrators]] divided into three groups of four members each.&lt;ref name="Wales1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortune"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/31/magazines/fortune/mysql_greatteams_fortune/index.htm |title=Secrets of Greatness: Great Teams |accessdate= 15 June 2009 |last=Hyatt |first=Josh |date=1 June 2006 |work=Fortune |publisher=[[Time Warner]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the committee has gradually expanded its membership to 18 arbitrators.&lt;ref name="Wales2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jimbo_Wales&amp;oldid=259248025 |title=ArbCom Appointments |accessdate=14 June 2009 |last=Wales |first=Jimmy |date= 20 December 2008 |work=Wikipedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|reason=One of the 18 had retired|date=September 2014}}

As with other aspects of the English Wikipedia, some of Wikipedia's sister projects have emulated the arbitration committee with their own similar versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q3999572&amp;oldid=163359767#sitelinks-wikipedia|title=Wikipedia sitelinks for Arbitration Committee|author=Wikidata|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in 2007, an arbitration committee was founded on the [[German Wikipedia]] called the {{Interlanguage link multi|Schiedsgericht|de}}.&lt;ref name="dewiki-2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/Wikipedia-sucht-Schiedsrichter--/meldung/89083 |title=Wikipedia sucht Schiedsrichter |accessdate= 9 June 2009 |last=Kleinz |first=Torsten |date= 30 April 2007 |publisher=heise online |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
{{Main|Criticism of Wikipedia}}
{{See also|Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident|Essjay controversy}}

=== Threats against high schools ===
Several incidents of threats of violence against high schools on Wikipedia have been reported in the mainstream press.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/29/local/me-wikipedia29 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Molly | last=Hennessy-Fiske | title=Wikipedia threats went unchecked – Los Angeles Times | date=29 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCLocal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6087243 |title=Hacienda Heights school receives possible threat | website=abc7.com |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=18 April 2008 |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Student arrested for violent threats on Wikipedia |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2008/04/wiki.html?cid=6a00d8341c630a53ef011571abd811970b |work=Los Angeles Times |date=29 April 2008 |accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Glen A. Wilson High School]] was the subject of such a threat in 2008,&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCLocal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LATimes2" /&gt; and a 14-year-old was arrested for making a threat against [[Niles West High School]] on Wikipedia in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pantagraph.com/news/article_baef01f3-e56f-52e1-b9af-e90eb83e811b.html|title=Teen charged after threat to school on Wikipedia|date=31 October 2006|agency=Associated Press  |publisher=Pantagraph.com|accessdate=26 January 2011|location=Bloomington, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disputed articles ===
A 2013 study from [[Oxford University]] concluded that the most disputed articles on the English Wikipedia tended to be broader issues, while on other language Wikipedias the most disputed articles tended to be regional issues; this is due to the English language's status as a global ''[[lingua franca]]'', which means that many who edit the English Wikipedia [[English as a second language|do not speak English as a native language]].{{Clarify|date=March 2017}}  The study stated that the most disputed entries on the English Wikipedia were: [[George W. Bush]], [[anarchism]], [[Muhammad]], [[list of WWE personnel]], [[global warming]], [[circumcision]], [[United States]], [[Jesus]], [[race and intelligence]], and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Gross&gt;Gross, Doug. "[http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/24/tech/web/controversial-wikipedia-pages/index.html?hpt=hp_t5 Wiki wars: The 10 most controversial Wikipedia pages]." ''[[CNN]]''. 24 July 2013. Retrieved on 26 July 2013. {{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/24/tech/web/controversial-wikipedia-pages/index.html?hpt=hp_t5 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 July 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412001130/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/24/tech/web/controversial-wikipedia-pages/index.html?hpt=hp_t5 |archivedate=12 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Varieties of English ===
One controversy in the English Wikipedia concerns which [[List of dialects of the English language|national variety]] of the English language is to be preferred, with the most commonly advocated candidates being [[American English]] and [[British English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28spelling%29|title=Wikipedia:Manual of Style (spelling)|author=English Wikipedia|accessdate=25 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perennial suggestions range from standardizing upon a single form of English to [[fork (software)|forking]] the English Wikipedia project. A style guideline states, "the English Wikipedia has no general preference for a major national variety of the language" and "an article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation uses the appropriate variety of English for that nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#National_varieties_of_English|title=Wikipedia:Manual of Style|author=English Wikipedia|accessdate=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article should use spelling and grammar variants consistently; for example, ''color'' and ''colour'' are not to be used in the same article, since they represent American and British English, respectively. The guide also states that an article must remain in its original national variant.

There has been a [[Chinese Wikipedia#Automatic conversion between traditional and simplified Chinese characters|similar issue in the Chinese-language Wikipedia]] concerning regional differences in writing. Efforts toward a language fork for [[Portuguese Wikipedia]] have failed, but those regarding [[Norwegian Wikipedia]] succeeded.

[[Andrew Lih]] wrote that the English Wikipedia "didn't have the chance to go through a debate over whether there should be a British English Wikipedia or an American English Wikipedia" because the English Wikipedia was the original edition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lih|Lih]], p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=How does being the original edition prevent debate?|date=February 2015}} Editors agreed to use U.S. spellings for primarily American topics and British spellings for primarily British topics. In 2009 Lih wrote, "No doubt, American spellings tend to dominate by default just because of sheer numbers."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lih|Lih]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wikiprojects, and assessments of articles' importance and quality ==
&lt;!-- This section is transcluded into [[Wikipedia]]; please do not change this section's heading without also changing the selective transclusion markup in that article --&gt;
{{Main|WikiProject}}

A "[[WikiProject]]" is a [[social group|group]] of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve Wikipedia. These groups often focus on a specific topic area (for example, [[women's history]]), a specific location or a specific kind of task (for example, checking newly created pages). The English Wikipedia currently has over [[Wikipedia:Database reports/WikiProjects by changes|2,000 WikiProjects]] and activity varies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject | title=Wikipedia: Wikiprojects | accessdate=16 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the English Wikipedia introduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles.&lt;ref name="WP 1.0 editorial team 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team/Assessment|title=Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment|accessdate=28 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles are rated by WikiProjects. The range of quality classes begins with "Stub" (very short pages), followed by "Start", "C" and "B" (in increasing order of quality). Community peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the highest quality classes: either "[[WP:Good articles|good article]]", "A" or the highest, "[[WP:Featured articles|featured article]]". Of the about 4.4 million articles and lists assessed as of March 2015, a little more than 5,000 (0.12%) are featured articles, and fewer than 2,000 (0.04%) are featured lists. One featured article per day, as selected by editors, appears on the [[main page]] of Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="FMonday feat article patterns 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2365/2182|title=Comparing featured article groups and revision patterns correlations in Wikipedia|publisher=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]|accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IBM feat articles hidden pattern 1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/papers/hidden_order_wikipedia.pdf|author1=Fernanda B. Viégas |author2=Martin Wattenberg |author3=Matthew M. McKeon |title=The Hidden Order of Wikipedia|publisher=Visual Communication Lab, IBM Research|date=22 July 2007|format=PDF|accessdate=30 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The articles can also be rated as per "importance" as judged by a WikiProject. Currently, there are 5 importance categories: "low", "mid", "high", "top", and "???" for unclassified/uncertain level. For a particular article, different WikiProjects may assign different importance levels.

The [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team|Wikipedia Version 1.0 Editorial Team]] has developed a table (shown below) that displays data of all rated articles by quality and importance, on the English Wikipedia. ''If an article or list receives different ratings by two or more WikiProjects, then the highest rating is used in the table, pie-charts, and bar-chart''. The software regularly auto-updates the data.

Researcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via the intensive work of a few editors.&lt;ref name="Poderi Giacomo feat articles 1"&gt;Poderi, Giacomo, ''Wikipedia and the Featured Articles: How a Technological System Can Produce Best Quality Articles'', Master thesis, [[University of Maastricht]], October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study found unevenness in quality among featured articles and concluded that the community process is ineffective in assessing the quality of articles.&lt;ref name="FMonday WP quality control 1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/2721/2482|title=Evaluating quality control of Wikipedia's featured articles|first=David|last=Lindsey|journal=First Monday|volume=15|issue=4|date=5 April 2010|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Feminist Practice &amp; Poststructuralist Theory''. Oxford: Blackwell. pp. 195. {{ISBN|0631198253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; theories of [[feminist theory|feminist]] [[poststructuralism|post-structuralism]], and developed as a method of analysis by [[Judith Baxter]]&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, Judith (2003). ''Positioning Gender in Discourse'': A Feminist Methodology. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 215. {{ISBN|0-333-98635-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2003. FPDA is based on a combination of [[feminism]] and [[post-structuralism]]. While it is still evolving as a methodology, FPDA has been used by a range of international scholars of gender and language to analyse texts such as: classroom discourse (Castañeda-Peña 2008;&lt;ref&gt;Castaneda-Pena, Harold-Andres (2008). ''Gender and Language Research Methodologies''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 256-270. {{ISBN|9780230550698}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sauntson 2012&lt;ref&gt;Sauntson, Helen (2012).

''Gender and Language Research Methodologies''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 174-192. {{ISBN|9780230550698}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2010&lt;ref&gt;Kamada, Laurel (2010). ''Hybrid Identities and Adolescent Girls: Being Half in Japan''. Bristol: Multilingual Matters. pp. 258. {{ISBN|9781847692320}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and media representations of gender (Baker 2013&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Paul (2013). The Bloomsbury Companion to Discourse Analysis. London: Bloomsbury Academic. pp. 416. {{ISBN|9781441160126}}&lt;/ref&gt;). FPDA is an approach to analysing the discourse of spoken interaction principally.

The poststructualist part of FPDA views language as social practice and considers that people's identities and relationships are 'performed' through spoken interaction. FPDA analyses the ways in which speakers are 'positioned' by different and often competing 'discourses' according to [[Michel Foucault]]'s (1972: 49) definition as 'practices that systematically form the objects of which they speak'. According to this, speakers constantly move between powerful and powerless 'subject positions' as they talk and interact. FPDA is influenced by a poststructuralist rather than a [[Critical Discourse Analysis]] (CDA) perspective: that is, the method is informed by the view that no speaker is wholly a victim and powerless, nor wholly dominant and powerful. Rather, speakers are constantly shifting their subject positions according to the interplay of discourses within specific settings. The feminist part of FPDA considers gender difference to be a dominant discourse among competing discourses when analysing all types of text. According to Baxter (2003), FPDA does not have an 'emancipatory' agenda for women but a 'transformative' one. This means that it aims to represent women's voices that have been 'silenced' or marginalised since FPDA considers that these have been historically absent in many cultures. For example, Kamada (2008a; 2008b and 2010) uses FPDA to show how a friendship group of half-Japanese girls, who are seen by their culture as 'less than whole', draw upon competing discourses to negotiate more positive versions of their 'hybrid' ethnic and gender identities.
{{Feminism sidebar}}
==Background==
The above definition of FPDA developed from the ideas of the formalist, Mikhail Bakhtin (1981)] and the poststructuralist thinkers [[Jacques Derrida]] (1987)] and Michel Foucault (1972) in relation to power, knowledge and discourses. It is also based on the feminist work of Victorial Bergvall (1998)], Judith Butler (1990) [[Bronwyn Davies]] (1997), Valerie Walkerdine (1990)] and especially Chris Weedon (1997). Adopters of FPDA include Judith Baxter in the analysis of classroom talk and business meeting interactions; Laurel Kamada (2008; 2008; 2010) in the analysis of 'hybrid' identities of half-Japanese girls, Harold Castañeda-Peña (2008) in the examination of pupils in an EFL classroom in Brazil; Helen Sauntson in the analysis of UK secondary school classroom talk; and Paul Baker(2013) in the study of newspaper representations of predatory women. FPDA is based on the following principles, which continue to be discussed and debated by scholars:

* Discourse as social practice (rather than, or additional to, ‘language above the sentence’ or as ‘language in use’ (Cameron, 2001)
* The performative (rather than the essentialist or possessive) nature of speakers’ identities; gender is something people enact or do, not something they are or characterise (Butler 1990)
* The diversity and multiplicity of speakers’ identities: thus, gender is just one of many cultural variables constructing speakers’ identities (e.g. regional background, ethnicity, class, age), though it is still viewed as potentially highly significant
* The construction of meaning within localised or context-specific settings or communities of practice such as classrooms, board meetings, TV talk shows
* An interest in deconstruction: working out how binary power relations (e.g. males/females, public/private, objective/subjective) constitute identities, subject positions and interactions within discourses and texts, and challenging such binaries
* Inter-discursivity: recognising ways in which one discourse is always inscribed and inflected with traces of other discourses, or how one text is interwoven with another
* The need for continuous self-reflexivity: being continuously explicit and questioning about the values and assumptions made by discourse analysis.

== Definitions and statement of the conjecture ==

Every smooth surface {{math|''M''}} or curve in [[Euclidean space]] is a [[metric space]], in which the [[Riemannian manifold#Riemannian manifolds as metric spaces|(intrinsic) distance]] {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y'')}} between two points {{math|''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''}} of {{math|''M''}} is defined as the infimum of the lengths of the curves that go from {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''y''}} ''along'' {{math|''M''}}. For example, on a closed curve &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; of length {{math|2''L''}}, for each point {{math|''x''}} of the curve there is a unique other point of the curve (called the '''antipodal''' of {{math|''x''}}) at distance {{math|''L''}} from {{math|''x''}}.

A [[compact space|compact]] surface {{math|''M''}} '''fills''' a closed curve {{math|C}} if its border (also called [[Manifold#Manifold with boundary|boundary]], denoted {{math|∂''M''}}) is the curve {{math|C}}. The filling {{math|''M''}} is said '''isometric''' if for any two points {{math|''x'',''y''}} of the boundary curve {{math|''C''}}, the distance {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y'')}} between them along {{math|''M''}} is the same (not less) than the distance {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y'')}} along the boundary. In other words, to fill a curve isometrically is to fill it without introducing shortcuts.

'''Question:''' ''How small can be the area of a surface that isometrically fills its boundary curve, of given length?''

For example, in three-dimensional Euclidean space, the circle

:&lt;math&gt; C = \{(x,y,0):\ x^2+y^2=1\} &lt;/math&gt;

(of length 2{{pi}}) is filled by the flat disk

:&lt;math&gt; D = \{(x,y,0):\ x^2+y^2\leq 1\} &lt;/math&gt;

which is not an isometric filling, because any straight chord along it is a shortcut. In contrast, the hemisphere

:&lt;math&gt; H = \{(x,y,z):\ x^2+y^2+z^2=1\text{ and }z\geq 0\}&lt;/math&gt;

is an isometric filling of the same circle {{math|''C''}}, which has [[On the Sphere and Cylinder|twice the area of the flat disk]]. Is this the minimum possible area?

The surface can be imagined as made of a flexible but non-stretchable material, that allows it to be moved around and bended in Euclidean space. None of these transformations modifies the area of the surface nor the length of the curves drawn on it, which are the magnitudes relevant to the problem. The surface can be removed from Euclidean space altogether, obtaining a [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian surface]], which is an abstract [[differentiable manifold|smooth surface]] with a [[Riemannian metric]] that encodes the lengths and area. Reciprocally, according to the [[Nash-Kuiper theorem]], any Riemannian surface with boundary can be embedded in Euclidean space preserving the lengths and area specified by the Riemannian metric. Thus the filling problem can be stated equivalently as a question about [[differential geometry of surfaces|Riemannian surfaces]], that are not placed in Euclidean space in any particular way.

:'''Conjecture''' (Gromov's filling area conjecture, 1983): ''The hemisphere has minimum area among the [[orientable]] compact Riemannian surfaces that fill isometrically their boundary curve, of given length.''&lt;ref name=gromov1983filling&gt;{{cite journal| last = Gromov | first = Mikhail | year = 1983 | title = Filling Riemannian Manifolds | journal = J. Diff. Geom. | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages  = 1–147 | doi = 10.4310/jdg/1214509283 | mr=0697984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 13}}

== Gromov's proof for the case of Riemannian disks ==

In the same paper where Gromov stated the conjecture, he proved that

:''the hemisphere has least area among the Riemannian surfaces that isometrically fill a circle of given length, and are [[homeomorphic]] to a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]].''&lt;ref name=gromov1983filling/&gt;

'''Proof:''' Let &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; be a Riemannian disk that isometrically fills its boundary of length &lt;math&gt; 2L &lt;/math&gt;. Glue each point &lt;math&gt; x\in \partial M&lt;/math&gt; with its antipodal point &lt;math&gt; -x &lt;/math&gt;, defined as the unique point of &lt;math&gt; \partial M &lt;/math&gt; that is at the maximum possible distance &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt;. Gluing in this way we obtain a closed Riemannian surface &lt;math&gt; M' &lt;/math&gt; that is homeomorphic to the [[real projective plane]] and whose [[Systolic geometry#The notion of systole|systole]] (the length of the shortest non-contractible curve) is equal to &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt;. (And reciprocally, if we cut open a projective plane along a shortest noncontractible loop of length &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt;, we obtain a disk that fills isometrically its boundary of length &lt;math&gt; 2L &lt;/math&gt;.) Thus the minimum area that the isometric filling &lt;math&gt; M &lt;/math&gt; can have is equal to the minimum area that a Riemannian projective plane of systole &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; can have. But then [[Pu's inequality|Pu's systolic inequality]] asserts precisely that a Riemannian projective plane of given systole has minimum area if and only if it is round (that is, obtained from a Euclidean sphere by identifying each point with its opposite). The area of this round projective plane equals the area of the hemisphere (because each of them has half the area of the sphere).

The proof of Pu's inequality relies, in turn, on the [[uniformization theorem]].

== Fillings with Finsler metrics ==

In 2001, Sergei Ivanov presented another way to prove that the hemisphere has smallest area among isometric fillings homeomorphic to a disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= On two-dimensional minimal fillings |  language = Russian | first = Sergei V. | last = Ivanov | journal = Algebra i Analiz | volume = 13 | number = 1 | pages = 26–38 | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= On two-dimensional minimal fillings | language = english | first = Sergei V. | last = Ivanov | journal = St. Petersburg Math. J. | volume = 13 | number = 1 | year = 2002 | pages = 17–25 | mr = 1819361 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title = Filling minimality of Finslerian 2-discs | first = Sergei V. | last = Ivanov | journal = Proc. Steklov Inst. Math. | volume = 273 | number = 1 | pages = 176–190 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1134/S0081543811040079 | arxiv = 0910.2257 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His argument does not employ the [[uniformization theorem]] and is based instead on the topological fact that two curves on a disk must cross if their four endpoints are on the boundary and interlaced. Moreover, Ivanov's proof applies more generally to disks with [[Finsler manifold|Finsler metrics]], which differ from Riemannian metrics in that they need not satisfy the [[Pythagorean equation]] at the infinitesimal level. The area of a Finsler surface can be defined in various inequivalent ways, and the one employed here is the [[Holmes–Thompson volume|Holmes–Thompson area]], which coincides with the usual area when the metric is Riemannian. What Ivanov proved is that

:''The hemisphere has minimum Holmes–Thompson area among Finsler disks that isometrically fill a closed curve of given length.''

{{collapse top| title = Proof of Ivanov's theorem}}
Let {{math|(''M'',''F'')}} be a Finsler disk that isometrically fills its boundary of length {{math|2''L''}}. We may assume that {{math|''M''}} is the standard round disk in {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and the [[Finsler manifold#Definition|Finsler metric]] {{math|''F'':T''M'' {{=}} M × ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; → [0,+∞)}}  is smooth and strongly convex.&lt;ref&gt;If the original metric is not smooth and strongly convex, then we approximate it by one that enjoys these properties.&lt;/ref&gt; The Holmes–Thompson area of the filling [[Holmes–Thompson volume#Symplectic (coordinate-free) definition|can be computed by the formula]]

: &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Area}_{\mathrm{HT}}(M,F) = \frac{1}{\pi} \iint_M |B^*_x| \,\mathrm dx_0 \,\mathrm dx_1 &lt;/math&gt;

where for each point &lt;math&gt; x\in M &lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt; B^*_x \subseteq \mathbb R^2 &lt;/math&gt; is the dual unit ball of the norm &lt;math&gt; F_x &lt;/math&gt; (the unit ball of the [[dual norm]] &lt;math&gt; F_x^* &lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt; |B_x^*| &lt;/math&gt; is its usual area as a subset of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb R^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Choose a collection &lt;math&gt; P = (p_i)_{0\leq i&lt;n} \subseteq \partial M &lt;/math&gt; of boundary points, listed in counterclockwise order. For each point &lt;math&gt; p_i &lt;/math&gt;, we define on ''M'' the scalar function &lt;math&gt; f_i(x)=\mathrm{dist}_F(p_i,x)&lt;/math&gt;. These functions have the following properties:
* Each function &lt;math&gt; f_i:M\to\mathbb R &lt;/math&gt; is Lipschitz on ''M'' and therefore (by [[Rademacher's theorem]]) differentiable at [[almost every]] point &lt;math&gt; x\in M &lt;/math&gt;.
* If &lt;math&gt; f_i &lt;/math&gt; is differentiable at an interior point &lt;math&gt; x\in M^\circ &lt;/math&gt;, then there is a unique shortest curve from &lt;math&gt; p_i &lt;/math&gt; to ''x'' (parametrized with unit speed), that arrives  at ''x'' with a speed &lt;math&gt; v_i &lt;/math&gt;. The differential &lt;math&gt; \mathrm d_xf_i&lt;/math&gt; has norm 1 and is the unique covector &lt;math&gt; \varphi\in B_x^* &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \varphi(v_i)=F_x(v_i) &lt;/math&gt;.
* In each point &lt;math&gt; x\in M^\circ &lt;/math&gt; where all the functions &lt;math&gt; f_i &lt;/math&gt; are differentiable, the covectors &lt;math&gt; \mathrm d f_i &lt;/math&gt; are distinct and placed in counterclockwise order on the dual unit sphere &lt;math&gt; \partial B_x^* &lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, they must be distinct because different geodesics cannot arrive at &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; with the same speed. Also, if three of these covectors &lt;math&gt; \mathrm d_xf_i, \mathrm d_xf_j,\mathrm d_xf_k  &lt;/math&gt; (for some &lt;math&gt; 0\leq i&lt;j&lt;k&lt;n &lt;/math&gt;) appeared in inverted order, then two of the three shortest curves from the points &lt;math&gt; p_i, p_j, p_k \in\partial M &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; would cross each other, which is not possible.

In summary, for almost every interior point &lt;math&gt; x\in M^\circ &lt;/math&gt;, the covectors &lt;math&gt; \mathrm d_xf_i &lt;/math&gt; are vertices, listed in counterclockwise order, of a convex polygon inscribed in the dual unit ball &lt;math&gt; B_x^* &lt;/math&gt;. The area of this polygon is &lt;math&gt; \sum_i \frac 12 \mathrm d_xf_i\wedge\mathrm d_xf_{i+1} &lt;/math&gt; (where the index ''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is computed modulo ''n''). Therefore we have a lower bound

::&lt;math&gt; c_P:=\int_M \sum_i \frac 12 \mathrm df_i\wedge\mathrm df_{i+1} \leq \pi\, \operatorname{Area}_{\mathrm{HT}}(M,F), &lt;/math&gt;

for the area of the filling. If we define the 1-form &lt;math&gt; \theta_P = \sum_i \frac 12 f_i\,\mathrm df_{i+1} &lt;/math&gt;, then we can rewrite this lower bound using the [[Stokes' theorem|Stokes formula]] as

::&lt;math&gt; c_P = \int_M \mathrm d\theta_P = \int_{\partial M} \theta_P = \dots = 2L^2 - \sum_i \delta_i^2\ \xrightarrow{P\ \text{dense}}\ 2L^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

The boundary integral that appears here is defined in terms of the distance functions &lt;math&gt; f_i &lt;/math&gt; restricted to the boundary, which ''do not depend on the isometric filling''. The result of the integral therefore depends only on the placement of the points &lt;math&gt; p_i &lt;/math&gt; on the circle of length ''2L''. We omitted the computation, and expressed the result in terms of the lengths &lt;math&gt; \delta_i &lt;/math&gt; of each counterclockwise boundary arc from a point &lt;math&gt; p_i &lt;/math&gt; to the following point &lt;math&gt; p_{i+1} &lt;/math&gt;. The computation is valid only if &lt;math&gt; \delta_i &lt; \frac L 2 &lt;/math&gt;.

In summary, our lower bound for the area of the Finsler isometric filling converges to &lt;math&gt; \frac 1\pi 2L^2 &lt;/math&gt; as the collection &lt;math&gt; P\subseteq \partial M &lt;/math&gt; is densified. This implies that

::&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Area}_{\mathrm{HT}}(M,F) \geq \frac 1\pi\,2L^2 = \operatorname{Area}(\text{hemisphere})&lt;/math&gt;,

as we had to prove.

&lt;!-- he formula &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Area}_{\mathrm{HT}}(M,F)\simeq \int_M \mathrm d\theta_P &lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as a finite-sum approximation of [[Holmes–Thompson volume#Santaló's formula|Santalo’s formula]] for computing the area of a Riemannian (or Finslerian) disk with no conjugate points in terms of boundary distances. [cite Ivanov for this] --&gt;

{{collapse bottom}}

Unlike the Riemannian case, there is a great variety of Finsler disks that isometrically fill a closed curve and have the same Holmes–Thompson area as the hemisphere. If the [[Hausdorff measure|Hausdorff area]] is used instead, then the minimality of the hemisphere still holds, but the hemisphere becomes the unique minimizer. This follows from Ivanov's theorem since [[Holmes–Thompson volume|Normalization and comparison with Euclidean and Hausdorff measure|the Hausdorff area of a Finsler manifold is never less than the Holmes–Thompson area]], and the two areas are equal if and only if the metric is Riemannian.

=== Non-minimality of the hemisphere among rational fillings with Finsler metrics ===
A Euclidean disk that fills a circle can be replaced, without decreasing the distances between boundary points, by a Finsler disk that fills the same circle {{math|''N''}}=10 times (in the sense that its boundary wraps around the circle {{math|''N''}} times), but whose Holmes–Thompson area is less than {{math|''N''}} times the area of the disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = On Asymptotic Volume of Finsler Tori, Minimal Surfaces in Normed Spaces, and Symplectic Filling Volume | doi = 10.2307/3597285 | first = Dmitri | last = Burago | first2 = Sergei V. | last2 = Ivanov | journal = Ann. of Math. |series =  2 | volume = 156 | number = 3 | year = 2002 | pages = 891–914 | mr = 1954238}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the hemisphere, a similar replacement can be found. In other words, the filling area conjecture is false if Finsler 2-[[chain (algebraic topology)|chains]] with ''rational coefficients'' are allowed as fillings, instead of orientable surfaces (which are equivalent to 2-chains with ''integer coefficients'').

== Riemannian fillings of genus one and hyperellipticity ==

An orientable Riemannian surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] one that isometrically fills the circle cannot have less area than the hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | first = Victor | last = Bangert | first2 = Christopher B. | last2 = Croke | first3 = Sergei | last3 = Ivanov | first4 = Mikhail G. | last4 = Katz | title = Filling area conjecture and ovalless real hyperelliptic surfaces | journal = Geom.

The non-orientable closed surface obtained in this way has an [[Orientability#Orientable double cover|orientable double cover]] of genus two, and is therefore [[hyperelliptic curve|hyperelliptic]]. The proof then exploits a formula by J.&amp;nbsp;Hersch from integral geometry. Namely, consider the family of figure-8 loops on a football, with the self-intersection point at the equator. Hersch's formula expresses the area of a metric in the conformal class of the football, as an average of the energies of the figure-8 loops from the family.  An application of Hersch's formula to the hyperelliptic quotient of the Riemann surface proves the filling area conjecture in this case.

== Almost flat manifolds are minimal fillings of their boundary distances ==

If a Riemannian manifold {{math|''M''}} (of any dimension) is '''almost flat''' (more precisely, {{math|''M''}} is a region of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb R^n &lt;/math&gt; with a Riemannian metric that is &lt;math&gt; C^2 &lt;/math&gt;-near the standard Euclidean metric), then {{math|''M''}} is a '''volume minimizer''': it cannot be replaced by an orientable Riemannian manifold that fills the same boundary and has less volume without reducing the distance between some boundary points.&lt;ref name="burago2010boundary"&gt;{{ cite journal | title = Boundary rigidity and filling volume minimality of metrics close to a flat one | first = Dmitri | last = Burago | first2 = Sergei V. | last2 = Ivanov | journal = Ann. of Math. |series =  2 | volume = 171 | number = 2 | year = 2010 | pages = 1183–1211 | doi = 10.4007/annals.2010.171.1183 | mr = 2630062 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that if a piece of sphere is sufficiently small (and therefore, nearly flat), then it is a volume minimizer. If this theorem can be extended to large regions (namely, to the whole hemisphere), then the filling area conjecture is true. It has been conjectured that all simple Riemannian manifolds (those that are convex at their boundary, and where every two points are joined by a unique geodesic) are volume minimizers.&lt;ref name="burago2010boundary"/&gt;

The proof that each almost flat manifold {{math|''M''}} is a volume minimizer involves [[Kuratowski embedding|embedding {{math|''M''}} in &lt;math&gt; L^\infty(\partial M)&lt;/math&gt;]], and then showing that any isometric replacement of {{math|''M''}} can also be mapped into the same space &lt;math&gt; L^\infty (\partial M)&lt;/math&gt;, and projected onto {{math|''M''}}, without increasing its volume. This implies that the replacement has not less volume than the original manifold {{math|''M''}}.

In [[professional sports]], a '''franchise player''' is an athlete who is both the best player on their team and one that the team can build their "[[franchising|franchise]]" around for the foreseeable future. The term may be used alongside a particular position name to describe a player, such as a "franchise [[quarterback]]" in American football. They are also sometimes referred to as a [[marquee player]].

Being referred to as a "franchise player" is not synonymous with being protected by being given a "[[franchise tag]]."

== Overview ==
In the United States, outstanding players were referred to as "franchises" at least as far back as the 1950s.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"franchise, n. I. 2. c. (b)" [[OED Online]]. June 2003. [[Oxford University Press]]. June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, the concept of a "franchise" player who single-handedly generates success was commonly understood in the sporting trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Denlinger|first=Ken|title=King Albert No Franchise but a National Jewel: This Morning|work=The Washington Post|date=November 30, 1977|page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Denlinger|first=Ken|title=Team Without a 'Franchise' Player Just Keeps Winning|work=The Washington Post|date=March 6, 1978|page=D5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''franchise player'' was in widespread use by the early 1980s to describe both star rookies like [[John Elway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Dave|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/18/sports/john-elway-leaning-toward-football.html|title= John Elway Leaning Toward Football|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=18 April 1982|accessdate=18 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kelvin Bryant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/11/sports/stars-show-their-1-2-punch.html|title=Stars show their 1, 2 punch|date=11 July 1983|accessdate=18 July 2010|work=The New York Times|last=Wallace|first= William N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and veterans like [[George Brett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brett makes demands|date=4 November 1982|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the term is primarily associated with [[North American]] and [[England|English]] sports,&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnersdictionary.com/search/franchise|title=franchise|work=Merriam-Webster's Learner's Dictionary|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=18 July 2010|}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is sometimes used in reference to athletes in sports outside the United States, such as [[rugby league]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-5060722.html|title=Robbie seizing Bulls by the horns|last=Hadfield|first=Dave|date=2 March 2000|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Association football|football]] players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=There's more to life than Europe|last=Ridley|first=Ian|work=[[The Observer]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/dec/14/sport.comment2|date=14 December 2003|accessdate=19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''functional symptom''' is a [[medicine|medical]] [[symptom]], with no known physical cause. It arises from a problem in the ‘functioning’ of the nervous system, and not due to a structural or pathologically defined disease.  Functional symptoms are increasingly viewed within a framework in which psychological, physiological and biological factors should be considered to be relevant.&lt;ref name="pmid12153926"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mayou R, Farmer A |title=ABC of psychological medicine: Functional somatic symptoms and syndromes |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=325 |issue=7358 |pages=265–8 |year=2002 |pmid=12153926 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.325.7358.265|url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12153926 |pmc=1123778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, there has often been fierce debate about whether certain problems are predominantly related to an abnormality of structure (disease) or function (abnormal nervous system functioning), and what are at one stage posited to be functional symptoms are sometimes later reclassified as organic, as investigative techniques improve.
Thus, on finding itself unable to discover effective treatments or physiological causes for symptoms, the medical profession, in explaining to itself these limitations of its own power over nature, is of course subject to a temptation to minimize the explanatory role played by the many gaps in its own current scientific understanding, and instead to grope for theories of psychosomatic aetiology to account for the physical symptoms that it cannot otherwise explain, and cannot cure. (To caricature this reasoning: "I can't cure you: you must be mad".) It is well established that psychosomatic symptoms are a real phenomenon, so this potential explanation is often plausible, not always easily refutable, and can be reassuring (at least for the doctor). Sometimes it is correct. For example, symptoms associated with [[migraine]], [[epilepsy]], [[schizophrenia]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[stomach ulcers]], [[chronic fatigue syndrome]], [[Lyme disease]] and many other conditions have all tended historically at first to be explained largely as physical manifestations of the sufferer's psychological state of mind; ''until'' such time as new physiological knowledge is eventually gained. At this point, a part of the earlier reliance on psychological explanations often evaporates. Taking a long, historical view, doctors being human, there seems little reason to suppose that this historical pattern of eventual correction of earlier psychological misattribution of symptoms is yet become a thing of the past. Another specific example is [[functional constipation]], which may have psychological or psychiatric causes. However, one type of apparently functional constipation, [[anismus]], may have a neurological (physical) basis.

Whilst misdiagnosis of functional symptoms does occur, in neurology, for example, this appears to occur no more frequently than of other neurological or psychiatric syndromes. However, in order to be quantified, misdiagnosis has to be recognized as such, which can be problematic in such a challenging field as medicine.

A common trend is to see functional symptoms and syndromes such as [[fibromyalgia]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]] and functional neurological symptoms such as [[functional weakness]] as symptoms in which both biological and psychological factors are relevant, without one necessarily being dominant.

B. Tauris|isbn=978-1-58901-910-2|pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a 7th-century [[Church of the East]] [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christian]] [[bishop]] and [[theologian]] best remembered for his [[Syriac language|written]] works on Christian [[asceticism]]. He is regarded as a [[saint]] in the ([[Council of Ephesus|non-Ephesine]]) [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. In the Eastern Orthodox tradition, his [[feast day]] falls, together with 4th-century theologian and hymnographer St. [[Ephrem the Syrian]], on January 28.

==Life==
He was born in the region of [[Christians in the Persian Gulf#Beth Qatraye|Beth Qatraye]] in [[Eastern Arabia]], a mixed Syriac and Arabic speaking region encompassing the south east of [[Mesopotamia]] and the north eastern [[Arabian peninsula]].&lt;ref name="markose"&gt;{{cite book|last=Markose|first=Biji|title=Prayers and Fasts According to Bar Ebroyo (AD 1225/6-1286): A Study on the Prayers and Fasts of the Oriental Churches|year=2004|publisher=LIT Verlag|isbn=9783825867959|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kurian"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kurian|first=George|title=The Encyclopedia of Christian Literature, Volume 2|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=081086987X|pages=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnston"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnston|first=William M.|title=Encyclopedia of Monasticism: A-L|year=2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=1579580904|pages=665}}&lt;/ref&gt; When still quite young, he entered a monastery where he devoted his energies towards the practice of [[asceticism]]. After many years of studying at the library attached to the monastery, he emerged as an authoritative figure in theology. Shortly after, he dedicated his life to [[monasticism]] and became involved in religious education throughout the Beth Qatraye region. When the [[Catholicos]] Georges (680–659) visited Beth Qatraye in the middle of the seventh century to attend a synod, he ordained Isaac bishop of [[Nineveh]] far to the north in [[Assyria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kozah|first1=Mario|last2=Abu-Husayn|first2=Abdulrahim|last3=Al-Murikhi|first3=Saif Shaheen|last4=Al-Thani|first4=Haya|title=The Syriac Writers of Qatar in the Seventh Century|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|year=2014|page=263|edition=print|isbn=978-1463203559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrative duties did not suit his retiring and ascetic bent: he requested to abdicate after only five months, and went south to the wilderness of [[Mount Matout]], a refuge for [[anchorite]]s. There he lived in solitude for many years, eating only three loaves a week with some uncooked vegetables, a detail that never failed to astonish his [[hagiography|hagiographers]]. Eventually blindness and old age forced him to retire to the Assyrian monastery of [[Shabar]] in [[Mesopotamia]], where he died and was buried. At the time of his death he was nearly blind, a fact that some attribute to his devotion to study.

==Legacy==
{{Eastern Orthodox sidebar}}
Isaac is remembered for his spiritual homilies on the inner life, which have a human breadth and theological depth that transcends the [[Christianity]] of the [[Church of the East|Church to which he belonged]]. They survive in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] manuscripts and in later Greek, Arabic, and Georgian translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brock|first1=Sebastian|editor1-last=Patrich|editor1-first=Joseph|title=The Sabaite Heritage in the Orthodox Church from the Fifth Century to the Present|date=2001|publisher=Peeters|location=Louvain|isbn=9042909765|pages=201–208|chapter=Syriac into Greek at Mar Saba: The Translation of St. Isaac the Syrian}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Greek they were translated into Russian.&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Commentary on Song of Songs; Letter on the Soul; Letter on Ascesis and the Monastic Life|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4168/|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaac consciously avoided writing on topics that were disputed or discussed in the contemporary theological debates{{Verify source|date=February 2012}}.  This gives Isaac a certain [[ecumenical]] potential, and is probably the reason that he has come to be venerated and appreciated among many different Christian traditions.

Isaac stands in the tradition of the eastern mystical saints and placed a considerable emphasis on the work of the [[Holy Spirit]].

His melancholic style as well as his affinity towards the sick and dying exerted considerable influence on [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. His writings were continuously studied by monastery circles outside his church during the 8th and 9th century. Moreover, Isaac's conviction that the notion of God punishing men endlessly through the mystery of [[Gehenna]] (the lake of fire, or hell) is not compatible with his all encompassing love can likely be seen as the central thematic conflict in his second treatise of mystical teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, S., trans. (1997). ''The Wisdom of Saint Isaac the Syrian''. pp. 5-9. Fairacres Oxford, England: SLG Press, Convent of the Incarnation. {{ISSN|0307-1405}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaac's writings offer a rare example of a large corpus of ascetical texts written by an experienced hermit and is thus an important writer when it comes to understanding early Christian asceticism.&lt;ref&gt;Hagman, Patrik: The Asceticism of Isaac of Nineveh (Oxford University Press 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
The instructions of Isaac the Syrian came to us in several books.  The First book contains 82 chapters while the Second contains 41.  There is also a Third book which has been translated into Italian and English but has yet to be published in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brock|first=Sebastian P.|title=The Wisdom of St. Isaac of Nineveh|year=2006|publisher=Gorgias Press|location=Piscataway, NJ|isbn=1-59333-335-8|pages=vii-xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here are some examples:

* '''Faith, God’s providence, prayer'''

"To whatever extent a person draws close to God with his intentions, is to what extent God draws close to him with His gifts.

A handful of sand, thrown into the sea, is what sinning is, when compared to God’s [[Divine providence|Providence]] and mercy. Just like an abundant source of water is not impeded by a handful of dust, so is the Creator’s mercy not defeated by the sins of His creations.

The natural that precedes faith is the path toward faith and toward God. Being implanted by God into our nature, it alone convinces us for the need to believe in God, Who had brought everything into being.

Those, in whom the light of faith truly shines, never reach such unashamedness as to ask God: "Give us this," or — "Remove from us this." Because their spiritual eyes — with which they were blessed by that genuine Father, Who with His great love, countlessly transcends any fatherly love — continually view the Father’s Providence, they are not concerned in the slightest about themselves. God can do more than anyone else, and can assist us by a far greater measure than we could ever ask for, or even imagine."

The mouth which is continuously giving thanks receives blessing from God. In the heart that always shows gratitude, grace abides (Brock, 1997).

The aim of prayer is that we should acquire from it love of God, for in prayer are to be found all sorts of reason for loving God (Brock, 1997).

Do not consider a long time spent in worship before God to be wasted (Brock, 1997)

Undistracted prayer is prayer which produces the continual thought of God in the soul (Brock, 1997)

At the time of darkness, more than anything else kneeling is helpful (Brock, 1997).

The more a person enters the struggle for the sake of God, the closer will his heart come to freedom of converse in prayer (Brock, 1997).

* '''Obeying God'''

"To select a good deed depends on the initiator; to realize the intention — that is God’s deed. Consequently, let us adhere to the rule, so that every good intention that comes to us is followed by frequent prayers, appealing to God to not only grant us help, but also if it is pleasing or not to Him. Because not every good intention comes from God, but only those that are beneficial.

Sometimes, a person wishes something good, but God doesn’t help him — maybe because the intention came from the devil and is not for our benefit; or maybe because it is beyond our strength as we have not attained the necessary spiritual level; or maybe because it doesn’t correspond to our calling; or maybe because the time is not right to initiate it; or maybe because we don’t have the necessary knowledge or strength to accomplish it; or maybe because circumstances will not contribute to its success. Besides this, the devil contrives in every way to paint it as something good so that having inclined us toward it, he could upset our spiritual tranquility or inflict harm on us. That’s why it is necessary for us to diligently examine all our good desires. Better still, do everything after seeking counsel."

Begin every action that is for God's sake joyfully (Brock,1997).

Make sure you see to small things, lest otherwise you may push aside important ones (Brock, 1997).

* '''Love towards your neighbor, mercy, non-judgmentalness'''

"Do not demand love from your neighbor, because you will suffer if you don’t receive it; but better still, you indicate your love toward your neighbor and you will settle down. In this way, you will lead your neighbor toward love.

Don’t exchange your love toward your neighbor for some type of object, because in having love toward your neighbor, you acquire within yourself Him, Who is most precious in the whole world. Forsake the petty so as to acquire the great; spurn the excessive and everything meaningless so as to acquire the valuable.

Shelter the sinner if it brings you no harm. Through this you will encourage him toward repentance and reform — and attract the Lord’s mercy to yourself. With a kind word and all possible means, fortify the infirm and the sorrowful and that Right Arm that controls everything, will also support you. With prayers and sorrow of your heart, share your lot with the aggrieved and the source of God’s mercy will open to your entreaties.

When giving, give magnanimously with a look of kindness on your face, and give more than what is asked of you.

Do not distinguish the worthy from the unworthy. Let everyone be equal to you for good deeds, so that you may be able to also attract the unworthy toward goodness, because through outside acts, the soul quickly learns to be reverent before God.

He who shows kindness toward the poor has God as his guardian, and he who becomes poor for the sake of God will acquire abundant treasures. God is pleased when He sees people showing concern for others for His sake. When someone asks you for something, don’t think: "Just in case I might need it, I shall leave it for myself, and God — through other people — will give that person what he requires." These types of thoughts are peculiar to people that are iniquitous and do not know God. A just and generous person would not compromise the honor of helping and relinquish it to another person, and he would never pass up an opportunity to help. Every beggar and every needy person receives the necessary essentials, because God doesn’t neglect anyone. But you, having sent away the destitute with nothing, spurned the honor offered to you by God and thereby, distanced yourself from His grace.

Through God’s providence, he who respects every person for God’s sake, privately acquires help from every human being."&lt;ref&gt;''Isaac the Syrian, Readings, Orthodox Photos.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universal reconciliation==
Wacław Hryniewicz (2007) argues that Brocks translation (1995) of the Second Part of Isaac's writings on Gehenna (discovered 1983) confirm claims of earlier Universalist historians such as [[John Wesley Hanson]] (1899) that Isaac was an advocate of [[universal reconciliation]].&lt;ref&gt;Wacław Hryniewicz ''The challenge of our hope: Christian faith in dialogue'' 2007 The 7th-century mystic, Isaac the Syrian, known also as Isaac of Nineveh is, in the history of the Church, one of the most courageous supporters of the eschatological hope of universal salvation.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jacint Verdaguer i Santaló''' ({{IPA-ca|ʒəˈsim bəɾðəˈɣe}}; May 17, 1845 – June 10, 1902) was a Catalan writer, regarded as one of the greatest poets of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] literature and a prominent literary figure of the [[Renaixença]], a [[Romantic nationalism|cultural revival]] movement of the late [[Romanticism|Romantic]] era.  The bishop [[Josep Torras i Bages]], one of the main figures of [[Catalan nationalism]], called him the "Prince of Catalan poets".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/spain/articles/10-catalan-poets-you-need-to-know/|title=10 Catalan Poets You Need to Know|last=Jessop|first=Tara|date=2017-04-07|work=Culture Trip|access-date=2018-01-02|archive-url=|archive-date=2017|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known as ''mossèn'' (Father) Cinto Verdaguer, because of his career as a priest, and informally also simply "mossèn Cinto" (with Cinto being a short form of Jacint).

== Life ==
He was born in [[Folgueroles]], a town on the [[Plain of Vic]], in the ''[[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]]'' of [[Osona (comarca)|Osona]] ([[Province of Barcelona]]) to a modest family who valued learning. His father, Josep Verdaguer i Ordeix ([[Tavèrnoles]], 1817 – [[Folgueroles]], 1876), was a brickmason and farmer. His mother, Josepa Santaló i Planes ([[Folgueroles]], 1819–1871), a housewife and farmer, was to exercise great influence over young Jacint, as she conveyed to him a love of literature, especially poetry, and was a deeply religious woman.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Jacint Verdaguer to the writer Marià Aguiló ("Carta a Marià Aguiló"), Can Tona, February 8, 1871, in ''Jacint Verdaguer. Ruta verdagueriana de Folgueroles'', edited by Ricard Torrents. Vic: Amics de Verdaguer and Casa Museu Verdaguer (Estudis Verdaguerians. Sèrie La Damunt), 1992, p. 17-18. The letter is also reproduced as part of the [http://www.mapaliterari.cat/ca/api/guia/6/jacint-verdaguer/ruta-verdaguer-a-folgueroles Ruta Verdaguer a Folgueroles], Mapa Literari website) {{ca_icon}}; Also available in ''Epistolari de Jacint Verdaguer'', with transcription and notes by Josep M. de Casacuberta and Joan Torrent i Fàbregas.

In 1855, at the age of 10, he entered the [[Seminary]] of [[Vic]], as was expected for a child who was not the first-born under the system of [[primogeniture]] and had to make his livelihood without relying on an inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Pinyol i Torrents, Ramon: "Introduction", in ''Selected Poems of Jacint Verdaguer. A Bilingual Edition'', edited and translated by Ronald Puppo. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2007, 339 pp, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, he had lived like the other children in his town. The anecdotes told about him show that he stood out from his peers for his intelligence, astuteness and courage, as well as his athletic constitution. He displayed a balanced attitude without any apparent religious inclinations.

In 1863, when he was 18, he started to work as a tutor for a family at the Can Tona [[masia]] (where he also helped out on the farm), while he continued to study. Can Tona is in the municipal district of Sant Martí de Riudeperes, today [[Calldetenes]] ([[Osona]]). In 1865, he participated in [[Barcelona]]'s [[Jocs Florals]]—or "Floral Games"—poetry contest and won four prizes. The next year he won two prizes in the same [[Jocs Florals]].

On September 24, 1870, he was ordained a priest by the bishop Lluís Jordà in [[Vic]], and in October that same year, he said his first Mass, in the [[Saint George|Sant Jordi]] hermitage. The next day he said his second Mass in the Sant Francesc hermitage near Vic. In 1871, his mother died (January 17) at the age of 52. On September 1 he was appointed bishop [[Coadjutor bishop|coadjutor]] of the small town of Vinyoles d'Orís and three days later he took up his charge.

In 1873, he published the ''cant'' (ode or song) "Passió de Nostre Senyor Jesucrist" (Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ). He left Vinyoles d'Orís for health reasons and moved to [[Vic]]. He went on a trip to [[Roussillon]] and saw the mountain, El [[Canigó]], possibly for the first time. In December, he joined the Companyia Transatlàntica trans-Atlantic steamship company as a chaplain because he was prescribed sea air for his health; he embarked in [[Cádiz]] bound for [[Havana]].

On September 8, 1876, his father died at the age of 65. On board the "Ciudad Condal", on the return voyage from [[Cuba]], Jacint Verdaguer finished his epic poem ''L'Atlàntida''. In November he entered the palace of the [[Marqués de Comillas|Marquis of Comillas]] as an [[alms]] chaplain.

In 1877, when he was 32, and having returned from his journey, the jury of the [[Jocs Florals]] awarded him the special prize of the [[Diputació de Barcelona|Diputation]] of [[Barcelona]] for ''[[L'Atlàntida]]''. Now he had earned his reputation as a poet.

In 1878, he traveled to Rome, where he was granted an audience with Pope [[Leo XIII]]. They discussed Verdaguer's poem ''L'Atlàntida''. In 1880, as the winner of three prizes in the [[Jocs Florals]], he was proclaimed "Master of the Gay Sciences" (''Mestre en Gai Saber''). That same year he published his book of poetry, ''[[Montserrat (Verdaguer)|Montserrat]]'', which included "Llegenda de Montserrat", a legend (or two) in the form of a poem with 13 cantos.

In 1883, the Barcelona City Council published a print-run of a hundred thousand copies of his "Oda a Barcelona" (Ode to Barcelona), a 46-stanza poem. Such a print-run was quite a remarkable given that the population of Barcelona at the time was 350,000, which would have amounted to about a copy per household.&lt;ref&gt;Notes to "To Barcelona" in ''Selected Poems of Jacint Verdaguer: A Bilingual Edition'', edited and translated by Ronald Puppo, with an introduction by Ramon Pinyol i Torrents, University of Chicago Press, 2007, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 39, Verdaguer traveled to Paris, [[Switzerland]], Germany and Russia.  On March 21, 1886, when he was 41 years old, Bishop Morgades crowned him 'Poet of Catalonia' in the monastery of [[Ripoll]]. He published the epic poem ''[[Canigó]]'' and made a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]].

In 1893, following controversy about aspects of his work as a priest, he left the post of alms chaplain at the [[Marqués de Comillas]]' palace. The publication of the trilogy ''Jesús Infant'' was completed, and he was assigned to the sanctuary of La Gleva.  For a period, he was stripped of his office as priest, although this was eventually restored.  In 1894, the books ''Roser de tot l'any'' and ''Veus del bon pastor'' were published. On March 31 he left the sanctuary of La Gleva.

On May 17, 1902, on his 57th birthday, he moved from his home at Carrer Aragó 235 in Barcelona to the country house known as [[Vil·la Joana]], in [[Vallvidrera]] (Barcelona), where he hoped to convalesce.  On June 10, he died in Vil·la Joana, which is now one of the [[Barcelona City History Museum]] (MUHBA) heritage sites.

Verdaguer was buried in [[Montjuïc Cemetery]] in Barcelona.

'''Joaquim Pijoan''' ([[Santa Cristina d'Aro]], [[Baix Empordà]], 27 March 1948) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] painter and writer from [[Catalonia]].

His published works are ''Somni'' (1983), ''Sayonara Barcelona'' (2007) and ''Amor a Venècia'' (2007). He considers painting as his passion, but he has become famous by two literary awards: the [[Premi Documenta de narrativa|Documenta]] (1982) by ''Somni'' and, especially, the [[Premi Sant Jordi de novel·la]] (2006) for his work ''Sayonara Barcelona''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grup62.cat/autor-joaquim-pijoan-arbocer-000052244.html |title= Joaquim Pijoan Arbocer|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 9 April 2015 |website={{url|grup62.cat/}} |publisher= [[Grup 62]] |access-date= 9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only material published between this two dates was in ''[[Revista de Girona]]''.

=== Plot ===
Abraham is a painter who left [[Barcelona]] twenty-five years ago, without telling anyone, leaving behind many people, especially a pregnant girl, and now he is returning from Japan, where he has been living, to say goodbye to the city and its past and not come back ever again. Abraham understands that everything on this trip has changed too, even himself, completely tied to Japanese culture and not to the West, the friends and especially the city, which has become a thematic park where it is very difficult to hear someone speaking Catalan.

The most interesting of all is how this novel is written, first with narrator in third person who observes his characters, so that even as we find him as a character in the novel, as a private detective who follows them and at one point explains us the reason for writing this text. We also find sentences in first person with the characters narrating their views. These effects give great [[Polyphony (literature)|polyphony]] in the novel and they are a resource of great interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Puigdevall|first= Ponç |last2= |first2= |date= 15 March 2007|title= Un dia tornaré|url= http://elpais.com/diario/2007/03/15/quaderncat/1173923124_850215.html |journal= |publisher= [[El País]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Josef Burg''' (May 30, 1912 – August 10, 2009) was an award-winning [[Jewish]] Soviet [[Yiddish]] writer, author, publisher and journalist.&lt;ref name=jta&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Yiddish author Josef Burg dies in Ukraine |url=http://www.jta.org/2009/08/11/news-opinion/world/yiddish-author-josef-burg-dies-in-ukraine|work=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|publisher= |date=August 11, 2009|accessdate=August 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burg was born on May 30, 1912, in the town of [[Vyzhnytsia]],&lt;ref name=jta/&gt; in the region of [[Bukovina]], [[Austria–Hungary]]. In the years before World War I, the city of [[Chernivtsi]], also called Czernowitz in both German and [[Yiddish]], was the capital of the Bukovina region and a center of Yiddish language and culture.&lt;ref name=jta/&gt; The region became part of [[Romania]] following World War I.

Burg published his first professional writing in the ''[[Chernovitser Bleter]]'', a Yiddish newspaper, in 1934.&lt;ref name=jta/&gt; The Romanian government closed and banned the ''Chernovitser Bleter'' in 1938, on charges of Bolshevik propaganda.&lt;ref name=jta/&gt;

Burg survived the [[Holocaust]] during [[World War II]], but lost his entire family.&lt;ref name=jta/&gt; He took refuge in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=jta/&gt;

Burg continued to write and publish his works well into his 90s.  In 1990, Burg revived the once banned ''Chernovitser Bleter'' newspaper as a monthly publication.&lt;ref name=jta/&gt;

Josef Burg died on August 10, 2009, in [[Chernivtsi]], [[Ukraine]], at the age of 97.&lt;ref name=jta/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4579">In [[mathematics]], the '''Köthe conjecture''' is a problem in [[ring theory]], open {{As of|2010|lc=on}}. It is formulated in various ways. Suppose that ''R'' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. One way to state the conjecture is that if ''R'' has no [[nil ideal]], other than {0}, then it has no nil [[one-sided ideal]], other than {0}.

This question was posed in 1930 by [[Gottfried Köthe]] (1905–1989). The Köthe conjecture has been shown to be true for various classes of rings, such as [[polynomial identity ring]]s&lt;ref&gt;John C. McConnell, James Christopher Robson, Lance W. Small , ''Noncommutative Noetherian rings'' (2001), p. 484.&lt;/ref&gt; and right [[Noetherian ring]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Lam, T.Y., ''A First Course in Noncommutative Rings'' (2001), p.164.&lt;/ref&gt; but a general solution remains elusive.

==Equivalent formulations==
The conjecture has several different formulations:&lt;ref&gt;Krempa, J., &amp;#8220;Logical connections between some open problems concerning nil rings,&amp;#8221; ''Fundamenta Mathematicae'' '''76''' (1972), no. 2, 121&amp;ndash;130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lam, T.Y., ''A First Course in Noncommutative Rings'' (2001), p.171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lam, T.Y., ''Exercises in Classical Ring Theory'' (2003), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;
# (Köthe conjecture) In any ring, the sum of two nil left ideals is nil.
# In any ring, the sum of two one-sided nil ideals is nil. 
# In any ring, every nil left or right ideal of the ring is contained in the [[Radical of a ring#The upper nil radical or K.C3.B6the radical|upper nil radical]] of the ring.
# For any ring ''R'' and for any nil ideal ''J'' of ''R'', then the matrix ideal M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''J'') is a nil ideal of M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') for every ''n''.
# For any ring ''R'' and for any nil ideal ''J'' of ''R'', then the matrix ideal M&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;(''J'') is a nil ideal of M&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').
# For any ring ''R'', the upper nilradical of M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is the set of matrices with entries from the upper nilradical of ''R'' for every positive integer ''n''.
# For any ring ''R'' and for any nil ideal ''J'' of ''R'', the polynomials with indeterminate ''x'' and coefficients from ''J'' lie in the [[Jacobson radical]] of the polynomial ring ''R''[''x''].
# For any ring ''R'', the Jacobson radical of ''R''[''x''] consists of the polynomials with coefficients from the upper nilradical of ''R''.

==Related problems==
A conjecture by Amitsur read: "If ''J'' is a nil ideal in ''R'', then ''J''[''x''] is a nil ideal of the polynomial ring ''R''[''x'']."&lt;ref&gt;Amitsur, S. A. ''Nil radicals. Historical notes and some new results'' Rings, modules and radicals (Proc. Internat. Colloq., Keszthely, 1971), pp. 47–65. Colloq. Math. Soc. János Bolyai, Vol. 6, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; This conjecture, if true, would have proven the Köthe conjecture through the equivalent statements above, however a counterexample was produced by [[Agata Smoktunowicz]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Agata Smoktunowicz|Smoktunowicz, Agata]]. ''Polynomial rings over nil rings need not be nil'' J. Algebra 233 (2000), no. 2, p. 427–436.&lt;/ref&gt; While not a disproof of the Köthe conjecture, this fueled suspicions that the Köthe conjecture may be false in general.&lt;ref&gt;Lam, T.Y., ''A First Course in Noncommutative Rings'' (2001), p.171.&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{harv|Kegel|1962}}, it was proven that a ring which is the direct sum of two nilpotent subrings is itself nilpotent. The question arose whether or not "nilpotent" could be replaced with "locally nilpotent" or "nil". Partial progress was made when Kelarev&lt;ref&gt;Kelarev, A. V., A sum of two locally nilpotent rings may not be nil, Arch. Math. 60 (1993), p431–435.&lt;/ref&gt; produced an example of a ring which isn't nil, but is the direct sum of two locally nilpotent rings. This demonstrates that Kegel's question with "locally nilpotent" replacing "nilpotent" is answered in the negative.

The sum of a nilpotent subring and a nil subring is always nil.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrero, M., Puczylowski, E. R., On rings which are sums of two subrings, Arch. Math. 53 (1989), p4–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

When stories lead to a [[narrative therapy|restorying]] of the past [[narrative]], or the future [[antenarrative]], they become '''living stories'''.&lt;ref&gt;Twotrees, K. (1997). Presentation at the Organizational Behavior Teaching conference, meeting at Case Western Reserve, Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[David Boje]] says “living story has many authors and as a collective force has a life of its own. We live in living stories.”&lt;ref&gt;Boje, D. M. (2008). Storytelling organizations, London: Sage Page 338&lt;/ref&gt; In the work of Native scholar [[Twotrees]], living stories have a mind, a time, and a place.&lt;ref&gt;Twotrees, K. (2000).

'''Note:'''  The usage of the reflexive pronoun is broad.  Of course, it is used as a reflexive pronoun as in '''"minnõn ''eņtšõn'' um vajag...,"''' meaning "I need..." [lit: to myself is necessary...]. However, the pronoun can also express possession; it frequently replaces the genitive forms of the personal pronouns.  For example:  '''"ma sīeda kūliz ''eņtš'' izast,"''' or "I heard it from my father."  Also, reflexive pronouns can be used in adverbial expressions: '''"täm ''eņtš'' ie,"''' "this same night."

'''Meir Shalev''' ({{lang-he|מאיר שלו}}; born 29 July 1948)  is an [[Israel]]i writer and newspaper columnist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meir Shalev|url=http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/people/meir-shalev|work=New York Journal of Books|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the daily [[Yedioth Ahronoth]] . Shalev's books have been translated into 26 languages.&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt;

== Biography ==
Shalev was born in [[Nahalal]], Israel. Later he lived at [[Ginosar]] with his family. He is the son of the [[Jerusalem]] poet [[Yitzhak Shalev]]. Shalev was drafted into the IDF in 1966, and did his military service in the [[Golani Brigade]]. He served as a soldier, a [[squad leader]]  in the brigade's [[reconnaissance]] company. Shalev fought in [[The Six Day War]],&lt;ref&gt;Meir Shalev, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3514632,00.html What happened to our army?], [[Ynetnews]], 04.03.2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and a few months after the war was injured in a friendly fire incident.

His cousin [[Zeruya Shalev]] is also a writer. He began his career by presenting ironic features on television and radio. He also moderated the program ''Erev Shabbat'' ("Friday night") on Israel channel one. His first novel, ''[[The Blue Mountain]]'', was published in 1988.

Shalev also writes non-fiction, children's books and a weekly column in the weekend edition of ''[[Yediot Ahronot]]''.

He currently lives in the [[Jezreel Valley]].&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt;

==Views and opinions==
Shalev identifies with the Israeli left and believes that the conflict with the Palestinians can be resolved by establishing two states for two peoples. However, he is disappointed with the extremism in the Palestinian camp, saying, "Radical Palestinians still say that the only solution would be for all Jews to pack their bags and return to where their grandparents came from. When there are no more Jews left in the Middle East, then the problem is solved, according to their logic. As long as they continue to think that way, there will be no peace. We are here and we are going to stay. Only after that fact is generally accepted can progress be made."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-israeli-author-meir-shalev-even-the-left-was-in-favor-of-striking-hamas-a-599142.html Israeli author Meir Shalev: Even the left was in favor of striking Hamas]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moroccan Arabic language'''  or '''Moroccan Darija''' ({{lang|ary|الدارجة}}, {{IPA-ar|ddæɾiʒæ|}} in Morocco) is a member of the [[Maghrebi Arabic]] [[language continuum]] spoken in [[Morocco]]. It is mutually intelligible to some extent with [[Algerian Arabic language]] and to a lesser extent with [[Tunisian Arabic language]]. It has been heavily influenced mainly by the [[Berber languages]] and to a lesser extent by [[Latin]] ([[African Romance]]), [[French language|French]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

While [[Modern Standard Arabic]] is not spoken in daily life and is an only used for written government communications and in the written press, Moroccan is the spoken common language of Morocco, and has a strong presence in Moroccan television entertainment, cinema and commercial advertising. 

Sahrawi Hassaniya Arabic spoken in the disputed Moroccan-controlled [[Western Sahara]] is usually considered as a separate spoken Arabic language and is poorly mutually intelligible with Moroccan Arabic.  

Moroccan language has many regional dialects and accents as well. Its mainstream dialect is the one used in [[Casablanca]], [[Rabat]] and [[Fez, Morocco|Fas]] and therefore it dominates the media eclipsing the other regional dialects like the ones spoken in [[Tangiers]] and [[Oujda]]. 

Moroccan is spoken as a first language by about 50% to 75% of Morocco's population. The other half speaks one of the Tamazight languages. Educated Moroccan Tamazight-speakers can communicate in mainstream Moroccan Arabic. 

==Dialects==
Moroccan language was formed of several dialects of Arabic several belonging to two genetically different groups: [[Pre-Hilalian Arabic dialects|pre-Hilalian]] and [[Hilalian dialects|Hilalian]] dialects.&lt;ref name="Bern"&gt;A. Bernard &amp; P. Moussard, « Arabophones et Amazighophones au Maroc », ''[[Annales de Géographie]]'', no.183 (1924), pp.267-282.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caubet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caubet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy1" /&gt;

===Pre-Hilalian dialects===
[[File:Nord du Maroc, carte ethno-linguistique.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Ethno-linguistic map of northern Morocco: Pre-Hilalian speaking areas in purple (Mountain Arabic) and blue (old urban, village).]]
Pre-Hilalian dialects are a result of early [[Arabization]] phases of the [[Maghreb]], from the 7th to the 12th centuries, concerning the main urban settlements, the harbors, the religious centres (''zaouias'') as well as the main trade routes. The dialects are generally classified in three types: (old) urban, "village" and "mountain" sedentary and Jewish dialects.&lt;ref name="Caubet"&gt;D. Caubet, [http://ieiop.unizar.es/pub/05caubet.pdf Questionnaire de dialectologie du Maghreb], in: EDNA vol.5 (2000-2001), pp.73-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Versteegh" /&gt; In Morocco, several pre-Hilalian dialects are spoken:
*(Old) urban dialects of [[Fes]], [[Rabat]], [[Salé]], [[Taza]], [[Tetouan]], [[Ouezzane]], [[Chefchaouen]], [[Tangiers]], [[Asilah]], [[Larache]], [[Ksar el-Kebir]], [[Meknes]] and [[Marrakech]].&lt;ref name="Levy1"&gt;S. Levy, Repères pour une histoire linguistique du Maroc, in: EDNA no.1 (1996), pp.127-137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A"&gt;L. Messaoudi, Variations linguistiques: images urbaines et sociales, in: Cahiers de Sociolinguistique, no.6 (2001), pp.87-98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The dialects of Ouezzane, Chefchaouen, Asilah, Larache, Ksar el-Kebir and Tangiers are influenced by the neighbouring mountain dialects. The dialects of Marrakech and Meknes are influenced by Bedouin dialects. The old urban dialect formerly spoken in [[Azemmour]] is extinct.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jebli Arabic|Mountain dialects]] of the southern and western [[Rif]] can be classified in two subdialects: northern dialects (spoken by tribes of Masmouda and Ghomara descent) and southern dialects (spoken by tribes of Zenata and Sanhaja descent).&lt;ref name="Levy1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zunz"&gt;A. Zouggari &amp; J. Vignet-Zunz,Jbala: Histoire et société, dans Sciences Humaines, (1991) ({{ISBN|2-222-04574-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sedentary ("village") dialects of [[Moulay Idriss Zerhoun|Zerhoun]] and [[Sefrou]] and their neighboring tribes (Zerahna tribe for Zerhoun; Kechtala, Behalil and Yazgha tribes for Sefrou), remnants of pre-Hilalian dialects that were more widely spoken before the 12th century.
*[[Judeo-Moroccan Arabic|Judeo-Moroccan]], nearly extinct but with an extensive remnant literature.

===Hilalian dialects===
Hilalian, or Bedouin, dialects were introduced to Morocco following the settlement of several Hilalian and Mâqilian tribes in western Morocco brought by the [[Berbers|Berber]] [[Almohads|Almohad]] king [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur|Yaqub Mansur]].

The [[Hilalian dialects]] spoken in Morocco belong to the Mâqil subgroup,&lt;ref name="Versteegh"&gt;K. Versteegh, [http://acc.teachmideast.org/texts.php?module_id=1&amp;reading_id=113&amp;sequence=5 Dialects of Arabic: Maghreb Dialects], teachmideast.org&lt;/ref&gt; a family that includes three main dialectal areas: [[Western Morocco Arabic|western Morocco]] ([[Doukkala-Abda|Doukkala, Abda]], [[Tadla]], [[Chaouia (region)|Chaouia]], [[Gharb-Chrarda-Béni Hssen|Gharb]], Zaers and Sraghna), eastern Morocco ([[Oriental (Morocco)|L'Oriental]] and the [[Oujda]] area) and western Algeria (central and western [[:fr:Oranie|Oranie]]&lt;ref&gt;J. Grand'Henry, [https://books.google.fr/books?id=Orc3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA5 Les parlers arabes de la région du Mzāb], Brill, 1976, pp.4-5&lt;/ref&gt;), and the southernmost [[Hassaniya]] area (southern Morocco, [[Western Sahara]] and [[Mauritania]]).&lt;ref name="ElhimerZones"&gt;M. El Himer, [http://elhimer.com/images/publications/zones.pdf Zones linguistiques du Maroc arabophone: contacts et effets à Salé], in: Between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, Studies on Contemporary Arabic, 7th AIDA Conference, 2006, held in Vienna&lt;/ref&gt; Among the dialects, Hassaniya is often considered as distinct from Moroccan Darija.

Modern urban [[koine]]s are also based on the Hilalian dialects and have mainly Hilalian features.

According to Elimam's studies, the origin of this language would go back to over 3,000 years, being a singular evolution of the Punic language spoken by the Carthaginians under Amazigh influence. This Semitic language would be strongly Arabized after the Arab invasion to be virtually assimilated into the language of the conquerors.

== Vocabulary ==

=== Substrates ===
Moroccan language is characterized by a strong [[Amazigh languages|Amazigh]] as well as [[Latin]] ([[African Romance]]) [[Stratum (linguistics)|stratum]]&lt;ref name="HaspelmathTadmor2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Haspelmath|author2=Uri Tadmor|title=Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HnKeVbwTwyYC&amp;pg=PA195|date=22 December 2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-021844-2|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Following the [[Arab conquest of North Africa|Arab conquest]], [[Amazigh languages]] remained widely spoken. During their [[Arabisation]], some Amazigh tribes became bilingual for generations before abandoning their language for Arabic; however, they kept a substantial Amazigh stratum that increases from the east to the west of the Maghreb, making Moroccan dialects the ones most influenced by Amazigh.

More recently, the influx of [[Al Andalus|Andalusi people]] and Spanish-speaking–[[Moriscos]] (between the 15th and the 17th centuries) influenced urban dialects with Spanish substrate (and loanwords).

=== Vocabulary and loanwords ===
Most vocabulary of Moroccan Arabic language is derived from [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Amazigh languages|Amazigh]], supplemented by [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] loanwords. 

There are noticeable lexical differences between Moroccan and most other Arabic languages. Some words are essentially unique to Moroccan: ''daba'' "now". Many others, however, are characteristic of Maghrebi Arabic as a whole including both innovations and unusual retentions of Classical vocabulary that disappeared elsewhere, such as ''hbeṭ''' "go down" from Classical ''habaṭ''. Others are shared with [[Algerian Arabic]] such as ''hḍeṛ'' "talk", from Classical ''hadhar'' "babble", and ''temma'' "there", from Classical ''thamma''.

There are a number of Moroccan language dictionaries in existence:
* ''A Dictionary of Moroccan Arabic: Moroccan-English'', ed. [[Richard S. Harrell]] &amp; Harvey Sobelman. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 1963 (reprinted 2004.)
* ''Mu`jam al-fuṣḥā fil-`āmmiyyah al-maghribiyyah'' معجم الفصحى في العامية المغربية, Muhammad Hulwi, Rabat: al-Madaris 1988.
* ''Dictionnaire Colin d'arabe dialectal marocain'' (Rabat, éditions Al Manahil, ministère des Affaires Culturelles), by a Frenchman named Georges Séraphin Colin, who devoted nearly all his life to it from 1921 to 1977. The dictionary contains 60,000 entries and was published in 1993, after Colin's death.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===
One of the most notable features of Moroccan language is the collapse of short vowels. Initially, short {{IPA|/ă/}} and {{IPA|/ĭ/}} were merged into a phoneme {{IPA|/ə/}} (however, some speakers maintain a difference between {{IPA|/ă/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}} when adjacent to pharyngeal {{IPA|/ʕ/}} and {{IPA|/ħ/}}).  This phoneme was then deleted entirely in most positions; for the most part, it is maintained only in the position /...CəC#/ or /...CəCC#/ (where C represents any consonant and # indicates a word boundary), i.e. when appearing as the last vowel of a word.  When {{IPA|/ə/}} is not deleted, it is pronounced as a very short vowel, tending towards {{IPA|[ɐ]}} in the vicinity of [[emphatic consonants]], {{IPA|[a]}} in the vicinity of pharyngeal {{IPA|/ʕ/}} and {{IPA|/ħ/}} (for speakers who have merged /ă/ and {{IPA|/ə/}} in this environment), and {{IPA|[ɪ]}} elsewhere.  Original short {{IPA|/ŭ/}} usually merges with {{IPA|/ə/}} except in the vicinity of a labial or velar consonant.  In positions where {{IPA|/ə/}} was deleted, /ŭ/ was also deleted, and is maintained only as [[labialization]] of the adjacent labial or velar consonant; where {{IPA|/ə/}} is maintained, {{IPA|/ŭ/}} surfaces as {{IPA|[ʊ]}}. This deletion of short vowels can result in long strings of consonants (a feature shared with Amazigh and certainly derived from it). These clusters are never simplified; instead, consonants occurring between other consonants tend to syllabify, according to a sonorance hierarchy.  Similarly, and unlike most other Arabic dialects, doubled consonants are never simplified to a single consonant, even when at the end of a word or preceding another consonant.

Some dialects are more conservative in their treatment of short vowels.  For example, some dialects allow {{IPA|/ŭ/}} in more positions.  Dialects of the Sahara, and eastern dialects near the border of Algeria, preserve a distinction between {{IPA|/ă/}} and {{IPA|/ĭ/}} and allow {{IPA|/ă/}} to appear at the beginning of a word, e.g. {{IPA|/ăqsˤărˤ/}} "shorter" (standard {{IPA|/qsˤərˤ/}}), {{IPA|/ătˤlăʕ/}} "go up!" (standard {{IPA|/tˤlăʕ/}} or {{IPA|/tˤləʕ/}}), {{IPA|/ăsˤħab/}} "friends" (standard {{IPA|/sˤħab/}}).

Long {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} are maintained as semi-long vowels, which are substituted for both short and long vowels in most borrowings from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Long {{IPA|/a/, /i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} also have many more allophones than in most other dialects; in particular, {{IPA|/a/, /i/, /u/}} appear as {{IPA|[ɑ], [e], [o]}} in the vicinity of [[emphatic consonants]] and {{IPAblink|q}}, {{IPAblink|ɾ}}, {{IPAblink|ħ}}, {{IPAblink|ʕ}}, but {{IPA|[æ], [i], [u]}} elsewhere. (Most other Arabic dialects only have a similar variation for the phoneme {{IPA|/a/}}.) In some dialects, such as that of [[Marrakech]], front-rounded and other allophones also exist. Allophones in vowels usually do not exist in [[loanwords]].

Emphatic spreading (i.e. the extent to which emphatic consonants affect nearby vowels) occurs much less than in many other dialects.  Emphasis spreads fairly rigorously towards the beginning of a word and into prefixes, but much less so towards the end of a word.  Emphasis spreads consistently from a consonant to a directly following vowel, and less strongly when separated by an intervening consonant, but generally does not spread rightwards past a full vowel.  For example, {{IPA|/bidˤ-at/ [bedɑt͡s]}} "eggs" ({{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} both affected), {{IPA|/tˤʃaʃ-at/ [tʃɑʃæt͡s]}} "sparks" (rightmost {{IPA|/a/}} not affected), {{IPA|/dˤrˤʒ-at/ [drˤʒæt͡s]}} "stairs" ({{IPA|/a/}} usually not affected), {{IPA|/dˤrb-at-u/ [drˤbat͡su]}} "she hit him" (with {{IPA|[a]}} variable but tending to be in between {{IPA|[ɑ]}} and {{IPA|[æ]}}; no effect on {{IPA|/u/}}),  {{IPA|/tˤalib/ [tɑlib]}} "student" ({{IPA|/a/}} affected but not {{IPA|/i/}}).  Contrast, for example, [[Egyptian Arabic]], where emphasis tends to spread forward and backward to both ends of a word, even through several syllables.

Emphasis is audible mostly through its effects on neighboring vowels or syllabic consonants, and through the differing pronunciation of {{IPA|/t/ [t͡s]}} and {{IPA|/tˤ/ [t]}}.  Actual pharyngealization of "emphatic" consonants is weak and may be absent entirely.  In contrast with some dialects, vowels adjacent to emphatic consonants are pure; there is no diphthong-like transition between emphatic consonants and adjacent front vowels.

Phonetic notes: 
* Non-emphatic {{IPA|/t/}} In normal circumstances, is pronounced with noticeable [[affrication]], almost like {{IPA|[t͡s]}} (still distinguished from a sequence of {{IPA|/t/}} + {{IPA|/s/}}), and hence is easily distinguishable from emphatic {{IPA|/tˤ/}} which can be pronounced as {{IPA|[t]}}.  However, in some recent loanwords from European languages, a non-affricated, non-emphatic {{IPAblink|t}} appears, distinguished from emphatic {{IPA|/tˤ/}} primarily by its lack of effect on adjacent vowels (see above; an alternative analysis is possible).
* /{{IPA|mˤʷ}}, {{IPA|bˤʷ}}, {{IPA|fˤʷ}}/ are very distinct consonants that only occur geminated, and almost always come at the beginning of a word.  They function completely differently from other emphatic consonants: They are pronounced with heavy pharyngealization, affect adjacent short/unstable vowels but not full vowels, and are pronounced with a noticeable diphthongal off-glide between one of these consonants and a following front vowel.  Most of their occurrences can be analyzed as underlying sequences of {{IPA|/mw/}}, {{IPA|/fw/}}, {{IPA|/bw/}} (which appear frequently in diminutives, for example).  However, a few lexical items appear to have independent occurrences of these phonemes, e.g. {{IPA|/mˤmˤʷ-/}} "mother" (with attached possessive, e.g. {{IPA|/mˤmˤʷək/}} "your mother").
*{{IPAslink|p}} and {{IPAslink|v}} occur mostly in recent borrowings from European languages, and may be assimilated to {{IPA|/b/}} or {{IPA|/f/}} in some speakers.
*Unlike in most other Arabic dialects (but, again, similar to Amazigh), non-emphatic {{IPA|/r/}} and emphatic {{IPA|/rˤ/}} are two entirely separate phonemes, almost never contrasting in related forms of a word.
*{{IPA|/lˤ/}} is rare in native words; in nearly all cases of native words with vowels indicating the presence of a nearby emphatic consonant, there is a nearby triggering {{IPA|/tˤ/}}, {{IPA|/dˤ/}}, {{IPA|/sˤ/}}, {{IPA|/zˤ/}} or {{IPA|/rˤ/}}.  Many recent European borrowings appear to require ({{IPA link|ɫ|lˤ}}) or some other unusual emphatic consonant in order to account for the proper vowel allophones; but an alternative analysis is possible for these words where the vowel allophones are considered to be (marginal) phonemes on their own.
*Original {{IPA|/q/}} splits lexically into {{IPA|/q/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} in most dialects but {{IPA|/q/}} is preserved all the time in all of the big cities such as [[Casablanca]], [[Fes]], [[Tangier]], etc. and all of the montagneious regions; for all words, both alternatives exist.
*Original {{IPA|/dʒ/}} normally appears as {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, but as {{IPA|/ɡ/}} (sometimes {{IPA|/d/}}) if a sibilant, lateral or rhotic consonnant appears later in the same stem: {{IPA|/ɡləs/}} "he sat" (MSA {{IPA|/dʒalas/}}), {{IPA|/ɡzzar/}} "butcher" (MSA {{IPA|/dʒazzaːr/}}), {{IPA|/duz/}} "go past" (MSA {{IPA|/dʒuːz/}}) like in western [[Algerian Arabic|Algerian]] dialects.
*Original {{IPA|/s/}} is converted to {{IPA|/ʃ/}} if {{IPA|/ʃ/}} occurs elsewhere in the same stem, and {{IPA|/z/}} is similarly converted to {{IPA|/ʒ/}} as a result of a following {{IPA|/ʒ/}}: {{IPA|/ʃəmʃ/}} "sun" vs. MSA {{IPA|/ʃams/}}, {{IPA|/ʒuʒ/}} "two" vs. MSA {{IPA|/zawdʒ/}} "pair", {{IPA|/ʒaʒ/}} "glass" vs. MSA {{IPA|/zudʒaːdʒ/}}, etc.  This does not apply to recent borrowings from MSA (e.g. {{IPA|/mzaʒ/}} "disposition"), nor as a result of the negative suffix {{IPA|/ʃ/}} or {{IPA|/ʃi/}}.
*the gemination of the flap {{IPA|/ɾ/}} results in a trill {{IPA|/r/}}.

== Writing ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}

Moroccan Darija is not often written (most books and magazines are in [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or [[Modern Standard Arabic]]; most [[Qur'an]] books are written in [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Classical Arabic]], or [[Modern Standard Arabic]]), and there is no universally standard written system.&lt;ref&gt;Some effort has recently been made in that direction with the [[KtbDarija]] [http://www.ktbdarija.com] (literally "WriteDarija") project, which proposes a Latin alphabet for writing Darija and a set of keyboard layouts for writing in this alphabet.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a loosely standardized Latin system used for writing Moroccan Darija in electronic media, such as texting and chat, often based on sound-letter correspondences from French, English or Spanish ('sh' or 'ch' for English 'sh', 'u' or 'ou' for English 'u', etc.) and using numbers to represent sounds not found in French or English (2-3-6-7-9 used for ق-ح-ط-ع-ء).

However, most systems used for writing Moroccan Darija in linguistic works largely agree among each other. A Moroccan alphabet, ''Abazidiya Magribiya'', is being developed:{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} http://www.ktbdarija.com/old/

kh = ﺥ "ḫā" [x]

gh = ﻍ "ġayn" [ɣ]

sh = ش "šīn" [ʃ]

â = ﻉ "ʿayn" [ʔˤ]

h = ﺡ "ḥā" [ħ]

q = ﻕ "qāf" [q]

Long (aka "stable") vowels /a/, /i/, /u/ are written ''a, i, u''. ''e'' represents /ə/ and '''o''' represents /ŭ/ (see section on phonology, above). ''ă'' is used for /ă/ in speakers who still have this phoneme in the vicinity of pharyngeal {{IPA|/ʕ/}} and {{IPA|/ħ/}}.''ă'', ''ĭ'', and ''o'' are also used for ultrashort vowels used by educated speakers for the short vowels of some recent borrowings from MSA.

In practice, /ə/ is usually deleted when it is not the last vowel of a word. Some authors omit in transcription: ''ka-t-ktb-u'' "You are (plural) writing" instead of ''ka-t-ketb-u''. Others (like Richard Harrell, in his reference grammar of Moroccan Darija) maintain the ''e'', but it never occurs in an open syllable (one ending with a vowel). Instead, the ''e'' is transposed with the preceding (sometimes geminated) consonant, which ends up following ''e'', known as ''inversion''.

''y'' represents /j/.

''ḥ'' and ''ʿ'' represent pharyngeal {{IPA|/ħ/}} and {{IPA|/ʕ/}}.

''ġ'' and ''x'' represent velar {{IPA|/ɣ/}} and {{IPA|/x/}}.

''ṭ, ḍ, ṣ, ẓ, ṛ, ḷ'' represent emphatic {{IPA|/tˤ, dˤ, sˤ, zˤ, rˤ, lˤ/}}.

''š, ž'' represent hushing {{IPA|/ʃ, ʒ/}}.

== Grammar ==

=== Verbs ===

====Introduction====
The regular Moroccan verb conjugates with a series of prefixes and suffixes. The stem of the conjugated verb may change a bit, depending on the conjugation:

The stem of the Moroccan verb for "to write" is ''kteb''.

=====Past tense=====

The past tense of ''kteb'' (write) is as follows:

I wrote: ''kteb-t''

You wrote: ''kteb-ti'' (some regions tend to differentiate between masculine and feminine, the masculine form is ''kteb-t'', the feminine ''kteb-ti'')

He/it wrote: ''kteb'' (can also be an order to write; kteb er-rissala: Write the letter)

She/it wrote: ''ketb-et''

We wrote: ''kteb-na''

You (plural) wrote: ''kteb-tu'' / ''kteb-tiu

They wrote: ''ketb-u''

The stem ''kteb'' turns into ''ketb'' before a vowel suffix because of the process of ''inversion'' described above.

=====Present tense=====

The present tense of ''kteb'' is as follows:

I am writing: ''ka-ne-kteb''

You/ae (masculine) writing: ''ka-te-kteb''

You are (feminine) writing: ''ka-t-ketb-i''

He's/it is writing: ''ka-ye-kteb''

She is/it is writing: ''ka-te-kteb''

We are writing: ''ka-n-ketb-u''

You (plural) are writing: ''ka-t-ketb-u''

They are writing: ''ka-y-ketb-u''

The stem ''kteb'' turns into ''ketb'' before a vowel suffix because of the process of ''inversion'' described above. Between the prefix ''ka-n-, ka-t-, ka-y-'' and the stem ''kteb'', an ''e'' appears but not between the prefix and the transformed stem ''ketb'' because of the same restriction that produces inversion.

In the north, ''you are writing" is always ''ka-de-kteb'' regardless of who is addressed.
This is also the case of ''de'' in ''de-kteb'' as northerners prefer to use ''de'' and southerners prefer ''te''.

Instead of the prefix ''ka'', some speakers prefer the use of ''ta'' (''ta-ne-kteb'' "I am writing"). The coexistence of these two prefixes is from historic differences. In general, ''ka'' is more used in the north and ''ta'' in the south, some other prefixes like ''la'', ''a'', ''qa'' are less used. In some regions like in the east (Oujda), most speakers use no preverb (''ne-kteb'', ''te-kteb'', ''y-kteb'', etc.).

===== Other tenses =====

To form the future tense, the prefix ''ka-/ta-'' is removed and replaced with the prefix ''ġa-'', ''ġad-'' or ''ġadi'' instead (e.g. ''ġa-ne-kteb'' "I will write", ''ġad-ketb-u'' (north) or ''ġadi t-ketb-u'' "You (plural) will write").

For the subjunctive and infinitive, the ''ka-'' is removed (''bġit ne-kteb'' "I want to write", ''bġit te-kteb'' "I want 'you to write").

The imperative is conjugated with the suffixes of the present tense but without any prefixes or preverbs:

''kteb'' Write! (masculine singular)

''ketb-i'' Write! (feminine singular)

''ketb-u'' Write! (plural)

===== Negation =====
{{main|Negation in Arabic}}
One characteristic of Moroccan syntax, which it shares with other North African varieties as well as some southern Levantine dialect areas, is in the two-part negative verbal circumfix {{IPA|/ma-...-ʃi/}}. (In many regions, including Marrakech, the final {{IPA|/i/}} vowel is not pronounced so it becomes {{IPA|/ma-...-ʃ/}}.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boujenab|first=Abderrahmane|title=Moroccan Arabic|date=2011|publisher=Peace Corps Morocco|page=52|url=http://friendsofmorocco.org/learnarabic.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Past: {{IPA|/kteb/}} "he wrote" {{IPA|/ma-kteb-ʃi/}} "he did not write"
* Present: {{IPA|/ka-y-kteb/}} "he writes" {{IPA|/ma-ka-y-kteb-ʃi/}} "he does not write"

/ma-/ comes from the Classical Arabic negator /ma/. /-ʃi/ is a development of Classical /ʃayʔ/ "thing". The development of a circumfix is similar to the French circumfix ''ne ... pas'' in which ''ne'' comes from Latin ''non'' "not" and ''pas'' comes from Latin ''passus'' "step". (Originally, ''pas'' would have been used specifically with motion verbs, as in "I did not walk a step". It was generalised to other verbs.)

The negative circumfix surrounds the entire verbal composite, including direct and indirect object pronouns:

* {{IPA|/ma-kteb-hom-li-ʃi/}}  "he did not write them to me"
* {{IPA|/ma-ka-y-kteb-hom-li-ʃi/}}  "he does not write them to me"
* {{IPA|/ma-ɣadi-y-kteb-hom-li-ʃi/}}  "he will not write them to me"
* {{IPA|/waʃ ma-kteb-hom-li-ʃi/}}  "did he not write them to me?"
* {{IPA|/ waʃ ma-ka-y-kteb-hom-li-ʃi/}}  "does he not write them to me?"
* {{IPA|/waʃ ma-ɣadi-y-kteb-hom-li-ʃi/}}  "will he not write them to me?"

Future and interrogative sentences use the same {{IPA|/ma-...-ʃi/}} circumfix (unlike, for example, in Egyptian Arabic). Also, unlike in Egyptian Arabic, there are no phonological changes to the verbal cluster as a result of adding the circumfix. In Egyptian Arabic, adding the circumfix can trigger stress shifting, vowel lengthening and shortening, elision when /ma-/ comes into contact with a vowel, addition or deletion of a short vowel, etc. However, they do not ccur in Moroccan Darija (MA):
*There is no phonological stress in MA.
*There is no distinction between long and short vowels in MA.
*There are no restrictions on complex consonant clusters in MA and hence no need to insert vowels to break up such clusters.
*There are no verbal clusters that begin with a vowel. The short vowels in the beginning of Forms IIa(V), and such, have already been deleted. MA has first-person singular non-past /ne-/ in place of Egyptian /a-/.

Negative pronouns such as '''walu''' "nothing", '''ḥta ḥaja''' "nothing" and '''ḥta waḥed''' "nobody" can be added to the sentence without '''ši''' as a suffix:
*'''ma-ġa-ne-kteb walu''' "I will not write anything"
*'''ma-te-kteb ḥta ḥaja''' "Do not write anything"
*'''ḥta waḥed ma-ġa-ye-kteb''' "Nobody will write"
*'''wellah ma-ne-kteb''' ''or'' '''wellah ma-ġa-ne-kteb''' "I swear to God I will not write"

Note that '''wellah ma-ne-kteb''' could be a response to a command to write '''kteb''' while '''wellah ma-ġa-ne-kteb''' could be an answer to a question like '''waš ġa-te-kteb?''' "Are you going to write?"

In the north, "'you are writing" is always ''ka-de-kteb'' regardless of who is addressed. It is also the case of '''de''' in ''de-kteb'', as northerners prefer to use ''de'' and southerners prefer ''te''.

Instead of the prefix ''ka'', some speakers prefer the use of ''ta'' (''ta-ne-kteb'' "I am writing"). The co-existence of these two prefixes is from historical differences. In general ''ka'' is more used in the north and ''ta'' in the south. In some regions like the east (Oujda), most speakers ue no preverb:
*''ka ma-ġadi-ši-te-kteb?!''

====In detail====
Verbs in Moroccan are based on a [[consonantal root]] composed of three or four consonants.  The set of consonants communicates the basic meaning of a verb. Changes to the vowels between the consonants, along with prefixes and/or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as tense, person and number in addition to changes in the meaning of the verb that embody grammatical concepts such as [[causative]], [[intensive]], [[passive voice|passive]] or [[reflexive verb|reflexive]].

Each particular [[lexical verb]] is specified by two stems, one used for the past tense and one used for non-past tenses, along with [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[Imperative mood|imperative]] moods. To the former stem, suffixes are added to mark the verb for person, number and gender. To the latter stem, a combination of prefixes and suffixes are added. (Very approximately, the prefixes specify the person and the suffixes indicate number and gender.) The third person masculine singular past tense form serves as the "dictionary form" used to identify a verb like the [[infinitive]] in English. (Arabic has no infinitive.) For example, the verb meaning "write" is often specified as ''kteb'', which actually means "he wrote". In the paradigms below, a verb will be specified as ''kteb/ykteb'' (''kteb'' means "he wrote" and ''ykteb'' means "he writes"), indicating the past stem (''kteb-'') and the non-past stem (also ''-kteb-'', obtained by removing the prefix ''y-'').

The verb classes in Moroccan are formed along two axes. The first or ''derivational'' axis (described as "form I", "form II", etc.) is used to specify grammatical concepts such as [[causative]], [[intensive]], [[passive voice|passive]] or [[reflexive verb|reflexive]] and mostly involves varying the consonants of a stem form. For example, from the root K-T-B "write" are derived form I ''kteb/ykteb'' "write", form II ''ketteb/yketteb'' "cause to write", form III ''kateb/ykateb'' "correspond with (someone)" etc. The second or ''weakness'' axis (described as "strong", "weak", "hollow", "doubled" or "assimilated") is determined by the specific consonants making up the root, especially whether a particular consonant is a "w" or " y", and mostly involves varying the nature and location of the vowels of a stem form. For example, so-called ''weak'' verbs have one of those two letters as the last root consonant, which is reflected in the stem as a final vowel instead of a final consonant ('''ṛma/yṛmi''' "throw" from Ṛ-M-Y). Meanwhile, ''hollow'' verbs are usually caused by one of those two letters as the middle root consonant, and the stems of such verbs have a full vowel (/a/, /i/ or /u/) before the final consonant, often along with only two consonants (''žab/yžib'' "bring" from Ž-Y-B).

It is important to distinguish between strong, weak, etc. ''stems'' and strong, weak, etc. ''roots''. For example, X-W-F is a hollow ''root'', but the corresponding form II stem ''xuwwef/''yxuwwef'' "frighten" is a strong ''stem'':
*Weak roots are those that have a ''w'' or a ''y'' as the last consonant. Weak stems are those that have a vowel as the last segment of the stem. For the most part, there is a one-to-one correspondence between weak roots and weak stems. However, form IX verbs with a weak root will show up the same way as other root types (with doubled stems in most other dialects but with hollow stems in Moroccan Darija).
* Hollow roots are triliteral roots that have a''w'' or a ''y'' as the last consonant. Hollow stems are those that end with /-VC/ in which V is a long vowel (most other dialects) or full vowel in Moroccan (/a/, /i/ or /u/). Only triliteral hollow roots form hollow stems and only in forms I, IV, VII, VIII and X. In other cases, a strong stem generally results. In Moroccan Darija, all form IX verbs yield hollow stems regardless of root shape: ''sman'' "be fat" from S-M-N.
* Doubled roots are roots that have the final two consonants identical. Doubled stems end with a geminate consonant. Only Forms I, IV, VII, VIII, and X yield a doubled stem from a doubled root. Other forms yield a strong stem.  In addition, in most dialects (but not Moroccan), all stems in Form IX are doubled: Egyptian Arabic '''iḥmáṛṛ/yiḥmáṛṛ''' "be red, blush" from Ḥ-M-R.
* Assimilated roots are those where the first consonant is a ''w'' or a ''y''. Assimilated stems begin with a vowel. Only Form I (and Form IV?) yields assimilated stems and only in the non-past. There are none In Moroccan Darija.
* Strong roots and stems are those that fall under none of the other categories described above. It is common for a strong stem to correspond with a non-strong root but the reverse is rare.

===== Table of verb forms =====

In this section, all verb classes and their corresponding stems are listed, excluding the small number of irregular verbs described above. Verb roots are indicated schematically using capital letters to stand for consonants in the root:
*F = first consonant of root
*M = middle consonant of three-consonant root
*S = second consonant of four-consonant root
*T = third consonant of four-consonant root
*L = last consonant of root
Hence, the root F-M-L stands for all three-consonant roots, and F-S-T-L stands for all four-consonant roots. (Traditional Arabic grammar uses F-ʕ-L and F-ʕ-L-L, respectively, but the system used here appears in a number of grammars of spoken Arabic dialects and is probably less confusing for English speakers since the forms are easier to pronounce than those involving /ʕ/.)

The following table lists the prefixes and suffixes to be added to mark tense, person, number, gender and the stem form to which they are added. The forms involving a vowel-initial suffix and corresponding stem &lt;small&gt;PA&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;NP&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; are highlighted in silver. The forms involving a consonant-initial suffix and corresponding stem &lt;small&gt;PA&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; are highlighted in gold. The forms involving no suffix and corresponding stem &lt;small&gt;PA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; or &lt;small&gt;NP&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; are not highlighted.

The following table lists the verb classes along with the form of the past and non-past stems, active and passive participles, and verbal noun, in addition to an example verb for each class.

Notes:
*Italicized forms are those that follow automatically from the regular rules of deletion of /e/.
*In the past tense, there can be up to three stems:
**When only one form appears, this same form is used for all three stems.
**When three forms appear, these represent first-singular, third-singular and third-plural, which indicate the &lt;small&gt;PA&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;PA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;  and &lt;small&gt;PA&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; stems, respectively.
**When two forms appear, separated by a comma, these represent first-singular and third-singular, which indicate the &lt;small&gt;PA&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;PA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; stems.  When two forms appear, separated by a semicolon, these represent third-singular and third-plural, which indicate the &lt;small&gt;PA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;PA&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; stems.  In both cases, the missing stem is the same as the third-singular (&lt;small&gt;PA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;) stem.
*Not all forms have a separate verb class for hollow or doubled roots.  In such cases, the table below has the notation "(use strong form)", and roots of that shape appear as strong verbs in the corresponding form; e.g. Form II strong verb ''dˤáyyaʕ/yidˤáyyaʕ'' "waste, lose" related to Form I hollow verb ''dˤaʕ/yidˤiʕ'' "be lost", both from root Dˤ-Y-ʕ.

Some comments:
*Boldface, here and elsewhere in paradigms, indicate unexpected deviations from some previously established pattern.
*The present indicative is formed from the subjunctive by the addition of /ka-/.  Similarly, the future is formed from the subjunctive by the addition of /ɣa-/.
*The imperative is also formed from the second-person subjunctive, this by the ''removal'' of any prefix /t-/, /te-/,  or /d-/.
*The stem /kteb/ changes to /ketb-/ before a vowel.
*Prefixes /ne-/ and /te-/ keep the vowel before two consonants but drop it before one consonant; hence singular /ne-kteb/ changes to plural /n-ketb-u/.

This paradigm differs from '''kteb/ykteb''' in the following ways:
*/ne-/ is always reduced to /n-/.
*/te-/ is always reduced to /t-/, and then all /t-/ are assimilated to /d-/.
Reduction and assimilation occur as follows:
*Before a coronal stop /t/, /tˤ/, /d/ or /dˤ/, /ne-/ and /te-/ are always reduced to /n-/ and /t-/.
*Before a coronal fricative /s/, /sˤ/, /z/, /zˤ/, /ʃ/ or /ʒ/, /ne-/ and /te-/ are ''optionally'' reduced to /n-/ and /t-/.  The reduction usually happens in normal and fast speech but not in slow speech.
*Before a voiced coronal /d/, /dˤ/, /z/, /zˤ/,  or /ʒ/, /t-/ is assimilated to /d-/.
Examples:
*Required reduction /n-them/ "I accuse", /t-them/ "''you'' accuse".
*Optional reduction /n-skon/ or /ne-skon/ "I reside", /te-skon/ or /t-skon/ "''you'' reside".
*Optional reduction/assimilation /te-ʒberˤ/ or /d-ʒberˤ/ "''you'' find".

Boldfaced forms indicate the primary differences from the corresponding forms of '''kteb''', which apply to many classes of verbs in addition to form II strong:
*The prefixes /t-/, /n-/ always appear without any stem vowel.  This behavior is seen in all classes where the stem begins with a single consonant (which includes most classes).
*The /e/ in the final vowel of the stem is elided when a vowel-initial suffix is added.  This behavior is seen in all classes where the stem ends in /-VCeC/ or/-VCCeC/ (where /V/ stands for any vowel and /C/ for any consonant).  In addition to form II strong, this includes form III strong, form III Due to the regular operation of the stress rules, the stress in the past tense forms '''''beddel-et''''' and '''''beddel-u''''' differs from '''''dexl-et''''' and '''''dexl-u'''''.

The primary differences from the corresponding forms of '''beddel''' (shown in boldface) are:
*The long vowel /a/ becomes /a/ when unstressed.
*The /i/ in the stem /safir/ is elided when a suffix beginning with a vowel follows.

The primary differences from the corresponding forms of '''kteb''' (shown in ) are:
*There is no  movement of the sort occurring in '''kteb''' vs. '''ketb-'''.
*Instead, in the past, there are two stems: '''nsi-''' in the first and second persons and '''nsa-''' in the third person.  In the non-past, there is a single stem '''nsa'''.
*Because the stems end in a vowel, normally vocalic suffixes assume consonantal form:
**Plural '''-u''' becomes '''-w'''.
**Feminine singular non-past '''-i''' becomes '''-y'''.
**Feminine singular third-person past '''-et''' becomes '''-t'''.

This verb type is quite similar to the weak verb type '''nsa/ynsa'''.  The primary differences are:
*The non-past stem has /i/ instead of /a/.  The occurrence of one vowel or the other varies from stem to stem in an unpredictable fashion.
*'''-iy''' in the feminine singular non-past is simplified to '''-i''', resulting in homonymy between masculine and feminine singular.
Verbs other than form I behave as follows in the non-past:
* Form X has either /a/ or /i/.
* Mediopassive verb forms—i.e. Ia(VIIt), IIa(V), IIIa(VI) and Iqa(IIq) – have /a/.
* Other forms—i.e. II, III and Iq—have /i/.
Examples:
* Form II: '''wedda/yweddi''' "fulfill"; '''qewwa/yqewwi''' "strengthen"
* Form III: '''qadˤa/yqadˤi''' "finish"; '''dawa/ydawi''' "treat, cure"
* Form Ia(VIIt): '''ttensa/yttensa''' "be forgotten"
* Form IIa(V): '''tqewwa/ytqewwa''' "become strong"
* Form IIIa(VI): '''tqadˤa/ytqadˤa''' "end (intrans.)"
* Form VIII: (no examples?)
*Form IX: (behaves as a strong verb)
* Form X: '''stedʕa/ystedʕi''' "invite"; but '''stehza/ystehza''' "ridicule", '''steħla/ysteħla''' "enjoy", '''steħya/ysteħya''' "become embarrassed", '''stăʕfa/ystăʕfa''' "resign"
* Form Iq: (need example)
* Form Iqa(IIq): (need example)

===== Sample Paradigms of Hollow Verbs =====

Hollow have a W or Y as the middle root consonant.  Note that for some forms (e.g. form II and form III), hollow verbs are conjugated as strong verbs (e.g. form II ''ʕeyyen/yʕeyyen'' "appoint" from ʕ-Y-N, form III ''ʒaweb/yʒaweb'' "answer" from ʒ-W-B).

This verb works much like '''beddel/ybeddel''' "teach".  Like all verbs whose stem begins with a single consonant, the prefixes differ in the following way from those of regular and weak form I verbs:
*The prefixes /t-/, /y-/, /ni-/ have elision of /i/ following /ka-/ or /ɣa-/.
*The imperative prefix /i-/ is missing.

In addition, the past tense has two stems: '''beʕ-''' before consonant-initial suffixes (first and second person) and '''baʕ-''' elsewhere (third person).

This verb works much like '''baʕ/ybiʕ''' "sell".  Like that class, it has two stems in the past, which are '''ħebbi-''' before consonant-initial suffixes (first and second person) and '''ħebb-''' elsewhere (third person).  Note that /i-/ was borrowed from the weak verbs; the Classical Arabic equivalent form would be *'''ħabáb-''', e.g. *'''ħabáb-t'''.

Some verbs have /o/ in the stem: '''koħħ/ykoħħ''' "cough".

As for the other forms:
*Form II, V doubled verbs are strong: '''ɣedded/yɣedded''' "limit, fix (appointment)"
*Form III, VI doubled verbs optionally behave either as strong verbs or similar to '''ħebb/yħebb''': '''sˤafef/ysˤafef''' or '''sˤaff/ysˤaff''' "line up (trans.)"
*Form VIIt doubled verbs behave like '''ħebb/yħebb''': '''ttʕedd/yttʕedd'''
*Form VIII doubled verbs behave like '''ħebb/yħebb''': '''htemm/yhtemm''' "be interested (in)"
*Form IX doubled verbs probably don't exist, and would be strong if they did exist.
*Form X verbs behave like '''ħebb/yħebb''': '''stɣell/ystɣell''' "exploit".

===== Sample Paradigms of Doubly Weak Verbs =====

"Doubly weak" verbs have more than one "weakness", typically a W or Y as both the second and third consonants.  This term is in fact a misnomer, as such verbs actually behave as normal weak verbs (e.g. '''ħya/yħya''' "live" from Ħ-Y-Y, '''quwwa/yquwwi''' "strengthen" from Q-W-Y, '''dawa/ydawi''' "treat, cure" from D-W-Y).

===== Paradigms of Irregular Verbs =====

The irregular verbs are as follows:

*'''dda/yddi''' "give" (inflects like a normal weak verb; active participle '''dday''' or '''meddi''', passive participle '''meddi''')
*'''ʒa/yʒi''' "come" (inflects like a normal weak verb, except imperative '''aʒi''' (sg.), '''aʒiw''' (pl.); active participle '''maʒi''' or '''ʒay''')
*'''kla/yakol''' (or '''kal/yakol''') "eat" and '''xda/yaxod''' (or '''xad/yaxod''') "take" (see paradigm below; active participle '''wakel, waxed'''; passive participle '''muwkul, muwxud'''):

[[File:Interview with Salma Rachid by Lalamoulati - Dec 12, 2017.webm|thumb|An interview with [[Salma Rachid]], a Moroccan singer while she speaks Moroccan Arabic.]]
=== Evolution ===
In general, Moroccan language is one of the most innovative (in the technical sense of "least conservative") of all Arabic languages. Now, Moroccan language or Darija continues to integrate new French words, mainly [[technology|technological]] and modern words. However, in recent years, constant exposure to revived classical forms on television and in print media and a certain desire among many Moroccans for a revitalization of an [[Arab]] identity has inspired many Moroccans to integrate words from Modern Standard Arabic, replacing their French or Spanish counterparts or even speaking in Modern Standard Arabic while keeping the Moroccan [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] to sound less pedantic. The phenomenon mostly occurs among literate people.

Though rarely written, Moroccan language is currently undergoing an unexpected and pragmatic revival. It is now the preferred language in Moroccan [[chat rooms]] or for sending [[SMS]], using [[Arabic Chat Alphabet]] composed of Latin letters supplemented with the numbers ''2'', ''3'', ''5'', ''7'' and ''9'' for coding specific Arabic sounds, as is the case with other Arabic speakers.

The language continues to evolve quickly as can be noted by consulting the Colin dictionary. Many words and idiomatic expressions recorded between 1921 and 1977 are now obsolete.

===Code switching===
Some Moroccan speakers, in the territory previously known as [[French Morocco]], also practice [[code-switching]]. In the northern parts of Morocco, as in Tetouan &amp; [[Tangier]], it is common for code-switching to occur between Moroccan Arabic, [[Modern Standard Arabic]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], as [[Spain]] had [[Spanish Morocco|previously controlled part of the region]] and continues to possess the territories of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] in North Africa bordering only Morocco. On the other hand, some [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] Moroccans generally attempt to avoid French and Spanish in their speech, consequently, their speech tends to resemble old [[Andalusian Arabic]].

=== Artistic expression ===
There exists some poetry written in Moroccan language like the [[Malhun]]. In the troubled and autocratic Morocco of the 1970s, [[Years of Lead (Morocco)|Years of Lead]], the legendary [[Nass El Ghiwane]] band wrote beautiful and allusive lyrics in Moroccan that were very appealing to the youth even in other [[Maghreb]] countries.

Another interesting movement is the development of an original [[hip hop music|rap music]] scene, which explores new and innovative usages of the language.

=== Scientific production ===
The first known scientific productions written in Moroccan were released on the Web in early 2010 by Moroccan teacher and physician Farouk Taki El Merrakchi, three average-sized books dealing with physics and mathematics [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7GQg9R-g5q2UlFhZlIzU3hBeWM/edit?pli=1#sthash.QAZ4ABMl.dpuf (Example here)].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medias24.com/SOCIETE/6642-Une-premiere-Un-Marocain-redige-des-manuels-scientifiques-en-darija.html|title=Une première: Un Marocain rédige des manuels scientifiques en…|website=Medias24.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspapers===
There are now at least three [[newspaper]]s{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} in Moroccan language; their aim is to bring information to people with a low level of [[education]]. From September 2006 to October 2010, ''[[Telquel (Morocco)|Telquel]]'' Magazine had a Moroccan language edition [[Nichane]]. There is also a free weekly magazine that is entirely written in "standard" Moroccan language: ''Khbar Bladna'' ('News of Our Country').

The Moroccan online newspaper ''Goud'' or "گود" has much of its content written in Moroccan Darija rather than Modern Standard Arabic. Its name "Goud" and its slogan "dima nishan" (ديما نيشان) are Moroccan Darija expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goud.ma|website=Goud|title=كود}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venkata Mahalingam''' (15 August 1900 – 4 December 1976), who wrote under the name of '''N. Pichamoorthi''', was an Indian poet and writer. He is considered father of free verse (Puthu Kavidai) in [[Tamil language|Tamil]].&lt;ref name=Hindu&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/2000/08/14/stories/13140675.htm| title=The writer's writer| work=The Hindu | date= 14 August 2000 | accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote more than 127 short stories, 11 stage plays and a couple of novels. He was a lawyer by profession and also worked as editor in magazines.&lt;ref name=Hindu /&gt;

==Biography==
N. Pichamoorthi was born in [[Kumbakonam]] to Natesa [[Dikshitar]] and Lakshmi ammal as Vankata Mahalingam on 15 August 1900. He was the fourth child and the only child to survive as the first three children died during infancy. His parents being deeply religious named him "Pichai" Begger as they believed the death god would spare him as this name is very ugly. As the days went by, his name turned to Pichamoorthi. In 1925, Pichamoorthi married Saratha. Between 1924 and 1938 he practised as a lawyer in the Lower court of Kumbakonam. He also worked as Editor and Subeditor of several magazines during his life time. He was considered the father of free verse in Tamil (Puthu Kavithai); he was inspired by [[Subramania Bharati]] who was contributing to free verse kind of poetry. Pichamoorthi's works was inspired by literature and poetry works from the West where free verse poetry was already in existence. Pichamoorthi also wrote short stories with simple themes based on social happenings which had deep philosophical meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geotamil.com/pathivukalnew/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=200:q-q&amp;catid=2:2011-02-25-12-52-49&amp;Itemid=19| title="தமிழ்ப் புதுக்கவிதையின் தந்தை"| work= geotamil.com | date= 3 June 2011 | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Occitan''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|ɒ|k|s|ᵻ|t|ən|,_|-|t|æ|n|,_|-|t|ɑː|n}};&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Occitan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2005 |encyclopedia=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-oc|utsiˈta|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;Regional pronunciations: ''occitan'' = {{IPA|[u(t)siˈtaⁿ, u(t)siˈtɔ, ukʃiˈtɔ]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|ɔksitɑ̃|lang}}), also known as '''''lenga d'òc''''' ({{IPA-oc|ˈleŋɡɔ ˈðɔ(k)|lang|Oc-Lenga_d'òc.ogg}}; {{lang-fr|langue d'oc}}) by its native speakers, is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]]. It is spoken in [[southern France]], [[Italy]]'s [[Occitan Valleys]], [[Monaco]], and [[Spain]]'s [[Val d'Aran]]; collectively, these regions are sometimes referred to as [[Occitania]]. Occitan is also spoken in the linguistic enclave of [[Guardia Piemontese]] ([[Calabria]], Italy). However, there is controversy about the unity of the language, as some think that Occitan is a [[wikt:macrolanguage|macrolanguage]]. Others include [[Catalan language|Catalan]] in this family, as the [[Linguistic distance|distance]] between this language and some Occitan dialects (such as the [[Gascon language]]) is similar to the distance among different Occitan dialects. In fact, Catalan was considered an Occitan dialect until the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friend|first1=Julius W.|title=Stateless Nations: Western European Regional Nationalisms and the Old Nations|date=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0-230-36179-X|page=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-SF4-ip95MoC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Occitan is an official language in [[Catalonia]], where a subdialect of Gascon known as [[Aranese dialect|Aranese]] is spoken in the [[Val d'Aran]].&lt;ref&gt;As stated in its [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia|Statute of Autonomy]] approved. See Article 6.5 in the [http://www.parlament-cat.net/porteso/estatut/estatut_angles_100506.pdf Parlament-cat.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826045656/http://www.parlament-cat.net/porteso/estatut/estatut_angles_100506.pdf |date=26 August 2013 }}, text of the 2006 Statute of Catalonia (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Occitan's closest relative is [[Catalan language|Catalan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Bergin|1984|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 2010, the [[Parliament of Catalonia]] has considered Aranese Occitan to be the officially preferred language for use in the Val d'Aran.

Across history, the terms [[Limousin dialect|Limousin]] (''Lemosin''), [[Languedocien dialect|Languedocien]] (''Lengadocian''), [[Gascon dialect|Gascon]], and later [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] (''Provençal'', ''Provençau'' or ''Prouvençau'') have been used as synonyms for the whole of Occitan; nowadays, "Provençal" is understood mainly as the Occitan dialect spoken in [[Provence]], in southeast France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dalby |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Dalby |title=Dictionary of Languages |url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/ |accessdate=8 November 2006 |edition=1st |year=1998 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing plc |isbn=0-7475-3117-X |page=468 |chapter=Occitan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other Romance languages such as French or [[Spanish language|Spanish]], there is no single written standard language called "Occitan", and Occitan has no official status in France, home to most of Occitania. Instead, there are competing norms for writing Occitan, some of which attempt to be pan-dialectal, whereas others are based on particular dialects. These efforts are hindered by the rapidly declining use of Occitan as a spoken language in much of southern France, as well as by the significant differences in phonology and vocabulary among different Occitan dialects.

In particular, the northern and easternmost dialects have more morphological and phonetic features in common with the [[Northern Italian languages|Gallo-Italic]] and [[Oïl languages]] (e.g. [[nasal vowel]]s; loss of final consonants; initial ''cha/ja-'' instead of ''ca/ga-''; [[uvular R|uvular {{angbr|r}}]]; the front-rounded sound {{IPA|/ø/}} instead of a diphthong, {{IPA|/w/}} instead of {{IPA|/l/}} before a consonant), whereas the southernmost dialects have more features in common with the [[Ibero-Romance languages]] (e.g. [[betacism]]; voiced fricatives between vowels in place of voiced stops; -''ch''- in place of -''it''-), and Gascon has a number of unusual features not seen in other dialects (e.g. {{IPA|/h/}} in place of {{IPA|/f/}}; loss of {{IPA|/n/}} between vowels; intervocalic ''-r-'' and final ''-t/ch'' in place of medieval -{{sm|ll}}-). There are also significant lexical differences, where some dialects have words cognate with French, and others have Catalan and Spanish cognates (''maison''/''casa'' "house", ''testa''/''cap'' "head", ''petit''/''pichon'' "small", ''achaptar''/''crompar'' "to buy", ''entendre''/''ausir'' "to hear", ''se taire''/''se calar'' "to be quiet", ''tombar''/''caire'' "to fall", ''p(l)us''/''mai'' "more", ''totjorn''/''sempre'' "always", etc.). Nonetheless, there is a significant amount of [[mutual intelligibility]].

The long-term survival of Occitan is in grave doubt. According to the [[UNESCO]] [[Red Book of Endangered Languages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; four of the six major dialects of Occitan (Provençal, [[Auvergnat dialect|Auvergnat]], Limousin and Languedocien) are considered [[Endangered language#Defining and measuring endangerment|severely endangered]], whereas the remaining two ([[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Vivaro-Alpine dialect|Vivaro-Alpine]]) are considered [[Endangered language#Defining and measuring endangerment|definitely endangered]].

==Name==

===History of the modern term===
[[File:Carta Occitania.pdf|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Main cities of Occitania, written in the Occitan language]]
The name Occitan comes from ''lenga d'òc'' ("language of òc"), ''òc'' being the Occitan word for ''yes.'' While the term would have been in use orally for some time after the decline of Latin, as far as historical records show, the Italian medieval poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] was the first to have recorded the term ''lingua d'oc'' in writing. In his ''[[De vulgari eloquentia]]'', he wrote in Latin, ''"nam alii oc, alii si, alii vero dicunt oil"'' ("for some say ''òc'', others ''sì'', yet others say ''oïl''"), thereby highlighting three major [[Romance languages|Romance literary languages]] that were well known in Italy, based on each language's word for "yes", the ''òc language'' (Occitan), the ''oïl language'' (French), and the ''sì language'' (Sicilian and Italian). This was not, of course, the only defining characteristic of each group.

The word ''òc'' came from [[Vulgar Latin]] ''hoc'' ("this"), while ''oïl'' originated from Latin ''hoc illud'' ("this [is] it"). [[Old Catalan]], and now the Catalan of Northern Catalonia also have ''hoc'' (''òc''). Other Romance languages derive their word for "yes" from the Latin ''sic,'' "thus [it is], [it was done], etc.", such as Spanish ''sí'', [[Eastern Lombard dialect|Eastern Lombard]] ''sé'', Sicilian and Italian ''sì'', or Portuguese ''sim''. In Modern Catalan, as in modern Spanish, ''sí'' is usually used as a response, although the language retains the word ''oi'', akin to ''òc'', which is sometimes used at the end of [[yes–no question]]s, and also in higher register as a positive response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Antoni M.|last=Badia i Margarit|title=Gramàtica de la llengua catalana: Descriptiva, normativa, diatòpica, diastràtica|publisher=Proa|location=Barcelona|year=1995}}, 253.1 {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; French uses ''si'' to answer "yes" in response to questions that are asked in the negative sense: e.g., ''"Vous n'avez pas de frères?"'' ''"Si, j'en ai sept."'' ("You have no brothers?" "Yes [I do], I have seven.").

The name "Occitan" was attested around 1300 as ''occitanus'', a crossing of ''oc'' and ''aquitanus'' ([[Aquitania]]n).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Bergin|1984|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other names for Occitan===
For many centuries, the Occitan dialects (together with [[Catalan language|Catalan]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapobladelduc.org/valencia/nom.htm Lapobladelduc.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806200731/http://www.lapobladelduc.org/valencia/nom.htm |date=6 August 2007 }}, "El nom de la llengua". ''The name of the language'', in Catalan&lt;/ref&gt; were referred to as ''Limousin'' or ''Provençal'', after the names of two regions lying within the modern Occitan-speaking area. After [[Frédéric Mistral]]'s [[Félibrige]] movement in the 19th century, Provençal achieved the greatest literary recognition and so became the most popular term for Occitan.

According to [[Joseph Anglade]], a [[philology|philologist]] and specialist of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] literature who helped impose the then [[archaism|archaic]] term ''Occitan'' as the sole correct name,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anglade|1921|p=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k255748j/f46.image 10]}}: ''Sur ''Occitania'' ont été formés les adjectifs latins ''occitanus'', ''occitanicus'' et les adjectifs français ''occitanique'', ''occitanien'', ''occitan'' (ce dernier terme plus récent), qui seraient excellents et qui ne prêteraient pas à la même confusion que ''provençal''.''&lt;/ref&gt; the word ''Lemosin'' was first used to designate the language at the beginning of the 13th century by [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[troubadour]] [[Raimon Vidal de Bezaudun|Raimon Vidal de Besalú(n)]] in his ''Razós de trobar'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''La parladura Francesca val mais et [es] plus avinenz a far romanz e pasturellas; mas cella de Lemozin val mais per far vers et cansons et serventés; et per totas las terras de nostre lengage son de major autoritat li cantar de la lenga Lemosina que de negun'autra parladura, per qu'ieu vos en parlarai primeramen.''{{sfn|Anglade|1921|p=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k255748j/f43.image 7]}}

The French language is worthier and better suited for romances and [[pastourelle]]s; but that (language) from [[History of Limousin|Limousin]] is of greater value for writing poems and [[canso (song)|cançons]] and [[sirventes|sirventés]]; and across the whole of the lands where our tongue is spoken, the literature in the Limousin language has more authority than any other dialect, wherefore I shall use this name in priority.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As for the word ''Provençal'', it should not be taken as strictly meaning the language of [[Provence]], but of [[Occitania]] as a whole, for "in the eleventh, the twelfth, and sometimes also the thirteenth centuries, one would understand under the name of Provence the whole territory of the old [[Gallia Narbonensis|Provincia Romana]] and even [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitaine]]".&lt;ref&gt;Camille Chabaneau et al, ''Histoire générale de Languedoc'', 1872, p. 170: ''Au onzième, douzième et encore parfois au XIIIe siècle, on comprenait sous le nom de Provence tout le territoire de l'ancienne Provincia Romana et même de l'Aquitaine.''&lt;/ref&gt; The term first came into fashion in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anglade|1921|p=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k255748j/f43.image 7]}}: ''Ce terme fut surtout employé en Italie''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, [[linguist]]s use the terms "Provençal" and "Limousin" strictly to refer to specific varieties within Occitania, keeping the name "Occitan" for the language as a whole. Many non-specialists, however, continue to refer to the language as Provençal, causing some confusion.

One of the oldest written fragments of the language found dates back to 960, in an official text that was mixed with Latin:&lt;blockquote&gt;De ista hora in antea non DECEBRÀ Ermengaus filius Eldiarda Froterio episcopo filio Girberga NE Raimundo filio Bernardo vicecomite de castello de Cornone... NO·L LI TOLRÀ NO·L LI DEVEDARÀ NI NO L'EN DECEBRÀ... nec societatem non AURÀ, si per castellum recuperare NON O FA, et si recuperare potuerit in potestate Froterio et Raimundo LO TORNARÀ, per ipsas horas quæ Froterius et Raimundus L'EN COMONRÀ.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Raynouard | first=François Juste Marie  | authorlink=François Juste Marie Raynouard | year=1817 | title=Choix des poésies originales des troubadours (Volume 2) | publisher= F.

Other famous pieces include the ''[[Boecis]]'', a 258-line-long poem written entirely in the Limousin dialect of Occitan between the year 1000 and 1030 and inspired by [[Boethius]]'s ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]''; the [[Waldensians|Waldensian]] ''[[La nobla leyczon]]'' (dated 1100),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Raynouard | first=François Juste Marie  | year=1817 | title=Choix des poésies originales des troubadours (Volume 2) | publisher= F. Didot | place=Paris | page= cxxxvij | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5784124w/f150.image | language=French}}: "Ben ha mil e cent (1100) ancs complí entierament / Que fo scripta l'ora car sen al derier temps."&lt;/ref&gt; ''la [[Cançó de Santa Fe]]'' (c. 1054–1076), the ''[[Romance of Flamenca]]'' (13th century), the ''[[Song of the Albigensian Crusade]]'' (1213–1219?), ''[[Daurel e Betó]]'' (12th or 13th century), ''[[Las, qu'i non sun sparvir, astur]]'' (11th century) and ''[[Tomida femina]]'' (9th or 10th century).

Occitan was the vehicle for the influential [[poetry]] of the medieval [[troubadours]] (''trovadores'') and ''[[trobairitz]]'': At that time, the language was understood and celebrated throughout most of educated Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Knight, ''Penny Cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge'', Vol. XXV, 1843, p. 308: "At one time the language and poetry of the troubadours were in fashion in most of the courts of Europe."&lt;/ref&gt; It was the maternal language of the English queen [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and kings [[Richard I of England]] (who wrote troubadour poetry) and [[John, King of England]]. With the gradual imposition of French royal power over its territory, Occitan declined in status from the 14th century on. By the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]] (1539) it was decreed that the ''[[langue d'oïl]]'' (French - though at the time referring to the [[Francien language]] and not the larger collection of dialects grouped under the name [[Langues d'oïl]]) should be used for all French administration. Occitan's greatest decline was during the [[French Revolution]], during which diversity of language was considered a threat.

In 1903 the four Gospels Lis Evangèli i.e. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were translated into the form of Provençal spoken in Cannes and Grasse.  This was given the official Roman Catholic Imprimatur by A. Estellon, vicar general.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The literary renaissance of the late 19th century (which included a Nobel Prize for Frédéric Mistral) was attenuated by [[World War I]], when Occitan speakers spent extended periods of time alongside French-speaking comrades.

===Origins===
[[File:Linguistic map Southwestern Europe.gif|thumb|right|upright=1.35]]
Because the geographical territory in which Occitan is spoken is surrounded by regions in which other [[Romance languages]] are used, external influences could have influenced its origin and development. Many factors favoured its development as a language of its own.

* Mountains and seas: The range of Occitan is bounded naturally by the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Massif Central]], the [[Pyrenees]], and the [[Alps]].
* Buffer zones: [[Arid]] land, [[marsh]]es, and areas otherwise impractical for farming and resistant of colonization provide further separation (territory between [[Loire]] and [[Garonne]], the [[Aragon]] desert plateau).
* Constant populations: Some Occitan-speaking peoples are descended from people living in the region since prehistory{{sfn|Bec|1963}}
* Little [[Celts|Celtic]] influence{{sfn|Bec|1963}}
* Ancient and long-term Roman influence: [[Julius Caesar]] once said that the people of [[Aquitaine]] could teach the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] themselves to speak Latin more correctly. According to Müller, "France's linguistic separation began with Roman influence"{{sfn|Bec|1963|pp=20-21}}
* A separate [[lexicon]]: Although Occitan is midway between the [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]] and [[Iberian Romance languages]], it has "around 550 words inherited from Latin that do not exist in the [[langues d'oïl]] or in [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]]"{{sfn|Bec|1963|pp=20-21}}
* Little germanization: "The [[Frankish language|Frankish]] lexicon and its phonetic influence often end above the oc/oïl line"{{sfn|Bec|1963|pp=20–21}}

===Occitan in the Iberian Peninsula===
Catalan in Spain's northern and central Mediterranean coastal regions and the [[Balearic Islands]] is closely related to Occitan, sharing many linguistic features and a common origin (see [[Occitano-Romance languages]]). The language was one of the first to gain prestige as a medium for literature among Romance languages in the Middle Ages. Indeed, in the 12th and 13th centuries, Catalan troubadours such as Guerau de Cabrera, Guilhem de Bergadan, Guilhem de Cabestany, Huguet de Mataplana, Raimon Vidal de Besalú, Cerverí de Girona, Formit de Perpinhan, and Jofre de Foixà wrote in Occitan.

At the end of the 11th century, the ''[[Franks]]'', as they were called at the time, started to penetrate the [[Iberian Peninsula]] through the [[Way of St. James|Ways of St. James]] via [[Somport]] and [[Roncesvalles]], settling on various spots of the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] enticed by the privileges granted them by the [[List of Navarrese monarchs|Navarrese kings]]. They established themselves in ethnic [[borough]]s where Occitan was used for everyday life, e.g. Pamplona, [[Sangüesa]], [[Estella-Lizarra]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cierbide Martinena | first1 = Ricardo | author1-link = | title = Convivencia histórica de lenguas y culturas en Navarra | journal = Caplletra: Revista Internacional de Filología | volume = | issue = 20 | page = 247 | publisher = València (etc) : Institut Interuniversitari de Filologia Valenciana; Abadia de Montserrat | location = | date = | year = 1996 | url = http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2274080 | issn = 0214-8188}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language in turn became the status language chosen by the Navarrese kings, nobility, and upper classes for official and trade purposes in the period stretching from the early 13th century to late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cierbide Martinena | first1 = Ricardo | author1-link = | title = Notas gráfico-fonéticas sobre la documentación medieval navarra | journal = Príncipe de Viana | volume = | issue = 214 | page = 524 | publisher = | location = | date = | year = 1998 | url = http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=16134 | issn = 0032-8472}}&lt;/ref&gt; These boroughs in Navarre may have been close-knit communities with little mingling, in a context where the natural milieu was predominantly [[Basque language|Basque]]-speaking. The variant chosen for written administrative records was a ''[[koiné language|koiné]]'' based on the Languedocien dialect from Toulouse with fairly archaic linguistic features.

Evidence of a written account in Occitan from Pamplona revolving around the burning of borough San Nicolas from 1258 survives today, while the ''History of the War of Navarre'' by Guilhem Anelier (1276) albeit written in Pamplona shows a linguistic variant from [[History of Toulouse#13th to 14th century|Toulouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cierbide Martinena | first1 = Ricardo | author1-link = | title = Convivencia histórica de lenguas y culturas en Navarra | journal = Caplletra: Revista Internacional de Filología | volume = | issue = 20 | pages = 247–249 | publisher = València (etc) : Institut Interuniversitari de Filologia Valenciana; Abadia de Montserrat | location = | date = | year = 1996 | url = http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2274080 | issn = 0214-8188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Things turned out slightly otherwise in Aragon, where the sociolinguistic situation was different, with a clearer Basque-Romance bilingual situation (cf. Basques from the Val d'Aran cited c. 1000), but a receding Basque language (Basque banned in the marketplace of Huesca, 1349).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Jurio, Jimeno | year = 1997 | title = ''Navarra: Historia del Euskera'' | publisher = Txalaparta | location= Tafalla | isbn = 978-84-8136-062-2 | pages = 59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/118353 | title = Licenciado Andrés de Poza y Yarza | publisher = EuskoMedia Fundazioa | accessdate = 17 February 2010}} ''Poza quotes the Basques inhabiting lands as far east as the River Gallego in the 16th century&lt;/ref&gt; While the language was chosen as a medium of prestige in records and official statements along with Latin in the early 13th century, Occitan faced competition from the rising local Romance vernacular, the [[Navarro-Aragonese]], both orally and in writing, especially after Aragon's territorial conquests south to [[Zaragoza]], [[Huesca]] and [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]] between 1118 and 1134. It resulted that a second Occitan immigration of this period was assimilated by the similar [[Navarro-Aragonese|Navarro-Aragonese language]], which at the same time was fostered and chosen by the kings of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]]. The language fell into decay in the 14th century across the whole southern Pyrenean area and became largely absorbed into [[Navarro-Aragonese]] first and [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]] later in the 15th century, after their exclusive boroughs broke up (1423, [[Pamplona#Three boroughs and one city|Pamplona]]'s boroughs unified).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cierbide Martinena | first1 = Ricardo | author1-link = | title = Convivencia histórica de lenguas y culturas en Navarra | journal = Caplletra: Revista Internacional de Filología | volume = | issue = 20 | page = 249 | publisher = València (etc) : Institut Interuniversitari de Filologia Valenciana; Abadia de Montserrat | location = | date = | year = 1996 | url = http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2274080 | issn = 0214-8188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gascon-speaking communities were called in for trading purposes by Navarrese kings in the early 12th century to the coastal fringe extending from [[San Sebastián|San Sebastian]] to the [[Bidasoa River]], where they settled down. The language variant used was different from the ones used in Navarre, i.e. a [[Béarnese dialect]] of Gascon,&lt;ref name="dialnet.unirioja.es"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cierbide Martinena | first1 = Ricardo | author1-link = | title = Convivencia histórica de lenguas y culturas en Navarra | journal = Caplletra: Revista Internacional de Filología | volume = | issue = 20 | page = 248 | publisher = València (etc) : Institut Interuniversitari de Filologia Valenciana; Abadia de Montserrat | location = | date = | year = 1996 | url = http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2274080 | issn = 0214-8188}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Gascon being in use far longer than in Navarre and Aragon until the 19th century, thanks mainly to the close ties held by Donostia and [[Pasaia]] with [[Bayonne]].

==Geographic distribution==

===Usage in France===
[[File:SpeakFrenchBeClean.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|"Speak French, Be Clean" written across the wall of a Southern French school]]
[[File:Occitan and French language signs in Toulouse.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|This bilingual street sign in [[Toulouse]], like many such signs found in historical parts of the city, is maintained primarily for its antique charm; it is typical of what little remains of the ''lenga d'òc'' in southern French cities.]]

Though it was still an everyday language for most of the rural population of southern France well into the 20th century, it is now spoken by about 100,000 people in France according to 2012 estimates.&lt;ref name="bernissan"/&gt;

According to the 1999 census, there were 610,000 native speakers (almost all of whom are also native French speakers) and perhaps another million persons with some exposure to the language. Following the pattern of [[language shift]], most of this remainder is to be found among the eldest populations. Occitan activists (called ''Occitanists'') have attempted, in particular with the advent of Occitan-language preschools (the ''[[Calandreta]]s''), to reintroduce the language to the young.

Nonetheless, the number of proficient speakers of Occitan is dropping precipitously. A tourist in the cities in southern France is unlikely to hear a single Occitan word spoken on the street (or, for that matter, in a home), and is likely to only find the occasional vestige, such as street signs (and, of those, most will have French equivalents more prominently displayed), to remind them of the traditional language of the area.

Occitans, as a result of more than 200 years of conditioned suppression and humiliation (see [[Vergonha]]), seldom speak their own language in the presence of foreigners, whether they are from abroad or from outside Occitania (in this case, often merely and abusively referred to as ''Parisiens'' or ''Nordistes'', which means ''northerners''). Occitan is still spoken by many elderly people in rural areas, but they generally switch to French when dealing with outsiders.

Occitan's decline is somewhat less pronounced in [[Béarn]] because of the province's history (a late addition to the Kingdom of France), though even there the language is little spoken outside the homes of the rural elderly. The village of [[Artix, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Artix]] is notable for having elected to post street signs in the local language.

===Usage outside France===
[[File:Europe2005 bossost-aranes1.jpg|thumb|Aranese signage in [[Bossòst]], [[Val d'Aran]], Spain]]

* In the Val d'Aran, in the northwest corner of Catalonia, Spain, Aranese (a variety of Gascon) is spoken. It is an official language of Catalonia together with Catalan and Spanish.
* In Italy, Occitan is also spoken in the [[Occitan Valleys]] ([[Alps]]) in [[Piedmont]] and [[Liguria]]. An Occitan-speaking enclave also has existed at [[Guardia Piemontese]] ([[Calabria]]) since the 14th century. Italy adopted in 1999 a ''Linguistic Minorities Protection Law'', or "Law 482", which includes Occitan; however, [[Italian language|Italian]] is the dominant language. It should be noted that the [[Piedmontese language]] is extremely close to Occitan.
* In [[Monaco]], some Occitan speakers coexist with remaining native speakers of [[Monégasque dialect|Monégasque]] ([[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]]). French is the dominant language.
* Scattered Occitan-speaking communities have existed in different countries:
** There were Occitan-speaking colonies in [[Württemberg]] (Germany) since the 18th century, as a consequence of the [[Camisard]] war. The last Occitan speakers were heard in the 1930s.
** In the Spanish [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque country]], Gascon was spoken in the centre of Donostia-San Sebastián, perhaps until the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osoa.net/Articles/Desaparicion_del_Euskara_por_el_este_y_norte.pdf Desparicion del Euskara por el norte y el este] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327223934/http://www.osoa.net/Articles/Desaparicion_del_Euskara_por_el_este_y_norte.pdf |date=27 March 2012 }} (in Spanish): ''En San Sebastián [...] se habla gascón desde el siglo XIV hasta el 1919''&lt;/ref&gt;
** In the Americas, Occitan speakers exist:

*** in Canada, in [[Quebec]] where there are Occitan associations such as ''Association Occitane du Québec'' and ''Association des Occitans''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatries-france.com/resultVille.php?co=0&amp;mots=24&amp;mot2=14 Expatries-france.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Selection Villes&lt;/ref&gt;
*** [[Pigüé|Pigüé, Argentina]] – Community settled by 165 Occitans from the Rodez-Aveyron area of Cantal in the late 19th century.
*** [[Guanajuato|Guanajuato, Mexico]] – A sparse number of Occitan settlers are known to have settled in that state in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mexicofrancia.org/articulos/p17.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditionally Occitan-speaking areas===
* [[Aquitaine]] – excluding the Basque-speaking part of the [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]] in the western part of the department and a small part of [[Gironde]] where the ''langue d'oïl'' [[Saintongeais dialect]] is spoken. 
* [[Midi-Pyrénées]] – including one of France's largest cities, [[Toulouse]]. There are a few street signs in Toulouse in Occitan, and since late 2009 the [[Toulouse Metro]] announcements are bilingual French-Occitan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2009/08/03/648785-On-va-parler-occitan-dans-le-metro-des-la-rentree.html|title=On va parler occitan dans le métro dès la rentrée|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise the language is almost never heard spoken on the street.
* [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] (from "Lenga d'òc") – including the areas around the medieval city of [[Carcassonne]], excluding the large part of the [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] where Catalan is spoken ([[Fenolheda]] is the only Occitan-speaking area of the Pyrénées-Orientales).
* [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] – except for the Roya and Bévéra valleys, where there is a transitional dialect between Ligurian and Occitan, (''Roiasc'', including the [[Brigasc dialect]] of Ligurian). In the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Alpes-Maritimes]] there were once isolated towns that spoke [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], but those varieties are now extinct. The [[Mentonasc dialect]] of Ligurian, spoken in [[Menton]], is a Ligurian transition dialect with a strong Occitan influence.
* In [[Monaco]], Occitan, imported by immigrants coexisted in the 19th and 20th centuries with the [[Monégasque dialect]] of Ligurian. [[French language|French]] is the dominant language.
* [[Poitou-Charentes]] – Use of Occitan has declined here in the few parts it used to be spoken, replaced by French. Only Charente Limousine, the eastern part of the region, has resisted. The natural and historical languages of most of the region are the ''langues d'oïl'' [[Poitevin dialect|Poitevin]] and Saintongeais.
* [[Limousin]] – A rural region (about 710,000 inhabitants) where Limousin is still spoken among the oldest residents.
* [[Auvergne (region)|Auvergne]] – The language's use has declined in some urban areas. The department of [[Allier]] is divided between a southern, Occitan-speaking area and a northern, French-speaking area.
* [[Centre-Val de Loire]] – Some villages in the extreme South speak Occitan.
* [[Rhône-Alpes]] – While the south of the region is clearly Occitan-speaking, the central and northern [[Lyonnais]], [[Forez]] and [[Dauphiné]] parts belong to the [[Franco-Provençal language]] area.
* [[Occitan Valleys]] ([[Piedmont]]) – Italian region where Occitan is spoken only in the southern and central Alpine valleys.
* [[Val d'Aran]] – part of Catalonia that speaks a mountain dialect of Gascon.

===Number of speakers===
The area where Occitan was historically dominant has approximately 16 million inhabitants. Recent research has shown it may be spoken as a first language by approximately 789,000 people&lt;ref name="bernissan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="martel" /&gt; in [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Monaco]]. In Monaco, Occitan coexists with [[monégasque language|Monégasque]] [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], which is the other native language.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre, Bec. (1995) ''La langue occitane, coll. Que sais-je?'' n° 1059, Paris: Presses Universitaires de France.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arveiller, Raymond. (1967) ''Étude sur le parler de Monaco'', Monaco: Comité National des Traditions Monégasques, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers state that up to seven million people in France understand the language,&lt;ref&gt;Klinkenberg, Jean-Marie.

''Encyclopedia of bilingualism and bilingual education'', 1997, p. 402: "Of the 13 million inhabitants of the area where Occitan is spoken (comprising 31 ''départements'') it is estimated that about half have a knowledge of one of the Occitan varieties."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Stephen and Cathie Carmichael. ''Language and nationalism in Europe'', 2000, p. 62: "Occitan is spoken in 31 ''départements'', but even the [[European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages|EBLUL]] (1993: 15-16) is wary of statistics: 'There are no official data on the number of speakers. Of some 12 to 13 million inhabitants in the area, it is estimated 48 per cent understand Occitan, 28 per cent can speak it, about 9 per cent of the population use it on a daily basis, 13 per cent can read and 6 per cent can write the language.'"&lt;/ref&gt; whereas twelve to fourteen million fully spoke it in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anglade|1921}}: ''La Langue d'Oc est parlée actuellement par douze ou quatorze millions de Français'' ("Occitan is now spoken by twelve or fourteen million French citizens").&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Demographics of France#Historical population of metropolitan France|1860]], Occitan speakers represented more than 39%&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Backer|1860|pp=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5846989r.f61 52, 54]}}: ''parlée dans le Midi de la France par quatorze millions d'habitants'' ("spoken in the South of France by fourteen million inhabitants").&lt;/ref&gt; of the whole French population (52% for [[francophone]]s proper); they were still 26% to 36% in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gaussen |1927|p=[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k57104841.image.langEN.f6.pagination 4]}}: ''...défendre une langue, qui est aujourd'hui la mère de la nôtre, parlée encore par plus de dix millions d'individus...''

==Dialects==
[[File:Dialectes de l'occitan selon Pierre Bec.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Occitan dialects according to [[Pèire Bèc|Pierre Bec]]]]
[[File:Bec supradialectal.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Supradialectal classification of Occitan according to Bec]]
[[File:Sumien supradialectal.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Supradialectal classification of Occitan according to Sumien]]
Occitan is fundamentally defined by its dialects, rather than being a unitary language. That point is very conflictual in Southern France, as many people do not recognize Occitan as a real language and think that the next defined "dialects" are languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.languegasconne.com/liens-et-partenaires/alliance-des-langues-doc/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109110416/http://www.languegasconne.com/liens-et-partenaires/alliance-des-langues-doc/index.html |archive-date=9 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other languages that fundamentally exist at a spoken, rather than written, level (e.g. the [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Astur-Leonese languages|Astur-Leonese]], and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]), every settlement technically has its own dialect, with the whole of Occitania forming a classic [[dialect continuum]] that changes gradually along any path from one side to the other. Nonetheless, specialists commonly divide Occitan into six main dialects:
* [[Gascon language|Gascon]]: includes the [[Béarnese dialect|Béarnese]] and [[Aranese dialect|Aranese]] (spoken in Spain).
* [[Languedocien dialect|Languedocien]] (''lengadocian'')
* [[Limousin dialect|Limousin]] (''lemosin'')
* [[Auvergnat dialect|Auvergnat]] (''auvernhat'')
* [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]] (''provençau'' or ''prouvençau''), including the [[Niçois|Niçard]] subdialect.
** [[Shuadit language]]
* [[Vivaro-Alpine]] (''vivaroaupenc''), also known as "Alpine" or "Alpine Provençal", and sometimes considered a subdialect of Provençal

Gascon is the most divergent, and descriptions of the main features of Occitan often consider Gascon separately. Max Wheeler notes that "probably only its copresence within the French cultural sphere has kept [Gascon] from being regarded as a separate language", and compares it to Franco-Provençal, which is considered a separate language from Occitan but is "probably not more divergent from Occitan overall than Gascon is".&lt;ref name="wheeler"&gt;{{citation|contribution=Occitan|first=Max|last=Wheeler|title=The Romance Languages|editor1-first=Martin|editor1-last=Harris|editor2-first=Nigel|editor2-last=Vincent|year=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|place=New York|pages=246–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no general agreement about larger groupings of these dialects.

Max Wheeler divides the dialects into two groups:&lt;ref name="wheeler"/&gt;
*Southwestern (Gascon and Languedocien), more conservative
*Northeastern (Limousin, Auvergnat, Provençal and Vivaro-Alpine), more innovative

[[Pèire Bèc|Pierre Bec]] divides the dialects into three groups:{{sfn|Bec|1973}}
*Gascon, standing alone
*Southern Occitan (Languedocien and Provençal)
*Northern Occitan (Limousin, Auvergnat, Vivaro-Alpine)

Bec also notes that some linguists prefer a "supradialectal" classification that groups Occitan with [[Catalan language|Catalan]] as a part of a wider Occitano-Romanic group. One such classification posits three groups:
*"Arverno-Mediterranean" (''arvèrnomediterranèu''), same as Wheeler's northeastern group, i.e. Limousin, Auvergnat, Provençal and Vivaro-Alpine
*"Central Occitan" (''occitan centrau''), Languedocien, excepting the Southern Languedocien subdialect
*"Aquitano-Pyrenean" (''aquitanopirenenc''), Southern Languedocien, Gascon and Catalan
According to this view, Catalan is an [[ausbau language]] that became independent from Occitan during the 13th century, but originates from the Aquitano-Pyrenean group.

[[Domergue Sumien]] proposes a slightly different supradialectal grouping.&lt;ref name=sumien2006&gt;Domergue Sumien (2006), ''La standardisation pluricentrique de l'occitan: nouvel enjeu sociolinguistique, développement du lexique et de la morphologie'', Publications de l'Association Internationale d'Études Occitanes, Turnhout: Brepols&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arverno-Mediterranean (''arvèrnomediterranèu''), same as in Bec and Wheeler, divided further:
** Niçard-Alpine (''niçardoaupenc''), Vivaro-Alpine along with the Niçard subdialect of Provençal
** Trans-Occitan (''transoccitan''), the remainder of Provençal along with Limousin and Auvergnat
* Pre-Iberian (''preïberic'')
** Central Occitan (''occitan centrau''), same as in Bec
** Aquitano-Pyrenean (''aquitanopirenenc''), same as in Bec

==Codification==

===Standardisation===
All these regional varieties of the Occitan language are written and valid. Standard Occitan, also called ''occitan larg'' (i.e., 'wide Occitan') is a synthesis that respects and admits soft regional adaptations (which are based on the convergence of previous regional [[Koiné language|koinés]]). So Occitan can be considered as a [[pluricentric language]].&lt;ref name=sumien2006/&gt; The standardisation process began with the publication of ''[[Gramatica occitana segon los parlars lengadocians]]'', grammar of the languedocien dialect, by [[Louis Alibert]] (1935), followed by the ''[[Dictionnaire occitan-français selon les parlers languedociens]]'' (French-Occitan dictionary according to Languedocien) by the same author (1966), completed during the 1970s with the works of [[Pierre Bec]] (Gascon), [[Robèrt Lafont]] (Provençal) and others. But it has not been achieved yet{{clarify|date=April 2013}}. It is mostly supported by users of the [[Occitan language#Writing system|classical norm]]. Due to the strong situation of [[diglossia]], some users still reject the standardisation process and do not conceive Occitan as a language that could work just as other standardised languages.

===Writing system===
{{further information|Occitan alphabet}}
There are two main linguistic norms currently used for Occitan, one (known as "classical"), which is based on that of Medieval Occitan, and one (sometimes known as "Mistralian", due to its use by [[Frédéric Mistral]]), which is based on modern [[French orthography]]. Sometimes, there is conflict between users of each system.
* The ''classical norm'' (or less exactly ''classical orthography'') has the advantage of maintaining a link with earlier stages of the language, and reflects the fact that Occitan is not a variety of French. It is used in all Occitan dialects. It also allows speakers of one dialect of Occitan to write intelligibly for speakers of other dialects (e.g. the Occitan for ''day'' is written ''jorn'' in the classical norm, but could be ''jour'', ''joun'', ''journ'', or even ''yourn'', depending on the writer's origin, in Mistralian orthography). The Occitan classical orthography and the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] orthography are quite similar: They show the very close ties of both languages. The digraphs ''lh'' and ''nh'', used in the classical orthography, were adopted by the [[Portuguese alphabet#Basic digraphs|orthography of Portuguese]], presumably by [[Gerald of Braga]], a monk from [[Moissac]], who became bishop of [[Braga]] in Portugal in 1047, playing a major role in modernizing written [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] using classical Occitan norms.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Juge (2001) ''Petit précis – Chronologie occitane – Histoire &amp; civilisation'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Mistralian norm]]'' (or less exactly ''Mistralian orthography'') has the advantage of being similar to that of French, in which most Occitan speakers are literate. Now, it is used mostly in the [[Provençal (dialect)|Provençal]]/[[Niçard]] dialect, besides the classical norm. It has also been used by a number of eminent writers, particularly in Provençal. However, it is somewhat impractical, because it is based mainly on the Provençal dialect and also uses many digraphs for simple sounds, the most notable one being ''ou'' for the [u] sound, as it is in French, written as ''o'' under the classical orthography.

There are also two other norms but they have a lesser audience. The ''Escòla dau Pò norm'' (or ''Escolo dóu Po norm'') is a simplified version of the Mistralian norm and is used only in the Occitan Valleys (Italy), besides the classical norm. The ''Bonnaudian norm'' (or ''écriture auvergnate unifiée, EAU'') was created by Pierre Bonnaud and is used only in the [[Auvergnat]] dialect, besides the classical norm.

===Debates concerning linguistic classification and orthography===
The majority of scholars think that Occitan constitutes a single language.{{sfn|Kremnitz|2002|pp=109-111}} Some authors,&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Blanchet, Louis Bayle, Pierre Bonnaud and Jean Lafitte&lt;/ref&gt; constituting a minority,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kremnitz|2002|pp=109–111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; reject this opinion and even the name ''Occitan'', thinking that there is a family of distinct {{lang|oc|lengas d'òc}} rather than dialects of a single language.

Many Occitan linguists and writers,&lt;ref&gt;Kremnitz, Georg (2003) "Un regard sociolinguistique sur les changements de la situation de l’occitan depuis 1968" in: Castano R., Guida, S., &amp; Latella, F. (2003) (dir.) ''Scènes, évolutions, sort de la langue et de la littérature d’oc. Actes du VIIe congrès de l’Association Internationale d’Études Occitanes'', Reggio di Calabria/Messina, 7-13 juillet 2002, Rome: Viella&lt;/ref&gt; particularly those involved with the pan-Occitan movement centred on the [[Institut d'Estudis Occitans]], disagree with the view that Occitan is a family of languages and think that Limousin, Auvergnat, Languedocien, Gascon, Provençal and Vivaro-Alpine are dialects of a single language. Although there are indeed noticeable differences between these varieties, there is a very high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] between them;&lt;ref&gt;For traditional Romance philology see:
:*{{citation | last=Ronjat | first=Jules | year=1913 | title=Essai de syntaxe des parlers provençaux modernes | publisher=Protat | place=Macon | language=French | page=12 | url=https://archive.org/stream/essaidesyntaxede00ronjuoft#page/12/mode/2up }}: {{lang|fr|Mais les différences de phonétique, de morphologie, de syntaxe et de vocabulaire ne sont pas telles qu'une personne connaissant pratiquement à fond un de nos dialectes ne puisse converser dans ce dialecte avec une autre personne parlant un autre dialecte qu'elle possède pratiquement à fond.}} (But phonetic, morphological, syntactical and lexical differences are not such that a person quite perfectly fluent in one of our dialects would not be able to have a conversation with another person speaking another dialect with an equally perfect fluency).
:*{{citation | last=Ronjat | first=Jules | year=1930 | title= Grammaire historique des parlers provençaux modernes | publisher=Société des langues romanes (Volume 1) | place= Montpellier | pages=1–32 | url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k58339580/f32.image | language=French }}.
:For a discussion of the unity of the Occitan [[diasystem]] in structural linguistics see {{harvnb|Bec|1973|pp=24–25}}.&lt;/ref&gt; they also share a common literary history, and in academic and literary circles, have been identified as a collective linguistic entity&amp;mdash;the {{lang|oc|lenga d'òc}}&amp;mdash;for centuries.

Some Provençal authors continue to support the view that Provençal is a separate language.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Blanchet, Louis Bayle&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the vast majority of Provençal authors and associations think that Provençal is a part of Occitan.&lt;ref&gt;The most emblematic and productive ones, [[Frédéric Mistral]], [[Robert Lafont]], and their followers ([[Théodore Aubanel]], [http://www.rene-merle.com/ René Merle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627091610/http://www.rene-merle.com/ |date=27 June 2007 }}, Claude Barsotti, Philippe Gardy, Florian Vernet, Bernard Giély, Pierre Pessemesse...), and also the most important and historic Provençal cultural associations as [http://c-oc.org/oc/provenca/article.php3?id_article=10 CREO Provença]{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, [http://www.felibrige.org/spip.php?article3 Felibrige] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015112912/http://www.felibrige.org/spip.php?article3 |date=15 October 2007 }} and [http://www.prouvenco-aro.com/archieu/outobre.htm Parlaren (Assiso de la Lengo Nostro en Prouvènço, 2003)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040228224426/http://www.prouvenco-aro.com/archieu/outobre.htm |date=28 February 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This debate about the status of Provençal should not be confused with the debate concerning the spelling of Provençal.
*The '''classical orthography''' is [[phonemic orthography|phonemic]] and [[diasystem]]ic, and thus more pan-Occitan. It can be used for (and adapted to) all Occitan dialects and regions, including Provençal. Its supporters think that Provençal is a part of Occitan.
*The '''Mistralian orthography''' of Provençal is more or less phonemic but not diasystemic and is closer to the [[French language|French]] spelling and therefore more specific to Provençal; its users are divided between the ones who think that Provençal is a part of Occitan and the ones who think that Provençal is a separate language.

For example, the classical system writes ''Polonha'', whereas the Mistralian spelling system has ''Poulougno'', for {{IPA|[puˈluɲo]}}, 'Poland'.

The question of [[Gascon language|Gascon]] is similar. Gascon presents a number of significant differences from the rest of the language; but, despite these differences, Gascon and other Occitan dialects have very important common lexical and grammatical features, so authors such as Pierre Bec argue that they could never be considered as different as, for example, Spanish and Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bec|1963|p=46}}: The close ties between Gascon and others Occitan dialects have been demonstrated through a common diasystem.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Gascon's being included in Occitan despite its particular differences can be justified because there is a common elaboration (''[[Ausbau language|Ausbau]]'') process between Gascon and the rest of Occitan.{{sfn|Kremnitz|2002|pp=109-111}} The vast majority of the Gascon cultural movement considers itself as a part of the Occitan cultural movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pernoste.com/|title=Per Noste edicions|website=www.pernoste.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://perso.orange.fr/anaram/ Perso.orange.fr], Aranaram Au Patac&lt;/ref&gt; And the official status of [[Val d'Aran]] ([[Catalonia]], Spain), adopted in 1990, says that [[Aranese]] is a part of [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Occitan]]. A grammar of Aranese by Aitor Carrera, published in 2007 in [[Lleida]], presents the same view.{{sfn|Carrera|2007}}

The exclusion of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] from the Occitan sphere, even though Catalan is closely related, is justified because there has been a consciousness of its being different from Occitan since the later Middle Ages and because the elaboration (''Ausbau'') processes of Catalan and Occitan (including Gascon) have been quite distinct since the 20th century. Nevertheless, other scholars point out that the process that led to the affirmation of Catalan as a distinct language from Occitan started during the period when the pressure to include Catalan-speaking areas in a mainstream Spanish culture was at its greatest.&lt;ref&gt;Lluis Fornés, see his thesis [http://www.oc-valencia.org/files/autors/El_Pensament_Ultima.pdf El Pensament Panoccitanista] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003112058/http://www.oc-valencia.org/files/autors/El_Pensament_Ultima.pdf |date=3 October 2008 }} on [http://www.oc-valencia.org/ Òc-Valéncia's website].&lt;/ref&gt;

The answer to the question of whether [[Gascon language|Gascon]] or [[Catalan language|Catalan]] should be considered dialects of Occitan or separate languages has long been a matter of opinion or convention, rather than based on scientific ground. However, two recent studies support Gascon's being considered a distinct language. For the very first time, a quantifiable, statistics-based approach was applied by Stephan Koppelberg in attempt to solve this issue.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Koppelberg, El lèxic hereditari caracteristic de l'occità i del gascó i la seva relació amb el del català (conclusions d'un analisi estadística), Actes del vuitè Col·loqui Internacional de Llengua i Literatura Catalana, Volume 1 (1988). Antoni M. Badia Margarit &amp; Michel Camprubi ed. (in Catalan)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the results he obtained, he concludes that Catalan, Occitan, and Gascon should all be considered three distinct languages. More recently, Y. Greub and J.P. Chambon (Sorbonne University, Paris) demonstrated that the formation of Proto-Gascon was already complete at the eve of the 7th century, whereas Proto-Occitan was not yet formed at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chambon |first=Jean-Pierre  |last2=Greub |first2=Yan  |year=2002 |title=Note sur l'âge du (proto)gascon |journal=Revue de Linguistique Romane |language=French |volume=66 |pages=473-495}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results induced linguists to do away with the conventional classification of Gascon, favoring the "distinct language" alternative.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Both studies supported the early intuition of late [[Kurt Baldinger]], a specialist of both medieval Occitan and medieval Gascon, who recommended that Occitan and Gascon be classified as separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baldinger |first=Kurt |year=1962 |title=La langue des documents en ancien gascon |journal=Revue de Linguistique Romane |language=French |volume=26 |pages=331-347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baldinger |first=Kurt |year=1962 |title=Textes anciens gascons |journal=Revue de Linguistique Romane, |language=French |volume=26 |pages=348-362}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this statement{{which|date=October 2016}} hurts the Occitanist doctrine, which states as one of its fundamental dogmas, that Gascon is a dialect of Occitan, {{citation needed span|date=October 2016|text=so linguists of the Occitanist movement tend not to take these studies into account}}.

==Linguistic characterisation==
{{More footnotes|section|date=July 2011}}
Jules Ronjat has sought to characterize Occitan by 19 principal criteria, as generalized as possible. Of those, 11 are phonetic, five morphologic, one syntactic, and two lexical. Close rounded vowels are rare or absent in Occitan. This characteristic often carries through to an Occitan speaker's French, leading to a distinctive ''[[Meridional French|méridional]]'' accent. Unlike French, it is a [[pro-drop language]], allowing the omission of the subject (''canti'': I sing; ''cantas'' you sing). Among these 19 discriminating criteria, 7 are different from Spanish, 8 from Italian, 12 from Franco-Provençal, and 16 from French.

===Features of Occitan===
Most features of Occitan are shared with either [[French language|French]] or [[Catalan language|Catalan]], or both.

====Features of Occitan as a whole====
Examples of pan-Occitan features shared with French, but not Catalan:
* Latin {{smallcaps|ū}} [uː] (Vulgar Latin {{IPA|/u/}}) changed to {{IPA|/y/}}, as in French (Lat. {{smallcaps|dūrvm}} &amp;gt; Oc. ''dur'').
* Vulgar Latin {{IPA|/o/}} changed to {{IPA|/u/}}, first in unstressed syllables, as in Catalan (Lat. {{smallcaps|romānvs}} &gt; Oc. ''roman'' [ru'ma]), then in stressed syllables (Lat. {{smallcaps|flōrem}} &gt; Oc. ''flor'' [fluɾ]).

Examples of pan-Occitan features shared with Catalan, but not French:
* Stressed Latin {{smallcaps|a}} was preserved (Lat. {{smallcaps|mare}} &gt; Oc. ''mar'', Fr. ''mer'').
* Intervocalic -{{smallcaps|t}}- was lenited to {{IPA|/d/}} rather than lost (Lat. {{smallcaps|vitam}} &gt; Oc. ''vida'', Fr. ''vie'').

Examples of pan-Occitan features not shared with Catalan or French:
* Original {{IPA|/aw/}} preserved.
* Final {{IPA|/a/}} becomes {{IPA|/ɔ/}} (note in [[Valencian]] (Catalan), {{IPA|/ɔ/}} may appear in word-final unstressed position, in a process of [[vowel harmony]]).
* Low-mid {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} diphthongized before velars.  {{IPA|/ɛ/}} generally becomes {{IPA|/jɛ/}}; {{IPA|/ɔ/}} originally became {{IPA|/wɔ/}} or {{IPA|/wɛ/}}, but has since usually undergone further fronting (e.g. to {{IPA|[wœ], [œ], [ɛ]}}, etc.). Diphthongization also occurred before palatals, as in French and Catalan.
* Various assimilations in consonant clusters (e.g. {{angle bracket|cc}} in ''Occitan'', pronounced {{IPA|/utsiˈta/}} in conservative Languedocien).

====Features of some Occitan dialects====
Examples of dialect-specific features of the northerly dialects shared with French, but not Catalan:
* Palatalization of {{smallcaps|ca-, ga-}} to {{IPA|/tʃa, dʒa/}}.
* Vocalization of syllable-final {{IPA|/l/}} to {{IPA|/w/}}.
* Loss of final consonants.
* Vocalization of syllable-final nasals to [[nasal vowel]]s.
* [[Uvular R|Uvularization]] of some or all {{angle bracket|r}} sounds.

Examples of dialect-specific features of the southerly dialects (or some of them) shared with Catalan, but not French:
* Latin {{smallcaps|-mb-,-nd-}} become {{IPA|/m, n/}}.
* [[Betacism]]: {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} merge (feature shared with some Catalan dialects; except for Balearic, Valencian and Alguerese Catalan, where {{IPA|/v/}} is preserved).
* Intervocalic voiced stops {{IPA|/b d ɡ/}} (from Latin {{smallcaps|-p-, -t, -c-}}) become voiced fricatives {{IPA|[β ð ɣ]}}.
* Loss of word-final single {{IPA|/n/}} (but not {{IPA|/nn/}}, e.g. ''an'' "year" &lt; {{smallcaps|ānnvm}}).

Examples of [[Gascon language|Gascon]]-specific features not shared with French or Catalan:
* Latin initial {{IPA|/f/}} changed into {{IPA|/h/}} (Lat. {{smallcaps|filivm}} &gt;  Gasc. ''hilh''). This also happened in [[History of Spanish|medieval Spanish]], although the {{IPA|/h/}} was eventually lost, or reverted to {{IPA|/f/}} (before a consonant). The Gascon {{angle bracket|h}} has retained its [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]].
* Loss of {{IPA|/n/}} between vowels. This also happened in [[History of Portuguese|Portuguese]] and [[Galician language|Galician]] (and moreover also in [[Basque language|Basque]]).
* Change of {{smallcaps|-ll-}} to {{angle bracket|r}} {{IPA|/ɾ/}}, or {{angle bracket|th}} word-finally (originally the [[voiceless palatal stop]] {{IPA|/c/}}, but now generally either {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, depending on the word). This is a unique characteristic of Gascon and of certain [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] dialects.

Examples of other dialect-specific features not shared with French or Catalan:
* Merging of syllable-final nasals to {{IPA|/ŋ/}}. This appears to represent a transitional stage before nasalization, and occurs especially in the southerly dialects other than Gascon (which still maintains different final nasals, as in Catalan).
* Former intervocalic {{IPA|/ð/}} (from Latin {{smallcaps|-d-}}) becomes /z/ (most dialects, but not Gascon). This appears to have happened in primitive Catalan as well, but Catalan later deleted this sound or converted it to {{IPA|/w/}}.
* Palatalization of {{IPA|/jt/}} (from Latin {{smallcaps|ct}}) to {{IPA|/tʃ/}} in most dialects or {{IPA|/(j)t/}}: ''lach'' vs ''lait'' (Gascon ''lèit'') 'milk', ''lucha'' vs ''luta'' (Gascon ''luta'') 'fight'.
* Weakening of {{IPA|/l/}} to {{IPA|/r/}} in the Vivaro-Alpine dialect.

===Lexicon===
A comparison of terms and word counts between languages is not easy, as it is impossible to count the number of words in a language. (See [[Lexicon]], [[Lexeme]], [[Lexicography]] for more information.)

Some have claimed around 450,000 words exist in the Occitan language,&lt;ref&gt;Avner Gerard Levy &amp; Jacques Ajenstat: [http://www.kodaxil.org/kManifesto.pdf ''The Kodaxil Semantic Manifesto'']{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (2006), Section 10 – ''Modified Base64 / Kodaxil word length, representation'', p. 9: "the English language, as claimed by Merriam-Webster, as well as the Occitan language – are estimated to comprise over 450,000 words in their basic form."&lt;/ref&gt; a number comparable to English (the [[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]], Unabridged with 1993 addenda reaches 470,000 words, as does the Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition). The Merriam-Webster Web site estimates that the number is somewhere between 250,000 and 1 million words.

The magazine [[GEO (magazine)|''Géo'']] (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;79) claims that American English literature can be more easily translated into Occitan than French, excluding modern technological terms that both languages have integrated.

A comparison of the lexical content can find more subtle differences between the languages. For example, Occitan has 128 synonyms related to cultivated land, 62 for wetlands, and 75 for sunshine (''Géo''). The language went through an eclipse during the [[Industrial Revolution]], as the vocabulary of the countryside became less important. At the same time, it was disparaged as a [[patois]]. Nevertheless, Occitan has also incorporated new words into its lexicon to describe the modern world. The Occitan word for web is ''oèb'', for example.

One interesting and useful feature of the Occitan language is its virtually infinite ability to create new words through a number of interchangeable and embeddable suffixes, giving the original terms a whole array of semantic nuances.

===Differences between Occitan and Catalan===
The separation of Catalan from Occitan is seen by some{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} as largely politically (rather than linguistically) motivated. However, the variety that has become standard Catalan differs from the one that has become standard Occitan in a number of ways. Here are just a few examples:
* [[Phonology]] {{Main article|Occitan phonology|Catalan phonology}}
** Standard Catalan (based on Central Eastern Catalan) is unique in that Latin short ''e'' developed into a close vowel {{IPA|/e/}} (''é'') and Latin long ''e'' developed into an open vowel {{IPA|/ɛ/}} (''è''); that is precisely the reverse of the development that took place in Western Catalan dialects and the rest of the Romance languages, including Occitan. Thus Standard Catalan ''ésser'' {{IPA|[ˈesə]}} corresponds to Occitan ''èsser/èstre'' {{IPA|[ˈɛse/ˈɛstre]}} 'to be;' Catalan {{lang|ca|carrer}} {{IPA|[kəˈre]}} corresponds to Occitan ''carrièra'' {{IPA-oc|karˈjɛɾo̞|}} 'street', but it is also ''carriera'' {{IPA-oc|karˈjeɾo̞|}}, in Provençal.
** The distinctly Occitan development of word-final ''-a'', pronounced {{IPA|[o̞]}} in standard Occitan (''chifra'' 'figure' {{IPA|[ˈtʃifro̞]}}), did not occur in general Catalan (which has ''xifra'' {{IPA|[ˈʃifrə]}}). However, some Occitan varieties also lack that feature, and some Catalan ([[Valencian]]) varieties have the {{IPA|[ɔ]}} pronunciation, mostly by vowel harmony.
** When in Catalan word stress falls in the antepenultimate syllable, in Occitan the stress is moved to the penultimate syllable: for example, Occitan ''pagina'' {{IPA|[paˈdʒino̞]}} vs. Catalan ''pàgina'' {{IPA|[ˈpaʒinə]}}, "page". However, some varieties of Occitan (such as around Nice) keep the stress on the antepenultimate syllable ''(pàgina)'', and some varieties of Catalan (in Northern Catalonia) put the stress on the penultimate syllable ''(pagina)''.
** [[Diphthong]]isation has evolved in different ways: Occitan ''paire'' vs. Catalan ''pare'' 'father;' Occitan ''carrièra (carrèra, carrèira)'' vs. Catalan ''carrera''.
** Some Occitan dialects lack the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] phoneme {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, but south-western Occitan has it: general Occitan ''caissa'' {{IPA|[ˈkajso̞]}} vs. Catalan ''caixa'' {{IPA|[ˈkaʃə]}} and south-western Occitan ''caissa, caisha'' {{IPA|[ˈka(j)ʃo̞]}}, 'box.' Nevertheless, some [[Western Catalan|Valencian dialects]] like Northern Valencian lack that phoneme too and generally substitute {{IPA|/jsʲ/}}: ''caixa'' {{IPA|[ˈkajʃa]}} (Standard Valencian) ~ {{IPA|[ˈkajsʲa]}} (Northern Valencian).
** Occitan has developed the [[close front rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/y/}} as a [[phoneme]], often (but not always) corresponding to Catalan {{IPA|/u/}}: Occitan ''musica'' {{IPA|[myˈziko̞]}} vs. Catalan ''música'' {{IPA|[ˈmuzikə]}}.
** The distribution of [[palatal consonant]]s {{IPA|/ʎ/}} and {{IPA|/ɲ/}} differs in Catalan and part of Occitan: while Catalan permits them in word-final position, in central Occitan they are [[Phoneme#Neutralization.2C archiphoneme.2C underspecification|neutralised]] to {{IPA|[l]}} and {{IPA|[n]}} (Central Occitan ''filh'' {{IPA|[fil]}} vs. Catalan ''fill'' {{IPA|[fiʎ]}}, 'son'). Non-central varieties of Occitan, however, my have a palatal realization (e.g. ''filh, hilh'' {{IPA|[fiʎ, fij, hiʎ]}}). However, [[Algherese|Alguerese Catalan]] neutralizes palatal consonants in word-final position as well.
** Also, many words that start with {{IPA|/l/}} in Occitan start with {{IPA|/ʎ/}} in Catalan: Occitan ''libre'' {{IPA|[ˈliβɾe]}} vs. Catalan ''llibre'' {{IPA|[ˈʎiβɾə]}}, 'book.' That is perhaps one of the most distinctive characteristics of Catalan amongst the Romance languages, shared only with [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]] and [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]]. However, some transitional varieties of Occitan, near the Catalan area, also have initial {{IPA|/ʎ/}}.
**While {{IPA|/l/}} is always clear in Occitan, in Catalan it tends to be [[velarization|velarized]] {{IPA|[ɫ]}} ("[[dark l]]"). In coda position, {{IPA|/l/}} has tended to be vocalized to {{IPA|[w]}} in Occitan, while remained dark in Catalan.
** Standard [[Eastern Catalan]] has a [[schwa|neutral vowel]] {{IPA|[ə]}} whenever ''a'' or ''e'' occur in unstressed position (''passar'' {{IPA|[pəˈsa]}}, 'to happen', but ''passa'' {{IPA|[ˈpasə]}}, 'it happens'), and also {{IPA|[u]}} whenever ''o'' or ''u'' occur in unstressed position, e.g. ''obrir'' {{IPA|[uˈβɾi]}}, 'to open', but ''obre'' {{IPA|[ˈɔβɾə]}}, 'you open'. However, that does not apply to [[Western Catalan]] dialects, whose vowel system usually retains the ''a''/''e'' distinction in unstressed position, or to Northern Catalan dialects, whose vowel system does not retain the ''o''/''u'' distinction in stressed position, much like Occitan.
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]]
** Verb [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] is slightly different, but there is a great variety amongst dialects. Medieval conjugations were much closer. A characteristic difference is the ending of the second person plural, which is ''-u'' in Catalan but ''-tz'' in Occitan. {{further information|Occitan conjugation|Catalan conjugation}}
** Occitan tends to add an [[analogy|analogical]] -''a'' to the [[grammatical gender|feminine]] forms of adjectives that are invariable in standard Catalan: for example, Occitan ''legal'' / ''legala'' vs. Catalan ''legal'' / ''legal''.
** Catalan has a distinctive past tense formation, known as the 'periphrastic preterite', formed from a variant of the verb 'to go' followed by the infinitive of the verb: ''donar'' 'to give,' ''va donar'' 'he gave.' That has the same value as the 'normal' preterite shared by most Romance languages, deriving from the Latin perfect tense: Catalan ''donà'' 'he gave.' The periphrastic preterite, in Occitan, is an archaic or a very local tense.
* [[Orthography]]
** The writing systems of the two languages differ slightly. The modern Occitan spelling recommended by the [[Institut d'Estudis Occitans]] and the [[Conselh de la Lenga Occitana]] is designed to be a pan-Occitan system, and the Catalan system recommended by the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans]] and [[Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua]] is specific to Catalan and Valencian. For example, in Catalan, word-final ''-n'' is omitted, as it is not pronounced in any dialect of Catalan (''Català'', ''Occità''); central Occitan also drops word-final ''-n'', but it is retained in the spelling, as some eastern and western dialects of Occitan still have it (''Catalan'', ''Occitan''). Some digraphs are also written in a different way such as the sound {{IPA|/ʎ/}}, which is ''ll'' in Catalan (similar to Spanish) and ''lh'' in Occitan (similar to Portuguese) or the sound {{IPA|/ɲ/}} written ''ny'' in Catalan and ''nh'' in Occitan.

===Occitano-Romance linguistic group===
Despite these differences, Occitan and Catalan remain more or less [[mutual intelligibility|mutually comprehensible]], especially when written — more so than either is with Spanish or French, for example, although this is mainly a consequence of using the classical (orthographical) norm of the Occitan, which is precisely focused in showing the similarities between the Occitan dialects with Catalan. Occitan and Catalan form a common diasystem (or a common [[Abstandsprache]]), which is called [[Occitano-Romance]], according to the linguist [[Pierre Bec]].&lt;ref&gt;Bec, Pierre. (1995). ''La langue occitane'', coll. Que sais-je? nr. 1059. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France [1st ed. 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of both languages share early historical and cultural heritage.

The combined Occitano-Romance area is 259,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and represents 23 million speakers. However, the regions are not equal in terms of language speakers. According to Bec 1969 (pp.&amp;nbsp;120–121), in France, no more than a quarter of the population in counted regions could speak Occitan well, though around half understood it; it is thought that the number of Occitan users has decreased dramatically since then. By contrast, in the [[Catalonia]] administered by the [[Government of Catalonia]], nearly three quarters of the population speak Catalan and 95% understand it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/socio/coneix.htm Gencat.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709074538/http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/socio/coneix.htm |date=9 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occitan quotes==
[[File:VirgendeLourdes.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|According to the testimony of [[Bernadette Soubirous]], the Virgin Mary spoke to her ([[Lourdes]], 25 March 1858) in Gascon saying: ''Que soy era Immaculada Councepciou'' ("I am the [[Immaculate Conception]]", the phrase is reproduced under this statue in the Lourdes grotto with a Mistralian/Febusian spelling), confirming the proclamation of this Catholic dogma four years earlier.]]

One of the most notable passages of Occitan in Western literature occurs in the 26th ''canto'' of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Purgatorio]]'' in which the troubadour [[Arnaut Daniel]] responds to the narrator:
:''Tan m'abellís vostre cortés deman, / qu'ieu no me puesc ni voill a vos cobrire. / Ieu sui Arnaut, que plor e vau cantan; / consirós vei la passada folor, / e vei jausen lo joi qu'esper, denan. / Ara vos prec, per aquella valor / que vos guida al som de l'escalina, / sovenha vos a temps de ma dolor.''
:Modern Occitan: ''Tan m'abelís vòstra cortesa demanda, / que ieu non pòdi ni vòli m'amagar de vos. / Ieu soi Arnaut, que plori e vau cantant; / consirós vesi la foliá passada, / e vesi joiós lo jorn qu'espèri, davant. / Ara vos prègui, per aquela valor / que vos guida al som de l'escalièr, / sovenhatz-vos tot còp de ma dolor.''

The above strophe translates to:
:So pleases me your courteous demand, / I cannot and I will not hide me from you. / I am Arnaut, who weep and singing go;/ Contrite I see the folly of the past, / And joyous see the hoped-for day before me. / Therefore do I implore you, by that power/ Which guides you to the summit of the stairs, / Be mindful to assuage my suffering!

Another notable Occitan quotation, this time from Arnaut Daniel's own 10th ''Canto'':
:''"Ieu sui Arnaut qu'amas l'aura''
:''e chatz le lebre ab lo bou''
:''e nadi contra suberna"''
Modern Occitan:
:''"Ieu soi Arnaut qu'aimi l'aura''
:''e caci [chaci] la lèbre amb lo buòu''
:''e nadi contra subèrna.''

Translation:
:"I am Arnaut who loves the wind,
:and chases the hare with the ox,
:and swims against the torrent."

French writer [[Victor Hugo]]'s classic ''[[Les Misérables]]'' also contains some Occitan. In Part One, First Book, Chapter IV, "Les œuvres semblables aux paroles", one can read about [[Bishop Myriel|Monseigneur Bienvenu]]:
:"Né provençal, il s'était facilement familiarisé avec tous les patois du midi. Il disait: — ''E ben, monsur, sètz saget?'' comme dans le bas Languedoc. — ''Ont anaratz passar?'' comme dans les basses Alpes. — ''Pòrti un bon moton amb un bon formatge gras'', comme dans le haut Dauphiné. [...] Parlant toutes les langues, il entrait dans toutes les âmes."

Translation:
:"Born a Provençal, he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south. He would say, ''E ben, monsur, sètz saget?'' as in lower Languedoc; ''Ont anaratz passar?'' as in the Basses-Alpes; ''Pòrti un bon moton amb un bon formatge gras'' as in upper Dauphiné. [...] As he spoke all tongues, he entered into all hearts."
:''E ben, monsur, sètz saget?'': So, Mister, everything's fine?
:''Ont anaratz passar?'': Which way will you go?
:''Pòrti un bon moton amb un bon formatge gras'': I brought some fine mutton with a fine fat cheese

The Spanish playwright [[Lope de Rueda]] included a Gascon servant for comical effect in one of his short pieces, ''La generosa paliza''.&lt;ref name="Rueda"&gt;''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/01159741097810429650035/p0000001.htm Registro de Representantes]'' by Lope de Rueda, in Spanish. Peirutón speaks a mix of Gascon and Catalan.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Barnes (author)|John Barnes]]'s ''Thousand Cultures'' science fiction series (''[[A Million Open Doors]]'', 1992; ''[[Earth Made of Glass]]'', 1998; ''[[The Merchants of Souls]]'', 2001; and ''[[The Armies of Memory]]'', 2006), features Occitan.
So does the 2005 best-selling novel ''[[Labyrinth (book)|Labyrinth]]'' by English author [[Kate Mosse]]. It is set in [[Carcassonne]], where she owns a house and spends half of the year.

The French composer [[Joseph Canteloube]] created five sets of folk songs entitled ''[[Songs of the Auvergne]]'', in which the lyrics are in the Auvergne dialect of Occitan. The orchestration strives to conjure vivid pastoral scenes of yesteryear.

[[Michael Crichton]] features Occitan in his ''[[Timeline (novel)|Timeline]]'' novel.

{{History of the Republic of Macedonia}}
{{Campaignbox Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia}}
The '''Ohrid Framework Agreement''' ({{lang-sq|Marrëveshja e Ohrit}}, {{lang-mk|Охридски рамковен договор|Ohridski ramkoven dogovor}}) was the peace deal signed by the government of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] and ethnic [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanian]] representatives on 13 August 2001. The agreement ended the [[2001 insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|armed conflict]] between the [[National Liberation Army (Macedonia)|National Liberation Army]] and the Macedonian security forces and set the groundwork for improving the rights of ethnic Albanians.

The Agreement also included provisions for altering the official languages of the country, with any language spoken by over 20% of the population becoming co-official with the [[Macedonian language]] at the [[Municipalities of the Republic of Macedonia|municipal level]]. Currently only the [[Albanian language]], with an approximate 25% of the population fulfils this criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ecmi.de/fileadmin/downloads/publications/JEMIE/2002/nr1/Focus1-2002Brunnbauer.pdf|title=The implementation of the Ohrid Agreement: Ethnic Macedonian resentments|first=Ulf|last=Brunnbauer|journal=Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe|format=PDF|issue=1/2002|year=2002|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the document, the version in English language is the only authentic version of the Ohrid Framework Agreement. The [[Macedonian Government]] had to adapt the [[Constitution of Macedonia]] to give the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanian minority]] living in Macedonia fifteen basic rights. The lead negotiator on the behalf of the [[United States]] in the Ohrid Agreement was [[James W. Pardew]], who had been dispatched by then-[[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Colin Powell]].

'''Pheme''' is a 36-month research project into establishing the veracity of claims made on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists develop a lie detector for tweets|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/social-media/10647974/Scientists-develop-a-lie-detector-for-tweets.html|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Unverified content is dominant and prolific in [[social media]] messages. While big data typically presents challenges in its information volume, variety and velocity, social media presents a fourth: establishing veracity. The Pheme project aims to analyse content in real time and determine how accurate the claims made in it are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists Plan Lie-Detector For Tweets|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1214023/scientists-plan-lie-detector-for-tweets|publisher=Sky News|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As claims propagate through a [[social network]], each individual chooses whether or not to pass on information, based on how accurate they think it is. Analysing the [[natural language processing|language]] used and the spread of information through a network, as well as the spatial and temporal context of the information, is used to build a real-time lie detector for social media. This will help, for example, emergency services (who already integrate social media as part of their alerting and response systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Power|first=Robert|title=Finding Fires with Twitter|journal=Proceedings Australasian Language Technology Association Workshop 2013|year=2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Earle|first=Paul S|title=Twitter earthquake detection: earthquake monitoring in a social world|journal=Annals of Geophysics|year=2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to flag potential hoax emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Researchers working on social media 'lie detector'|url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/528436|publisher=Arab News|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evaluating the authority of sources automatically is also a project goal, based on the treatment of the news and information that comes from them. For example, a tweet of a [[BBC]] news article would hold more weight than one from an unknown source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Researchers are working on a lie detector to sniff out false tweets|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/19/twitter-lie-detector/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is named after the Greek goddess [[Pheme]].

==Case studies==
Pheme addresses social media lies in two scenarios: information about healthcare, which can be particularly damaging if wrong, and information used by journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU project to build lie detector for social media|url=http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/nr/lie-detector-social-media-sheffield-twitter-facebook-1.354715|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35546">{{Linguistic typology topics}}
In [[morphological typology|linguistic typology]], '''polysynthetic languages''' are highly [[synthetic language]]s, i.e. languages in which [[word (linguistics)|words]] are composed of many [[morpheme]]s (word parts that have independent meaning but may or may not be able to stand alone). Polysynthetic languages typically have long "sentence-words" such as the [[Yupik language|Yupik]] word ''{{lang|ypk|tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq}}'' which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer." The word consists of the morphemes ''{{lang|ypk|tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq}}'' with the meanings, reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative; and except for the morpheme ''{{lang|ypk|tuntu}}'' "reindeer", none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.

Whereas [[isolating language]]s have a low morpheme-to-word ratio, polysynthetic languages have a very high ratio. There is no generally agreed upon definition of polysynthesis. Generally polysynthetic languages have [[polypersonal agreement]] although some [[agglutinative]] languages that are not polysynthetic also have it, such as [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]]. Some authors apply the term polysynthetic to languages with high morpheme-to-word ratios, but others use it for languages that are highly [[Head-marking language|head-marking]], or those that frequently use [[noun incorporation]].

Polysynthetic languages can be [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] or [[Fusional language|fusional]] depending on whether they encode one or multiple grammatical categories per affix.

At the same time, the question of whether to call a particular language polysynthetic is complicated by the fact that morpheme and word boundaries are not always clear cut, and languages may be highly synthetic in one area but less synthetic in other areas (e.g., verbs and nouns in [[Southern Athabaskan languages]] or [[Inuit languages]]). Many polysynthetic languages display complex [[evidentiality]] and/or [[mirativity]] systems in their [[verbs]].

The term was invented by [[Peter Stephen Du Ponceau]], who considered polysynthesis, as characterized by sentence words and noun incorporation, a defining feature of all [[Native American languages]]. This characterization was shown to be wrong, since many indigenous American languages are not polysynthetic,{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=39}} but it is a fact that polysynthetic languages are not evenly distributed throughout the world, but more frequent in the [[Americas]], [[Australia]], [[Siberia]], and [[New Guinea]]; however, there are also examples in other areas. The concept became part of linguistic typology with the work of [[Edward Sapir]], who used it as one of his basic typological categories. Recently, [[Mark Baker (linguist)|Mark C. Baker]] has suggested formally defining polysynthesis as a macro-parameter within [[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[principles and parameters]] theory of grammar. Other linguists question the basic utility of the concept for typology since it covers many separate morphological types that have little else in common.{{sfn|Evans|Sasse|2002}}

==Meaning==
The word "polysynthesis" is composed of the Greek roots ''poly'' meaning "many" and ''synthesis'' meaning "placing together".

In linguistics a [[word]] is defined as a unit of meaning that can stand alone in a sentence, and which can be uttered in isolation. Words may be simple, consisting of a single unit of meaning, or they can be complex, formed by combining many small units of meaning, called [[morpheme]]s. In a general non-theoretical sense polysynthetic languages are those languages that have a high degree of morphological synthesis, and which tend to form long complex words containing long strings of [[morpheme]]s, including derivational and inflectional morphemes. A language then is "synthetic" or "synthesizing" if it tends to have more than one morpheme per word, and a polysynthetic language is a language that has "many" morphemes per word. The concept was originally used only to describe those languages that can form long words that correspond to an entire sentence in English or other [[Indo-European languages]], and the word is still most frequently used to refer to such "sentence words".

Often polysynthesis is achieved when languages have extensive [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] between elements verbs and their arguments so that the verb is marked for agreement with the grammatical subject and object. In this way a single word can encode information about all the elements in a transitive clause. In Indo-European languages the verb is usually only marked for agreement with the subject (e.g. Spanish ''hablo'' "I speak" where the -o ending marks agreement with the first person singular subject), but in many languages verbs also agree with the object (e.g. the [[Swahili language|Kiswahili]] word ''nakupenda'' "I love you" where the ''n-'' prefix marks agreement with the first person singular subject and the ''ku''- prefix marks agreement with a second person singular object).

Many polysynthetic languages combine these two strategies, and also have ways of inflecting verbs for concepts normally encoded by adverbs or adjectives in Indo-European languages. In this way highly complex words can be formed, for example the [[Yupik language|Yupik]] word ''tuntussuqatarniksaitengqiggtuq'' which means "He had not yet said again that he was going to hunt reindeer." The word consists of the morphemes ''tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq'' with the meanings, reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative, and except for the morpheme ''tuntu'' "reindeer", none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Payne|1997|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to achieve a high degree of synthesis is when languages can form compound words by [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]] of nouns, so that entire words can be incorporated into the verb word, as ''baby'' is incorporated in the English verb ''babysit''.

Another common feature of polysynthetic languages is a tendency to use [[head-marking language|head marking]] as a means of syntactic cohesion. This means that many polysynthetic languages mark grammatical relations between verbs and their constituents by indexing the constituents on the verb with agreement morphemes, and the relation between noun phrases and their constituents by marking the head noun with agreement morphemes. There are some [[dependent-marking language]]s that may be considered to be polysynthetic because they use [[case stacking]] to achieve similar effects, and very long words.

===Examples===
An example from [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], a polysynthetic, [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporating]], and [[Agglutinative language|agglutinating language]] of Russia which also has [[grammatical case]]s unlike the majority of incorporating polysynthetic languages:

:''Təmeyŋəlevtpəγtərkən.''
:t-ə-meyŋ-ə-levt-pəγt-ə-rkən
:1.&lt;small&gt;[[Grammatical number#Types of number|SG]]&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;small&gt;[[Subject (grammar)|SUBJ]]&lt;/small&gt;-great-head-hurt-&lt;small&gt;[[Present tense|PRES]]&lt;/small&gt;.1
:'I have a fierce headache.' {{sfn|Skorik|1961|p=102}}

From Classical [[Ainu language|Ainu]] of Japan, another polysynthetic, incorporating, and agglutinating language:
: ''Usaopuspe aeyaykotuymasiramsuypa.''
:''usa-opuspe a-e-yay-ko-tuyma-si-ram-suy-pa''
:various-rumors 1&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;[[Applicative voice|APL]]&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;[[Reflexive verb|REFL]]&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;APL&lt;/small&gt;-far-&lt;small&gt;REFL&lt;/small&gt;-heart-sway-&lt;small&gt;[[Grammatical aspect|ITER]]&lt;/small&gt;
:'I wonder about various rumors.' &lt;small&gt;(lit. 'I keep swaying my heart afar and toward myself over various rumors'.)&lt;/small&gt;{{sfn|Shibatani|1990|p=72}}

The Mexican language [[Nahuatl]] is also considered to be polysynthetic, incorporating and agglutinating. The following [[verb]] shows how the verb is marked for [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[Patient (grammar)|patient]], [[Object (grammar)|object]], and indirect object:
:''Nimitztētlamaquiltīz''
:{{IPA|ni-mits-teː-tla-maki-ltiː-s}}'
:I-you-someone-something-give-&lt;small&gt;CAUSATIVE-FUTURE&lt;/small&gt;
:"I shall make somebody give something to you"{{sfn|Suárez|1983|p=61}}

The [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian language]] [[Tiwi language|Tiwi]] is also considered highly polysynthetic:
:''Pitiwuliyondjirrurlimpirrani''
:Pi-ti-wuliyondji-rrurlimpirr-ani.
:3PL-3SG.FEM-dead.wallaby-carry.on.shoulders-PST.HABIT
:"They would carry the dead wallaby on their shoulders."{{sfn|Blake|2006|p=591}}

And the [[Languages of Canada#Aboriginal languages|Canadian First Nation language]] [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]]:
:''Sahonwanhotónkwahse''
:sa-honwa-nhoton-kw-a-hse
:again-PAST-she/him-opendoor-reversive-un-for(PERF form)
:"she opened the door for him again"{{sfn|Rowicka|2006|p=194}}

An example from Western [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], an exclusively suffixing polysynthetic language:

:''Aliikkusersuillammassuaanerartassagaluarpaalli.''
:aliikku-sersu-i-llammas-sua-a-nerar-ta-ssa-galuar-paal-li
:entertainment-provide-&lt;small&gt;[[Transitive verb|SEMITRANS]]&lt;/small&gt;-one.good.at-&lt;small&gt;[[Copula (linguistics)|COP]]&lt;/small&gt;-say.that-&lt;small&gt;REP&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;[[Future tense|FUT]]&lt;/small&gt;-sure.but-3.&lt;small&gt;PL&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;small&gt;SUBJ&lt;/small&gt;/3&lt;small&gt;SG&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;small&gt;[[Object (grammar)|OBJ]]&lt;/small&gt;-but
:'However, they will say that he is a great entertainer, but ...'{{sfn|Evans|Sasse|2002|p=3}}

==History of the concept==

===Peter Stephen Du Ponceau on Native American languages===
The term "polysynthesis" was first used by [[Peter Stephen DuPonceau]] (a.k.a. Pierre Étienne Du Ponceau) in 1819 as a term to describe the structural characteristics of American languages:{{sfn|Duponceau|1819}}

{{quote|Three principal results have forcibly struck my mind... They are the following:
# That the American languages in general are rich in grammatical forms, and that in their complicated construction, the greatest order, method and regularity prevail
# That these complicated forms, which I call ''polysynthesis'', appear to exist in all those languages, from [[Greenland]] to [[Cape Horn]].
# That these forms appear to differ essentially from those of the ancient and modern languages of the old hemisphere.|(Duponceau 1819: xxii–xxiii)}}

{{quote|The manner in which words are compounded in that particular mode of speech, the great number and variety of ideas which it has the power of expressing in one single word; particularly by means of the verbs; all these stamp its character for abundance, strength, and comprehensiveness of expression, in such a manner, that those accidents must be considered as included in the general descriptive term ''polysynthetic''.|(Duponceau 1819:xxvii)}}

{{quote|I have explained elsewhere what I mean by a ''polysynthetic'' or ''syntactic'' construction of language.... It is that in which the greatest number of ideas are comprised in the least number of words. This is done principally in two ways. 1. By a mode of compounding locutions which is not confined to joining two words together, as in the Greek, or varying the inflection or termination of a radical word as in the most European languages, but by interweaving together the most significant sounds or syllables of each simple word, so as to form a compound that will awaken in the mind at once all the ideas singly expressed by the words from which they are taken. 2. By an analogous combination of various parts of speech, particularly by means of the verb, so that its various forms and inflections will express not only the principal action, but the greatest possible number of the moral ideas and physical objects connected with it, and will combine itself to the greatest extent with those conceptions which are the subject of other parts of speech, and in other languages require to be expressed by separate and distinct words.... Their most remarkable external appearance is that of long polysyllabic words, which being compounded in the manner I have stated, express much at once.|(Duponceau 1819: xxx–xxxi)}}

The term was made popular in a posthumously published work by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1836),{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=39}} and it was long considered that all the indigenous languages of the Americas were of the same type. Humboldt considered language structure to be an expression of the psychological stage of evolution of a people, and since Native Americans were considered uncivilized, polysynthesis came to be seen as the lowest stage of grammatical evolution, characterized by a lack of rigorous rules and clear organization known in European languages. Duponceau himself had argued that the complex polysynthetic nature of American languages was a relic of a more civilized past, and that this suggested that the Indians of his time had degenerated from a previous advanced stage. Duponceau's colleague [[Albert Gallatin]] contradicted this theory, arguing rather that synthesis was a sign of a lower cultural level, and that while the Greek and Latin languages were somewhat synthetic, Native American languages were much more so – and consequently polysynthesis was the hallmark of the lowest level of intellectual evolution.{{sfn|Bieder|1986|pp=29-34}}

This view was still prevalent when linguist [[William Dwight Whitney]] wrote in 1875. He considered polysynthesis to be a general characteristic of American languages, but he did qualify the statement by mentioning that certain languages such as [[Otomi language|Otomi]] and the [[Tupi-Guarani languages]] had been claimed to be basically analytic.{{sfn|Whitney|1908|pp=258–262}}

===D. G. Brinton ===

The ethnologist [[Daniel Garrison Brinton]], the first professor of anthropology in the US, followed Duponceau, Gallatin and Humboldt in seeing polysynthesis, which he distinguished from incorporation, as a defining feature of all the languages of the Americas.{{sfn|Brinton|1885|p=41}} He defined polysynthesis in this way:{{sfn|Brinton|1885|pp=14-15}}

{{quote|Polysynthesis is a method of word-building, applicable either to nominals or verbals, which not only employs juxtaposition, with aphaeresis, syncope,
apocope, etc., but also words, forms of words, and significant phonetic elements which have no separate existence apart from such compounds. This latter peculiarity marks it off altogether from the processes of agglutination and collocation.|Brinton, 1885:14,15)}}

{{quote|Their absence has not been demonstrated in any [language] of which we have sufficient and authentic material on which to base a decision. The opinion of Du Ponceau and Humboldt, therefore, that these processes belong to the ground-plan of American languages, and are their leading characteristics, must be regarded as still uncontroverted in any instance.|Brinton 1885:41}}

In the 1890s the question of whether polysynthesis could be considered a general characteristic of Native American languages became a hotly contested issue as Brinton debated the question with [[John Napoleon Brinton Hewitt|John Hewitt]]. Brinton, who had never done fieldwork with any indigenous group continued to defend Humboldt and Duponceau's view of the exceptional nature of American languages against the claim of Hewitt, who was half [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] and had studied the Iroquoian languages, that languages such as the Iroquois had grammatical rules and verbs just like European languages.

===Edward Sapir's morphological types===
[[Edward Sapir]] reacted to the prevailing view in Americanist linguistics which considered the languages of the Americas to belong to a single basic polysynthetic type, arguing instead that American indigenous languages were highly diverse and encompassed all known morphological types.{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=39}} He also built on the work of [[Leonard Bloomfield]] who in his 1914 work "language" dismissed morphological typology, stating specifically that the term polysynthetic had never been clearly defined.{{sfn|Bloomfield|1995|p=208}}

In Sapir's 1921 book also titled "Language", he argued that instead of using the morphological types as a strict classification scheme it made more sense to classify languages as relatively more or less synthetic or analytic, with the isolating and polysynthetic languages in each of the extremes of that spectrum. He also argued that languages were rarely purely of one morphological type, but used different morphological strategies in different parts of the grammar. {{sfn|Sapir|1921}}

{{quote| Hence has arisen the still popular classification of languages into an “isolating” group, an “agglutinative” group, and an “inflective” group. Sometimes the languages of the American Indians are made to straggle along as an uncomfortable “polysynthetic” rear-guard to the agglutinative languages. There is justification for the use of all of these terms, though not perhaps in quite the spirit in which they are commonly employed. In any case it is very difficult to assign all known languages to one or other of these groups, the more so as they are not mutually exclusive. A language may be both agglutinative and inflective, or inflective and polysynthetic, or even polysynthetic and isolating, as we shall see a little later on.|Sapir, 1921}}

{{quote|An analytic language is one that either does not combine concepts into single words at all (Chinese) or does so economically (English, French). In an analytic language the sentence is always of prime importance, the word is of minor interest. In a synthetic language (Latin, Arabic, Finnish) the concepts cluster more thickly, the words are more richly chambered, but there is a tendency, on the whole, to keep the range of concrete significance in the single word down to a moderate compass. A polysynthetic language, as its name implies, is more than ordinarily synthetic. The elaboration of the word is extreme. Concepts which we should never dream of treating in a subordinate fashion are symbolized by derivational affixes or “symbolic” changes in the radical element, while the more abstract notions, including the syntactic relations, may also be conveyed by the word. A polysynthetic language illustrates no principles that are not already exemplified in the more familiar synthetic languages. It is related to them very much as a synthetic language is related to our own analytic English. The three terms are purely quantitative—and relative, that is, a language may be “analytic” from one standpoint, “synthetic” from another. I believe the terms are more useful in defining certain drifts than as absolute counters. It is often illuminating to point out that a language has been becoming more and more analytic in the course of its history or that it shows signs of having crystallized from a simple analytic base into a highly synthetic form.|Sapir, 1921}}

Sapir introduced a number of other distinctions according to which languages could be morphologically classified, and proposed combining them to form more complex classifications. He proposed classifying languages both by the degree of synthesis, classifying languages as either analytic, synthetic or polysynthetic, and by the technique used to achieve synthesis, classifying languages as agglutinative, fusional, or symbolic. Among the examples of polysynthetic languages he gave was [[Haida language|Haida]] which he considered to use the agglutinative-isolating technique, [[Yana language|Yana]] and [[Nootka language|Nootka]] both of which he considered agglutinative, [[Chinook language|Chinook]] and [[Algonkin language|Algonkin]] which he considered fusional. The [[Siouan languages]] he considered "mildly polysynthetic" and agglutinative-fusional.{{sfn|Sapir|1921|pp=150–51}}

Following Sapir's understanding of Polysynthesis, his student [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] proposed a distinction between [[oligosynthetic]] and polysynthetic languages, where the former term was applied to languages with a very small number of morphemes of which all other lexical units are composed. No language has been shown to fit the description of an oligosynthetic language and the concept is not in general use in linguistics.

==Contemporary approaches==

===Generative approaches===
The sentence structure of polysynthetic languages has been taken as a challenge for linguists working within [[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[Generative linguistics|generative]] theoretical framework that operates with the assumption that all the world's languages share a set of basic syntactic principles.

====Non-configurationality and the pronominal argument hypothesis====
[[Eloise Jelinek]], having worked with [[Salishan languages|Salishan]] and [[Athabascan languages]], proposed an analysis of polysynthetic languages in which the morphemes that agree with the arguments of the verb are not just considered indexes of the arguments, but in fact constitute the primary expression of the arguments within the sentence.{{sfn|Jelinek|1984}} Because this theory posits that the pronominal agreement morphemes are the true syntactic arguments of the sentence, Jelinek's hypothesis was called the [[pronominal argument hypothesis]]. If the hypothesis were correct, it would mean that free standing nouns in such languages did not constitute syntactical arguments, but simply adjoined specifiers or adjuncts. This in turn explained why many polysynthetic languages seem to be [[non-configurational languages|non-configurational]], i.e. they have no strict rules for word order and seemingly violate many of the basic rules for syntactic structures posited within the generative framework.{{sfn|Hale|2003}}

====Mark C. Baker's polysynthesis parameter====
In 1996 [[Mark Baker (linguist)|Mark C. Baker]] proposed a definition of polysynthesis as a syntactic macroparameter within [[Noam Chomsky]]'s "[[principles and parameters]]" program. He defines polysynthetic languages as languages that conform to the syntactic rule that he calls the "polysynthesis parameter", and that as a result show a special set of morphological and syntactic properties. The polysynthesis parameter states that all phrasal heads must be marked with either agreement morphemes of their direct argument or else [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporate]] these arguments in that head.{{sfn|Baker|1996}} This definition of polysynthesis leaves out some languages that are commonly stated as examples of polysynthetic languages (such as [[Inuktitut language|Inuktitut]]), but can be seen as the reason for certain common structural properties in others, such as [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]] and [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]]. Baker's definition, probably because of its heavy dependence on generative theory, has not been accepted{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} as a general definition of polysynthesis.

===Johanna Mattissen's affixal and compositional subtypes===
[[Johanna Mattissen]] suggests that polysynthetic languages can be fundamentally divided into two typological categories, which differ in the way morphemes are organised to form words. She calls the two types for affixal and compositional polysynthesis respectively.

====Affixal====
Affixally polysynthetic languages, as the name suggests, are those that use only non-root-[[bound morpheme]]s to express concepts that in less synthetic languages are expressed by separate words such as [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s. They also use these bound morphemes to make other [[noun]]s and [[verb]]s from a basic root, which can lead to very complex word forms without non-lexical suffixes. These bound morphemes often relate to body parts, other essential items of the culture of the language's speakers or features of the landscape where the language is spoken. Deictics and other spatial and temporal relations are also very common among these bound morphemes in affixally polysynthetic languages.{{sfn|Mattissen|2003|p=281}}

Affixally polysynthetic languages do not use noun incorporation or verb serialisation, since this violates the rule concerning the number of roots allowable per word. Many make a weak distinction between nouns and verbs, which allows using affixes to translate these parts of speech.{{sfn|Mattissen|2003|p=315}}

Affixally polysynthetic languages may have a word structure that is either
* '''templatic''', with a fixed number of slots for different elements, which are fixed in their position and order relative to each other;{{sfn|Mattissen|2003|p=286}} or
* '''scope ordered''', with forms not restricted in complexity and length. The components are fixed in their relative ''scope'' and are thus ordered according to the intended meaning. Usually in this case a few components ''are'' actually fixed, such as the root in [[Eskimo–Aleut languages]].{{sfn|Mattissen|2003|p=287}}

Examples of affixally polysynthetic languages include [[Inuktitut]], [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]], [[Athabaskan languages]], the [[Chimakuan languages]] ([[Quileute language|Quileute]]) and the [[Wakashan languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Andronis, Mary; Chicago Linguistic Society #38; p. 386. {{ISBN|0-914203-63-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Compositional====
In compositionally polysynthetic languages, there usually can be more than one [[free morpheme]] per word, which gives rise to noun incorporation and [[verb serialisation]] to create extremely long words.{{sfn|Mattissen|2003|pp=281–290}}  Bound affixes, though less important in compositionally polysynthetic languages than in affixally polysynthetic languages, tend to be equally abundant in both types.

It is believed that all affixally polysynthetic languages evolved from compositionally polysynthetic ones via the conversion of morphemes that could stand on their own into affixes.&lt;ref&gt;See Mattissen: "On the Ontology and Diachronisis of Polysynthesis"; in Wunderlich (editor): ''Advances in the theory of the lexicon'', p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Because they possess a greater number of free morphemes, compositionally polysynthetic languages are much more prone than affixally polysynthetic ones to evolve into simpler languages with less complex words. On the other hand, they are generally easier to distinguish from non-polysynthetic languages than affixally polysynthetic languages.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Examples of compositionally polysynthetic languages include Classical [[Ainu language|Ainu]]{{Dubious|date=December 2014}} , [[Sora language|Sora]], [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]], [[Tonkawa language|Tonkawa]], and most [[Amazonian languages]].{{sfn|Mattissen|2003|pp=281–290}}

'''Kuppali Puttappa Poornachandra Tejaswi''' (8 September 1938 – 5 April 2007&lt;ref name="deathdate"/&gt;) was a prominent [[Kannada]] writer, novelist, photographer,  publisher, painter, naturalist, and environmentalist who made a great impression in the "Navya" period of [[Kannada literature|Kannada Literature]] and inaugurated the ''Bandaaya'' ("Protest Literature") with his short-story collection ''Abachoorina Post Offisu''.

At early stages of his writing career, Tejaswi wrote poems but later concentrated on [[Short story|short stories]], novels and essays. Poornachandra Tejaswi has a distinguished style of writing which has heralded a new era in [[Kannada literature|Kannada Literature]].&lt;ref name="tejaswi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2007/04/13/stories/2007041301730100.htm |title= Flights of fancy |work=Online webpage of The Hindu|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Tejaswi was born on 8 September 1938 in [[Kuppali]] in [[Shimoga district]] of [[Karnataka]]. Although he was the son of "Raashtrakavi" [[Kuvempu]], he came out of his father's shadow and established his own image at an early age. Tejaswi received best story award in the competition held by Prajavani Kannada newspaper on the occasion of Deepavali, for his first short story "Linga Banda", a look at the rainy [[Western Ghats]] from the eye of a boy. After completion of his education from [[Maharaja College of Mysore]], one among the top colleges in India, due to his interests in nature and farming, he moved to [[Mudigere]] taluk of [[Chikmagalur District]] after buying a coffee estate. Apart from literature he was actively involved in painting, photography and philosophy.

He was a keen learner of nature and his favourite pastime was to roam around in the forests of western ghats. He died of cardiac arrest at his farm house Niruttara, [[Mudigere]] in [[Chikmagalur district]] of [[Karnataka]] state, on 5 April 2007 approximately at 2.00 p.m.&lt;ref name="deathdate"/&gt; He was 69 at the time. He has 2 daughters Susmitha and Eshanye who are software professionals. His wife Rajeshwari stays in Niruttara,Mudigere.

==Literary Works==
Tejaswi has written in almost all forms of literature including poems, [[Short story|short stories]], novels, [[travel literature]], plays and science fiction. [[Nature]] and incidents related to nature enjoy major roles in most of his works. One of the most popular writers in Kannada, Tejaswi's works have continued to remain popular, going into multiple prints and often topping reader's charts.&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Tejaswi's first novel set to see the light of day|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/article3751318.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|date=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Karvalo]]'' is one such novel where the author participates in an adventure of discovering a flying lizard in the dense forests of [[Western Ghats]].

Tejaswi has translated a number of English books to [[Kannada]] enriching the depth of [[Kannada literature]]. His famous translations include the series on [[Kenneth Anderson (writer)|Kenneth Anderson's]] hunting expeditions and [[Henri Charrière]]'s ''[[Papillon (book)|Papillon]]''.

Tejaswi wrote his first novel, ''Kaadu Mattu Kraurya'', when he was a 24-year-old in 1962. The novel is expected to be in print for the first time towards the end of 2012. He had initially planned to name this work ''Nalini'' but later decided to go by its present title. Tejaswi was inspired to write the novel after visiting his wife Rajeshwari's maternal home in the forested [[Malnad|Malnad region]] of Karnataka. The novel, whose manuscript was prepared by Rajeshwari, is the story of Linga, a migrant bonded labourer from north Karnataka who moves to a remote Malnad village where he struggles to cope with his new life and surroundings.&lt;ref name="thehindu" /&gt;

==Trivia==
* Tejaswi heralded a new wave, when he (with like-minded friends) compiled [[Kuvempu]]'s ''[[Sri Ramayana Darshanam]]'' in Kuvempu's handwriting. The [[Government of Karnataka]] aided the effort with grants, but the cost of the book was high and ended up with mediocre success.
* A controversy started in early 2004 demanding inducting [[Madhwacharya]]'s name in ''[[Jaya Bharata Jananiya Tanujate]]'', written by [[Kuvempu]]. Tejaswi, as son of Kuvempu and holder of copyrights of Kuvempu's articles, strongly criticised any attempts to change the poem.
* While some intellectuals condemned the daubing incident of Belgaum Mayor Vijay More's face with black paint on 11 November 2005, Tejaswi rhetorically asked if More deserved [[Fair &amp; Lovely (cosmetics)|Fair &amp; Lovely]] instead.
* Tejaswi had a great appetite and was known for his fondness for good food.

[[File:British 1997 Great Tudor Presentation Pack.jpg|thumbnail|right|A British Presentation Pack from 1997 for the Great Tudor issue commemorating Henry VIII]]
A '''Presentation Pack''' typically contains a full set of a new [[postage stamp|stamp]] issue, produced for [[philatelist]]s and [[stamp collector]]s.  It normally comprises a folded card containing detailed notes about the stamps, a card with clear strips for holding the actual stamps, all held within a clear sleeve. The packs are usually sold at a price a little above the stamps' face value.

== History ==
Great Britain was one of the first countries to produce Commemorative Presentation Packs, with the first Presentation Packs being issued by the General Post Office in 1960, when the GPO was looking for a convenient way of packaging and selling sets of stamps for the London 1960 International Stamp Exhibition, held
at the Royal Festival Hall. They produced four packs priced in pounds sterling for the exhibition, and another four priced in US dollars for a Post Office sales tour of the USA. Each pack was fairly basic in design and the only information printed on the pack was a brief description of the stamps and the retail price. These first Presentation Packs were produced in very limited numbers and are now commonly known as Forerunners.

It was in 1964 that the first Commemorative Packs were produced by the GPO. On 23 April, the first ‘proper’ pack was issued for a set of stamps celebrating the Shakespeare Festival, to mark the 400th Anniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare. The Presentation Pack was decorative in design and contained information on the stamp designs, the designer and the stamp printer. Early packs were not produced in large numbers and are highly sought after by collectors. The pack for the "Opening of the Forth Road Bridge" stamps has a book price of £400 according to the 2010 [[Stanley Gibbons]] "Great Britain Concise Stamp Catalogue", though they sell on the open market for considerably less!  The early packs issued in the 1960s had tight cellophane sleeves causing some to shrink, in turn leading to buckling of the information cards.

The Post Office viewed the Presentation Pack as a sales tool to attract new customers and impulse buyers. They also developed the range to encourage stamp collecting in other countries, particularly Germany and Japan, by printing packs in those languages.

Many countries around the world ([[Australia Post|Australia]] etc..) now issue Presentation Packs in similar formats, being a convenient way to sell and display a whole stamp issue.

== Categories of British Presentation Packs==
[[File:Royal Mail Penny Black facsimile presentation pack 2000.jpg|thumbnail|right|The pack for the facsimile [[Penny Black]]s produced by [[Royal Mail]] for a 2000 stamp exhibition (PPR1)]]
Since the first Commemorative Presentation Pack in 1964, there has been an increasing variety of British Presentation Packs released each year.  The Presentation Packs have a wide range of subject matter which can be divided into the following categories:

''Commemorative Packs'' - The most frequently produced and popular packs amongst collectors. They are released by the Royal Mail on the day that the stamps are issued and contain an information card to provide details and images relating to the theme of the stamps. The design of Commemorative Packs continually evolve, with many now containing a stamp Miniature Sheet displayed on the front, or on the reverse. Two Commemorative Packs have been specifically translated into Welsh. The first, the 1969 Investiture of The Prince of Wales, was given to the school children of Wales. The second pack was issued in 1998 for Diana, Princess of Wales, which has proved very popular with collectors.

''Definitive Packs'' -  These packs provide information on the background to Definitive and Country stamps issued by the Royal Mail. The first Definitive Packs were issued on 5 March 1969 - one pack of low value pre-decimal Machin stamps and the other with high value pre-decimal Machin stamps.

''Collectors Club Packs'' - The Collectors Club was set up to promote stamp collecting for children, as a family activity. It became one of the largest clubs of its kind with 70,000 members worldwide. Only three Presentation Packs were issued specifically for the Collectors Club and they are now difficult to obtain.

''Forerunner Packs'' - Packs known as Forerunners are considered by many to be the first Presentation Packs issued. They were the inspiration of Frank Langfield, who was developing the philatelic retail department of the General Post Office by promoting stamps to the UK and USA. They were first sold in July 1960 at the International Stamp Exhibition held at Festival Hall, London.

''Format Packs'' - These stamp Format Packs were specialist products issued by the Royal Mail and contained gutter pairs, cylinder blocks, traffic lights or top left corner of the selvedge of certain stamp issues within a sealed cellophane cover. They were sold at face value, available from the Philatelic Bulletin and selected Post Offices.

''Greetings Packs'' - Greeting stamps were produced in booklet format. They were first available within a 1992 Presentation Pack. Each pack contained ten 1st Class stamps along with the corresponding labels. Altogether, from 1992 to 1997, six different Greeting Packs were produced.

''Miniature Sheet Collection Packs'' - The first Miniature Sheet Collection Pack was issued in 2005. Presented in a durable plastic folder.  It contained a complete set of the year's miniature sheets with an accompanying information card.

''Postage Due (To Pay) Packs'' -  Four Presentation Packs were issued by the Post Office containing Postage Due (To Pay) labels - the first in 1971 and the last in 1994. All the packs contained information on the background of 'To Pay' labels, which were introduced to Great Britain in 1914.

''Post &amp; Go Packs'' - Post &amp; Go Packs were introduced in 2009 and have proved popular with collectors. Originally, these packs did not carry premium pricing as they consisted only of self-adhesive stamps on a simple carrier and information card. Royal Mail continues to issue these packs throughout the year, focussing on a specific theme.

''Reproduction Packs'' - These packs are produced to commemorate special British stamps. The first was issued in 2000 to celebrate the Penny Black. Significant attention to detail goes into the production of these packs, a source of admiration to collectors. For example, the Postal Union Congress London 1929 Reproduction Pack contained stamps produced using the original die but with a watermark effect on the reverse and the word 'facsimile', to clearly distinguish them from the originals.

''Smilers for Kids'' - These packs were launched by the Post Office on 28 October 2008 with four designs featuring well known children's book characters; Peter Rabbit, Almond Blossom, Mr Happy and Noddy. These special packs were created to appeal to children and contained ten self-adhesive 1st Class stamps on a sheet, plus corresponding labels. Also included in the packs were other items, such as 'New Baby' announcement cards or cut-out masks.

''Year Books'' - These books were introduced in 1984 by the Post Office as a luxury item. They are hardback books contained within a rigid sleeve for protection. Each book contains an illustrated chapter on every stamp issue for that year, with a full set of the stamps for the collector to place into slip-in mounts on the appropriate pages. In 1995, the Post Office introduced leather-bound Year Books in limited editions.

''Year Packs'' - These are also known as Gift Packs and Collectors' Packs. The first Year Pack, originally called Gift Pack, was issued at the end of 1967 and contained the stamps for that year. The Royal cypher, embossed in gold on the cover of the pack made this a striking new addition to the GPO product range. In 1968, a Gift Pack was produced containing the commemorative stamps issued between January and August that year. Strangely, the GPO also created a Collectors' Pack, which contained selected stamp issues from 1967 and 1968. From 1969 to 1971, they continued to produce Collectors' Packs containing selected stamps from two years. However, since 1972 packs have been issued with only one year's stamps. The name changed to Year Pack in 1994.

''Souvenir and Special Edition Packs'' - This category contains a wide range of packs varying in style, content and size. They are all produced by Royal Mail; some were distributed by third parties. The first Special Edition Pack was issued in 1969 when the British Ships Commemorative Pack was reprinted for sale on board the Cunard Line Queen Elizabeth II cruise ship. The original pack had noted that the Queen Elizabeth II 'sailed on her maiden voyage to New York on 17 January 1969.' However, the sailing was delayed so Cunard commissioned a reprint with corrected text reading 'sails on her maiden voyage early in 1969.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packsandcards.com/products/showitem.asp?ID=2369&amp;start=1 Packs and Cards: British Ships (Cunard) Special Edition Pack 1969.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527211642/http://www.packsandcards.com/products/showitem.asp?ID=2369&amp;start=1 |date=2014-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Private Packs'' - Over the years, a number of individuals and organisations have produced Private Packs featuring specific Royal Mail stamp issues. Examples of Private Packs include Post Office Missed (also known as POM), Bournemouth and Norwich Packs. Most of these packs are produced by the philatelic departments of national post offices. However, there is nothing to stop anyone from producing a pack by taking a set of stamps and designing their own holder. A number of ''private packs'' have been created in Britain to promote products, events, or simply as souvenirs including British Caledonian Airways for the Queen's Silver Jubilee in 1977&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packsandcards.com/products/showitem.asp?ID=1369&amp;start=1 Packs and Cards: British Caledonian Airways, Queen's Silver Jubilee 1977.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715032400/http://www.packsandcards.com/products/showitem.asp?ID=1369&amp;start=1 |date=2011-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Scottish Wildlife Trust for the 1981 British Butterflies stamps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packsandcards.com/products/showitem.asp?ID=1360&amp;start=1 Packs and Cards: Scottish Wildlife Trust, British Butterflies 1981.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007175239/http://www.packsandcards.com/products/showitem.asp?ID=1360&amp;start=1 |date=2011-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more recent Private Pack was produced by the National Assembly of Wales in 2006, for distribution to its members. The pack contained a 2006 Celebrating Wales Miniature Sheet and a specially designed information card detailing the history of the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.packsandcards.com/products/showitem.asp?ID=5065&amp;start=1 Packs and Cards: National Assembly for Wales 2006.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528005239/http://www.packsandcards.com/products/showitem.asp?ID=5065&amp;start=1 |date=2014-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Retrat de Prudenci Bertrana.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Prudenci Bertrana]] 

'''Prudenci Bertrana i Comte''' ({{IPA-ca|pɾuˈðɛnsi βəɾˈtɾanə}}; [[Tordera]], 1867 - [[Barcelona]], 1941) was an important [[Modernisme|modernist]] writer in [[Catalan language|Catalan]].

==Biography==
During his youth, he studied at [[Girona]]; some years after he went to Barcelona to study an industrial engineering course, city in which he definitely instatled on 1911, where he managed known magazines as ''[[L'Esquella de la Torratxa]]'' or ''[[La Campana de Gràcia]]''. He worked as a journalist and also taught art there. Bertrana also collaborated with other newspapers such as ''[[El Poble Català]]'', ''[[La Publicitat]]'', ''[[Revista de Catalunya]]'' and ''[[La Veu de Catalunya]]''.

His style is certainly distinguished in relation to the fashions of the moment. He is quite known because of his novel ''Josafat'' (1906), the book with which began his literary production, and also for his storybook ''Proses bàrbares'' (Barbain prose, 1911). He published his first stories in 1903, and some of them have been considered of an excellent quality. His works (specially short stories) are based onto three principal aspects: the landscape, the peasants and the animals. Bertrana's novels, structured from a careful and detailed observation of the world, parts from life experience itself, seen by a human and a writer at a time. It is, however, with the trilogy ''Entre la terra i els núvols'' (Between the Earth and the Clouds), formed by ''L'hereu'' (The heir, 1931), ''El vagabund'' (The vagrant, 1933) i ''L'impenitent'' (The unrepentant, 1948), where and autobiographic purpose is mostly reflected, based on the personal frustration, the hardest part of what was the death of three of his sons. His daughter Aurora's long memories (who dedicated her life to literature too), contain many references to his father.

'''Richard Gendall''' was a [[United Kingdom|British]] expert on the [[Cornish language]], born in 1924, died September 2017 aged 93&lt;ref&gt;''Observer'' online -  Sunday 31 July 2005: "How do you say 'bugger off' in Cornish?" by Jonathan Sale: "And he [Gendall] ought to know, having started learning the language in 1928 at the age of four and is now a linguistically vigorous 81."&lt;/ref&gt; He was the founder of "[[Modern Cornish]]"/''Curnoack Nowedga'', which split off during the 1980s. Whereas [[Ken George]] mainly went to Medieval Cornish as the inspiration for his revival, Gendall went to the last surviving records of Cornish, such as [[John Boson (writer)|John]] and [[Nicholas Boson]], in the eighteenth-century. He was involved with [[University of Exeter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DEATH OF RICHARD GENDALL|url=http://news.bitesizecornish.co.uk/mernans-richard-gendall-death-of-richard-gendall/|publisher=Bite Size Cornish|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a folk musician, and made several recordings with [[Brenda Wootton]], as well as a poet in writer in Cornish itself under the [[bardic name]] of "Gelvinak".

Gendall founded '''Teere ha Tavaz''', an organisation which seeks to promote the Cornish language in its ''Modern Cornish'' or ''Curnoack Nowedga'' variety. It is also a small publisher on, and in, the Cornish language.

The '''Sama–Bajaw languages''' are a well established group of languages spoken by the [[Sama-Bajau|Bajau and Sama peoples]] of the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]. They are mainly spoken on [[Borneo]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]] between Borneo and [[Mindanao]].

==Languages==
Grimes (2003) identifies nine Sama–Bajaw languages. 
#[[Balangingi language|Balangingi]] (Bangingi'; Northern Sama)
#Central [[Sama language|Sama]] (Siasa Sama)
#Southern Sama (Sinama)
#[[Pangutaran Sama language|Pangutaran Sama]]
#[[Mapun language|Mapun]] (Kagayan)
#[[Yakan language|Yakan]]
#[[Abaknon language|Abaknon]] (Inabaknon)
#[[Indonesian Bajau language|Indonesian Bajau]]
#[[West Coast Bajau language|West Coast Bajau]]

The first six are spoken in the Sulu region of the Southern Philippines. Indonesian Bajaw is spoken mainly in [[Sulawesi]] and West Coast Bajaw in [[Sabah]], Borneo. Several dialects of the languages can be identified.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A grammar of West Coast Bajau|last = Miller|first = Mark|publisher = |year = 2007|isbn = 9780549145219|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blust (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Blust, Robert. 2006. 'The linguistic macrohistory of the Philippines'. In Liao &amp; Rubino, eds, ''Current Issues in Philippine Linguistics and Anthropology''. pp 31–68.&lt;/ref&gt; states that lexical evidence indicates that Sama–Bajaw originated in the [[Barito River|Barito]] region of southeast Borneo, though not from any established group of [[Barito languages]]. ''Ethnologue'' has followed, calling the resulting group 'Greater Barito'.

==Classification==
Pallesen (1985:18) classifies the Sama-Bajaw languages as follows.

*'''Sama-Bajaw'''
**''[[Abaknon language|Abaknon]]''
**''[[Yakan language|Yakan]]'': Northern Yakan, Southern Yakan
**Sibuguey (''[[Sama language|Sama]] Batuan'')
**Sulu-Borneo
***''Western Sulu'': [[Sama language|Sama]] Pangutaran, Sama Ubian
***Inner Sulu

== Grammar ==

=== Voice ===
Western Austronesian languages are characterised by symmetrical [[Voice (grammar)|voice]] alternations. These diﬀer from asymmetrical voice alternations, such as active and passive, since the voices can be considered equally transitive.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelmann, Nikolaus P. 2005. The Austronesian Languages of Asia and Madagascar: Typological Charactersistics. In A. Adelaar and N. P. Himmelmann (eds.) ''The Austronesian Languages of Asia and Madagascar'', 110-181. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the terms Actor Voice and Undergoer Voice are sometimes used. 
* Actor Voice (AV) refers to the construction in which the actor or agent-like argument is mapped to subject. 
* Undergoer Voice (UV) refers to the construction in which the undergoer or patient-like argument is mapped to subject. 
The voice construction is signalled through morphological marking on the verb.

Western Austronesian languages are typically subdivided into Philippine-type and Indonesian-type languages on the basis of the voice system:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The many faces of Austronesian voice systems: some new empirical studies|last = Arka|first = I. Wayan|publisher = Pacific Linguistics|year = 2005|isbn = 0 85883 556 8|location = |pages = |last2 = Ross|first2 = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-

|[[Case marking]] of nominal arguments

|}
The voice alternations in Sama–Bajaw languages have some characteristics of Philippine-type languages and some characteristics of Indonesian-type languages.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Miller (2014) says that there are three main voice alternations in Sama-Bajaw:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Miller, Mark. 2014. 'A comparative look at the major voice oppositions in Sama-Bajau languages and Indonesian/Malay. In Wayan Arka and N. L. K. Mas Indrawati (eds.) ''Argument realisations and related constructions in Austronesian languages'', 303-312. Canberra: Asia-Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An Actor Voice (AV) construction marked with a nasal prefix
* A transitive non-AV construction with the bare verb
* Another non-AV construction with morphological marking on the verb and case marking on the agent
In many Philippine languages, the UV construction is said to be basic. This has led people to analyse the languages as [[Ergative–absolutive language|syntactically ergative]].&lt;ref&gt;Aldridge, Edith. 2004. Ergativity and Word Order in Austronesian Languages. Ph.D. dissertation, Cornell University.&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis has been proposed for Sama Southern (Trick 2006);&lt;ref&gt;Trick, Douglas. 2006. ‘Ergative control of syntactic processes in Sama Southern’. Paper presented at Tenth International Conference on Austronesian Linguistics. January 2006. Puerto Princesa City, Palawan, Philippines&lt;/ref&gt; Yakan (Brainard &amp; Behrens 2002);&lt;ref&gt;Brainard, Sherri and Dietlinde Behrens. 2002. ''A Grammar of Yakan''. Manila: Linguistic Society of the Philippines, No. 40, Vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Sama Bangingi’ (Gault 1999)&lt;ref&gt;Gault, JoAnn Marie. 1999. An ergative description of Sama Bangingi’. Manila: Linguistic Society of the Philippines.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sama Pangutaran (Walton 1986).&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Charles. 1986. ''Sama verbal semantics: classification, derivation and inflection''. Manila: Linguistic Society of the Philippines&lt;/ref&gt; These languages are said to have Philippine-type voice systems.

West Coast Bajau, however, is said to have an Indonesian-type voice system because there are two [[Transitive verb|transitive]] voices; a true passive construction (''-in-'') and an applicative suffix (''-an'').&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This makes West Coast Bajau more similar to the languages of [[Sarawak]] and [[Kalimantan]] than the other languages of Sabah.&lt;ref&gt;Clayre, Beatrice. 1996. The changing face of focus in the languages of Borneo. In H. Steinhauer (ed.) ''Papers in Austronesian Linguistics'' No. 3, 51-88. Canberra: Pacific Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indonesian Bajau also has an Indonesian-type voice system as illustrated below:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bajau: A Symmetrical Austronesian Language on JSTOR|jstor = 416102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some Sama-Bajau languages there are restrictions on how the non-AV actor is realised. For example, in Sama Bangingi’ the non-AV actor is typically a pronominal [[clitic]] in first or second person.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The voice alternations in Sama-Bajau languages can also be accompanied by a change in the [[Case marking|case-marking]] of pronouns and a change in [[Word order|word-order]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Case Marking ===
Sama-Bajau languages do not have case-marking on nominal arguments.

Nonetheless, pronouns have diﬀerent forms depending on their [[grammatical function]]. Like the languages of Sarawak,&lt;ref&gt;Clayre, Beatrice. 2014. ‘A preliminary typology of the languages of Middle Borneo’. In Peter Sercombe, Michael Boutin &amp; Adrian Clynes (eds.) ''Advances in research on cultural and linguistic practices in Borneo,'' 123-151. Phillips, Maine USA: Borneo Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; West Coast Bajau has two different pronoun sets&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''Set 1:''' non-subject actors
* '''Set 2:''' all other pronouns
In contrast, most of the languages of Sabah have three sets of pronouns:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''Set 1:''' non-subject actors
* '''Set 2:''' subjects
* '''Set 3:''' non-subject, non-actors
In West Coast Bajau, the non-subject undergoer can be optionally realised using both the Set 1 and the Set 2 pronouns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Zero anaphora]] is possible for highly topical arguments, except the UV actor, which cannot be deleted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is common across Western Austronesian languages.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelmann, Nikolaus P. 1999. ‘The lack of zero anaphora and incipient person marking in Tagalog’. ''Oceanic Linguistics'' 38 (2): 231-269&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Word Order ===
Like the languages of the Philippines, the Sama–Bajaw languages in the Sulu tend to be [[Verb-initial word order|verb-initial]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, in most languages word order is flexible and depends on the voice construction. In the Sulu, SVO is only found in the context of preposed [[Affirmative and negative|negatives]] and [[Aspect (linguistics)|aspect markers]]. In West Coast Bajau, on the other hand, SVO word-order is also found in pragmatically neutral contexts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This, again, makes West Coast Bajau more similar to the languages of Sarawak, than the other languages of the Sama-Bajaw group.

Verheijen (1986) suggests that the Bajau language spoken in the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] has no fixed position of the subject but is fixed VO. The language has several properties that are said to correlate with VO word-order:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Sama/Bajau Language in the Lesser Sunda Islands|last = Verheijen|first = Jilis|publisher = Pacific Linguistics|year = 1986|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Prepositions
* Noun‑Genitive
* Noun-Relative
* Noun-Adjective
* Noun-Demonstrative
* Preverbal negatives
* Initial subordinators
The preferred word-orders for five Sama-Bajau languages are shown below. The word order is represented in terms of the semantic roles: actor (A) and undergoer (U).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
!
!AV Word Order
!Zero UV Word Order
!Affixed Non-AV Word Order
|-
|Sama Bangingi'
|V A U
|
|
|-
|Central Sama
|V A U (if A = pronoun)
V U A (if A = full noun)
|V A U
|V U A or V A U
|-
|Southern Sama
|V A U (if A = pronoun)
V U A (if A = full noun)
|V A U
|V U A (V A U also possible)
|-
|Pangutaran Sama
|V A U
|V A U
|V A U or V U A
|-
|West Coast Bajau
|A V U
|V A U or U V A
|U V A (less often V A U)
|}
In all Sama-Bajau languages, the position of the actor is fixed, directly following the verb in the zero UV construction. Elsewhere, the order of actor and undergoer depends on the [[animacy]] of the arguments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This could be seen to follow the Philippine tendency to place actors first in the clause.&lt;ref&gt;Billings, Loren. 2005. Ordering clitics and postverbal R-expressions in Tagalog: a unified  analysis? In Andrew Carnie, Heidi Harley &amp; Sheila Ann Dooley (eds.) ''Verb First: on the syntax of verb-initial languages'', 303-339. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

If we rephrase these orders in terms of grammatical function, a number of Sama-Bajau languages could be said to be VOS languages. S is equivalent to the actor in AV and the undergoer in UV. O is equivalent to the non-subject core argument.

==== Word Order and Information Structure ====
Variant word-orders are permitted in Sama-Bajau languages. The different word-orders have different [[information structure]] interpretations. This differs depending on the voice of the clause.

Miller (2007) suggests that verb-initial order in West Coast Bajau UV clauses strongly correlates with foregrounding.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He argues that this is the basic word order given that the undergoer in final position does not have a specific pragmatic status. In contrast, fronted undergoers are highly active and accessible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both SVO and VOS orders occur with equal frequency in narrative texts, though VOS is highly preferred in foregrounded clauses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

AV clauses are predominantly subject-initial regardless of grounding.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In fact, SVO is the only word-order permitted in subordinate clauses. Where verb-initial clauses in AV do occur, however, they typically represent key sequences of action in the storyline.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are also [[Specificity (linguistics)|specificity]] effects in AV verb-initial word order. VOS is acceptable when the non-subject undergoer is non-specific, but sometimes considered unacceptable if the undergoer is specific.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The same is true for [[Definiteness|definite]] undergoers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the effects are not found when the word-order is VSO and the undergoer is in final position. In this case, the structure is grammatical regardless of whether the undergoer is definite/specific or not.

==== Topic and Focus ====
In West Coast Bajau it is possible for subjects, obliques and adjuncts to appear pre-verbally. Only non-subject arguments cannot appear in this position. Miller (2007: 193) suggests that there are two positions pre-verbally: [[Topic (linguistics)|topic]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]]. Topic represents presupposed information whilst focus represents new information. In both AV and UV clauses, the preverbal subjects can be either topic or focus. Obliques, on the other hand, are always focus.

Consequently, Miller (2007: 211) analyses the clause structure of West Coast Bajau as follows:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Pragmatic Structure of West Coast Bajau'''
{| class="wikitable"
!FOCUS
!TOPIC
!PRED
|}
The preverbal focus position can be followed by focus particles such as ''no.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Reconstruction==
Proto-Sama-Bajaw is reconstructed in Pallesen (1985). Pallesen (1985) considers the homeland of Proto-Sama-Bajaw to be in the [[Basilan Strait]] area, around 800 AD.

'''Schallanalyse''' (pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈʃal anaˈlyzə|}}), "sound analysis,") was a method of [[poetic]] analysis developed by the renowned [[philologist]] [[Eduard Sievers]], and described in detail in his book ''Ziele und Wege der Schallanalyse'' (1924). Sievers had previously developed a system of [[Sievers' Theory of Anglo-Saxon Meter|"five types"]] to describe the rhythmic patterns found in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Old Saxon language|Old Saxon]] poetry, which had met with widespread acceptance. He then abandoned the five types in favor of his new model. ''Schallanalyse'', however, proved difficult to understand for even the most intelligent people in his field and had very few adherents, usually people who worked with Sievers personally.

A '''sill plate''' or '''sole plate''' in [[construction]] and [[architecture]] is the bottom horizontal member of a [[wall]] or [[building]] to which vertical members are attached. The word plate is typically omitted in America and carpenters speak simply of the "sill". Other names are ground plate, ground sill, groundsel,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Ground sill&lt;/ref&gt; and midnight sill. Sill plates are usually composed of [[lumber]] but can be any material. The timber at the top of a wall is often called a top plate, pole plate, [[wall plate]] or simply "the plate".

==Timber sills==
[[File:Zicht op doorgang van de schuur - Schoonebeek - 20411613 - RCE.jpg|thumb|An unusual barn in [[Schoonebeek]], Netherlands with interrupted sills, the posts land directly on the padstone foundation. Image: Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands]]
[[File:Kravik Mellom, detalj av fundamentet.jpg|thumb|Norwegian style framing, Kravik Mellom, Norway]]
In historic buildings the sills were almost always large, solid timbers framed together at the corners, carry the [[Bent (structural)|bents]], and are set on the stone or brick foundation walls, [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], or piles (wood posts driven or set into the ground). The sill typically carries the wall framing (posts and studs) and floor [[joist]]s.

There are rare examples of historic buildings in the U.S. where the floor joists land on the foundation and a plank sill or timber sill sit on top of the joists.&lt;ref&gt;Sobon, Jack A.. Historic American timber joinery: a graphic guide. Fourth printing. ed. Becket: Timber Framers Guild, 2010. pp 21, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Another rare, historic building technique is for the posts of a timber frame building to land directly on a foundation or [[Post in ground|in the ground]] and the sills fit between the posts and are called ''interrupted sills''.

==Stick framing==
In modern, wood construction, sills usually come in sizes of 2×4, 2×6, 2×8, and 2×10. In [[framing (construction)|stick framing,]] the sill is made of [[Wood preservation|treated lumber]], and is anchored to the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] wall, often with [[Screw|J-bolts]], to keep the building from coming off the foundation during a severe storm or earthquake. Building codes require that the bottom of the sill plate be kept 6 to 8 inches above the finished grade, to hinder termites, and to prevent the sill plate from rotting.

==Automobiles==
In [[automobiles]], the sill plate is located underneath the door and sometimes displays the make or model of the vehicle.

==Naval architecture==
In [[naval architecture]], sill also refers to the lower horizontal plate (frame) height, above which doors and access opening are fixed.

'''Slips''' is a device used to grip and hold the upper part of a [[drill string]] to the [[drill floor]] on an [[Drilling rig|oil rig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alcoinc.ca/products/drilling-service-rig-equipment/floor-equipment/manual-slips.aspx|title=Manual Slips {{!}} Alco Inc.|website=www.alcoinc.ca|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slips are constructed as a collection of metal wedges, hinged together to form a circular shape around the [[drill pipe]]. On the inside surface, the slips normally has replaceable steel teeth that grips the pipe. The outsides of the slips are [[tapered]] and meets a similar taper on the [[drill floor]]. Usually the pipe goes through a [[Rotary table (drilling rig)|Rotary table]] - machinery that makes the pipe rotate.

After the slips is placed around the [[drill pipe]], it is lowered so that the teeth on the inside grip the pipe and the slips are pulled down. The wedges then holds the drill pipe by the [[compressive force]].

After work is completed, the drill string is raised, thereby unlocking the [[gripping action]]. The slips are then lifted away.

'''Sri Lanka Indo-Portuguese''', '''Ceylonese Portuguese Creole''' or '''Sri Lankan Portuguese Creole (SLPC)''' is a language spoken in [[Sri Lanka]]. While the predominant languages of the island are [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the interaction of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and the Sri Lankans led to the evolution of a new language, Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole (SLPC), which flourished as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' on the island for over 350 years (16th to mid-19th centuries). SLPC continues to be spoken by an unknown, extremely small population.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Smith, IR. Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole Phonology. 1978. Dravidian Linguistics Association.&lt;/ref&gt; All speakers of SLPC are members of the [[Burgher people|Burgher]] community: descendents of the Portuguese and Dutch who  founded families in Sri Lanka. [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], [[Eurasia]]ns and [[Burgher people|Burghers]] account for 0.2% of the Sri Lankan population.&lt;ref name=jay1&gt;Jayasuriya, Shihan de Silva The Portuguese Cultural Imprint on Sri Lanka. 1998. Lusotopie 2000. University of London&lt;/ref&gt;  Though only a small group of people actually continue to speak SLPC, Portuguese cultural traditions are still in wide practice by many Sri Lankans who are neither of Portuguese descent nor [[Roman Catholics]]. SLPC is associated with the [[Sri Lanka Kaffir people]], an ethnic minority group. SLPC has been considered the most important creole dialect in [[Asia]] because of its vitality and the influence of its vocabulary on the Sinhalese language.&lt;ref name=jackson&gt;Jackson, KD. Sing without Shame: oral traditions in Indo-Portuguese Creole verse: with transcription and analysis. 1990. John Benjamins Pub Co&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lexical borrowing]] from Portuguese can be observed in many areas of the Sinhalese language. Portuguese influence has been so deeply absorbed into daily Sri Lankan life and behavior that these traditions will likely continue into perpetuity.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

==History==
In 1517, the Portuguese, attracted by the island's spices and strategic position (midway between their holdings on the west coast of India and [[Malacca]]), sent an expedition from [[Goa]] to establish a trading post at [[Colombo]].&lt;ref name=jay1/&gt; They introduced [[Christianity]] to the island, and granted special favors to those who converted. Using the unstable political situation on the island to their advantage, the Portuguese soon gained the position of guardians of the nominal monarch of southern Sri Lanka. In 1557, [[Dharmapala]], who was the king at [[Kotte]], near Colombo, and had [[suzerainty]] over [[Kandy]] and [[Jaffna]] (the other two kingdoms) was baptized Dom João Dharmapala breaking a 1,850-year-old tradition as a Christian king sat on the Sinhalese throne. Several Sri Lankan aristocrats and others followed the King and converted.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; In 1597, Dharmapala, the last king of the Kotte, died childless, and willed his realm to [[Philip II of Spain|Philip I]], king of Portugal. In 1617, with the annexation of Jaffna, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] authority extended over the entire lowland zone.&lt;ref name=jay1/&gt;  Catholicism continued to spread, but the Portuguese did not train an indigenous clergy, so it was simply a microcosm of the church in Portugal.

The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] were in contact with the Kandyan court as early as 1602, but it wasn't until 1632 that the Kandyan monarch, Raja Sinha II, invited Dutch cooperation in expelling the Portuguese from the island. A long period of conflict ensued, including the Dutch takeover of [[Batticaloa]] in 1638, and ending with the fall of [[Mannar, Sri Lanka|Mannar]] and Jaffna in 1658. When Raja Sinha II realized that the Dutch were not about to deliver their new conquests to him, the alliance quickly dissolved into enmity. The [[Dutch East India Company]] was primarily interested in commercial profits and resisted engaging in costly military operations against Kandy. During the Dutch reign, 1761–1766, was the only period of outright war.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; The Dutch also maltreated the Catholics and forced conversions to the [[Calvinist]] faith, the Catholic Church fell to its foundations as Catholic marriages, practice of the faith, and priests were forbidden by the Dutch. Catholics met secretly at each other's homes to practice their faith. At this time, the Catholic Church may have disappeared completely in Sri Lanka had it not been for the work of Goan priests who came to the island to save Catholicism.&lt;ref name=jay1/&gt;

==Origin==
The Portuguese reached India in 1498, before coming to Sri Lanka in 1505. By that time a distinct [[pidgin]] of Portuguese had probably begun to develop, and this was used as the basis for communication with the new territory’s inhabitants. There is very little documented evidence of the linguistic situation at the time, however, it is clear that by the early 17th century a Portuguese-based pidgin was in use in the Portuguese controlled littoral, and was not unknown in the kingdom of Kandy because of its frequent dealings with outsiders. Also, a creole community had been established consisting of two groups or creole speakers: the Topazes (Tupasses, mestiços, etc.), "dark-skinned or half-cast people claiming Portuguese descent, and Christian profession, and Kaffirs (Caffres, etc.), or Bantus".&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

The Topazes were children of local or half-caste mothers and Portuguese or half-caste fathers. They would have been exposed to pidgin/creole Portuguese at home. They identified with Portuguese, a natural occurrence, considering that the Portuguese were at the apex of the social order, though they probably had local family ties as well. The Portuguese brought Bantu slaves (Kaffirs) to Sri Lanka from the eastern [[African Great Lakes]] region. These people would have spoken pidgin Portuguese, and it is likely that many were native creole speakers, but maybe not of the Sri Lanka variety. Because they mainly served as domestic servants, they would have introduced the very young children of Casados (married men who had come with their Portuguese wives as settlers to Sri Lanka) to the pidgin/creole. There may have also been children of chance unions of Portuguese or Topazes with Kaffirs, but it is unclear which group they would have belonged to.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

{{anchor|Ceylon Dutch}}Sri Lanka was a [[Dutch colony]] from 1658 to 1796.  During this time there was Dutch influence on the language, and possibly the development of a '''Portuguese–Dutch Creole'''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  There may still be a few speakers of this in [[Wattala]], a suburb of Colombo.&lt;ref name=arends&gt;Jacques Arends, Pieter Muysken, &amp; Norval Smith, 1994, ''Pidgins and Creoles: An introduction'', p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of [[Dutch Burghers]] spoke Dutch, Portuguese, English, or Portuguese Creole.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Manuel Flores, 2007, ''Re-exploring the Links: History and Constructed Histories Between Portugal and Sri Lanka''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Holm, 1989, ''Pidgins and Creoles'', vol. 2: Reference Survey''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current use ==

Today, the language is spoken by descendants of Topazes and Casados, the [[Portuguese Burghers|Portuguese Burgher]] community, in the Eastern towns of [[Batticaloa]] ([[Koolavaddy]], [[Mamangam, Sri Lanka|Mamangam]], [[Uppodai]], [[Dutch Bar]], [[Akkaraipattu]]) and [[Trincomalee]] ([[Palayuttu]]). However, there are also speakers among the [[Sri Lanka Kaffir people|Kaffir]]s, descendants of Bantu slaves, in the [[North Western Province, Sri Lanka|Northwestern province]], in [[Puttalam]] and in [[Mannar, Sri Lanka|Mannar]]. Additionally, in the village of [[Wahakotte]] near [[Galewala]], in central Sri Lanka, there is a small community of [[Catholicism|Catholic]]s with partial Portuguese ancestry, where the language was spoken until two generations ago.

[[Batticaloa]] is a medium-sized coastal town in the Eastern Province that has always been an isolated outpost, and has been able to retain many ancient habits. This isolation has been a factor in the preservation of SLPC, but very little information exists about the town’s history. Tamil speakers are the overwhelming majority, but there is also a concentrated community of SLPC speaking Burghers. In the early part of the century most Burghers lived close to the center of the town, but more recently, many have moved to outlying areas. All of the Burghers in Batticaloa speak Tamil, many of them better than they do SLPC, and some also speak Sinhala and/or English. The group has no contact with any other creole speakers on the island, and the creole has for a long time been losing ground to Tamil.  Currently, decreasing competence can be observed over successive generations: the younger a Burgher, the less likely they are to know the creole, and if they can speak it, their speech exhibits more Tamil features than that of their parents.  Members of the burgher community are in constant interaction with Tamil speakers as they live, work, play, study, and worship together.  Burgher children learn Tamil at the same time that they learn the creole. It is difficult to determine how many of Batticaloa’s Burghers speak SLPC, but most probably understand it, though in many homes Tamil has become the predominant language.&lt;ref name=jay1/&gt;

The language is facing [[extinct language|extinction]], as it is now only used at home and few are able to speak it well. Throughout Sri Lanka many SLPC speakers have emigrated to other countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United States and Europe. There are still 100 Burgher families in Batticaloa and Trincomalee and 80 Kaffir families in Puttalam that speak the language.  SLPC was very prominent in the past, continuing to be in use despite predictions that it would die out, but current prospects for its survival are equally as bleak as in the past.

An early sample of the language was collected by [[Hugh Nevill]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] civil servant stationed in Sri Lanka in the late 19th century. Among his large collection of oriental manuscripts is the ''[[Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole Manuscript]]'', containing over a thousand verses and a long text in prose.

==Phonology and phonetics==
Precise phonological knowledge of the Sri Lankan Portuguese Creole (SLPC) is limited.  The earliest analysis of the language comes from the 19th and early 20th centuries, but since the research was based purely on written data, it lacks insight on how speech was actually produced.  The only complete study that includes phonological analysis of native speakers seems to be Ian R Smith’s thesis which was published in 1978.  His research surveyed the Creole-speaking people living in the Batticaloa area of Sri Lanka.  It can be assumed, unless otherwise indicated, that the phonological information about SLPC in the section on vowels and consonants is solely from his thesis, due to the lack of similar resources of a precise nature.

'''Vowels'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Standard Portuguese]] (SP) has rich vowel phonology with seven to nine oral vowels (depending on which [[dialect]]), five nasal vowels, ten oral [[diphthongs]] and five nasal diphthongs.  While SLPC has retained the same oral vowels found in Standard Continental Portuguese, it does not make the distinction between nasalized and non-nasalized vowels.  While the vowels are derived from Portuguese, the vowel features appear more similar to Tamil, since in both Tamil and the Creole vowels are distinguished by length. &lt;br /&gt; 
Word internal sequences of two vowels do not occur in SLPC, therefore  the creole does not appear to have diphthongs as there are in SP.  Again, vowel lengthening seems to take place instead of diphthongization.

Chart A  shows a vowel chart for SP, where nasality is distinguished from oral vowels, and a vowel chart for SLPC, where vowel length is a distinctive feature.  Chart (B)  shows both long vowels (such as the word for ‘wax’, {{IPA|[ˈseːɾə]}}, from BrP ‘cerar’) and short vowels (such as in the word for ‘want’, {{IPA|[ˈkeɾə]}}, from BrP ‘querer’).

Besides the distinction between vowel length and vowel nasality, the place of stress on vowels distinguishes SP and SLPC.  Both Batticaloan Tamil and the SLPC  have entirely predictable stress² patterns whereas SP does not.   While stress is predictable, it is not simply a surface phenomenon, so it must be represented lexically. 
&lt;br /&gt;A few rules about stress in SLPC:&lt;br /&gt;
1.	Either short or long vowels can take on stress, but long vowels always carry stress.  &lt;br /&gt;
2.	A word can contain only one phonetically long vowel, but numerous unstressed short vowels. &lt;br /&gt; 
3.	Short vowels can be stressed only when found in initial syllables.&lt;br /&gt;
4.	Stress falls on the last underlying long vowel of a word, or on the first vowel of a word having no long vowel.&lt;br /&gt;
Stress is important as it relates to the phonological changes that occur in the Creole.  For instance, there is [vowel reduction] by way of prominence reduction of unstressed vowels.  This means that relatively long vowels in an unstressed position are replaced by shorter vowels of a similar quality.⁶ :So, as a general rule, low and mid-vowels are contrastive under stress in SLPC, but neutralized and given the features of a mid-vowel when not stressed. Another way to say this is that through a pattern of neutralization, high [sonority] vowels are eliminated in SLPC.  The pattern of vowel reduction is shown in Table (1) below:

::Table 1.  Patterns of vowel reduction in SLPC on low, unstressed vowels.

Other phonological processes vowels of  SLPC demonstrate are [[epenthesis]] and [[elision]].  Neither is a very common phenomena, however, so they will only be dealt with briefly.  The insertion of epenthetic {{IPA|/u/}} occurs to prevent the formation of certain consonant clusters that are atypical.  One example of this is seen when the verb ‘to judge’ or {{IPA|[julˈɡa]}}, is nominalized.  This is done by the suffix {{IPA|/-dor/}}, which requires an epenthetic {{IPA|/u/}} when added to the stem {{IPA|/julɡ-/}}, because the potentially resulting consonant cluster of {{IPA|/lɡd/}} does not regularly occur in the language.  Therefore the combination of the stem, the epenthetic {{IPA|/u/}} and the suffix {{IPA|/-dor/}} yields the form {{IPA|[julɡuˈdor]}}, where the {{IPA|/u/}} is inserted in-between the {{IPA|/lɡ/}} and the {{IPA|/d/}}.
Since word medial sequences of two or more vowels do not occur in Sri Lanka, as mentioned earlier, a process of vowel elision and glide epenthesis can co-occur to prevent vowels from coming together.  Firstly, when there exists a possible combination of two vowels as result of some sort of word construction a glide separates them.  Secondly, as a result of this the first vowel of the two may be reduced or elided.

B)Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole

'''Consonants'''&lt;br /&gt;
SLPC uses several manners of consonant articulation which are not found in SP.  Since this Creole do does express influence from Batticaloa Tamil, English,  and Dutch (particularly via loan words.)  It is difficult to determine where some of these segments have been loaned  from.  For instance, the closed front rounded vowel {{IPA|/y/}} is considered a glide in SLPC and does not behave this way in Tamil or Portuguese.   It seems to have evolved for the high front vowel {{IPA|/i/}}

As mentioned earlier, SLPC seems to have an affinity for gemination of vowels resulting in a distinction between short and long vowels.  As for consonants,  there is also a tendency to  geminate all voiceless consonants after a short stressed vowel.   However, all tense consonants can optionally become geminate.  For instance, in the word  {{IPA|/feːci/}} (lock), the {{IPA|/c/}} can become stressed and geminate, to achieve the pronunciation {{IPA|[ˈfeːttʃi]}}.  Similarly,  word {{IPA|/saːku/}} (bag) can become {{IPA|[saːkku]}}  which can be achieved by the simple rule:
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[+tense] C]--&gt;[+long]&lt;/code&gt;.

Standard Portuguese

==Vocabulary==
Like many [[Creole language|creoles]], SLPC is made up of [[lexical item]]s from an array of different sources. There is, of course, much influence from the [[indigenous languages]] like Tamil and Sinhala. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] had a vast impact on this creole, and there are also traces of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and English. It was also most likely influenced by other creoles and varieties of [[Indo-Portuguese]], as the island was visited frequently by traders from [[Goa]] and other Portuguese settlements like [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]], and [[Diu, India|Diu]]. The similarities with other Indo-Portuguese creoles may also be, however, due to similar circumstances and traits of the languages from which they stem. There is also some [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] influences and loan words.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;

Example of Portuguese origin words (traced back to Latin origin)&lt;ref name=jay2&gt;Jayasuriya, Shihan De Silva. 'On the Indo-Portuguese of Ceylon': a translation of a Hugo Schuchardt Manuscript Portuguese Studies, Annual, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

-'''nariz''' = nose - Portuguese nariz&lt;br /&gt;
-'''besos''' =lips - Portuguese beiços (lips)&lt;br /&gt;
-'''kum''' = with - Portuguese com&lt;br /&gt;
¬-'''hum(a)''' = ‘one,’ ‘a/an’ Portuguese um(a)&lt;br /&gt;
-'''sumana''' = week - Portuguese semana&lt;br /&gt;
-'''mael''' = honey -Portuguese mel

&lt;br /&gt;
Example of Portuguese origin words&lt;br /&gt;
-'''meo''' = middle -Portuguese meio&lt;br /&gt;
-'''cam''' = ground, floor -Portuguese chão&lt;br /&gt;
-'''almuça''' = breakfast -Portuguese almoço (lunch)&lt;br /&gt;
-'''fome''' = hunger -Portuguese fome&lt;br /&gt;
-'''basu''' ¬= low -Portuguese baixo&lt;br /&gt;
 
Example of Dutch origin words&lt;br /&gt;
-'''krel''' = curl -Dutch krul&lt;br /&gt;
-'''rol''' = roll -Dutch rollen&lt;br /&gt;
-'''gorgel''' = throat -Dutch gorgel&lt;br /&gt;
-'''ruvin''' = ruin -Dutch ruïne (ruin) Portuguese ruína (ruin)

Example of Tamil/ Sinhala origin words &lt;ref name=jay1/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;	
-'''pepiya''' = speak -Tamil pepiya&lt;br /&gt; 
-'''podiyas''' = children -Sinhala podi (small)  -Batticaloa Tamil potiyan (small boy) &lt;br /&gt;
-'''nona''' = lady  -Sinhala nona&lt;br /&gt; from Portuguese dona (lady)
-'''sarayatiya''' = walking stick -Sinhala sarayatiya

==Syntax==
The normal sentence structure of standard Portuguese (SP) is subject verb object (SVO). In Sri Lanka Portuguese Creole (SLPC), SVO dominates, but SOV and OSV also occur.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt; The syntax structure is similar to that of Tamil. For example, the verb has been reduced to a single form, and tense-mood-aspect markers (lo, te, ja) indicate the future, present and past tenses; that is, lo leva (SLPC): levarae (SP) 'he will carry'; te folga (SLPC): folgam (SP) 'they rejoice'; ja olha (SLPC): olhei (SP) 'I saw.' &lt;ref name=jay2/&gt; (see ‘phrase samples’ below)&lt;br /&gt;		
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, ‘se’ the conditional marker, comes at the end of the utterance like in:&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
''ja pepiya se''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''nosse jentis dos pesam tinhe se''&lt;br /&gt;
‘if [they] speak.’&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;‘if two of our people are [there].’&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In standard Portuguese, the conditional marker ‘se’ usually comes at the beginning of the utterance:&lt;br /&gt;
''se eu vou contigo, eu vou dirigir.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;se soubesse do bem que me faz!''&lt;br /&gt;
“if I go with you, I will drive.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;“if [he/she] knew the good it does me!”&lt;br /&gt;
Phrase Samples:&lt;ref name=cross&gt;Crosswhite, Katherine. Vowel Reduction in Optimality Theory. 2001. illustrated. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
''Que vosse lo* tem diziado per acha?'' “what will you please to have?”
*note ‘lo’ to indicate future
''Tem aquel verdade?'' “Is it true?”&lt;br /&gt;
''Ala nontem asiilei cousa.'' “There is no such thing.”&lt;br /&gt;
''Eu nihumtempo novo ouvi aquel.'' “I have never heard of it.”&lt;br /&gt;
''Vosse que te* avisa parmi per fai?'' “What do you advise me to do?”
*note ‘te’ to indicate present
''Huma nonpode ouvi otro huma que papia.'' “One cannot hear another speak”&lt;br /&gt;
''Vosse quanto vez ja* caza?'' “How many times have you married?”
*note ‘ja’ to indicate past tense

Swaminatha Desikar's father was a respected [[spiritual leader]]. His father [[Sundaresanar]] Desikar was a philosopher and Sthapathi. The great Tamil poet Velaiyar  is the grand father of Swaminatha Desikar and  Siva Prakasar&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tamilbooksonline.in/searchbooks1.php?code=TA014539&amp;&amp;bookname=SIVAPRAKASAR%20ARULIYA%20SIVA%20JEEVA%20IKKIYAM&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Karunai prakasar]] are sundaresanar's uncles. Gnambikai Ammal wife of Santhalinga Swamigal is Sundaresanar’s aunt.

[[Siva prakasar]] was blessed as ‘Siva anuputhichelvar’ by Sri Sivagnana Balaya swamigal from [[Mailam]] Pommapura Aathenam mutt. He is also acclaimed as ‘Karpanai Kalangiyam’ by  Tamil scholars. He compiled " Neerotta amaha Anthathi " to defeat an arrogant Poet. Those thirty venpa verses will not make both lips touch. And also written '[[Nanneri]],  [[Yesu Matha Niragaranam]] (The Refuting the Religion of Jesus).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/88685765/ME-A-BOAT#fullscreen&lt;/ref&gt;

He attain mukthi motcha at his 32 age in [[Nallathur]] near pondy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13784">In [[computer science]], '''syntactic sugar'''  is [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] within a [[programming language]] that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer.

For example, many programming languages provide special syntax for referencing and updating [[Array data type|array]] elements. Abstractly, an array reference is a procedure of two arguments: an array and a subscript vector, which could be expressed as &lt;code&gt;get_array(Array, vector(i,j))&lt;/code&gt;. Instead, many languages provide syntax like &lt;code&gt;Array[i,j]&lt;/code&gt;. Similarly an array element update is a procedure of three arguments, something like &lt;code&gt;set_array(Array, vector(i,j), value)&lt;/code&gt;, but many languages provide syntax like &lt;code&gt;Array[i,j] = value&lt;/code&gt;.

A construct in a language is called "syntactic sugar" if it can be removed from the language without any effect on what the language can do: [[Function (engineering)|functionality]] and [[expressive power (computer science)|expressive power]] will remain the same.

Language processors, including [[compiler]]s, [[Static program analysis|static analyzers]], and the like, often expand sugared constructs into more fundamental constructs before processing, a process sometimes called "desugaring".

== Origins ==
The term ''syntactic sugar'' was coined by [[Peter J. Landin]] in 1964 to describe the surface syntax of a simple [[ALGOL]]-like programming language which was defined semantically in terms of the applicative expressions of [[lambda calculus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Landin |first=Peter J. |date=1964 |title=The mechanical evaluation of expressions |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Landin64.pdf |journal= The Computer Journal|publisher=[[Computer Journal]] |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=308–320 |doi=10.1093/comjnl/6.4.308 |accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Abelson|Sussman|1996|loc=Chapter 1, [http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_17 footnote 11]}}&lt;!-- reference credits coinage to Landin, hence included --&gt; centered on lexically replacing λ with "where".

Later programming languages, such as [[CLU (programming language)|CLU]], [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], extended the term to refer to syntax within a language which could be defined in terms of a language core of essential constructs; the convenient, higher-level features could be "desugared" and decomposed into that subset.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Liskov, "A History of CLU", MIT Laboratory for Computer Science Technical Report 561 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; This is, in fact, the usual mathematical practice of building up from primitives.

Building on Landin's distinction between essential language constructs and syntactic sugar, in 1991, [[Matthias Felleisen]] proposed a codification of "expressive power" to align with "widely held beliefs" in the literature. He defined "more expressive" to mean that without the language constructs in question, a program would have to be completely reorganized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Felleisen|first=Matthias|date=December 1991|title=On the Expressive Power of Programming Languages|url=http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/Publications/Scheme/scp91-felleisen.ps.gz|journal=Science of Computer Programming|publisher=Springer-Verlag|volume=17|issue=1–3|pages=35–75|doi=10.1016/0167-6423(91)90036-W|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable examples ==
* In [[COBOL]], many of the intermediate keywords are syntactic sugar that may optionally be omitted. For example, the sentence &lt;code&gt;MOVE A B.&lt;/code&gt; and the sentence &lt;code&gt;MOVE A TO B.&lt;/code&gt; perform exactly the same function, but the second makes what action is going to be performed somewhat clearer.
* [[Augmented assignment]] or compound assignment operators: For example, &lt;code&gt;a&amp;nbsp;+=&amp;nbsp;b&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;a = a + b&lt;/code&gt; in C and similar languages, assuming &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has no side effects such as if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is a regular variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e1wf2hxf.aspx |title=C Compound Assignment |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=msdn.microsoft.com |publisher=Microsoft |access-date=20 June 2016 |quote=However, the compound-assignment expression is not equivalent to the expanded version because the compound-assignment expression evaluates expression1 only once, while the expanded version evaluates expression1 twice: in the addition operation and in the assignment operation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/134136 |title=Why are shortcuts like x += y considered good practice? |last1=Garavaglia |first1=Emilio |date=26 July 2015 |website=stackexchange.com |access-date=20 June 2016 |quote=optimization can [be done] if 'finding x' has no side effects}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Perl]], &lt;code&gt;unless (condition) {...} &lt;/code&gt; is syntactic sugar for &lt;code&gt;if (not condition) {...}&lt;/code&gt;. Additionally, any statement can be followed by a condition, so &lt;code&gt;statement if condition&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;if (condition) {statement}&lt;/code&gt;, but the former is more naturally formatted on a single line.

* The C# language allows variables to be declared as &lt;code&gt;var x = expr&lt;/code&gt;, which allows the compiler to deduce the type of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; from the expression &lt;code&gt;expr&lt;/code&gt;, instead of requiring an explicit type declaration.

== Criticism ==
Some programmers feel that these syntax usability features are either unimportant or outright frivolous. Notably, special syntactic forms make a language less uniform and its specification more complex, and may cause problems as programs become large and complex. This view is particularly widespread in the [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] community, as Lisp has very simple and regular syntax, and the surface syntax can easily be modified.{{sfn|Abelson|Sussman|1996|loc=Chapter 1, [http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-10.html#footnote_Temp_17 footnote 11]}}
For example, [[Alan Perlis]] once quipped in "[[Epigrams on Programming]]", in a reference to [[Curly bracket programming language|bracket-delimited languages]], that "Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the [[Semicolon#Programming|semi-colons]]".{{sfn|Perlis|1982|loc=Epigram #3}}

== Derivative terms ==

=== Syntactic salt ===
The metaphor has been extended by coining the term ''syntactic salt'', which indicates a feature designed to make it harder to write bad code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/syntactic-salt.html |title=The Jargon File - syntactic salt |date=2003-06-12 |access-date=2018-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030612232319/http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/syntactic-salt.html |archive-date=2003-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, syntactic salt is a hoop that programmers must jump through just to prove that they know what is going on, rather than to express a program action. For example, in  [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] assigning a [[Floating-point arithmetic|float value]] to a variable declared as an [[Integer|int]] without additional syntax explicitly stating that intention will result in a compile error, while [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] will automatically truncate any floats assigned to an int. However this is not syntax, but semantics.

In [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], when hiding an inherited class member, a compiler warning is issued unless the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword is used to specify that the hiding is intentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/435f1dw2.aspx|title=new Modifier (C# Reference)|publisher=Microsoft|work=microsoft.com|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid potential bugs owing to the similarity of the [[switch statement]] syntax with that of C or C++, C# requires a &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; for each non-empty &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; label of a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; (unless &lt;code&gt;[[goto]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;throw&lt;/code&gt; is used) even though it does not allow implicit ''fall-through''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/06tc147t.aspx |title=switch (C# Reference) |publisher=Microsoft |work=microsoft.com |accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Using &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; and specifying the subsequent label produces a C/C++-like ''fall-through''.)

Syntactic salt may defeat its purpose by making the code unreadable and thus worsen its quality&amp;nbsp;– in extreme cases, the essential part of the code may be shorter than the overhead introduced to satisfy language requirements.

An alternative to syntactic salt is generating compiler warnings when there is high probability that the code is a result of a mistake&amp;nbsp;– a practice common in modern C/C++ compilers.

=== Syntactic saccharin ===
Other extensions are ''syntactic [[saccharin]]'' and ''syntactic [[syrup]]'', meaning gratuitous syntax that does not make programming any easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/syntactic-sugar.html|title=syntactic sugar|work=catb.org|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OfWiZNhyRGgC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=syntactic+saccharin+example&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JG088C25Mw&amp;sig=_DnqFej7t-Wuw20YKYgHXKsD24E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=syntactic%20saccharin%20example&amp;f=false|title=Mathematics of Program Construction|work=google.com|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dean |first=Thomas |date=2004 |title=Talking with Computers: Explorations in the Science and Technology of Computing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp72pk9QW0gC&amp;pg=PA115 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=115 |isbn=9780521542043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f396/bc99c7e444f70db69fb3f42e76e94e9d39a3.pdf |title=Fine control of demand in Haskell |last1=Harrison |first1=William |last2=Sheard |first2=Tim |date=July 8–10, 2002 |publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg |book-title=Mathematics of Program Construction: 6th International Conference, MPC 2002, Dagstuhl Castle, Germany, July 8–10, 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1946">'''Síle Ní Chéileachair''' (1924 – 1985) was an Irish short story writer who wrote in the [[Irish language]]. She was one of the authors of a highly regarded collection published jointly with her brother, [[Donncha Ó Céileachair]].

She was born on 25 July 1924 in [[Cúil Aodha]], an Irish-speaking district in [[County Cork]]. She trained as a teacher at [[Mary Immaculate College]] in [[Limerick]] and subsequently taught at [[Haroldscross]] and at [[Crumlin, Dublin]]. In 1953 she married Dónal Ó Cochláin and they had three sons and three daughters. The household lived in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref name="ainm"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ainm.ie/Bio.aspx?ID=502|title= Ó Céileachair, Donncha (1918 – 1960)|website=An Bunachar Náisiúnta Beathaisnéisní Gaeilge|accessdate=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She and her brother were involved with Cumann na Scríbhneoirí (The Irish-language Writers’ Association) in Dublin in the nineteen fifties. She won a prize for a short story at the 1950 [[Oireachtas]], and in 1955 she and Donncha published ''Bullaí Mhártain'', an acclaimed collection of 14 stories dealing with urban and rural themes.&lt;ref name="ainm"/&gt; This collection has been praised for its concise style and broad range of subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irishstudysite.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Stair-litr%25C3%25ADocht-na-Gaeilge-san-Fhichi%25C3%25BA-hAois.doc&amp;prev=search Bannister, Garry, ‘Gnéithe den Litríocht san Fhichiú hAois’]&lt;/ref&gt;

She died on 26 August 1985 and was buried at [[Bohernabreena]] in Dublin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1630">'''Tadhg Olltach Ó an Cháinte''', Irish poet, fl. c. 1601.

A member of the [[Ó an Cháintighe]] bardic family, and a relative of [[Fear Feasa Ó'n Cháinte]], Tadhg Olltach is probably to be identified with 'Teige on Canty, of Clansheane', mentioned in a fiant of [[Elizabeth I]] dated 14 May 1601, along with his wife, 'Margaret ny Fynan'. Slanshane appears as part of the [[Barony of Carbery|Carbery]] lands of [[MacCarthy Reagh|Mac Carrthaigh Riabhach]] in an [[inquisition]] of 1636, showing that it compromised the northern part of the parish of [[Desertserges]], [[County Cork]].

Tadgh is almost solely known by the poem ''Torchoir ceól Cloinne Cathoil'', a lament for [[Conchubhar Mac Conghalaigh]], harper to [[Donnell II O'Donovan|Domhnall Ó Donnabháin]], lord of Clann Chathail from 1584 until his death in 1639.

==Trivia==

Ó an Cháinte's first name, Tadhg means 'poet' or 'philosopher'.  Olltach is a cognomen.

{{Chinese tones}}
'''Tone''' is the use of [[pitch (music)|pitch]] in [[language]] to distinguish lexical or grammatical meaning – that is, to distinguish or to [[inflection|inflect]] words.{{sfnp|Yip|2002|pp=1–3, 17-18}}  All verbal languages use pitch to express emotional and other paralinguistic information and to convey emphasis, contrast, and other such features in what is called [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], but not all languages use tones to distinguish words or their inflections, analogously to consonants and vowels. Languages that do have this feature are called '''tonal languages'''; the distinctive tone patterns of such a language are sometimes called '''tonemes''',&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Trask, ''A Dictionary of Phonetics and Phonology'', Routledge 2004. Entry for "toneme".&lt;/ref&gt; by analogy with ''[[phoneme]]''. Tonal languages are common in East and Southeast Asia, the Pacific, Africa, and the Americas; as many as seventy percent{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} of world languages may be tonal.{{sfnp|Yip|2002|pp=1–3, 17-18}}

In many tonal African languages, such as most [[Bantu languages]], tones are distinguished by their pitch level relative to each other, known as a '''register''' tone system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Odden|first=David|chapter=Tone: African languages|title=Handbook of Phonological Theory|year=1995|location=Oxford|publisher=Basil Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In multisyllable words, a single tone may be carried by the entire word rather than a different tone on each syllable. Often, grammatical information, such as past versus present, "I" versus "you", or positive versus negative, is conveyed solely by tone.

In the most widely spoken tonal language, [[Mandarin Chinese]], tones are distinguished by their distinctive shape, known as '''contour''', with each tone having a different internal pattern of rising and falling pitch.{{sfnp|Yip|2002|pp=178–184}} Many words, especially monosyllabic ones, are differentiated solely by tone. In a multisyllabic word, each syllable often carries its own tone. Unlike in Bantu systems, tone plays little role in the grammar of modern standard Chinese, though the tones descend from features in [[Old Chinese]] that had [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] significance (such as changing a verb to a noun or vice versa).

Contour systems are typical of languages of the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]], including [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]], [[Vietic languages|Vietic]] and [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] languages. The [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]], [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]], [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] and [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] languages spoken in Africa are dominated by register systems.&lt;ref name="Maddieson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maddieson|first=Ian|chapter=Tone|editor1-last=Dryer|editor1-first=Matthew S.|editor2-last=Haspelmath|editor2-first=Martin|title=The World Atlas of Language Structures Online|chapter-url=http://wals.info/chapter/13|location=Leipzig|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology|year=2013|url=http://wals.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages combine both systems, such as Cantonese, which produces three varieties of contour tone at three different pitch levels,{{sfnp|Yip|2002|pp=174–178}} and the Omotic (Afroasiatic) language [[Bench language|Bench]], which employs five level tones and one or two rising tones across levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wedeking|first=Karl|chapter=Why Bench' (Ethiopia) has five level tones today|title=Studia Linguistica Diachronica et Sinchronica|year=1985|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|pages=881–902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many languages use tone in a more limited way. In [[Japanese pitch accent|Japanese]], fewer than half of the words have a [[downstep|drop in pitch]]; words contrast according to which syllable this drop follows. Such minimal systems are sometimes called [[pitch accent]] since they are reminiscent of [[stress accent]] languages, which typically allow one principal stressed syllable per word. However, there is debate over the definition of pitch accent and whether a coherent definition is even possible.{{sfnp|Hyman|2009}}

==List of tonal languages==

===Africa===
Most languages of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] are members of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo family]], which is predominantly tonal; notably excepting [[Swahili language|Swahili]] (in the Southeast), most languages spoken in the [[Senegambia]] (among them [[Wolof language|Wolof]], [[Serer language|Serer]] and [[Cangin languages]]), [[Koyra Chiini language|Koyra Chiini]] and [[Fula language|Fulani]]. The Afroasiatic languages include both tonal ([[Chadic languages|Chadic]], [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]) and nontonal ([[Semitic languages|Semitic]], [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], and most [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]]) branches.{{sfnp|Yip|2002|p=131}} All three [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan]] language families: [[Khoe languages|Khoe]], [[Kx'a languages|Kx'a]] and [[Tuu languages|Tuu]], are tonal.

===Asia===
Numerous tonal languages are widely spoken in [[China]] and [[Mainland Southeast Asia]]. [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Tai-Kadai]] languages are mostly tonal, including [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Lao language|Lao]], all the [[varieties of Chinese]] (though some, such as [[Shanghainese]], are only marginally tonal{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}) and [[Burmese language|Burmese]] with few exceptions such as [[Amdo Tibetan]]. The [[Hmong–Mien languages]] are some of the most tonal languages in the world, with as many as twelve phonemically distinct tones. [[Austroasiatic]] (such as [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Mon language|Mon]]) and [[Austronesian]] (such as [[Malay language|Malay]]) languages are mostly non tonal with the rare exception of Austroasiatic languages like [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and Austronesian languages like [[Cèmuhî language|Cèmuhî]] and [[Utsul]].{{sfnp|Yip|2002|pp=172–173}} Tones in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alves|first1=Mark|title=Tonal Features and the Development of Vietnamese Tones|journal=Working Papers in Linguistics: Department of University of Hawaii at Manoa|date=1995|volume=27|pages=1–13|url=https://www.academia.edu/download/30495045/Alves_Vietnamese_Tones_Features.pdf|quote=Clearly, language contact with Chinese had something to do with the development of Vietnamese tones, as the tonal system of Vietnamese corresponds quite directly to the eight-way system of Middle Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Utsul]] may result from heavy [[Chinese language|Chinese]] influence on both languages.

There does seem to have been some speculation among scholars about the possible origin of Punjabi's tone-language character but without any final and convincing answer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;and many [[Bengali-Assamese languages]] such as [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]], [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]], [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]] and [[Chakma language|Chakma]].

===Europe===
In Europe, [[Indo-European languages]] such as [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] ([[Germanic languages]]), [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]] ([[Slavic languages]]), [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] ([[Baltic languages]]), have tonal characteristics.

===Australasia===
Although the Austronesian language family has some tonal members such as [[New Caledonia]]'s [[Cèmuhî language]], no tonal languages have been discovered in Australia. Tone is also present in many [[Papuan languages]].

===America===
A large number of North, South and Central American languages are tonal, including many of the [[Athabaskan languages]] of [[Alaska]] and the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] (including [[Navajo language|Navajo]]),{{sfnp|Kingston|2005}} and the [[Oto-Manguean languages]] of Mexico. Among the [[Mayan languages]], which are mostly non-tonal, [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec]] (with the largest number of speakers), [[Uspantek language|Uspantek]], and one dialect of [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]] have developed tone systems.  However, although tone systems have been recorded for many American languages, little theoretical work has been completed for the characterization of their tone systems.  In different cases, Oto-Manguean tone languages in Mexico have been found to possess tone systems similar to both Asian and African tone languages.{{sfnp|Yip|2002|pp=212–214}}

===Summary===
Languages that are tonal include:
* Over 50% of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]].  All [[Sinitic languages]] (most prominently, the [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese languages]]), some [[Tibetic languages]], including the standard languages of [[Lhasa]] and [[Bhutan]], and [[Burmese language|Burmese]].
* In the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] family, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and other members of the [[Vietic languages]] family are strongly tonal. Other branches of this family, such as [[Mon language|Mon]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]], and the [[Munda languages]], are entirely non-tonal.
* Some of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of [[Austronesian languages]] in [[New Caledonia]] (such as [[Paicî language|Paicî]] and [[Cèmuhî language|Cèmuhî]]) and [[New Guinea]] (such as [[Mor language (Austronesian)|Mor]], [[Ma'ya language|Ma'ya]] and [[Matbat language|Matbat]]) plus some of the [[Chamic languages]] such as [[Tsat language|Tsat]] in [[Hainan]] are tonal. 
* The entire [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]] family, spoken mainly in China, Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos, and including [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]] is tonal.
* The entire [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien]] family is highly tonal.
* Many [[Afroasiatic languages]] in the Chadic and Omotic branches have register tone systems, including [[Hausa language|Hausa]]. Omotic languages are an exception in having both contour and register tones. Some Cushitic languages also have tone systems.
* The vast majority of [[Niger–Congo languages]], such as [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Lingala language|Lingala]], [[Maninka language|Maninka]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], and the [[Zulu language|Zulu]], have register tone systems. The [[Kru languages]] have contour tones. Notable non-tonal Niger–Congo languages are [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Fula language|Fula]], and [[Wolof language|Wolof]].
* Most [[Nilo-Saharan languages]] including [[Dinka]] and [[Luo dialect|Luo]] have register tone systems.
* All [[Khoisan languages]] in southern Africa have contour tone systems; some languages like [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] have mixed tone systems like that of Cantonese.
* Slightly more than half of the [[Athabaskan languages]], such as [[Navajo language|Navajo]], have register tone systems (languages in California, Oregon and a few in Alaska excluded). The Athabaskan tone languages fall into two "mirror image" groups. That is, a word which has a high tone in one language will have a cognate with a low tone in another, and ''vice versa.''
* [[Iroquoian languages]] like [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]] commonly have register tone; [[Cherokee language#Tone|Oklahoma Cherokee]] has the most extensive tonal inventory, with six tones, of which four are contours.&lt;ref name="Cherokee"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Montgomery-Anderson |first=Brad |date=May 30, 2008 |title=A Reference Grammar of Oklahoma Cherokee |type=Ph.D. |publisher=University of Kansas |page=49 |url=http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/4212/umi-ku-2613_1.pdf;jsessionid=37CBA1DB07BC9860F19A7737A89B3F70?sequence=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the correlation between contour tone and simple syllable structures is clearly shown; whereas Mohawk, with three register tones in stressed syllables only, [[Mohawk language#Consonants|permits a large number of consonant clusters]], Cherokee phonotactics permit only syllables of the structure (s)(C)V.
* All [[Oto-Manguean languages]] are tonal. Most have register tone, though some have contour tones as well.  In some cases, as with [[Mixtec]], tone system variations between dialects are sufficiently great to cause mutual unintelligibility.
* Many languages of [[New Guinea]] like [[Siane language|Siane]] possess register tone systems.
* Some Indo-European languages as well as others possess what is termed [[pitch accent]], where only the stressed syllable of a word can have different contour tones; these are not always considered to be cases of tone language.
* Some European-based [[creole language]]s, such as [[Saramaccan language|Saramaccan]] and [[Papiamento]], have tone from their African [[Stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]] languages.

In some cases it is difficult to determine whether a language is tonal. For example, the [[Ket language]] has been described as having up to eight tones by some investigators, as having four tones by others, but by some as having no tone at all. In cases such as these, the classification of a language as tonal may depend on the researcher's interpretation of what tone is. For instance, the Burmese language has phonetic tone, but each of its three tones is accompanied by a distinctive [[phonation]] (creaky, murmured or plain vowels). It could be argued either that the tone is incidental to the phonation, in which case Burmese would not be [[phoneme|phonemically]] tonal, or that the phonation is incidental to the tone, in which case it would be considered tonal. Something similar appears to be the case with Ket.

The 19th-century [[constructed language]] [[Solresol]] can consist of only tone, although, unlike all natural tonal languages, Solresol's tone is absolute rather than relative and no tone sandhi occurs.

==Mechanics==
Most languages use pitch as [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] to convey [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and [[pragmatics]], but this does not make them tonal languages. In tonal languages, each syllable has an inherent pitch contour, and thus [[minimal pair]]s (or larger minimal sets) exist between syllables with the same segmental features (consonants and vowels) but different tones.

Here is a minimal tone set from [[Mandarin Chinese]], which has [[Standard Chinese phonology#Tones|five tones]], here transcribed by diacritics over the vowels:
[[File:Pinyin Tone Chart.svg|right|thumb|150px|The tone contours of Standard Chinese. In the convention for Chinese, 1 is low and 5 is high. The corresponding [[tone letter]]s are {{IPA|˥ ˧˥ ˨˩˦ ˥˩}}.]]
# A high level tone: /á/ ([[pinyin]] {{angle bracket|ā}})
# A tone starting with mid pitch and rising to a high pitch: /ǎ/ (pinyin {{angle bracket|á}})
# A low tone with a slight fall (if there is no following syllable, it may start with a dip then rise to a high pitch): /à/ (pinyin {{angle bracket|ǎ}})
# A short, sharply falling tone, starting high and falling to the bottom of the speaker's vocal range: /â/ (pinyin {{angle bracket|à}})
# A [[Standard Chinese phonology#Neutral tone|neutral tone]], with no specific contour, used on weak syllables; its pitch depends chiefly on the tone of the preceding syllable.

These tones combine with a syllable such as ''ma'' to produce different words. A minimal set based on ''ma'' are, in pinyin transcription,
# ''mā'' (媽/妈) 'mother'
# ''má'' (麻/麻) 'hemp'
# ''mǎ'' (馬/马) 'horse'
# ''mà'' (罵/骂) 'scold'
# ''ma'' (嗎/吗) (an interrogative particle)

These may be combined into the rather contrived sentence,

:{{lang|zh-Hans|妈妈骂马的麻吗?}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|媽媽罵馬的麻嗎?}}
:Pinyin: ''māma mà mǎde má ma?''
:IPA {{IPA|/máma mâ màtə mǎ ma/}}
:Translation: 'Is mom scolding the horse's hemp?'

A well-known [[tongue-twister]] in Standard Thai is:

:{{lang|th|ไหมใหม่ไหม้มั้ย.}}
:IPA: {{IPA|/mǎi mài mâi mái/}}
:Translation: 'Does new silk burn?'&lt;ref&gt;Tones change over time, but may retain their original spelling. The Thai spelling of the final word in the tongue-twister, {{angle bracket|{{lang|th|ไหม}}}}, indicates a rising tone, but the word is now commonly pronounced with a high tone. Therefore a new spelling, {{lang|th|มั้ย}}, is occasionally seen in informal writing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnamese has its version:
{{lang|vi|Bấy nay bây bày bảy bẫy bậy.}}
:{{Lang|vi|Chữ Nôm}}: {{Vi-nom|卑𠉞𣊾排𦉱擺敗}}
:IPA: {{IPA|[ɓʌ̌i̯ nai̯ ɓʌi̯ ɓʌ̂i̯ ɓa᷉i̯ ɓʌ̌ˀi̯ ɓʌ̂ˀi̯]}}
:Translation: 'All along you've set up the seven traps incorrectly!'

Cantonese has its version:
{{lang|yue|一人因一日引一刃一印而忍}}
:Jyutping: ''jat&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; jan&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; jan&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; jat&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; jat&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; jan&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; jat&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; jan&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; jat&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; jan&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ji&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; jan&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''
:IPA: {{IPA|}}
:Translation: ''A person why stay endured due to a day have introduced a knife and a print.''

Tone is most frequently manifested on vowels, but in most tonal languages where [[voiced]] [[syllabic consonant]]s occur they will bear tone as well. This is especially common with syllabic nasals, for example in many [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] and [[Kru languages]], but also occurs in [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. It is also possible for lexically contrastive pitch (or tone) to span entire words or morphemes instead of manifesting on the syllable nucleus (vowels), which is the case in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Chander Shekhar|title=Punjabi Prosody: The Old Tradition and The New Paradigm|date=2004|publisher=Polgasowita: Sikuru Prakasakayo|location=Sri Lanka|pages=70–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tones can interact in complex ways through a process known as [[tone sandhi]].

==Tone and intonation==
Both lexical or grammatical tone and prosodic [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] are cued by changes in pitch, as well sometimes by changes in phonation. Lexical tone coexists with intonation, with the lexical changes of pitch like waves superimposed on larger swells. For example, Luksaneeyanawin (1993) describes three intonational patterns in Thai: falling (with semantics of "finality, closedness and definiteness"), rising ("non-finality, openness and non-definiteness") and "convoluted" (contrariness, conflict and emphasis). The phonetic realization of these intonational patterns superimposed on the five lexical tones of Thai (in citation form) are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Laver (1994). ''Principles of Phonetics'', pp. 477–478&lt;/ref&gt;

With convoluted intonation, it appears that high and falling tone conflate, while the low tone with convoluted intonation has the same contour as rising tone with falling intonation.

=={{vanchor|Register tones and contour tones}}{{anchor|register}}{{anchor|contour}}==
{{redirect|High tone||High tone (telephony)}}
{{main|Contour tone}}

Tone systems fall into two broad patterns, according to whether contour tones exist.

Most [[varieties of Chinese]] use contour tone systems, where the distinguishing feature of the tones are their shifts in pitch (that is, the pitch is a [[contour (linguistics)|contour]]), such as rising, falling, dipping, or level. Most Bantu languages, on the other hand, have non-contour tone (or ''register tone'') systems where the distinguishing feature is the relative difference between the pitches, such as high, mid, or low, rather than their shapes. In such systems there is a default tone, usually low in a two-tone system or mid in a three-tone system, that is more common and less salient than other tones. There are also languages that combine relative-pitch and contour tones, such as many [[Kru languages]], where nouns are distinguished by contour tones and verbs by pitch. Others, such as [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], have phonetic contours, but these can easily be analysed as sequences of single-pitch tones, with for example sequences of high–low {{IPA|/áà/}} becoming falling {{IPA|[âː]}}, and sequences of low–high {{IPA|/àá/}} becoming rising {{IPA|[ǎː]}}.

Falling tones tend to fall further than rising tones rise; high–low tones are common, whereas low–high tones are quite rare. A language with contour tones will also generally have as many or more falling tones than rising tones. However, exceptions are not unheard of; [[Mpi language|Mpi]], for example, has three level and three rising tones, but no falling tones.

===Register phonation===
In a number of East Asian languages, tonal differences are closely intertwined with [[phonation]] differences. In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], for example, the ''ngã'' and ''sắc'' tones are both high-rising but the former is distinguished by having [[glottalization]] in the middle. Similarly, the ''nặng'' and ''huyền'' tones are both low-falling, but the ''nặng'' tone is shorter and pronounced with [[creaky voice]] at the end, while the ''huyền'' tone is longer and often has [[breathy voice]]. In some languages, such as [[Burmese language|Burmese]], pitch and phonation are so closely intertwined that the two are combined in a single phonological system, where neither can be considered without the other. The distinctions of such systems are termed ''[[register (phonology)|registers]]'', not to be confused with "register tones" described above.

==Tone terracing and tone sandhi==

===Tone terracing===
{{main|Tone terracing}}
Tones are realized as pitch only in a relative sense. "High tone" and "low tone" are only meaningful relative to the speaker's vocal range and in comparing one syllable to the next, rather than as a contrast of absolute pitch such as one finds in music. As a result, when one combines tone with sentence [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], the absolute pitch of a high tone at the end of a [[prosodic unit]] may be lower than that of a low tone at the beginning of the unit, because of the universal tendency (in both tonal and non-tonal languages) for pitch to decrease with time in a process called [[downdrift]].

Tones may affect each other just as consonants and vowels do. In many register-tone languages, low tones may cause a [[downstep]] in following high or mid tones; the effect is such that even while the low tones remain at the lower end of the speaker's vocal range (which is itself descending due to downdrift), the high tones drop incrementally like steps in a stairway or [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraced]] rice fields, until finally the tones merge and the system has to be reset. This effect is called [[tone terracing]].

Sometimes a tone may remain as the sole realization of a grammatical particle after the original consonant and vowel disappear, so it can only be heard by its effect on other tones. It may cause downstep, or it may combine with other tones to form contours. These are called [[floating tone]]s.

===Tone sandhi===
{{Main|Tone sandhi}}
In many contour-tone languages, one tone may affect the shape of an adjacent tone. The affected tone may become something new, a tone that only occurs in such situations, or it may be changed into a different existing tone. This is called tone sandhi. In Mandarin Chinese, for example, a dipping tone between two other tones is reduced to a simple low tone, which otherwise does not occur in Mandarin Chinese, whereas if two dipping tones occur in a row, the first becomes a rising tone, indistinguishable from other rising tones in the language. For example, the words 很 {{IPA|[xɤn˨˩˦]}} ('very') and 好 {{IPA|[xaʊ˨˩˦]}} ('good') produce the phrase 很好 {{IPA|[xɤn˧˥ xaʊ˨˩˦]}} ('very good').

==Word tones and syllable tones==
Another difference between tonal languages is whether the tones apply independently to each syllable or to the word as a whole. In [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], and to some extent the [[Kru languages]], each syllable may have a tone, whereas in [[Shanghainese]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} the [[Scandinavian languages]], and many [[Bantu languages]], the contour of each tone operates at the word level. That is, a trisyllabic word in a three-tone syllable-tone language has many more tonal possibilities (3 × 3 × 3 = 27) than a monosyllabic word (3), but there is no such difference in a word-tone language. For example, Shanghainese has two contrastive (phonemic) tones no matter how many syllables are in a word.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Many languages described as having [[pitch accent]] are word-tone languages.

Tone sandhi is an intermediate situation, as tones are carried by individual syllables, but affect each other so that they are not independent of each other. For example, a number of Mandarin Chinese suffixes and grammatical particles have what is called (when describing Mandarin Chinese) a "neutral" tone, which has no independent existence. If a syllable with a neutral tone is added to a syllable with a full tone, the pitch contour of the resulting word is entirely determined by that other syllable:

After high level and high rising tones, the neutral syllable has an independent pitch that looks like a mid-register tone{{spaced ndash}}the default tone in most register-tone languages. However, after a falling tone it takes on a low pitch; the contour tone remains on the first syllable, but the pitch of the second syllable matches where the contour leaves off. And after a low-dipping tone, the contour spreads to the second syllable: the contour remains the same ({{IPA|˨˩˦}}) whether the word has one syllable or two. In other words, the tone is now the property of the word, not the syllable. Shanghainese has taken this pattern to its extreme, as the pitches of all syllables are determined by the tone before them, so that only the tone of the initial syllable of a word is distinctive.

==Tonal polarity==
Languages with simple tone systems or [[pitch accent]] may have one or two syllables specified for tone, with the rest of the word taking a default tone. Such languages differ in which tone is marked and which is the default. In [[Navajo language|Navajo]], for example, syllables have a low tone by default, whereas marked syllables have high tone. In the related language [[Sekani language|Sekani]], however, the default is high tone, and marked syllables have low tone.{{sfnp|Kingston|2005}} There are parallels with stress: English stressed syllables have a higher pitch than unstressed syllables, whereas in [[Russian language|Russian]], stressed syllables have a lower pitch.

==Uses of tone==
In East Asia, tone is typically lexical. This is characteristic of heavily tonal languages such as Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, and [[Hmong language|Hmong]]. That is, tone is used to distinguish words which would otherwise be homonyms, rather than in the grammar, but some [[Yue Chinese]] dialects have minimal grammatical use of tone.

However, in many African languages, especially in the [[Niger–Congo]] family, tone is crucial to the grammar, with relatively little lexical use. In the [[Kru languages]], a combination of these patterns is found: nouns tend to have complex tone systems reminiscent of East Asia but are not much affected by grammatical inflections whereas verbs tend to have simple tone systems of the type more typical of Africa, which are inflected to indicate [[grammatical tense|tense and mood]], [[grammatical person|person]], and [[Grammatical polarity|polarity]], so that tone may be the only distinguishing feature between "you went" and "I won't go".

In colloquial [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], especially when spoken quickly, vowels may [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilate]] to each other, and consonants [[Elision|elide]] so much of the lexical and grammatical information is carried by tone. In languages of West Africa such as Yoruba, people may even communicate with so-called "[[talking drum]]s", which are modulated to imitate the tones of the language, or by [[Whistled language|whistling]] the tones of speech.

Note that tonal languages are not distributed evenly across the same range as non-tonal languages.&lt;ref name="Maddieson" /&gt;  Instead, the majority of tone languages belong to the Niger-Congo, Sino-Tibetan and Vietic groups, which are then composed by a large majority of tone languages and dominate a single region. Only in limited locations (South Africa, New Guinea, Mexico, Brazil and a few others) are tone languages occurring as individual members or small clusters within a non-tone dominated area. In some locations, like Central America, it may represent no more than an incidental effect of which languages were included when one examines the distribution; for groups like Khoi-San in Southern Africa and Papuan languages, whole families of languages possess tonality but simply have relatively few members, and for some North American tone languages, multiple independent origins are suspected.

If generally considering only complex-tone vs. no-tone, it might be concluded that tone is almost always an ancient feature within a language family that is highly conserved among members. However, when considered in addition to "simple" tone systems that include only two tones, tone, as a whole, appears to be more labile, appearing several times within Indo-European languages, several times in American languages, and several times in Papuan families.&lt;ref name="Maddieson" /&gt; That may indicate that rather than a trait unique to some language families, tone is a latent feature of most language families that may more easily arise and disappear as languages change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hombert|first1=Jean-Marie|last2=Ohala|first2=John J.|last3=Ewan|first3=William G.|title=Phonetic Explanations for the Development of Tones|journal=Language|year=1979|volume=55|number=1|pages=37–58|doi=10.2307/412518|jstor=412518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study by [[Caleb Everett]] argued that tonal languages are more common in hot and humid climates, which make them easier to pronounce, even when considering familial relationships. This is perhaps the first known case of influence of the environment on the structure of the languages spoken in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=4321236|year=2015|author1=Everett|first1=C.|title=Climate, vocal folds, and tonal languages: Connecting the physiological and geographic dots|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=112|issue=5|pages=1322–1327|last2=Blasi|first2=D.

==Phonetic notation==
{{see also|Phonetic transcription}}
There are three main approaches to notating tones in phonetic descriptions of a language.
* The easiest from a typological perspective is a numbering system, with the pitch levels assigned numerals and each tone transcribed as a numeral or sequence of numerals. Such systems tend to be idiosyncratic (high tone may be assigned the numeral 1, 3, or 5, for example) and have not been adopted for the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].
* Also simple for simple tone systems is a series of diacritics such as {{angle bracket|ó}} for high tone and {{angle bracket|ò}} for low tone. This has been adopted by the IPA, but is not easy to adapt to complex contour tone systems (see under Chinese below for one workaround). The five IPA diacritics for level tones are {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ő ó ō ò ȍ}}}}, with doubled high and low diacritics for ''extra high'' and ''extra low''. The diacritics combined to form contour tones, of which {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ô ǒ o᷄ o᷅ o᷆ o᷇ o᷈ o᷉}}}} have Unicode font support (support for additional combinations is sparse). Sometimes, a non-IPA vertical diacritic is seen for a second higher mid tone, {{angle bracket|{{IPA|o̍}}}} so in a language with four or six level tones, they may be transcribed {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ó o̍ ō ò}}}} or  {{angle bracket|{{IPA|ő ó o̍ ō ò ȍ}}}}.
* A retired IPA system, sometimes still encountered,&lt;ref&gt;Barry Heselwood (2013) ''Phonetic Transcription in Theory and Practice'', Edinburgh University Press, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; traces the ''shape'' of the tone (the [[pitch trace]]) before the syllable, where a stress mark would go (e.g., {{angbr|{{IPA|ˆo ˇo ˉo ˊo ˋo ˗o ˴o ˍo ˎo ˏo ˬo}}}}). For a more concrete example, take the [[Hanyu Pinyin]] syllable [sa] used in [[Standard Chinese]], after applying the diacritics it becomes easier to identify more specific rising and falling tones: {{IPA|[ˆsa]}} (high peaking tone), {{IPA|[ˍsa]}} (low level tone), etc. It was used in combination with stress marks to indicate intonation as well, as in English {{IPA|[ˈgʊd ˌɑːftə`nuːn]}}.
* The most flexible system, based on the previous spacing diacritics, is that of [[tone letter]]s, which are iconic schematics of the pitch trace of the tone in question. They are most commonly used for complex contour systems, as in the languages of Liberia and southern China.

Very rarely, a tone letter consists of more than three elements (peaking or dipping tones), but occasionally, double-peaking or double-dipping tones are encountered. Reversed tone letters may be used for [[tone sandhi]], and dot-plus-bar tone letters for [[neutral tone]]s.

===Africa===
In African linguistics (as well as in many African orthographies), a set of diacritics is usual to mark tone. The most common are a subset of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|High tone
|acute
|á
|-
|Mid tone
|macron
|ā
|-
|Low tone
|grave
|à
|}

Several variations are found. In many three-tone languages, it is common to mark high and Low tone as indicated above but to omit marking of the mid tone: ''má'' (high), ''ma'' (mid), ''mà'' (low). Similarly, in some two-tone languages, only one tone is marked explicitly, usually the less common one.

With more complex tonal systems, such as in the [[Kru languages|Kru]] and [[Omotic languages]], it is usual to indicate tone with numbers, with 1 for high and 4 or 5 for low in Kru, but 1 for low and 5 for high in Omotic. Contour tones are then indicated 14, 21, etc.

===Asia===
In the Chinese tradition, numerals are assigned to various tones (see [[tone number]]). For instance, [[Standard Mandarin Chinese]], the official language of China, has four lexically contrastive tones, and the numerals 1, 2, 3, and 4 are assigned to four tones. Syllables can sometimes be toneless and are described as having a neutral tone, typically indicated by omitting tone markings. Chinese varieties are traditionally described in terms of four tonal categories ''ping'' ('level'), ''shang'' ('rising'), ''qu'' ('exiting'), ''ru'' ('entering'), based on the traditional analysis of [[Middle Chinese]] (see [[Four tones]]); note that these are not at all the same as the four tones of modern standard Mandarin Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Specifically, words that had the Middle Chinese ''ping'' (level) tone are now distributed over tones 1 and 2 in Mandarin Chinese, while the Middle Chinese ''shang'' (rising) and ''qu'' (exiting) tones have become Mandarin Chinese tones 3 and 4, respectively. Words with the former ''ru'' (entering) tone, meanwhile, have been distributed over all four tones.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the dialect, each of these categories may then be divided into two tones, typically called ''yin'' and ''yang.'' Typically, syllables carrying the ''ru'' tones are closed by voiceless stops in Chinese varieties that have such coda(s) so in such dialects, ''ru'' is not a tonal category in the sense used by Western linguistics but rather a category of syllable structures. Chinese phonologists perceived these [[checked syllable]]s as having concomitant short tones, justifying them as a tonal category. In [[Middle Chinese]], when the tonal categories were established, the ''shang'' and ''qu'' tones also had characteristic final obstruents with concomitant tonic differences whereas syllables bearing the ''ping'' tone ended in a simple sonorant. An alternative to using the Chinese category names is assigning to each category a numeral ranging from 1 to 8, sometimes higher for some Southern Chinese dialects with additional tone splits. Syllables belonging to the same tone category differ drastically in actual phonetic tone across the [[varieties of Chinese]] even among dialects of the same group. For example, the ''yin ping'' tone is a high level tone in Beijing Mandarin Chinese but a low level tone in Tianjin Mandarin Chinese.

More iconic systems use tone numbers or an equivalent set of graphic pictograms known as "[[Y. R. Chao|Chao]] [[tone letter]]s." These divide the pitch into five levels, with the lowest being assigned the value 1 and the highest the value 5. (This is the opposite of equivalent systems in Africa and the Americas.) The variation in pitch of a [[tone contour]] is notated as a string of two or three numbers. For instance, the four Mandarin Chinese tones are transcribed as follows (note that the tone letters will not display properly without a [[International Phonetic Alphabet#Typefaces|compatible font]] installed):

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto"
|+Tones of Standard Chinese
|High tone
|55
| {{IPA|˥}}
|(Tone 1)
|-
|Mid rising tone
|35
| {{IPA|˧˥}}
|(Tone 2)
|-
|Low dipping tone
|214
| {{IPA|˨˩˦}}
|(Tone 3)
|-
|High falling tone
|51
| {{IPA|˥˩}}
|(Tone 4)
|}
A mid-level tone would be indicated by /33/, a low level tone /11/, etc. The doubling of the number is commonly used with level tones to distinguish them from tone numbers; tone 3 in Mandarin Chinese, for example, is not mid /3/. However, it is not necessary with tone letters, so /33/ = simple {{IPA|/˧/}}.

IPA diacritic notation is also sometimes seen for Chinese. One reason it is not more widespread is that only two contour tones, rising {{IPA|/ɔ̌/}} and falling {{IPA|/ɔ̂/}}, are widely supported by IPA fonts while several Chinese varieties have more than one rising or falling tone. One common workaround is to retain standard IPA {{IPA|/ɔ̌/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ̂/}} for high-rising (/35/) and high-falling (/53/) tones and to use the subscript diacritics {{IPA|/ɔ̗/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ̖/}} for low-rising (/13/) and low-falling (/31/) tones.

[[Hangul]] included tone marks for [[Middle Korean]] tones. However, [[Gyeongsang Dialect]] Korean, which is used in Southeastern regions of [[South Korea]], are known to have a strong influence coming from tones.

Standard Central [[Thai language|Thai]] has five tones–mid, low, falling, high and rising–often indicated respectively by the numbers zero, one, two, three and four. The [[Thai alphabet|Thai written script]] is an [[abugida|alphasyllabary]], which specifies the tone unambiguously. Tone is indicated by an interaction of the initial consonant of a syllable, the vowel length, the final consonant (if present), and sometimes a tone mark. A particular tone mark may denote different tones depending on the initial consonant.

[[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] uses the Latin alphabet, and the six tones are marked by [[diacritic]]s above or below a certain vowel of each syllable. In many words that end in [[diphthong]]s, however, the vowel marked depends on the writer's style. Notation for Vietnamese tones are as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto"

The Latin-based [[Hmong language|Hmong]] and [[Iu Mien language|Iu Mien]] alphabets use full letters for tones. In Hmong, one of the eight tones (the {{IPA|˧}} tone) is left unwritten while the other seven are indicated by the letters ''b, m, d, j, v, s, g'' at the end of the syllable. Since Hmong has no phonemic syllable-final consonants, there is no ambiguity. That system enables Hmong speakers to type their language with an ordinary Latin-letter keyboard without having to resort to diacritics. In the [[Iu Mien language|Iu Mien]], the letters ''v, c, h, x, z'' indicate tones but unlike Hmong, it also has final consonants written before the tone.

===North America===
Several North American languages have tone, one of which is [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]], an [[Iroquoian language]]. Oklahoma Cherokee has six tones (1 low, 2 medium, 3 high, 4 very high, 5 rising and 6 falling).&lt;ref name="Cherokee"/&gt;

In Mesoamericanist linguistics, /1/ stands for high tone and /5/ stands for low tone, except in [[Oto-Manguean]] languages for which /1/ may be low tone and /3/ high tone. It is also common to see acute accents for high tone and grave accents for low tone and combinations of these for contour tones. Several popular orthographies use {{angle bracket|j}} or {{angle bracket|h}} after a vowel to indicate low tone.
[[Southern Athabascan languages]] that include the [[Navajo language|Navajo]] and [[Apache languages]] are tonal, and are analyzed as having two tones: high and low. One variety of [[Hopi language|Hopi]] has developed tone, as has the [[Cheyenne language]].

The Mesoamerican language stock called [[Oto-Manguean]] is famously tonal and is the largest language family in [[Mesoamerica]], containing languages including [[Zapotec language|Zapotec]], [[Mixtecan languages|Mixtec]], and [[Otomi language|Otomí]], some of which have as many as five register tones ([[Trique language|Trique]], [[Usila Chinantec]]){{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and others only two ([[Matlatzinca language|Matlatzinca]] and [[Chichimeca Jonaz language|Chichimeca Jonaz]]). Other languages in Mesoamerica that have tones are [[Huichol language|Huichol]], [[Yukatek Maya language|Yukatek Maya]], [[Tzotzil language|the Tzotzil of San Bartolo]], [[Uspantek language|Uspanteko]], and one variety of [[Huave language|Huave]].

===South America===

Many languages of South America are tonal. For example, various analyses of the [[Pirahã language]] describe either two or three tones{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. The [[Ticuna language]] isolate is exceptional for having five register tones (the only other languages in the Americas to have such a system are Trique and Usila, mentioned above).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Europe===
[[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] have simple word tone systems, often called [[pitch accent]] (although they are actually contour tones), appearing only in words of two or more syllables. Each word has a lexical tone, which varies by dialect.  Words whose pronunciation differs only in tone are frequently [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] or [[etymology|etymologically]] unrelated and may be spelled differently, as in Norwegian ''cider'' ('cider'), ''sider'' ('sides'). The two word tones are conventionally called ''[[:no:Tonelag|tonelag]];'' ''tonem 1'' and ''tonem 2'' in Norway and [[acute accent]] and [[grave accent]] in Sweden. In Norway, there are two major dialectal divisions based on tone, roughly eastern and western/northern, where the tones have different values: in the east, T1 = level low, T2 = falling; in the west/north, T1 = falling, T2 = rising-falling.

In [[Limburgish language|Limburgish]] and [[Central Franconian dialects]], tones can also occur in monosyllabic words: ''dáág'' ('day'), ''dáàg'' ('days'). Limburgish is typically a two-tone system, distinguishing between level high and falling, but the tones can be realized in other ways depending on syntax, and some vowels diphthongize or monophthongize under certain tones. Depending on the dialect, [[Latvian language|Latvian]] has a two-, three- or four-tone system.

==Orthographies==
In Roman script orthographies, a number of approaches are used. Diacritics are common, as in [[pinyin]], but they tend to be omitted.&lt;ref name=Dungan/&gt; [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] uses a combination of redundant consonants and diacritics. Tone letters may also be used, for example in [[Hmong RPA]] and several minority languages in China. Tone may simply be ignored, as is possible even for highly tonal languages: for example, the Chinese navy has successfully used toneless pinyin in government telegraph communications for decades. Likewise, Chinese reporters abroad may file their stories in toneless pinyin. [[Dungan language|Dungan]], a variety of Mandarin Chinese spoken in Central Asia, has, since 1927, been written in orthographies that do not indicate tone.&lt;ref name=Dungan&gt;[http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/dungan.html ''Implications of the Soviet Dungan Script for Chinese Language Reform'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ndyuka language|Ndjuka]], in which tone is less important, ignores tone except for a negative marker. However, the reverse is also true: in the Congo, there have been complaints from readers that newspapers written in orthographies without tone marking are insufficiently legible.

==Number of tones==
Languages may distinguish up to five levels of pitch, though the [[Chori language]] of Nigeria is described as distinguishing six surface tone registers. Since tone contours may involve up to two shifts in pitch, there are theoretically 5 × 5 × 5 = 125 distinct tones for a language with five registers. However, the most that are actually used in a language is a tenth of that number.

Several [[Kam–Sui languages]] of southern China have nine contrastive tones, including contour tones. For example, the [[Kam language]] has 9 tones: 3 more-or-less fixed tones (high, mid and low); 4 unidirectional tones (high and low rising, high and low falling); and 2 bidirectional tones (dipping and peaking). This assumes that [[checked syllable]]s are not counted as having additional tones, as they traditionally are in China. For example, in the traditional reckoning, the [[Kam language]] has 15 tones, but 6 occur only in syllables closed with /p/, /t/ or /k/, and the other 9 occur only in syllables not ending in one of these sounds.

Preliminary work on the [[Wobe language]] of Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire and the [[Chatino language]]s of southern Mexico suggests that some dialects may distinguish as many as fourteen tones, but many linguists believe that many of these will turn out to be sequences of tones or prosodic effects.

==Origin==

{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}

{{Sound change}}
[[André-Georges Haudricourt]] established that Vietnamese tone originated in earlier consonantal contrasts and suggested similar mechanisms for Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;The seminal references are {{harvp|Haudricourt|1954}} and {{harvp|Haudricourt|1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now widely held that Old Chinese did not have phonemically contrastive tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haudricourt|first1=André-Georges|title=How to reconstruct Old Chinese (translation of: Comment reconstruire le chinois archaïque)|journal=Word|date=1954|volume=10|issue=2/3|pages=351–364|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01631479|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical origin of tone is called ''tonogenesis,'' a term coined by [[James Matisoff]]. Tone is frequently an [[areal feature (linguistics)|areal]] rather than a genealogical feature: a language may acquire tones through bilingualism if influential neighboring languages are tonal or if speakers of a tonal language shift to the language in question and bring their tones with them. In other cases, tone may arise spontaneously and surprisingly quickly: the dialect of [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] in Oklahoma has tone, but the dialect in North Carolina does not although they were [[Trail of Tears|separated only in 1838.]]

Very often, tone arises as an effect of the loss or [[phonemic merger|merger]] of consonants. (Such trace effects of disappeared tones or other sounds have been nicknamed [[Cheshirisation]], after the lingering smile of the disappearing Cheshire Cat in ''[[Alice in Wonderland]].'') In a nontonal language, [[voiced consonant]]s commonly cause following vowels to be pronounced at a lower pitch than other consonants. That is usually a minor phonetic detail of voicing. However, if consonant voicing is subsequently lost, that incidental pitch difference may be left over to carry the distinction that the voicing had carried and thus becomes meaningful (phonemic). That happened in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: the Punjabi [[breathy voice|murmured]] (voiced aspirate) consonants have disappeared and left tone in their wake. If the murmured consonant was at the beginning of a word, it left behind a low tone; at the end, it left behind a high tone. If there was no such consonant, the pitch was unaffected; however, the unaffected words are limited in pitch and did not interfere with the low and high tones. That produced a tone of its own, mid tone. The historical connection is so regular that Punjabi is still written as if it had murmured consonants, and tone is not marked. The written consonants tell the reader which tone to use.

Similarly, final [[fricative]]s or other consonants may phonetically affect the pitch of preceding vowels, and if they then [[lenition|weaken]] to {{IPA|[h]}} and finally disappear completely, the difference in pitch, now a true difference in tone, carries on in their stead. This was the case with Chinese. Two of the three tones of [[Middle Chinese]], the "rising" and the "departing" tones, arose as the [[Old Chinese]] final consonants {{IPA|/ʔ/}} and {{IPA|/s/ → /h/}} disappeared, while syllables that ended with neither of these consonants were interpreted as carrying the third tone, "even". Most varieties descending from Middle Chinese were further affected by a [[tone split]] in which each tone divided in two depending on whether the initial consonant was voiced. Vowels following a voiced consonant ([[depressor consonant]]) acquired a lower tone as the voicing lost its distinctiveness.

The same changes affected many other languages in the same area, and at around the same time (AD 1000–1500). The tone split, for example, also occurred in [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and the [[Lhasa]] dialect of [[Central Tibetan language|Tibetan]].

In general, voiced initial consonants lead to low tones while vowels after aspirated consonants acquire a high tone. When final consonants are lost, a glottal stop tends to leave a preceding vowel with a high or rising tone (although glottalized vowels tend to be low tone so if the glottal stop causes vowel glottalization, that will tend to leave behind a low vowel). A final fricative tends to leave a preceding vowel with a low or falling tone. Vowel phonation also frequently develops into tone, as can be seen in the case of Burmese.

Tone arose in the [[Athabascan languages]] at least twice, in a patchwork of two systems. In some languages, such as [[Navajo language|Navajo]], syllables with glottalized consonants (including glottal stops) in the [[syllable coda]] developed low tones, whereas in others, such as [[Slavey language|Slavey]], they developed high tones, so that the two tonal systems are almost mirror images of each other. Syllables without glottalized codas developed the opposite tone. For example, high tone in Navajo and low tone in Slavey are due to contrast with the tone triggered by the glottalization.

Other Athabascan languages, namely those in western Alaska (such as [[Koyukon language|Koyukon]]) and the Pacific coast (such as [[Hupa language|Hupa]]), did not develop tone. Thus, the Proto-Athabascan word ''{{IPA|*tuː}}'' ('water') is toneless ''{{IPA|toː}}'' in Hupa, high-tone ''{{IPA|tó}}'' in Navajo, and low-tone ''tù'' in Slavey; while Proto-Athabascan ''{{IPA|*-ɢʊtʼ}}'' ('knee') is toneless ''{{IPA|-ɢotʼ}}'' in Hupa, low-tone ''{{IPA|-ɡòd}}'' in Navajo, and high-tone ''{{IPA|-ɡóʔ}}'' in Slavey. {{Harvcoltxt|Kingston|2005}} provides a phonetic explanation for the opposite development of tone based on the two different ways of producing glottalized consonants with either [[tense voice]] on the preceding vowel, which tends to produce a high F0, or [[creaky voice]], which tends to produce a low F0. Languages with "stiff" glottalized consonants and tense voice developed high tone on the preceding vowel and those with "slack" glottalized consonants with creaky voice developed low tone.

The [[Bantu languages]] also have "mirror" tone systems in which the languages in the northwest corner of the Bantu area have the opposite tones of other Bantu languages.

Three [[Algonquian languages]] developed tone independently of one another and of neighboring languages: [[Cheyenne language|Cheyenne]], [[Arapaho language|Arapaho]], and [[Kickapoo language|Kickapoo]]. In Cheyenne, tone arose via vowel contraction; the long vowels of Proto-Algonquian contracted into high-pitched vowels in Cheyenne while the short vowels became low-pitched. In Kickapoo, a vowel with a following [h] acquired a low tone, and this tone later extended to all vowels followed by a fricative.

In [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], a glottal stop can disappear in a combination of [[morpheme]]s, leaving behind a long falling tone. Note that it has the reverse effect of the postulated rising tone in Mandarin Chinese, derived from a lost final glottal stop.

{{Selfref|Regarding the use–mention distinction when writing Wikipedia articles, see {{section link|Wikipedia:Text formatting|Words as words}} and {{section link|Wikipedia:Writing better articles|Use of "refers to"}}.}}

The '''use–mention distinction''' is a [[foundational]] concept of [[analytic philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler (2005) p. 568&lt;/ref&gt; according to which it is necessary to make a [[Dichotomy|distinction]] between {{em|using}} a word (or phrase) and {{em|mentioning}} it,&lt;ref name="Devitt99"&gt;Devitt and Sterelny (1999) pp. 40–1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suine40p24"&gt;[[W.V. Quine]] (1940) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and many philosophical works have been "vitiated by a failure to distinguish use and mention".&lt;ref name="Devitt99"/&gt; The distinction is disputed by non-analytic philosophers.&lt;ref name="Derrida77p79"/&gt;

The distinction between use and mention can be illustrated for the word ''cheese'':&lt;ref name="Devitt99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suine40p24"/&gt;
* ''Use'': Cheese is derived from milk.
* ''Mention'': 'Cheese' is derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''ċēse''.

The first sentence is a statement about the substance called "cheese"; it &lt;em&gt;uses&lt;/em&gt; the word 'cheese' to refer to that substance. The second is a statement about the word 'cheese' as a [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]]; it &lt;em&gt;mentions&lt;/em&gt; the word without &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; it to refer to anything other than itself.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}

In written language, '''mentioned''' words or phrases often appear between [[quotation mark]]s (as in {{" '}}Chicago' contains three vowels") or in [[italics]] (as in "When I say ''honey'', I mean the sweet stuff that bees make"), and style authorities such as ''[[Strunk and White]]'' insist that mentioned words or phrases must always be made visually distinct in this manner. '''Used''' words or phrases (much more common than mentioned ones) do not bear any typographic distinction. In spoken language, or in absence of the use of stylistic cues such as quotation marks or italics in written language, the audience must identify mentioned words or phrases through semantic and pragmatic cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Shomir|title=A Computational Theory of the Use-Mention Distinction in Natural Language|url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/11694|publisher=Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Maryland|accessdate=16 February 2013|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If quotation marks are used, it is sometimes the practice to distinguish between the quotation marks used for speech and those used for mentioned words, with double quotes in one place and single in the other:
* When Larry said, "That has three letters," he was referring to the word 'bee'.
* With reference to 'bumbershoot', Peter explained that "The term refers to an umbrella."

A few authorities recommend against such a distinction, and prefer one style of quotation mark to be used for both purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Butcher's Copy-Editing: the Cambridge Handbook for Editors, Copy-editors and Proofreaders.'' 4th edition, by Judith Butcher, Caroline Drake and Maureen Leach. Cambridge University Press, 2006. Butcher's recommends against the practice, but ''The Chicago Manual of Style'', section 7.58 (15th edition, 2003), indicates that "philosophers" use single quotes for a practice akin to the use/mention distinction, though it is not explained in this way.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In philosophy ==
The general phenomenon of a term's having different [[references]] in different contexts was called ''[[Supposition Theory|suppositio]]'' (substitution)  by medieval logicians.&lt;ref&gt;See Read, Stephen (2006). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/medieval-terms Medieval Theories: Properties of Terms]. In [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]].&lt;/ref&gt; It describes how one has to substitute a term in a sentence based on its meaning—that is, based on the term's referent. In general, a term can be used in several ways. For nouns, they are:
* Properly with a ''[[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] and real referent'': "That is my ''pig''" (assuming it exists). (personal supposition)
* Properly with a ''concrete but unreal referent'': "Santa Claus's pig is very big." (also personal supposition)
* Properly with a ''generic referent'': "Any ''pig'' breathes air." (simple supposition)
* Improperly by way of ''metaphor'': "Your grandfather is a ''pig''". (improper supposition)
* As a ''pure term'': "''Pig'' has only three letters". (material supposition)

The last sentence contains a mention example.

The use–mention distinction is especially important in [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quotation|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quotation/#2.2|date=16 July 2005|accessdate=5 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to properly distinguish use from mention can produce false, misleading, or [[meaningless statement]]s or [[category error]]s. For example, the following correctly distinguish between use and mention:
* "Copper" contains six letters, and is not a metal.
* Copper is a metal, and contains no letters.

The first sentence, a mention example, is a statement about the word "copper" and not the chemical element. Notably, the word is composed of six letters, but not any kind of metal or other tangible thing.  The second sentence, a use example, is a statement about the chemical element copper and not the word itself. Notably, the element is composed of 29 electrons and protons and a number of neutrons, but not any letters.

[[Stanisław Leśniewski]] was perhaps the first to make widespread use of this distinction and the [[fallacy]] that arises from overlooking it, seeing it all around in analytic philosophy of the time, for example in Russell and Whitehead's ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simons|first=Peter|title=[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], 2nd edition|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Gale|isbn=0-02-866072-2|edition=e-book|authorlink=Peter Simons (academic)|editor=Borchert, Donald M|page=292|chapter=Leśniewski, Stanisław}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the logical level, a use–mention mistake occurs when two heterogeneous levels of meaning or context are confused inadvertently.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

{{anchor|both use and mention}}
[[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] told that in his student years, "quotation was usually introduced as a somewhat shady device, and the introduction was accompanied by a stern sermon on the sin of confusing the use and mention of expressions". He presented a class of sentences like
{{quote|Quine said that "quotation has a certain anomalous feature."}}
which both use the meaning of the quoted words to complete the sentence, and mention them as they are attributed to [[W. V. Quine]], to argue against his teachers' hard distinction. His claim was that quotations could not be analyzed as simple expressions that mention their content by means of [[proper name|naming]] it or [[definite description|describing]] its parts, as sentences like the above would lose their exact, twofold meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF00126690| issn = 0040-5833| volume = 11| issue = 1| pages = 27–40| last = Davidson| first = Donald| title = Quotation| journal = Theory and Decision| accessdate = 8 December 2010| date = March 1979| url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/v234l47038554624/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-reference|Self-referential]] statements mention themselves or their components, often producing logical [[paradox]]es, such as [[Quine's paradox]]. A mathematical analogy of self-referential statements lies at the core of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] ([[diagonal lemma]]). There are many examples of self-reference and use–mention distinction in the works of [[Douglas Hofstadter]], who makes the distinction thus:

{{quote|When a word is used to ''refer'' to something, it is said to be being ''used''. When a word is ''quoted'', though, so that someone is examining it for its surface aspects (typographical, phonetic, etc.), it is said to be being ''mentioned''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Metamagical Themas |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas R. |year=1985 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the standard notation for mentioning a term in philosophy and logic is to put the term in quotation marks, issues arise when the mention is itself of a mention. Notating using italics might require a potentially infinite number of typefaces, while putting quotation marks within quotation marks may lead to ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Logic, Logic, and Logic |last=Boolos |first=George |authorlink=George Boolos |year=1999 |page=398 |quote=In this 1995 paper, Boolos discussed ambiguities in using quotation marks as part of a [[formal language]], and proposed a way of distinguishing levels of mentioning using a finite number of marks, using "′" to modify the succeeding "°", as in:&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;According to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. Quine]],&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;Whose views on quotation are fine,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;&amp;#8195;°Boston° names Boston,&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;&amp;#8195;and ′°°Boston°′° names °Boston°, &lt;!-- sic; for more explanation, you must read the paper --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;#8195;But 9 doesn't designate 9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analytic philosophers have said the distinction "may seem rather pedantic".&lt;ref name="Devitt99" /&gt;

In a 1977 response to analytic philosopher [[John Searle]], [[Jacques Derrida]] mentioned the distinction as "rather laborious and problematical".&lt;ref name="Derrida77p79"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ANhg9zaAtIC&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Derrida |year=1977 |p=79 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Langues de la France1.gif|upright=1.4|thumb|The ''Valdôtain'' among the regional languages of France.]]

'''Valdôtain''' is a [[dialect]] of [[Arpitan]] (Franco-Provençal) spoken in the [[Aosta Valley]] in [[Italy]]. It is commonly known (in the local orthography) as ''[[patois|patoué]]''.

== Diffusion ==
The Aosta Valley represents nowadays the only region of the [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]] area where this language is still widely spoken as native by all age ranges of the population.

==Some words ==
Several subdialects of Valdôtain exist that exhibit unique features in terms of phonetics and vocabulary.

==Linguistic studies==
Valdôtain has been the subject of detailed study at the [[Bureau régional pour l'ethnologie et la linguistique]] (BREL) in [[Aosta]] as well as in the [[Centre d'études francoprovençales]] in [[Saint-Nicolas, Aosta Valley|Saint-Nicolas]].

==Music==
The main modern singers and songwriters in Valdôtain are:
*[[Louis de Jyaryot]], from [[Ayas, Aosta Valley|Ayas]];
*[[Maura Susanna]], from [[Saint-Vincent, Aosta Valley|Saint-Vincent]];
*[[Magui Bétemps]], from [[Valtournenche]].

The traditional Aostan songs in Valdôtain and in French form the core of the activity of the band [[Trouveur valdotèn]].

== Poetry ==
Here is a selection of some of the most important poets in Valdôtain:
