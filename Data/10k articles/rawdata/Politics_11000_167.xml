      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7446">In October 1937 there was a mass extermination of [[Belarus]]ian writers, artists and statespeople by [[USSR|Communist]] authorities. This event marks the peak of the [[Great Purge]] and [[Soviet repressions in Belarus|repressions]] in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-controlled [[East Belarus]].

More than 100 notable persons were executed, most of them on the night of 29-30 October 1937. Their innocence was later admitted by the [[Soviet Union]] after [[Joseph Stalin]]'s death.

==History==
On 7 September 1937 [[Joseph Stalin]] signed a list of persons to be judged by a Soviet Military commission. The list was also signed by [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich]], [[Klim Voroshilov]] and [[Nikolay Yezhov]]. The results of the trials related to persons from the Belarusian SSR were formulated in a different list dated 15 September 1937 and signed by Stalin, Molotov and the senior state security official [[Vladimir Tsesarsky]]. The list of people from the Belarusian SSR sentenced to execution included 103 persons, six more persons were sentenced to ten and more years of concentration camps.

The initial list was extended by the [[NKVD]] of the Belarusian SSR. People added to the list by the NKVD of Belarus are marked with an asterisk (*) in the list below.  The executions took place in the [[Minsk]] [[Amerikanka|internal NKVD prison (known as the Amerikanka)]]. Journalist [[Leanid Marakou]] alleged that between 3 March 1937 and 22 May 1938, over 100,000 people fell victims of repressions by the Soviet authorities.

The '''1999 Baltimore Orioles&amp;nbsp;– Cuban national baseball team exhibition series''' consisted of two [[exhibition game]]s played between the [[Baltimore Orioles]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) and the [[Cuban national baseball team]] on March 28 and May 3, 1999. The first game took place in [[Havana]], while the second was held in [[Baltimore]]. This series marked the first time that the Cuban national team had faced a squad composed solely of major league players and the first time an MLB team played in Cuba since 1959.

In the 1990s, Orioles' owner [[Peter Angelos]] lobbied the [[United States Government]] to gain permission to hold this series for three years. Various politicians, including members of the [[United States House of Representatives]], opposed the idea and attempted to block the series. Eventually, Angelos secured the approval in 1999, after a change in United States foreign policy to Cuba under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]], which eased travel restrictions and increased cultural exchange.

The Orioles won the first game, which was held in Havana, by a score of 3–2 in [[extra inning]]s. The Cuban national team defeated the Orioles 12–6 in the second game, which was held in Baltimore. The series introduced [[José Contreras]] to the American baseball audience; Contreras defected from Cuba in 2002 to pitch in MLB. The United States and Cuba now compete with each other and other nations in the [[World Baseball Classic]].

==Background==
The [[Cuban Revolution]] led to the overthrow of [[Fulgencio Batista]], an ally of the [[United States]], in 1959. [[Fidel Castro]] severed [[Cuba]]'s formerly strong ties with the United States. The United States soon instituted an [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo against Cuba]], which has made it illegal for United States corporations to enter into business with Cuba. The [[Baltimore Orioles]], who were slated to hold a 1960 exhibition series against the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in Havana, moved the games to [[Miami]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iddaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MmwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5147,4597069&amp;dq=baltimore+cuba+exhibition&amp;hl=en|title=Orioles Move Havana Exhibitions to Miami: Cuban Sports Writers Irked Over Shift of Three-Game Series With Cincinnati|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=March 29, 1960|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) team had played in Cuba since March 21, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/1999/03/28/orioles990328.html |title=Baltimore Orioles beat Cuba all-stars  |publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=March 3, 1999|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro made attempts to lure American baseball teams back to Cuba to no avail. In the 1970s, [[George McGovern]], a [[United States Senator]], pushed the idea of an exchange of MLB and [[college basketball]] teams as a way to bridge the impasse between the two governments, similar to the [[ping-pong diplomacy]] that aided [[US-China relations]]; however, this was blocked by the [[United States Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aEwfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=etEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=613,3426682&amp;dq=major-league-baseball+cuba&amp;hl=en|agency=Associated Press|title=Baseball Diplomacy Failed Before|newspaper=[[Daytona Beach Morning Journal]]|page=7A|date=May 10, 1975|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, [[Scott Armstrong (journalist)|Scott Armstrong]] attempted to convince [[Edward Bennett Williams]], then the owner of the [[Baltimore Orioles]], to play a game of Cuban All-Stars against his Orioles. Williams declined, as he had a position on an advisory board in the [[Reagan Administration]], which opposed having any business with Cuba. Armstrong discussed the idea with [[MLB Commissioner]] [[Bart Giamatti]] and [[MLB Players Association]] (MLBPA) chair [[Donald Fehr]]. Though Giamatti was interested, he died before he could pursue the idea. Fehr visited Cuba during the [[1994-95 MLB strike]], but could not secure an antitrust exemption.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;

In 1996, [[Peter Angelos]], the new owner of the Orioles, met with Armstrong and [[Saul Landau]], who convinced him to pursue an exhibition series between his Orioles and the [[Cuban national baseball team]].&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Ginsburg|agency=Associated Press|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/02/sports/sp-33359 |title=Angelos 'Dominant' Force Behind Cuba-Orioles Series|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 2, 1999|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angelos petitioned the [[United States Government]] to permit a series. [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] wrote to the State Department, asking that the series be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pnYwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BTcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6331,9784633&amp;dq=baltimore+cuba+exhibition&amp;hl=en|title=Official opposes Orioles plan to visit Cuba|newspaper=Rome News-Tribune|date=April 3, 1997|accessdate=March 15, 2013|page=2-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of the Treasury]] denied Angelos' request on the grounds that American money may not be spent in Cuba under the [[Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sun_sentinel/access/14692576.html?dids=14692576:14692576&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+04%2C+1997&amp;author=The+Associated+Press&amp;pub=South+Florida+Sun+-+Sentinel&amp;desc=CUBAN+EXHIBITION+DENIED&amp;pqatl=google |title=Cuban Exhibition Denied |agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] |page=6.C|date=April 4, 1997 |accessdate=March 15, 2013}} {{subscription required|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1999, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] eased travel restrictions and increased cultural exchange between the United States and Cuba, leading Angelos to again seek permission to play an exhibition game in Cuba.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SAEC&amp;p_theme=saec&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAFE89424DF0AF7&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Orioles owner planning exhibitions with Cubans|newspaper=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |agency=Associated Press|date=January 18, 1999 |accessdate=March 15, 2013}} {{subscription required|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angelos met with [[Sandy Berger]], Clinton's [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], to discuss a potential exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/1999/01/29/oth_251713.shtml |title=Angelos wants Clinton's help to save Orioles-Cuba games |newspaper=[[The Augusta Chronicle]] |date=January 29, 1999|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bud Selig]], the MLB Commissioner, allowed for the exploration of the series, though it still required the approval of MLB owners and the MLBPA.&lt;ref name=sun_exhibition&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-01-10/sports/9901090010_1_league-baseball-major-league-rafael-palmeiro |first=Peter|last=Schmuck|authorlink=Peter Schmuck|title=O's-Cuba exhibition needs to fly for charity's sake |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=January 10, 1999 |accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MLBPA insisted on a second game to be held in the United States.&lt;ref name=nyt_set&gt;{{cite news|first=Murray|last=Chass|authorlink=Murray Chass|date=March 15, 1999 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/15/sports/baseball-spring-training-baltimore-cuba-game-2-of-series-set-for-may-3.html |title=Baseball: Spring Training&amp;nbsp;– Baltimore-Cuba; Game 2 of Series Set for May 3 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contingent of United States Representatives, including Ros-Lehtinen, [[Robert Menendez]], [[Dan Burton]], [[Lincoln Diaz-Balart]], and [[Rick Lazio]], lobbied Fehr to try to block the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1999-02-05/sports/25502176_1_cuban-doctors-cuban-officials-cuban-people |title=Congress Calls On Fehr About O's-cuba Game |work=[[Philly.com]] |publisher=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=February 5, 1999 |accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rigoberto Herrera]], a member of the Cuban national team who had retired and accompanied the team from Cuba as a guest, defected to the United States during the visit.

[[File:AAAA4577 José Contreras.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[José Contreras]] pitching for the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 2008]]
To discourage defections during the exhibition in Baltimore, Cuba maintained strict security around their young players, not allowing [[agent (sports)|sports agents]] to speak with them.&lt;ref name="Castro Welcomes Stars Home"/&gt; Though no active Cuban players defected during the trip to Baltimore, members of the Cuban national team did defect in the years following the series.

MLB and the [[Major League Umpires Association]] engaged in a dispute regarding the amount of pay owed to umpires for officiating the game that took place in Baltimore. This was one factor that led to the [[1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation|mass resignation]] of MLB umpires that took place on September 2, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/15/sports/baseball-umpires-threaten-to-quit-on-sept-2.html|title=Baseball; Umpires Threaten To Quit On Sept. 2|first=Murray|last=Chass|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 15, 1999|accessdate=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Syd Thrift]], the Orioles' [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]], told ''[[The Washington Times]]'' that the team had a practice of not signing players who had defected from Cuba, which he attributed to Angelos' desire to avoid doing "anything that could be interpreted as being disrespectful or ... encouraging players to defect". Investigations by Major League Baseball and the [[United States Department of Justice]] did not find evidence that the absence of Cuban players on the Orioles' roster or in its minor league system was due to discrimination.&lt;ref name=espn2002&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2002/1110/1458871.html |work=ESPN.com|title=Bud passes the buck on Cuba |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |date=July 16, 2003|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2001/aug/17/20010817-024844-7964r |title=Probe of Orioles finds no violations |newspaper=[[Washington Times]] |date=August 17, 2001|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3739">'''Americentrism''' is the tendency among some [[Americans]] to assume the [[American culture|culture of the United States]] is more important than those of other countries or to judge foreign cultures based on the standards within their own. It refers to the practice of [[worldview|viewing the world]] from an overly US-focused perspective, with an implied belief, either consciously or subconsciously, in the [[preeminence]] of American culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguist.org.cn/doc/uc200803/uc20080316.pdf |title=Analysis of ethnocentrism |last=NI |first=Chun-yan |year=2008 |work=US-China Foreign Language |volume=6 |issue=2 |page=78 |accessdate=March 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203113215/http://www.linguist.org.cn/doc/uc200803/uc20080316.pdf |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is not to be confused with [[American exceptionalism]], which is the assertion that the United States is qualitatively different from other nations and is often accompanied by the notion that the United States has superiority over every other nation.&lt;ref name="amerExcep"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=812lbix0oH4C&amp;pg=PA18 ''American Exceptionalism: A Double-Edged Sword.''] Seymour Martin Lipset.

The '''Artaman League''' ([[German language]]: '''Artamanen-Gesellschaft''') was a German [[agrarianism|agrarian]] and [[völkisch]] movement dedicated to a ''[[Blood and Soil|Blood and soil]]''–inspired ruralism. Active during the inter-war period, the League became closely linked to, and eventually absorbed by, the [[Nazi Party]].

==Etymology==
The term ''Artamanen'' had been coined before the First World War by Dr. [[Willibald Hentschel]], a believer in racial purity who had founded his own group, the Mittgart Society, in 1906. The term was a [[Compound_(linguistics)|compound noun]] of ''art'' and ''manen'', [[Middle High German]] words meaning 'agriculture man', and indicating Hentschell's desire to see Germans retreat from the decadence of the city in order to return to an idyllic rural past.&lt;ref name="Padfield37"&gt;Peter Padfield, ''Himmler: Reichs Führer-SS'', Cassell &amp; Co, 2001, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Artaman League had its roots in the overall [[Lebensreform]] movement in late 19th-century and early 20th-century Germany. This movement encompassed hundreds of groups throughout Germany that were involved in various experiments tied to ecology, health, fitness, [[vegetarianism]], and [[naturism]] (''Nacktkultur''). These groups held positions across the political spectrum. The far-right groups ultimately gained a following among the Nazi Party members and their supporters. Publications by right wing Lebensreformists, which sold in the tens of thousands,  argued that their practices were "the means by which the German race would regenerate itself and ultimately prevail over its neighbours and the diabolical Jews who were intent on injecting putrefying agents into the nation's blood and soil".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|isbn=1-932595-11-2|pages=138–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H1215-503-009, Walther Darré bei einer Kundgebung.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walther Darré]] speaking at a ''Reichsnährstand'' assembly under the slogan '[[Blut und Boden]]' (blood and soil) in [[Goslar]], 1937]]

Although Hentschel had developed his ideas before World War I, the Artaman League first formed in 1923.&lt;ref name="Padfield37"/&gt; The Artamans formed part of the [[German Youth Movement]], representing its more [[right-wing]] [[back-to-the-land]] elements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinz Höhne]], ''The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS'', Penguin Books, 2000, pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of [[Georg Kenstler]] they advocated [[blood and soil | blood-and-soil]] policies with a strong undercurrent of [[anti-Slavism]].&lt;ref name="Hohne47"&gt;Höhne, ''The Order of the Death's Head'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; This [[völkisch movement]] believed that the decline of the [[Aryan race]] could only be halted by encouraging people to abandon city life in favour of settling in the rural areas in the east.&lt;ref name="Read"&gt;Anthony Read, ''The Devil's Disciples'', Pimlico, 2004, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst members wished to perform agricultural labour as an alternative to military service, they also saw it as part of their duty to violently oppose [[Slavs]] and to drive them out of Germany.&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;Louis Leo Snyder, ''Encyclopedia of the Third Reich'', Wordsworth, 1998, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  The concepts were combined in the figure of the [[Wehrbauer]], or soldier-peasant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heather Pringle]], ''The Master Plan:  Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'', p39 {{ISBN|0-7868-6886-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, the League sent German youth to work on the land in [[Saxony]] and in [[East Prussia]] in an attempt to prevent these areas being settled by [[Poles]].&lt;ref name="Read"/&gt; To this end 2000 settlers were sent to Saxony in 1924 - both to work on farms and to serve as an anti-Slav militia.&lt;ref name="Hohne47"/&gt;  They also gave classes on the importance of racial purity and the Nordic race, and on the corrupting influence of city living and of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Pringle, ''The Master Plan:  Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'', p39-40 {{ISBN|0-7868-6886-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many similar right-wing youth movements in Germany the Artaman League lost impetus as the Nazi Party grew.  By 1927, 80% of its membership had become Nazis.&lt;ref name="pringle40"&gt;
Heather Pringle, ''The Master Plan:  Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'', p40 {{ISBN|0-7868-6886-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The League had disappeared by the early 1930s, with most of its membership having switched to the Nazis.&lt;ref name="Snyder"/&gt;

==Nazi links==
[[File:Himmler45.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Heinrich Himmler]] in 1945]]
As the situation deteriorated in the late 1920s, some of the Artamans were drawn deeper into politics, and engaged in a holy war against their enemies: liberals, democrats, Free-Masons and Jews.&lt;ref name="LePage"/&gt; Eventually many members of the Artaman League turned to National Socialism. [[Heinrich Himmler]] was an early member and held the position of ''Gauführer'' in [[Bavaria]]. Whilst a member of the League Himmler met [[Richard Walther Darré]] and the two struck up a close friendship, based largely on Darré's highly developed ideological notions of [[blood and soil]] to which Himmler was attracted.&lt;ref name="Hohne47"/&gt; The Artaman vision would continue to have a profound effect on Himmler who, throughout his time as [[Reichsführer-SS]], retained his early dreams of a racially pure peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;Höhne, ''The Order of the Death's Head'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Himmler was also close to his fellow member [[Rudolf Höss]] and would later advance him in the [[Schutzstaffel]] due in part to their history in the Artaman League.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power'', Penguin Books, 2006, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The small league was dismantled and incorporated into the Hitler Jugend in October 1934 as the Nazi youth movement gained strength.&lt;ref name="LePage"&gt;LePage, Jean-Denis, ''The Hitler Youth, 1922-45: An Illustrated History'' (London: MacFarland, 2009), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The development of a number of environmentalist groups and projects in Germany with extreme right wing politics has recently gained media attention. Since the 1990s, far-right environmentalists have taken advantage of cheap farmland made available by the post-Cold War reunification of East and West Germany, establishing themselves in [[Mecklenburg]], "in an effort to reinvigorate the traditions of the Artman League".&lt;ref name="Connolly"&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Kate|title=German far-right extremists tap into green movement for support|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/28/germany-far-right-green-movement|accessdate=April 29, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state government of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] has published a booklet titled ''Nature Conservation vs Rightwing Extremism'' in an effort to assist organic farmers who may encounter rightwing extremists. Gudrun Heinrich of the University of Rostock has published a study, ''Brown Ecologists'', in reference to both the current movement and the Nazi [[Sturmabteilung|Brownshirts]]. The politically extreme rightwing environmental magazine ''Umwelt und Aktiv'' (Environment and Active), is believed to receive support from Germany's far-right National Democratic party (NPD).&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt; ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' has covered the "organic brown fellowship" ("Braune Bio-Kameradschaft"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pfaffinger|first=Von Christian|title=Braune Bio-Kameradschaft|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,814893,00.html|date=April 3, 2012|work=Der Spiegel|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' has published an article on and the “infiltration [''Unterwanderung''] of organic farming by rightwing extremists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Thiele, Von Christian |author2=Marlene Weiss |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Unterwanderung des Biolandbaus durch Rechtsextreme: Idylle in Grün-Braun|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/unterwanderung-des-biolandbaus-durch-rechtsextreme-idylle-in-gruen-braun-1.1332321|date=April 13, 2012|work=Süddeutsche Zeitung|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting the lineage to Nazi doctrines of Aryan supremacy and ecological harmony.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4099">An '''authorization to transport''' [ATT] is a permit issued under the [[Canadian Firearms Program]] allowing transportation of restricted and prohibited firearms in Canada. An ATT may be issued to a firearms licensee, or to a non-resident of Canada not possessing a firearms licence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/pub/bsf5044-eng.html#P010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613200414/http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/pub/bsf5044-eng.html |date=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 19 of the Firearms Act (FA) details the various reasons for transportation which may be approved by the chief provincial firearms officer (CFO).    
    
While not a specific requirement under the Firearms Act, ATTs issued for regular trips for up to five years are usually reserved for people who belong to an approved shooting range. Under the Firearms Act, section 67, a CFO considering a licence renewal must confirm whether a restricted firearm or prohibited handgun is being used by the licence holder for the legitimate reasons found in FA section 28. In order to prove one has a licence to permit target shooting, regular trips to the gun range or club must be made, and repeated one-time ATTs would be a waste of resources. In contrast, a gun collector under FA section 30 might transport firearms occasionally, thus a one-time ATT would make sense.

In theory, a CFO should issue an ATT to any authorized individual who provides one of the listed reasons, as long as the CFO is satisfied that the transport "will not endanger public safety". A CFO can impose a variety of conditions on an ATT, under section 58(1) of the Firearms Act. Exercise of this discretion has led to proposed litigation against the CFO in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/politics/archives/2013/01/20130128-153941.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714172046/http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/politics/archives/2013/01/20130128-153941.html |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In order to transport a restricted or prohibited firearm it must be unloaded. It also must have a functional [[trigger lock]] and be kept in a locked opaque case. Ammunition may be carried with the firearm or separately stored, provided it is not loaded in the gun (i.e., magazines may contain ammo, but may not be loaded in the firearm).

Restricted firearms include, but are not limited to, [[handguns]].  All handguns are, at a minimum, restricted in Canada. Many handguns (common in the United States) are prohibited firearms in Canada, as their barrel length is 105&amp;nbsp;mm or less, or they are a prohibited calibre (.25 and .32).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-42.html#h-37 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714155318/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-42.html |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill C-42 amended the Firearms Act, which caused ATTs to become a condition of a licence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/bulletins/bus-ent/20150619-91-eng.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; "Authorizations to Transport become a condition of a licence for certain routine and lawful activities such as target shooting; taking a firearm home after a transfer; going to a gunsmith, gun show, a Canadian port of exit; or a peace officer or a Chief Firearms Officer (CFO) for verification, registration or disposal". Effective September 2, 2015, these changes to the Firearms Act came into force meaning an ATT became a condition of a licence for the foregoing routine and lawful activities. In other words, an ATT is automatically included into any valid RPAL licence.

==Etymology==
There are two slightly differing, but related, etymologies for the origin of the term:

One common etymology is that BIGOT is a reversal of the codewords "TO GIB", meaning "To [[Gibraltar]]". The context of this etymology is the Allied [[North African Campaign|invasion of North Africa]] in November 1942: "TO GIB" was stamped on the orders of military and intelligence staff travelling from Britain to North Africa to prepare for the operation.&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0206/feature1/ |title=Untold Stories of D-Day |first=Thomas B. |last=Allen |journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of personnel made a dangerous journey by sea, through areas patrolled by German U-boats, however certain individuals whose contribution to the campaign or whose mission was vital were classified "BIGOT", and were flown to Africa on a safer route via Gibraltar.&lt;ref name="spycraft"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Melton |first1=H.

Several sources state that BIGOT was a codeword for [[Operation Overlord]], the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]]' plan to invade German-occupied western Europe during [[World War II]], and that the term was an acronym for "British Invasion of German Occupied Territory".&lt;ref name="hotw"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Fitzgerald |first=Tony |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/dc7Vms21Qz6Q4xiqgS37xQ |title=BIGOT security classification stamp |website=A History of the World |publisher=BBC/The British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Ronald Fitzgerald |first=Tony |last=Fitzgerald |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/25/ronald-fitzgerald-obituary |newspaper=The Guardian |date=25 August 2011 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term "BIGOT", used to designate the highest level of military secrecy, appeared on amphibious operations planning documents prior to Operation Overlord. See, for example, the BIGOT map created for use in Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, which took place in 1943, preceding Operation Overlord, which occurred in 1944. This map is referenced on the British Imperial War Museum site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/publication/120304 |title=Bigot - Husky most secret : [map] |website=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible that the term itself, supposedly suggested by [[Winston Churchill]], was a "[[backronym]]"—a phrase created to fit an [[acronym]] such as the existing "To Gibraltar" code.

The list of personnel cleared to know details of Overlord was known as the BIGOT list, and the people on it were known as "Bigots". The details of the invasion plan were so secret, adherence to the list was rigidly enforced. U.S. military advisor [[George Elsey]] tells a story in his memoirs about how a junior officer turned away [[George VI|King George VI]] from the intelligence centre on the {{USS|Ancon|AGC-4|6}}, because, as he explained to a superior officer "...nobody told me he was a Bigot."&lt;ref name=natgeo /&gt;&lt;ref name="elsey"&gt;{{cite book |last=Elsey |first=George |authorlink=George Elsey |title=An Unplanned Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7jZ3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA52 |accessdate=9 December 2011 |year=2005 |publisher=University of Missouri Press |isbn=0-8262-1622-6 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although both derivations are of British origin, the term is widely used in the United States intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=Bruce |first2=Susan M. |last2=Watson |first3=Gerald W. |last3=Hopple |title=United States intelligence: an encyclopedia |year=1990 |publisher=Garland |isbn=0-8240-3713-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert C. "Bob" Mants, Jr.''' (April 25, 1943 – December 7, 2011) was an American civil rights activist, serving as a field secretary for the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC). He helped lead [[Selma to Montgomery marches|the voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery]]; he was standing in the second rank (with [[Albert Turner (civil rights activist)|Albert Turner]], behind [[Hosea Williams]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]]) on [[Bloody Sunday (1965)|Bloody Sunday]]. After Selma, Mants moved to [[Lowndes County, Alabama|Lowndes County]], working for civil rights for the remainder of his life. Lowndes County contained the majority of the distance covered by the Selma to Montgomery march, and was then notorious for its racist violence.

==Early life==
Mants was born in [[East Point, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=Legacy /&gt; He graduated in 1961 from East Point/South Fulton High School,&lt;ref name=Legacy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sncclegacyproject.org/robert-c-mants-jr |title=Robert "Bob" Mants (1943–2011) |author=Kranz, Sharlene |date=7 December 2011 |publisher=SNCC Legacy Project |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a segregated black high school. While he was attending high school, Mants was a member of the [[Committee on Appeal for Human Rights]] (which would later develop into the [[Atlanta Student Movement]]) and volunteering for administrative tasks at the headquarters of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee,&lt;ref name=Legacy /&gt; two blocks from his home.&lt;ref name=SNCC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://snccdigital.org/people/bob-mants/ |title=Bob Mants: April 25, 1943–December 7, 2011; Raised in Atlanta, Georgia |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012 |website=SNCC Digital |publisher=Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would go on to attend [[Morehouse College]] with the intention of majoring in medicine,&lt;ref name=SNCC /&gt; but left without graduating, working in 1964 with SNCC in [[Americus, Georgia]]. Afterwards, he would move on to Lowndes County in early 1965.&lt;ref name=Legacy /&gt;

While in Americus, Mants reported over the [[Wide Area Telephone Service]] that "negro and white" mobs were forming on the evening of July 6, 1964, possibly in response to riots the evening before or the integration of two downtown restaurants earlier in the day, which had occurred without incident. Mants was working to calm and disperse the mobs. An hour later, Mants reported a drive-by shooting with no reported injuries or deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://cdm15932.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15932coll2/id/24020 |title=King—July, 1964 WATS Line Calls |author=King, Mary E. |date=1962–1999 |publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society: Freedom Summer Collection |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mants and [[Stokely Carmichael]] from the SNCC first arrived in Selma to participate in the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march;&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt; in photographs of Bloody Sunday taken by [[Spider Martin]], Mants can be seen wearing a patterned cap, marching next to Albert Turner just behind John Lewis after crossing the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spidermartin.com/image-gallery/x3g93wop9oi0brr0tjwp54kfsoas96 |title=1/5 'Selma 1965 Bloody Sunday': Hosea Williams and John Lewis leading marchers over the Alabama River |author=Martin, Spider |date=7 March 1965 |publisher=Spider Martin |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spidermartin.com/image-gallery/rxtx0c3nbgkjd4gn6gkdr6uzxvel9h |title=1/7 'Two Minute Warning': Hosea Williams and John Lewis confront troopers on Bloody Sunday |author=Martin, Spider |date=7 March 1965 |publisher=Spider Martin |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; earlier that morning, Mants had participated in a prayer at the [[Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church (Selma, Alabama)|Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church]], where the march originated, with John Lewis, Hosea Williams, and [[Andrew Young]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stevenkasher.com/exhibitions/selma-march-1965?view=slider#2 |title=Bob Mants, John Lewis, Hosea Williams and Andrew Young with Brown's Chapel AME Church in the Background |author=Martin, Spider |date=7 March 1965 |publisher=Steven Kasher Gallery |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the violent suppression on Bloody Sunday, Mants saved a woman from a possible beating and took her away from the tear gas cloud.&lt;ref name=AlBenn /&gt;

While marching to Montgomery in late March 1965, Mants was passing out buttons and leaflets when a resident of Lowndes County, pleased the civil rights movement was coming to her, memorably quoted [[Revelation 7]]:9 to him.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt; In 1964, Lowndes County had no registered black voters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/14/us/ex-black-militant-gets-life-for-murdering-deputy.html |title=Ex-Black Militant Gets Life for Murdering Deputy |author=Firestone, David |date=14 March 2002 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the county's population was predominantly black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/05/us/a-selma-march-relives-those-first-steps-of-65.html |title=A Selma March Relives Those First Steps of '65 |author=Smothers, Ronald |date=5 March 1990 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=21 February 2017 |quote=Two months after Bloody Sunday, Robert Mants said as he marched today, an organization he was in got to work in nearby Lowndes County, which was 81 percent black and had fewer than 30 black registered voters and no black elected officials.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The county was known as "Bloody Lowndes" or the rusty buckle of the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt of Alabama]] because of its long, violent history of whites retaliating against blacks who tried to register to vote.&lt;ref name=BloodyLowndes&gt;{{cite book |url=https://nyupress.org/books/9780814743317/ |title=Bloody Lowndes: Civil Rights and Black Power in Alabama's Black Belt |author=Jeffries, Hasan Kwame |date=August 2010 |isbn=978-0-81474-331-7 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York, New York |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite interview |subject=Bob Mants |interviewer=Carroll Blue |date=18 October 1988 |publisher=Washington University Libraries, Film and Media Archive, Henry Hampton Collection |accessdate=21 February 2017 |title=Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965 to 1985 |url=http://digital.wustl.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=eop;cc=eop;rgn=main;view=text;idno=man5427.0175.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Mants and other SNCC officials began to register black voters,&lt;ref name=AlBenn /&gt; the newly registered voters, many of which still lived on plantations, were made homeless by the predominantly white landowners.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt; Many of the displaced black residents were housed in a temporary "Tent City" and subject to intimidation over the next two years as shots were regularly fired into the encampment.&lt;ref name=SNCC /&gt; In response, SNCC set up the [[Alabama Poor People's Land Fund]] to purchase plots of land and building materials to help the displaced black residents to build new homes.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt;

SNCC also tried a new strategy in Lowndes County, setting up the [[Lowndes County Freedom Organization]] (LCFO) in 1966 as an independent Black political party, adopting a snarling black panther as its logo. LCFO would in turn inspire other leaders, such as Stokely Carmichael, who adopted the structure of LCFO for [[Black Power]], and [[Bobby Seale]] and [[Huey P. Newton]], who adopted the black panther logo for the [[Black Panther Party]].&lt;ref name=BloodyLowndes /&gt;

Mants remained in Lowndes County after the march, saying "if there was any place I wanted to raise my kids, it would be here, because they could see black people moving forward, advancing ourselves as a race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/02/us/in-selma-everything-and-nothing-changed.html?pagewanted=all |title=In Selma, Everything and Nothing Changed |author=Applebome, Peter |date=2 August 1994 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mants served as a farm management specialist at [[Tuskegee University]].&lt;ref name=AlBenn /&gt; In 1984, Mants was elected to the Lowndes County Commission, unseating a white incumbent, and served one term.&lt;ref name=SNCC /&gt;&lt;ref name=AlBenn /&gt;

In 2000, Mants opposed the creation of a landfill along [[U.S. Route 80]], the highway taken by marchers in the third Selma to Montgomery march, calling it "an insult." As head of Lowndes County Friends of the Trail, he noted "you can't commemorate [the route of the march] on the one hand and desecrate it on the other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/02/us/at-odds-in-alabama-over-a-landfill-on-a-historic-trail.html |title=At Odds in Alabama Over a Landfill on a Historic Trail |author=Sengupta, Somini |date=2 October 2000 |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also lobbies on a range of social policy issues such as [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]] from an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestant]] perspective, and has been particularly influential with [[Democratic Unionist Party]] ministers in the [[Northern Ireland Executive]].&lt;ref name="Clarke2"&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120902014242/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/creationist-bible-group-and-its-web-of-influence-at-stormont-16205034.html "Creationist Bible group and its web of influence at Stormont"], Liam Clarke, ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' 1 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation describes its mission as "promoting the fundamentals of the historic evangelical Protestant faith".&lt;ref name="CF"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.calebfoundation.org/ | publisher = Calebfoundation.org | title = Caleb Foundation website | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150307200052/http://www.calebfoundation.org/ | archivedate = 7 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure, leadership and influence==
The Foundation was launched at a meeting held in the Park Avenue Hotel, [[Belfast]] on 16 October 1998,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.takeheed.net/News_From_The_Front/news8.htm ''News from the Front''], Take Heed Ministries, December 1998&lt;/ref&gt; following an initial meeting in Ballymoney in February 1998 attended by delegates from a number of small evangelical Protestant churches. It is not a membership organisation.&lt;ref name="Clarke2"/&gt;

The Foundation is led by a "Council of Reference" including ministers, pastors and other activists from a variety of small Protestant sects. The largest single denomination represented is the [[Free Presbyterian Church (Ulster)|Free Presbyterian Church]] founded by Rev. [[Ian Paisley]],&lt;ref name="CF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NL interview"/&gt; with others including the [[Congregational church#Ireland|Congregational Union of Ireland]], the [[Evangelical Presbyterian Church (Ireland)|Evangelical Presbyterian]], [[Methodism#Ireland|Independent Methodist]], [[Association of Baptist Churches in Ireland|Baptist]], [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland|Reformed Presbyterian]], [[Congregational Reformed Church|Congregational Reformed]] and [[Elim Pentecostal Church|Elim Pentecostal]] churches, the [[Church of the Nazarene]] and the Evangelical Protestant Society. Prominent members of the Council (in 2012) include [[Ron Johnstone]], who succeeded Paisley as leader of the Free Presbyterian Church; DUP MLA [[Mervyn Storey]], also a Free Presbyterian; Philip Campbell, Convenor of the Public Morals Committee of the Congregational Union, and Free Presbyterian minister Alan Smylie,&lt;ref name="CF"/&gt; who conducted the funeral service for [[Shankill Butchers|Shankill Butcher]] [[Robert Bates (loyalist)|Robert Bates]].&lt;ref&gt;Steve Bruce, ''Paisley: Religion and Politics in Northern Ireland'', Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first chairman, until his death in 2007, was [[George Dawson (Northern Ireland politician)|George Dawson]], an activist in Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and subsequently a DUP [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (Northern Ireland)|MLA]]. Dawson was Grand Master of the [[Independent Orange Order]] and Treasurer of the [[Evangelical Protestant Society]].&lt;ref name="BCSE"/&gt; On his death, Rev. William Park became acting chairman.&lt;ref name="CF"/&gt; Its secretary for some time after the launch in 1998, David McConaghie acted until late 2012 as its press spokesman, and held other offices in the Foundation's Council of Reference. Wallace Thompson of the Evangelical Protestant Society, who had been the Foundation's treasurer since 1998,&lt;ref name="CF"/&gt; succeeded as chairman of the Foundation in September 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/exdup-adviser-to-lead-evangelical-group-of-lobbyists-14512725.html?startindex=20 ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]''] news report, 28 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Park becoming vice-chairman.&lt;ref name="CF"/&gt; Thompson, who was a founding member of the DUP, is also an [[Orange Order|Orangeman]], a former [[Northern Ireland Office]] civil servant, and a former ministerial adviser to [[Nigel Dodds]]. It was while employed in the last role, in 2008, that Thompson in a radio interview denounced the [[Pope]] as the [[Antichrist]].&lt;ref name="NL interview"/&gt; Thompson is a member of the Public Morals Committee of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church.&lt;ref name="BCSE"/&gt; The secretary of the Foundation is Rev. Philip Campbell, Congregational minister in Coleraine. who replaced Rev Robert McEvoy in June 2013. This change formed part of an organisational re-structuring of the Foundation with the establishment of a steering committee which is empowered to make decisions and respond to events.

Documenting the influence of the Foundation within Northern Ireland [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] politics, and particularly the DUP, the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' noted in 2012 that politicians close to it included Northern Ireland [[Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety|health minister]] [[Edwin Poots]], [[Minister for Social Development]] [[Nelson McCausland]], junior minister [[Jonathan Bell (politician)|Jonathan Bell]], [[Diane Dodds]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], [[Gregory Campbell (politician)|Gregory Campbell]] [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]], [[David Simpson (Northern Ireland politician)|David Simpson]] MP, [[Paul Givan]] MLA, [[Stephen Moutray]] MLA (and mayor of [[Craigavon]]), [[Jim Allister]], leader of [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] and TUV press officer and [[East Antrim (UK Parliament constituency)|East Antrim]] parliamentary candidate Sammy Morrison.&lt;ref name="Clarke2"/&gt; A leading ''Belfast Telegraph'' journalist wrote on another occasion that "Caleb plays a role within the DUP analogous to the old [[Militant tendency]] within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] party."&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/opinion/why-good-book-could-be-bad-news-for-dup-14832896.html] Liam Clarke, "Why Good Book could be bad news for DUP", ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'', 7 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2012, the ''[[Irish Daily Star]]'' noted that Caleb "claims a support base of 200,000 evangelicals" and asked whether it had "overtaken the Orange Order as the most influential pressure group within Unionism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/Daily_Star/arts2012/sep17_Caleb_Foundation__JCoulter_Star.php "Caleb Foundation is on a mission"], John Coulter, ''[[Irish Daily Star]]'', n.d. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The Foundation's lobbying to have public bodies give at least equal coverage to creationist beliefs as to scientific evidence of [[evolution]] came to attention in 1999, when McConaghie wrote in the Belfast ''[[News Letter]]'' in response to the [[BBC]] television series ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'', calling for "equal prominence to be given to the Creation creed".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61078631.html Archive link] to David McConaghie, "How did it all begin?", ''[[News Letter]]'', 19 October 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 McConaghie met senior officers of the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] to discuss the Foundation's request that figures for 'gay-on-gay' violence in Northern Ireland be collated and published, and that police figures for 'cohabiting same-sex' domestic violence be made available to the Foundation "for analysis".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoominfo.com/CachedPage/?archive_id=0&amp;page_id=2001716842&amp;page_url=//www.calebfoundation.org/page16.htm Cached version of Caleb website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the Foundation's spokesman called for the banning of the Belfast [[Pride parade|Gay Pride parade]], complaining of the "gratuitously offensive and deliberately provocative behaviour emanating from participants".&lt;ref&gt;"Clergyman urges others to join Gay Pride march", ''[[News Letter]]'', 4 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2008, the Foundation's website carried a photograph of a shop window display in [[Enniskillen]] and asked: "Is one of Northern Ireland's leading clothes chains promoting homosexuality?", pointing out "a pair of female mannikins [sic.] in the window of their Enniskillen store, holding hands."&lt;ref&gt;Archived version of http://www.calebfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation lobbied the [[Ulster Museum]] in 2010 to feature creationist theories in its displays. The Foundation wrote to DUP minister [[Nelson McCausland]] and to [[Ulster Museum|National Museums Northern Ireland]] to express their concerns about the Museum's Nature Zone exhibits which described evolution as fact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ni/2010/05/creationism_and_the_ulster_mus.html "Creationism and the Ulster Museum"], [[BBC Northern Ireland]], 28 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt; McCausland subsequently wrote to the Museum trustees calling for alternative views of the origin of the universe to be accommodated in the museum's natural history displays.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/jun/19/creationism-northern-ireland ''[[The Guardian]]''], 19 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[British Centre for Science Education]] published an 11,000-word report which accused the Foundation of promoting [[Christofascism|Christian fascism]] and [[Dominionism]], aiming to make Northern Ireland a "fundamentalist Protestant theocracy".&lt;ref name="BCSE"&gt;[http://www.bcseweb.org.uk/index.php/Main/CalebFoundation [[British Centre for Science Education]]] report on Caleb, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011-12 the Foundation's press officer, David McConaghie, by then a full-time DUP official, lobbied two DUP ministers in the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] - McCausland and [[Arlene Foster]] - to have creationist theories included in displays at the new visitor centre at the [[Giant's Causeway]].&lt;ref name="NL interview"/&gt; The lobbying involved other DUP members and evangelical churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/dup-aide-quizzed-over-toilet-camera-16238776.html [[Belfast Telegraph]]] news report, 16 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daily"&gt;[http://www.belfastdaily.co.uk/2012/11/16/dup-spy-aide-arrested-and-quizzed-over-covert-toilet-camera-device/ Belfastdaily.co.uk] news report, 16 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Trust]] included a "younger Earth" version of the origins of the Giant's Causeway at the visitor centre.&lt;ref name="ITimes"/&gt; In July 2012 McConaghie welcomed this as "recognition of the view, held by scientists right across the spectrum, that the scientific evidence points to a much younger age of the universe and to the direct involvement of a Divine Creator."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/david-mcconaghie-causeway-creationist-feature-promotes-healthy-debate-1-4038102 ''[[The News Letter]]''], 10 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, following widespread objections to the creationist content, the National Trust removed the display in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-19814284&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation has also lobbied for more representation by evangelical churches on [[BBC Northern Ireland]], and in opposition to the relaxation of Sunday trading laws,&lt;ref name="NL interview"/&gt; the extension of gay rights, Sunday sport,&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt; a [[Marie Stopes International|Marie Stopes]] clinic in Belfast and [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name="ITimes"/&gt; McConaghie met senior personnel from education bodies to lobby for the inclusion of a creationist viewpoint in the Northern Ireland curriculum.&lt;ref name="ITimes"&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1116/breaking34.html [[The Irish Times]]] news report, 16 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues on which the Caleb Foundation has lobbied include the reform of prostitution laws, raising the retail price of alcohol and limiting pub opening hours, opposing the review of the [[abortion law]]s to include rape and foetal abnormality, and banning of [[LGBT adoption|gay adoption]]. While it did not specifically lobby for a ban on [[blood donation]] by gay men, it "approved of the position of the minister" Edwin Poots in retaining the ban.&lt;ref name="Clarke2"/&gt;

In November 2012 the Caleb Foundation announced that McConaghie had "voluntarily stepped down" from his role as its press officer, after he was arrested and charged with concealing a camera in a toilet cubicle for purposes of sexual gratification.&lt;ref name="CF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/northern-ireland-mp-former-aide-davidmcconaghie-arrested-over-toilet-camera-8323672.html [[The Independent]]], 16 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/exdup-aide-david-mcconaghie-appears-in-court-charged-with-voyeurism-30611606.html [[Belfast Telegraph]]], 24 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishnews.com/news/2015/12/17/news/ex-dup-adviser-david-mcconaghie-s-appeal-dismissed-356322/ [[The Irish News]]], 16 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, McConaghie who used a secret camera to spy on women in toilet, was convicted of voyeurism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/no-reaction-no-explanation-and-no-apology-as-dup-aide-david-mcconaghie-who-used-a-secret-camera-to-spy-on-women-in-toilet-is-convicted-of-voyeurism-31480991.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lord President of the Court of Session's Mace - geograph.org.uk - 991449.jpg|thumb|A court official holds the mace of the [[Lord President of the Court of Session]], Scotland, during a [[Doors Open Day]]. Also known as the Old Exchequer Mace, it was made in London in 1667, of silver gilded with [[24 carat]] gold, and weighs around 8&amp;nbsp;kg (17&amp;nbsp;lb).]]

A '''ceremonial mace''' is a highly ornamented staff of metal or wood, carried before a [[Head of state|sovereign]] or other high official in civic ceremonies by a [[mace-bearer]], intended to represent the official's authority. The mace, as used today, derives from the original [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]] used as a weapon. Processions often feature maces, as on parliamentary or formal academic occasions.

== History ==
[[File:Masse de chancelier Louis XIV saint-Louis 376.JPG|thumb|200px|Head of a French ceremonial mace, 18th century]]

The earliest ceremonial maces were practical weapons intended to protect the king's person, borne by the [[Sergeant-at-Arms|Sergeants-at-Arms]], a royal bodyguard established in France by [[Philip II of France|Philip II]], and in England probably by [[Richard I of England|Richard I]], (c. 1180){{citation needed|date=May 2018}}. By the 14th century, these sergeants' maces had started to become increasingly decorative, encased in precious metals. As a weapon, the mace fell out of use with the disappearance of heavy armor.

The history of the civic mace (carried by the sergeants-at-arms) begins around the middle of the 13th century, though no examples from that period remain today. The oldest civic mace in England (still remaining today) is that of [[Hedon]]. It was granted (along with an important charter) in 1415.&lt;ref name="hedon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hedon.gov.uk/Core/Hedon-Town-Council/Pages/The_Hedon_Silver_1.aspx|publisher=Hedon Town Council|title=The Hedon silver|accessdate=19 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826161144/http://www.hedon.gov.uk/Core/Hedon-Town-Council/Pages/The_Hedon_Silver_1.aspx#|archive-date=2014-08-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, ornamented civic maces were considered an infringement of one of the privileges of the king's sergeants, who alone deserved to bear maces enriched with costly metals, according to a [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] petition of 1344. However, the sergeants of London later gained this privilege, as did later those of York (1396), Norwich (1403–1404), and Chester (1506). Records exist of maces covered with silver in use at Exeter in 1387–1388; Norwich bought two in 1435, and Launceston others in 1467 and 1468. Several other cities and towns subsequently acquired silver maces, and the 16th century saw almost universal use.

Early in the 15th century the flanged end of the mace (the head of the war mace) was carried uppermost, with the small button bearing the royal [[heraldry|arms]] in the base. By the beginning of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] period, however, the blade-like flanges, originally made for offence, degenerated into mere ornaments, while the increased importance of the end with the royal arms (afterwards enriched with a cresting) resulted in the reversal of the position. The custom of carrying the flanged end upward did not die out at once: a few maces, such as the [[Winchcombe]] silver maces, which date from the end of the 15th century, were made to be carried both ways. The [[Guildford]] mace provides one of the finest of the fifteen specimens of the 15th century.

[[File:WLA vanda Ceremonial Mace chob.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ceremonial mace (or "chob"), wood overlaid with mother-of-pearl; copper handle, c. 1600]]Craftsmen often pierced and decorated the flanged ends of the maces of this period beautifully. These flanges gradually became smaller, and by the 16th or early 17th century had developed into pretty projecting scroll-brackets and other ornaments, which remained in vogue until about 1640. The next development in the embellishment of the shaft was the reappearance of these small scroll-brackets on the top, immediately under the head of the mace. They disappear altogether from the foot in the last half of the 17th century, and remain only under the heads, or, in rarer instances, on a knob on the shaft. The silver mace-heads were mostly plain, with a cresting of leaves or flowers in the 15th and 16th centuries. In the reign of [[James I of England]] they began to be engraved and decorated with heraldic devices and similar ornamentation.

As the custom of having sergeants' maces began to die out about 1650, the large maces borne before the mayor or [[bailiff]]s came into general use. Thomas Maundy functioned as the chief maker of maces during the [[English Commonwealth]]. He made the mace for the House of Commons in 1649. This mace is still in use today, though without the original head. The original head, which was not engraved with regal symbols, was replaced by one with regal symbols at the time of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] of the monarchy. [[Oliver Cromwell]] referred to the House of Commons mace as "a fool's bauble" when he dissolved the [[Rump Parliament]] in 1653.

==Australia==
The ceremonial maces of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] and the [[Australian Senate]] symbolise both the authority of each chamber and the royal authority of [[Monarchy of Australia|Australia's monarch]].

===Senate===
The ceremonial mace of the Senate of Australia is the Black Rod. The ceremonial custodian of the Black Rod is the [[Usher of the Black Rod]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/briefs/brief16.htm|title=The Black Rod: History and role|accessdate =29 February 2008|publisher=The Senate of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Representatives===
The [[Sergeant-at-Arms]] of the Australian House of Representatives is the ceremonial custodian of the Mace of the House. At the beginning and end of every day the House sits, the Speaker of the House enters and leaves the House preceded by the Sergeant-at-Arms carrying the mace on his or her right shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Serjeant-at-Arms/History_and_role_of_the_Mace.aspx|title=History and role of the Mace|accessdate=10 April 2012|publisher=The Parliament of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Mace is made of gilded silver, and was a gift to the House from [[King George VI]] on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of [[Federation]] in 1951. It was presented to the House by a delegation of members of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Serjeant-at-Arms/History_and_role_of_the_Mace|title=Gift of the current Mace of the House by King George VI|accessdate=29 February 2008|publisher=The Parliament of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1914, Labor MP [[William Higgs]] played a practical joke on the House by hiding the mace under one of the opposition frontbenches. It was not found for two hours, and police were called in as it was assumed to have been stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/15510054|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|date=23 May 1914|title=THE STONEWALL}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially denying his role in the incident,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/15511340|title=MACE INCIDENT.|publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''|date=28 May 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higgs apologised to his colleagues the following week, stating he had acted in "a spirit of frivolity". His admission that he was "entirely to blame" was met with cheers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/26906491|publisher=''[[The West Australian]]''|date=29 May 1914|title=THE MACE INCIDENT.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahamas==
The ceremonial maces in the Bahamas symbolise both the authority of each chamber and the Royal authority of Elizabeth II, [[Monarchy of the Bahamas|the Queen of the Bahamas]].

On 27 April 1965, a day known in the Bahamas as "Black Tuesday", [[Lynden Pindling]], then Opposition Leader, threw the 165-year-old Speaker's Mace out of a [[Parliament of the Bahamas|House of Assembly]] window to protest against the unfair [[gerrymandering]] of constituency boundaries by the then ruling United Bahamian Party (UBP) government. The Speaker tried to restore order but he was reminded by Labour leader Randol Fawkes that the business of the House could not legally continue without the mace. The badly damaged mace was recovered by the Police and returned to the House.

On 3 December 2001, Cassius Stuart and Omar Smith, leader and deputy leader of the [[Bahamas Democratic Movement]], a minor political party, charged from the public gallery onto the floor of the House of Assembly and handcuffed themselves to the Mace in protest against "unfair gerrymandering" of constituency boundaries by the [[Free National Movement]] (FNM) government. The Mace was unable to be separated from the men and the sitting of the House had to be suspended. The pair were jailed for almost two days but no charges were brought against them.

==Canada==
[[File:Ceremonial mace, made in 1867 - Ontario Legislative Building, Toronto, Canada - DSC00276.jpg|thumb|upright|Made in 1867, the mace used in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] is made of gold-plated copper. The ceremonial mace of the Legislature is the fourth mace to be used in the Legislatures of Upper Canada and Ontario.]]
The ceremonial maces in the Canadian [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] and [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] embody the authority each chamber derives from [[Monarchy of Canada|the country's sovereign]]. 
The current mace in the Commons is the Fourth mace, a replica of the Third one destroyed by fire at the [[Centre Block]] in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Law Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1N4wAQAAIAAJ|volume=142|year=1917|publisher=Office of The Law Times|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar practice is employed in each of the [[Legislative Assemblies of Canadian provinces and territories|provincial and territorial legislatures]], with a mace representing the sovereign's authority and power in each of the respective legislatures.

===Protocol surrounding the mace===
In Canada, each of the legislatures follow a relatively standard protocol in relation to the ceremonial mace; the [[Speaker (politics)|speaker of the house]] normally enters following a mace-bearer (normally the [[Sergeant-at-Arms|sergeant-at-arms]]), who subsequently sets the mace on the clerks' table to begin the sitting. When the sergeant-at-arms removes the mace from the table, the House has either adjourned, recessed, or been resolved into a [[Committee of the Whole|committee of the whole]]. Before the reigning monarch or one of his or her representatives (the [[Governor General of Canada|governor general]] or one of the [[Lieutenant-Governor (Canada)|lieutenant governors]]) may enter a legislative chamber, the mace must be completely hidden from view. This is done by draping the mace in a heavy velvet cloth, a procedure performed by the house pages. During the election of the speaker, the mace is removed from the table to show that the house is not fully constituted until the new speaker takes the chair and the mace is laid on the table.

===History of the maces===
The first mace was used by the Chamber of [[Upper Canada]]'s first Parliament in 1792 at [[Newark, Upper Canada|Newark]] (now [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]]) and then moved to [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now [[Toronto]]).&lt;ref name=OntLA&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://speaker.ontla.on.ca/en/at-the-assembly/the-mace/ |title=The Mace|website=speaker.ontla.on.ca|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This first mace was a primitive wooden implement, painted red and gilt and surmounted by a crown of thin brass strips. It was stolen by American troops as a [[prize of war]] during the [[Battle of York]] of the [[War of 1812]] in 1813. The mace was stored at [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]] and remained in the United States until 1934 when it was returned to Ontario when President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] sent an order to Congress to return the mace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=14862|title=Franklin D. Roosevelt: Message to Congress Requesting Authority to Return a Mace to Canada.|website=www.presidency.ucsb.edu|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was stored at the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] for a time, and is now located in the Main Lobby of the [[Ontario Legislative Building]].&lt;ref name=OntLA/&gt;

A second mace was introduced in 1813 and used until 1841.

The third mace was not purchased until 1845. In 1849, when the Parliament for the [[United Provinces of Canada]] was sitting in [[Montreal]], it was stolen by a riotous mob, apparently intent upon destroying it in a public demonstration. It was rescued and returned to the Speaker, Sir [[Allan MacNab]], the next day. Later, in 1854, the Mace was twice rescued when the Parliament Buildings in Quebec were ravaged by fire. The Mace continued to be used by the [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada|Union Parliament]] in Toronto and Quebec until Confederation in 1867, when it was taken to the [[Parliament of Canada]] in Ottawa, where it remained in the House of Commons until 1916. When the Parliament Buildings were gutted by fire during that year, the Mace could not be saved from Centre Block. All that remained was a tiny ball of silver and gold conglomerate.&lt;ref name=OntLA/&gt;

Being a symbol of the power and authority of a legislative assembly, a precedent was set in 2002 as to the severity of acts of disrespect toward the mace in Canada and, by proxy, the monarch. After [[Keith Martin (politician)|Keith Martin]], federal Member of Parliament for [[Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca]], seized the ceremonial mace of the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] from the [[Clerk of the House of Commons (Canada)|clerk]]'s table on April 17, 2002, the [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|speaker]] of that chamber ruled that a ''[[prima facie]]'' breach of the privileges of the house had occurred,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/about/people/House/Speaker/rulings/ruling_3_1_7_e.html| last=Parliament of Canada| authorlink=Parliament of Canada| title=The Speaker &gt; House of Commons Canada &gt; Speaker's Rulings| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| date=22 April 2002| accessdate=12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contempt of the house been committed. Martin was not permitted to resume his seat until he had issued a formal apology from the bar of the house, pursuant to a motion passed in response to the incident.

===Parliament of Ontario===
The ceremonial mace of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Parliament of Ontario]] is the fourth mace to be used in [[Upper Canada]] or Ontario.

The first, second and third maces used in Ontario, are mentioned above, and were used by the Parliament of [[Upper Canada]] and [[Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada|Union Parliament]].

After [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], where the third mace moved with the new [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament of the Dominion of Canada]] to Ottawa. The current mace used in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] was acquired in 1867. It was provided by Charles E. Zollikofer of Ottawa for $200. The Four-foot mace is made of copper and richly gilded, a flattened ball at the butt end. Initially, the head of the mace bore the crown of Queen Victoria and in a cup with her monogram, V.R. When she was succeeded by Edward VII in 1901, her crown and cup were removed and a new one bearing Edward's initials on the cup was installed. Eventually, it was replaced with the current cup which is adorned in gleaming brass leaves.&lt;ref name=OntLA/&gt;

Through some careful detective work on the part of Legislative Assembly staff, the original cup with Queen Victoria's monogram was recently found in the [[Royal Ontario Museum]]’s collection and returned to the Legislature. It is now on display in the [[Ontario Legislative Building]].&lt;ref name=OntLA/&gt;

In 2009, two diamonds were installed in the Mace. The diamonds were a gift to the people of Ontario from De Beers Canada to mark the opening of the Victor Mine near Attawapiskat in northern Ontario. Three diamonds were selected from the first run of the mine. Two stones, one rough and one polished, were set in platinum in the crown of the Mace while the third stone, also polished, was put on exhibit in the lobby of the Legislative Building as part of a display about the history of the Mace.&lt;ref name=OntLA/&gt;

==Guyana==
The [[National Assembly (Guyana)|National Assembly]], the [[Unicameralism|sole chamber]] of the [[Parliament of Guyana]], has a ceremonial mace. In March 1991, Isahak Basir, a member of the [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]] (in opposition at the time), was expelled from parliament for removing the mace from its place on the table, and also for throwing his drinking glass at the Speaker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parliament.gov.gy/media-centre/speeches/sub-judice/#.VJGlysBAs Media Centre // Speeches in the National Assembly // Sub-Judice] – Parliament of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana. Retrieved 18 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
[[File:Galway mace.jpg|thumb|200px|The Great Mace of [[Galway]], [[Ireland]], presented to the city by [[Mayor of Galway|Mayor]] Edward Eyre in 1712. Next to it is the Civic Sword.]]
The silver gilt mace of the old [[Irish House of Commons]], which dates to 1765/1766 is now displayed in the old [[Irish House of Lords]] Chamber in the old [[Irish Houses of Parliament|Parliament House]] which since 1803 has been Bank of Ireland, College Green in Dublin. The silver gilt mace of the old [[Irish House of Lords]] is on permanent display at the National Museum, Collins Barracks.

City councils and universities in Ireland often possess a ceremonial mace.

==Philippines==
[[File:PHL House of the Representatives mace.jpg|thumb|75px|Mace of the House of Representatives]]
The [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] and the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] of the Philippines each have a respective mace. The maces are almost identical.&lt;ref name="HR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/about/index.php?about=symbols|title=Symbols of Power and Authority|accessdate=28 February 2011|publisher=House of the Representatives of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov.ph/about/symbols%20of%20authority.asp|title=Symbols of Authority|accessdate=28 February 2011|publisher=Senate of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mace of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] serves as a symbol of authority and in the custody of the [[Sergeant-at-Arms]]. It serves as a guarantee for the [[Sergeant-at-Arms]] in enforcing peace and order in the House upon the [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker's]] instruction. Upon every session, the mace is placed at the foot of the [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker's]] rostrum. The mace is topped by the official seal of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="HR"/&gt;

The [[Mace of the Philippine Senate|mace]] of the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] also serves as a symbol of authority. It is also displayed at the [[Senate President of the Philippines|Senate President's]] rostrum every session. As with the House of Representatives, the [[Sergeant-at-Arms]] also serves as the custodian of the mace. When there is disorderly conduct in the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]], the [[Sergeant-at-Arms]] brings the mace from its pedestal and presents it to the senators causing the disorder, a signal to stop such behavior. The official seal of the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] also tops the mace.&lt;ref name="S"/&gt;

==Sri Lanka==
The ceremonial jeweled mace, symbolizing the authority of the [[Parliament of Sri Lanka]], is kept in the custody of the [[Serjeant-at-Arms]]. The mace, when kept on its stand in the Chamber, signifies that the House is in session. At the commencement of a Session, the Serjeant-at-Arms bearing the mace accompanies the Speaker when entering and leaving the Chamber. The mace has to be legally brought into the House at the appointed time and removed at the end of the Session. Therefore, unauthorized removal of the mace cannot invalidate proceedings.


==United Kingdom==

There are ten large [[silver-gilt]] maces of the sergeants-at-arms kept as part of the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] in the [[Jewel House]] at the [[Tower of London]]. Two date from the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], two from the reign of [[James II of England|James II]], three from [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]]'s reign, and one from [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]'s reign (the [[royal cypher]] of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] has been added to the latter). All these are of a type almost universally adopted, with slight variations, at the Restoration. Each mace weighs an average of {{convert|10|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth J.

===Incidents with the Mace in the House of Commons===
In 1653, during the [[Rump Parliament#Oliver Cromwell|Rump Parliament]], Oliver Cromwell derided the mace as a "fools' bauble" and ordered his troops to take it away.

In 1930, [[John Beckett (politician)|John Beckett]], a member of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], was suspended from the House of Commons for showing disrespect to the mace by trying to leave the chamber with it as a protest against the suspension of another member; it was wrestled from his grip at the door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article33340967|title=Excitement in Commons: Members Seizes the Mace|newspaper=The West Australian|date=18 July 1930|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, [[Michael Heseltine]], a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], seized the mace from the table and held it above his head after Labour MPs on the government side started to sing "[[The Red Flag]]", the traditional anthem of the Labour Party, during a heated debate on the controversial [[Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977|Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill]], which nationalised large parts of the UK aerospace and shipbuilding industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/82544.stm |title=Mace – Commons|publisher=BBC News|date=9 October 2008|accessdate=12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, [[Ron Brown (Scottish politician)|Ron Brown]], Labour MP for [[Leith]], Scotland, picked up the mace during a debate on the so-called [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]] and threw it to the floor in protest at the government's proposals. The mace was damaged, and Brown was ordered to pay £1,500 towards the cost of repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/4/20090115/tuk-mace-protest-mp-suspended-dba1618.html |title=Mace protest MP suspended |publisher=Yahoo News|date=15 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119063225/http://uk.news.yahoo.com/4/20090115/tuk-mace-protest-mp-suspended-dba1618.html|archivedate=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[John McDonnell MP|John McDonnell]], Labour MP for [[Hayes and Harlington (UK Parliament constituency)|Hayes and Harlington]], in which [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]] is located, was suspended from the Commons after disrupting a debate on the proposed expansion of the airport. Following the Transport Secretary's announcement that the government had decided to approve a new runway without a vote in the Commons, McDonnell took the mace and dropped it on an empty bench. He was [[Naming (parliamentary procedure)|named]] by the Deputy Speaker and suspended from the Commons for five days for contempt of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7830937.stm |title=MP suspended after mace protest |publisher=BBC News|date=15 January 2009 |accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
The [[Lord Mayor of London]] is preceded by both a Mace Bearer and a Sword Bearer. This is only for his status as head of the [[City of London Corporation]]: as an alderman he is also accompanied, as are the other 25 aldermen, by his ward [[beadle]], carrying the ward mace. All are displayed and used on the City's eight grand ceremonial occasions of each year. There are many more maces in store than the current number in use, because each division of the wards and their parishes also had its own mace. The City also has a [[Crystal Sceptre]], not strictly a mace, made of crystal and gold set with pearls; the head dates from the 15th century, while the mounts of the shaft are older, dating from the early Middle Ages. These various maces take many forms and are from different periods, but most are no earlier than the Restoration of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]. A mace of a most unusual form from that period is that of the Tower Ward of London, whose head resembles the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] in the [[Tower of London]], complete with tiny cannons.

[[Mayor]]al and [[alderman]]ic maces are carried in ceremonial processions in other [[borough]]s and cities throughout England as symbols of the authority of the [[mayor]] or [[lord mayor]] and council, although the office of alderman has largely been abolished. A mace is commonly of silver gilt, the largest examples being the great maces of the cities of [[Oxford]],&lt;ref&gt;Oxford History: Mayors, etc.,: "The Mace Bearer" states "over five feet"; (www.oxfordhistory.org.uk).{{nonspecific|date=July 2017}}&lt;!-- Which page within this website? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winchester]],&lt;ref&gt;Winchester Civic Silver, etc.,: "The Great Mace" states "1.6 metres" (or 5 ft 3 inches) (www.winchester.gov.uk){{nonspecific|date=July 2017}}&lt;!-- Which page within this website? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].&lt;ref&gt;Newcastle Civic Insignia: "The Great Mace" states "4 ft 11 inches" (www.newcastle.gov.uk) {{nonspecific|date=July 2017}}&lt;!-- Which page within this website? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1663, Charles II presented a silver-gilt mace to the [[Royal Society]], which he founded in 1660. It is very similar to the maces used in the Houses of Parliament and has the royal cypher "C.R.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pictures.royalsociety.org/image-rs-8467|title=The Royal Society mace|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[livery companies]] have their own mace, as do [[List of county councils in England|county council]]s throughout England.

===Scotland===
The present [[Scottish Parliament]] has a silver mace, which was designed in 1999 and incorporates a gold [[wedding band|wedding ring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-99/pa0029.htm |title=Mace to go on display at Museum of Scotland|publisher=Scottish.parliament.uk|date=15 July 1999|archivedate=26 September 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926232944/http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/nmCentre/news/news-99/pa0029.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish Parliament was presented with this mace by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] at the opening ceremony on 1 July 1999. It was designed and crafted by Michael Lloyd, a renowned silversmith who has a studio in south-west Scotland. The mace is constructed of Scottish silver with an inlaid band of gold panned from Scottish rivers. The gold band is intended to symbolise the marriage of the Parliament, the land, and the people. The words "Wisdom, Justice, Compassion, Integrity" are woven into thistles at the head of the mace to represent the aspirations of the Scottish people for the Members of their Parliament. The head of the mace bears the words: "There shall be a Scottish Parliament – Scotland Act 1998".

The [[Lord President of the Court of Session|Lord President]]'s Mace (sometimes known as the Old Exchequer Mace) dates from 1667. It is made of gilt solid silver, measures 4&amp;nbsp;ft 8&amp;nbsp;inches and weighs 17&amp;nbsp;lb 5oz. In 1856, on the merging of the courts, it was transferred from the [[Court of Exchequer (Scotland)|Court of Exchequer]] to the First Division of the [[Court of Session]] to be used by the Lord President. The mace remains in daily use in the court. The mace, and lesser ones used in the other courts, are borne by Macers, officers of the court who act as assistants to the judges. The Lord President's Mace is borne by the Falkland Macer. A new mace was presented to the Court in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/5148684.stm |title=Queen presents new mace to judge|publisher=BBC News|date=5 July 2006|accessdate=12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The silver mace with crystal globe of the [[Treasurer of Scotland|Lord High Treasurer of Scotland]], at [[Holyrood Palace]], was made about 1690 by Francis Garthorne.

===Wales===
[[File:Mace at the Senedd.jpg|thumb|200px|National Assembly for Wales ceremonial mace]]
The [[National Assembly for Wales]] has a gold, silver and brass mace which bears the Assembly's official symbol at its head. The mace was presented to the assembly by the [[Parliament of New South Wales]] at the ceremony to mark the official opening of the Assembly Building, the [[Senedd]], in [[Cardiff]] on St David's Day in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblywales.org/sen-project-history-opening-plinth.htm#pic4|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205062327/http://www.assemblywales.org/sen-project-history-opening-plinth.htm|archivedate=5 February 2012|title=Opening the Senedd: On the Plinth|publisher=National Assembly for Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melbourne]] [[goldsmith]] Fortunato Rocca was commissioned in 2002 to design it. The mace took 300 hours to craft and is made of gold, silver and brass. In 2006, it was worth around £10,500 ([[Australian dollar|A$]]25,000) and was handed over to the National Assembly during the opening ceremony.&lt;ref name="mace"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4754894.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=New mace is gift from down under|accessdate=9 September 2008|date=1 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before then, the assembly used a glass, gold, iron and coal sculpture known as the "Tlws" as its mace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cywaithcymru.org/eng/archive_detail.php?projectsID=132|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927232415/http://www.cywaithcymru.org/eng/archive_detail.php?projectsID=132|archivedate=27 September 2007|title=The Tlws|publisher=Artworks Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tlws was presented to the assembly by the Queen at the official opening of the First Assembly in 1999 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/wales/story/0,,444362,00.html |title=Welsh crown day with a song|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 May 1999|accessdate=12 April 2009|author=Geoffrey Gibbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently resides in the Siambr Hywel debating chamber in the [[Tŷ Hywel]] building adjoining the [[Senedd]].

===Northern Ireland===
Some district councils in Northern Ireland, e.g. [[Belfast]], also meet with maces present.

==United States==
[[Image:USmace.jpg|thumb|The Mace of the US House of Representatives]]
{{See also|Mace of the Virginia House of Delegates}}
The civic maces of the 18th century follow the British type, with some modifications in shape and ornamentation, but most (with the exception of Virginia and South Carolina) incorporate republican imagery as opposed to the monarchical imagery of the previous maces, although arguably imperial Roman imagery is what most influenced their form. Examples of English silver maces in North America include one dating to 1753 at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], and the mace of the [[South Carolina|state of South Carolina]], dating to 1756. The Maryland House of Delegates also has a very old ceremonial mace, although it is the plainest of all, having no ornamentation save some carved vegetation designs at its head. (In addition, there are two maces in [[Jamaica]], made in 1753 and 1787; one belonging to the colony of [[Grenada]], made in 1791, and the Speaker's Mace at [[Barbados]], dating from 1812.)

The current [[Mace of the United States House of Representatives]] has been in use since December 1, 1842. It was created by William Adams at a cost of $400 to replace the first mace, which was destroyed on August 24, 1814 when the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] was destroyed in the [[burning of Washington]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] during the [[War of 1812]]. A simple wooden mace was used in the interim.

The current mace is nearly four feet tall and is composed of 13 [[ebony]] rods tied together with silver strands criss-crossed over the length of the staff. This design shows the staff with the appearance of a bundled [[fasces]], sans ax, symbolizing unity, the rods representing the 13 original States. It is surmounted by a [[Globe|globus]], symbolising dominion, and above that the [[American eagle]] with outstretched wings.

When the House is in session, the mace stands in a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] [[pedestal]] of green [[marble]] to the right of the chair of the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]. When the House is meeting as the [[Committee of the Whole (United States House of Representatives)|Committee of the Whole]], the mace is moved to a pedestal next to the desk of the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives|Sergeant at Arms]]. Thus Representatives entering the chamber know with a glance whether the House is in session or in committee.

In accordance with the [[Procedures of the United States House of Representatives|Rules of the House]], when a Member becomes unruly the Sergeant at Arms, on order of the Speaker, lifts the mace from its pedestal and presents it before the offenders, thereby restoring order. This occurs very rarely.

==Churches==
Among other maces (more correctly described as [[Sceptre|staves]]) in use today are those carried before [[ecclesiastical]] dignitaries and [[clergy]] in [[cathedral]]s and some parish churches. Other churches, particularly churches of the [[Anglican Communion]], a [[verger]] ceremoniously precedes processions.

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]] maces used to be carried before [[Popes]] and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Mace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universities==

Ceremonial maces, symbols of the internal authority over members and the independence from external authority, are still used at many educational institutions, particularly universities. The [[University of St Andrews]] in Scotland has three maces dating from the 15th&amp;nbsp;century. The university also has four other maces of a more recent origin. These are on permanent display at the [[Museum of the University of St Andrews]]. The [[University of Glasgow]] has one from the same period, which may be seen in its [[coat of arms|arms]]. [[University of Innsbruck#Ceremonial Equipment|University of Innsbruck]] and its sister [[Innsbruck Medical University#Ceremonial equipment|Medical University]] are in possession of maces from 1572, 1588 and 1833, which were confiscated by the Habsburgs from the [[University of Olomouc]] in the 1850s.&lt;ref name="maces"&gt;{{cite journal

The latter was altered during the [[Cromwellian Commonwealth]] and again at the [[Stuart Restoration]]. The mace of the general council of the [[University of Edinburgh]] has a threesided head: one with the seal of the University; one with the university's coat of arms and the third with Edinburgh's coat of arms of the City of Edinburgh. The wood for the shaft of the mace is from [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and was presented by the [[Secretary of State for India]] ([[R. A. Cross, 1st Viscount Cross|R. A. Cross]]) at the [[First International Forestry Exhibition]] (1884).&lt;ref name="maceUoE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.general-council.ed.ac.uk/mace.htm|title=The General Council of the University of Edinburgh|accessdate=10 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619110926/http://www.general-council.ed.ac.uk/mace.htm|archivedate=19 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mace of the [[Open University]] reflects its modernist outlook, being made from titanium.&lt;ref name="openmace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reflectionandrefraction.co.uk/oumace.html|publisher=The Art of Reflection and Refraction|title=The Open University Mace|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, almost all universities and free-standing colleges have a mace, used almost exclusively at [[Graduation|commencement]] exercises and borne variously by the university or college [[University president|president]], [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]], [[Rector (academia)|rector]], [[Provost (education)|provost]], the [[marshal]] of the faculty, a [[Dean (education)|dean]] or some other high official. In those universities that have a number of constituent colleges or faculties, each college, faculty or school often has a smaller mace, borne in procession by a dean, faculty member or sometimes a privileged student. In 1970, Cornell professor [[Morris Bishop]] was acting as marshal at a graduation ceremony when a radical student attempted to grab the microphone; Bishop fought him off with the mace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper

In Canada, some universities have a mace that is used as part of the ceremonial process of conferring degrees during [[convocation]] and other special events. The mace is carried by a special university official like a [[beadle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nipissingu.ca/about-us/convocation/spring/Pages/Convocation-Ceremony.aspx#mace|publisher=Nipissing University| title=Convocation ceremony|archivedate=7 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307033931/http://www.nipissingu.ca/about-us/convocation/spring/Pages/Convocation-Ceremony.aspx#mace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines, the [[University of Santo Tomas]] has a pair of [[Maces of the Rector Magnificus of the University of Santo Tomas|twin maces]] belonging to the [[Rector Magnificus of the University of Santo Tomas|Rector Magnificus]]. These symbolize his spiritual and temporal power as the highest authority of the university. Made of pure silver and measuring 95 centimeters by 15 centimeters in diameter, the maces have existed since the 17th century and have been used in academic processions ever since. Candidates for doctoral degrees were accompanied by the Rector in a parade called ''Paseo de los Doctores'' from Intramuros to Santo Domingo Church, where University commencement exercises were held until the 17th century. Today, faculty members hold processions at the opening of each academic year and during solemn investitures in academic gowns, following the style of Spanish academic regalia. The maces, carried by beadles or macebearers, were included in the parade for their academic symbolism.&lt;ref name=ustmaces&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varsitarian.net/special_reports/20120618/rectors_regalia_heighten_pomp_and_pageantry|title=Rector's regalia heighten pomp and pageantry|publisher=The Varsitarian|accessdate=17 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120802065509/http://www.varsitarian.net/special_reports/20120618/rectors_regalia_heighten_pomp_and_pageantry#|archive-date=2012-08-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other maces==
*The mace of the [[Cork (city)|Cork]] [[guild]]s, made by Robert Goble of Cork in 1696 for the associated guilds of which he had been master, is in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. The museum also has a large silver mace dating to the middle of the 18th century, with the arms of [[Pope Benedict XIV]]. This mace is said to have been used at the coronation of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] as king of [[Italy]] at [[Milan]] in 1805.

By 1917 the rising price of milk lead to much reduced consumption (25% that year alone) causing concerns about child welfare.  The CMC set the price to 13 cents per quart, for home delivery, a cent less than the prevailing price.&lt;ref name="Pegram 1992"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Thomas R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3523">The '''Conference of the Three Internationals''' took place in [[Berlin]] between 2–6 April 1922. The three internationals were the [[Berne International]], the [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties]] (also known as the Vienna International or the 2½ International) and the [[Communist International]] or 3rd International.

==Background==
The Vienna International had been founded on February 27, 1921, uniting left-wing [[social democratic]] parties. Friedrich Adler of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SPÖ) was appointed secretary, something which reinforced the influence of [[Austromarxism]] amongst the adherents.&lt;ref name="Wandycz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wandycz|first1=Piotr Stefan|title=Ideology, Politics, and Diplomacy in East Central Europe|date=2003|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=9781580461375|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fhK5QebocBkC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=%22Vienna+Union%22+Austromarxism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=apmk8luclG&amp;sig=EOodDgWvf87OsEayiIE1Wb3-NUc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-zOCY2LbYAhXDAcAKHZmfCYIQ6AEINzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Vienna%20Union%22%20Austromarxism&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berne International agreed to attend on condition that three issues were added to the agenda: [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], socialist prisoners in Russia and the role of Communist cells in the social democratic trade unions.&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jansen|first1=M.|title=A Show Trial Under Lenin: The Trial of the Socialist Revolutionaries, Moscow 1922|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400976061|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mPznCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Georgia+%22conference+of+the+Three+Internationals%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yXFGl__Gc-&amp;sig=M3HKvCabJnEVrbccLHltFsdqx5k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl-ZPf8d_YAhWDDcAKHTxcAA4Q6AEINjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Georgia%20%22conference%20of%20the%20Three%20Internationals%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corruption in Portugal''' is examined on this page.

== Extent ==
[[Transparency International]]’s Global Corruption Barometer 2013 reveals that [[Political parties in Portugal|political parties]], [[Parliament of Portugal|Parliament]], the judiciary and the [[Portuguese military|military]] are the most corrupt institutions in [[Portugal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Corruption Barometer 2013|url=http://www.transparency.org/gcb2013|publisher=Transparency International’s|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 29th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exposure of high-profile corruption cases in the media and the limited political engagement have contributed to poor public perception of political corruption in Portugal. Recurring corruption scandals involving high-level politicians, local administrators and businesses abusing public funds have revealed that safeguards to counter corruption and abuse of power have been relatively inefficient, according to the National Integrity System Assessment 2012 by the Portuguese chapter of Transparency International (TIAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the National Integrity System Assessment 2012|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/media/3923478/2011_NISPortugal_PT.pdf|publisher=The Portuguese chapter of Transparency International (TIAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snapshot of the Portugal Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/portugal/snapshot.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding business and corruption, several sources indicate that corruption plays a limited role in Portugal's business culture. Foreign companies reportedly encounter limited corruption, but they do not consider corruption an obstacle for foreign direct investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Investment Climate Statement - Portugal|url=https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2013/204717.htm|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Index of Economic Freedom- Portugal|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/country/portugal|publisher=Heritage Foundation|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to financing and inefficient government bureaucracy are considered the most problematic factors for doing business, according to the surveyed business executives from World Economic Forum [[Global Competitiveness Report]] 2013-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014|url=http://www.weforum.org/|publisher=World Economic Forum|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU report on corruption, revealed that the Portuguese perceive the a high level of corruption (with 90% answering that corruption is widespread, compared to an EU average of 76%). However, the same report reveals that, when asked if they had actually witness corruption, only 1% responded positively (with an EU average of 5%).&lt;ref&gt;EU Anti-Corruption Report – Portugal country sheet, http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/organized-crime-and-human-trafficking/corruption/anti-corruption-report/docs/2014_acr_portugal_factsheet_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Crusader Kings II: Sword of Islam''''' is a [[downloadable content]] pack developed by [[Paradox Development Studio]] and published by [[Paradox Interactive]] for the [[grand strategy wargame]] ''[[Crusader Kings II]]''. It allows the player to play as Muslim characters within the main game for the first time, and introduces a number of events and gameplay elements for those characters, such as [[decadence]] and [[polygamy]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Mosquée Masjid el Haram à la Mecque.jpg|thumb|right|The expansion introduces the Hajj, in which the player can conduct the Tawaf around the Kaaba ''(pictured)''.]]
In the [[Crusader Kings II|original game]], the player can play as any Christian dynasty. ''Sword of Islam'' expands that premise, to allow the gamer to play as any of the Islamic characters in the game, and introduces new events and actions only available to the characters of those related religions. The graphical interface was re-designed for use when playing an Islamic character. The new actions include celebrating [[Ramadan]] and sending their player-character on a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]], known as the [[Hajj]]. The level of detail given in that action includes allowing the player to decide whether the character to proudly or humbly chant while walking around the [[Kaaba]] during the [[Tawaf]].&lt;ref name=wargamer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tanaleon|first1=James|title=Crusader Kings II: Sword of Islam|url=http://www.wargamer.com/Article/3216|publisher=[[Wargamer.com]]|date=July 27, 2012|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion introduced a new gameplay attribute for Islamic characters, known as decadence. It was intended to show stagnation in a dynasty, leading to lower troop morale and tax income from their held lands. The decadence levels are generated by the number of males who do not hold titles within the family, and can build up over time. This adds a level of family management to the game, as the player can choose whether to give them territory or attempt to have them killed in order to remove the increasing levels of decadence.&lt;ref name=wargamer/&gt; Further to the family management side of the game, the expansion also introduced the ability to have multiple wives for the first time, but is only allowed for Islamic religions.&lt;ref name=wargamer/&gt; Should the character not have sufficient wives to match the level of their station, then it will impact on their prestige.&lt;ref name=destinter&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Frasier|title=Interview: Harems and sand in Crusader Kings II|url=http://www.destructoid.com/interview-harems-and-sand-in-crusader-kings-ii-229991.phtml|publisher=[[Destructoid]]|date=June 23, 2012|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-Islamic related change in ''Sword of Islam'' was an update to the way in which the game approaches assassinations and plots. Whereas in the original game, it would display a percentage chance of having a character killed by the action, the updated mechanic has characters work together on those assassinations over time. For example, another character might suggest killing someone by using [[fertilizer]] as the basis for an explosive.&lt;ref name=wargamer/&gt;

==Development and release==
''Sword of Islam'' was the first major expansion to ''Crusader Kings II''.&lt;ref name=destinter/&gt; It was first announced in May 2012, to be released later that year in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Derocher|first1=Joshua|title=Defend the Holy Land from the Crusaders in Sword of Islam|url=http://www.destructoid.com/defend-the-holy-land-from-the-crusaders-in-sword-of-islam-228319.phtml|publisher=[[Destructoid]]|date=May 30, 2012|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hatfield|first1=Tom|title=Crusader Kings 2 Sword of Islam expansion announced, will let you side with Saladin|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/crusader-kings-2-sword-of-islam-expansion-announced-will-let-you-side-with-saladin/|accessdate=March 8, 2015|work=PC Gamer|date=May 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to allow players to play as [[Muslim]] characters and rulers, but also to introduce a new style of gameplay for those types of characters. The lead on the project, Henrik Fåhraeus, said that the decadence system was the hardest part of the expansion to balance correctly, but also the part that he felt proudest of.&lt;ref name=destinter/&gt;

==Reception==
''Crusader Kings II: Sword of Islam'' was released as [[downloadable content]] on June 26, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crusader Kings II: Sword of Islam|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/crusader-kings-ii-sword-of-islam|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of ''Sword of Islam'' coincided with a patch which changed some elements of the main game. These included an introduction of minor and major claims on land for characters, and a map extension, going further south west into Africa to add [[Mali]] and [[Ghana]]. Additional de jure empires were also introduced, such as a united British Isles forming the Britannia Empire and a united Scandinavian region forming the Empire of the same name.&lt;ref name=destinter/&gt;

In a preview piece for [[Kotaku]], Luke Plunkett described the idea behind ''Sword of Islam'' as "awesome" due to the normal lack of opportunity to play realistic Islamic or Middle Eastern characters in video games whilst dismissing the "fairy-tale" and "cliched ideal" of ''[[Prince of Persia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Plunkett|first1=Luke|title=Play a Game as a Medieval Islamic Ruler. For Once.|url=http://kotaku.com/5914463/play-a-game-as-a-medieval-islamic-ruler-for-once|publisher=Kotaku|date=May 31, 2012|accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Tanaleon reviewed the expansion for [[Wargamer.com]], and called it a "excellent and a much needed expansion".&lt;ref name=wargamer /&gt; He added that it was a waste not to have Muslim characters playable in the original game, and that the expansion was a "positive step forward" for [[Paradox Interactive]].&lt;ref name=wargamer /&gt;

'''The Defence Reform Act 2014''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].  It has 51 sections and seven schedules, and is concerned with [[defence procurement]] and the UK [[Reserve Forces]], particularly the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]].

==Long title==
The long title of an Act (see the infobox opposite) is of significance because it forms part of the Act, and is the 'first of the elements of an Act ... that can be used to find the meaning of the Act, and generally its scope.' in future legal decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| author1     = Gifford, D J
| author2     = Salter, John
| ISBN        = 1-85941-206-8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Territorial extent==
The Bill extends to the whole of the United Kingdom. Amendments to, and repeals of, other legislation made by Part 3 have the same extent as the provisions amended or repealed. Amendments made by this Act to the [[Reserve Forces Act 1980]], the [[Reserve Forces Act 1996]] and the [[Armed Forces Act 2006]] can be extended to the [[Channel Islands]] and/or the [[Isle of Man]] by provisions that already exist in those Acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|accessdate    =17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Queen's Speech]] on the opening of the 2013-14 session of Parliament included a reference to 'Measures...to improve the way this country procures defence equipment, as well as strengthening the Reserve Forces.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-queens-speech-2013|title=The Queen’s Speech 2013|last=|first=|date=8 May 2014|website=|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the background note to the speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url        =https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/197434/Queens-Speech-2013.pdf
|publisher  =HM Government
|accessdate =17 May 2014
|title      =The Queen’s Speech 2013 - briefing notes
|date       =8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Government said &lt;blockquote&gt;The Bill would enable the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MoD) to fundamentally change the way it procures and supports defence equipment by reforming the Defence Equipment and Support (DE&amp;S) organisation and strengthening the arrangements for single source (non-competitive) procurement.  The Bill would increase the size and role of our Reserve Forces.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Policy contents==

===Procurement===

A [[White Paper]], "Better Defence Acquisition" covering the procurement provisions referred to in the speech was published in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url           =https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/206032/20130610_WP_Better_Def_Acquisition_screen_final.pdf
|title         =Better Defence Acquisition
|date          =7 June 2013
|accessdate    =17 May 2014
|publisher     =UK Ministry of Defence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 1 of the paper addresses procurement carried out by the MOD's 'Defence Equipment and Support' (DE&amp;S)function, and identifies three long standing significant problems ("Root causes") within procurement which the Government believes has contributed to poor performance:

*An overheated equipment programme,&lt;ref&gt;Better Defence Acquisition, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;  resulting in constant changes to the MOD's procurement schedule, and resultant cost increases and delays;
*An unstable interface between the requester and deliverer,&lt;ref&gt;Better Defence Acquisition, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that division of responsibility between DE&amp;S and the ultimate customers for the equipment was not always clear, and;
*Insufficient Skills and management freedoms within DE&amp;S,&lt;ref&gt;Better Defence Acquisition, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in DE&amp;S being unable to recruit and retain personnel who were able to consistently negotiate on equal terms with industry.

The paper argued that the first two of these problems had been solved, by balancing the MOD's overall budget, but that if the overheated equipment programme was not to return, fundamental change would be required. The paper suggested two solutions. The first, preferred, proposal,&lt;ref&gt;Better Defence Acquisition, p.15&lt;/ref&gt; would be the establishment of a 'Government-Owned, Contractor Operated' (GOCO) model for defence procurement, whereby a private sector consortium would effectively act as the MOD's procurement agent - requirements would still be specified and decided upon by the Department, but the procurement itself would be managed and delivered by the private sector.  The second option, "DE&amp;S Plus" (consisting of negotiating with [[Her Majesty's Treasury|the Treasury]] for increased management freedom for DE&amp;S but keeping its staff in the public sector, was discussed, but only in terms of 'the public sector benchmark against which the GOCO option will ultimately be judged', rather than a proposal given equal weighting with the GOCO option.&lt;ref&gt;Better Defence Acquisition, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

The second chapter of the paper addressed 'single source procurement' - that is, 'procurement of equipmentand support...where the MOD is unable to source its requirements through open competition'.&lt;ref&gt;Better Defence Acquisition, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal, which closely follows the recommendations of a report by [[David Currie, Baron Currie of Marylebone|Lord Currie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

which was published in 2011) was to create what would effectively be a regulatory body called the '[[Single Source Regulations Office]]', (SSRO) to manage single-source procurement. The SSRO would replace the existing regulator, the 'Review Board for Government Contracts'.&lt;ref&gt;Better Defence Acquisition, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EasyTrade''' (NemHandel in Danish) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] e-invoicing infrastructure, developed by the [[National IT and Telecom Agency]] and launched in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/document/nemhandel-open-infrastructure-e-business-nemhandel-easytrade "NemHandel - Open Infrastructure for E-Business (NemHandel (EasyTrade)"]&lt;/ref&gt; EasyTrade is based on open standards (including the [[Universal Business Language]], Reliable Asynchronous Secure Profile (RASP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RASP|publisher=[[National IT and Telecom Agency]]|url=http://digitaliser.dk/resource/391706}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UDDI]]), open source components, and digital certificates. It was launched as part of a Danish Government Globalisation initiative in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government Strategy for Denmark in the Global Economy|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)]]|url=http://www.netpublikationer.dk/um/6648/html/chapter01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the auspices of Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]].

The public sector in Denmark receives more than 15 million electronic invoices every year from approximately 150,000 suppliers. Non-electronic invoices for a public sector institution will be rejected. There are more than 30,000 public sector e-invoicing end points. An end point can be everything from a municipality to a kindergarten or even a department within a public sector institution. End points are addressed via [[Global Location Number]]s or via Company Registration Numbers (called CVR-numbers in Denmark).

==History==
Easytrade was mandated by law in February 2005. The initial version was based on traditional [[Electronic data interchange]] (EDI) methods in combination with an early version of [[Universal Business Language]].
The current version of Easytrade was launched in 2007 and is based on modern internet technologies.

==Architecture==
Easytrade is an example of the 4-Corner Model for interoperability between service providers. This model is best known from the telephony industry where Telco-operators interoperate by roaming traffic between each other. The advantage of this model is that any party in a transaction can switch provider seamlessly without having to notify the other parties with whom they exchange business documents.

'''Emancipation''' is any effort to procure [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic and social rights]], [[civil and political rights|political rights]] or [[Egalitarianism|equality]], often for a specifically [[disenfranchised]] group, or more generally, in discussion of such matters. Emancipation stems from ''[[wikt:en:ex#Latin|ēx]] [[wikt:en:manus#Latin|manus]] [[wikt:en:capio#Latin|capere]]'' ('detach from the hand').
Among others, [[Karl Marx]] discussed political emancipation in his 1844 essay "[[On the Jewish Question]]", although often in addition to (or in contrast with) the term ''human emancipation''. Marx's views of political emancipation in this work were summarized by one writer as entailing "equal status of individual citizens in relation to the state, [[equality before the law]], regardless of religion, property, or other 'private' characteristics of individual people."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090322060613/http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/merupert/political_and_human_emancipation.htm Notes on Political and Human Emancipation], Mark Rupert, Syracuse University.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Political emancipation" as a [[phrase]] is less common in modern usage, especially outside academic, foreign or activist contexts.  However, similar concepts may be referred to by other terms. For instance, in the United States the [[Civil Rights Movement]] culminated in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], and the [[Fair Housing Act|Fair Housing Act of 1968]] can be seen as further realization of events such as the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and abolition of slavery a century earlier. In the current and former [[British West Indies]] islands the holiday [[Emancipation Day]] is celebrated to mark the end of the [[Atlantic slave trade]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4773">'''Emgann''' is a left wing [[Breton nationalism|Breton nationalist]] movement in [[Brittany]], [[France]]. Founded in 1982, it soon became one of the principal groups agitating for Breton independence. They describe themselves as a "Left wing independentist movement" which "fights for the emancipation and the national liberation of the Breton people and their direct representation in European authorities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chez.com/emgann/lang/anglais.htm Emgann - Breton Independence Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Emgann emerges from the [[History of Breton nationalism|third Emsav]], the revival of Breton nationalism as a leftist movement after the 1960s. It describes itself as [[anti-capitalist]] and [[anti-racist]] movement. It was formed in 1983 by radical militants within the Breton independence movement after the sudden shift in French politics caused by the 1981 election of a leftist government. Shortly after it was elected, the [[François Mitterrand|Mitterrand]] government granted an amnesty to the nineteen Breton militants still in prison at the time, removing one of the political demands of Breton nationalists. Between their release and the establishment of a left wing government in [[Paris]], leftist nationalism began to dwindle in Brittany, and Emgann was established in large part in response to this change in the political climate.

Emgann's 1988 manifesto also emphasises the importance of solidarity with other national liberation movements, citing [[Basque people|Basque]] nationalists as an example.

One of Emgann's particularities is its refusal of all contact with established French political parties, and its atypical pattern of recruitment.  At the end of the 1990s, it was largely absent from the universities - the traditional recruiting ground of French radical political movements - but instead tended to recruit new members in urban areas, especially among the young unemployed and under-employed.  As a result, the movement's militancy tends to be proportionate to the weakness of the local economy.

In 1995, Emgann organised a celebration of the Breton nation called ''Devezh Ar Vro''. The movement also publishes a journal called ''Combat Breton'', currently edited by [[Yann Puillandre]].

== Connection with the Breton Revolutionary Army==

Emgann's leaders are adamant that ''"Emgann is not the legal mouthpeice of the ARB"'' (''[[Armée Révolutionnaire Bretonne]]'' - Breton Revolutionary Army).  The ARB is the armed branch of the ''[[Front de Libération de la Bretagne]]'' (''Breton Liberation Front'') - a banned organisation that French law considers to be a terrorist group.  Despite Emgann's denials of any formal link between the two organisations, its official statements call the ARB a "patriotic resistance organisation" and their journal ''Combat Breton'' publishes the ARB's press releases. 

Emgann clams that it does not approve of the violent actions of the ARB, but it doesn't disapprove either, treating them instead as "a logical consequence of the colonialist French state and the desperation of young Bretons."  However, several members of Emgann were arrested and convicted by French courts as accomplices in the theft of several tonnes of explosives from a Breton company in [[Plévin]] ([[Côtes-d'Armor]]) in 1999.  This theft was followed by a series of bombings attributed to the ARB, including a fatal explosion at a [[McDonald's]] in [[Quévert]] (Côtes-d'Armor).  Ultimately, a former spokesman for Emgann was cleared of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts for the bombings in Quévert and elsewhere.  However, since many of the accused were held in [[Remand (detention)|provisional detention]] for several years before their trials, many were released, having been imprisoned for longer than the time they were sentenced to before their trials even started.  One has appealed his conviction to the [[European Court of Human Rights]].  These lengthy delays and other claimed irregularities in the trial have led to their condemnation by Emgann as a ''"travesty"''.

== Aims ==

* The reunification of [[Loire-Atlantique]] with Brittany.
* The official recognition of the Breton people and the [[Breton language]].
* The freeing of Breton [[political prisoner]]s

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2972">'''Gianfranco Sanguinetti''' (born July 16, 1948, [[Pully]], [[Switzerland]]), was a writer and member of the [[Situationist International]] (SI), a political art movement. He is [[Teresa Mattei]]'s son.

== Biography ==
Sanguinetti was deported from [[France]] in 1971 and settled in [[Italy]].

By 1972, Sanguinetti and [[Guy Debord]] were the only two remaining members of the SI. Together they wrote "The Veritable Split In The International" a book detailing the rise and fall of the SI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://netartreview.net/weeklyFeatures/2005_05_22_archive.html NAR Features&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Again working with Debord, in August 1975, Sanguinetti wrote a pamphlet titled ''Rapporto veridico sulle ultima opportunita di salvare il capitalismo in Italia'' ([[English language|Eng]]: ''The Real Report on the Last Chance to Save Capitalism in Italy''), which (inspired by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Bruno Bauer]]) purported to be the cynical writing of "Censor", a powerful [[industrialist]]. The pamphlet was to show how the ruling class of Italy supported the  [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] and other covert, [[false flag]] mass slaughter, for the higher goal of defending the capitalist status quo from the communist claims. The pamphlet was mailed to 520 of Italy's most powerful individuals.

===Modus of scam===
While posted at Fatehbad, the Forests officer [[Sanjiv Chaturvedi]] accused the Congress [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] Prahlad Singh Gillakhera of corruption in a herbal park establishment project. He alleged that Gillakhera's relatives were buying rare trees for their personal gardens with the taxpayers' money.&lt;ref name="Tehelka_Good"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main48.asp?filename=Ne260211Coverstory_3.asp |title=No Sanctuary for Good Men |journal=Tehelka |date=26 February 2011 |issue=8 |volume=8 |author=Yamini Deenadayalan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rediff_punished_2012"&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/special/in-haryana-you-are-punished-if-you-fight-corruption/20120629.htm In Haryana, you are punished if you fight corruption!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rediff_punished_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IT_hounded"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/A+clean+slate+for+hounded+officer.-a0248366559 A clean slate for hounded officer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his suspension, the Haryana Forest Department had started prosecution against the contractors, based on earlier reports filed by him. However, after the [[non-governmental organization|NGO]] [[Ekta Parishad]] moved against the accused in the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] in April 2008, the Hooda Government protected the violators.&lt;ref name="Outlook_old"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/Old-Jungle-Saying/281836 |title=Old Jungle Saying |author=Chander Suta Dogra |date=13 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rediff_punished_2012"/&gt;

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Green Party logo.svg|right|350px]] --&gt;
'''The Green Party of Canada''' was founded at a conference held at Carleton University in Ottawa in 1983. Under its first leader, Dr. [[Trevor Hancock]], the party ran 60 candidates in the [[1984 Canadian federal election]].&lt;ref name="greenparty.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://greenparty.ca/en/party/history|title=History|work=greenparty.ca|date=30 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707110724/http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/parties_leaders/clips/17081/ "The Green Party sprouts."] [http://archives.cbc.ca/ CBC News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406002327/http://archives.cbc.ca/ |date=6 April 2012 }}. Accessed September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Green Party of British Columbia|BC Greens]] ran Canada's first Green candidate. Later that year, the founding conference of the [[Green Party of Canada|Canadian Greens]] was held at [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa]], Ontario.&lt;ref name="greenparty.ca"/&gt; Close to 200 people from 55 communities attended, coming from every province except [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] and [[Prince Edward Island]].

The birthing process was difficult, with deep divisions between those arguing for a national structure, and those in favour of a process that would build from the regions following the [[bioregional democracy]] structure.

[[Trevor Hancock]] was the party's first registered leader. Party members chose a radically decentralized party structure, and for several years a kind of [[green anarchism]] prevailed. Eventually, an uneasy agreement was reached for a federation of regional parties, with strong support for building upwards from the bottom. The question arose: "Is the priority to redefine politics from the ground up, or to play the electoral game according to the present rules? Or both?"

Many members saw the party as a way to protest Canada's political system, and not much more. Nonetheless it did run candidates.

==1980s==
The [[Green Party of Canada]] was registered in 1983 by Paul George, Ted Mousseau, William Marshall, Ed McDonough and Seymour Trieger in June - just preceding a byelection in Mission-Port Moody during which Betty Nickerson ran as a Green Party of Canada candidate. The party had not gained official status at that point so the party name did not appear on the ballot - though it did on all her communications. The first convention in Ontario later that fall elected the next set of party officers. The [[Green Party of Canada]] contested its first [[Canadian federal election, 1984|federal election in September 1984]]. Approximately 27,000 Canadians voted Green (0.2% of the votes cast). But ongoing discussions about the party's ''modus operandi'' became so exhausting that, at one point in the mid-1980s, there was a near collapse of the party. It survived — though not particularly active — for almost a decade under the stewardship of the BC Greens.

In the [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988 federal election]], Greens concentrated on [[Quebec]], where ''le Parti Vert'' (not the same as the current [[Parti Vert du Québec]]) ran 29 candidates, up from just 4 in the previous election. ''Les Verts'' received higher results than Green candidates anywhere else in Canada, polling an average of 2.4% of the vote. The Quebec wing hosted the 1990 Canadian Greens conference in Montreal. But soon after that, Canada's constitutional problems interfered, and many Quebec candidates abandoned the Greens in favour of a [[Quebec sovereignty|Quebec sovereigntist]] party, the [[Bloc Québécois]]. There were only six Green candidates from Quebec in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 election]].

In the summer of 1988, the BC Greens, under the ''de facto'' leadership of electoral-reform activist [[Steve Kisby]], tried to get the Green Party of Canada onto its feet by hosting a conference — the first federal gathering since the founding meeting in 1983. The main accomplishment of that conference was the acceptance, after five years as a registered party, of a constitution. The party continued to field candidates at the federal level, and provincial parties were organized in a few other provinces, led by consistently strong efforts in British Columbia.

In 1988, however, despite minimal on-the-ground organization, Quebec produced the lion's share of Green candidates and votes thanks to the efforts of Quebec organizer and candidate Rolf Bramann. A year later, the provincial Greens in Quebec scored 2% of the popular vote, averaging 5% in the constituencies in which they ran under the leadership of [[Jean Ouimet]]. Montreal's municipal Ecology Party also scored very well in elections in this period under the leadership of publisher [[Dimitrios Roussopoulos]].

Ouimet, a strong sovereigntist, maintained a party wholly independent of the federal Greens during his leadership; as a result Bramann created an organization called the Green Party of Canada in Quebec, a predominantly Anglophone entity that nominated federal candidates only. There was open antipathy between Ouimet and Bramann. Neither was affiliated with Écologie-Montreal.

At the same time as the Parti Vert began to collapse due to Ouimet's defection to the PQ in 1992, Bramann was removed from his position in the federal party due to anti-Semitic comments he and some of his candidates had made. This led to a precipitous decline in all Green Party organizations in Quebec despite a very promising start a mere four years previous.

From 1988 onwards, a pattern developed whereby the federal party tended to function alternately as an appendage of the BC and Ontario provincial parties. Lacking sufficient funding and an administrative base of its own, control of the federal Greens was sometimes a prize (when the provincial affiliate and its leader wanted to demonstrate its success), and at others, a burden (when the provincial affiliate was forced to invest significant volunteer energy or money for its maintenance) for the Greens in BC and Ontario. Successful candidates for the positions of Leader and Chief Financial Officer were typically personal associates of either the BC or Ontario party's ''de facto'' or ''de jure'' leader, for whom the leader publicly mobilized and delivered votes.

==1990s==
In the spring of 1996, although the hopes of electing a representative to the BC legislature proved premature, Andy Shadrack in the interior of the province received over 11% of the vote. Overall, the party's proportion of the popular vote surged to a new high. Shadrack was also the most popular Green candidate in the 1997 federal election, scoring over 6% of the popular vote in West Kootenay-Okanagan.

At the party's sixth annual gathering in [[Castlegar, British Columbia]], hosted by Shadrack's riding association, in August 1996, a complete overhaul of the party's constitution was made, spearheaded by [[Stuart Parker (politician)|Stuart Parker]], leader of the provincial Greens in BC. The party's new constitutional framework both democratized and centralized the party which had been previously hobbled by an unworkably decentralized structure. These changes also ended de jure (it had ended de facto some three years earlier) the constitutional prohibition against the party's registered leader acting as its spokesperson or representative. Policy was also agreed to in a wide variety of areas. An important step forward was the structuring of a [[Shadow Cabinet]], whose mandate was to create a platform for the [[Canadian federal election, 1997|next election in 1997]].

The Castlegar gathering marked the beginning of a new era in Canadian Green history, and a somewhat uneasy one at that. In spite of a concern about the nature of leadership in a decentralized party, the Greens' first leadership campaign had been underway for the previous six months. Four candidates contested the leadership. A mail-in ballot was held: [[Wendy Priesnitz]] (from Ontario) beat Don Francis (Quebec), Jason Crummey ([[Newfoundland and Labrador]]), and Harry Garfinkle ([[Alberta]]) to become the Registered Leader of the Green Party of Canada.

In January 1997, although initially recruited by [[Green Party of Ontario|Ontario Green Party]] leader [[Frank de Jong]], Wendy Priesnitz resigned over what she characterized as domination of the party by an "old boys' network" comprising the BC and Ontario provincial leaders and their male-dominated circles of organizers and advisors. Harry Garfinkle stepped in to be the interim Registered Leader of the Green Party of Canada, and a leadership convention by mail-in ballot was held.

==Joan Russow==
British Columbia's [[Joan Russow]] became leader of the Green Party of Canada on April 13, 1997. Russow won 52% of the ballots cast in the 1997 leadership race, surpassing Ontario's Jim Harris (39%) and Rachelle Small (8%). Immediately upon attaining the leadership, Russow was plunged into a federal general election. Russow's campaign in 1997 set a number of important precedents. The 1997 election was the first campaign in which the Greens conducted a national leader's tour, presented a national platform and a bilingual campaign (Russow is trilingual, speaking Spanish, French and English). Previous campaigns, due in part to the party's few resources and, in part, to the party's constitutional straitjacket, had been characterized by policy and spokespeople operating, at best, province-by-province and, at worst, riding-by-riding. In her own riding of Victoria, Russow received just shy of 3000 votes and 6% of the popular vote.

In the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 election]], the party nominated 111 candidates, in nine out of ten provinces — all but Newfoundland and Labrador — and in one of three territories ([[Nunavut]]). These candidates collected 0.81% of the total popular vote.

Candidates were not run in Newfoundland and Labrador, as a result of ongoing divisions over Joan Russow's refusal to endorse the Green candidate in an earlier St. John's West [[by-election]]. (The candidate in question supported the seal hunt and mining development, as most locals did.) This caused much uncertainty and friction between Newfoundland's Terra Nova Green Party Association and the Green Party leader as the party gradually adapted to the realities of functioning as a true national party rather than a disorganized federation of local activists.

In the 2001 [[Quebec City protest]] against the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]], Russow was the first person incarcerated in a jail built specially for protesters, for taking a photograph of it from outside. Russow promoted the Green Party as a leader in the [[anti-globalization movement]], in particular the anti-[[corporatist]] and pro-peace movement, but felt undermined when the [[German Greens]] supported the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|bombing of Belgrade]]. As other members of her party had supported military intervention, Russow's leadership was called into question. She stepped down as party leader in 2001 and left the party to join the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (NDP). Because the NDP's federal and provincial wings are integrated, this also entailed joining the [[New Democratic Party of British Columbia]].

Another factor in her resignation may have been ongoing conflicts within the party provincially and municipally in her home city of Victoria, where she had switched allegiance from the Parker faction to the [[Adriane Carr]] faction. Her late conversion left her on unsure footing with the powerful new provincial leader and in public conflict with City Councilor Art Vanden Berg and other members of the Parker-affiliated team that had backed her leadership during the 1997 and 1998 leadership contests.

The conflicts left Russow isolated and alienated from most members of the party. Volunteer efforts were substantially absorbed in provincial campaigns between 2001 and 2003, and the federal party became dormant between elections, as was typical in the past. [[Chris Bradshaw]] served the party as interim leader from 2001 to February 2003.

==Jim Harris==
[[File:Jim Harris Calgary 2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]], Former Green Party Leader in [[Calgary, Alberta]]]]

In February 2003, [[Jim Harris (politician)|Jim Harris]], in his second bid for the leadership, defeated John Grogan of [[Valemount, British Columbia]], and Jason Crummey. Crummey was originally from Newfoundland and involved with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] Terra Nova Greens. Harris, an author and public speaker, and GPC member since 1987 (though not active in several previous elections), had the support of all provincial Green Party leaders, breaking 15 years of precedent of the BC leader backing a BC candidate from their own political circle. His election was taken by many as reflecting a desire among the members to "become serious" in achieving electoral progress, and to steer away from any explicit anti-political ideas. However, his campaign also included a hard line against [[Red-green alliance|Red-Green]] (i.e., alliances with NDP members and [[labour movement|organized labour]]) coalitions that Russow had supported at the municipal level in Victoria. While adopting the rhetoric of pragmatism, some argue, Harris eschewed the only strategy that has ever elected Greens under the first-past-the-post system. Harris announced on April 24, 2006, that he would stand down as leader at the party's convention in August.

===Full slate===
The Green Party ran a fundraising campaign in 2003 to realize Harris' goal of running a full slate in the upcoming election. This party also had to borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars against the $1.75/vote expected to accrue to the party after the election. The party began organizing in all provinces with paid staff.

===2004 election and aftermath===
In the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 election]], the party received a significant increase in media coverage on the strength of its [[Green Party of Canada candidates, 2004 federal election|308 candidates]], the platform, and a national leaders' tour. The party began to be included in almost all national political polls. Its popular support peaked at 7% during the campaign, and the party finished with 4.3% of the vote. The party's strongest candidate, [[Andrew Lewis (politician)|Andrew Lewis]] in the riding of [[Saanich—Gulf Islands]], won over 10,000 votes, the first Green Party candidate to do so. Lewis still finished fourth in the riding, however.

In August 2004 at the national convention near Calgary, Alberta, Jim Harris was re-elected, with a reduced majority of only 56%. Rival Tom Manley polled nearly 37%.

Most conference debate centred on significant constitutional reform proposals, and the role of membership in ruling on matters of policy and the constitution. The conference ended with a re-affirmation of a hybrid that was developed during the campaign: a centralized executive with decentralized policy and constitutional development.

Politicians from different political backgrounds have expressed interest in the party. Former Deputy Prime Minister [[Sheila Copps]] on March 2, 2005, spoke publicly to a group of Greens in Toronto, advising the party on its electoral strategy. Former Progressive Conservative leadership candidate [[David Orchard]] not only attended but met with members of the GPC Council; however, Orchard's involvement with the Greens dates back to the mid-1990s when he worked with Russow on a variety of trade and international issues. (Ontario leader [[Frank de Jong]] and BC leader [[Stuart Parker (politician)|Stuart Parker]] were featured speakers at pro-Orchard rallies early in his first bid for the Tory leadership in 1998.) It was also rumoured in the media in 2004 that [[David Anderson (British Columbia politician)|David Anderson]], the former Minister of the Environment in Chrétien's government, was considering joining the party. Anderson, however, successfully ran for re-election as a Liberal.

===2006 election===
[[File:Green Party of Canada leadership convention, 2006.jpg|thumb|Green Party of Canada leadership convention, 2006]]

None of the party's candidates were elected, but the party received 4.5% of the vote nationally (up from 4.3% in 2004) and 665,940 votes (an increase of about 80,000 votes from 2004). Its best performance was in Alberta, where it received 6.6%. Sean Maw won 10.84% of the vote in [[Wild Rose (electoral district)|Wild Rose]] and finished a very distant second to Conservative [[Myron Thompson]]. [[Shane Jolley]] won 12.9% of the vote in [[Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound]] riding, the largest share of the vote won by any of its candidates. In the riding [[Ottawa Centre]], the Green candidate [[David Chernushenko]] received 6,766 votes, the largest number of votes of any of the party's candidates. It had been hoped by Greens that the party's deputy leader, Andrew Lewis, would achieve a breakthrough in [[Saanich—Gulf Islands]] where he won 16.7% of the vote in the 2004 election and carried 17 of 238 polling divisions, making Lewis the first Green candidate to win even one polling division. However, running again in Saanich—Gulf Islands in 2006 he lost one-third of his 2004 vote share, winning only 9.6% of the ballots cast.

The party's [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 election campaign]] was disrupted by allegations made by Matthew Pollesell, the party's former assistant national organizer, that Harris had not filed a proper accounting of money spent during his 2004 leadership campaign, as required by law. Pollesell issued a request that Elections Canada investigate. Pollesell and another former party member, Gretchen Schwarz, were subsequently warned by the party's legal counsel to retract allegations they had made or face a possible legal action. Dana Miller, who served in the party's shadow cabinet with responsibility for human-rights issues, made public her earlier complaints that the party has violated election law and its own constitution and has also asked for an Elections Canada investigation. Miller was expelled from the party after filing a complaint within the party in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20051229/ELXNGREENS29/TPNational/?query=%22jim+harris%22 | location=Toronto | title=globeandmail.com }} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elizabeth May==
[[Image:Elizabeth May.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Elizabeth May]], Green Party Leader since August 2006]]
Elizabeth May was elected leader of the Green Party of Canada in August 2006. She ran in the November 27, 2006 [[London North Centre]] by-election, finishing second with 26% of the votes. It was the Green Party's best-ever result in a federal election, easily eclipsing the previous mark of 16.7% achieved in  2004 in the B.C. riding of [[Saanich-Gulf Islands]].

===2008 election===
In the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|2008 general election]], the Green Party's vote was up again to 6.8% and 937,613 votes. On August 30, the former Liberal MP [[Blair Wilson]] announces he is joining the [[Green Party of Canada]], becoming the party's first MP and He was defeated in the 2008 federal election, which was called before he had a chance to officially sit in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] as a Green MP. The best showing was in Elizabeth May's riding of Central Nova where May captured 32.2% of the vote against Conservative cabinet minister Peter MacKay.  Part of the reason for May's strong showing is that she brokered a deal with Liberal leader Stéphane Dion in which he agreed not to run a Liberal candidate.  In return, May agreed not to run a candidate in Dion's riding.

===2011 election===
Both for the first time, the leader [[Elizabeth May]] became the first [[Member of Parliament#Canada|Member]] of [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] elected to represent the party. She defeated Conservative Incumbent and cabinet minister [[Gary Lunn]].&lt;ref name="StarResultsPostElection"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Lesley Ciarula|title=Dryden falls, Trudeau survives: Notable election winners and losers|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/federalbudget/article/984605--dryden-falls-trudeau-survives-notable-election-winners-and-losers?bn=1|accessdate=3 May 2011|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Interim Government of Iran''' ({{lang-fa|دولت موقت ايران|Dowlat-e Movaghat-e Irân}}) was the first government established in [[Iran]] after the [[Iranian Revolution]], and the first nominal [[republic]] established in Iran after [[Iranian Empire|2,500 years of Persian monarchy]].

From 4 February to 11 February, Bazargan and [[Shapour Bakhtiar]], the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]]'s last Prime Minister, both claimed to be the legitimate prime minister; Bakhtiar fled on 11 February.&lt;ref name="Bazargan Becomes Prime Minister"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fouman.com/Y/Get_Iranian_History_Today.php?artid=238 | title=February, 5, 1979 A.D.: Bazargan Becomes Prime Minister | publisher=The Iranian history article | accessdate=17 July 2016 | author=Mir M.Hosseini}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehdi Bazargan was the prime minister of the interim government and introduced a seven-member cabinet on 14 February 1979.

The [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran|constitution]] of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] was adopted by referendum on 24 October 1979. Before it could come into force on 3 December 1979, however, the government resigned on 6 November soon after the [[Iran hostage crisis|taking over of the American embassy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nikou|first=Semira N.|title=Timeline of Iran's Political Events|url=http://iranprimer.usip.org/resource/timeline-irans-political-events|work=United States Institution of Peace|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; an act the government opposed but revolutionary leader Khomeini supported. The [[Council of the Islamic Revolution]] then served as the country's government until the formation of the first [[Islamic Consultative Assembly]] on 12 August 1980. Bazargan was elected to the first [[Islamic Consultative Assembly]] representing [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name="bazargan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bazargan.info/la_english/english.htm | title=Mehdi Bazargan's Biography | publisher=Cultural Foundation of Mehdi Bazargan | accessdate=16 July 2016 | author=Mehdi Noorbaksh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of the interim government==
When Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of the Iranian revolution, came back to Iran after his 15-year exile, he appointed Mehdi Bazargan as the head of the interim government.&lt;ref name="The Revolutionary Guards in Iranian Politics"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kp3wCQAAQBAJ&amp;dq=The+formation+of+Interim+government+of+iran+bazargan&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=The Revolutionary Guards in Iranian Politics: Elites and Shifting Relations | publisher=Routledge | author=Bayram Sinkaya | pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 February 1979, Ruhollah Khomeini issued a decree appointing Bazargan as the prime minister of "The Provisional Islamic Revolutionary Government".

His decree stated:

{{quote|Based on the proposal of the [[Iranian revolution#Revolutionary Council|Revolutionary Council]] and in accordance with the canonical and legal rights which originated from the vote of overwhelming majority of Iranian nation for leadership of the movement which has been represented in the vast gatherings and wide and numerous demonstrations across Iran and because of my utmost trust on your firm belief in the holy tenets of Islam and my knowledge of your precedent in Islamic and national struggles, I appoint you the authority to establish the interim government without consideration of any affiliation to any parties or dependence on any factional groups, for formation of temporary government to arrange organizing of country affairs and especially perform a referendum and refer to public vote of nation about turning the country into Islamic republic and formation of "The Council of the Founders" from the representatives of people to approve of constitution of  new regime and to hold elections of representatives of parliament of nation on the basis of the new constitution. It is necessary that you appoint and introduce the members of the temporary government as soon as possible in concordance with the conditions I have clarified. All public offices, the army, and citizens shall furnish their utmost cooperation with your interim government so as to attain the high and holy goals of this Islamic revolution and to restore order and function to the affairs of the nation. I pray to God for the success of you and your interim government in this sensitive juncture of our nation's history.|Ruhollah Al-Musavi al-Khomeini.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irdc.ir/article.asp?id=822 چرا و چگونه بازرگان به نخست وزیری رسید؟] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413172900/http://www.irdc.ir/article.asp?id=822 |date=13 April 2008 }} The commandment of Ayatollah Khomeini for Bazargan and his sermon on 5 February&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Elaborating further on his decree, Khomeini made it clear that Iranians were commanded to obey Bazargan and that this was a religious duty.

&lt;blockquote&gt;As a man who, though the guardianship [''Velayat''] that I have from the holy lawgiver [the Prophet], I hereby pronounce Bazargan as the Ruler, and since I have appointed him, he must be obeyed. The nation must obey him. This is not an ordinary government. It is a government based on the ''[[sharia]]''. Opposing this government means opposing the ''sharia'' of Islam ... Revolt against God's government is a revolt against God. Revolt against God is [[blasphemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Khomeini, ''Sahifeh-ye Nur'', vol. 5, p. 31, translated by [[Baqer Moin]] in ''Khomeini'' (2000), p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Khomeini's announcement came days before the army's official statement announcing the army's (Bakhtiar's last hope) neutrality in conflicts between Khomeini's and Bakhtiar's supporters. Bakhtiar fled on the same day, 11 February, the day that is officially named as ''Islamic Revolution's Victory Day''.

The PRG is often described as "subordinate" to the Revolutionary Council, and having had difficulties reigning in the numerous committees which were competing with its authority.&lt;ref&gt;Arjomand, ''Turban for the Crown,'' (1988) p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mohammad Ataie, the cabinet was made up of two main factions, moderates and radicals.&lt;ref name=ata&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ataie|first=Mohammad|title=Revolutionary Iran’s 1979 endeavor in Lebanon|journal=Middle East Policy|date=Summer 2013|volume=XX|issue=2|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mepo.12026/pdf|accessdate=21 August 2013|doi=10.1111/mepo.12026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of cabinet members were nationalist veterans from the [[Freedom Movement of Iran]] and the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]].

Bazargan reshuffled his cabinet several times because of resignation of ministers that were unable to cope with parallel sources of power. In several cases a ministry was supervised by an [[acting (law)|acting]] minister or Bazargan himself.

List of members of Bazargan's cabinet was as follows:

==Resignation==
The Prime Minister and all members of his cabinet resigned en masse on 6 November 1979 after American Embassy officials were taken hostage two days earlier on 4 November 1979. In his letter to Khomeini, Bazargan stated that ''"...repeated interferences, inconveniences, objections and disputes have made my colleagues and me unable to continue [meeting] our duties ..."''.

Power then passed into the hands of the Revolutionary Council. Bazargan had been a supporter of the original revolutionary draft constitution rather than theocracy by Islamic jurist, and his resignation was received by Khomeini without protest, saying "Mr. Bazargan  ... was a little tired and preferred to stay on the sidelines for a while."  Khomeini later described his appointment of Bazargan as a "mistake".&lt;ref&gt;Moin, ''Khomeini,''(2000), p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Bazargan, on the other hand, described the government as a "knife without blade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Berat|title=Between States: Interim Governments in Democratic Transitions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uy2GQmasDg4C&amp;pg=PA132|accessdate=10 August 2013|date=26 May 1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48498-5|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Isle of Flowers''''' ({{lang-pt|'''Ilha das Flores'''}}) is a 1989 [[Brazil]]ian [[short film]] by [[Jorge Furtado]]. It tracks the path of a tomato from grower to the child who collects it as food from a dump with the help of voiceover and a collection of illustrative images. The director stated the film was inspired by the works of [[Kurt Vonnegut]] and [[Alain Resnais]], among others.

The film has been denounced as "materialistic" because one of its early credits displays the phrase "God doesn't exist". Nevertheless, critic Jean-Claude Bernardet defined ''Isle of Flowers'' "a religious film", and the Brazilian National Bishop Confederation awarded the film with the Margarida de Prata (Silver Daisy), calling it "the best Brazilian film of the year" in 1990. In 1995, ''Isle of Flowers'' was chosen by the European critics as one of the 100 most important short films of the century.

==Plot==
A constant and verbose off-narrator guides the viewer through the life of a tomato. Beginning at Mr Suzuki's tomato field, the tomato is then sold to a supermarket, where it is acquired by Mrs Anete, a perfume salesperson, together with some pork. Each exchange requires the presence of money, which is, together with the tomato, the constant element in the story.
Mrs Anete intends to prepare a tomato sauce for the pork, but, having considered one of Mr Suzuki's tomatoes inadequate, she throws it in the garbage. Together with the rest of the garbage, the tomato is taken to Isle of Flowers (Ilha das Flores), [[Porto Alegre]]'s landfill. There, the organic material considered adequate is selected as food for pigs. The rest, which is considered inadequate for the pigs, is given to poor women and children to eat.

==Cast==
*[[Paulo José]] as narrator
*Ciça Reckziegel as Dona Anete
*Luciana Azevedo as Ana Luizia Nunes
*Irene Schmidt as the client
*Takahiro Suzuki as Sr. Suzuki

== Production ==

The scene of the perfume factory was actually shot in a high school laboratory (Colégio Anchieta).

'''Justice for the Elderly''' ({{lang-he-n|צדק לזקן}}, ''Tzedek LaZaken'') was a political faction in [[Israel]] between June and October 2008. It was led by [[Moshe Sharoni]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Shahar Ilan |date=3 July 2008 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/the-newest-game-show-1.248974 |title=The newest game show? |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had three seats.

==History==
The faction was established on 2 June 2008 when three MKs from [[Gil (political party)|Gil]] ([[Moshe Sharoni]], [[Elhanan Glazer]] and [[Sarah Marom]]) left the party.&lt;ref name=K&gt;[http://www.knesset.gov.il/faction/eng/FactionHistoryAll_eng.asp Mergers and Splits Among Parliamentary Groups] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; Glazer had initially decided not to quit Gil after being promised a Deputy Ministerial post (a decision which Sharoni claimed he would sue Glazer for NIS 2 million for),&lt;ref name=HA&gt;{{cite news |author=Lily Galili |author2=Mazal Mualem |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/breakaway-pensioners-agree-to-represent-gaydamak-in-knesset-1.244827 |title=Breakaway Pensioners agree to represent Gaydamak in Knesset |work=Haaretz |date=29 April 2008 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually changed his mind again and left the party.

The faction was initially planned to be associated with the [[Social Justice (political party)|Social Justice]] party,&lt;ref name=HA/&gt; with three MKs promised places in the top five on the Social Justice list in the next elections and Sharoni a senior cabinet post, as well as funding amounting to tens of thousands of [[Israeli new sheqel|shekels]] a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Yair Ettinger |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/gaydamak-former-pensioners-set-sights-on-cabinet-1.245292 |title=Gaydamak, former Pensioners set sights on cabinet seats |work=Haaretz |date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gil MK [[Yitzhak Galanti]] stated that the "move could result in Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah or Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad also 'buying' a Knesset faction to represent their views".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Shahar Ilan |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/pensioners-faction-head-if-gaydamak-can-buy-a-knesset-party-so-can-nasrallah-1.246043 |title=Pensioners faction head: If Gaydamak can buy a Knesset party, so can Nasrallah |work=Haaretz |date=18 May 2008 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the agreement was later cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/news-in-brief-ii-1.247116 |title=News in Brief II |newspaper=Haaretz |date=4 June 2008 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 15 October 2008 Sharoni announced that the faction was to merge back into Gil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mazal Mualem |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/pensioners-reunite-with-breakaway-justice-for-elderly-1.255570 |title=Pensioners reunite with breakaway Justice for Elderly |newspaper=Haaretz |date=16 October 2008 |accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger went ahead on 27 October, although Elhanan Glazer broke away to establish another new faction, [[The Right Way (political party)|The Right Way]].&lt;ref name=K/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4712">The '''Kampfgruppe gegen Unmenschlichkeit''' (KgU) (German for "Combat Group against Inhumanity") was a German anti-communist [[Resistance movement|resistance group]] based in [[West Berlin]]. It was founded in 1948 by [[Rainer Hildebrandt]], [[Günther Birkenfeld]] and [[Ernst Benda]] and existed until 1959.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.dhm.de/ausstellungen/kalter_krieg/brosch_02.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; http://www.jugendopposition.de/index.php?id=2860&lt;/ref&gt; Rainer Hildebrandt would a few years later establish the legendary [[Checkpoint Charlie Museum]].

==History==

The KgU received significant financial support from several Western intelligence agencies as well as the government of [[West Germany]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blum|first1=William|title=Killing Hope: US Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II|date=2003|publisher=Zed Books|location=London|isbn=1 84277 368 2|page=62|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=-IbQvd13uToC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=combat+groups+against+inhumanity+cia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cJqbEhBjfH&amp;sig=YHFK57eQpdgzPT4te3OqNpk2994&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjr8qG8hPPWAhVBQpoKHZq0AbMQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=combat%20groups%20against%20inhumanity%20cia&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[US Army]]'s [[Counterintelligence Corps]] (CIC) provided funding from the group's creation in the late 1940s. By the early 1950s, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) gradually replaced the CIC as the KgU's most prominent American backer. According to CIA documents, the KgU ran approximately 500 agents in East Germany in the early 1950s, which, according to historian Enrico Heitzer, put it on par with the [[Gehlen Organization]], the predecessor to the West German intelligence service [[Bundesnachrichtendienst]]. 

The KgU's activities included sabotage, arson and poison attacks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boghardt|first1=Thomas|title=The Fighting Group against Inhumanity: Resistance and Espionage in the Cold War, 1948–1959 (German title: Die Kampfgruppe gegen Unmenschlichkeit (KgU): Widerstand und Spionage im Kalten Krieg 1948–1959) Enrico Heitzer (Bӧhlau Verlag, 2015).|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-59-no-4/pdfs/Boghardt-The-Fighting-Group.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as aggressive [[economic warfare]] which intended to cause a "breakdown in the whole [East German] administrative system", such as Operation ''Osterhase'' ("Easter Bunny"), in which the group sent 150,000 fake letters to East German stores, ordering drastic price cuts in order to cause a run on already scarce consumer goods. Other activities included collecting data on individuals imprisoned in East Germany and passing it on to their relatives, as well as collecting names of informers to the East German government and passing it on to [[Rundfunk im amerikanischen Sektor|RIAS]], which would then broadcast so-called "snitch reports" in order to silence informers and discourage others from engaging in similar activities.

The KgU also aided the CIA in building up a so-called [[stay-behind]] network to be used in the event of a hypothetical [[Soviet]] invasion. Infiltration of the KgU by [[Stasi]] operatives and the arrest of several of its agents in East Germany eventually caused the group to dissolve in 1959, with many of its records going to the CIA. 

Although some KgU members, such as Rainer Hildebrandt and [[Ernst Tillich]], had served time in prison during the [[Third Reich]] for anti-Nazi activities, historian Enrico Heitzer points out that the group also used numerous activists with a [[Nazism|Nazi]] past, of which many hadn't changed their political views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boghardt|first1=Thomas|title=The Fighting Group against Inhumanity: Resistance and Espionage in the Cold War, 1948–1959 (German title: Die Kampfgruppe gegen Unmenschlichkeit (KgU): Widerstand und Spionage im Kalten Krieg 1948–1959) Enrico Heitzer (Bӧhlau Verlag, 2015).|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol-59-no-4/pdfs/Boghardt-The-Fighting-Group.pdf|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LibLab''' (short for ''Liberalt Laboratorium'' - Liberal Laboratory) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[think-tank]]. The organization was founded in 2005, and was led by chairman Martin E. Sandbu, and vice-chairman Gard Lindseth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Board|url=http://www.liblab.no/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=100&amp;Itemid=69|publisher=liblab.no|accessdate=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ended its activities in 2011. 

Their stated goals were to promote a more long-term oriented and value-based political debate in Norway, as well as to promote [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] values.

From the Liberal Laboratory Foundation’s statutes:

Liberal Laboratory Foundation is a think tank, founded on the firm belief that ideas, principles and social visions are among the strongest forces in a society’s development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Om Liberalt Laboratorium|url=http://www.liblab.no/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=35|publisher=liblab.no|accessdate=26 October 2010|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal Laboratory has two aims:

# To make Norwegian policy more long term and more value based. Liberal Laboratory shall strengthen the ideological innovation which is needed to give individuals influence over their own lives through active participation in the political process. 
# To build a vision for the future of Norway as a socially conscious, liberal society, and to strengthen political forces that further such values. Based on the values of social liberalism, Liberal Laboratory shall develop political solutions that enable individuals to take responsibility for their own lives and for the society they live in.

'''Misconceptions about HIV and AIDS''' arise from several different sources, from simple ignorance and misunderstandings about scientific knowledge regarding HIV infections and the cause of AIDS to misinformation propagated by individuals and groups with ideological stances that [[AIDS denialism|deny]] a causative relationship between HIV infection and the development of AIDS. Below is a list and explanations of some common misconceptions and their rebuttals.
{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==The relationship between HIV and AIDS==

===HIV is the same as AIDS===
HIV is an acronym for [[human immunodeficiency virus]], which is the virus that causes AIDS ([[acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]]). Contracting HIV can lead to the development of AIDS or stage 3 HIV, which causes serious damage to the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/hiv-aids/hiv-vs-aids#aids|title=HIV vs. AIDS: What’s the Difference?|work=Healthline|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this virus is the underlying cause of AIDS,&lt;ref name="NIAID, 1994-2003"/&gt; not all HIV-positive individuals have AIDS, as HIV can remain [[AIDS#Clinical latency|in a latent state]] for many years. Although usually AIDS is the late stage of an HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/hiv-aids/hiv-vs-aids#hiv-diagnosis|title=HIV vs. AIDS: What’s the Difference?|work=Healthline|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; If undiagnosed or left untreated, HIV usually progresses to AIDS, defined as possessing a CD4+ lymphocyte count under 200 cells/μl or HIV infection plus co-infection with an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection. HIV cannot be cured, but it can be treated, and its transmission can be halted. Treating HIV can prevent new infections, which is the key to ultimately defeating AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/aids/index_fight.html|title=UNICEF - Children and HIV and AIDS - What is the relationship between HIV and AIDS and emergencies?|website=UNICEF|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

===Cure===
{{see also|HIV/AIDS#Management|Management of HIV/AIDS}}
[[File:Stribild bottle Dutch labeling.jpg|thumb|A bottle containing Stribild tablets (medication used to treat HIV). Stribild is a combination drug containing [[tenofovir disoproxil fumarate]], [[emtricitabine]], [[elvitegravir]] and [[cobicistat]].]]
[[Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy]] (HAART) in many cases allows the stabilization of the patient's symptoms, partial recovery of CD4+ [[T-cell]] levels, and reduction in [[viremia]] (the level of virus in the blood) to low or near-undetectable levels. Disease-specific drugs can also alleviate symptoms of AIDS and even cure specific AIDS-defining conditions in some cases. Medical treatment can reduce HIV infection in many cases to a survivable chronic condition. However, these advances do not constitute a cure, since current treatment regimens cannot eradicate latent HIV from the body.

High levels of HIV-1 (often HAART-resistant) develop if treatment is stopped, if compliance with treatment is inconsistent, or if the virus spontaneously develops resistance to an individual's regimen.&lt;ref name ="Becker, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Becker | first1 = S. | last2 = Dezii | first2 = C.M. | last3 = Burtcel | first3 = B. | last4 = Kawabata | first4 = H. | last5 = Hodder | first5 = S. | year = 2002 | title = Young HIV-infected adults are at greater risk for medication nonadherence | url = | journal = Medscape General Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 3| page = 21 | pmid = 12466764 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antiretroviral treatment]] known as [[post-exposure prophylaxis]] reduces the chance of acquiring an HIV infection when administered within 72 hours of exposure to HIV.&lt;ref name=Fan&gt;{{Cite book|year=2005 |title=AIDS: science and society |editor=Fan, H. |editor2=Conner, R.F. |editor3=Villarreal, L.P. |edition=4th |publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers |location=[[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston, MA]] |isbn=978-0-7637-0086-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These problems mean that while HIV-positive people with low viremia are less likely to infect others, the chance of transmission always exists. In addition, people on HAART may still become sick.

===Sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure AIDS===

===Sexual intercourse with an animal will avoid or cure AIDS===
In 2002, the National Council of [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] (NSPCA) in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], recorded beliefs amongst youths that [[zoophilia|sex with animals]] is a means to avoid AIDS or cure it if infected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Aids_Focus/0,,2-7-659_1161152,00.html "Bestiality new Aids myth - SPCA"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219070401/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Aids_Focus/0,,2-7-659_1161152,00.html |date=2008-12-19 }}, March 25, 2002; retrieved February 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As with "virgin cure" beliefs, there is no scientific evidence suggesting a sexual act can actually cure AIDS, and no plausible mechanism by which it could do so has ever been proposed. The risk of contracting HIV via sex with animals is small, but the practice has its own health risks.

===HIV antibody testing is unreliable===
[[Medical diagnosis|Diagnosis]] of [[infection]] using [[ELISA|antibody testing]] is a well-established technique in [[medicine]]. HIV [[antibody]] tests exceed the performance of most other infectious disease tests in both sensitivity (the ability of the screening test to give a positive finding when the person tested truly has the disease) and specificity (the ability of the test to give a negative finding when the subjects tested are free of the disease under study). Many current HIV antibody tests have sensitivity and specificity in excess of 96% and are therefore extremely reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/diagnostics_laboratory/publications/en/HIV_Report15.pdf "HIV ASSAYS: OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS", World Health Organization, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; While most patients with HIV show an antibody response after six weeks, window periods vary and may occasionally be as long as three months.&lt;ref name=GilbertKrajden10&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=Mark|last2=Krajden|first2=Mel|title=Don't wait to test for HIV|journal=BC Medical Journal|date=July–August 2010|volume=52|issue=6|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress in testing methodology has enabled detection of viral genetic material, antigens, and the virus itself in bodily fluids and cells. While not widely used for routine testing due to high cost and requirements in laboratory equipment, these direct testing techniques have confirmed the validity of the antibody tests.&lt;ref name="Jackson, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = J.B. | last2 = Kwok | first2 = S.Y. | last3 = Sninsky | first3 = J.J. | last4 = Hopsicker | first4 = J.S. | last5 = Sannerud | first5 = K.J. | last6 = Rhame | first6 = F.S. | last7 = Henry | first7 = K. | last8 = Simpson | first8 = M. | last9 = Balfour | first9 = H.H.

Positive HIV antibody tests are usually followed up by retests and tests for [[antigen]]s, viral genetic material and the virus itself, providing confirmation of actual infection.

==HIV infection==
[[File:Symptoms of acute HIV infection.svg|thumb|Symptoms of acute HIV infection ]]

===HIV can be spread through casual contact with an HIV infected individual===
[[File:Symptoms of AIDS.svg|thumb|Symptoms of AIDS]]
One cannot become infected with HIV through normal contact in social settings, schools, or in the workplace. One cannot be infected by shaking someone's hand, by hugging or "dry" kissing someone, by using the same [[toilet]] or drinking from the same glass as an HIV-infected person, or by being exposed to [[coughing]] or [[sneezing]] by an infected person.&lt;ref name="Madhok, 1986"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Madhok | first1 = R. | last2 = Gracie | first2 = J.A. | last3 = Lowe | first3 = G.D. | last4 = Forbes | first4 = C.D. | year = 1986 | title = Lack of HIV transmission by casual contact | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 328 | issue = 8511| page = 863 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(86)92898-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Courville, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/000992289803700303 | last1 = Courville | first1 = T.M. | last2 = Caldwell | first2 = B. | last3 = Brunell | first3 = P.A. | year = 1998 | title = Lack of evidence of transmission of HIV-1 to family contacts of HIV-1 infected children | url = | journal = Clin. Pediatr. | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 175–178 | pmid = 9545605 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saliva]] carries a negligible viral load, so even open-mouthed kissing is considered a low risk. However, if the infected partner or both of the performers have blood in their mouth due to cuts, open sores, or [[gum disease]], the risk is higher. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) has only recorded one case of possible HIV transmission through kissing (involving an HIV-infected man with significant gum disease and a sexual partner also with significant gum disease),&lt;ref name= "Kissing and HIV"&gt;[http://www.thebody.com/content/art2287.html "Kissing and HIV"]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Terence Higgins Trust]] says that this is essentially a no-risk situation.&lt;ref name="THT"&gt;[http://www.tht.org.uk/informationresources/hivandaids/howhivistransmitted/wayshivisnottransmitted/ THT: "Ways HIV is not passed on"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other interactions that could ''theoretically'' result in person-to-person transmission include caring for [[nose bleed]]s and home health care procedures, yet there are very few recorded incidents of transmission occurring in these ways. A handful of cases of transmission via [[biting]] have occurred, though this is extremely rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartholomew|first1=Courtenay F|last2=Jones|first2=Avion M|title=Human bites: a rare risk factor for HIV transmission|journal=[[AIDS (journal)|AIDS]]|volume=20|issue=4|pages=631–632|doi=10.1097/01.aids.0000210621.13825.75|pmid=16470132|url=http://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/Fulltext/2006/02280/Human_bites__a_rare_risk_factor_for_HIV.21.aspx|accessdate=21 September 2014|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV-positive individuals can be detected by their appearance===
Due to media images of the effects of AIDS, many people believe that individuals infected with HIV always appear a certain way, or at least appear different from an uninfected, healthy person. In fact, disease progression can occur over a long period of time before the onset of symptoms, and as such, HIV infections cannot be detected based on appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Piya Sorcar]]|title=Teaching Taboo Topics Without Talking About Them: An Epistemic Study of a New Approach to HIV/AIDS Prevention Education in India|url=http://teachaids.org/download/dissertation-teaching-taboo-topics.pdf|publisher=[[Stanford University]], [[TeachAIDS]]|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV cannot be transmitted through oral sex===
Contracting HIV through [[oral sex]] is not impossible, but it is much lower than from [[anal sex]] and [[penile–vaginal intercourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yu|first=M|author2=Vajdy, M|title=Mucosal HIV transmission and vaccination strategies through oral compared with vaginal and rectal routes|journal=Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy|date=August 2010|volume=10|issue=8|pages=1181–95|pmid=20624114|doi=10.1517/14712598.2010.496776|pmc=2904634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV is transmitted by mosquitoes===
When [[mosquito]]es bite a person, they do not inject the blood of a previous victim into the person they bite next. Mosquitoes do, however, inject their [[saliva]] into their victims, which may carry diseases such as [[dengue fever]], [[malaria]], [[yellow fever]], or [[West Nile virus]] and can infect a bitten person with these diseases. HIV is not transmitted in this manner.&lt;ref name="Webb, 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Webb | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Happ | first2 = C.M. | last3 = Maupin | first3 = G.O. | last4 = Johnson | first4 = B.J. | last5 = Ou | first5 = C.Y. | last6 = Monath | first6 = T.P. | year = 1989 | title = Potential for insect transmission of HIV: experimental exposure of Cimex hemipterus and Toxorhynchites amboinensis to human immunodeficiency virus | url = | journal = J.

===HIV survives for only a short time outside the body===
HIV can survive at room temperature outside the body for hours if dry (provided that initial concentrations are high),&lt;ref name="Resnick, 1986"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1001/jama.255.14.1887 | last1 = Resnick | first1 = L. | last2 = Veren | first2 = K. | last3 = Salahuddin | first3 = S.Z. | last4 = Tondreau | first4 = S. | last5 = Markham | first5 = P.D. | year = 1986 | title = Stability and inactivation of HTLV-III/LAV under clinical and laboratory environments | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 255 | issue = 14| pages = 1887–1891 | pmid = 2419594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for weeks if wet (in used syringes/needles).&lt;ref name="Heimer, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heimer | first1 = R. | last2 = Abdala | first2 = N. | year = 2000 | title = Viability of HIV-1 in syringes: implications for interventions among injection drug users | url = | journal = AIDS Reader | volume = 10 | issue = 7| pages = 410–7 | pmid = 10932845 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the amounts typically present in bodily fluids do not survive nearly as long outside the body—generally no more than a few minutes if dry.&lt;ref name="Kissing and HIV"/&gt; Again, the amount of time is longer if wet, especially in syringes/needles and related equipment.

===HIV can infect only homosexual men and drug users===
{{see also|Gay-related immune deficiency|Anal sex#Health risks|History of HIV/AIDS#Unsterile injections}}
Irrespective to sexual orientation, HIV can transmit from one person to another if an engaging partner is HIV positive. In the United States, the main route of infection is via homosexual [[anal sex]], while for women transmission is primarily through heterosexual contact.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Surveillance - Epidemiology of HIV Infection (through 2008)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/slides/general/|publisher=Center for Disease Control|accessdate=1 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304014448/http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/slides/general/|archivedate=4 March 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, HIV can infect anybody, regardless of age, sex, ethnicity, or [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="Ammann, 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1984.tb37154.x | last1 = Ammann | first1 = A.J. | last2 = Wara | first2 = D.W. | last3 = Cowan | first3 = M.J. | year = 1984 | title = Pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 437 | issue = 1| pages = 340–349 | pmid = 6242000 |bibcode = 1984NYASA.437..340A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clumeck, 1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clumeck | first1 = N. | last2 = Mascart-Lemone | first2 = F. | last3 = de Maubeuge | first3 = J. | last4 = Brenez | first4 = D. | last5 = Marcelis | first5 = L. | year = 1983 | title = Acquired immune deficiency syndrome in Black Africans | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 321 | issue = 4| page = 642 | pmid = 6131313 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(83)91808-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groginsky, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Groginsky | first1 = E. | last2 = Bowdler | first2 = N. | last3 = Yankowitz | first3 = J. | year = 1998 | title = Update on vertical HIV transmission | url = | journal = J Reprod Med | volume = 43 | issue = 8| pages = 637–46 | pmid = 9749412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxtoby, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oxtoby | first1 = M.J. | year = 1990 | title = Perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection | url = http://journals.lww.com/pidj/Citation/1990/09000/PERSPECTIVES_ON_PEDIATRIC_HUMAN_IMMUNODEFICIENCY.2.aspx| journal = Pediatr.

===An HIV-infected mother cannot have children===
HIV-infected women remain fertile, although in late stages of HIV disease a pregnant woman may have a higher risk of [[miscarriage]]. Normally, the risk of transmitting HIV to the unborn child is between 15 and 30%. However, this may be reduced to just 2–3% if patients carefully follow medical guidelines.&lt;ref name="Groginsky, 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO, 2005"&gt;[http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/stis/index.htm WHO, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV cannot be the cause of AIDS because the body develops a vigorous antibody response to the virus===
This reasoning ignores numerous examples of [[virus]]es other than HIV that can be [[pathogenic]] after evidence of [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] appears. [[Measles]] virus may persist for years in [[brain]] cells, eventually causing a chronic neurologic disease despite the presence of [[antibodies]]. Viruses such as ''[[Cytomegalovirus]]'', [[Herpes simplex virus|''Herpes simplex'' virus]], and ''[[Varicella zoster]]'' may be activated after years of latency even in the presence of abundant antibodies. In other animals, viral relatives of HIV with long and variable latency periods, such as [[visna virus]] in [[sheep]], cause [[central nervous system]] damage even after the production of antibodies.&lt;ref name="NIAID, 1995"&gt;"DISEASE PROGRESSION DESPITE ANTIBODIES", "The Relationship Between the Human Immunodeficiency Virus and the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome", [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]], September, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV has a well-recognized capacity to [[mutate]] to evade the ongoing immune response of the host.&lt;ref name="Levy, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levy | first1 = J.A. | year = 1993 | title = Pathogenesis of human immunodeficiency virus infection | url = | journal = Microbiol. Rev. | volume = 57 | issue = 1| pages = 183–289 | pmid = 8464405 | pmc = 372905 | bibcode = 1989NYASA.567...58L | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1989.tb16459.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Only a small number of CD4+ T-cells are infected by HIV, not enough to damage the immune system===
Although the fraction of CD4+ T-cells that is infected with HIV at any given time is never high (only a small subset of activated cells serve as ideal targets of infection), several groups have shown that rapid cycles of death of infected cells and infection of new target cells occur throughout the course of the disease.&lt;ref name="Richman, 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1172/JCI9478 | last1 = Richman | first1 = D.D. | year = 2000 | title = Normal physiology and HIV pathophysiology of human T-cell dynamics | url = | journal = J. Clin. Invest. | volume = 105 | issue = 5| pages = 565–566 | pmid = 10712427 | pmc = 292457 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Macrophage]]s and other cell types are also infected with HIV and serve as reservoirs for the virus.

Furthermore, like other viruses, HIV is able to suppress the immune system by secreting proteins that interfere with it. For example, HIV's [[Capsid|coat protein]], [[gp120]], sheds from viral particles and binds to the [[CD4]] receptors of otherwise healthy T-cells; this interferes with the normal function of these signalling receptors. Another HIV protein, [[HIV structure and genome#Genome organization|Tat]], has been demonstrated to suppress T cell activity.

Infected lymphocytes express the [[Fas ligand]], a cell-surface protein that triggers the death of neighboring uninfected T-cells expressing the [[Fas receptor]].&lt;ref name="Xu, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1084/jem.189.9.1489 | last1 = Xu | first1 = X.N. | last2 = Laffert | first2 = B. | last3 = Screaton | first3 = G.R. | last4 = Kraft | first4 = M. | last5 = Wolf | first5 = D. | last6 = Kolanus | first6 = W. | last7 = Mongkolsapay | first7 = J. | last8 = McMichael | first8 = A.J. | last9 = Baur | first9 = A.S. |display-authors=etal | year = 1999 | title = Induction of Fas ligand expression by HIV involves the interaction of Nef with the T cell receptor zeta chain | url = | journal = J.

The current consensus is that HIV was introduced to North America by a Haitian immigrant who contracted it while working in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in the early 1960s, or from another person who worked there during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7068574.stm |work=BBC News |title=Key HIV strain 'came from Haiti' |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 on June 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) publish a ''Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report'' (MMWR), describing cases of a rare lung infection, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), from five healthy, gay men in Los Angeles.

Origin of AIDS through human–monkey sexual intercourse{{See also|HIV/AIDS#Origins}}
While HIV is most likely a mutated form of [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV), a disease present only in chimpanzees and [[Old World monkey|African monkeys]], highly plausible explanations for the transfer of the disease between species ([[zoonosis]]) exist not involving [[bestiality|sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref name=Locatelli2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Locatelli|first=S|author2=Peeters, M|title=Cross-species transmission of simian retroviruses: how and why they could lead to the emergence of new diseases in the human population|journal=AIDS  |date=Mar 27, 2012|volume=26|issue=6|pages=659–73|pmid=22441170|doi=10.1097/QAD.0b013e328350fb68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the African chimpanzees and monkeys which carry SIV are often [[hunting|hunted]] for food, and epidemiologists theorize that the disease may have appeared in humans after hunters came into blood-contact with monkeys infected with SIV that they had killed.&lt;ref name=Sharp2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharp|first=PM|author2=Hahn, BH|title=Origins of HIV and the AIDS Pandemic|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine|date=September 2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=a006841|pmid=22229120|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a006841|pmc=3234451}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known instance of HIV in a human was found in a person who died in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in 1959,&lt;ref name="Zhu, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/35400 | last1 = Zhu | first1 = T. | last2 = Korber | first2 = B.T. | last3 = Nahmias | first3 = A.J. | last4 = Hooper | first4 = E. | last5 = Sharp | first5 = P.M. | last6 = Ho | first6 = D.D. | year = 1998 | title = An African HIV-1 sequence from 1959 and implications for the origin of the epidemic | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 391 | issue = 6667| pages = 594–597 | pmid = 9468138 |bibcode = 1998Natur.391..594Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a recent study dates the last common ancestor of HIV and SIV to between 1884 and 1914 by using a [[molecular clock]] approach.&lt;ref name="nature07390"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Worobey |first=Michael |date=2 October 2008 |title=Direct evidence of extensive diversity of HIV-1 in Kinshasa by 1960 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=455 |issue=7293 |pages=661–664 |doi=10.1038/nature07390  |pmid=18833279 |first2=Marlea |last2=Gemmel |first3=3=Dirk E. |last3=Teuwen |display-authors=2 |last4=Haselkorn |first4=Tamara |last5=Kunstman |first5=Kevin |last6=Bunce |first6=Michael |last7=Muyembe |first7=Jean-Jacques |last8=Kabongo |first8=Jean-Marie M. |last9=Kalengayi |first9=Raphaël M.|last10=Van Marck |first10=Eric |last11=Gilbert |first11=M.

==AIDS denialism==
{{Main|AIDS conspiracy theories|AIDS denialism}}

===There is no AIDS in Africa, as AIDS is nothing more than a new name for old diseases===
The diseases that have come to be associated with [[AIDS in Africa]], such as [[cachexia]], diarrheal diseases and [[tuberculosis]] have long been severe burdens there. However, high rates of [[death|mortality]] from these diseases, formerly confined to the elderly and [[malnourish]]ed, are now common among HIV-infected young and [[middle-age]]d people, including well-educated members of the [[middle class]].&lt;ref name="UNAIDS, 2000"&gt;UNAIDS, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in a study in [[Côte d'Ivoire]], HIV-[[seropositive]] individuals with [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] were 17 times more likely to die within six months than HIV-seronegative individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="Ackah, 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(95)90519-7 | last1 = Ackah | first1 = A.N. | last2 = Coulibaly | first2 = D. | last3 = Digbeu | first3 = H. | last4 = Diallo | first4 = K. | last5 = Vetter | first5 = K.M. | last6 = Coulibaly | first6 = I.M. | last7 = Greenberg | first7 = A.E. | last8 = De Cock | first8 = K.M. | year = 1995 | title = Response to treatment, mortality, and CD4 lymphocyte counts in HIV-infected persons with tuberculosis in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 345 | issue = 8950| pages = 607–610 | pmid = 7898177 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Malawi]], mortality over three years among children who had received recommended childhood [[immunization]]s and who survived the first year of life was 9.5 times higher among HIV-seropositive children than among HIV-seronegative children. The leading causes of death were wasting and respiratory conditions.&lt;ref name="Taha, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/00006454-199908000-00007 | last1 = Taha | first1 = T.E. | last2 = Kumwenda | first2 = N.I. | last3 = Broadhead | first3 = R.L. | last4 = Hoover | first4 = D.R. | last5 = Graham | first5 = S.M. | last6 = Van Der | first6 = Hoven L. | last7 = Markakis | first7 = D. | last8 = Liomba | first8 = G.N. | last9 = Chiphangwi | first9 = J.D. | last10 = Miotti | first10 = Paolo G. | year = 1999 | title = Mortality after the first year of life among human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected and uninfected children | url = | journal = Pediatr.

===HIV is not the cause of AIDS===
{{Main|AIDS denialism}}
There is broad [[scientific consensus]] that HIV is the cause of AIDS, but some individuals reject this consensus, including biologist [[Peter Duesberg]], biochemist [[David Rasnick]], journalist/activist [[Celia Farber]], conservative writer [[Tom Bethell]], and [[intelligent design]] advocate [[Phillip E. Johnson]]. (Some one-time skeptics have since rejected AIDS denialism, including physiologist [[Robert Root-Bernstein]], and physician and AIDS researcher [[Joseph Sonnabend]].)

A great deal is known about the [[pathogenesis]] of HIV disease, even though important details remain to be elucidated. However, a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of a disease is not a prerequisite to knowing its cause. Most infectious agents have been associated with the disease they cause long before their pathogenic mechanisms have been discovered. Because research in pathogenesis is difficult when precise animal models are unavailable, the disease-causing mechanisms in many diseases, including [[tuberculosis]] and [[hepatitis B]], are poorly understood, but the pathogens responsible are very well established.&lt;ref name="NIAID, 1994-2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/howHIVCausesAIDS/Pages/HIVcausesAIDS.aspx |title=The Evidence that HIV Causes AIDS |last=|first=|date=4 September 2009|website=|publisher=[[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease]] |archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====AZT and other antiretroviral drugs, not HIV, cause AIDS====
{{Main|Duesberg hypothesis}}
The vast majority of people with AIDS never received antiretroviral drugs, including those in developed countries prior to the licensure of [[Zidovudine|AZT]] in 1987. Even today, very few individuals in developing countries have access to these medications.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS, 2003"&gt;[http://www.unaids.org/html/pub/publications/fact-sheets04/fs_treatment_en_pdf.pdf UNAIDS, 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614103019/http://www.unaids.org/html/pub/publications/fact-sheets04/fs_treatment_en_pdf.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, [[clinical trial]]s enrolling patients with AIDS found that AZT given as single-drug therapy conferred a modest (and short-lived) survival advantage compared to [[placebo]]. Among HIV-infected patients who had not yet developed AIDS, placebo-controlled trials found that AZT given as a single-drug therapy delayed, for a year or two, the onset of AIDS-related illnesses. The lack of excess AIDS cases and death in the AZT arms of these placebo-controlled trials effectively counters the argument that AZT causes AIDS.&lt;ref name="NIAID, 1995"/&gt;

Subsequent clinical trials found that patients receiving two-drug combinations had up to 50% increases in time to progression to AIDS and in survival when compared to people receiving single-drug therapy. In more recent years, three-drug combination therapies have produced another 50–80% improvements in progression to AIDS and in survival when compared to two-drug regimens in clinical trials.&lt;ref name="HHS, 2005"&gt;[http://www.hivatis.org/guidelines/adult/AA_040705.pdf HHS, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Use of potent anti-HIV combination therapies has contributed to dramatic reductions in the incidence of AIDS and AIDS-related deaths in populations where these drugs are widely available, an effect which would be unlikely if antiretroviral drugs ''caused'' AIDS.&lt;ref name="Palella, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199803263381301 | last1 = Palella | first1 = F.J.

====Behavioral factors such as recreational drug use and multiple sexual partners—not HIV—account for AIDS====
The proposed behavioral causes of AIDS, such as multiple sexual partners and long-term [[recreational drug use]], have existed for many years. The epidemic of AIDS, characterized by the occurrence of formerly rare opportunistic infections such as ''[[Pneumocystis carinii]]'' pneumonia (PCP), did not occur in the United States until a previously unknown human [[retrovirus]]—HIV—spread through certain communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/publications/hivaids/21.htm |title=NIAID |last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compelling evidence against the hypothesis that behavioral factors cause AIDS comes from recent studies that have followed cohorts of [[homosexual]] men for long periods of time and found that only HIV-seropositive men develop AIDS. For example, in a prospectively studied cohort in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], 715 homosexual men were followed for a median of 8.6 years. Among 365 HIV-positive individuals, 136 developed AIDS. No AIDS-defining illnesses occurred among 350 seronegative men, despite the fact that these men reported appreciable use of [[nitrite inhalants]] ("poppers") and other recreational drugs, and frequent receptive [[anal intercourse]] (Schechter et al., 1993).&lt;ref name="Schechter, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(93)90421-C | last1 = Schechter | first1 = M.T. | last2 = Craib | first2 = K.J. | last3 = Gelmon | first3 = K.A. | last4 = Montaner | first4 = J.S. | last5 = Le | first5 = T.N. | last6 = O'Shaughnessy | first6 = M.V. | year = 1993 | title = HIV-1 and the aetiology of AIDS | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 341 | issue = 8846| pages = 658–659 | pmid = 8095571 | last7 = Schechter | first7 = M.T. | last8 = Gelmon | first8 = K.A. | last9 = Montaner | first9 = J.S.G.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies show that among homosexual men and injection-drug users, the specific immune deficit that leads to AIDS—a progressive and sustained loss of [[CD4]]+ [[T-cell]]s—is extremely rare in the absence of other immunosuppressive conditions. For example, in the [[Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study]], more than 22,000 T-cell determinations in 2,713 HIV-seronegative homosexual men revealed only one individual with a CD4+ T-cell count persistently lower than 300 cells/µl of blood, and this individual was receiving [[immunosuppressive therapy]].&lt;ref name="Vermund, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vermund | first1 = S.H. | last2 = Hoover | first2 = D.R. | last3 = Chen | first3 = K. | year = 1993 | title = CD4+ counts in seronegative homosexual men.

In a survey of 229 HIV-seronegative injection-drug users in [[New York City]], mean CD4+ T-cell counts of the group were consistently more than 1000 cells/µl of blood. Only two individuals had two CD4+ T-cell measurements of less than 300/µl of blood, one of whom died with cardiac disease and [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] listed as the cause of death.&lt;ref name="Des Jarlais, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Des Jarlais | first1 = D.C. | last2 = Friedman | first2 = S.R. | last3 = Marmor | first3 = M. | last4 = Mildvan | first4 = D. | last5 = Yancovitz | first5 = S. | last6 = Sotheran | first6 = J.L. | last7 = Wenston | first7 = J. | last8 = Beatrice | first8 = S. | year = 1993 | title = CD4 lymphocytopenia among injecting drug users in New York City | url = | journal = J.

====AIDS among transfusion recipients is due to underlying diseases that necessitated the transfusion, rather than to HIV====
This notion is contradicted by a report by the Transfusion Safety Study Group (TSSG), which compared HIV-negative and HIV-positive blood recipients who had been given [[blood transfusions]] for similar diseases. Approximately 3 years following blood transfusion, the mean CD4+ T-cell count in 64 HIV-negative recipients was 850/µl of blood, while 111 HIV-seropositive individuals had average CD4+ T-cell counts of 375/µl of blood. By 1993, there were 37 cases of AIDS in the HIV-infected group, but not a single AIDS-defining illness in the HIV-seronegative transfusion recipients.&lt;ref name="Donegan, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Donegan | first1 = E. | last2 = Stuart | first2 = M. | last3 = Niland | first3 = J.C. | last4 = Sacks | first4 = H.S. | last5 = Azen | first5 = S.P. | last6 = Dietrich | first6 = S.L. | last7 = Faucett | first7 = C. | last8 = Fletcher | first8 = M.A. | last9 = Kleinman | first9 = S.H. |display-authors=etal | year = 1990 | title = Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) among recipients of antibody-positive blood donations | url = | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 113 | issue = 10| pages = 733–9 | pmid = 2240875  | doi=10.7326/0003-4819-113-10-733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.7992044 | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J. | year = 1994 | title = Duesberg and critics agree: hemophilia is the best test | url = | journal = Science | volume = 266 | issue = 5191| pages = 1645–1646 | pmid = 7992044 | bibcode=1994Sci...266.1645C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====High usage of clotting factor concentrate, not HIV, leads to CD4+ T-cell depletion and AIDS in hemophiliacs====
This view is contradicted by many studies. For example, among HIV-seronegative patients with [[hemophilia A]] enrolled in the Transfusion Safety Study, no significant differences in CD4+ T-cell counts were noted between 79 patients with no or minimal factor treatment and 52 with the largest amount of lifetime treatments. Patients in both groups had CD4+ T-cell-counts within the normal range.&lt;ref name="Hasset, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hassett | first1 = J. | last2 = Gjerset | first2 = G.F. | last3 = Mosley | first3 = J.W. | last4 = Fletcher | first4 = M.A. | last5 = Donegan | first5 = E. | last6 = Parker | first6 = J.W. | last7 = Counts | first7 = R.B. | last8 = Aledort | first8 = L.M. | last9 = Lee | first9 = H. |display-authors=etal | year = 1993 | title = Effect on lymphocyte subsets of clotting factor therapy in human immunodeficiency virus-1-negative congenital clotting disorders.

In a cohort in the [[United Kingdom]], researchers matched 17 HIV-seropositive [[hemophiliac]]s with 17 HIV-seronegative hemophiliacs with regard to clotting factor concentrate usage over a ten-year period. During this time, 16 AIDS-defining clinical events occurred in 9 patients, all of whom were HIV-seropositive. No AIDS-defining illnesses occurred among the HIV-negative patients. In each pair, the mean CD4+ T-cell count during follow-up was, on average, 500 cells/µl lower in the HIV-seropositive patient.&lt;ref name="Sabin, 1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sabin | first1 = C.A. | last2 = Pasi | first2 = K.J. | last3 = Phillips | first3 = A.N. | last4 = Lilley | first4 = P. | last5 = Bofill | first5 = M. | last6 = Lee | first6 = C.A. | year = 1996 | title = Comparison of immunodeficiency and AIDS defining conditions in HIV negative and HIV positive men with haemophilia A | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 312 | issue = 7025| pages = 207–10 | pmid = 8563582 | pmc = 2349998 | doi=10.1136/bmj.312.7025.207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among HIV-infected hemophiliacs, Transfusion Safety Study investigators found that neither the purity nor the amount of factor VIII therapy had a deleterious effect on CD4+ T-cell counts.&lt;ref name="Gjerset, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gjerset | first1 = G.F. | last2 = Pike | first2 = M.C. | last3 = Mosley | first3 = J.W. | last4 = Hassett | first4 = J. | last5 = Fletcher | first5 = M.A. | last6 = Donegan | first6 = E. | last7 = Parker | first7 = J.W. | last8 = Counts | first8 = R.B. | last9 = Zhou | first9 = Y. |display-authors=etal | year = 1994 | title = Effect of low- and intermediate-purity clotting factor therapy on progression of human immunodeficiency virus infection in congenital clotting disorders.

====The distribution of AIDS cases casts doubt on HIV as the cause. Viruses are not gender-specific, yet only a small proportion of AIDS cases are among women====
The distribution of AIDS cases, whether in the United States or elsewhere in the world, invariably mirrors the prevalence of HIV in a population. In the United States, HIV first appeared in populations of [[injection-drug]] users (a majority of whom are male) and [[gay]] men. HIV is spread primarily through unprotected sex, the exchange of HIV-contaminated needles, or cross-contamination of the drug solution and infected blood during intravenous drug use. Because these behaviors show a gender skew—Western men are more likely to take illegal drugs intravenously than Western women, and men are more likely to report higher levels of the riskiest sexual behaviors, such as unprotected [[anal intercourse]]—it is not surprising that a majority of U.S. AIDS cases have occurred in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/international/ |title=U.S. Census Bureau |last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in the United States, however, are increasingly becoming HIV-infected, usually through the exchange of HIV-contaminated needles or sex with an HIV-infected male. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] estimates that 30 percent of new HIV infections in the United States in 1998 were in women. As the number of HIV-infected women has risen, so too has the number of female AIDS patients in the United States. Approximately 23% of U.S. adult/adolescent AIDS cases reported to the CDC in 1998 were among women. In 1998, AIDS was the fifth leading cause of death among women aged 25 to 44 in the United States, and the third leading cause of death among African-American women in that age group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/aidsstat.htm |title=AIDS/HIV Statics |last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Africa, HIV was first recognized in sexually active [[heterosexual]]s, and AIDS cases in Africa have occurred at least as frequently in women as in men. Overall, the worldwide distribution of HIV infection and AIDS between men and women is approximately 1 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/international/ |title=U.S. Bureau Census |last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], 57% of adults with HIV are women, and young women aged 15 to 24 are more than three times as likely to be infected as young men.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS, 2005"&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/upload/lib_pub_file/308_filename_women_aids1.pdf UNAIDS, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

====HIV is not the cause of AIDS because many individuals with HIV have not developed AIDS====
HIV infections have a prolonged and variable course. The median period of time between infection with HIV and the onset of clinically apparent disease is approximately 10 years in [[industrialized countries]], according to prospective studies of homosexual men in which dates of [[seroconversion]] are known. Similar estimates of asymptomatic periods have been made for HIV-infected blood-transfusion recipients, injection-drug users and adult hemophiliacs.&lt;ref name="Alcabes, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alcabes | first1 = P. | last2 = Munoz | first2 = A. | last3 = Vlahov | first3 = D. | last4 = Friedland | first4 = G.H. | year = 1993 | title = Incubation period of human immunodeficiency virus | url = | journal = Epidemiol. Rev. | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 303–18 | pmid = 8174659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many diseases, a number of factors can influence the course of HIV disease. Factors such as age or genetic differences between individuals, the level of virulence of the individual strain of virus, as well as exogenous influences such as co-infection with other microbes may determine the rate and severity of HIV disease expression. Similarly, some people infected with [[hepatitis B]], for example, show no symptoms or only [[jaundice]] and clear their infection, while others suffer disease ranging from chronic [[liver]] inflammation to [[cirrhosis]] and hepatocellular carcinoma. Co-factors probably also determine why some smokers develop [[lung cancer]] while others do not.&lt;ref name="Levy, 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans, 1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = A.S. | year = 1982 | title = The clinical illness promotion factor: a third ingredient | url = | journal = Yale J. Biol. Med. | volume = 55 | issue = 3–4| pages = 193–9 | pmid = 6295003 | pmc = 2596440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fauci, 1996"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/384529a0 | last1 = Fauci | first1 = A.S. | year = 1996 | title = Host factors and the pathogenesis of HIV-induced disease | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1233194| journal = Nature | volume = 384 | issue = 6609| pages = 529–534 | pmid = 8955267 |bibcode = 1996Natur.384..529F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====HIV is not the cause of AIDS because some people have symptoms associated with AIDS but are not infected with HIV====
Most AIDS symptoms result from the development of [[opportunistic infection]]s and [[cancer]]s associated with severe [[immunosuppression]] secondary to HIV.

However, immunosuppression has many other potential causes. Individuals who take [[glucocorticoid]]s or immunosuppressive drugs to prevent [[organ transplant|transplant]] rejection or to treat [[autoimmune disease]]s can have increased susceptibility to unusual infections, as do individuals with certain [[genetics|genetic]] conditions, severe [[malnutrition]] and certain kinds of cancers. There is no evidence suggesting that the numbers of such cases have risen, while abundant [[epidemiologic]] evidence shows a very large rise in cases of immunosuppression among individuals who share one characteristic: HIV infection.&lt;ref name="NIAID, 1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAIDS, 2000"/&gt;

====The spectrum of AIDS-related infections seen in different populations proves that AIDS is actually many diseases not caused by HIV====
[[File:Pneumocystis jiroveci infection (3833203709).jpg|thumb|[[Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia]] ]]
[[File:Bacteria on Warthin–Starry stain.jpg|thumb|[[Mycobacterium avium complex]] ]]
The diseases associated with AIDS, such as [[Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia]] (PCP) and [[Mycobacterium avium complex]] (MAC), are not caused by HIV, but rather result from the immunosuppression caused by HIV disease. As the immune system of an HIV-infected individual weakens, he or she becomes susceptible to the particular [[virus|viral]], [[fungus|fungal]], and [[bacteria]]l infections common in the community. For example, HIV-infected people in the [[Midwestern United States]] are much more likely than people in [[New York City]] to develop [[histoplasmosis]], which is caused by a fungus. A person in Africa is exposed to pathogens different from individuals in an American city. Children may be exposed to infectious agents different from adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hivatis.org/guidelines/op_infections/OI_112801.html |title=USPHS/IDSA |last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV is the underlying cause of the condition named AIDS, but the additional conditions that may affect an AIDS patient are dependent upon the [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] [[pathogens]] to which the patient may be exposed.

===AIDS can be prevented with complementary or alternative medicine===
Many HIV-infected people turn to complementary and [[alternative medicine]], such as traditional medicine, especially in areas where conventional therapies are less widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Littlewood|first1=RA|last2=Vanable|first2=PA|title=A global perspective on complementary and alternative medicine use among people living with HIV/AIDS in the era of antiretroviral treatment|journal=Curr.

'''Nicholas Joseph Fuentes''' (born August 18, 1998) is an American YouTube personality and political commentator. He regularly hosts the ''America First'' podcast and formerly hosted ''Nationalist Review'', with co-host [[James Allsup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nicholasjfuentes.com/|title=Nicholas J. Fuentes|last=|first=|date=|website=Nicholas J. Fuentes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been called [[Far-right politics|far-right]] and [[alt-right]], terms he rejects. He previously worked as a host on the [[Right Side Broadcasting Network]], but was removed after calling for violence against journalists. He later left [[Boston University]] after allegedly receiving several death threats and stated he intends to transfer to [[Auburn University]], though he has yet to confirm enrollment.

== Early life and education ==
Fuentes graduated from [[Lyons Township High School]], and was the school's student council president. He initially attended [[Boston University]], but later dropped out to attend the [[Unite the Right rally]] rally in Charlottevile, Virginia. Fuentes has stated he intends to transfer to [[Auburn University]], as it is within a staunch [[Alabama|red state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2017/08/alt-right_figure_says_hes_been.html|title=Alt-right figure says he's been admitted to Auburn|last=|first=|date=|website=AL.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/western-springs/news/ct-dlg-lt-grad-death-threats-tl-0824-20170818-story.html|title=Area teen rallied in Charlottesville, got death threats, now planning move to 'solidly red' Alabama|last=Mannion|first=Annemarie|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-04-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being admitted for the fall 2017 semester, he failed to confirm his enrollment and must apply for the spring semester by the deadline of October 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2017/08/if_alt-rights_nicholas_fuentes.html|title=Nicholas Fuentes was admitted to Auburn in May for 2017 fall semester, school says; he must reapply for spring|last=|first=|date=|website=AL.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

In [[sociology]], '''nomos''' refers to provisional codes (habits or customs) of social and political behavior, socially constructed and historically (even geographically) specific. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jarratt|first=Susan Carole Funderburgh|title=Rereading the Sophists: Classical Rhetoric Refigured|year=1991|publisher=Southern Illinois UP|location=Carbondale}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from the Greek νόμος, and it refers not only to explicit laws but to all of the normal rules and forms people take for granted in their day-to-day activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=Law, Legislation and Liberty|year=1982|publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415522298|pages=90–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomos stands for order, valid and binding on those who fall under its jurisdiction; thus it is a social construct with ethical dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ostwald|first=Martin|title=Nomos and the Beginnings of the Athenian Democracy|year=1969|publisher=Oxford UP|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a belief, opinion or point of view; it is a human invention.

== History of the term ==

[[Carl Schmitt]] began using the term in his 1934 publication "On the Three Types of Juristic Thought"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Carl|others=trans Joseph Bendersky|title=On the Three Types of Juristic Thought |year=2004|publisher=Praeger|pages=49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; to denote the "concrete order" of a people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehring|first=Reinhard|title=Carl Schmitt: A Biography|year=2014|publisher=Polity|isbn=9780745652245|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; before extending its use into his 1950 book "The Nomos of the Earth in the International Law of the Jus Publicum Europaeum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schmitt/#LibCosFouIntOrd|title=Carl Schmitt|last=Vinx|first=Lars|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bergerian nomos ===

After Schmitt, the next influential writer to use the term in a modern context is [[Peter L. Berger]]. Berger writes of human beings fashioning a world by their own activity (1967:5). Berger sees this taking place through a continual threefold cycle between individuals and society: externalisation, objectivation and internalization. The world thus fashioned has an order&amp;mdash;a set of principles&amp;mdash;which comes to be read onto society by individuals through externalisation and objectivation, and also internalised in each individual. This order thus comes to be assumed, spoken of, and placed into social discourse to be treated as common sense. This ordering of the world and experience, which is a corporate and social process as well as an individual one, is a nomos.

Berger writes of 'The socially established nomos' being understood 'as a shield against terror. Put differently, the most important function of society is nomization.' (1967:22). We all need that structuring nomos; it provides us with stability, predictability, a frame of reference in which to live. The alternative is the chaos and terror of what Berger calls anomy.

To be most effective, the nomos must be taken for granted. The structure of the world created by human and social activity is treated not as contingent, but as self-evident. 'Whenever the socially established nomos attains the quality of being taken for granted, there occurs a merging of its meanings with what are considered to be the fundamental meanings inherent in the universe.' (1967:24-25). Berger sees this happening in all societies, and while the nomos is expressed in religious terms in 'archaic societies', 'In contemporary society, this archaic cosmization of the social world is likely to take the form of "scientific" propositions about the nature of men rather than the nature of the universe.' (1967:25).

So this process of world-construction is not necessarily religious, but its expression has most often been religious. Later Berger explores the part religious belief has played in nomoi: providing a connection with the cosmic—seeking to provide a completeness to that religious world-view.

'Every human society is an edifice of externalized and objectivated meanings, always intending a meaningful totality. Every society is engaged in the never completed enterprise of building a humanly meaningful world. Cosmization implies the identification of this humanly meaningful world with the world as such, the former now being grounded in the latter, reflecting it or being derived from it in its fundamental structures. Such a cosmos, as the ultimate ground and validation of human nomoi, need not necessarily be sacred. Particularly in modern times there have been thoroughly secular attempts at cosmization, among which modern science is by far the most important. It is safe to say, however, that originally all cosmization had a sacred character.' (1967:27).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=The Sacred Canopy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coverian nomos===

The next landmark in the use of the term is generally thought to be by [[Robert Cover]], who argued in his influential 1982 paper [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3690&amp;context=fss_papers Nomos and Narrative] that while the mechanisms of law and social control are part of law, that students of the law, and legal actors, should instead focus on the [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] universe, the whole of the means of social control. As with Berger, Cover rooted the nomos in "narrative", or what a post-structuralist would call [[meta-narrative]]. Cover argued that no set of legal institutions exists apart from the narratives that locate it and give it meaning.

He says this because he argues that our moral sense is composed of the narratives from which we draw conclusions, and by which we locate ourselves in relation to other people. He argues that because narrative is morality, the normative universe must rest on narrative. Since we also construct our view of the universe physically from narrative, he argues that the normative universe is as much a part of our existence as the physical universe.

Cover then makes an argument of incorporation: he states that just as we develop increasingly complex responses to the physical world, so too is our development of responses to "[[Other (philosophy)|otherness]]" conditioned over time by interaction. From this he argues that societies that have great legal systems rest on more than formal and technical virtuosity, but in the richness of their understanding of the normative universe.

Cover argues that the explicit relationship between formal apparatus of a society, in this case a legal society, and the normative range of behavior is the fulcrum to understanding whether the society is functional or not.

Cover's use of the term is rooted in Berger's argument that nomos requires mythology and narrative, as pillars for the understanding of the meaning of each act within a particular nomos.

The '''Norfolk four-course system''' is a method of agriculture that involves [[crop rotation]]. Unlike other methods such as the [[three-field system]], the Norfolk system is marked by an absence of a [[fallow]] year. Instead, four different crops are grown in each year of a four-year cycle: [[wheat]], [[turnip]]s, [[barley]], and [[clover]] or undergrass. It was developed in [[Norfolk]], England in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Norfolk-four-course-system|title=Norfolk four-course system|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Palestinian National Unity Government of March 2007''' ({{lang-ar|'''المجلس الفلسطيني لآذار 17 2007'''}}) was a [[Palestinian Authority]] unity government from March to June 2007, headed by [[Ismail Haniyeh]], the [[Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority]].&lt;ref name=arabnews/&gt;

The Unity Government was formed on 17 March 2007 following negotiations in Mecca, but due to failing international support because it did not meet the Quartet conditions, it was short-living. Israel immediately rejected the Government and said it will deal with Abbas, but not with the new government unless it recognizes the Jewish state. Israeli officials said they would try to persuade the world not to deal with the government.&lt;ref name=arabnews/&gt;

After a [[Battle of Gaza (2007)|Fatah–Hamas battle]], the Government was dissolved by [[President of the Palestinian National Authority|President Mahmoud Abbas]] on 14 June 2007.

== Background ==

After the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|2006 elections]] which Hamas won, [[Battle of Gaza (2007)#The plan to replace the government|Fatah developed a plan]] to replace the [[Palestinian government of March 2006|Hamas-government]]. According to the plan, a national unity government or a "government of technocrats" would be formed and prepare early presidential and legislative elections. If the establishment of a government meeting the Quartet conditions would fail, President Abbas would announce a state of emergency, dismiss the present cabinet and form an emergency government, or call for early elections.&lt;ref name=PP_Vision&gt;[http://thepalestinepapers.com/files/767.PDF ''Palestinian Vision for Resolving the Current PA Crisis (Draft #6'')].

==Timeline==
On 25 January 2006, [[Hamas]] won the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006|parliamentary elections]]. [[Israel]], the [[United States]], the [[European Union]] and several [[Western world|Western states]] then imposed sanctions suspending all [[foreign aid]], upon which Palestinians depend.

In March 2006, the [[Palestinian Authority Government of March 2006|previous Government]] was installed.

On 8 February 2007, negotiations in [[Mecca]] brokered by [[Saudi Arabia]] produced the [[Fatah–Hamas Mecca Agreement]], an agreement to form a Palestinian national unity government.&lt;ref name="ICG62"&gt;[http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/Israel%20Palestine/62_after_mecca__engaging_hamas Middle East Report No. 62: After Mecca: Engaging Hamas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903112003/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/Israel%20Palestine/62_after_mecca__engaging_hamas |date=3 September 2012 }}, [[International Crisis Group]] (February 26, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement was signed by [[Mahmoud Abbas]] on behalf of Fatah and by [[Khaled Mashal]] on behalf of Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/08/israel Palestinian rivals sign power-sharing deal], Associated Press (February 8, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement also contained a "letter of commission" from Abbas to Prime Minister [[Ismail Haniyeh]] of Hamas, calling on Haniyeh as premier of the next government to  achieve Palestinian national goals as approved by the [[Palestine National Council]], the clauses of the Basic Law and the National Reconciliation Document (the [[Prisoners' Document]]) as well as the decisions of the Arab summit.&lt;ref name="ICG62"/&gt;

On 17 March, [[Ismail Haniyeh]] presented his new national unity government before the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]].&lt;ref name=hanieh_speech_2007_gov&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091004212506/http://www.jmcc.org/politics/pna/haniehspeechmar07.htm ''PM Hanieh Speech before the PLC March 17, 2007''].

'''Patriots''' ({{lang-es|Patriotas}}) was the name that the people of the [[Spanish America]] who rebelled against Spanish control during the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] called themselves. They supported the principles of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and sought to replace the existing governing structures with [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Juntas]]. At first they declared themselves loyal to [[Ferdinand VII]], who was captive of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and who seemed a supporter of the new ideals because of his conflict with his father, the [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]]. However, when Ferdinand VII was restored to power and began the [[Absolutist Restoration]], most patriots in South America decided to support [[independence]] instead. 

Some of the most important war leaders of the patriotic movements are called [[Libertadores]] instead. The term "patriot" is used to refer to supporters of the revolution in general, or civil leaders without military activity, such as [[Mariano Moreno]]. The enemies of the patriots, who supported keeping the existing state of things, were called [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Royalists]]. Most patriots were [[Criollo people]]s, whereas most royalists were [[Peninsulares]]; but there were both examples of royalist criollos (such as [[José Manuel de Goyeneche, 1st Count of Guaqui|José Manuel de Goyeneche]]) and patriotic peninsulares (such as [[Domingo Matheu]]).

Like with the case of the contemporary [[Patriot (American Revolution)|North American Patriots]] from the [[American Revolution]], the word "patriot" was not used interchangeably with "[[nationalism|nationalist]]", as it is today. Rather, the concept of [[patriotism]] was linked to enlightenment values concerning a common good, which transcended national and social boundaries. Patriotism, thus, did not require someone to stand behind his country at all costs, and there would not necessarily be a contradiction between being a patriot and revolting against king and country.

The '''political killings in the Philippines''' are a series of [[extrajudicial killings]] and [[enforced disappearances]] of [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] politicians and [[political activist|activists]], [[journalist]]s, [[human rights]] advocates, the political opposition, and outspoken [[clergy]] that have increased dramatically since 2001.

Numerous actors are said to be responsible for these killings which include the [[New People's Army]] and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]]. Left-wing political groups, such as the [[Bagong Alyansang Makabayan]], meanwhile blame the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], the [[Philippine National Police]], the [[Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit]], and government-backed militias. They state that it is part of the official government policy of eradicating the threat from the [[insurgency in the Philippines|insurgency]] of the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] and was officially sanctioned by the [[Presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo|government]] of [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] with the codename of '''Oplan Bantay Laya''' ('''Operation Plan [[Operation Enduring Freedom|Bantay Laya]]''').

These series of events have placed the [[Philippines]] on the human rights watch lists of the [[United Nations]] and the [[United States Congress]]. [[Philip Alston]], the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on extrajudicial killings has criticized the Philippine government for not doing enough to stop the killings, many of which had been linked to government anti-insurgency operations.

==Background==
{{Main|Extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances in the Philippines}}
The political killings in the Philippines, with an estimated death toll of over 1,200 in 2010, began during the administration of [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] in 2001. These include extrajudicial harassment, torture, disappearances and murder of civilian non-combatants by the military and police. The events are thought to be linked to the "[[War on Terrorism]]" in 2001 and includes more than 850 mainstream journalists and other public figures and the harassment, detention, or torture of untold more.&lt;ref name="deadlydirty1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/IB13Ae01.html|title=Deadly dirty work in the Philippines (page 1)|publisher=Asia Times|date=2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators have criticized the killings, such as [[James Petras]] and Robin Eastman-Abaya, who have said  that "Human rights groups provide evidence that death squads operate under the protective umbrella of regional military commands, especially the U.S.-trained [[Special Forces]]".&lt;ref name="petras"&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/petras03172006.html CounterPunch: "America's Best Political Newsletter"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627103440/http://www.counterpunch.org/petras03172006.html |date=2010-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian, [[E. San Juan, Jr.]], meanwhile, writes that the estimates of killings vary on the precise number, with the government estimating only 114. It has failed to gain any convictions, and {{as of|2007|February|lc=y}} had only arrested 3 suspects in the over 100 cases of assassination.&lt;ref name="classstruggl"&gt;[http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/sanjuan180906.html E.

{{quote|Most of those killed or "disappeared" were peasant or worker activists belonging to progressive groups such as [[Bayan Muna]], [[Anakpawis]], [[GABRIELA]], [[BAYAN|Anakbayan]], [[Karapatan]], [[Kilusang Mayo Uno|KMU]], and others (Petras and Abaya 2006).  They were protesting Arroyo's repressive taxation, collusion with foreign capital tied to oil and mining companies that destroy people's livelihood and environment, fraudulent use of public funds, and other anti-people measures.

As a result of the [[2006 state of emergency in the Philippines|state of emergency in 2006]], Presidential Proclamation 1017 was signed by [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], which according to Cher S Jimenez writing in [[Asia Times Online]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;grants exceptional unchecked powers to the executive branch, placing the country in a state of emergency and permitting the police and security forces to conduct warrantless arrests against enemies of the state, including...members of the political opposition and journalists from critical media outlets. With 185 dead, 2006 is so far (2007) the highest annual mark for extrajudicial government murders. Of the 2006 killings, the dead were "mostly left-leaning activists, murdered without trial or punishment for the perpetrators", the issuance of the proclamation conspicuously coincided with a dramatic increase in political violence and extrajudicial killings.&lt;ref name="deadlydirty2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/IB13Ae02.html|title=Deadly dirty work in the Philippines (page 2)|publisher=Asia Times|date=2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Current [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Secretary of Justice]] and former [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Human Rights Commissioner]] [[Leila de Lima]] has stated that she seeks a resolution to the problem.

===Alston Report===
[[Image:Philip Alston by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Philip Alston]], [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] and author of the Alston Report on Extrajudicial Killings in the Philippines.]]

The following are interim recommendations from the Alston Report of [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]]  on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions [[Philip Alston]] published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Alston|Alston, Philip]], [http://www.stopthekillings.org/stknpv2/?q=resources/56 The Alston Report on extrajudicial killings in the Philippines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801004352/http://stopthekillings.org/stknpv2/?q=resources%2F56 |date=2009-08-01 }}. 2007.

# The Government [of the [[Philippines]]] should immediately direct all military officers to cease making public statements linking political or other civil society groups to those engaged in [[Insurgency in the Philippines|armed insurgencies]]. If such characterizations are ever to be made it must be by civilian authorities, on the basis of transparent criteria, and in conformity with the human rights provisions of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]] and relevant treaties;
# The Government should commit to restoring the effectiveness of constitutionally mandated accountability arrangements, especially in relation to the role of Congressional oversight;
# In conjunction with the executive branch of Government, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] should use its constitutional powers over the practice of law to impress upon prosecutors that they have a duty to the public to uphold and protect human rights by acting to ensure the effective investigation of cases and protection of witnesses;
# The Ombudsman's office should begin to take seriously its independent constitutional role in responding to extrajudicial killings plausibly attributed to public officials;
# The Government should provide the Special Rapporteur with a copy of an "order of battle" relating to one of the zones in the country in which significant conflict is currently occurring.

===Melo Commission===
On August 21, 2006, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] created an investigating body headed by former [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Jose Melo]] to probe the extrajudicial and political killings which had targeted militant activists and members of the press.&lt;ref name="inq"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Melo: Commission report 'complete' |last=Alberto |first=Thea |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2007-02-15 |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=49657 |accessdate=2007-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070215100744/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=49657 |archivedate=2007-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The body, popularly known as the Melo Commission, rendered a report which concluded that most of the killings were instigated by the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], but found no proof linking the murder of activists to a "national policy" as claimed by the left-wing groups. On the other hand, the report "linked state security forces to the murder of militants and recommended that military officials, notably retired major general [[Jovito Palparan]], be held liable under the principle of command responsibility for killings in their areas of assignment."&lt;ref name="inq"/&gt;

==Reactions==

The [[government of the Philippines]] has denied any involvement in the killings, and said, in 2007, that a drop by 83% in the number of political killings that year ''"underline the [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo|Arroyo]] government's strong commitment to human rights and its firm resolve to put an end to these unexplained killings and put their perpetrators behind bars."'' This was said to be the result in the creation of a task force was created in 2006 as the government's response to the extrajudicial killings.&lt;ref name="fell"&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080114-112184/PNP-Extrajudicial-killings-fell-by-83-in-2007 | title=PNP: Extrajudicial killings fell by 83% in 2007 | publisher=Inquirer.net | date=2008-01-14 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108100151/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080114-112184/PNP-Extrajudicial-killings-fell-by-83-in-2007 | archivedate=2009-01-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] has publicly condemned political killings "in the harshest possible terms" and urged witnesses to come forward,&lt;ref name="sona2006"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/sona/sonatext2006.asp |title=State of the Nation Address of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo |accessdate=2007-06-05 |date=2006-07-24 |publisher=The Official Website of the Republic of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the sincerity of this condemnation is in doubt due to the continuation of these killings.

The [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], meanwhile, boasts the achievements of the counter-insurgency program stating that the said plan has reduced the number of militants from the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] and the [[New People's Army]] in several [[provinces of the Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/267733/afp-cites-gains-internal-security-plan AFP cites gains of internal security plan].

===Left-wing activists===

Left-wing politicians from the [[Bagong Alyansang Makabayan]], including [[Satur Ocampo]], [[Liza Maza]], [[Teddy Casiño]], [[Rafael V. Mariano]], and [[Luzviminda Ilagan]], has stated in 2010 that the government of [[Benigno Aquino III]] should ''"acknowledge the existence of extrajudicial executions of activists and scrap the operation plan behind these murders"'' and that ''"they are willing to sit down with Aquino to present their concerns and offer solutions if the [[President of the Philippines|President]] wants to"''. They further said that ''"Aquino's vow to uphold human rights should be measured by concrete political and military reforms he is ready to initiate in his government, starting with the scrapping of Oplan Bantay Laya and its criminal component of targeting activists and civilians"''.&lt;ref&gt;Dalangin-Fernandez, Lira.

''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''. 15 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights organizations===
A variety of [[human rights]] organizations have criticized the Philippine government for failing to act against the killings including [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref name = "HRW"&gt;Roth, Kenneth. [https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2010/07/05/president-aquino-needs-tackle-old-problem President Aquino needs to tackle an old problem]. [[Human Rights Watch]]. Published in ''[[The Philippine Star]]''. July 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freedom House]], [[Amnesty International]], the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], and Reporters Without Borders.

[[Reporters Without Borders]] states that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rsf.org/predator-private-militias,37295.html Predators: Private militias - Philippines]. [[Reporters Without Borders]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Police officer]]s, [[soldier]]s, or [[militia]]men have been implicated in most of the hundred or so murders of journalists since [[democracy]] was restored in 1986. Employed by corrupt politicians or hired as [[contract killer]]s, they usually target local radio presenters who have upset the people they are working for. The same modus operandi is nearly always used: two masked men on a [[motorcycle]] gun the journalist down as he is leaving his place of work. For a few thousand dollars, they eliminate the person who has been too outspoken. The cycle of violence has never ended because the culture of impunity is so strong, especially on [[Mindanao]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Amnesty International]] states that ...

{{quote|...the more than 860 confirmed murders are clearly political in nature because of "the methodology of the attacks, including prior death threats and patterns of surveillance by persons reportedly linked to the security forces, the leftist profile of the victims and climate of impunity which, in practice, shields the perpetrators from prosecution." And the arrest and threatened arrest of leftist Congress Representatives and others on charges of rebellion, and intensifying counter-insurgency operations in the context of a declaration by officials in June of 'all-out-war' against the [[New People's Army]] . . . [and] the parallel public labeling by officials of a broad range of legal leftist groups as communist 'front organizations'...has created an environment in which there is heightened concern that further political killings of civilians are likely to take place.|Amnesty International|&lt;ref name="AIreport"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060815205000/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA350062006 Philippines: Political Killings, Human Rights and the Peace '''...'''], Amnesty International&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While [[Human Rights Watch]], in a 2008 report, reported

{{quote |2006 saw a sharp increase in the number of extrajudicial killings, which coincided with President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's June 2006 declaration of an "all-out war" against communist insurgents called the National People's Army (NPA)...the Philippine government is consistently failing in its obligations under international human rights law to hold accountable perpetrators of politically motivated killings....With inconclusive investigations, implausible suspects, and no convictions, impunity prevails....Out of hundreds of killings and "disappearances" over the past five years, there have been only two successfully prosecuted cases resulting in the conviction of four defendants....The number of senior military officers convicted either for direct involvement or under command responsibility remains zero. The doctrine of command responsibility in international law means that superior officers can be held criminally liable for the actions of their subordinates, and also if a superior had reason to know that subordinates under his command committed an offence and failed to use all feasible means under his command to prevent and punish it, he too may be found guilty for the offence.|Human Rights Watch|&lt;ref name=hrwUsig&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/03/10/philip18248_txt.htm Universal Periodic Review of the Philippines (Human Rights Watch, 7-4-2008)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Human Rights Watch]] further writes that the murders and kidnappings are rarely investigated by the police or other government agencies;  they often go unreported because of fears of reprisal against the victims or their families.  The Philippine National Police blame investigative failures on this reluctance, but as Human Rights Watch writes:

{{quote|[W]itnesses are indeed reluctant to cooperate with police investigations, because of fear that they would be targeted by doing so. An extremely weak witness protection program exacerbates this problem....[P]olice are often unwilling to vigorously investigate cases implicating members of the AFP. Families of some victims told Human Rights Watch that when they reported relevant cases to the police, police often demanded that the families themselves produce evidence and witnesses. Even when police filed cases with a court, they often identified the perpetrators either as long-wanted members of the NPA or simply as "John Doe." Some families told Human Rights Watch that police gave up investigating after only a few days.|Human Rights Watch|&lt;ref name="hrwUsig"/&gt;}}

The human rights [[wikt:watchdog|watchdog]], [[Karapatan]], documented 169,530 human rights violations against individuals, 18,515 against families, 71 against communities, and 196 against households. One person is said to be killed every three days during the Arroyo regime or a total of 271 persons {{as of|2003|December|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="hrviol"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.bulatlat.com/news/3-43/3-43-hr.html|journal=Butalot |title=Human Rights Violations in the Philippines: A Grim Reality|publisher=bulatlat.com |volume=III |issue=43 |date=November 30 – December 6, 2003|accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign governments===

====European Union====
The [[European Union]] on laments the lack of court convictions in cases of political killings ... despite a marked decline in the incidents due to international pressure on the government. Alistair MacDonald, ambassador of the [[European Commission]],  said the drop in the number of extrajudicial killings in [ ... 2007] was a welcome development. But he noted that 'it is regrettable that as yet there have been no convictions in relation to the killings of political activists' and the attacks were continuing despite pronouncements by the Philippine government to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130128235850/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1398279.php/EU_laments_no_court_convictions_in_Philippine_political_killings EU laments no court convictions in Philippine political killings].

====United States====
The [[United States]] [[United States State Department|State Department]] report on [[human rights]] has criticized the government of the [[Philippines]] for failing to stop these killings saying that:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eap/136006.htm 2009 Human Rights Report: Philippines ]. The [[United States State Department|State Department]] Report on human rights, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Arbitrary, unlawful, and [[extrajudicial killings]] by elements of the [[military|security services]] and political killings, including killings of [[journalist]]s, by a variety of actors continued to be major problems. Concerns about impunity persisted. Members of the security services committed acts of physical and psychological abuse on suspects and detainees, and there were instances of [[torture]]... Disappearances occurred, and arbitrary or warrantless arrests and detentions were common... [[Left-wing politics|Leftist]] and [[human rights]] activists often were subject to harassment by local security forces.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United States]] [[United States State Department|State Department]] designates the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] as a [[Foreign Terrorist Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm Foreign Terrorist Organization: Redesignation of Communist Party of the Philippines/New People's Army&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205034404/http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm |date=December 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Praja Mandala movement''' was a part of the [[Indian independence movement]] from the 1920s in which people living in the [[princely states]], who were subject to the rule of local aristocrats rather than the [[British Raj]], campaigned against those feudatory rulers, and sometimes also the [[British Raj|British administration]], in attempts to improve their civil rights.

One response to the Praja Mandal agitations was the foundation of the [[Central Reserve Police Force]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nation Keepers: Central Reserve Police Force |first=R. S. D. |last=Dogra |publisher=APH Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=978-8-17648-606-4 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Y6f9HTSq3sUC&amp;pg=PR11 |page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orissa==
When the province of Orissa was created by dividing the existing [[Bihar and Orissa Province]] in 1936, it became the first administrative region of [[British India]] to be defined on a linguistic basis. Although this satisfied some long-standing desires, it made little practical difference to many of the populace because the new province included 26 areas under independent feudal control, called garjats, where the peasantry in particular suffered the effects of misrule and autocratic powers. The remainder of the new province was controlled by the [[British Raj]] authorities.&lt;ref name="parida"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parida|first=Sarat|title=The Praja Mandal Movement and the Birth of Greater Orissa|url=http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2009/Jan/engpdf/17-19.pdf|accessdate=15 September 2016|journal=Orissa Review|date=January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920142035/http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2009/Jan/engpdf/17-19.pdf|archivedate=20 September 2016|pages=17-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the people of Orissa had little involvement in the [[Gandhi]]-inspired [[Salt March]] protests of 1930, that campaign did lead to the First All Orissa States People's Conference being held at [[Cuttack]] in the following year, with [[Bhubanananda Das]] and [[Nakula Samanta Sinhar|Sena Adhaksya Senapati Nakula Samanta Sinhar]] of HindolPrincelyState acting as president. It had the aim of persuading the ruling garjat chiefs to agree to more representative government but achieved nothing more than to increase their repression. A second Conference held in 1937 had more effect. Its aim was to achieve more equitable government and it led to the establishment of Praja Mandals (People's Associations) in most of the garjat states, demanding changes to the feudal system. Their demands included an end to forced labour and illegal taxes, as well as rights relating to freedom of association, publication of newspapers and property.&lt;ref name="parida" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nayagarh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sahoo|first=Arun Kumar|title=Nayagarh and Prajamandal Andolan|url=http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/Apr/engpdf/47-49.pdf|accessdate=15 September 2016|journal=Orissa Review|date=April 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920131443/http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/Apr/engpdf/47-49.pdf|archivedate=2016-09-20|pages=47-49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sign of trouble involving a Praja Mandal arose in the [[princely state]] of [[Nilgiri State|Nilgiri]], where peasant demands for fairer laws resulted in the ruler adopting repressive, even brutal, measures in response. Whilst a temporary truce was eventually achieved, problems then arose also in the states of [[Talcher State|Talcher]] and [[Dhenkanal State|Dhenkanal]]. While the ruler of the latter state took such strong measures that several people were killed, the ruler of Talcher faced an unusual protest that attracted national attention: many of his peasantry moved out of the state to settle in temporary camps in the British-governed area of Orissa.&lt;ref name="parida" /&gt; Another unusual protest occurred in [[Nayagarh State]] when its ruler attempted to introduce a monopoly on the supply of [[betel]]: the population reacted by almost entirely stopping their consumption, which led to the arrest of some of its leaders.&lt;ref name="Nayagarh"/&gt;

Discontent was voiced in other states, such as [[Athgarh State|Athgarh]], [[Baramba State|Baramba]], [[Narsinghpur State|Narsinghpur]], [[Nayagarh State|Nayagarh]], [[Ranpur State|Ranpur]] and [[Tigiria State|Tigiria]], sometimes resulting in violence and death. Following an organised "All Orissa Garjat Day" on 29 October 1938, when people attempted to voice their concerns in unity, the troubles continued into 1939.&lt;ref name="parida" /&gt;

In early January 1939, a British Political Agent, Major Bazelgette, was killed while trying to defuse tensions in Ranpur. The news of this dampened protests elsewhere, and notably so in Nayagarh, where Bazelgette had been summoned a few days earlier to assist the beleaguered raja in calming the Praja Mandal. Whilst the rajas might resort to violence, the [[Indian independence movement]], as exemplified by Gandhi's [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]], believed in non-violent protest and civil disobedience; Congress leaders such as Gandhi, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Subash Chandra Bose]] welcomed the political awakening of the people in Orissa but simultaneously condemned the killing. The British responded to the death by sending in troops, executing the ringleaders, and deposing the raja in favour of direct control.&lt;ref name="Nayagarh"/&gt;

A 1939 report by the Orissa States Enquiry Committee, which had been formed in 1937 to investigate the garjat states, came to nothing because of the outbreak of World War II, during the period of which the British would not countenance any changes or agitation. The Praja Mandal movement came to the fore again when the war ended, spurred by the possibility of wide-ranging change should the British grant India its independence. The first cracks appeared when the ruler of Nilgiri attempted to put a wedge between the tribal and non-tribal communities of his state by fomenting attacks from one on the other. This decision, which he hoped would undermine the Praja Mandal, created a major problem in law and order that made it necessary for the Government of Orissa to intervene on instructions from the central government. The central government were particularly concerned to contain the problem, which had the potential to spread into neighbouring states, and which in part had also been engendered by the unwillingness of the newly-formed [[Eastern States Union]], comprising numerous princely states, to submit to Praja Mandal demands for democratic representation in its governance. Thus, Nilgiri came under the aegis of the provincial government from November 1947 and within weeks all but two of the other garjat states - [[Saraikela State|Saraikela]] and [[Kharsawan State|Kharsawan]] - had agreed to merge with the main Orissa province.&lt;ref name="parida" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Malla"/&gt;

Prominent figures in the Orissa Praja Mandal movement included [[Sarangadhar Das]], [[Baisnab Charan Patnaik]], [[Pabitramohan  Pradhan]], [[Nabakrushna Choudhury]] and [[Kailas Chandra Mahonty]].&lt;ref name="Malla"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/august-2007/engpdf/Page94-100.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714112055/http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/august-2007/engpdf/Page94-100.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-14 |title=Amalgamation of Princely States |first=Bhagyalipi |last=Malla |journal=Orissa Review|date=August 2007 |pages=94-100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic explanation is provided in the British sitcom ''[[Yes Minister]]''.

:Sir Humphrey (the [[Permanent Secretary]]) briefs Hacker (the Minister) on the Department's workings: 
{{quote|
'''Hacker:''' Who else is in this department? &lt;br&gt;
'''Sir Humphrey:''' Well briefly, sir, I am the Permanent Under-Secretary of State, known as the Permanent Secretary. Woolley here is your Principal Private Secretary. I too have a Principal Private Secretary and he is the Principal Private Secretary to the Permanent Secretary. Directly responsible to me are ten Deputy Secretaries, 87 Under Secretaries and 219 Assistant Secretaries. Directly responsible to the Principal Private Secretaries are plain Private Secretaries, and the Prime Minister will be appointing two Parliamentary Under-Secretaries and you will be appointing your own [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]].&lt;br&gt;
'''Hacker:''' Can they all type?&lt;br&gt;
'''Sir Humphrey:''' None of us can type. Mrs MacKay types: she's the secretary.&lt;br&gt;
'''Hacker:''' Pity, we could have opened an agency.&lt;br&gt;

The '''Quartet on the Middle East''' or '''Middle East Quartet''', sometimes called the '''Diplomatic Quartet''' or '''Madrid Quartet''' or simply the '''Quartet''', is a foursome of nations and [[international]] and [[supranational]] entities involved in mediating the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process]]. The Quartet comprises the [[United Nations]], the [[United States]], the [[European Union]], and [[Russia]]. The group was established in [[Madrid]] in 2002, recalling [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], as a result of the escalating conflict in the [[Middle East]]. The Quartet's current Special Envoy is [[Kito de Boer]],&lt;ref name="Boer"&gt;[http://www.quartetrep.org/page.php?id=5df1e6y6156774Y5df1e6 "Welcome to the website of the Office of the Quartet"]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402074707/http://www.quartetrep.org/page.php?id=5df1e6y6156774Y5df1e6 |date=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who assumed the position after the resignation of [[Tony Blair]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="Blair"&gt;{{cite web |author= Josh May |url=https://www.politicshome.com/foreign-and-defence/articles/story/tony-blair-resigns-middle-east-peace-envoy |title=Tony Blair resigns as Middle East peace envoy |website=Politics Home |date=2015-05-27 |accessdate=2015-05-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304194820/https://www.politicshome.com/foreign-and-defence/articles/story/tony-blair-resigns-middle-east-peace-envoy |archivedate=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The initiative to establish the Quartet evolved following the outbreak of the Second Intifada in September 2000 and the futile cease-fire attempts that followed. On October 25, 2001, representatives of the EU, UN and the US and Russian governments met Palestinian leader [[Yasser Arafat]] and jointly expressed support for his policy of implementing cease-fire and security reforms in the Palestinian Authority.&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/fdc5376a7a0587a4852570d000708f4b/fc33d890b2b968a785256af100662c08?OpenDocument Joint statement, October 25, 2001] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003031502/http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/fdc5376a7a0587a4852570d000708f4b/fc33d890b2b968a785256af100662c08?OpenDocument |date=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Israeli incursions into Palestinian areas in April 2002, the representatives of the same four entities met in Madrid and again called for implementation of cease-fire agreements brokered by the US government before. In the same meeting, they also agreed to transform their quadripartite cooperation into a permanent forum for follow-up of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/fdc5376a7a0587a4852570d000708f4b/bfb3858c623f4a8085256b98004da30d?OpenDocument Letter dated 10 April 2002 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003031223/http://unispal.un.org/unispal.nsf/fdc5376a7a0587a4852570d000708f4b/bfb3858c623f4a8085256b98004da30d?OpenDocument |date=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special Envoys ==
[[James Wolfensohn]], the former president of the [[World Bank]], was appointed Special Envoy for [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Israel's disengagement from Gaza]] in April 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Secretary-General Welcoms James Wolfensohn's Appointment by Quartet |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sgsm9820.doc.htm |date=14 April 2005 |publisher=[[United Nations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He stepped down the following year because of restrictions in dealing with the Islamic militant group [[Hamas]] and the withholding of money from the Palestinian Authority, risking its collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article712400.ece |date=3 May 2006 |title=West 'has to prevent collapse' of Palestinian Authority |author=Stephen Farrell |publisher=The Times |accessdate=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tony Blair]] announced that he had accepted the position of the official envoy of the Quartet, the same day he resigned as [[Prime Minister]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and as a [[Member of Parliament]] on 27 June 2007.&lt;ref name="bbc0607"&gt;{{cite news|title=Blair appointed Middle East envoy|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6244358.stm|date=27 June 2007|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approval came after initial objections by Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/875253.html|date=27 June 2007|title=Quartet at loggerheads over scope of authority for Mideast envoy|work=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations were overseeing the finances and security of his mission, before his resignation on 27 May 2015.&lt;ref name="UN_SPV5736_2007"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5736 |date=29 August 2007 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=5736 |accessdate=2007-09-02|speaker=Michael Williams (Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blair" /&gt;

The present special envoy from November 2015 is the Dutch national [[Kito de Boer]].&lt;ref name="Boer" /&gt; 

== Peace efforts and actions ==
Tony Blair periodically travelled to the Middle East following his appointment as Special Envoy. On a trip there in March 2008, he met with Israeli leaders to discuss recent violence. A planned meeting between Israeli and Palestinian businessmen was postponed due to recent fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Herb Keinon, Hilary Leila Krieger, and Tovah Lazaroff, [https://archive.is/20130706010539/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1205261316926&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull "Livni: Israel not expanding settlements"], ''Jerusalem Post'', 3/13/08.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008 Blair announced a new plan for peace and for Palestinian rights, based heavily on the ideas of the [[Peace Valley plan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article3927184.ece Israel may ease grip in Tony Blair deal to revive West Bank] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923203137/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article3927184.ece |date=September 23, 2011}}, The Times May 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In an August 2009 interview, Blair said that he would like to see Hamas and Hezbollah included in peace talks but under the right conditions, that religious leaders should be more involved in the peace process, and that resolving the conflict could be easier than it was in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theholylandreview.net/holyland/att_det.jsp?wi_number=1223&amp;wi_codseq= |title=Terrasanta.net |language=it |publisher=Theholylandreview.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-20 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech given in Israel on August 24, 2010, Blair sharply criticised the campaign of "delegitimization" being carried out by enemies of Israel and proponents of the Palestinians, which refuses to grant Israel its legitimate right to its own point of view and self-defense.  "Don't apply rules to the Government of Israel that you would never dream of applying to your own country," he said.  He characterized such double standards and prejudice as being an "affront to humanity" which "it is a democratic duty to counter."&lt;ref&gt;Tony Blair, "It is a democratic duty to counter delegitimisation of Israel," full text at {{cite web|url=http://www.antidef.org.au/tony-blair-on-delegitimization-of-israel/w1/i1012041/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319054259/http://www.antidef.org.au/tony-blair-on-delegitimization-of-israel/w1/i1012041/ |archivedate=March 19, 2012}} and summarized by Herb Keinon in the ''Jerusalem Post'' of Aug. 25, 2010, "Delegitimization of Israel is affront to humanity," at http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=185860.{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and shortcomings ==
Despite the significance officially attached to the Quartet's part in promoting the peace process, many of its statements are merely repetition of previous statements and no significant changes in policy by either the Israeli government or the Palestinian Authority have occurred resulting from a Quartet meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercury-fp7.net/fileadmin/user_upload/E-paper_no9_r2011.pdf Nathalie Tocci, The EU, the Middle East Quartet and (In)effective Multilateralism]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quartet has been fiercely criticized for its ineffectiveness. When Tony Blair held the function of Quartet representative, in December 2012, Palestinian officials said that "Tony Blair shouldn't take it personally, but he should pack up his desk at the Office of the Quartet Representative in Jerusalem and go home. They said his job, and the body he represents, are ′useless, useless, useless′".&lt;ref name=independent_useless&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/useless-useless-useless-the-palestinian-verdict-on-tony-blairs-job-8421163.html ''′Useless, useless, useless′: the Palestinian verdict on Tony Blair's job''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161127073302/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/useless-useless-useless-the-palestinian-verdict-on-tony-blairs-job-8421163.html |date=November 27, 2016 }}. Matthew Kalman, The Independent, 16 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Center for Middle East Policy]] said in February 2012 that "The Quartet has little to show for its decade-long involvement in the peace process. ... Having spent most of the last three years in a state of near paralysis, and having failed to dissuade the Palestinians from seeking UN membership and recognition in September 2011, the Quartet has finally reached the limits of its utility. ... The current mechanism is too outdated, dysfunctional, and discredited to be reformed. Instead of undertaking another vain attempt to 'reactivate' the Quartet, the United States, the European Union, United Nations, and Russia should simply allow the existing mechanism to go quietly into the night,".&lt;ref name=independent_useless /&gt;

The '''Rawalpindi Conspiracy''' (also known as the '''Rawalpindi Conspiracy Case''') was an attempted ''coup d'état'' against the government of [[Liaquat Ali Khan]], the first [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], in 1951. The conspiracy was the first of [[Military coups in Pakistan|many subsequent coup attempts]] against elected governments in the history of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="E"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rawalpindi conspiracy case|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Opinions/Columns/27-Aug-2009/Rawalpindi-conspiracy-case|publisher=The Nation|date=27 August 2009|accessdate=17 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828024544/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Opinions/Columns/27-Aug-2009/Rawalpindi-conspiracy-case|archivedate=28 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coup was planned by [[Major-General]] [[Akbar Khan (Pakistan)|Akbar Khan]], a senior commander in the [[Pakistani army]], in conjunction with other military officers and left-wing Pakistani politicians.&lt;ref name="E"/&gt;

==Causes==
Main causes of Rawaplindi conspiracy case (busted on 9 March 1951) were three. One, a general discontent of Army's Pakistani Officers with the performance of the [[Liaquat Ali Khan|Liaqat Ali Khan]]'s Government, whom they thought of as corrupt and incompetent. Two, many of the high ranking Pakistani Generals viewed the continuing presence of British Army Officers in the army as a security threat, as well as an impediment to their speedy promotions. Third, and most immediate cause was their discontent with Liaqat regime's handling of the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|Kashmir war with India]] (1948). Army officers thought Government's acceptance of [[UN mediation of Kashmir|UN mediation]] and ceasefire, as a 'tame surrender' and 'flouting an opportunity to capture whole of [[Kashmir]]'. It is to be noted that several Pakistan Army officers who had fought the Kashmir war, were ethnic Kashmiris and owned land in the contested province. Maj. General [[Akbar Khan (Pakistani general)|Akbar Khan]] (who was the master mind behind the Rawalpindi Conspiracy) had communist leanings, which explains why he enlisted the support of communist/leftists intellectuals of Pakistan. e.g. [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz|Faiz Ahmed Faiz]] and [[Sajjad Zaheer|Syed Sajjad Zaheer]] (Secretary General of Pakistan Communist Party). Whether USSR was actively involved in this conspiracy is not supported by any evidence. This conspiracy had no connection with Pakistan's joining [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|SEATO]] or [[CENTO]], as both these international bodies came into being much later (in 1954 and 1955, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;'Hasan Zaheer (1998). The times and trial of the Rawalpindi conspiracy 1951: the first coup attempt in Pakistan. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-577892-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
Eleven military officers and four civilians were involved in the conspiracy.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kashmir in the shadow of war: regional rivalries in a nuclear age|author=Robert Wirsing|pages=173–75|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7656-1089-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main person responsible for planning the coup was Maj. Gen. Akbar Khan, the chief of general staff of the Pakistani army.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; During the 1947 war, Khan had led Pakistani forces under the pseudonym of "General Tariq."&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; He was based in the northern city of [[Rawalpindi]], where the army headquarters were located, while the political capital of the state was in the southern city of [[Karachi]] at the time. The civilian conspirators included leading Pakistani poet [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]], who was notably active in left-wing politics and sympathetic to the [[Communist Party of Pakistan]], and [[Sajjad Zaheer]].&lt;ref name="E"/&gt; Akbar Khan's wife, Naseem Shahnawaz Khan, was also believed to have motivated her husband to undertake this plot.&lt;ref name="E"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Lucky Pilot: Memoirs of Retired Wing Commander Lanky Ahmad|author=S.M.

==Exposure and trial==
The conspiracy was foiled after the government was informed of the coup attempt by one of the confidantes of Akbar Khan.&lt;ref name="E2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rawalpindi conspiracy case|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Opinions/Columns/27-Aug-2009/Rawalpindi-conspiracy-case/1|publisher=The Nation|date=27 August 2009|accessdate=17 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712111332/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Opinions/Columns/27-Aug-2009/Rawalpindi-conspiracy-case/1|archivedate=12 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government forces immediately arrested Maj. Gen. Akbar Khan and the other conspirators, including Faiz Ahmed Faiz. The army commander-in-chief, Gen. [[Muhammad Ayub Khan]] and the defence secretary Maj. Gen. [[Iskander Mirza]] had both remained loyal to the government. Ayub Khan immediately ordered the army troops to surround and take control of the army headquarters, where Maj. Gen. Akbar Khan was based. Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan announced the foiling of the coup on 9 March 1951. The government passed the Rawalpindi Conspiracy (Special Tribunal) Act to set up a special tribunal to investigate the conspiracy.&lt;ref name="C"/&gt; A trial was held for the 15 individuals accused, namely – Maj. Gen. Akbar Khan, Air Commodore M. K. Janjua, Maj. Gen. Nazir Ahmed, Brigadier Sadiq Khan, Brigadier M. A. Latif Khan, Lt. Col. Zia-ud-Din, Lt. Col. Niaz Muhammad Arbab, Captain Khizar Hayat, Maj. Hassan Khan, Major Ishaq Muhammad, Captain Zafrullah Poshni, Mrs. Naseem Akbar Khan, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, [[Syed Sajjad Zaheer]] and Muhammad Hussain Ata.&lt;ref name="E"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C"/&gt;&lt;ref name="E2"/&gt;

After an 18-month trial conducted in secrecy, Maj. Gen. Khan and Faiz Ahmed Faiz were both convicted and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.&lt;ref name="E2"/&gt; Their defence lawyer was the notable [[Bengali people|Bengali]] Muslim politician [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]].&lt;ref name="D"/&gt;&lt;ref name="E2"/&gt; When Suhrawardy became the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 1957, he obtained a reprieve for most of the conspirators.&lt;ref name="D"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
Major General Akbar Khan was soon rehabilitated in Pakistani political life, becoming an adviser to Pakistani politician [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]. Upon coming to power in 1971, Bhutto appointed Akbar Khan as the chief of national security.&lt;ref name="D"/&gt; Faiz continued to publish many works of poetry, and was appointed to the National Council for Arts by the Bhutto government. Gen. Ayub Khan launched the first successful military coup against the government of President [[Iskander Mirza]] in 1958, assuming the reins of the presidency himself until 1969. [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] was assassinated later in 1951, in October, in an unrelated attack by an Afghan in Rawalpindi.

'''''Report about Case Srebrenica (the first part)''''' was a controversial official report on the July 1995 [[Srebrenica massacre]] in eastern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It was prepared by Darko Trifunović&lt;ref name="Rozajać"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rozajać|first=Sanita|title=Europe Finds Interesting Trifunovic's Story about Islamic Terrorism|work=Oslobodjenje|publisher=via BBC Monitoring|date=16 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hayat"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bosnian Muslims object to Serb terrorism expert addressing European conference|work=TV Hayat|publisher=via BBC Monitoring|date=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief Record|url=http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;BBID=15401773&amp;v3=1|publisher=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published by the [[Republika Srpska]] Government Bureau for Relations with the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY).

The report denied that there had been a massacre at [[Srebrenica]] and accused the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] of having "fabricated" its findings on the killings. Its claims were strongly criticised by the international community and the [[Bosniak]]s and were eventually disowned by the Republika Srpska government.&lt;ref name="Denial"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Tracy, Jen|author2=Rawles, Lee|author3=Krauthamer, Ky|author4=Gardner, Andrew|title=The Death of Denial|url=http://www.tol.org/client/article/10948-the-death-of-denial.html|work=Transitions Online|date=10 November 2003|accessdate=3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a judgment against [[Miroslav Deronjić]], the Hague Tribunal judges described the report as "one of the worst examples of revisionism."&lt;ref name="ICTY=Deronjic"/&gt; No "second part" has ever been published.

==Background==
In July 1995, forces of the [[Army of the Republika Srpska]] (VRS) captured the town of [[Srebrenica]] in eastern [[Bosnia]], which had been cut off and surrounded despite the presence of soldiers from the [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR). Thousands of refugees had crowded into the town to escape the Serb advance. Following the Serb takeover of Srebrenica, an estimated 8,000 Bosniak men and boys were systematically massacred by Serb forces between 11–15 July and another 25,000–30,000 were subjected to [[ethnic cleansing]]. It was the largest act of [[mass murder]] in Europe since [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Briefly Noted|url=http://iwpr.net/report-news/briefly-noted-67|publisher=Institute of War and Peace Reporting|date=18 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successive governments of [[Republika Srpska]] (and, for a while, [[Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]) sought to deny the massacre and other [[war crimes]] committed by the VRS during the war.&lt;ref name="Denial" /&gt; It was against this background that, as the former [[United Nations]] trial attorney Mark B. Harmon commented, "the campaign of misinformation and deceit reached its apotheosis seven years after the crimes were committed with the publication of the ''Report About Case Srebrenica (the first part)''."&lt;ref name="Harmon"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Harmon, Mark B.|author2=Gaynor, Fergal|title=Ordinary Sentences for Extraordinary Crimes|url=http://jicj.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/3/683.full?ck=nck|issue=5|year=2007|pages=683–712|journal=Journal of International Criminal Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents of the report==
[[File:Darko Trifunović.jpg|left|thumb|Darko Trifunović, the author of ''Report about Case Srebrenica'', whose work on the report was strongly criticised.]]
The report was promoted as an effort "to present the whole truth about crimes committed in Srebrenica region regardless nationality of perpetrators of crimes and time when they were committed {{sic}}."&lt;ref name="Harmon" /&gt; It asserted that no more than 2,000 [[Bosniaks]] (Bosnian Muslims) had died at Srebrenica – all armed soldiers, not civilians – and that 1,600 of them had died in combat or while trying to escape the enclave.&lt;ref name="Imaginary"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Alić, Anes|author2=Stanimirović, Dragan|title=Imaginary Massacres?|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,349957,00.html|newspaper=Time|date=11 September 2002|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consistently referred to the "alleged massacre", attributed the deaths of about 100 Bosniaks to "exhaustion" and concluded: "the number of Muslim soldiers who were executed by Bosnian Serb forces for personal revenge or for simple ignorance of international law […] would probably stand less than 100."&lt;ref name="ICTY=Deronjic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prosecutor v. Miroslav Deronjić – Sentencing Judgement|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/deronjic/tjug/en/sj-040330e.pdf|publisher=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|date=30 March 2004|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report dismissed as "mentally disturbed" a Bosnian Serb soldier who had admitted participating in the killings, and claimed that the survivors' stories were a product of their imaginations: "To walk for almost 20 days in an area that might be full of landmines, without any food and water, under the fear of being shot from any direction was such a trauma that soldiers sometimes mixed reality with illusions. Having looked at dead bodies under such psychological [pressure], some Muslim soldiers could have believed what they imagined."&lt;ref name="Imaginary"/&gt; It asserted that "this combat might have looked like a mass killing in the eyes of frightened Muslim soldiers, although they carried weapons and shot at Bosnian Serb soldiers randomly."&lt;ref name="Subotic"&gt;{{cite news|last=Subotic|first=Tanja|title=Bosnian Serbs seek to minimize Srebrenica killings|publisher=Agence France-Presse|date=3 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also asserted that the findings of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and other humanitarian organisations had been "manipulated" and "fabricated".&lt;ref name="Denial" /&gt; It characterised Serbs as the victims of Bosniak war crimes around Srebrenica,&lt;ref name="Fischer"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fischer|author2=McDonald, Avril|title=Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law – 2002|pages=453–454|publisher=Asser Press|year=2005|ISBN=90-6704-189-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserting that in 1992 and 1993 alone 1300 Serb civilians were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dragnich |first=Alex |date=Autumn–Winter 2002 |title=Srebrenica: No Definitive Verdict Yet|journal=The South Slav Journal |issue=89/90 |pages=23–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure has been shown to be inaccurate, and the true number "three to nine times smaller", by the [[Research and Documentation Center in Sarajevo]], a non-partisan institution with a multi-ethnic staff, whose data have been collected, processed, checked, compared and evaluated by an international team of experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mit o Bratuncu: Sramotna Manipulacija Brojevima |trans-title=Myth of Bratunac: Shameful Manipulation of Numbers |publisher=Research and Documentation Center in Sarajevo |url=http://www.idc.org.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=259:bratunac&amp;catid=115:ljudski-gubici-ostalo&amp;Itemid=147&amp;lang=bs |date=7 June 2010 |language=Serbo-Croatian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623234049/http://www.idc.org.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=259:bratunac&amp;catid=115:ljudski-gubici-ostalo&amp;Itemid=147&amp;lang=bs |archivedate=June 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The instigator of the massacre, General [[Ratko Mladić]], was mentioned only in the context of demanding the surrender of the town and evacuating civilians; the report asserted that he had tried "discouraging Serbs to take their wild revenge."&lt;ref name="Subotic" /&gt; The report claimed that "the Muslims inflated the number [of deaths] in order to accomplish what they wanted from the very beginning – to involve the international community in the conflict with Serbs."&lt;ref name="Newsline040902"&gt;{{cite news|title=Newsline – September 4, 2002|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1142751.html|date=4 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dejan Miletić, whom [[Paddy Ashdown]], the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, removed in April 2004 from his post as Head of the Republika Srpska Secretariat for Relations with the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia|International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague]] and Research of War Crimes, the report "had based its conclusions on publications found on the Internet, reports from the United Nations and other sources." It was intended to be sent to lawyers defending Bosnian Serbs on trial for war crimes.&lt;ref name="Subotic" /&gt;

==ICTY verdict==
The ICTY reviewed the "Report About Case Srebrenica" and concluded the following:

{{quote|The Trial Chamber admitted into evidence a document which represents one of the worst examples of revisionism in relation to the mass executions of Bosnian Muslims committed in Srebrenica in July 1995. This document, titled “Report about Case Srebrenica (the First Part)” was prepared by the Documentation Centre of Republika Srpska, Bureau of Government of Republika Srpska for Relation with ICTY on 1 September 2002. Throughout this report reference is made to the “alleged massacre” and this misrepresentation of the historical events culminates in the final conclusion of this report, which reads: […] the number of Muslim soldiers who were executed by Bosnian Serb forces for personal revenge or for simple ignorance of international law […] would probably stand less than 100.&lt;ref name="ICTY=Deronjic"/&gt;

After the report was published on 3 September 2002, it was condemned by a wide variety of Bosnian and international figures.&lt;ref name="IWPR-Bosnian Serbs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Katana|first=Gordana|title=Bosnian Serbs Play Down Srebrenica|url=http://iwpr.net/report-news/regional-report-bosnian-serbs-play-down-srebrenica|publisher=Institute of War and Peace Reporting|date=30 April 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130221155015/http://iwpr.net/report-news/regional-report-bosnian-serbs-play-down-srebrenica|archivedate=21 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the ICTY told [[Radio Free Europe]] that "any claim that the number of victims after the fall of the Srebrenica enclave was around the 2,000 mark, and most of those killed in battle, is an absolutely outrageous claim. It's utterly false, and it flies in the face of all of the evidence painstakingly collected in the investigation into the tragedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bosnia: New Bosnian Serb Report Denies Srebrenica Massacre|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1100678.html|date=3 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the effort to minimise the number of victims as "frankly, disgusting."&lt;ref name="Newsline030902"&gt;{{cite news|title=Newsline – September 3, 2002|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1142750.html|date=3 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Balkan Report: September 6, 2002|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1341079.html|date=6 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carla del Ponte]], the chief prosecutor of the ICTY, described the report's authors as "totally blind, profoundly insensitive and clearly willing to obstruct all efforts to find reconciliation, truth and justice."&lt;ref name="SETimes-Srebrenica" /&gt; Del Ponte's legal adviser, Jean-Jacques Joris, criticised the report as "a saddening example of revisionism and an element which certainly stands in the way of reconciliation in the region."&lt;ref name="Newsline030902" /&gt; The ICTY prosecutors subsequently used the report as evidence in the trial in 2004 of [[Miroslav Deronjić]]; in their verdict, the judges called it "one of the worst examples of revisionism in relation to [the massacre]".&lt;ref name="ICTY=Deronjic" /&gt;

[[Paddy Ashdown]], the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]], condemned it as "tendentious, preposterous and inflammatory"&lt;ref name="IWPR-Bosnian Serbs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International Officials Denounce Bosnian Serb Srebrenica Report – 2002-09-04|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-a-2002-09-04-24-international-67580632/288499.html|newspaper=Voice of America|date=4 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "so far from the truth as to be almost not worth dignifying with a response."&lt;ref name="SETimes-Srebrenica"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Srebrenica Report Condemned|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/mk/features/setimes/features/2002/09/020904-SVETLA-001|publisher=SETimes.com|date=4 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High Representative condemns Srebrenica report|url=http://www.ohr.int/print/?content_id=27845|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805084821/http://www.ohr.int/print/?content_id=27845|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 August 2012|newspaper=Office of the High Representative|date=3 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; His office issued a statement calling the report "an irresponsible attempt to deceive voters and to abuse the trauma of massacre survivors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High Representative's office condemns Serb report on Srebrenica|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9985215_ITM|publisher=SRNA (via BBC Monitoring)|date=3 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashdown's spokesman, Julian Braithwaite, noted the report's publication just before elections in the Republika Srpska: "The question for the RS government is why are they publishing this report now, at the time when it could be easily interpreted as irresponsible electioneering. If they are playing down the fact that civilians were massacred and that children are being exhumed from mass graves with their hands tied behind their backs, then that it is outrageous."&lt;ref name="Subotic" /&gt; The [[European Union]] issued a statement calling on "all responsible people and institutions" to reject the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=(Un)Civil Societies Report: September 11, 2002|url=http://fb.rferl.org/content/article/1347280.html|newspaper=Radio Free Europe/Radio Libert|date=11 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Commission on Missing Persons]] issued a strongly worded statement calling the report a gross distortion of the facts:

{{quote|Manipulation of the issue of the missing for political purposes, including the manipulation of numbers of missing, has been an ongoing practice within Bosnia and Herzegovina that only serves to cause further pain and suffering in a society that has already suffered so much. The study regarding the numbers of missing from the 1995 fall of Srebrenica made by the Republika Srpska's Government Bureau for Relations with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) contains what ICMP believes to be serious inaccuracies.&lt;ref name="Imaginary" /&gt;}}

The British [[Foreign Office]] minister [[Denis MacShane]] condemned the report as "an insult to the memory of those who died. The authors of this report belong in the same category as those who [[Holocaust denial|deny the Holocaust took place]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MacShane condemns report denying Srebrenica massacre|url=http://www.wired-gov.net/wg/wg-news-1.nsf/0/1B1424FA443840E1802572AB004B6458?OpenDocument|publisher=Foreign and Commonwealth Office|date=4 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States]] embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina urged the Republika Srpska government to withdraw the report, calling it "an attempt to manipulate and divide the public in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OHR BiH Media Round-up, 6/9/2002|url=http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/presso/bh-media-rep/round-ups/print/?content_id=27870|publisher=Office of the High Representative|date=6 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosnian media, political parties and Srebrenica survivors were likewise strongly critical. The [[Sarajevo]]-based newspaper ''[[Dnevni Avaz]]'' described the report as an attempt by the Bosnian Serb government to deny that [[genocide]] had taken place. The Srebrenica and Zepa Mothers Association condemned the report as "false,  shameful and utterly amoral."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OHR BiH Media Round-up, 5/9/2002|publisher=Office of the High Representative|url=http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/presso/bh-media-rep/round-ups/print/?content_id=27864|date=5 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] denounced it as "yet another attempt by the Serb Republic authorities in an unscrupulous and brutal way to negate what probably is the worst crime in Europe after WW2."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bosnian party says Serb report on Srebrenica "unscrupulous and brutal"|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10021477_ITM|publisher=SRNA (via BBC Monitoring)|date=3 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OHR BiH 4/9/2002"&gt;{{cite web|title=OHR BiH Media Round-up, 4/9/2002|url=http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/presso/bh-media-rep/round-ups/print/?content_id=27853|publisher=Office of the High Representative|date=4 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alija Behmen]], the Prime Minister of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], called it "a surprising forgery which is trying to delude the public and especially the Serbs in BiH. I honestly believe that this is the last attempt to enliven the policy which marked the tragic past of BiH. Negating the genocide cannot be a part of the election campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bosnian Serb Srebrenica report draws "howls of outrage" from massacre survivors|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-26007382_ITM|publisher=Onasa news agency (via BBC Monitoring)|date=5 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Bosnian Serb side, opinions of the report were initially favourable. The Bosnian Serb media largely supported the report,&lt;ref name="Imaginary" /&gt; and Republika Srpska president [[Mirko Šarović]] (who in October 2002 became the Serb member of the collective [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|presidency]]) said that the report "should not be dismissed out of hand but merits careful study".&lt;ref name="Newsline050902"&gt;{{cite news|title=Newsline – September 5, 2002|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|url=http://fb.rferl.org/content/article/1142752.html|date=5 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Bosnian Serb political figures made public statements denying that war crimes had happened&lt;ref name="Imaginary" /&gt; and a government spokesman called the report a bid to promote "truth and reconciliation".&lt;ref name="Newsline040902" /&gt; The Republika Srpska Socialist Party leader, Lazar Ristić, welcomed the report and accused the Bosniak side of having "hitherto presented only false reports, in which names were listed of persons who are still alive today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bosnian Serb Socialist Party official hails government report on Srebrenica|publisher=SRNA (via BBC Monitoring)|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25984696_ITM|date=6 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikola Špirić]], the speaker of the [[National Assembly of Republika Srpska]], called it "the worst election campaigning I have ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sito-Sutic|first=Daria|title=Bosnian Serbs face dilemma over Srebrenica denial|date=5 September 2002|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milorad Dodik]], who was later to become prime minister of Republika Srpska, castigated the report as having been "written by an amateur for the purpose of manipulating public opinion" in advance of the elections and said:

{{quote|It is a political gaffe of the government, since one can see that the report was written several years ago by one man. The report had been written in 1996 and 1997, which goes to show that it does not mention the report by the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation. [...] The government shouldn't have allowed itself to draft such a superficial, amateurish report which put Republika Srpska into such a difficult situation. Responsibility for the consequences of the report's publication must be borne by those who produced it in such a superficial and amateurish way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bosnian Serb party leader says Srebrenica report is political gaffe|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9985586_ITM|publisher=FoNet news agency, Belgrade (via BBC Monitoring)|date=6 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Republika Srpska government was, however, more equivocal. Its prime minister, [[Mladen Ivanić]], accused the media in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Federation entity]] of having "made [a] fuss over the report for their own purposes."&lt;ref name="Imaginary" /&gt; Nonetheless, the outcry from the international community forced the government of Republika Srpska to distance itself from the report, saying that it had not been fully analysed and endorsed:&lt;ref name="IWPR-Bosnian Serbs" /&gt;

{{quote|The two studies, which the RS Government's Bureau for Cooperation with the ICTY compiled, are not made by the RS Government. They are part of the report that the RS Government’s Bureau for Cooperation with the ICTY submits to the RS Government every three months. The fact that the Srebrenica report had been condemned by the [[Office of the High Representative]] before the Bureau's news conference was held comes as a surprise. The Bureau representatives clearly said at the news conference that the both reports are to  be submitted to the RS Government, which tells us that the OHR based its condemnation on news reports from the BiH Federation media, which said that the  Bureau reports are RS Government's report. It also comes as a surprise the fact  that the OHR representatives commented on a document, which they have not read.  This is another confirmation that the OHR gives in to the pressures coming from the Sarajevo media and that the OHR creates its views by using their [the Sarajevo media's] information and press releases, thus bringing its own [the OHR's] impartiality in question.&lt;ref name="OHR BiH 4/9/2002"/&gt;}}

The Republika Srpska government subsequently disowned the report with Prime Minister Ivanić saying that it was an "unfinished version"&lt;ref name="Denial" /&gt; and "not an attitude of the government of Republika Srpska."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bosnian Serb PM distances himself from controversial massacre report|publisher=Agence France-Presse|date=9 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, after further pressure from the international community, the Bosnian Serb government issued an official apology for the massacre and admitted that "enormous crimes" had been "committed in the area of Srebrenica in July 1995."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bosnian Serbs issue apology for massacre|url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1147&amp;reportid=166|publisher=Associated Press|date=11 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Singing Revolution''' is a commonly used name for events between 1987 and 1991 that led to the restoration of the independence of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | last=Thomson | first=Clare | title=The Singing Revolution: A Political Journey through the Baltic States | location=London  | publisher=Joseph | year=1992 | isbn=0-7181-3459-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ginkel | first=John |date=September 2002 | title=Identity Construction in Latvia's "Singing Revolution": Why inter-ethnic conflict failed to occur | journal=Nationalities Papers | volume=30| issue=3| pages=403–433 | doi=10.1080/0090599022000011697}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by an Estonian activist and artist, [[Heinz Valk]], in an article published a week after the 10–11 June 1988, spontaneous mass evening singing demonstrations at the [[Tallinn Song Festival Grounds]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nI73PdnqQlcC&amp;pg Between Utopia and Disillusionment By Henri Vogt; p 26] {{ISBN|1-57181-895-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Baltic states under Soviet rule}}
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
After [[World War II]], the [[Baltic states]] had been fully incorporated into the [[USSR]] after [[military occupation]] and [[annexation]] first [[Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)|in 1940]] and then [[Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1944)|again in 1944]]. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced "''[[glasnost]]''" (openness) and "''[[perestroika]]''" (restructuring) in 1985, hoping to stimulate the failing Soviet economy and encourage productivity, particularly in the areas of consumer goods, the liberalisation of cooperative businesses and the service economy. Glasnost rescinded limitations on [[Freedom (political)|political freedoms]] in the Soviet Union which led to problems within the non-Russian nations occupied in the build-up to war in the 1940s.

Hitherto unrecognised issues previously kept secret by the Moscow government were admitted to in public, causing dissatisfaction within the Baltic states. Combined with the [[Soviet–Afghan War|war in Afghanistan]] and the nuclear fallout in [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]], grievances were aired in a publicly explosive and politically decisive manner. Estonians were concerned about the [[demographic threat]] to their national identity posed by the influx of individuals from foreign ethnic groups to work on such large Soviet development projects as phosphate mining.&lt;ref&gt;''Estonia and the Estonians'',  Toivo U. Raun,  Hoover Press, 2001, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to Western émigré communities abroad and, particularly in Estonia, informal relations with [[Finland]] and access to Finnish TV showing the Western lifestyle also contributed to widespread dissatisfaction with the Soviet system and provoked mass demonstrations as repression on dissidents, nationalists, religious communities and ordinary consumers eased substantially towards the end of the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Massive demonstrations against the Soviet regime began after widespread liberalisation of the regime failed to take into account national sensitivities. It was hoped by [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Moscow]] that the non-Russian nations would remain within the USSR despite the removal of restrictions on freedom of speech and national icons (such as the local pre-1940 flags).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, the situation deteriorated to such an extent that by 1989 there were campaigns aimed at freeing the nations from the Soviet Union altogether.

==Estonia==
The [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]]'s plan to excavate [[phosphorite]] in the [[Lääne-Viru County]] with potentially catastrophic consequences for the environment and the society was revealed in February 1987. That started the [[Phosphorite War]] public environmental campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estonica.org/en/Phosphorite_War/ Phosphorite War] Estonica. Ecyclopaedia about Estonia&lt;/ref&gt; The [[MRP-AEG]] group held the [[Hirvepark meeting]] in the [[Vanalinn|Old Town]] of Tallinn at the anniversary of [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] on 23 August 1987, demanding to [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact#Aftermath|disclose and condemn]] its [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact#The secret protocol|secret protocol]].

The "Five Patriotic Songs" series by [[Alo Mattiisen]] premiered at the [[Tartu]] Pop Festival in May 1988.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.estonica.org/en/The_Singing_Revolution/|title=Estonica.org - The Singing Revolution|website=www.estonica.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June the Old Town Festival was held in Tallinn, and after the official part of the festival, the participants moved to [[The Tallinn Song Festival Grounds|the Song Festival Grounds]] and started to sing patriotic songs together spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.onthisdeity.com/10th-june-1988-%E2%80%93%C2%A0the-singing-revolution/|title=10th June 1988 – the Singing Revolution|work=Dorian Cope presents On This Deity|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baltic Way]], a [[human chain]] of two million people spanned from Tallinn to [[Vilnius]] on 23 August 1989.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/estonias-singing-revolution-1986-1991/|title=Estonia's Singing Revolution (1986-1991) {{!}} ICNC|date=2016-02-25|work=ICNC|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mattiisen's "Five Patriotic Songs" were performed again at the Rock Summer festival in Tallinn held on 26–28 August 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rocksummer.ee/en/history/1988-|title=1988 – Rock Summer I - Rock Summer|website=www.rocksummer.ee|language=en|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Song of Estonia]] festival was held at the Song Festival Grounds on 11 September.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Trivimi Velliste]], Chairman of the Estonian Heritage Society first voiced the public ambition to regain independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Estonica.org - Song of Estonia|url = http://www.estonica.org/en/Song_of_Estonia/|website = www.estonica.org|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Soviet of Estonia issued the [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration]] on 16 November.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Singing Revolution lasted over four years, with various protests and acts of defiance. In 1991, as Soviet tanks attempted to stop the progress towards independence, the [[Estonian Supreme Soviet election, 1990|Supreme Soviet of Estonia]] together with the [[Congress of Estonia]] proclaimed the restoration of the independent [[Sovereign state|state]] of Estonia and repudiated Soviet legislation. People acted as human shields to protect radio and TV stations from the Soviet tanks. Through these actions Estonia regained its independence without any bloodshed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stateofworldliberty.org/report/results.html State of World Liberty ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930180917/http://www.stateofworldliberty.org/report/results.html |date=2010-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence was declared on the late evening of 20 August 1991, after an agreement between different political parties was reached. The next morning Soviet troops, according to Estonian TV, attempted to storm [[Tallinn TV Tower]] but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etv.ee/index.php?0536408 History of ETV (in Estonian)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214015907/http://www.etv.ee/index.php?0536408 |date=2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Communist hardliners' [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|coup attempt]] failed amidst mass pro-democracy demonstrations in Moscow led by [[Boris Yeltsin]].

On 22 August 1991, [[Iceland]] became the first nation to recognise the newly restored independence of Estonia. Today, a plaque commemorating this event is situated on the outside wall of the Foreign Ministry, which itself is situated on Islandi väljak 1, or "Iceland Square 1". The plaque reads; "The Republic of [[Iceland]] was the first to recognise, on 22 August 1991, the restoration of the independence of the Republic of Estonia", in [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[English language|English]].

==Latvia==
During the second half of the 1980s as [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]] in the [[USSR]], which rolled back restrictions to freedom in the Soviet Union, aversion to the Soviet regime had grown into the third [[Latvian National Awakening]], which reached its peak in mid-1988.

In 1986, it became widely known to the public that the USSR was planning to build another [[hydroelectric power plant]] on Latvia's largest river [[Daugava River|Daugava]], and that a decision had been made to build a [[Riga Metro|metro]] in [[Riga]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Both of these projects planned by Moscow could have led to the destruction of Latvia's landscape and cultural and historical heritage. In the press journalists urged the public to protest against these decisions. The public reacted immediately, and in response the [[Environmental Protection Club]] was founded on 28 February 1987. During the second half of the 1980s the Environmental Protection Club became one of the most influential mass movements in the region and began to make demands for the restoration of Latvia's independence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

On 14 June 1987, the anniversary of the [[June deportation|1941 deportations]], the human rights group "[[Helsinki-86]]", which had been founded a year earlier, organised people to place flowers at the [[Freedom Monument (Riga)|Freedom Monument]] (Latvia's symbol of independence, which was erected in 1935). This is widely cited as the beginning of the National Awakening. However the [[Latvian Song and Dance Festival]] of 1985 also had been sometimes named for choirs requesting and performing the song ''Gaismas pils'' conducted by Haralds Mednis after the main event. The song, which speaks about the rebirth of a free Latvian nation, usually a staple of the festival, had been removed from the repertoire and the conductor, disliked by Soviet authorities, sidelined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kulturaskanons.lv/en/1/7/92/|title=JĀZEPS VĪTOLS'S "GAISMAS PILS": a ballad for mixed choir|work=Latvian Cultural Canon|accessdate=28 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318070536/http://www.kulturaskanons.lv/en/1/7/92/|archivedate=18 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 and 2 June 1988, the Writers' Union held a congress during which the democratisation of society, Latvia's economic sovereignty, the cessation of immigration from the USSR, the transformation of industry and the protection of Latvian language rights were discussed by delegates. Over the course of this conference, for the first time in post-war Latvia, the secret protocol of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which had determined Latvia's fate after 1939, was publicly acknowledged.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The congress of the Writers' Union stirred up public opinion and provided an additional stimulus for the general process of [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In the summer of 1988, two of the most important organisations of the revival period began to assemble themselves—the [[Latvian People's Front]] and the [[Latvian National Independence Movement]] (LNIM). Soon afterwards the more radically inclined [[Citizens' Congress of the Republic of Latvia|Citizens' Congress]] called for complete non-compliance with the representatives of the Soviet regime.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} All of these organisations had a common goal: the restoration of democracy and independence. On 7 October 1988, there was a mass public demonstration, calling for Latvia's independence and the establishment of regular judicial order. On 8 and 9 October the first congress of the Latvian People's Front was held. This organisation, which attracted 200,000 members, became the main representative of the return to independence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

On 23 August 1989, the fiftieth anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the People's Fronts of all three Baltic countries held a huge demonstration of unity—the "[[Baltic Way]]". A {{convert|600|km|0|abbr=on}} long human "chain" from Tallinn through Riga to [[Vilnius]] was assembled. This was a symbolic demonstration of the people's call for independence from the Soviet Union.

New elections to the [[Supreme Soviet]] took place on 18 March 1990, in which the supporters of independence gained a victory. On 4 May 1990, the new Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR adopted a motion, "[[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|Declaration of Independence]]", which called for the restoration of the inter-war Latvian state and the 1922 Constitution.

In January 1991, however, pro-communist political forces attempted to restore Soviet power. With the use of force, attempts were made to overthrow the new assembly. Latvian demonstrators managed to stop the Soviet troops from re-occupying strategic positions, and these events are known as the "[[January 1991 events in Latvia|Days of the Barricades]]".

On 19 August 1991, an unsuccessful attempt at a [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|coup d'état]] took place in Moscow when a small group of prominent Soviet functionaries failed to regain power due to large pro-democracy demonstrations in Russia. This event resulted in Latvia swiftly moving toward independence. After the coup's failure the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian Republic announced on 21 August 1991, that the transition period to full independence declared on 4 May 1990 had come to an end. Therefore, Latvia was proclaimed a fully independent nation whose judicial foundation stemmed back to the statehood that existed before the occupation on 17 June 1940.

==Lithuania==
[[File:1990 01 12 GorbačiovasŠiauliuose10.jpg|thumb|Lithuanian people in [[Šiauliai]] (Gorbachev visit, 1990)]]
[[File:UkmPaminkl.JPG|thumb|[[Ukmergė]]'s monument of independence, "Lituania Restituta", restored in 1989.]]
Thousands of people regularly gathered in public places across Lithuania and sang [[national song]]s and [[Roman Catholic]] [[hymn]]s. The popularity of patriotic songs had risen significantly during this period.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Many popular singers had followed this trend, often using the poetry of nationalist poets, such as [[Bernardas Brazdžionis]] or [[Justinas Marcinkevičius]] as the lyrics of their songs. [[Roko Maršas|Rock March]] also promoted awareness of the issue among the people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

On 3 June 1988, the [[Sąjūdis]], a political and social movement to lead the independence and pro-democracy movement, was established.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The active nationalist opposition towards the regime culminated in the return of [[Vilnius Cathedral]], formerly used as a museum of fine arts, to the Catholic community on 21 October 1988,  followed by the gradual restoration of national symbols, which included the erection or restoration of independence monuments throughout the country. The [[Tautiška giesmė|national anthem of Lithuania]] and the traditional national [[Flag of Lithuania|Tricolore]] were legalised in Lithuania on 18 November 1988, officially replacing the [[flag of Lithuanian SSR|flag]] and the [[anthem of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Five decades after Lithuania was occupied and incorporated into the Soviet Union, Lithuania became the first republic to [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|declare its independence]] from the USSR on 11 March 1990, and was later followed by Latvia and Estonia. However, almost all nations in the international community, except [[Iceland]], hesitated to recognise independence for Lithuania until August 1991.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The Soviet military responded harshly. On 13 January 1991, fourteen non-violent protesters in Vilnius died and hundreds were injured defending the [[Vilnius Television Tower]] and the [[Seimas|Parliament]] from Soviet assault troops and tanks. Lithuanians referred to the event as [[January Events#January 13|Bloody Sunday]]. The discipline and courage of its citizens—linking arms and singing in the face of tanks and armour-piercing bullets—avoided a much greater loss of life and showed the world that Lithuania's citizens were prepared to defend national independence.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The international governments recognised Lithuanian independence after the failure of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|coup d'état]] in August 1991.

The '''social construction of the body''' is a hypothesis that affirms that the relationship between the body and the [[Sociocultural context|socio-cultural context]] occurs in both senses, and that society and culture influence the formation of its members to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;Guerra Carrasco, René (2005). "Donación de órganos: compresión y significado.". Universidad de Chile (20).&lt;/ref&gt; The body has become a social construction, in whose delimitation have participated multiple disciplines. Thus, [[medicine]] and [[religion]] can be mentioned as the agents that have traditionally influenced, together with the rules of urbanity and educational institutions. These four agents have been building a model, which every individual has as reference. According to [[Bryan Turner (sociologist)|Bryan S. Turner]], the social construction of the body is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/951272599|title=The body &amp; society : explorations in social theory|last=S.|first=Turner, Bryan|publisher=Sage|isbn=1412929873|oclc=951272599}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"The nearest and immediate feature of my social self, a necessary feature of my social situation and my personal identity, and at the same time an aspect of my personal alienation in the natural environment"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They provide supplies and furniture and help residents turn on electricity and water. Though the occupations are of contested legality, {{Asof|2008|December |lc=on}} local police officers were not intervening, judging it to be the responsibility of house owners to protect their property or request assistance.&lt;ref name=sfgate/&gt;

== Advocacy ==

The group advocates for changes in governmental housing policy.&lt;ref name="cityPaper"/&gt; Max Rameau, the homeless advocate running the program, called it "morally indefensible to have vacant homes sitting there, potentially for years, while you have human beings on the street".&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;  Rameau says that the group only moves families into government- or bank-owned properties, and argues that it is not fair for the banks to be receiving government [[bailout]]s while keeping these assets.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=CNN news|date=December 6, 2008|title= Interview with Max Rameau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tactics ==

Rameau states that having people occupy the buildings helps the owners by preventing looting and property destruction that he says would likely happen to unoccupied buildings.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apmsn"/&gt;  He also says that the group requires that tenants get electricity and provides solar panels if the electricity does not work.&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;  Take Back the Land activists help maintain and clean the yards of the [[squatting|squatted]] houses, and they give the families cleaning supplies and furniture.&lt;ref name="apmsn"&gt;{{cite news|date=December 1, 2008|title=Activist moves homeless into foreclosures: Man executes bailout plan of his own on Miami's empty streets |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28002276/|accessdate=April 2, 2009|publisher= msnbc.msn.com|author=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group gains access to unoccupied houses, paints and cleans them, changes the locks, and connects electricity and water.&lt;ref name="MotherJones"&gt;{{cite web|author=Tristram Korten|title=Foreclosure Nation: Squatters or Pioneers?|date=May–June 2008 |publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=April 2, 2009|url = https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2008/05/foreclosure-nation-squatters-or-pioneers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rameau says each occupation costs the group $200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = With Advocates’ Help, Squatters Call Foreclosures Home | publisher=New York Times|author = [[John Leland (journalist)|John Leland]]| accessdate = April 2, 2009|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/10/us/10squatter.html?_r=2&amp;hp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Take Back the Land instructs tenants of the houses to occupy the houses openly; they enter and leave through the front door, pay for utilities in their own names, and are honest with neighbors.&lt;ref name="MiamiNews"/&gt;  The families live in the houses they occupy until they either save up enough money to afford to pay for housing or are forcibly evicted by police.&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;

The group maintains a waiting list of families who would like to move into foreclosed homes.&lt;ref name="MotherJones"/&gt;  Rameau says tenants are carefully chosen in order to avoid creating crack houses; drug addicts are rejected, and participants are assessed for their "urgency of need".&lt;ref name="MiamiNews"/&gt;

According to Rameau, he had approached banks in 2008 with the idea of buying them for a discount price and renting them to homeless people; they seemed interested at first but he says they stopped calling him back after the [[Troubled Assets Relief Program|2008 federal bailout]] was announced.&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;

&lt;!--Illegality
--&gt;Take Back the Land uses illegal tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Homeless find shelter in foreclosed homes |url= http://www.justnews.com/video/18149053/index.html |publisher= justnews.com |author= Channel 10 News |accessdate= April 2, 2009 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090324015112/http://www.justnews.com/video/18149053/index.html |archivedate= March 24, 2009 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group commits trespassing&lt;ref name="ch10"&gt;{{cite news|title=Family Refuses To Leave Foreclosed Home|date= February 23, 2009| url=http://www.justnews.com/news/18779255/detail.html#video |publisher=justnews.com |accessdate=April 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tenants could be charged with crimes such as vandalism.&lt;ref name="apmsn"/&gt; Rameau says, "there's a disconnect between the need and the law.  Being arrested is just one of the potential factors in doing this."&lt;ref name="apmsn"/&gt; The tenants are told that they may be arrested if caught.&lt;ref name="MotherJones"/&gt; Take Back the Land has a pro-bono lawyer on standby.&lt;ref name="MotherJones"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marketplace"&gt;{{cite news|title=Miami's homeless inhabit vacant homes|url=http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/01/28/pm_foreclosure_squatters/|date=January 28, 2009|publisher=NPR Marketplace.

== Background ==
{{see also|Umoja Village}}

Take Back the Land was originally formed in 2006 as an anti-[[gentrification]] organization&lt;ref name="cityPaper"/&gt; inspired by the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] in [[Brazil]] and the [[Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://takebacktheland.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99:take-back-the-land-in-south-africa&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=60 Take Back the Land in South Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; The group built the [[Umoja Village]] in Miami in 2006, a shantytown on an undeveloped lot in support of the "black community's right to own land".&lt;ref name="MiamiNews"/&gt;  Fifty homeless people lived in the village.&lt;ref name="cityPaper"/&gt; After the village burned down in April 2007, the group moved 14 of the ex-residents into a warehouse.&lt;ref name="MiamiNews"/&gt;  Max Rameau released a book detailing the experience entitled ''Take Back the Land: Land, Gentrification and the Umoja Village Shantytown''.&lt;ref&gt;''Take Back the Land: Land, Gentrification and the Umoja Village Shantytown''. {{ISBN|1-4348-4556-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly due to [[overbuilding]] and [[speculation]], Florida, and particularly Miami, have been affected by the housing crisis in the [[late 2000s recession]].&lt;ref name=sfgate/&gt;  In September 2008, Florida had the second highest rate of foreclosures in the country.&lt;ref name=sfgate/&gt;

Take Back the Land moved the first family into an unoccupied house on October 22, 2007.&lt;ref name="MiamiNews"/&gt;  By November 2008, it had opened up six houses,&lt;ref name="MiamiNews"/&gt; and by April 2009, the group had moved 20 families into foreclosed homes.&lt;ref name="GoodMorn"/&gt;

The '''Professor Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize''' (''Raftoprisen'') is a [[human rights]] award established in the memory of the [[Norway|Norwegian]] human rights activist, [[Thorolf Rafto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Raftostiftelsen|title=Raftoprisen|author=Vibeke Blaker Strand|publisher=Store norske leksikon|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Thorolf_Rafto ''Thorolf Rafto''] Store norske leksikon&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The prize is awarded annually by the [[Rafto Foundation for Human Rights]] (''Raftostiftelsen'') which was founded in the humanistic tradition of the [[Helsinki Accords]] in order to promote the fundamental human rights of intellectual and political freedom. Today, the foundation is based at the Human Rights House in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]]. The major work of the foundation, including the organization of the award ceremony is done by a small team of professional staff and volunteers. The award ceremony takes place at [[Den Nationale Scene]] in Bergen annually in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Raftostiftelsen|title=  Raftostiftelsen|publisher=  Store norske leksikon|author=  Jon Gunnar Arntzen
|accessdate= November  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial idea of the Rafto Prize was to provide a basic informative platform for the laureates that would help to receive further attention from the international media and support from political and non-political organisations. By awarding the Rafto Prize, the Rafto Foundation for Human Rights seeks to bring attention to independent voices that due to oppressive and corruptive regimes are not always heard. For example, four Rafto Laureates have subsequently received further international assistance and were awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], [[José Ramos-Horta]], [[Kim Dae-jung]] and [[Shirin Ebadi]] were awarded the Rafto Prize prior to the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://humanrightshouse.org/Articles/5242.html|title=  Rafto Foundation|publisher= Human Rights House Foundation|accessdate= November  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Thorolf Rafto]] was a professor of [[Economic History]] at the [[Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration]] (NHH). He was also well known for his political activism in [[Eastern Europe]], especially in [[Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]].  During a visit to [[Prague]] in 1979 to hold a lecture for students excluded from universities for political reasons. Rafto was arrested and beaten by the communist security police which may have resulted in injuries which weakened his health. On 4 November 1986 Thorolf Rafto died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Thorolf_Rafto/utdypning|title=Thorolf Rafto|author=Arnljot Strømme Svendsen|  publisher=Norsk biografisk leksikon|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His friends and colleagues agreed to establish a foundation that would continue Rafto's work such as promotion of freedom of speech and political expression in [[Eastern Europe]].  It was also decided to introduce a prize for human right activists. [[revolutions of 1989|The fall of the Iron Curtain]] and consequential democratization of Eastern European states led to a reconsideration the mission of the foundation. Meanwhile it had opened new possibilities to work with other geographical regions in a promotion of human rights. Already in 1990, the Rafto Prize was awarded to a [[Burma|Burmese]] democratic leader, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] who, in the following year 1991, received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights.  For the first years, the foundation was based at the [[Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration]]. From 1997, the Rafto Foundation was relocated to the [[Human Rights House of Bergen]], Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Ceremony==
The Rafto Prize is awarded annually on the first Sunday in November and since 1990, the official ceremony takes place at the [[Den Nationale Scene|National Theatre of Bergen]]. Among the invited guests are representatives from Bergen municipality and the Norwegian government, academics, supporters and partners of the Rafto Foundation and family members of the Rafto family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://maritime-executive.com/features/the-rafto-legacy |title=  The Rafto Legacy|publisher=  The Maritime Executive |accessdate= November  1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria and nomination process==
The annual deadline for nominations is 1 April. Voluntary organisations, institutions and individuals worldwide, with knowledge or interest in human rights are allowed to nominate candidates for the Rafto Prize. Former recipients of the prize can also nominate candidates, although candidates who are nominated by themselves or by their staff or by honorary officers will not be taken into consideration. After the deadline, all applications are carefully considered by the prize committee and the final decision is usually released at the press conference at Rafto House in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafto.org/?page=38|title=Home - Raftostiftelsen|publisher=|accessdate=21 September 2015}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Voter turnout in Canada]] is lowest for [[young voters]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stolle | first1 = Dietlind | last2 = Hooghe | first2 = Marc | author-link1 = Dietlind Stolle | author-link2 = Marc Hooghe | title = The roots of social capital: attitudinal and network mechanisms in the relation between youth and adult indicators of social capital | journal = [[Acta Politica]] | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 422–441 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | doi = 10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500081 | date = December 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500081 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A general decline in electoral participation among the under-35 population has been observed in many democratic countries around the world, especially in Canada. "The youngest age cohort did experience a bump upwards in estimated voter turnout from 37% in the 2004 federal general election to 43.8% for the election that followed, before descending to 37.4% for the 2008 federal general election."&lt;ref&gt;[Alfred, Taiaiake., Pitawanakwat, Brook., and Price, Jackie. "The Meaning of Political Participation for Indigenous Youth: Charting the Course for Youth Civic and Political Participation." ''Canadian Policy Research Networks''. Jun 2007. Web. 25 Nov 2011. &lt; www.cprn.ca/documents/48503_EN.pdf&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Participation in provincial elections for youth aged 18 to 24 was 28% in 2001.  However, in the 2005 provincial election, the turnout in this age group increased to 35%.&lt;ref&gt;[Barnes, Andre. "Youth Voter Turnout in Canada: 1 Trends and Issues." Library of Parliament. 7 Apr 2010. Web. 11 Nov 2011. &lt;http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/ResearchPublications/2010-19-e.htm&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidently, low voter turnout of young Canadians has generated a great deal of concern.

"Detailed analyses of electoral participation since the 1968 federal election indicate that much of the decline has been driven by generational replacement."&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, the differences in electoral participation across age groups can be seen as a generation gap phenomenon.  "The rate of voter participation declines steadily as one moves from the oldest to the youngest age cohorts." &lt;ref&gt;[Pammett, Jon H.. LeDuc, Lawrence. "Explaining the Turnout Decline in Canadian Federal Elections: A New Survey of Non-voters." ''Elections Canada''. Mar 2003. Web. Oct 2011 &lt;www.elections.ca&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The study by Jon H. Pammett and Lawrence LeDuc employed by [[Elections Canada]] reveals just how large the gap between the youngest and oldest voters has become.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt;  One explanation for this phenomenon is that one's age can affect one's view as to the relevance of the issues that typically dominate the political agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[Gidengil, Elizabeth. , Blais, Andre. , Everitt, Joanna., Fournier, Patrick., and Nevitte, Neil. "Missing the Message Young Adults and the Election Issues." ''Elections Canada''. Web. 18 Nov 2011.  &lt;http://www.elections.ca/res/eim/article_search/article.asp?id=122&amp;lang=e&amp;frmPageSize=&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend analysis demonstrates that the generation gap applies to specific political issues. "Views on school integration proved the exception to the rule, an exception that is explicable in terms of massive period effects and possibly life-cycle effects operating on the young."&lt;ref&gt;[Jennings, M. Kent, and Niemi, Richard G. ''Generations and Politics: A Panel Study of Young Adults and Their Parents.'' New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1981. Pg. 161.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proportion of Canadians under 15 years of age dropped from 32.5% in 1941 to 17.6% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[Heard, Andrew. "Historical Voter Turnout in Canada Federal Elections &amp; Referenda, 1867-2008." ''Elections''. Web. 04 Nov. 2011. &lt;https://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/elections/historical-turnout.html&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a statistical milestone was reached, in which the proportion of Canadians over 64 (5.78 million) topped the proportion of those under 15 (5.75 million),[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/09/29/more-canadians-over-64-than-under-15-statscan-reports.html as reported by the Star.]

Younger Canadians tend to be less interested in politics: Only one in 20 Canadians between 18 and 30 years of age (in 2000) had ever belonged to a political party, compared with one-third of those over age 60.&lt;ref&gt;[ Mackinnon, Mary Pat. , Pitre, Sonia. , and Watling Judy. [http://www.cprn.ca/documents/48800_FR.pdf "Lost in Translation: (Mis) Understanding Youth Engagement: Synthesis Report."] ''Canadian Policy Research Networks''. Oct 2007. Web. 26 Nov 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; There is concern whether a failure to engage younger Canadians early will have a detrimental effect on our democracy over time. "There is no question that over the past two decades, we have seen youth voting rates declining at a precipitous rate to the point where clear majorities of the younger generations don't vote and may well never do so."&lt;ref&gt;[Graves, Frank. "The Looming Legitimacy Crisis: Time to Take the Discretionary out of Democracy?" ''Ekos Politics''. 21 Oct 2011. Web. 22 Nov 2011. &lt; http://www.ekospolitics.com/index.php/2011/10/the-looming-legitimacy-crisis-october-21-2011/&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Young voter turnout factors  ==

We might wonder why the youth are not very interested in more traditional types of political participation. Stephen P. Nicholson uses Ricker's suggestion that the outcome of a vote may depend on the agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[Nicholson, Stephen P. Voting The Agenda: Candidates, Elections, And Ballot 
Propositions. Princeton; Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;  What type of agenda settings are shaping young Canadians? What is the trend in youth civic and political engagement in Canada? To what degree do political activities influence young Canadian voters? How do social differences influence the structure of society? An analysis of basic theoretical reasons behind the low voter turnout of young Canadians was done based on quantitative and qualitative research.  The analysis reported some factors that contributed to the unwillingness of youth to vote and to participate in democracy: 1. Social Factors, different implications of youth values from older generation.&lt;ref&gt;[Mackinnon, Mary Pat. , Pitre, Sonia. , and Watling Judy. "Lost in Translation: (Mis) Understanding Youth Engagement: Synthesis Report." Canadian Policy Research Networks. Oct 2007. Web. 26 Nov 2011. &lt; www.cprn.ca/documents/48800_FR.pdf&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 2. Institutional Factor, differences in Political discourses.  It will highlight demographic trends in Canada and have created this new fixation on age as a major determinant of political participation and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;[MacManus, Susan A. Young Vs. Old: Generational Combat in the 21st Century.Colorado; Oxford: Westview Press, Inc., A Division of HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 1996. P. 4.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, what is the role of newspaper to engage with the young voters?  There is no particular reason to attribute low voter turnout to any one factor, though some factors may be more important than others.&lt;ref&gt;[Pammett, Jon. H., and LeDuc, Lawrence. "Explaining the Turnout Decline in Canadian Federal Elections: A New Survey of Non-voters." Elections Canada. Carleton; Toronto: Mar 2003. Web. 14 Oct 2011. &lt;www.elections.ca&gt; P. 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The assessment of political activity==
[[File:YouthVoteInCanada poster KensingtonMarket October2015.jpg|thumb|Poster in a shop window in Kensington Market, Toronto, October 2015, during the federal election campaign. It contains the words of political commentator of Rick Mercer.]]Canadian electoral participants attribute "turnout decline to negative public attitudes toward the performance of the politicians and political institutions involved in federal politics."&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid. P. 7 ]&lt;/ref&gt; "When it came to the question of asking whether politics is a way for the powerful to themselves or, instead, a way for the less powerful to compete on equal footing, more respondents in both countries chose the cynical view." &lt;ref&gt;[Milner, Henry. "Political Knowledge and Participation Among Young Canadians and Americans" Institute for Research on Public Policy. Nov 2007. Web. 11 Nov 2011. &lt; www.irpp.org/wp/archive/wp2007-01.pdf&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A survey done across the nation shows a clear plurality: 49% disapprove of the way [[Stephen Harper]], Prime Minister and leader of Conservative Party of Canada, is handling his job compared to [[Barack Obama]], President of The United States, whose disapproval rate is 12%.&lt;ref&gt;["Election Anyone?: Speaker's Ruling May Not Tempt Any Party To Force An Election." ''Ekos Politics''. 29 Apr 2010. Web. 04 Nov 2011. P. 13 &lt;http://www.ekospolitics.com/index.php/2010/04/election-anyone-april-29-2010/ &gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since voting is evidently central to citizens' politics in representative democracies, it is unsurprising that young participants' attitudes to politics were partly shaped by their perceptions of their position in relation to this most basic of political citizenship rights. Indeed, Synthesis Report by Canadian Policy Research Networks reports that youths do not tend to connect the role of government with the issues they think are important.&lt;ref&gt;[Mackinnon, Mary Pat. , Pitre, Sonia. , and Watling Judy. "Lost in Translation: (Mis) Understanding Youth Engagement: Synthesis Report." ''Canadian Policy Research Networks''. Oct 2007. Web. 26 Nov 2011. &lt; www.cprn.ca/documents/48800_FR.pdf&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The changing style of political discourse ===
 
There are roughly four times as many votes registered by seniors than by younger voters. This effect is compounded by dramatic differences in political preferences with seniors being more than twice as likely to favour conservative choices than younger voters. "In a decade or two, the younger voters will be in the prime of their lives and paying for the political choices of their now departed grandparents which are not likely to reflect the priorities or, one could speculate, the needs of next Canada."&lt;ref&gt;[Graves, Frank. "The Looming Legitimacy Crisis: Time to Take the Discretionary out of Democracy?" ''Ekos Politics''. 21 Oct 2011. Web. 22 Nov 2011. P.2. &lt; http://www.ekospolitics.com/index.php/2011/10/the-looming-legitimacy-crisis-october-21-2011/&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, this phenomenon is age-related, as there are variations in the personal relevance of the issues that typically dominate the political discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[ Gidengil, Elizabeth. , Blais, Andre. , Everitt, Joanna., Fournier, Patrick., and Nevitte, Neil. "Missing the Message Young Adults and the Election Issues." ''Elections Canada''. Web. 18 Nov 2011. &lt;http://www.elections.ca/res/eim/article_search/article.asp?id=122&amp;lang=e&amp;frmPageSize=&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Disengagement from the political agenda setting becomes significant as the age of our population rises, but their relative clout has been dramatically magnified by the declining voting rates of younger citizens. The commentary on youth disengagement suggests that "young Canadians are turned off by electoral politics because party platforms and party leaders pay too little attention to the issues that really concerned younger citizens."&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid. P.3.]&lt;/ref&gt; Nanos Research conducted a survey for individuals aged 18 years or older between August 13 and September 30, 2011, to question, "What is your most important PROVINCIAL issue of concern?" And the research data identifies they mostly concern the health 26.4% from February 2010, 23.2%.&lt;ref&gt;[Nano, John. "What is your most important PROVINCIAL issue of concern?" ''Nanos Research''. 01 Oct 2011. Web. 05 Oct 2011. &lt;http://www.nanosresearch.com/library/opinion.html&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; And only 16% of those named job/economy as their second most important.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt; The number one issue for young Canadians was health. Another survey was conducted by Elections Canada to pinpoint the most important issue in the election and Canadians aged 18 to over 60 were asked to select the issue that was most important to them personally.&lt;ref&gt;[Gidengil, Elizabeth. , Blais, Andre. , Everitt, Joanna., Fournier, Patrick., and Nevitte, Neil. "Missing the Message Young Adults and the Election Issues." ''Elections Canada''. Web. 18 Nov 2011. P.3. &lt;http://www.elections.ca/res/eim/article_search/article.asp?id=122&amp;lang=e&amp;frmPageSize=&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the common issues was health. Indeed, a striking finding from the survey data is how similar the priorities of Canadians are, regardless of their age. Evidently, [[Ekos Politics]] constructed a survey in October 2010 that asked which party you would vote for if a federal election were held tomorrow. The result of Ontario vote intention was [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] Party 36.0% and Liberal 34.2% second.&lt;ref&gt;[Election Anyone?: Speaker's Ruling May Not Tempt Any Party To Force An Election." ''Ekos Politics''. 29 Apr 2010. Web. 04 Nov 2011. P. 9. &lt;http://www.ekospolitics.com/index.php/2010/04/election-anyone-april-29-2010/ &gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a year later, the new data justified an adjustment in Ontario 2011 Election from PC 34.0% to [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] 38.6% since the 2010 elections.&lt;ref&gt;["EKOS' Final Poll For The 2011 Ontario Election: …And A Few Comment On Why This Isn't Our Most Important Poll."

According to ''Ekos Politics'', they predicted, "a Liberal majority government, though we observed a last-minute shift to the Progressive Conservative Party, and cautioned that the final outcome was far from certain."&lt;ref&gt;["A Brief Post Mortem on Polling During the Ontario 2011 Election." ''Ekos Politics''. 07 Oct 2011.

"Willing to participate: Political engagement of young adults." ''Statistics Canada.'' 2005. Web. 28 Oct 2011. P. 3. &lt; www.statcan.gc.ca/kits-trousses/pdf/social/edu04_0155a-eng.pdf&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political knowledge and trust ===

"Political knowledge is a democratic value. It is also an important ingredient in democratic citizenship, influencing public attitudes and opinions and, thus political behaviour."&lt;ref&gt;Milner, Henry.[http://www.irpp.org/wp/archive/wp2007-01.pdf "Political Knowledge and Participation Among Young Canadians and Americans"], [[Institute for Research on Public Policy]]. Nov 2007. Web. 11 Nov 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Young Canadians display a pattern of civic and political engagement that differentiates them from other aged groups. According to Henry Milner, the political knowledge centralizes to the young voter decline.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid]&lt;/ref&gt; Brenda O'Neil supports Milner's analysis by saying, "counterintuitively, cynicism toward government and the political system is generally lower among young Canadians than among older ones, and have greater confidence in party leaders and candidates than older generations.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neil, Brenda. [http://www.cprn.ca/documents/48800_FR.pdf "Indifferent or Just Different? The Political and Civic Engagement of Young People in Canada: Charting the Course for Youth Civic and Political Participation."], ''[[Canadian Policy Research Networks]]''. Jun 2007. Web. 31 Oct 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Milner and O'Neil argue young voter participants have a strong engagement towards the effects on political knowledge. "Voters' lack of political information raises important concerns about contemporary democratic practices."&lt;ref name=WhoLearns&gt;Nadeau, Richard., Nevitte, Neil., Gidengil, Elisabeth., and Blais, Andre.[http://ces-eec.org/pdf/UPCP_A_319893_O.pdf ''"Election Campaigns as Information Campaigns: Who Learns What and Does it Matter?"''], [[Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group]]. Web. 10 Nov 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A non-voting or alternative activity "can be a valuable source of political education [which develops] politically relevant knowledge, awareness, understanding and skills."&lt;ref&gt;Milan, Anne. [http://www.statcan.gc.ca/kits-trousses/pdf/social/edu04_0155a-eng.pdf "Willing to participate: Political engagement of young adults."] ''[[Statistics Canada]]''. 2005. Web. 28 Oct 2011. P. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This opens to investigate links with communication insights and the knowledge gap. "First, respondents' knowledge of candidates' and parties' issue positions are key indicators of information gains registered during the course of a campaign."&lt;ref name=WhoLearns/&gt; The role of Civic education class is a unique source to inform political parties and government. Taking an education class foreground the young Canadians to engage on an array of important public issues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jennings, M. Kent]]. , and Niemi, Richard G. "Generations and Politics: A Panel Study of Young Adults and Their Parents." New Jersey: [[Princeton University Press]], 1981. Pg. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of political party defines as '"the psychological feeling of attachment of a political party." The authors of the Sourcebook made it clear that party identification "is to be distinguished from such behavior as party registration for primary elections or voting for candidates of a particular party."&lt;ref&gt;MacManus, Susan A. ''Young Vs. Old: Generational Combat in the 21st Century''. Colorado; Oxford: Westview Press, Inc., A Division of [[HarperCollins]] Publishers, Inc., 1996. P. 67&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in Ontario in 2000 began to educate civic education to inform political backgrounds.

==Values of young Canadians ==
Accordingly, ''Policy Horizons Canada'' presents today's young people's interest and statistics of priority in regards to their lives. "Today's young people continue to place a high value on family and work and do not reject the political system in which they live, nor do they demonstrate a massive lack of interest in politics."&lt;ref&gt;["The Values of Youth in Canada." Policy Horizons Canada. 27 Mar 2010. Web. 24 Nov 2011. &lt; http://www.horizons.gc.ca/eng/content/investing-youth&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They add, "census research indicates that youths consider education to be of the utmost importance in opening doors for future employment and assisting them to integrate into society." 
&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt; What are the common values shared between young Canadians? It should be different from the values 10 or 30 or 50 years ago. Why is there a disconnection between youth and today's social institutions? Why do youth values demonstrate a divergence from those of the parents' generation? That is because of "the context of increasing globalization, diversity, and urbanization, and major transformations affecting the family and the labour market."&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiculturalism===
"Community involvement connected to political engagement."&lt;ref&gt;[Milan, Anne. "Willing to participate: Political engagement of young adults." Statistics Canada. 2005. Web. 28 Oct 2011. P. 4. &lt; www.statcan.gc.ca/kits-trousses/pdf/social/edu04_0155a-eng.pdf&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly, Canadian society is structured based on shared values of family, education, work, the democratic system as well as bilingualism and multiculturalism.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, young adults have differences in values due to educational differences.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to educational differences, the globalization in Canada has had a significant effect as well.  Globalization traces with trade and cultural exchanges, which expanded to experience international adaptability and web engines to explore differences.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt;  "These trends may potentially have an impact on what is valued by youth, such as bilingualism (and even multilingualism) multiculturalism."&lt;ref name="horizons.gc.ca"&gt;["The Values of Youth in Canada." Policy Horizons Canada. 27 Mar 2010. Web. 24 Nov 2011. &lt; http://www.horizons.gc.ca/page.asp?pagenm=2010-0016_02&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps, immigrants' population presents the possibility of changes in youth values as well. In terms of immigrants' population, Citizenship and Immigration Canada categorizes permanent immigrants in Canada by using statistical tables and charts. "Three basic categories of permanent residents, which correspond to major program objectives: reuniting families, contributing to economic development and protecting refugees.&lt;ref&gt;["Canada Facts And Figures: Immigration Overview Permanent and Temporary Residents." Citizenship and Immigration Canada. 2010. Web. 20 Oct 2011.&lt; http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/menu-fact.asp&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Such number of ethnic groups was verified by the statistics of Canada. And age and source areas&lt;ref&gt;[Source areas are divided into Africa and the Middle East, Asia and Pacific, South and Central America, United States, Europe and the United Kingdom.]&lt;/ref&gt; are categorized to permanent young immigrant residents.Statistically, a top rated ethnic group aged from 15 to 24 years was Asian young immigrants, 65,817 and Africa and the Middle East, 33,239 in second.&lt;ref&gt;["Canada Facts And Figures: Immigration Overview Permanent and Temporary Residents." ''Citizenship and Immigration Canada''. 2010. Web. 20 Oct 2011. P. 30.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, economic immigrants, aged from 15 to 24 years are Asians, the highest, 62,825 among all aged groups from 0 to 65 years of age or more.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid. P. 23.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on the statistics of young immigrants explain the value of multiculturalism is prominent in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[Karim, Karim H. "Press, Public sphere, and pluralism: multiculturalism debates in Canadian English-language newspapers." Canadian Ethnic Studies Journal. 2008. Web. 25 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb039/is_1_40/ai_n32432794/&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  "Since urbanization and ethnic diversification in Canadian society result in exposure to different cultures, they many also affect youth values." &lt;ref name="horizons.gc.ca"/&gt; The result of multiethnic immigrants centralizes multicultural society.

===Status and socialization===
'''"Nearly 7 in 10 university-educated young adults participate in non-voting political behaviour."'''&lt;ref&gt;[Milan, Anne. "Willing to participate: Political engagement of young adults." ''Statistics Canada''. 2005. Web. 28 Oct 2011. P. 4. &lt; www.statcan.gc.ca/kits-trousses/pdf/social/edu04_0155a-eng.pdf&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The other profile of youth value is constructed by status and socialization.  As young generation socializes most of the time, it gradually constructs a self-identity.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Policy Horizons Canada'' states "the values of 14 to 19 year old, has formulated a theory that values are first structured at the beginning of adolescence, when there is an initial distancing from the family home, then a second period where the development of values is affected by educational success."&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, self-identity shapes in transition to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;[Clark, Warren. "Canadian Social Trends." ''Statistics Canada''. 02 Jan 2009. Web. 24 Nov 2011. &lt;http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-008-x/2007004/10311-eng.htm&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of adulthood, young adults' value shift based on experience, a discrepancy between their values and those of society's institutions.&lt;ref&gt;["The Values of Youth in Canada." ''Policy Horizons Canada''. 27 Mar 2010. Web. 24 Nov 2011. &lt; http://www.horizons.gc.ca/page.asp?pagenm=2010-0016_02&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Today's young adults are incentives for social and economic factors. CLC President Ken Geogetti was commenting in regards to the latest release from Statistics Canada of its Labour Force Survey for September 2011 that "Too many of our young workers are unemployed, too many of them are stuck in part-time jobs and Ottawa should be paying particular attention to them." &lt;ref&gt;["Younger workers being left behind: CLC President comments on job numbers for September 2011." Canadian Labour Congress. 07 Oct 2011. Web. 25 Nov 2011. &lt;http://www.canadianlabour.ca/national/news/younger-workers-being-left-behind-clc-president-comments-job-numbers-september-2011&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Because there were 1,334,200 unemployed Canadians in September and the unemployment rate was 7.1%. While the labour market created a significant number of jobs in September, the unemployment rate among workers aged 15 to 24 was 14.0%, and 48.2% of young workers are employed only part-time."&lt;ref&gt;["Latest Release from the Labour Force Survey."

Growth may come back later next year, while unemployment is likely to continue getting worse for some time after that."&lt;ref&gt;["Liberals Retain Narrow National Lead-June 18, 2009."

Personal reasons come first than voting as Gloria Galloway from ''The Globe And Mail'' comments, "But many of the respondents also cited personal circumstances.

How demographic of young voter turnouts emerging ethnic diversification factor?  "We know that youth are not a monolithic group and have, like older Canadians, multiple identities, but public policies do not adequately respond to their diverse realities and identities."&lt;ref&gt;[Mackinnon, Mary Pat. , Pitre, Sonia. , and Watling Judy.

Web. 26 Nov 2011. &lt; www.cprn.ca/documents/48800_FR.pdf&gt;P.19.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The quotation shows that ethnic diversity strongly engages with unengaged young people from immigrant families who have their own identity. And the statistics of number of immigrants prove that social differences affect young voter declines. It also demonstrates the impact of differences of social class, gender and educational experiences in shaping young people's political orientations and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[Fahmy, Eldin. ''Young Citizens: Young People's Involvement in Politics and Decision Making''. Hampshire; Burlington: Ashgate, 2006. P. 136.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political agenda-settings in Canadian newspapers==

Based on the agenda-setting writing, [[Robert A. Hackett|Robert Hackett]], "The News Media and Civic Equality: Watch dogs Mad dogs or Lap Dogs: Democratic Equality: What went wrong?" explains the media's agenda-setting role is a by-product of our collective dependence on mass media for information beyond our direct experience.&lt;ref&gt;[Hackett, Robert. "The News Media and Civic Equality: Watch dogs Mad dogs or Lap Dogs: Democratic Equality: What went wrong?" Ed. Broadbent, J. Edward,. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, political agenda setting in newspaper proposes a specific media's ideology, and characteristics of agenda settings.  For that reason, it is prominent to examining a newspaper by understanding the idea of ritual communication that [[James W. Carey|James Carey]] argues.&lt;ref&gt;[Carey, James. "A Cultural Approach to Communication: Communication as Culture." New York: Routledge, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of ritual communication refers "the transmission of signals or messages over distance for the purpose of control."&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.P.12]&lt;/ref&gt;  He suggests that communication explicitly demonstrates culture. That is, the key role of political agenda-setting proposes that projection of community centralizes the role of culture and a ritual view of communication.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The problems of political agenda-settings in newspaper===
In the original Chapel Hill study and many of the studies that have followed, both the media agenda and the public agenda consisted of a set of objects, public issues.&lt;ref&gt;[McCombs, Maxwell E., and Shaw, Donald L. "The Evolution of Agenda-Setting Research: Twenty-Five Years in the Marketplace of Ideas." ''Journal of Communication''. 1993. Pg.58-67.]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as Stephen P. Nicholson mentions in Voting The Agenda that [[Maxwell E. McCombs|McCombs]] and [[Donald L. Shaw|Shaw]] (1972)&lt;ref&gt;[Nicholson, Stephen P. ''Voting The Agenda: Candidates, Elections, And Ballot Propositions''. Princeton; Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2005. P.17.]&lt;/ref&gt;  were the first to examine the agenda-setting effect of media on public sphere. Nicholson noted that McCombs and Shaw examined the 1968 US presidential campaign as their setting, and as a result, the authors found that the mass media, as measured by content analysis of media coverage, had a substantial impact on the public's agenda. Nicholson continually demonstrates examples of Lyengar and Kinder (1987),&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on both experimental and quasi-experimental designs, and also found that media coverage of issues had a significant agenda-setting effect. In what terms are political agenda settings affecting the public through the Canadian newspapers? In the guise of contributing to political agenda settings, the newspapers conduct positive and negative arguments of specific national objects, such as politics, to create specific newspaper advocates. "Newspapers everywhere were now engaged in the hunt for popularity. Contemporaries noted the declining importance of the editorial page in the typical newspaper."&lt;ref&gt;[Rutherford, Paul. ''A Victorian Authority: The Daily Press in Late Nineteenth-Century Canada''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1982. P. 71-72.]&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, "most major newspapers endorsed the Conservatives, and none solely endorsed the Liberals or Greens. However Canada's highest circulated newspaper, the Toronto Star, advised to vote against the Conservatives."  Then it problematizes the range of newspapers covering stories.

===Canada newspapers coverage on election===

* The Star's Coverage on election based on their values
The core vision of [[Toronto Star]] aims to engage "in the full and frank dissemination of news and opinion, and to do so working within the highest standards of journalistic integrity. In reporting news and opinion, the Star seeks to inform the public of the significant and interesting events of the day, with particular emphasis on politics and public affairs." which the values established by Joseph E. Atkinson, according to Toronto Star Statement of Principles.&lt;ref&gt;["Toronto Star Statement of Principles." ''The Star''. 13 Apr 2011. Web. 25 Nov 2011. &lt;https://www.thestar.com/opinion/publiceditor/article/974222&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Joseph E. Atkinson comments that the principles of The Star are: "A strong and united Canada, civic engagement, individual and civil liberties, a necessary role for effective government and the rights of working people." &lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt; Atkinson's principles emerge as critical of liberal endorsement in the Canadian context.  For instance, The Star paper "usually endorses the Liberal Party federally. The Star was the only major daily to do so in the 2006 and the 2008 federal elections while many of the other major papers endorsed the Conservatives. The Star endorsed the social democratic [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] (NDP) leader Ed Broadbent in 1979 and Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield in 1972. The paper endorsed the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario in many of the provincial elections from the 1940s to the 1980s, and endorsed strategic voting to defeat Mike Harris in 1999."&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Star traced the role of speaking civil rights of working people and individuals by endorsing the NDP for the 2011 federal election. The Star states, "The platform the NDP offers voters is ambitious and puts people first. It focuses on seniors, health care and the environment…The NDP has never felt the discipline of power at the national level, and it shows." The Star criticized the Liberal Party's campaign under [[Michael Ignatieff]] has developed took everyone by surprise, which it was the biggest disappointment ever. Indeed, ''The Star'' concludes with "voters who believe Canada should aspire to something greater than the crabbed, narrow vision offered by the Harper Conservatives should look to Jack Layton and the New Democrats on Monday."&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Results show that [[Jack Layton]] was covered much more positively than Conservative and Liberal. The findings also show that respondents linked in the hunt for popularity.

* Reflection of election based on The Globe's ideology principles
A discourse of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' focuses exclusively on voice of the High Class elites agenda issues such as "the Bay Street financial community of Toronto and the intellectuals of university and government institutions." ''The Globe'' prevails the range of offerings to attract elites, well educated, and comfortably well-off high-income audience, whom numbered among the nation's agenda setters.&lt;ref&gt;[Hayes, David. Power and Influence. Toronto: Key Porter Books, 1992.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Globe endorses Stephen Harper's Conservative administration since 2008 federal election and 2011 federal elections. ''The Globe and Mail'' viewed "Mr. Harper has governed moderately and competently for nearly three years. He has not taken the country in dangerous new directions or significantly eroded the capacity of the government to act, when necessary, in the public interest." Globe also adds "Indeed, the most important characteristic Mr. Harper has shown over 33 months in office is a capacity to grow. There is no reason to think he won't continue along the same trajectory if re-elected — a good thing, too, since there is much more for him to learn."&lt;ref&gt;["Harper is growing into the job." ''The Globe and Mail''. 31 Mar 2009. Web. 25 Nov 2011. &lt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/harper-is-growing-into-the- job/article714679/page2/&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The basis of right wing editorial by The Globe, they praises opinion makers support Conservatives' ambitious efforts to cover their campaigns on newspapers.

==Inequitable values between young Canadians and Canadian newspapers==

The corresponding of ideology in the Canadian newspapers and young Canadians are not relevantly sharing equal beliefs or information in terms of democracy society. In at least two aspects, the Canadian newspapers obstacle in their duty to foster Young Canadians of voting act: first, the numbers of young Canadian newspaper readerships are very low.&lt;ref name="friends.ca"&gt;[Coleno, Jean. "Context and Ideology in the Canadian Media." ''Friends of Canadian Broadcasting''. 31 Mar 2003. Web. 25 Nov 2011. &lt; http://www.friends.ca/pub/190&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marshall McLuhan]] said, "People don't actually read newspapers."&lt;ref&gt;[''Attributed to Marshall McLuhan in The Oxford Dictionary of 20th Century Quotations''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;   Statistically, 68% of adults 18-34 read last weekday issue of their community newspapers, compared to only 34% read their last weekday daily newspaper based on Canada demographics conducted by ComBase.&lt;ref&gt;["Community Newspaper Readership: National and Provincial Overview." ''ComBase''. 2005. 25 Nov 2011. &lt; http://www.combase.ca/2008-2009/readership-highlights&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to statistics of young adults readership, Tiffany Conroy from Canadian Community Newspapers Association adds,"23% of adults 18-24 read any community newspaper last week, but did not read any daily newspaper."&lt;ref&gt;[Conroy, Tiffany. "Youth Readership: Good News, Bad News." ''CCNA''. 21 Mar 2005. Web. 25 Nov 2001. &lt; http://www.newspaperscanada.ca/news/ccna-news/youth-readership-good-news-bad-news&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A result of not reading daily newspaper is very hard to retain exclusive issues. The issue of not reading daily newspaper has strong relations to less engaged to act of voting. "The newspaper is the direct result of a national campaign by publishers, known as "Newspapers in Education" (NIE) according to Nola Kortner Aiex.&lt;ref&gt;[Aiex, Nola Kortner. "Using Newspapers as Effective Teaching Tools. ERIC Digest Number 10." ''ERIC Clearinghouse on Reading and Communication Skills Bloomington IN''. 1988. Web. 25 Nov 2011. &lt; http://www.ericdigests.org/pre-929/using.htm&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  As American Newspaper Publishers Association Foundation proposes "The Newspaper as an Effective Teaching Tool" (1981) explains the intent of the program and provides a variety of classroom activities using newspapers."&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt; The role of newspaper is significantly used for young adults as Aiex debates on Using Newspapers as Effective Teaching Tool. 
Second, the newspapers allow political debate to be monopolized by ideologues who adhere dogmatically to their respective political catechisms.&lt;ref name="friends.ca"/&gt;  As Robert A. Hackett argues the notions like propaganda and indoctrination are implied to manipulate and persuade in news media.&lt;ref&gt;[Hackett, Robert. T''he News Media and Civic Equality: Watch dogs Mad dogs or Lap Dogs: Democratic Equality: What went wrong?'' Ed. Broadbent, J. Edward,. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001. P.199.]&lt;/ref&gt;   Based on the evidence of The Star and Globe political agenda-settings presented, it would be premature to talk of a crisis of representing election campaign. "We cover the campaigns more than the election. We cover the narrative of the day-to-day event. We cover the news. The problem is there isn't actually whole a lot of news in the campaign." declared [[Andre Coyne]], national editor, ''MacLean'''s magazine who discussed newspaper coverage of the election campaign including narrative-setting, agendas, bias, and spin on September 27th 2011 at [[University of Toronto]], St.Michael's College class with Dr. [[Gerald Caplan]], political columnist at ''Globe and Mail.''&lt;ref&gt;[Caplan, Gerald., and Coyne, Andre. Class Lecture. "Newspaper coverage of the election campaign: narrative-setting, agendas, bias, spin." 03 Oct 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; They also argued that a lot of coverage unfortunately is aimed at political gentlemen. Moreover, they talked about how well newspapers are focusing the issues of election campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt; The fact is that young Canadians tend to be committed to their own structured democracy which differs from that of the parent generations. "The differences can mainly be seen in the ways that today's youth engage in politics, which is primarily through non-electoral activities."&lt;ref&gt;[ "The Values of Youth in Canada." Policy Horizons Canada. 27 Mar 2010. Web. 24 Nov 2011. &lt; http://www.horizons.gc.ca/page.asp?pagenm=2010-0016_02&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Conceptual links between young Canadian values and Canadian newspapers are not contributed to social cohesion, depending on the degree of difference that separates groups in their fundamental values by perceiving Hackett's ''"The News Media and Civic Equality: Watch Dogs, Mad Dogs, or Lap Dogs?'' In so doing, the media are reinforcing the political status quo by constraining oppositional mobilization, an impact consistent with the lap dog view.&lt;ref&gt;[Hackett, Robert. ''The News Media and Civic Equality: Watch dogs Mad dogs or Lap Dogs: Democratic Equality: What went wrong?'' Ed. Broadbent, J. Edward,. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001. P.199.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==What's next?==
Andrew Powell states "newspapers need to establish multi-platform strategies to engage readers that focus on the content rather than the format"&lt;ref&gt;[Powell, Andrew. W. "Newspapers Can Influence Youth to Become Regular Readers." ''CCNA''. 22 Jun 2008. Web. 25 Nov 2011. &lt;http://www.newspaperscanada.ca/news/ccna- news/newspapers-can-influence-youth-become-regular-readers&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  on Canadian Community Newspapers Association. He continues, "Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the study results was that loyal newspaper readers were more engaged members of their community than non-readers, but at the same time, editorial content in newspapers was seen as irrelevant to youth interests. When editorials did discuss youth, it was also seen as generally negative."&lt;ref&gt;[Ibid.]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Canadian Ethnic Studies Journal written by [[Karim H. Karim]], "younger Canada remains more committed to diversity and civil liberties than the older one."&lt;ref&gt;[Karim, Karim H. "Press, Public sphere, and pluralism: multiculturalism debates in Canadian english-language newspapers." Canadian Ethnic Studies Journal. 2008. Web. 25 Nov. 2011. &lt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb039/is_1_40/ai_n32432794/&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies show that current young adult voters turned out to be a political participation because the moral standards are different from parents' generation. "Today's tuned-out young voters are likely to be tomorrow's tuned-out middle-aged voters. And while it is by no means exclusively a Canadian political phenomenon, the decline in electoral participation by young adults is more steel in Canada than in other advanced democracies."&lt;ref&gt;[Anderssen, Erin., and Valpy, Michael.

Hackett argues to influence young audiences?&lt;ref&gt;[Hackett, Robert. ''The News Media and Civic Equality: Watch dogs Mad dogs or Lap Dogs: Democratic Equality: What went wrong?'' Ed. Broadbent, J. Edward,. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The more one does this, the harder it is to be a political mascot, for one cannot take note of the world's complexity without undermining one's faith in facile ideological solutions. As Orwell knew, the search for context is a step toward mental independence.&lt;ref&gt;[ Powell, Andrew. W. "Newspapers Can Influence Youth to Become Regular Readers." ''CCNA''. 22 Jun 2008. Web. 25 Nov 2011. &lt;http://www.newspaperscanada.ca/news/ccna- news/newspapers-can-influence-youth-become-regular-readers&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The cultivation of newspapers has less chance to influence young voters because citizens are already aware of the directions of newspaper contents. Indeed, the contents of newspapers hardly influence the insights of young Canadians because they contribute to contradicted social values and differentiate the political agenda settings.&lt;ref&gt;[Mackinnon, Mary Pat. , Pitre, Sonia. , and Watling Judy.

Addressing issues of convenience alone will not do it, he said. And he continues, "What is it that makes Canadians interested in politics?" Mr. Mayrand asked. "What is it that turns them off from time to time? And what is it that we can do about changing the culture around this?"&lt;ref&gt;[Galloway, Gloria.
