The '''17th century''' was the [[century]] that lasted from January 1, [[1601]], to December 31, [[1700]], in the [[Gregorian calendar]].
It falls into the [[Early Modern]] period of Europe and in that continent (whose impact on the world was increasing) was characterized by the [[Baroque]] cultural movement, the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the French ''{{ill|Grand Siècle|fr|Grand Siècle (histoire de France)}}'' dominated by [[Louis XIV]], the [[Scientific Revolution]], and according to some historians, [[the General Crisis]]. The greatest military conflicts were the [[Thirty Years' War]],&lt;ref name="TYW-WNEC"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Great Turkish War]], and the [[Dutch-Portuguese War]]. It was during this period also that [[European colonization of the Americas]] began in earnest, including the exploitation of the silver deposits, which resulted in bouts of inflation as wealth was drawn into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm|title=The Seventeenth-Century Decline|accessdate=13 August 2008|publisher=The Library of Iberian resources online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Islamic world]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Safavid|Safavid Persian]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] empires grew in strength. In India 
The Marathas dominated the political scene from the middle of the 17th century to the early 19th century as the Maratha Empire founded by [[Shivaji|Chatrapati Shivajiraje Bhosale]].  In Japan, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] established the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] at the beginning of the century, beginning the [[Edo period]]; the isolationist [[Sakoku]] policy began in the 1630s  and lasted until the 19th century. In China, the collapsing [[Ming dynasty]] was challenged by a series of conquests led by the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] warlord [[Nurhaci]], which were consolidated by his son [[Hong Taiji]] and finally consummated by his grandson, the [[Shunzhi Emperor|Shunzi Emperor]], founder of the [[Qing dynasty]].

European politics were dominated by the [[Kingdom of France]] of [[Louis XIV]], where royal power was solidified domestically in the [[civil war]] of the [[Fronde]]. The semi-feudal territorial [[French nobility]] was weakened and subjugated to the power of an [[absolute monarchy]] through the reinvention of the [[Palace of Versailles]] from a hunting lodge to a gilded prison, in which a greatly expanded royal court could be more easily kept under surveillance. With domestic peace assured, Louis XIV caused the borders of France to be expanded. It was during this century that [[Monarchy of England|English monarch]] became a symbolic figurehead and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was the dominant force in government – a contrast to most of Europe, in particular France.

By the end of the century, Europeans were aware of [[logarithm]]s, [[electricity]], the [[telescope]] and [[microscope]], [[calculus]], [[universal gravitation]], [[Newton's Laws of Motion]], [[air pressure]] and [[calculating machines]] due to the work of the first scientists of the [[Scientific Revolution]], including [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Johannes Kepler]], [[René Descartes]], [[Pierre Fermat]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Robert Boyle]], [[Christiaan Huygens]], [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[Isaac Newton]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. It was also a period of development of culture in general (especially theater, music, visual arts and philosophy).

In the year '''1977''', significant events in '''[[radio broadcasting]]''' included the [[President of the United States]] participating in a call-in radio program.

==Events==
*January – [[KIIK-FM|WRSQ-FM]] (104.9) signs on the air in [[Geneseo, Illinois]] as a sister station to WGEN-AM (1500 AM). The station's first call letters are short-lived, as the station will quickly adopt the callsign WGEN-FM. The initial format is [[country music]] with a community focus.
*February 18 – [[Belgischer Rundfunk]] (BRF) is founded and takes over responsibility for [[public service broadcasting|public-service]] radio broadcasting in the [[German language]] in Belgium.
*March 5 - President [[Jimmy Carter]] participates with [[Walter Cronkite]] in the ''Dial-a-President'' radio program on [[CBS]].
*May 12 - [[WTIC-FM]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] switches from [[European classical music|classical music]] to a new [[Top 40]] format designed by consultant [[Mike Joseph]]. This successful new approach will later be termed [[Hot Hits]].
*August 16 - Radio and television stations nationwide interrupt regular programming to report the death of [[Elvis Presley]].
*September 1 -- Dave Lingafelt begins airing "The Whacky Wake Up Crew" on [[WNNC]]-AM in Newton, North Carolina. He has been on the air for more than 35 years and has since purchased another AM station as well as 95.7 WXRC "The Ride."

===No dates===
*[[KSTP-FM]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] adopts its long-running [[soft rock]] format.

==Debuts==
*3 February: ''Adventure Theater'' (a children's program, not to be confused with ''[[Adventure Theater]]'', a 1956 anthology series on [[NBC]]) debuts on [[CBS]].&lt;ref name="dunningota"&gt;Dunning, John. (1998). ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507678-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closings==
*29 May: [[NBC Radio Network|NBC Radio]]'s all-news "News and Information Service" ceases operations, citing a low number of affiliates. Most stations switch to different formats, but [[KQV]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] launched a locally based production for its all-news format, which it maintains to the present day.

==Births==
* November - [[Heidi Cortez]], American model, writer, and radio host

==Deaths==

{{coord|42|50|35|N|71|12|25|W|type:landmark|display=title}}
'''America's Stonehenge''' is an archaeological site consisting of a number of large rocks and stone structures scattered around roughly {{convert|30|acre|m2}} within the town of [[Salem, New Hampshire]] in the United States. It is open to the public for a fee as part of a recreational area which includes [[snowshoe]] trails and an [[alpaca]] farm. It is a [[tourist attraction]] with particular appeal to believers in [[New Age]] systems.

A number of hypotheses exist as to the origin and purpose of the structures. One viewpoint is a mixture of land-use practices of local farmers in the 18th and 19th centuries and construction of structures by owner William Goodwin in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://granitegeek.org/blog/2006/11/01/locals-like-idea-of-utility-scale-wind-farm/ Professor at Central Connecticut State University view of site's history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726130637/http://granitegeek.org/blog/2006/11/01/locals-like-idea-of-utility-scale-wind-farm/ |date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some claim that the site has a [[pre-Columbian]] European origin, but this is regarded as [[pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeological]] or the result of an early-20th century [[hoax]].&lt;ref name=bubridge/&gt; Archaeologist David Starbuck has said that "it is widely believed that Goodwin may have 'created' much of what is visible at the site today".&lt;ref name=Starbuck/&gt;{{rp|106}}

The site was first dubbed '''Mystery Hill'''&lt;ref name="Greenberg"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]] |first1=Joel |last1=Greenberg |location=North Salem, New Hampshire |title=Mysteries in Stone {{ndash}} Near the Dairy Queen |agency=[[Knight Newspapers]] |date=March 20, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|868670|Mystery Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; by William Goodwin, an insurance executive who purchased the area in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Karen [http://discovermagazine.com/1998/feb/lightelementsyan1410 "Light Elements: Yankee Doodle Druid"], ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' (February 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; This was the official name of the site until 1982, when it was renamed "America's Stonehenge", a term [[neologism|coined]] in a news article in the early 1960s. The rebranding was an effort to separate it from [[Tourist trap|roadside oddity sites]] and to reinforce the idea that it is an ancient archaeological site. The area is named after [[Stonehenge]] in England, although there is no cultural connection between the two.

== Origin ==
The site first appears in print in the 1907 ''History of Salem, N.H.'': 
{{quote|text=Jonathan Pattee's Cave. He had a house in these woods 70 years ago; took town paupers before the town farm was bought. This is a wild but beautiful spot, among rough boulders and soft pines, about which the most weird and fantastic tale might be woven. There are several caves still intact, which the owner used for storage purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Edgar|title=The History of Salem, N.H. |year=1907|publisher=Rumford Press|pages=418}}[https://archive.org/stream/historyofsalemnh00gilb#page/418/mode/2up]&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
Many believe that Pattee built the site in the nineteenth century, and no unequivocal pre-Columbian European artifacts have been found there.&lt;ref&gt;Morison, Samuel Eliot, ''The European Discovery of America''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1971, p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

The site's history is muddled partly because of the activities of William Goodwin, who became convinced that the location was proof that [[Ireland|Irish]] [[monk]]s (the [[Culdee]]s) had lived there long before the time of [[Christopher Columbus]], and he sought to publicize the concept. The site has been altered by stone quarrying, and also by Goodwin and others who wanted to move the stones to what they considered to be their original locations; Goodwin might have been responsible for much of what can now be seen.&lt;ref name=Starbuck&gt;{{cite book|last=Starbuck|first=David R.|title=The Archeology of New Hampshire: Exploring 10,000 Years in the Granite State |year=2006|publisher=University of New Hampshire Press|isbn=978-1-58465-562-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|106–107}} Many of the stones have drill marks from the quarrying that took place on the site.&lt;ref name=Starbuck/&gt;{{rp|108}}

More fanciful origins have also been proposed, but [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s found on the site led [[archaeologist]]s to the conclusion that the stones were actually assembled for a variety of reasons by local farmers in the 18th and 19th centuries. For example, there is a so-called "sacrificial stone" which contains grooves that some say channeled blood, but it closely resembles "lye-leaching stones" found on many old farms that were used to extract [[lye]] from wood ashes, the first step in the manufacture of [[soap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/swift-blog/647-lie-leaching.html| author=Wagg, Jeff| title=Lie Leaching| date=July 24, 2009| accessdate=September 28, 2015| publisher=James Randi Educational Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, David Stewart-Smith, director of restoration at Mystery Hill, conducted an excavation of a megalith found in a stone quarry to the north of the main site. His research team excavated the quarry site under the supervision of the New Hampshire state archaeologist and discovered hundreds of chips and flakes from the stone. They concluded that this was evidence of tool manufacture, consistent with American Indian lithic techniques, although no date could be ascertained.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eQ7FCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=david+stewart-smith+state+archaeologist+nh&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a6FxJLtatm&amp;sig=Q0ReipNtDclPOoCdClXItJnaXvA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiO9LeisIDaAhUCmuAKHdQBBogQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20stewart-smith%20state%20archaeologist%20nh&amp;f=false "Pre-Columbian trans-Oceanic Contact" by Jerald Fritzinger, Page 22]&lt;/ref&gt;  Archaeologist Clive Runnels stated, "No Bronze Age artifacts have been found there, in fact, no one has found a single artifact of European origin from that period anywhere in the New World."&lt;ref name=bubridge/&gt;

==In popular culture==
American horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]] was an enthusiast for New England [[megalith]] sites, and he visited Mystery Hill sometime between 1928 and the 1930s.  The site is popularly attributed as inspiration for his story "[[The Dunwich Horror]]".&lt;ref&gt;Goudsward, David and Peter Stone. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8AiJzXBLLDkC&amp;pg=PA65 America's Stonehenge: the Mystery Hill story, from Ice Age to Stone Age]''. Wellesley, MA: Branden Books, 2003. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars, however, place Lovecraft's visit too late to have inspired the 1929 story.&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, S.T. ''The Annotated Lovecraft.'' New York: Dell, 1997. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was featured on an episode of the American [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] TV series ''[[Secrets of the Ancient World]]'' which aired on January 14, 2002, in which [[Boston University]] archaeology professor Curtis Runnels refuted the theory that it was built by Celts in ancient history.&lt;ref name=bubridge&gt;Fitzgerald, Brian. [http://www.bu.edu/bridge/archive/2002/02-01/archaeology.htm "Archaeology professor debunks claims for ancient rock structures as pseudoscientific fallacy"]. ''B.U. Bridge'' (February 1, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was also featured on the "Strange Visitors" episode of the ''[[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search of...]]'' TV series which focused on investigating mysterious phenomena. The episode aired on April 24, 1977 as the second episode in the first season of the show.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6532">Ship construction techniques can be categorized as one of hide, log, sewn, lashed-plank, clinker (and reverse-clinker), shell-first, and frame-first. While the frame-first technique dominates the modern [[shipbuilding|ship construction industry]], the ancients relied primarily on the other techniques to build their watercraft. In many cases, these techniques were very labor-intensive and/or inefficient in their use of raw materials. Regardless of differences in ship construction techniques, the vessels of the ancient world, particularly those that plied the waters of the Mediterranean Sea and the islands of [[Southeast Asia]] were seaworthy craft, capable of allowing people to engage in large-scale maritime [[trade]].{{sfn|Manguin|1993}}

==History==
The earliest archaeological evidence comes from dugout canoes found in peat bogs in Pesse, the Netherlands and dates to around 8000 years ago.,{{sfn|Bednarik|1997}} Seafaring is found around the world,{{sfn|McGrail|2004}} and many of these techniques are still in use today.{{sfn|McGrail|2003}}

==Framed Boats==

===Skin Boats===
Skin boats dominated seafaring in places that were scarce on wood, including the arctic and subarctic. They were made by stretching skin or leather over frames of wood or bone. These include [[kayak]]s and [[umiak]]s, [[coracle]]s and [[currach]]s.

===Bark Canoes===
Bark canoes were made by stretching bark over wooden frames, and were used by Native Americans in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adney|first1=Edwin Tappan|last2=Chapelle|first2=Howard Irving|title=Bark Canoes and Skin Boats of North America|date=2007|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Wooden Boats==

===Rafts===
Rafts were made where wood was available but not large enough to carve into dugouts and they could also be made from reeds. The earliest Egyptian boats were rafts made of papyrus; wooden boats did not replace rafts until the [[Gerzeh culture|Gerzean/Naqada II]] Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steve|first1=Vinson|title=Egyptian Boats and Ships|date=1994|publisher=Osprey Publishing|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dugout Boats===
[[Dugout (boat)|Dugout boats]] were made wherever trees grew large enough to support them, including Holocene Europe,{{sfn|Bednarik|1997}} the West Coast of America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dugout Canoe|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/dugout-canoe/|website=The Candiand Encyclopedia|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] seafarers. Dugouts are defined as being carved out of a single piece of wood, and they could be elaborately decorated and quite seaworthy.

==Shell First==
The shell-first technique involves constructing the "shell" of the boat first, then laying in the framework.

===Sewn and lashed-plank===
Instead of using nails, the planks of a boat can be "sewn" together with rope. Evidence for the use of sewn-fastenings in plank boats has been found worldwide. Fastenings of this type have been demonstrated to perform well in coastal regions, being capable of withstanding the rigors of heavy surf as well as the impact of [[Beaching (nautical)|beaching]].{{sfn|McGrail|2004|p=71, 77}} The lashed-plank technique can be found worldwide as well.{{sfn|Bellwood|Cameron|2007}}

===Clinker and reverse clinker===
The [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker]] and reverse-clinker construction techniques involve fastening together an overlapping layer of planks with straight nails (clinker) or hooked nails (reverse clinker). The clinker tradition developed in Northern Europe,{{sfn|McGrail|2004|p=244}} while the reverse-clinker technique, although very rarely found worldwide, has been found to be very prevalent among certain [[South Asia]]n communities, such as that of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] in [[India]].{{sfn|McGrail|2003}}

===Mortise-and-Tenon Joint===
This construction technique relied extensively on structural support provided by peg-[[mortise and tenon|mortise-and-tenon]] joinery through the shell of the boat. This method of ship construction appears to have originated from the seafaring nations of the Mediterranean, although evidence of peg-[[mortise and tenon|mortise-and-tenon]] joinery later appears in Southeast Asia.{{sfn|Bellwood|Cameron|2007}}

==Frame-First==
Frame-first construction involves laying down the framework of the vessel before attaching the planks to the boat. This is normally done by erecting a "master frame" in the center of the keel, and deriving the shapes of the other frames using a curved piece of wood stretched between the frame and the end posts, or through a geometric curve. The [[Yassiada]] wreck dating to the 7th century AD was long cited as the earliest evidence for frame-first construction technique, but two wrecks for Dor (Tanura) Lagoon in Israel dated to around 500 CE were built frame first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Catsambi|first1=Alexis|last2=Ford|first2=Ben|last3=Hamilton|first3=Donny|title=The Oxford Handbook of Maritime Archaeology|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique was rarer in the rest of the world until the coming of the modern era.{{sfn|Bellwood|Cameron|2007}}{{sfn|McGrail|2004}}

"'''Anorak'''" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|ər|æ|k}} is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[slang]] which refers to a person who has a very strong interest, perhaps obsessive, in niche subjects. This interest may be unacknowledged or not understood by the general public. The term is sometimes used synonymously with "[[geek]]" or "[[nerd]]", the Spanish term "friki", or the Japanese term "[[otaku]]", albeit referring to different niches.

==Etymology==
In 1984 the ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' newspaper used the term as a [[metonym]] for the prototype group interested in detailed trivia, the [[trainspotter]]s,&lt;ref name=Games2007&gt;{{Citation

The first use of the phrase to describe an obsessive fan has also been credited to the radio presenter [[Andy Archer (radio presenter)|Andy Archer]], who used the term in the early 1970s for fans of [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|offshore radio]], who would charter boats to come out to sea to visit the radio ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Went the Pirates II|first=Keith|last=Skues|authorlink=Keith Skues|publisher=Lambs' Meadow Publications|place=[[Horning]]|isbn=978-0-907398-05-9|year=2009|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Indie pop]] band [[Another Sunny Day]] released a single called "Anorak City" in 1988 on [[Sarah Records]]. The "anoraks" described in the lyrics are independent pop fans.
* [[Progressive rock]] band [[Marillion]] titled their twelfth studio album ''[[Anoraknophobia]]'', released in 2001, referring to the long running in-joke that Marillion fans are sometimes called freaks or anoraks.

This article describes the composition and actions of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] air forces in the [[Falklands War]] ({{lang-es|Guerra de las Malvinas}}), which comprised units of the Air Force, Army, Navy and other services.

==Background==
Despite initiating the war, Argentina had not prepared a plan for the subsequent defence of the islands. The military dictatorship that governed the country at the time regarded the seizure of the Falklands as a political act to obtain a diplomatic bargaining position, and not as an act of war. Consequently they were taken by surprise when the British responded with a large-scale mobilization, and a task force to retake the islands.&lt;ref name="airpower.maxwell.af.mil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj02/fal02/corum.html|title=Argentine Airpower in the Falklands War: An Operational View|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IAI Dagger fuerza aerea argentina.jpg|thumb|right|IAI ''Dagger'', Argentine Air Force, 1984]]

The [[Argentine Air Force]] (''Fuerza Aérea Argentina''; FAA) had never considered the possibility of waging a long-range naval air campaign against a major [[NATO]] power. It was not trained or equipped for such a mission. The FAA had only two tanker aircraft to serve the whole air force and navy, and its fighter-bomber [[Mirage III]]s and [[IAI Dagger]]s were not equipped for [[aerial refuelling]]. The FAA's training, tactics and equipment were focused on a possible war against [[Chile]], resulting from disputes such as the [[Beagle conflict]].&lt;ref name="airpower.maxwell.af.mil"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/DWF.htm|title=Offensive Air Operations Of The Falklands War|author=John Pike|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The option to attack Chile&lt;ref name="perfil-22.11.2009"&gt;Argentine newspaper [[Perfil]] [http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0420/articulo.php?art=18309&amp;ed=0420 Después de Malvinas, iban a atacar a Chile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125142325/http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0420/articulo.php?art=18309&amp;ed=0420 |date=2009-11-25 }} on 22 November 2009, retrieved 22 November 2009:
:''"Para colmo, Galtieri dijo en un discurso: „Que saquen el ejemplo de lo que estamos haciendo ahora porque después les toca a ellos“"''.&lt;/ref&gt; was a cause of great concern to the Argentina military during the war. The [[Military of Chile|Chilean armed forces]] had deployed a significant force to Chile's common border with Argentina, and the FAA was forced to reinstate their retired [[F-86 Sabre]]s to bolster Argentina's air defences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lt.

Hezsely | first =Csaba | title =Argentine Air Power in the Falklands War | journal = Air War College, Research Report | volume = | issue = | pages = 39 | date = May 1988 | url = http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a202551.pdf | id = AD-A202 551}} Lt. Col. Hezsely's report notes 16 F-86F deployed at Mendoza&lt;/ref&gt; In Argentina's favour, [[Peru]] immediately offered its support to the Argentine cause, with the [[Peruvian Air Force]] even offering to fly combat missions. This was politely declined by the Argentine government. As the war progressed, Peru and [[Venezuela]] sent critical aircraft spare parts to Argentina, urgently needed by the FAA and the [[Brazilian Air Force]] leased two [[Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante|EMB111 Bandeirantes]] maritime patrol aircraft to the Argentine Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trackerenmalvinas.com.ar/html/download.html |title=PDF book: Historia de la Aviacion Naval Argentina |publisher=''www.trackerenmalvinas.com.ar'' |accessdate=2010-01-21 |language=es |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517220622/http://www.trackerenmalvinas.com.ar/html/download.html |archivedate=2007-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally on June 4, ten Peruvian [[Mirage 5]] with [[AS-30]] missiles arrived to [[Tandil]] but the war ended before they could be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagger-lamarinete.com.ar/peru.htm Dagger Technician memories]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israel Aircraft Industries]] technicians that were in the country under the 1979 [[IAI Dagger]]s contract continued their work during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagger-lamarinete.com.ar/3al5deabril.htm Dagger Technician memories]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the best estimates, Argentina totaled about 240 planes when the war broke out. About half of those were posted in the interior and along the Chilean border.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1828&amp;dat=19820526&amp;id=CNAhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xZ4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1465,10774806 Los Angeles times, May 27 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; The long distances from their bases prevented them from using their top speed or they risked running out of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;''Aviation Fact File - Harrier'', page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=n&gt;"the Mach 2 Mirage and Dagger which in low-level attack are extremely subsonic. ..while low-level attacks by the Argentine aircraft..there would not be a lot of fuel to spare, especially if afterburner was used." From ''Aviation Fact File - Harrier'' (1984), page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Argentines had more aeroplanes than the British Task force, a good number of them were Pucara turboprops.&lt;ref&gt;''Sea Combat off the Falklands'' (1982), page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=n&gt;"The Argentine-built Pucará counter-insurgency aircraft proved its worth in numerous attacks on British land forces, and it was even used to attack shipping. About 75 Pucarás were in service at the start of the conflict." From ''Sea Combat off the Falklands'' (1982), page 33; by Antony Preston; Willow Books, {{ISBN|978-0-00-218046-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the A-4 Skyhawk force were dependent on the two available KC-130 tankers, limiting the amount of aeroplanes that could attack simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;"Two A-4B Skyhawks warplanes of the Grupo 5 link up...after topping up their tanks from a KC-130H tanker." page 62 in ''Air War in the Falklands 1982'', 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Argentina's fleet of [[A-4 Skyhawk]] attack jets was in very poor condition. The arms embargo placed by the United States in 1976, due to the "[[dirty war|Dirty War]]", had made most airframes unusable. The involvement of Israel in helping to return the A-4 to full operational status has been alleged, but has never been confirmed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Commodore Ruben Oscar Moro  ''La Guerra Inaudita'', 2000 {{ISBN|987-96007-3-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The small [[Argentine Naval Aviation|air arm of the Argentine Navy]] (''Armada Republica Argentina''; ARA) was in the middle of the transition from the A-4Q Skyhawk to the new [[Super Etendard]]. Only five of the Etendard's anti-ship [[Exocet]] missiles had been delivered at the time of the conflict, at which point an arms embargo prevented the delivery of further shipments. Additionally, the required programming for the missiles to interact with the Etendard's computers had not been completed by French engineers when the conflict broke out. France, being an ally of the United Kingdom, recalled all technicians, which left Argentine scientists and electronic engineers to figure out a way to make the missiles take input from the plane's computers. Navy pilots, particularly those of the 3rd Naval Fighters Squadron flying ''A-4Qs'' were the only ones trained in bombing warships. Air Force pilots trained during April against the two Argentine [[Type 42 destroyer|Type 42]] destroyers, similar to those of the British Fleet, and according to the Naval officers all the sorties were shot down, causing great concern to the High Command until the successful May 1 strikes which proved that aircraft could survive.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HALCONES SOBRE MALVINAS, {{ISBN|950-9294-07-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Argentine military aviation had never been involved in an international conflict, indeed the last time the Argentine military had been involved in an international conflict was the [[Paraguayan War|War of the Triple Alliance]] more than a century before.

In spite of these disadvantages, Argentine air units bore the brunt of the battle during the six-week war, and inflicted serious damage and losses to the naval forces of the United Kingdom. Low-flying jets attacking British ships provided some of the most sobering and dramatic images of the war. By the end of the conflict, the British forces had come to admire the FAA's spirited conduct in the face of an effective air defence network.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, Max: ''The Battle for the Falklands''&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=n&gt;"The British were awed by the courage of the Argentine pilots, flying suicidally low to attack, then vanishing amid flashes of pursuing Sea Cat, Blowpipe, Rapier, racing across the sky behind them. Alone among the enemy's three services, the air force seemed highly motivated and utterly committed to the battle. 'We should have been able to work out that any nation which produces first-class Formula One racing drivers is also likely to turn out some pretty good pilots.'" - Chapter 12; Hastings, Max: ''The Battle for the Falklands'' (1983) Michael Joseph Ltd {{ISBN|0-7181-2228-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Admiral [[Sandy Woodward]], the British Task Force commander said: "[t]he Argentine Air Force fought extremely well and we felt a great admiration for what they did."&lt;ref&gt;clarin newspaper [http://www.clarin.com/diario/2007/04/03/elpais/p-00815.htm Clarin newspaper Woodward Interview &lt;br&gt; ''La fuerza aérea peleó extremadamente bien y nosotros sentimos una gran admiración por lo que hicieron'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Operational Research Branch Report declassified and released to the public in February 2013 states: 
{{cquote| The Argentine air arms conducted a 10 week campaign during which time they carried out air supply of their forces in the Falkland Islands, reconnaissance of UK forces in the South Atlantic, and engaged units of TF317. Though they sustained considerable damage, it is fair to say that their air forces were not beaten and remained as a viable force at the end of hostilities. The 4 air arms &lt;sup&gt; (ndlr: [[Argentine Air Force|FAA]], [[Argentine Naval Aviation|COAN]], [[Argentine Army Aviation|CAE]], [[Argentine Naval Prefecture|PNA]] )&lt;/sup&gt; were, within their own spheres, generally capable and well organised, though limited in [[Aerial refueling|AAR]] and [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance]] assets. A lack of aircraft spares may also have limited their effectiveness. Of the 3 facets of operations, the Argentine air arms are considered to have been successful in the air supply of their forces, only partially successful in the reconnaissance task, and to have inflicted significant attrition on UK naval forces. No militarily significant success was achieved against UK land forces ashore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcre.com/archive/falklands/argaireffort|title=Examination of Argentine Air Effort - Arcre|author=Lee Richards|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Organisation==
The air units involved in the Falklands War were under the following [[chain of command]]:
* ''' [[National Reorganization Process|Military junta]]''' – [[Brigadier General#Argentina|Brigadier General]] &lt;sup&gt;(Lieutenant General)&lt;/sup&gt; [[Basilio Lami Dozo]]
** '''Air Defence Command''' ({{lang-es|Comando Aéreo de Defensa}}) – Brigadier [[Augusto Hughes|Jorge Hughes]] was in charge of the radar network, Mirage IIIEA interceptors and anti-aircraft defences on the mainland.
** '''Strategic Air Command''' ({{lang-es|Comando Aéreo Estratégico}}) - Brigadier Helmuth Weber. Coordinated air assets through all the country. The CAE also had the main role of long range maritime surveillance with Boeing 707s and C-130 Hercules.
*** '''Southern Air Force''' ({{lang-es|Fuerza Aérea Sur}}) – Brigadier [[Ernesto Horacio Crespo|Ernesto Crespo]].  The FAS was the main organisation involved in combat over the conflict zone.
** '''South Atlantic Military Theatre''' ({{lang-es|Teatro Operaciones Atlantico Sur}}) - Vice Admiral [[Juan Lombardo]]. Basically a [[Argentine Navy|naval]] command with the role of coordinating the air, surface and submarine assets in the South Atlantic area. Initially, during the [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invasion of the islands]] on 2 April and before hostilities broke out, the islands were supposedly to be under their command and was considered as the only organisation needed to manage the ''crisis''.
*** '''Falklands Military Garrison''' ({{lang-es|Guarnicion Militar Malvinas}}) - Brigade General [[Mario Benjamín Menéndez|Mario Menéndez]] ([[Argentine Army|Army]])

Air units moved from home bases to southern facilities. Amid fears about British/Chilean air strikes and/or [[Special Air Service|SAS]] raids, Argentine aircraft were dispersed in the surrounding areas of their southern airfields, e.g., several parts of the national route #3 were used for this purpose.

===Missions===
*'''Attack Missions''':
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! style="width:150px;"|System
! style="width:600px;"|Obs
|-
| [[A-4 Skyhawk]]
| 133 sorties by the A-4B and 86 by the A-4C. They flew with unreliable [[ejection seat]]s due to the US embargo placed from 1977. Naval A-4Q performed 12 sorties. They were highly dependent on the two available KC-130 tankers, limiting the number of aeroplanes that could attack simultaneously.
|-
| [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]]
| 46 bombing sorties against ground targets, operating from [[Trelew]], to avoid more congestion on the closer southern airfields.
|-
| [[IAI Nesher|Dagger]]
| 153 sorties against naval/ground targets by the two squadrons. Their lack of [[aerial refueling]] capacity severely affected their performance without any chance of manoeuvring over the islands. They were obliged to fly the shortest flightpath and had less than 10 minutes to find their targets. The discovery of their approach corridor by the British led to 7 aircraft being shot down by Sea Harriers [[Combat air patrol|CAP]], something just realized when one of the downed Dagger pilots was recovered by own troops. By the end of May they began carrying an improvised [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|chaff]] dispenser consisting of aluminium strips inside their airbrakes.
|-
!Total Sorties:
| The above figures shown a total of 430 attack sorties from the mainland of which 18 aircraft were intercepted by the Sea Harriers and another 14 were shot down by anti aircraft defences.

'''Comer Vann Woodward''' (November 13, 1908 – December 17, 1999) was a [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]-prize winning [[United States|American]] [[historian]] focusing primarily on the [[American South]] and [[race relations]].  He was long a supporter of the approach of [[Charles A. Beard]], stressing the influence of unseen economic motivations in politics. Stylistically, he was a master of irony and counterpoint. Woodward was on the left end of the history profession in the 1930s. By  the 1950s he was a leading liberal and supporter of civil rights.  His demonstration that racial segregation was a late  19th century invention rather than some sort of eternal standard made his ''The Strange Career of Jim Crow'' into "the historical Bible of the civil rights movement", said  Martin Luther King Jr. After attacks on him by the New Left in the late 1960s, he moved to the right politically.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Hackney, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
C. Vann Woodward was born in [[Vanndale, Arkansas|Vanndale]], a town named after his mother's family and the county seat from 1886-1903.  It was in [[Cross County, Arkansas|Cross County]] in eastern [[Arkansas]]. Woodward attended [[Morrilton High School (Arkansas)|high school]] in [[Morrilton, Arkansas]]. He attended [[Henderson State University|Henderson-Brown College]], a small [[Methodist]] school in [[Arkadelphia, Arkansas|Arkadelphia]], for two years. In 1930 he transferred to [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where his uncle was dean of students and professor of [[sociology]]. After graduating, he taught English composition for two years at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] in Atlanta. There he met [[Will W. Alexander]], head of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation, and J. Saunders Redding, a historian at [[Atlanta University]].&lt;ref&gt;John Herbert Roper, ''C. Vann Woodward: Southerner'' (1987) ch 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodward enrolled in graduate school at [[Columbia University]] in 1931 and received his M.A. from that institution in 1932. In New York, Woodward met, and was influenced by, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Langston Hughes]], and other figures who were associated with the [[Harlem Renaissance]] movement. After receiving his master's degree in 1932, Woodward worked for the defense of [[Angelo Herndon]], a young [[African-American]] [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] member who had been accused of subversive activities. He also traveled to the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Germany]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, ''C. Vann Woodward'' (1987) ch 3&lt;/ref&gt;

He did graduate work in history and [[sociology]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]]. He was granted a Ph.D. in history in 1937, using as his dissertation the manuscript he had already finished on [[Thomas E. Watson]]. Woodward's dissertation director was [[Howard K. Beale]], a [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] specialist who promoted the Beardian economic interpretation of history that deemphasized ideology and ideas and stressed material self-interest as a motivating factor.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, ''C. Vann Woodward'' (1987) ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[World War II]], Woodward served in the Navy, assigned to write the history of major battles. His ''The [[Battle for Leyte Gulf]]'' (1947) became the standard study of the largest naval battle in history.

==Career==
Woodward, starting out on the left politically, wanted to use history to explore dissent. He approached [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] about writing about him, and thought of following his biography of Watson with one of [[Eugene V. Debs]].&lt;ref&gt;Hackney, (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  He picked Georgia politician [[Thomas E. Watson|Tom Watson]], who in the 1890s was a [[Populism|populist]] leader focusing the anger and hatred of poor whites against the establishment, banks, railroads and businessmen. Watson in 1908 was the presidential candidate of the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist Party]], but this time was the leader in mobilizing the hatred of the same poor whites against blacks, and a promoter of lynching.&lt;ref&gt;C. Vann Woodward, "Tom Watson and the Negro in agrarian politics." ''Journal of Southern History'' 4#1 (1938): 14-33. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2191851 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, ''Tom Watson: Agrarian Rebel'' (Macmillan, 1938).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Strange Career of Jim Crow''===
Woodward's most influential book was ''The Strange Career of Jim Crow'' (1955), which explained that segregation was a relatively late development and was not inevitable. After the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', in spring 1954, Woodward gave the Richards Lectures at the University of Virginia. The lectures were published in 1955 as ''The Strange Career of Jim Crow''.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, ''C. Vann Woodward,'' pp 171-200&lt;/ref&gt; With Woodward in the audience in Montgomery, Alabama, in March 1965, [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] proclaimed the book "the historical bible of the Civil Rights Movement."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  It reached a large popular audience and helped shape the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.

Jim Crow laws, Woodward argued, were not part of the immediate aftermath of Reconstruction; they came later and were not inevitable.  Following the [[Compromise of 1877]], in the 1870s and 1880s there were localized informal practices of racial separation in some areas of society along with what he termed "forgotten alternatives" in others. Finally the 1890s saw white southerners "capitulate to racism" to create "legally prescribed, rigidly enforced, state-wide Jim Crowism."&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, ''The Strange Career of Jim Crow'' (1974 edition), page xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Origins of the New South, 1877-1913''===
Scholars especially praised ''Origins of the New South, 1877-1913'', which was published in 1951 by Louisiana State University Press in a prominent multivolume history of the South. It combined the Beardian theme of economic forces shaping history, and the Faulknerian tone of tragedy and declension.  He insisted on the discontinuity of the era, and rejected both the romantic ante-bellum popular images of the [[Lost Cause]] School as well as the overoptimistic business boosterism of the [[New South|New South Creed]]. [[Sheldon Hackney]], a Woodward student, hails the book, explaining:&lt;ref&gt;Hackney (1972) p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of one thing we may be certain at the outset. The durability of ''Origins of the New South'' is not a result of its ennobling and uplifting  message. It is the story of the decay and decline of the aristocracy, the suffering  and betrayal of the poor whites, and the rise and transformation  of a middle class. It is not a happy story. The [[Redeemers]] are revealed to be as venal as the [[carpetbaggers]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The declining aristocracy are ineffectual and money hungry, and in the last analysis they subordinated the values of their political and social heritage in order to maintain control over the black population. The poor whites suffered from strange malignancies of racism and conspiracy-mindedness, and the rising middle class was timid and self-interested even in its reform movement. The most sympathetic characters in the whole sordid affair are simply those who are too powerless to be blamed for their actions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Appointments, teaching and awards===
Woodward taught at [[Johns Hopkins University]] from 1946 to 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, ''C. Vann Woodward'' (1987) pp 134-5, 141&lt;/ref&gt; He became Sterling Professor of History at [[Yale University|Yale]] from 1961 to 1977, where he taught both graduate students and undergraduates. He did much writing but little original research at Yale, writing frequent essays for such outlets as the ''[[New York Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, ''C. Vann Woodward'' (1987) p 197&lt;/ref&gt;  He directed scores of PhD dissertations, including those by [[John W. Blassingame]]; former chair of the African American studies program at Yale; Daniel W. Crofts, former chair of the History Department at The College of New Jersey; [[James M. McPherson]]; [[Patricia Nelson Limerick]], Professor of History at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]; [[Michael Wayne (historian)|Michel Wayne]], Professor of History at the [[University of Toronto]]; [[Steven Hahn]], Professor of History at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]; John Herbert Roper, Richardson Chair of American History at [[Emory &amp; Henry College]]; and David L. Carlton, Professor of History at [[Vanderbilt University]].

In 1974, the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]] asked Woodward for an historical study of misconduct in previous administrations and how the [[President of the United States|Presidents]] responded. Woodward led a group of fourteen historians and they produced a 400-page report in less than four months,  ''Responses of the Presidents to Charges of Misconduct''.

In 1978 the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] selected Woodward for the [[Jefferson Lecture]], the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]].  His lecture, entitled "The European Vision of America,"&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lecturers] at NEH Website (retrieved January 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; was later incorporated into his book ''The Old World's New World.''&lt;ref&gt;C. Vann Woodward, ''The Old World's New World'' (Oxford University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0-19-506451-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodward won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1982 for ''[[Mary Chesnut's Civil War]]'', an edited version of [[Mary Chesnut]]'s [[American Civil War|Civil War]] diary. He won the [[Bancroft Prize]] for ''Origins of the New South''.

==Controversies==
[[Peter Novick]] says, "Vann Woodward was always very conflicted about the "presentism" of his work. He alternated between denying it, qualifying it, and apologizing for it."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Novick, ''That Noble Dream: The 'Objectivity Question' and the American Historical Profession'' (1988) p 359&lt;/ref&gt; British historian Michael O'Brien, the editor of Woodward's letters in 2013, says that by the 1970s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He became greatly troubled by the rise of the black power movement, disliked affirmative action, never came to grips with feminism, mistrusted what came to be known as "theory," and became a strong opponent of multiculturalism and "political correctness."&lt;ref&gt;Michael O'Brien, ed., ''The Letters of C. Vann Woodward'' (2013)  p. xl&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1969, as president of the [[American Historical Association]], Woodward led the fight to defeat a proposal by New Left historians to politicize the organization. He wrote his daughter afterwards, "The preparations paid off and I had pretty well second-guessed the Rads on every turn."&lt;ref&gt;Hackney, 2009, p 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975-6 Woodward led the unsuccessful fight at Yale to block the temporary appointment of Communist historian [[Herbert Aptheker]] to teach a course.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, ''C. Vann Woodward'' (1987) pp 268-84&lt;/ref&gt; Radicals denounced his actions but a joint committee of the [[Organization of American Historians]] and the [[American Historical Association]] exonerated the process and found that there was no evidence that political criteria had been used. In 1987 he joined the conservative scholars who made up the [[National Association of Scholars]], a group explicitly opposed to the academic Left. Woodward wrote a favorable review in the ''New York Review of Books'' of [[Dinesh D'Souza]]'s ''Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus.'' It said that Duke University used racial criteria when it hired [[John Hope Franklin]]; Franklin and Woodward publicly feuded.&lt;ref&gt;John Hope Franklin, ''Mirror To America: The Autobiography of John Hope Franklin'' (2005), pp 325-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Hackney says, "Woodward became an open critic of political correctness and in other ways appeared to have shifted his seat at the political table."&lt;ref&gt;Hackney, 2009, p 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
C. Vann Woodward died in [[Hamden, Connecticut]] in 1999.

The [[Southern Historical Association]] has established the ''C. Vann Woodward Dissertation Prize'', awarded annually to the best dissertation on Southern history. There is a ''Peter V. and C. Vann Woodward Chair of History'' at Yale; it is now held by southern historian [[Glenda Gilmore]]. (Peter was Woodward's son, who died at age 25 in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodward|first1=Susan Lampland|title=In Memoriam: Pete Woodward|url=http://yale64.org/remembrances/woodward.htm|website=Yale University Class of 1964|accessdate=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''''Crash Course''''' (sometimes stylized as '''''CrashCourse''''') is an educational [[YouTube]] channel started by the [[Green brothers]], [[Hank Green]] and [[John Green (author)|John Green]], who are notable for their [[VlogBrothers]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pot|first=Justin|url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/crash-entertaining-youtube-courses-history-biology/|title=Crash Course: Entertaining YouTube Courses On History &amp; Biology|publisher=''Make Use Of''|date=April 7, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roetthers|first=Janko|url=https://gigaom.com/2012/02/16/youtubes-new-tv-stars/|title=A first look at YouTube's new TV stars|publisher=''GigaOM''|date=February 16, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leib|first=Bart|url=http://archive.wired.com/geekdad/2012/03/scishow-crash-course/|title=Scishow &amp; Crash Course: Why Isn't School This Cool?|publisher=''Wired''|date=March 23, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, John and Hank presented [[humanities]] and [[science]] courses to viewers, respectively,&lt;ref name="newyorkerteenwhisperer"&gt;{{cite web|last=Talbot|first=Margaret|url= http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/09/the-teen-whisperer|title=The Teen Whisperer|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the series has since expanded to incorporate courses by additional hosts.

''Crash Course'' was one of the 100 initial channels of [[YouTube Original Channel Initiative|YouTube's $100 million original channel initiative]]. ''Crash Course'' launched a preview on December 2, 2011. As of Feb 14, 2018, the ''Crash Course'' YouTube channel has over 7 million subscribers and has received more than 609 million video views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse/about|title=CrashCourse about|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=May 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, Hank Green announced that a partnership with [[PBS Digital Studios]] would allow them to produce more courses, starting in January 2015.

To date, there are 33 main series of ''Crash Course'', with John hosting seven and Hank hosting seven. Together with [[Emily Graslie]], they also co-hosted ''Big History''. Alongside the PBS partnership, and with John commencing a year-long hiatus from the show in 2015, additional hosts were brought in to increase the number of concurrent series: [[Phil Plait]] (''Astronomy''), [[Craig Benzine]] (''U.S. Government and Politics'' and ''Film History''), Adriene Hill (''Economics'' and ''Statistics''),  Jacob Clifford (''Economics''), Shini Somara (''Physics'' and ''Engineering''), Andre Meadows (''Games''), [[Carrie Anne Philbin]] (''Computer Science''), Mike Rugnetta (''Mythology'' and ''Theater''), Nicole Sweeney (''Sociology''), [[Emily Graslie]] (''Big History 2''), [[Lily Gladstone]] (''Film Production''), [[Michael Aranda]] (''Film Criticism''), Thomas Frank (''Study Skills''), [[Jay Smooth]] (''Media Literacy''), and Miriam Nielsen (''Human Geography'').

A second channel, ''Crash Course Kids'', is hosted by [[Sabrina Cruz]] and has completed its first series, ''Science''. The first foreign-language course, an [[Arabic]] reworking of the original ''World History'' series, is hosted by Yasser Abumuailek. The main channel has also begun a series of shorter animated episodes, called ''Recess'', that focus on topics from previous ''Crash Course'' series.

==Production==
The science series (and ''Philosophy'', but not ''Computer Science'') are filmed in [[Missoula, Montana]], in a studio building that also houses ''[[SciShow]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Green|first=Hank|title=Meet the Team: The Missoula Office (And P4A and TheBrainScoop)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhVxNo-HA8g|publisher=YouTube|work=Crash Course|date=December 21, 2012|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Biology'' and ''Ecology'' series were filmed in front of [[green screen]]. From the ''Chemistry'' season onward, these series were filmed on new custom-built sets. These series are produced and edited by Nicholas Jenkins, while Blake de Pastino serves as script editor. The sound design and music for these series are provided by [[Michael Aranda]] and in later series, his company Synema Studios.

The humanities series (except ''Philosophy'' and ''Economics'') and ''Computer Science'' are filmed in a studio in Indianapolis, Indiana, which is also home to ''[[The Art Assignment]]'' and ''Healthcare Triage''. They are produced and edited by Stan Muller, Mark Olsen, and Brandon Brungard.

''Crash Course Kids'' was filmed in a studio in Toronto, Ontario. The series was directed by Michael Aranda, and produced by the Missoula ''Crash Course'' team.

''Crash Course Economics'' is filmed in the YouTube Space in Los Angeles, California, and produced by the Indianapolis ''Crash Course'' team.

Graphic design for all of the series except ''Biology'' and ''Ecology'' is provided by Thought Café (formerly Thought Bubble).

Starting with the ''Statistics'' course in early 2018, courses that are not PBS co-productions are directly identifying as made by Complexly, complete with logo branding and suggestions for their other channels.

=== Funding ===
[[File:Craig Benzine (7486834826).jpg|thumb|[[Craig Benzine]], host of ''U.S. Government and Politics'', was brought on as part of the [[PBS Digital Studios]] funding deal.]]The ''Crash Course'' YouTube channel was teased in December 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Green|first=John|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrlJl2UXRU0|title=Crash Course Preview|publisher=YouTube|work=Crash Course|date=December 2, 2011|accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched in January 2012 as one of the initial [[YouTube Original Channel Initiative|original, YouTube-funded channels]].&lt;ref name="Coolforschool" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutelle|first=Sam|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2012/10/16/barack-obama-for-america-tumblr-vlog-brothers/|title=Barack Obama Watches The Vlogbrothers|publisher=''Tubefilter''|date=October 16, 2012|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, John Green detailed that ''Crash Course'' was going through financial hardships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutelle|first=Sam|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/04/02/john-green-vlogbrothers-reddit-iama/|title=John Green Talks 'Crash Course', 'Hank Games', And Hats In Reddit IamA|publisher=''Tubefilter''|date=April 2, 2013|accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, Hank Green expressed his frustration with the ways [[YouTube]] had been changing and controlling its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutelle|first=Sam|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/07/17/hank-green-pissed-about-youtube/|title=Hank Green Is Pissed Off About YouTube's Constant Changes|publisher=''Tubefilter''|date=July 17, 2013|accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Hank|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lptCYUfN_dg|title=A Chat with YouTube|publisher=YouTube|work=hankschannel|date=July 17, 2013|accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funds from Google eventually ran out, and shortly after Green's ''A Chat with YouTube'' video, the [[VlogBrothers]] decided to launch ''[[Subbable]]'', a [[crowdfunding]] website where viewers can donate, monthly, to channels in return for perks. Donating is optional, as Hank Green stated, "We ascribe to the idealistic notion that audiences don't pay for things because they have to but because they care about the stuff that they love and want it to continue to grow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kqed.org/arts/124879/crowdfunding_matures_with_a_lesson_from_public_broadcasting|title=Crowdfunding Matures with a Lesson from Public Broadcasting|last=Eifler|first=Emily|date=August 20, 2013|website=|publisher=''KQED''|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Crash Course'' was the first series and channel to be offered on ''Subbable'', and from this point onward, would be funded by the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutelle|first=Sam|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/07/22/vlogbrothers-subbable-pay-what-you-want-hank-john-green/|title=Vlogbrothers Launch Subbable, A 'Pay What You Want' Video Platform|publisher=''Tubefilter''|date=July 22, 2013|accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, ''Subbable'' was acquired by ''[[Patreon]]'', and ''Crash Course''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s crowdfunding was moved over to ''Patreon''.

In 2014, ''Crash Course'' announced a partnership with [[PBS Digital Studios]]. The partnership will introduce Benzine and Plait, who will host ''U.S. Government and Politics'', and ''Astronomy'', respectively.&lt;ref name="PBS partnership"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn|url=http://recode.net/2014/11/06/vlogbrothers-bring-crash-course-videos-to-pbs-digital-studios/|title=Vlogbrothers Bring "Crash Course" Videos to PBS Digital Studios|publisher=''Recode''|date=23 January 2017|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hank Green also announced he will be hosting an ''Anatomy &amp;'' ''Physiology'' series, and that another host will host an ''Economics'' series, as John takes a year-long break from the series.&lt;ref name="PBS partnership" /&gt;

== Arts courses ==
Some courses, presented by neither Hank nor John Green have been added to the ''Crash Course'' curriculum since it first began in 2012.

===Games===
On March 25, 2016, the ''Crash Course'' YouTube channel uploaded a two-minute preview for ''Crash Course Games''. It covers the history of games and several types of games, including board games, video games, card games, role-playing games, sports, and more. The series was hosted by Andre Meadows and premiered April 1, 2016.

===Film===
On April 6, 2017, a preview for ''Crash Course Film'' was uploaded. The series consists of three segments: ''[[History of film|Film History]]'' hosted by Craig Benzine, ''[[Filmmaking|Film Production]]'' hosted by [[Lily Gladstone]], and ''[[Film criticism|Film Criticism]]'' hosted by [[Michael Aranda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBuf30fCahI&amp;t=83s|title=Jellyfish|website=WhatImDoingRightNow|publisher=YouTube|last1=Aranda|first1=Michael|accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Film History'' covers the invention of cinema technology, the evolution of film language, and trends in filmmaking. ''Film Production'' covers the process of filmmaking and the roles of key crew members. ''Film Criticism'' analyzes titles including ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', ''[[Selma (film)|Selma]]'', ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', ''[[Moonlight (2016 film)|Moonlight]]'', and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=John and Hank|title=Awesome Sox Club, Pizzamas, PodCon Scholarship, and More!|work=Hank and John's Newsletter|publisher=info@nerdfighteria.com|date=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theater===
On February 2, 2018, a preview for ''Crash Course Theater and Drama'' was uploaded. The first episode was uploaded on February 9 of the same year. The show was is hosted by Mike Rugnetta, and covers the [[History of theatre|history of theater]] throughout different cultures and time periods.

==Humanities courses==
John Green, one half of the VlogBrothers, began his ''Crash Course'' series on January 26, 2012, with ''World History''. As a collective, John has referred to the courses he teaches as "Humanities."&lt;ref name="lit2"&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Green|first=John|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS4jk5kavy4|title=A Long and Difficult Journey, or The Odyssey: Crash Course Literature 201|publisher=YouTube|work=Crash Course Literature 2|date=February 27, 2014|accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of a partnership with [[PBS Digital Studios]], as well as John's decision to take a break from ''Crash Course'' in 2015, new hosts have been introduced to host the humanities courses: Craig Benzine (''Government''), Adriene Hill and Jacob Clifford (''Economics''), and Andre Meadows (''Games'').

Hank's sixth series, ''Philosophy'', is also a humanities course, although it is produced by the team in Missoula who have traditionally produced the science series.

===World History===
[[File:John Green (7478311734).jpg|left|thumb|Author [[John Green (author)|John Green]], co-creator of ''Crash Course'' and host of ''World History'', ''Literature'', and ''U.S. History''.]]
''Crash Course [[World history|World History]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Higgins|first=Chris|url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/116500|title=John Green's Crash Course in World History|publisher=''mental_floss''|date=February 9, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first series launched on the ''Crash Course'' channel, running from January 26 to November 5, 2012.

On January 26, 2012, the series launched with "The [[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]]" and a new episode aired on [[YouTube]] every Thursday. Throughout an episode, Green, the show's host and executive producer, elaborates on the topic presented at the beginning of the video. Raoul Meyer, an [[Advanced Placement|AP]] World History teacher and Green's former teacher at [[Indian Springs School]], writes the show, with revisions and additions by Green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.cgps.org/articles/history-teacher-discovers-talent-educational-web-writer|title=History Teacher Discovers Talent As Educational Web Writer|last=|first=|date=November 5, 2013|website=|publisher=''Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222165217/http://my.cgps.org/articles/history-teacher-discovers-talent-educational-web-writer|archive-date=February 22, 2014|dead-url=|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Crash Course World History'' features recurring segments such as "The Open Letter," where Green reads an open letter to a historical figure, period, item, or concept. Occasionally Green converses with a naïve, younger version of himself whom he calls "Me from the past"; this character usually has naïve or obvious questions or statements about the topic.&lt;ref name="newyorkerteenwhisperer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cicconet|first=Marcelo|url=http://nyunews.com/2013/04/07/cicconet-13/|title=YouTube not just a site for entertainment, but education|publisher=''Washington Square News''|date=April 7, 2013|accessdate=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A running joke is that the [[Mongols]] are a major exception to most sweeping generalizations in world history. Mentions of this fact cue the "Mongoltage" (a portmanteau of "Mongol" and "montage"), which shows a drawing of Mongols shouting "We're an Exception!" followed by a three-second clip of a scene from the 1963 film ''[[Hercules Against the Mongols]]'' depicting a village raid.

In ''Crash Course World History'', Green frequently encourages his viewers to avoid looking at history through [[Eurocentric]] or "Great Man" lenses, but to be conscious of a broader historical context. ''Crash Course World History'', filmed in [[Indianapolis]], has a broad following, having attracted millions of viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Jeffrey R.|url=https://chronicle.com/article/Welcome-to-Star-Scholar-U/135522/|title=Welcome to Star Scholar U., Where a Personal Brand Is the Credential|publisher=''The Chronicle of Higher Education''|date=November 5, 2012|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a particular appeal to American students taking the AP World History class and exam; many students and teachers use the videos to supplement their courses.&lt;ref name="Coolforschool"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|url=https://gigaom.com/2012/02/01/youtube-education-channels/|title=Cool for school: Education is a big hit on YouTube|publisher=''GigaOM''|date=February 1, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jaworski|first=Michelle|url=http://www.dailydot.com/society/youtube-education-john-green-pbs-idea-channel/|title=How YouTube is revolutionizing education|publisher=''The Daily Dot''|date=July 10, 2012|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalonews.com/life-arts/next/youtubes-educational-side-20141030|title=YouTube's educational side|last=Quinn|first=Kate|date=October 30, 2014|website=|publisher=''The Buffalo News''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305224837/http://www.buffalonews.com/life-arts/next/youtubes-educational-side-20141030|archive-date=March 5, 2016|dead-url=|accessdate=November 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various episodes were featured in online news publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tepper|first=Allegra|url=http://mashable.com/2012/07/24/youtube-tough-topics/#gallery/10-youtube-videos-that-explain-complicated-stuff/520c827197b2f866a700038b|title=These 10 Videos Turn Tough Topics Into Child's Play - 4.

After 42 episodes, ''World History'' concluded on November 9, 2012. On June 27, 2014, in a video preview, John Green announced ''World History'' would return for a second season, lasting 30 episodes.&lt;ref name="WHS2preview"&gt;{{cite AV media|last1=Green|first1=John|title=World History, Year 2 Preview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKj4cr2C-3o|publisher=Crash Course|accessdate=June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the second season ended on Apr 4, 2015. He made a few predictions about the future and also quoted at his last sentence: "Also, thanks for watching this series. It has been amazingly fun to create, and we appreciate all of you."&lt;ref name="WHS2eps30"&gt;{{cite AV media|last1=Green|first1=John|title=Democracy, Authoritarian Capitalism, and China: Crash Course World History 230|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7dTDjRnBqU|publisher=Crash Course|accessdate=Apr 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, an [[Arabic]]-language edition of ''World History'', hosted by Yasser Abumuailek, launched. It is produced by [[Deutsche Welle]] and hosted on their Arabic YouTube channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=John|title=Really excited about our partnership with @DeutscheWelle on Crash Course in Arabic.|url=https://twitter.com/johngreen/status/954407760619278337|website=Twitter|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
John's second series is ''Crash Course'' ''[[Literature]]'', which first aired as an eight-episode miniseries, from November 15, 2012. Works that have been covered include ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', and [[Emily Dickinson]]'s poetry.

In February 2014, it was announced John Green would follow his ''U.S. History'' series with ''Crash Course'' ''Literature 2''.&lt;ref name="CCUSH47" /&gt; This second season began on February 27, 2014, and ran for 16 episodes, covering ancient works such as ''[[The Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]]'' and novels like ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', ''[[Frankenstein]]'', and ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]''.

In January 2016, John announced that a third season of ''Crash Course Literature'' would air in the summer. This season will cover ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', ''[[Invisible Man]]'', ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]'', ''[[Sula (novel)|Sula]]'', ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'' as well as some [[Shakespeare's sonnets|Shakespearean sonnets]].

On April 4, 2017 [[John Green (author)|John Green]] revealed in a VlogBrothers video that ''Literature'' will be returning for a fourth series in Fall 2017; he mentioned ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by George Orwell as a possible book to be covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=John|title=Why I Won't Run For Office (vlog)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jer0nvzxJHs&amp;list=WL&amp;index=30|website=vlogbrothers|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 22 of that year, at [[VidCon]], the full list for the fourth season was announced: ''1984'', ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]'', ''[[Candide]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'', ''[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]'', and ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=John|title=New series of Crash Course Lit filming this summer!|url=https://twitter.com/johngreen/status/877930894186602496|website=twitter.com/johngreen|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=22 Jun 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the January 24, 2013, finale of the first season of ''Crash Course Literature'', John Green announced that it would be followed by ''Crash Course [[History of the United States|U.S. History]]'', beginning the following week on January 31, 2013 with "The Black Legend, Native Americans, and Spaniards." Following in the tone set by ''World History'', Green puts an emphasis on maintaining an open and non-Western view of American History. A new segment called the "Mystery Document" replaces the "Open Letter"; Green takes a manuscript from the fireplace's secret compartment and reads it aloud, then must guess its author and the source work it is excerpted from. If he is incorrect, he is punished by a [[Joy buzzer|shock pen]]. Whilst the Mongoltage is largely absent, the "Libertage," photos associated with America overtop an American flag with an electric guitar sound effect opening and ending with an explosion, appears whenever America's great national pride is referenced. The series ended on February 6, 2014.&lt;ref name="CCUSH47"&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Green|first=John|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUfh2ebjLOg|title=Obamanation: Crash Course US History #47|publisher=YouTube|work=Crash Course|date=February 6, 2014|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with ''World History'', ''Crash Course U.S. History'' is written by Raoul Meyer.

===U.S. Government and Politics===
As part of the partnership with [[PBS Digital Studios]], [[Craig Benzine]], known on YouTube as [[WheezyWaiter]], was brought in to host the ''U.S. Government and Politics'' series.&lt;ref name="PBSpartnership"&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Green|first=Hank|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK4kBNdOAoc|title=New Crash Course and Pizzamas!|publisher=''YouTube''|work=VlogBrothers|date=November 7, 2014|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Benzine said that the course will provide an overview of how the [[government of the United States]] is supposed to function, and how it actually does function. He also said that the course will teach about "the branches of government, [[Politics of the United States|politics]], elections, political parties, pizza parties, and much, much more."

The series began on January 23, 2015, and ended on March 4, 2016.

===Economics===
In Hank's November 2014 announcement of the PBS partnership and the new series of ''Crash Course'' in 2015, he mentioned that a ''Crash Course [[Economics]]'' was in the works, but that it was not yet known who would present it.&lt;ref name="PBSpartnership" /&gt; In February 2015, John announced that reporter Adriene Hill and high school teacher Jacob Clifford will host,&lt;ref name="CCIPE"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F0qH0EEBfo|title = Crash Course Intellectual Property and Economics!|date = February 18, 2015|accessdate = February 23, 2015|website = YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in July 2015, a preview video was released on the ''Crash Course'' channel. The series was launched on July 8, 2015, and finished on June 9th, 2016.

===Philosophy===
On January 18, 2016, Hank Green announced he would be hosting a new series about [[philosophy]] in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Green|first=Hank|title=Crash Course Philosophy Preview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNYJQaZUDrI|work=Crash Course|publisher=YouTube|date=January 18, 2016|accessdate=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 8th, the first philosophy episode was released. ''Philosophy'' is the first course to have a corporate sponsor; [[Squarespace]] will present each episode. The series was launched February 8, 2016.  The series is produced by the science-series team in Missoula, Montana, as the series focuses on issues in [[logic]] and the [[philosophy of science]]. The series ended on February 13, 2017.

===Human Geography===
On October 12, 2016, the ''Crash Course'' YouTube channel uploaded a 90-second preview for ''Crash Course Human Geography''. The course discusses what [[Human geography|Human Geography]] isn't, and what it is, and will discuss humans in the context of their world. The series is hosted by Miriam Nielsen.

A premiere episode was posted on October 19, 2016, and a second the following week; however, both were removed on October 27. John Green posted to Twitter that "...we got important things wrong. We'll rework the series... And we'll bring a better series to you in a few months."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=John|title=We're taking down the first two Crash Course Human Geography videos...|url=https://twitter.com/johngreen/status/791736055871442944|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 2016, John Green explained that the videos were removed due to "factual mistakes as well as too strident a tone." Green said it was caused by a rushed production stemming from staff and budgeting issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=John|title=A Note on CC Human Geography|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvFStAP7Uko|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Reddit]] AMA in October 2017, John Green indicated the course may not return for some time, stating "we don't feel like we've cracked it yet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=John|title=I'm John Green, author of The Fault in Our Stars and Turtles All the Way Down. I'm in a bus for the next eight hours.

==Science courses==
[[File:Hank Green speaking at VidCon 2012 in Anaheim, California.jpg|thumb|Hank Green (7492551432)|[[Hank Green]], co-creator of ''Crash Course'', has hosted several science courses on the series.]] 
[[File:Philip Plait 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Phil Plait]], the host of the ''Astronomy'' series.]]
Hank Green began his ''Crash Course'' series with ''Biology'', on January 30, 2012. John referred to Hank's series as "the science stuff" counterpart to his humanities courses.&lt;ref name="lit2" /&gt; As part of the partnership with [[PBS Digital Studios]], additional hosts have been brought in to host recent series: Phil Plait (''Astronomy''), and Shini Somara (''Physics'').

A 2017 series, ''Computer Science'', is also a science course, although it is produced by the team in Indianapolis who have traditionally produced the humanities series.

===Biology===
Hank Green's first series, ''Crash Course [[Biology]]'', launched on January 30, 2012 with "That's Why Carbon Is a Tramp," and a new episode aired on YouTube every Monday until October 22, 2012. The series used humor to blend entertainment into its educational content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grantham|first=Nick|url=http://www.fractuslearning.com/2012/02/29/brothers-history-biology/|title=Meet Two Brothers Who Bring Biology And History To Life|publisher=''Fractus Learning''|date=February 29, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recurring segment on the program is titled "Biolo-graphy," in which Green relays a short [[biography]] of a person who is usually associated with the topic of the overall episode. For the benefit of uncertain viewers, Hank Green links YouTube annotations to every specific subtopic he explains in the video at the conclusion of the episode (the annotations replay the video starting from the particular annotation the viewer selects). In July 2012, a ''Crash Course Biology'' episode discussing [[comparative anatomy]] was featured on a [[Mashable]] article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tepper|first=Allegra|url=http://mashable.com/2012/07/24/youtube-tough-topics/#gallery/10-youtube-videos-that-explain-complicated-stuff/520c827197b2f866a700038a|title=These 10 Videos Turn Tough Topic Into Child's Play - 3.

'''''{{spell-nv|Diné Bahaneʼ}}''''' ({{lang-nv|"Story of the People"}}), the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] [[creation myth]], describes the prehistoric emergence of the Navajo, and centers on the area known as the [[Dinétah]], the traditional [[homeland]] of the Navajo.
This story forms the basis for the traditional Navajo way of life. The basic outline of {{spell-nv|Diné Bahaneʼ}} begins with the '''''{{spell-nv|Niłchʼi Diyin}}''''' (Holy Wind) being created, the [[mist]]s of [[light]]s which arose through the darkness to animate and bring purpose to the four '''''{{spell-nv|Diyin Dineʼé}}''''' (Holy People), supernatural and sacred in the different three lower worlds. All these things were spiritually created in the time before the [[Earth]] existed and the physical aspect of humans did not exist yet, but the spiritual did.

The First or Dark World, '''''{{spell-nv|Niʼ Hodiłhił}}''''', was small and centered on an island floating in the middle of four seas. The inhabitants of the first world were the four {{spell-nv|Diyin Dineʼé}}, the two [[Coyote (Navajo mythology)|Coyotes]], the four rulers of the four seas, mist beings and various [[insect]] and bat people, the latter being the Air-Spirit People. The supernatural beings First Woman and First Man came into existence here and met for the first time after seeing each other's fire. The various beings started fighting with one another and departed by flying out an opening in the east.

They journeyed to the Second or Blue World, '''''{{spell-nv|Niʼ Hodootłʼizh}}''''', which was inhabited by various blue-gray furred mammals and various birds, including blue swallows. The beings from the First World offended Swallow Chief, {{spell-nv|Táshchózhii}}, and they were asked to leave. First Man created a wand of jet and other materials to allow the people to walk upon it up into the next world through an opening in the south.

In the Third or Yellow World, '''''{{spell-nv|Niʼ Hałtsooí}}''''', there were two rivers that formed a cross and the Sacred Mountains but there was still no sun. More animal people lived here too. This time it was not discord among the people that drove them away but a [[Deluge myth|great flood]] caused by {{spell-nv|Tééhoołtsódii}} when Coyote stole her two children.

When the people arrived in the Fourth or White World, '''''{{spell-nv|Niʼ Hodisxǫs}}''''', it was covered in water and there were monsters ({{spell-nv|naayééʼ}}) living here. The Sacred Mountains were re-formed from soil taken from the original mountains in the Second World. First Man, First Woman, and the Holy People created the sun, moon, seasons, and stars. It was here that true death came into existence via Coyote tossing a stone into a lake and declaring that if it sank then the dead would go back to the previous world.

The first human born in the Fourth World is {{spell-nv|[[Yoołgai Asdzáá]]}} who matures into Asdzáá Naadleehí, in turn, gives birth to the Hero Twins called {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}} and {{spell-nv|Tóbájíshchíní}}. The twins have many adventures in which they helped to rid the world of various monsters. Multiple batches of modern humans were created a number of times in the Fourth World and the {{spell-nv|Diyin Dineʼé}} gave them ceremonies which are still practiced today.

== The First World ==
Of a time long ago these things are said.
The first world was small, and black as soot.
In the middle of the four seas there was an island floating in the mist.
On the island grew a pine tree.

Dark ants dwelt there.
Red ants dwelled there.
Dragonflies dwelled there.
Yellow beetles dwelled there.
Hard beetles dwelled there.
Stone-carrier beetles dwelled there.
Black beetles dwelled there.
Coyote-dung beetles dwelled there.
Bats dwelled there.
Whitefaced beetles dwelled there.
Locusts dwelled there.
White locusts dwelled there.

These were the twelve groups of the {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi Dineʼé}}, the Air-Spirit People, who lived in the First World.&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, Paul G. (1984), Diné Bahane', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the floating island were four seas. Each sea was ruled by a being. In the sea to the East dwelled {{spell-nv|Tééhoołtsódii}}, Big Water Creature, The One Who Grabs Things in the Water. In the sea to the south lived {{spell-nv|Táłtłʼááh álééh}}, [[Great Blue Heron|Blue Heron]]. In the sea to the west dwelled {{spell-nv|Chʼał}}, [[Frog]]. In the ocean to the north dwelled {{spell-nv|Iiʼniʼ Jiłgaii}}, Winter Thunder.

Above each sea appeared a cloud. There was a black cloud, a white cloud, a blue cloud, and a yellow cloud. The Black Cloud contained the Female spirit of Life. The White Cloud contained the Male spirit of Dawn.

The Black Cloud and the White Cloud came together in the East, and the wind from the clouds blew. From the breath of wind, First Man, {{spell-nv|Áłtsé Hastiin}}, was formed and with him the white corn, {{spell-nv|Kóhonotʼíinii}}, perfect in shape, with kernels covering the whole ear. Crystal, symbol of the mind and clear seeing, was with him.

The Blue Cloud and the Yellow Cloud came together in the West, and a wind from the clouds blew. From the breath of wind, First Woman, {{spell-nv|Áłtsé Asdzą́ą́}}, was formed, and with her the yellow corn, perfect in shape, with kernels covering the whole ear. White shell, and turquoise, and yucca were there with her.[[File:Frontispiece Smithsonian Bulletin163.jpg|400px|thumb|alt=Colorized b&amp;w image from O'Bryan 1936 text|First Man between Black Cloud and White Cloud, and First Woman between Blue Cloud and Yellow Cloud]]

First Man made a fire with his crystal. Its light was the mind's first awakening. First Woman made a fire with her turquoise. They saw each other's light in the distance.

When the Blue Cloud and the Yellow Cloud rose high in the sky, First Woman saw the light of First Man's fire, and she went out to find it. Three times she was unsuccessful. The fourth time she found the home of First Man. "I wondered what this thing could be," she said. "I saw you walking and wondered why you did not come," First Man said. "Why do you not come with your fire, and we will live together."  First Woman agreed to this. So instead of the man going to the woman, as is the custom now, the woman went to live with the man.&lt;ref name="Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, p. 3"&gt;Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another person, {{spell-nv|Mąʼiitoʼí Áłchíní}}, Great [[Coyote]], was formed in the water. He told First Man and First Woman that he had been hatched from an egg, and knew all that was under the water and all that was in the skies. First Man believed him. Then a second coyote, {{spell-nv|Áłtsé Hashké}}, First Angry, appeared. He said to the three, "You believe that you were the first persons. You are mistaken. I was living when you were formed."  First Angry brought witchcraft into the world.&lt;ref name="Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, p. 3"/&gt;

The Air-Spirit People became jealous of one another and began to fight. The rulers of the four seas, Blue Heron, Frog, White Thunder, and Big Water Creature could stand it no more, and told the beings of the island that they must all leave this world. Some climbed and some flew until they came to an opening in the sky. They crawled through it and into the Second World.

==The Second World==
First Man, First Woman, the Great-Coyote-Who-Was-Formed-in-the-Water, and the Coyote First Angry, followed by all the others, climbed up from the Dark World to the Second or Blue World.

They found a number of people already living there: bluebirds, blue hawks, bluejays, blue herons, and all the blue furred beings. The powerful [[swallow]] people lived there also. They lived in blue houses, scattered across a broad, blue plain. The swallow people said to the Air-Spirit People, "You are welcome here among us." And for twenty-three days they all lived together in harmony. But on the night of the twenty-fourth day, one of the Air-Spirit People approached the wife of the swallow chief and wished to sleep with her.&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, 1984, p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning the Swallow Chief, {{spell-nv|Táshchozhii}}, said to the newcomers, "We welcomed you here among us. We treated you as kin. Yet this is how you return our kindness. Now you must leave this world."

The Air-Spirit people wandered upward looking for a way into the next world. {{spell-nv|Niłchʼi}}, The [[Wind]], called to them from the South. They followed him and found a slit in the sky. First Man created a wand of jet and other materials and the Air-Spirit people flew or walked upon it up into the next world. One by one they passed through to the other side.

==The Third World&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod (1984) places most of these events in the Fourth World&lt;/ref&gt;==
The bluebird had joined the Air-Spirit People and was the first to reach the Third or Yellow World. After him came the First Four and all the others.

The great Female River crossed this land from north to south. The great Male River crossed the land from east to west. The rivers flowed through one another in the middle, and the name of this place is {{spell-nv|Tó Ałnáosdlį́į́}}, Crossing of the Waters.

In the Yellow World were six mountains. In the East was {{spell-nv|[[Blanca Peak|Sisnaajiní]]}}, Dawn, or White Shell Mountain. In the South was {{spell-nv|[[Mount Taylor (New Mexico)|Tsoodził]]}}, Blue Bead, or Turquoise Mountain. To the West was {{spell-nv|[[San Francisco Peaks|Dookʼoʼoosłííd]]}}, Abalone Shell Mountain. In the North was {{spell-nv|[[Hesperus Mountain (Colorado)|Dibé Nitsaa]]}}, Big Sheep Mountain. Near the Center of the Yellow World was {{spell-nv|Dził Náʼoodiłii}}, Soft Goods or Banded Rock Mountain. And near it, East of center, there was {{spell-nv|Chʼóolʼį́ʼí}}, Precious Stones, or Great Spruce Mountain.

Holy People lived on the mountains. They were immortal, and could travel by following the path of the rainbow and the rays of the sun. One was '''{{spell-nv|Haashchʼééłtiʼí}}, Talking God'''. His body was white. One was '''{{spell-nv|Tó Neinilí}}, Water Sprinkler'''. He was blue. One was '''{{spell-nv|Haashchʼééʼooghaan}}, House God'''. His body was yellow. One was {{spell-nv|Haashchʼééshzhiní}}, [[Black God (Navajo mythology)|Black God]], the god of fire. Beyond them to the east lived Turquoise Boy, who was a {{spell-nv|[[Nádleehi]]|Nádleeh}}, neither male nor female, who guarded the great male reed.  And far to the West, on Abalone Shell Mountain, lived {{spell-nv|Yoołgaii Asdzą́ą́}} White Shell Girl, also a {{spell-nv|Nádleeh}}.  With her was the big female reed, which grew at the water's edge with no tassel. [[File:Sandpainting of Dine'tah.jpg|400px|thumb|alt=Colorized b&amp;w image from O'Bryan 1936 text|Drawing by Sam Ahkeak of sandpainting of Dinétah, the Navajo Homeland created by ceremonial leaders near Shiprock around 1930.]]

In the autumn, the four Holy People called to First Man and First Woman, and visited them, but they did not speak. Four days in a row they visited. On the fourth day, Black God said, "You must cleanse yourselves and we will return in twelve days."

First Man and First Woman bathed carefully and dried themselves with corn meal. They listened and waited. On the twelfth day the four Holy People returned. Water Sprinkler and Black God carried a sacred buckskin. Talking God carried two perfect ears of corn, with their points completely covered with kernels. One ear of corn was white, the male corn belonging to First Man. The other ear was yellow, the female corn belonging to First Woman. The gods placed one buckskin on the ground facing west, and on it they placed the two ears of corn with their tips pointing east. Under the white ear they put the feather of a white eagle. Under the yellow ear they put the feather of a yellow eagle. They told the people to stand at a distance so that the wind could enter.

The White Wind, {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi Łigai}} blew between the buckskins, and while the wind blew, each of the Holy People walked four times around them, and the feathers were seen to move. In this way, they transformed First Man and First Woman from spirit people into human beings, with great powers.&lt;ref&gt;In Zolbrod's account, this ceremony is the birth of First Man and First Woman in the Fourth World. In most other accounts, however (including that of Old Man Buffalo Grass in 1928), First Man and First Woman are present in each of the first three worlds.&lt;/ref&gt; "Now," the Holy People said, "live here as husband and wife."

At the end of four days, First Woman gave birth to twins. They were neither male nor female, but {{spell-nv|Nádleeh}}. Four days later a second set of twins was born, one male and one female. After twenty days a total of five pairs of twins had been born, half of them male and half of them female. Almost at once they were full grown. The Holy People took each set of twins to their home on the East Mountain and taught them how to wear masks and pray, and then returned them to their parents. Eight winters passed, and during that time the twins found mates with the Mirage People. Many people came into being.

===Spider Man, Spider Woman and Weaving===
&lt;!--[[String figure#See also]] links directly here.--&gt;
Near {{spell-nv|Tó Ałnáosdlį́į́}}, Crossing of the Waters, lived Spider Man and Spider Woman. They knew how to weave the fibers of cotton and hemp and other plants. First Woman asked Spider Man and Spider Woman to teach people how to weave the fibers of plants so they would not have to depend on animal skins for clothing.&lt;ref&gt;This story is from Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, pp. 37-38&lt;/ref&gt;  Cotton seeds were planted, and the cotton was gathered. Spider Man taught the people to shape a little wheel, 3 or 4&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter, and put a slender stick through it to spin the cotton. First Woman said, "You must spin towards your person, not away, as you wish to have the beautiful goods come to you. If you spin away from you, the goods will depart from you." Spider Man named the spindle "{{spell-nv|yódí yił yaʼhote}}," meaning "turning around with the beautiful goods."  Spider Woman said, "No, it shall be called {{spell-nv|nto is yił yaʼhote}}, turning around with the mixed chips."

After they had spun the thread they rolled it into good-sized balls, and brought straight poles and tied them to make a rectangular frame. Spider Man wound the thread on two of the poles from east to west, over and under the poles. Then Spider Man said that the ball of thread should be called "{{spell-nv|yódí yił nasmas aghaaʼ}}," meaning "rolling with the beautiful goods." Spider Woman said, "No, it shall be called {{spell-nv|ntsilí yił nasmas aghaaʼ}}, rolling with the mixed chips."

After the loom was finished the cross poles were erected and other poles placed on the ground to hold the loom frame solidly, and the loom was stretched into place. Spider Man said, "It shall be called {{spell-nv|yótí ilth na daiʼdi}}, raising with the beautiful goods." Spider Woman said, "No, it shall be called {{spell-nv|niltłʼiz na daiʼdi}}, raising with the mixed chips."

There was a notched stick running across, with a notch holding every other thread. Spider Man said, "It will be called {{spell-nv|yódí bił nesłon}}, looping with the beautiful goods." Spider Woman said, "No, it shall be called {{spell-nv|niltłʼliz bił nesłon}}, looping with the mixed chips." Then they used a narrow stick about two and a half feet long, and wound the yarn or thread over it, and where there is no design they ran it along.  That was given the same name as the ball of thread.  They used the wide flat stick for tapping down the thread.  Spider Man said, "It shall be called {{spell-nv|yódí naʼygolte}};" but Spider Woman said, "It shall be called {{spell-nv|niltłʼiz naʼygolte}}."

Spider Man then said, "Now you know all that I have named for you. It is yours to work with and to use following your own wishes. But from now on when a baby girl is born to your tribe you shall go and find a spider web woven at the mouth of some hole; you must take it and rub it on the baby's hand and arm. Thus, when she grows up she will weave, and her fingers and arms will not tire from the weaving."

===The Separation of Men and Women===
One day First Man brought home a fine deer that he had killed.  First Woman said, "I thank my vagina for this deer."  First Man demanded to know what she meant.  "I mean that you bring me food because you wish to have sex with me," she said.  "But we women could live happily without men.  We are the ones who gather the food and till the fields.  We have no need of men."  First Man grew angry and called all the men together.  "The women think they can live without us," he told them.  "Let us see if that is true."&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, 1984, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The men and the two hermaphrodite twins crossed the river to the north bank carrying the grinding stones and bowls and baskets that the hermaphrodite twins had made, and the axes and hoes that the men had invented.  The women bared themselves along the bank of the river and called out to the men, saying "See what you are missing?"
There were occasionally men and women who so longed after the other that some jumped into the river that separated them in a vain attempt to reunite with their loved ones. Unfortunately the currents of the river were too strong and the swimmers were washed down the river, never to be seen again.

For four years the men and the women lived apart.  During this time the food that the women harvested became less, because they had no tools, while the men grew more and more food.  But each group longed for the other.  The women sought to satisfy themselves with bones and feathers and long stones.  The men tried to relieve their longing with the fresh meat of animals.  One man, {{spell-nv|Kʼíídeesdizí}}, tried to satisfy himself using the liver of a deer.  Owl called out to him to stop.  "This is wrong," Owl said. "No good can come of this separation. You must bring the men and the women together again." As it turns out Owl was right. From the women who had sought to satisfy themselves with foreign objects, monsters were born out of this. The monsters would go on the terrorize the people wherever they roamed.  

{{spell-nv|Kʼíídeesdizí}} spoke to the other men.  Finally they all spoke to First Man.  First Man called across the river to First Woman, and asked, "Do you still think you can live alone?"  "I no longer believe I can," she responded.  "I am sorry I let the things you said make me angry," First Man said.  And then the men sent a raft to the women's side of the river to bring the women across.  The men and women bathed and dried their bodies with corn meal, and remained apart until nightfall.  Then they would resume their lives together.

===Big Water Creature and the Great Flood===
But a mother and her two daughters had been in the fields and had not seen the raft.  Now it was dark, and they saw that all of the women had crossed the river to the men's side.  They began to swim across.  But {{spell-nv|Tééhoołtsódii}}, Big Water Creature, grabbed the two daughters and dragged them to her home under the water.  For three days and three nights, the people searched the river for the girls, but they could not find them.

On the morning of the fourth day, Talking God and Water Sprinkler appeared with a large bowl of white shell and a large bowl of blue shell.  The people gathered around them.  They placed the bowls at the water's edge, and started to spin them.  The spinning bowls created an opening in the water which led downward to a large house with four rooms.  First Man and First Woman traveled down the passage and into the house, and behind them crept the Coyote named First Angry.  In the north room of the house, they found Big Water Creature asleep in a chair.  Her own two children were there, and also the two missing daughters.  First Man and First Woman took the hands of the girls and led them back through the passage and on to the bank.  Behind them, Coyote carried the two children of Big Water Creature, wrapped in his big skin coat with white fur lining.&lt;ref&gt;According to Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee (p. 8), First Woman asked the Coyote known as First Angry to steal the children of Big Water Creature&lt;/ref&gt;  There was great celebrating because the lost girls were returned.

The next morning, animals began running past the village from the east.  Deer ran by, and turkeys, and antelopes, and squirrels.  For three days, animals ran past, fleeing from something.  On the morning of the fourth day, the people sent locusts flying to the east to find out what was happening.  The locusts returned and told that a great wall of water was coming from the east, and a tide of water from the north and from the south.  The people ran to the top of the mountain {{spell-nv|Sisnaajiní}}.  First Man ran to each of the other Sacred Mountains, took dirt from each, and summoned the Holy People, and returned to {{spell-nv|Sisnaajiní}}. Turquoise Boy came bearing the great Male Reed, and First Man planted it in the top of the mountain.  All the people began to blow on the reed, and it began to grow and grow until it reached the canopy of the sky.  Woodpecker hollowed out a passage inside the reed, and the people and Turquoise Boy and the four Holy People all began to climb up until they came out in the Fourth World.

==The Fourth World&lt;ref&gt;This account follows Ethelou Yazzie (1971) ''Navajo History'' in associating these events with the Fourth World. Both Zolbrod (1984) and Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee (1928) place these events in a Fifth World. Yazzie's structure avoids having to describe one world in which essentially no important events are recorded, and its sponsorship by the Navajo Curriculum Center in Chinle Arizona as an instructional text for Navajo students supports the use of this version.&lt;/ref&gt;==
After the people had all emerged into the Fourth, or White World, they saw the water continuing to rise in the Third World beneath them. Big Water Creature pushed her head through the opening in the reed. Her curly hair floated on the water, and lightning flashed from her black horn and her yellow horn. First Man asked Big Water Creature why she had come. She said nothing. But the Coyote named First Angry came forward wearing his skin coat. He said "Perhaps it is because of this," and drew the two babies from under his coat. Turquoise Boy took a basket and filled it with turquoise. On top of the turquoise he placed the blue pollen from blue flowers and yellow pollen from the corn, and pollen from water flags, and on top of these he placed the crystal, which is river pollen.&lt;ref&gt;O'Bryan's 1928 transcription of Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  This basket he gave to Coyote, who put it between the horns of the Big Water Creature, and on the basket he placed the two children. The Big Water Creature disappeared down into the reed, and the water with her.

They saw that they were on an island in the middle of a bubbling lake,&lt;ref&gt;Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee (p. 12) associates the place of emergence with Pagosa Springs, Colorado&lt;/ref&gt; surrounded by high cliffs.&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;  At first the people could not find a way to get across the water to the shore.  They called on Water Sprinkler to help them.  He had brought four great stones with him from the Third World.  He threw one to the east.  When it hit the cliff wall, it broke a hole through it, and water began to flow out of the lake.  He threw a stone to the south. He threw one to the west.  And to the north he threw one.  Each stone created a hole in the cliff, and the water of the lake became lower.  A lane now connected the island to the shore to the east, but it was deep with mud.  The people called on {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi Dilkǫǫh}}, Smooth Wind, to help them.  He blew steadily for a long time, and finally the people were able to leave the island.

First Man and First Woman built a hogan to live in. It was not like a hogan of today. First Man dug a shallow pit in the earth and placed poles in it.  For the main poles he used two parts of the Black Bow, {{spell-nv|Ałtį́į́ʼ Diłhił}}.  One pole he cut from the Male Reed.  One pole he cut from the Female Reed.  The structure was covered with earth and grass.  First Woman ground white corn and they powdered the poles and sprinkled corn meal inside the dwelling from East to West. First Man said, "May my home be sacred and beautiful, and may the days be beautiful and plenty." This was the first hogan-raising ceremony.

===Creation of Sun and Moon===
Inside, First Man lay with his head to the East, and First Woman lay with her head to the West. Their thoughts mingled, and those thoughts were sacred. They began to plan for the time that was to come, and how people would live on the earth. Great Coyote-Who-Was-Formed-in-the-Water came in to help them plan. Together, they planned that there should be a sun, a moon, and day and night.  They decided to keep the other Coyote, First Angry, away from their planning, because it was he who had brought unhappiness.

First Man, First Woman, and Great-Coyote-Who-Was-Formed-in-the-Water covered the floor of the hogan with a perfect buckskin.  On the buckskin the placed a perfect round turquoise, larger than the height of a man.  Below the turquoise they placed a great perfect white shell. At that moment the Coyote {{spell-nv|Áłtsé Hashké}}, First Angry, came and asked them what they were doing.  "Nothing," they said.  "So I see," he said.  And he went away.

First Man went looking for {{spell-nv|Haashchʼééshzhiní}}, The Black Yéʼii, known as the Fire God.  First Man found him in a place where there was fire under the earth, and called to him.  He returned to the first hogan with First Man.  First Man and First Woman also summoned the other three Holy People, Water Sprinkler, House God, and Talking God.  Together, they told Turquoise Boy and White Shell Girl that they were creating the sun and the moon.  They asked Turquoise Boy if he would become the sun, and they asked White Shell Girl if she would become the moon.  Again, the Coyote named First Angry came by and asked them what they were doing.  "Nothing," they said.  "So I see," he said, and he went away.

First Man, First Woman, Great Coyote, and the Holy People planned that there would be 12 months.  With each month, the moon would pass from dark to light, and the sun would move to a different path in the sky.  White Shell Girl was given a whistle made from the Female Reed, with 12 holes in it.  Each time she completed her cycle she would blow on the whistle, and a new month would begin. The first month was named {{spell-nv|Ghąąjįʼ}}, Back-to-Back, or Parting of the Seasons.  Today it is called October.  The second month was named {{spell-nv|Níłchʼitsʼósí}}, Time of Slender Winds. The third month was {{spell-nv|Níłchʼitsoh}}, Great Wind. It is the time to begin to tell the sacred stories.  The fourth month, January, was {{spell-nv|Yas Niłtʼees}}, Crusted Snow.  This is the month of many ceremonies, and the time for sacred stories.  February, the fifth month, is {{spell-nv|Atsá Biyáázh}}, Baby Eagle.  After this month, sacred stories must not be told to the young people. The sixth month, {{spell-nv|Wóózhchʼį́į́d}}, is the month of Sudden Spring Storms. Ceremonies are held to bless the fields before seeds are planted. The seventh month was {{spell-nv|Tʼą́ą́chil}}, Little Leaves. May, {{spell-nv|Tʼą́ą́tsoh}}, was the eighth month. Finally they planned {{spell-nv|Yaʼiishjááshchilí}}, When-Few-Seeds-Ripen, {{spell-nv|Jáátsoh}}, Great Seed Ripening, {{spell-nv|Biniʼantʼą́ą́tsʼózí}}, Little Ripening, and finally September, {{spell-nv|Biniʼantʼą́ą́tsoh}}, Harvest Time, when foods are stored for the winter.

Again, the Coyote named First Angry came by and asked what they were doing.  "Nothing," they said.  "So I see," he said, and he went away.

Fire God, the Black Yéʼii, used his fire to heat the turqoise on the buckskin until it became red hot.  Then they asked Turquoise Boy to enter the glowing turquoise.  "If I do that, I must be paid with the lives of the people of the earth, all the human beings, the animals which have four legs, the birds and insects of the air, the fishes and all the people under the water."  And then the White Shell Girl repeated the same thing.  First Woman, First Man, Great Coyote, and the Holy People all agreed.  Then Turquoise Boy entered the glowing Turquoise.  First Man used his crystal to heat the White Shell, and White Shell Girl entered the White Shell.  Four circles were made around the inside of the hogan to complete the ceremony.  In this way, Turquoise Boy became the sun, {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}, The One Who Rules the Day.  And White Shell Girl became the moon, {{spell-nv|Tłʼéhonaaʼéí}}, The One Who Rules the Night.  {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi Haʼaʼaahdę́ęʼgo}}, the East Wind, asked to carry the newly formed sun to his land so that it could begin its journey there.&lt;ref&gt;O'Bryan's 1928 transcription of Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, pp. 19-20; Zolbrod, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coyote named First Angry appeared again.  He said, "I know you have been planning great things.  I demand to know why I was not included in the planning."  First Man and First Woman said nothing.  Coyote said, "You believe that I spoiled your living in the lower worlds, but it is not true. Now I will spoil your plans. The path of the sun and the path of the moon will not return to their beginning after 12 months.  The twelve months of the sun will be 13 months of the moon. Sometimes frost will come early, and sometimes it will remain late.  Sometimes the rains will not come, and you will have to summon the baby of the Big Water Creature to bring water." And he left them.

===The Coming of Death===
Late in the first day, when {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}} was finishing his first journey across the sky, one of the hermaphrodite twins, {{spell-nv|Nádleeh}}, stopped breathing.  Afraid, the people left her alone.  In the morning, the Coyote named First Angry and the people went to find the twin, but {{spell-nv|Nádleeh}} was gone.  One man looked down the reed into the Third World, and there he saw {{spell-nv|Nádleeh}} sitting by the side of the river combing her hair.  He called to his friend, and he looked and also saw her.  The people asked Coyote what to do.  He took a black rock, {{spell-nv|tadzootsé}}, and threw it into {{spell-nv|Tódiłhił}}, the Black Water Lake.  He said that if the rock came up and floated, the spirit of the dead person would return to the Fourth World and there would be no death.  If the rock sank, the spirit would stay in the world below and there would be death. The rock sank, and the people knew then that the twin was dead, and First Man remembered the agreement they had made with the sun.&lt;ref&gt;This version draws upon Yazzie (1971), Zolbrod (1984, pp. 84-85), and Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, pp. 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  Four days later the two witnesses who had looked down on the dead twin also died.  The people learned that it is dangerous to look at the dead. The people were all mad at Coyote for this and gathered around to beat him. Coyote said they could beat him, but first he had something to say. "I threw the rock in the water knowing that it would sink." The people darkly muttered about this to one another, the whole of them deciding that Coyote really did deserve a good beating. But quick thinking Coyote finished his explanation. "Without death the world would soon be overpopulated. The elders would never die and would stay stuck in their infirm bodies. There would be no room for new children. We would run out of food and shelter with so many people to feed and care for." The gathered group was silent for a bit while all of them contemplated Coyote's rationale and found him to be wise and intelligent.

===Stars and Constellations===
First Man, First Woman, Great Coyote, and the Holy People next planned stars for the night sky.&lt;ref&gt;This account draws on Yazzie, 1971; Zolbrod, pp. 92-94; Hastiin Tlotsi Hee, pp. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; They gathered as many pieces of {{spell-nv|tsésǫʼ}}, ''rock-star mica,'' as they could find, and put them on a blanket. Then First Man made a drawing in the dirt to plan the location of all the stars seeking to make the sky like a woven rug, orderly and balanced.  {{spell-nv|Haashchʼééshzhiní}}, Black Yéʼii, placed the {{spell-nv|Sǫʼtsoh}} (North Star). First Man placed the {{spell-nv|Náhookǫs [bikąʼí]}} (Big Dipper) while First Woman put the {{spell-nv|Náhookǫs [baʼáádí]}} (Little Dipper) into the sky. First Man also placed the {{spell-nv|Dilyéhé}}  (Seven Stars, the Pleiades) which Black Yéʼii claimed represented parts of his body. They placed {{spell-nv|Áłtséʼétsoh}}, the Big First One.  They placed {{spell-nv|Áłtséʼétsʼósí}}, Coyote's Feather, or the Slender One (the belt and sword of Orion).  They placed {{spell-nv|Baʼáłchíní}}, the children of {{spell-nv|Dilyéhé}} and {{spell-nv|Áłtséʼétsʼósí}}; and {{spell-nv|Hastiin Sikʼaiʼí}}, The-Old-Man-with Feet Apart; and the Rabbit Tracks, {{spell-nv|Gah Atʼéʼii}}; and {{spell-nv|Yikáí Sidáhí}} Moving-toward-the-Dawn; and {{spell-nv|Náhookǫs Bakąʼí}}, The-Revolving-Male-Warrior-with-His-Bow-and-Arrow; and his wife, {{spell-nv|Náhookǫs Baʼáádí}}, Who-Carries-the-Fire-in-Her-Basket.&lt;ref&gt;O'Bryan (p. 21) shows the relationship of many of these constellations to their European equivalents&lt;/ref&gt; The Coyote named First Angry returned to see what was going on.  He took a piece of rock-star mica and placed it on the sky, and it became {{spell-nv|Mąʼii bizǫʼ}}, known by Bilagáana as Canopus.  He placed another piece in the south, {{spell-nv|Sǫʼ Doo Nidisidí}}, Morning Star. Then Coyote said, "This is too long. I have a better way."  He then snapped the blanket and the rest of the rock-star mica was scattered across the sky.

===The Re-Creation of the Sacred Mountains&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, pp. 86-89; Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee pp. 23-26&lt;/ref&gt;===
{{spell-nv|Áłtsé hastiin}}, First Man, and {{spell-nv|Áłtsé asdzą́ą́}}, First Woman, together with {{spell-nv|Tó Neinilí}}, Water Sprinkler, and {{spell-nv|Haashchʼééshzhiní}}, Black Yéʼii, the god of fire, set out to create the six sacred mountains from dirt that First Man had brought up from each mountain in the third world. They placed them as they had been in the third world.  They re-created {{spell-nv|[[Blanca Peak|Sisnaajiní]]}}, Dawn, or White Shell Mountain, in the East. They decorated it with white shells.  They decorated it with white lightning.  They decorated it with white corn.  They decorated it with dark clouds that make male rain. From stones they had brought they fashioned {{spell-nv|Tséghádiʼnídíinii Ashkii}}, Rock Crystal Boy,&lt;ref&gt;There is little agreement concerning the names of the immortals dwelling on each sacred mountain.  Both Yazzie (1971) and Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee (p. 25) place Yoolgai Ashkii (White Bead Boy) on Sisnaajiní, and he is mentioned in the Mountain Top Chant, recorded by Matthews in 1887&lt;/ref&gt; and Tséghádiʼnídíinii atʼééd, Rock Crystal Girl, to reside there forever.

In the South they re-created {{spell-nv|[[Mount Taylor (New Mexico)|Tsoodził]]}}, Blue Bead, or Turquoise Mountain. They adorned it with turquoise.  They adorned it with dark mist.  They adorned it with animals. They adorned it with light clouds that bring female rain. From two stones they had brought with them they fashioned {{spell-nv|Dootłʼizhii Náyooʼałí Ashkii}}, the Boy Who Is Bringing Back Turquoise, and {{spell-nv|Naadą́ą́ʼ ląʼí Náyooʼáłí Atʼééd}}, the Girl Who Is Bringing Back Many Ears of Corn.  They were created to reside there forever.

To the West they re-created {{spell-nv|[[San Francisco Peaks|Dookʼoʼoosłííd]]}}, Abalone Shell Mountain.  They adorned it with haliotis shell.  They adorned it with animals.  They adorned it with dark clouds that bring the male rain. From material from the Third World they created {{spell-nv|Naadą́ą́łgaii Ashkii}}, the White Corn Boy, and {{spell-nv|Naadą́ą́łtsoii Atʼééd}}, the Yellow Corn Girl.  They were created to reside there forever.

In the North they re-created {{spell-nv|[[Hesperus Mountain (Colorado)|Dibé Nitsaa]]}}, Big Mountain Sheep. They adorned that mountain with black beads.  They adorned it with many plants.  They adorned it with many animals.  They adorned it with the grey mist that brings female rain.  From materials from below, they fashioned {{spell-nv|Tádídíín Ashkii}}, Pollen Boy, and {{spell-nv|Nahachagii Atʼééd}}, Grasshopper Girl.  They were created to reside there forever.

Near the Center they re-created {{spell-nv|Dził Náʼoodiłii}}, Soft Goods or Banded Rock Mountain. They left its summit bare, but they created two beings to reside there.  They were {{spell-nv|Yódí Neidiitsi Ashkii}}, Boy Who Produces Goods, and {{spell-nv|Yódí Neidiitsi Atʼééd}}, Girl Who Produces Goods.

East of center they re-created {{spell-nv|Chʼóolʼį́ʼí}}, Precious Stones, or Great Spruce Mountain.  They decorated it with pollen and the clouds that bring female rain.  On it they created two beings, {{spell-nv|Nitłʼiz Neidiitsi Ashkii}}, the Boy Who Produces Jewels, and {{spell-nv|Nitłʼiz Neidiitsi Atʼééd}}, the Girl Who Produces Jewels, to live there forever.&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod includes a seventh sacred mountain, and Haastiin Tlo'tsi Hee describes three additional mountains, but they are not supported by other sources&lt;/ref&gt;

When all was done, First Man, First Woman, Black Yéʼii and Water Sprinkler returned and taught the people about the sacred mountains.  They taught them that these six mountains were their principal mountains.  From the lower mesa lands they could see them.  Chants were made for them. Finally, a smoke was prepared for the mountains and the chants were sung.

===The Coming of Monsters===
In the Third World, there was a time when men and women had lived apart for a long time.  During that time, some women had used animal horns or long stones or bird feathers for sex.  Now, in the Fourth World, some of those women were pregnant. One woman who had used an antelope horn gave birth to a child with no head.  The people held a council and decided that this baby would be abandoned.  It was left to die in a gully.  But it lived and grew to become {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}}, the Horned Monster.

A woman who had used an eagle's feather for sex gave birth to a round, headless child with feathered shoulders.  A council was held, and it was decided that this baby too should be abandoned.  It was left in an alkali pit.  But it lived, and grew to become {{spell-nv|Tsé Nináhálééh}}, Monster Eagle.&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;  It made its home on ''{{spell-nv|Tséteʼiská}},''&lt;ref name="sp?"&gt;''&lt;u&gt;Note:&lt;/u&gt; the spelling according to modern orthography could not be found and the meaning seems uncertain or lost.''&lt;/ref&gt; a peak beyond La Plata Mountains.&lt;ref name="Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, p. 39"&gt;Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman who had used an elongated stone for sex gave birth to a headless child with hard skin and a pointed neck.  The people met in council and decided that this baby should be abandoned in a fissure in a cliff.  They placed the child and closed the fissure with rocks.  But the child lived and grew to become {{spell-nv|Tsé dah Hódziiłtáłii}}, The Monster Who Kicks People Down the Cliff.&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;  It made its home at a place called ''Knol ghi nee,''&lt;ref name="sp?"/&gt; beyond the Carrizos Mountains.&lt;ref name="Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, p. 39"/&gt;

A woman who had skinned a sour cactus and used it for sex gave birth to twins, headless creatures with no limbs.  They had two depressions at the top that looked like eyes.  The people gathered and decided that these infants had to be abandoned.  They threw them as far as they could.  But the twins found shelter in brush and survived.  They grew to become {{spell-nv|Binááʼ yee Aghání}}, the Monsters That Kill with Their Eyes.&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

One monster came about in a different way.  A woman named Loose Running Woman&lt;ref&gt;Fishler, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; went off alone in the direction of the sunrise.  After defecating, she used a smooth pebble from the river to clean herself.  She placed the warm stone in her genitals just as {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}, the Sun, rose above the horizon.  Seeing this, the Sun sent a ray into her.  In only nine days she gave birth to a large child.  Having no husband, and not knowing who the father of the child was, she abandoned the child in a rocky place.  But {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}} knew that the baby was his, and he protected it from afar but never visited it. The child grew to be large and powerful and very angry.  It was called {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}}, Big Giant, by the people.&lt;ref&gt;Haile, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

The monsters hid along paths, and killed and devoured travelers.  They killed many people, and the people began to live in fear.

===The Monster Slayer Twins===
Most of the people had been killed.  First Man said, "Perhaps the Holy People will help us."  In the morning, he saw a dark cloud covering the top of {{spell-nv|Chʼóolʼį́ʼí}}, the Great Spruce Mountain.  In the night he saw a fire on the mountain.  He said to First Woman, "Someone is there.  I must go to them."  "No," she said.  "There are many monsters between here and there.  It is not safe for you."  The following day the dark cloud remained on the mountain, and at night the fire appeared a second time.  This happened the third day as well.  On the fourth day, First Man said, "I must go.  I believe there is a Holy Person on the mountain who can help us."  He set out for {{spell-nv|Chʼóolʼį́ʼí}}.  As he walked, he sang: I am {{spell-nv|Áłtsé Hastiin}}, and I head for {{spell-nv|Chʼóolʼį́ʼí}} in pursuit of old age and happiness.  In pursuit of old age and happiness I follow the lightning and approach the place where it strikes.  In pursuit of old age and happiness I follow the rainbow and approach the place where it touches the earth.  In pursuit of old age and happiness I follow the dark cloud's trail and approach the place where it is thickest.  In pursuit of old age and happiness I follow the scent of the rain, and approach the place where the lines of rain are darkest.

At the very summit of {{spell-nv|Chʼóolʼį́ʼí}}, he heard the cry of an infant and the crash of lightning, the pouring of rain, and he saw the tip of a rainbow with intense colors in front of the black sky.  Suddenly the rain stopped and the sky became light.  Where he had heard the cry of a baby there was a turquoise figure of a girl lying on the ground.  First Man picked up the turquoise girl and carried it home with him.

====The Birth of Changing Woman====
Two days later First Man and First Woman were awakened very early in the morning by the sound "Wu'hu'hu'hu'."  They knew it was {{spell-nv|Haashch'ééłti'í}}, Talking God.  He told them they must return to the top of {{spell-nv|Chʼóolʼį́ʼí}} with the turquoise figure in twelve days.[[File:Talking God.jpg|400px|thumb|alt=Image of mask of Haashchʼééłtiʼí from Matthews 1902 text|Mask representing {{spell-nv|Haashchʼééłtiʼí}}, Talking God, used in [[Kléjê Hatál|Night Chant Ceremony]], recorded by Matthews in 1902]]

When they reached a level spot just below the summit of{{spell-nv| Chʼóolʼį́ʼí}}, {{spell-nv|Haashchʼééłtiʼí}} was there waiting for them.  {{spell-nv|Haashchʼééʼooghaan}}, House God, was there. {{spell-nv|Tó Neinilí}}, Water Sprinkler, was there. With them was {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}}, the Wind.  {{spell-nv|Haashchʼééłtiʼí}} lay a perfect buckskin on the ground with its head facing the west.  On the bucksin First Man lay the turquoise figure of a girl with her head to the west.  Then {{spell-nv|Haashchʼééłtiʼí}} placed another perfect buckskin over the figure, with its head facing East.  The Holy People began to sing the sacred song of {{spell-nv|Hózhǫ́ǫ́jí Sin}}, and {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}}, the Wind entered between the buckskin blankets.  The upper blanket was removed, and beneath it was a living baby girl.  Her name was {{spell-nv|Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé}}, Changing Woman.&lt;ref&gt;In some versions, including Zolbrod (p. 179), Changing Woman and White Shell Woman both emerge through this ceremony, and both subsequently  become mothers of the twins.  Hastiin Tlo'tse Hee (pp. 72-73)mentions only White Shell Woman; Yazzie (1971) mentions only Changing Woman.  The version here follows Yazzie due to the greater consistency of the account.&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy People told First Man and First Woman to take her to their home and raise her as their daughter.

First Woman and First man carried {{spell-nv|Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé}} to their hogan, and First Man made a cradle board and tied her in it. "Now she will be my daughter," he said.  First woman took the baby and breathed on her four times. "Now," she said, "she will be my daughter."  At the end of the second day the baby laughed for the first time. The Coyote named {{spell-nv|Áłtsé Hashké}} arrived and said, "I was told that my grandchild laughed for the first time." First Woman took charcoal and gave it to the Coyote saying: "This is the only thing that lasts." He painted his nose with it and said, "I shall know all things. I shall live long by it."  Satisfied with the gift, he departed. Since then persons always receive a gift when a baby laughs for the first time, and the First Laugh Ceremony is performed.&lt;ref&gt;Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

By the thirteenth day, {{spell-nv|Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé}} had become a young woman, and on that day she said to First Woman, "Something unusual has passed through me." First woman said, "That is your first race, {{spell-nv|kinaashdaah}}." They covered the floor of the hogan with blankets, and Changing Woman lay on them face down. First Man pulled her hair down, and shaped her face, and dressed her in beautiful goods, beads, bracelets, and earrings, and tied her hair with a strip of perfect buckskin. Then First Man and First Woman stepped outside the hogan and told {{spell-nv|Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé}} to run her first race around a cedar tree and return, from east to west, as the sun does. When she returned, they invited all the people to a sing over her in the hogan called {{spell-nv|Hooghan Hotłʼeztsoos}}, Changeable House, on the mountain called {{spell-nv|Dził Náʼodiłii}} four days later. A great crowd gathered in the evening of the fourth day. A sweet corn cake was made from different colored corn meal sweetened with yeast. The Night Chant was sung, and in the morning the men received some of the maiden's cake as a gift for their chants, and {{spell-nv|Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé}}, Changing Woman sat in the back of the hogan as gifts were piled in front of her. In this way the First Race of every young woman should be celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birth of the Twins====
Soon after that, Changing Woman wished for a mate. Every morning when the sun rose she lay on her back until noon, her head to the west and her feet to the east.  At noon she went to the spring. She lay under the ledge and let spring water drip over her body. This took place each day for four days. On the fourth day, she heard a sound behind her and turned and saw a young man on a great white horse with black eyes. It had a long white mane, and pranced above the ground and not on the earth itself. The bridle and the saddle were white. The young man's moccasins and leggings were also white. The rider spoke: "You lay towards me each morning until noon. When I am half over the center of the earth, you go to the spring. Your wish could not have two meanings. Go home and tell your father to build a brush hogan to the south of your home. Fill a basket with meal and set it in the hogan. Make a line of pollen from east to west across the basket on top of the meal. Make a line of pollen from north to south drawn around the basket. You and your father must sit there late into the night. He will then go home to his wife and you must stay there alone."

Changing Woman returned home and told what had happened to her parents.  First Man said that it could not be true, but First Woman said that it was indeed the message of a Holy Being and they must obey. And so First Man and {{spell-nv|Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé}} prepared the hogan and the basket and waited long into the night. Finally First Man returned home. When Changing Woman returned home in the morning, First Man asked her at once: "Who came last night?" The girl said, "No one came, but some of the meal has been taken."  The same thing happened the second night, and the third. On the morning after the fourth night, the girl told First Man, "I saw no one, but someone touched me, and I was moved."&lt;ref&gt;According to Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee (p. 77), this story is told in a chant during wedding ceremonies, which make use of the meal basket and pollen.  Because First Woman was not invited to the brush hogan, the groom must not look upon his wife's mother during the ceremony.&lt;/ref&gt;  Four days later, {{spell-nv|Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé}} said, "Mother, something moves within me." First Woman answered, "Daughter, that must be your baby moving."

On the ninth day, Changing Woman felt her birth labor begin. Talking God appeared, carrying a rope of sunbeam. Water Sprinkler the Rain God appeared carrying a rope of rainbow. Saying nothing, the two beings gave one end of each rope to Changing Woman and silently bid her pull them with each spasm of labor. This began the custom of giving a rope to a woman who is in labor.&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; A baby boy emerged, and Talking God took it aside and washed it, and severed its cord. A second baby boy emerged, and Water Sprinkler took it aside and washed it and severed its cord.

====Preparation of the Twins====
After four days, {{spell-nv|Haashchʼééłtiʼí}}, Talking God, and {{spell-nv|Tó Neinilí}}, Water Sprinkler, returned.  The twins had already grown into big boys.  "{{spell-nv|Shinálí}} (Grandsons)," Talking God said, "We have come to run a race with you."  "We will see how fit you have become," said Water Sprinkler.  They agreed to race around the mountain.  The boys ran fast, and the two Holy People ran slower.  But soon the boys became tired and the Holy People came up behind them and began taunting them and whipping them with switches of mountain mahogany.  As they approached home, Talking God and Water Sprinkler ran past them and won the race.  "We will return in four days to race again," they said, and departed.  In the evening, the boys were sore and tired. {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}}, the Wind came to them and said, "Practice each day and grow stronger."  In four days, Talking God and Water Sprinkler returned, and the four raced again around the mountain.  It was a faster pace, but just as before, Talking God and Water Sprinkler ran just behind the twins and whipped them with switches.  Again the Holy People said they would return in four days to race again.  And again in the evening {{spell-nv|Niłchʼi}} came and encouraged them and urged them to train.  Each day the boys trained, and in the third race, Talking God and Water Sprinkler no longer whipped the twins, but had to run their strongest to win the race at the end.  Four days later they returned to race a final time.  Again, the boys started very fast, but this time they did not tire and slow their pace.  They led the whole way and won the race.  "Well done, {{spell-nv|Shinálí}}," said Talking God and Water Sprinkler.  "You have grown into what we wanted you to become. Now you can serve well those who have nurtured you."&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, pp. 184-187&lt;/ref&gt;

The twins came to Changing Woman, {{spell-nv|Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé}}, and asked, "Mother, who is our father?"  "You have no father," she said.  "We must have a father," replied the twins.  "We need to know who he is."  "Your father is a round cactus, then," said Changing Woman.  "Be still."&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, pp. 187-188&lt;/ref&gt;

First Man made bows and arrows for the twins, and they traveled to the south to hunt.  They saw a large black bird on a tree, and tried to hit it with an arrow, but it flew away.  When they told Changing Woman this, she said, "That was Raven, and he may be a spy for {{spell-nv|Tsé Nináhálééh}}, the Monster Bird, who devours our people.  Do not go there again."  The following day the boys took their bows and headed west.  They saw a large black bird with a red head, and tried to kill it, but it flew away.  When they told Changing Woman this, she said, "That was Vulture.  He may be a spy for {{spell-nv|Tsédah Hódziiłtáłii}}, the Monster that Kicks People Down Cliffs.  Do not go there again."  The next day they boys traveled north, and there they saw a black and white bird with a piercing voice.  They tried to shoot it with their arrows, but it flew away.  When they told their mother, she said, "That was Magpie.  He is a spy for {{spell-nv|Binááʼ yee Aghání}}, the Monster Who Kills With His Eyes.  If he sees you he will paralyze you with his eyes and peck you to pieces."  Changing Woman cried, "Now the monsters know about you, and they will come to kill you.  You must stay inside."

The next morning Changing Woman climbed a hill.  Looking in the distance she saw many monsters approaching from the south and from the west and from the north.  She made four sacred hoops.  The white one she threw to the east.  The blue one she threw to the south. The yellow one she threw to the west.  The black one she threw to the north.  At once a strong wind began to circle the hogan.  "The wind is too strong for the monsters to enter," she told her sons.  We will be safe for one day.  But tomorrow the power will be gone."  At night, the twins spoke softly to one another.  "The monsters are coming for us," they said.  "We must leave so the others will be safe."  Before dawn, they left and ran down the holy path to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, pp. 189-195&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Journey to the Sun====
By daybreak the twins were approaching the sacred mountain called {{spell-nv|Dził Náʼoodiłii}}.  They saw smoke rising from the ground, and saw that it came from an underground chamber with a ladder extending.  When they looked down into the entrance they saw an old woman sitting before a small fire.  It was {{spell-nv|Naʼashjéʼii Asdzą́ą́}}, Spider Woman.  "Enter, {{spell-nv|shiyáázh}} (my sons)," she said in a raspy voice. "Who are you and why do you walk on Atiin diyinii, the trail of the rainbow?"  The boys entered.  "We do not know who we are, and we do not know where we are going," said the twins.  "We are fleeing for our lives."  "You must tell me more," said Spider Woman.  "{{spell-nv|Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé}}, Changing Woman, is our mother, and we flee {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ}}, the Alien Monsters," said the boys.  "You are welcome here, and you can learn much from me," said Spider Woman.  "But you must tell me more."  "We are yátashkii, raised without a father," the twins said.  "Perhaps our father is a round cactus.  We follow the Holy Trail because the monsters will destroy us if they can."

{{spell-nv|Naʼashjéʼii Asdzą́ą́}}, Spider Woman, stood and extended her arms. "I will tell you who your father is and how to go to him," she said, and she gestured to the first twin to sit on a chair of obsidian and to the second twin to sit on a chair of turquoise.  She gave them food.  Then she said, "Your father is {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}, the Sun.  His dwelling is far to the east.  The way is long and dangerous.  Many monsters live between here and there.  And your father may try to harm you."  "Tell us how to go there," said the twins.  "You must cross four dangerous places," said Spider Woman. You must pass the rocks that crush all travelers.  You must cross the reeds that cut travelers to pieces.  You must cross between the cane cactuses that cut travelers to shreds.  Then you must pass the boiling sands that burn travelers to fine ashes. Beyond those four points no ordinary creature can pass.  But I will give you a talisman that will help you." Saying this, she handed the boys the sacred {{spell-nv|naayééʼ atsʼos}}, a hoop fashioned from the life feathers of monster eagles.  "Treat this charm carefully and use it correctly," she said.  "As you face your enemies, stare at them without fear, and extend the {{spell-nv|naayééʼ atsʼos}} towards them.  Then repeat this song:
"Rub your feet with pollen and rest them. Rub your hands with pollen and rest them. Rub your body with pollen and lie at rest. Rub your head with pollen and put your mind to rest.  Then truly your feet become pollen.  Your hands become pollen. Your body becomes pollen.  Your head becomes pollen. Your spirit will then become pollen.  Your voice will then become pollen.  All of you is as pollen is. And what pollen is, that is what peace is. The trail ahead is now a beautiful trail. Long life is ahead.  Happiness is ahead."  "Now," she said, "You are ready to go on. You have the power that you need. Walk in beauty."&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, pp. 196-199.&lt;/ref&gt;

The twins continued east on the Trail of the Rainbow until they came to a narrow pass between two high cliffs.  The cliffs pulled apart as they approached.  They walked quickly to the opening and stopped suddenly, and the cliffs slammed together in front of them.  "We are the children of {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}, the Sun," the twins called. We go to him with a message from Spider Woman."  "Tell us the message," called a voice.  The boys held out the naayééʼ atsʼos and sang the song Spider Woman had taught them.  The cliffs parted, and the twins passed safely between them.  Next they came to the slashing reeds, and again they held out the {{spell-nv|naayééʼ atsʼos}} and sang the holy song, and passed safely through.  They came next to the cane cactuses, {{spell-nv|Hosh Ditsáhiitsoh}}, which sprang to life as they approached.  Again with the {{spell-nv|naayééʼ atsʼos}} and the song of Spider Woman they passed through safely.  At last they came to {{spell-nv|Séítʼáád}}, the Boiling Dunes, which began to swirl and boil when they approached.  "We must know who you are and where you come from and where you are going and to what purpose," roared the dunes.  "We are the children of {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}, the Sun," the twins called. We come from {{spell-nv|Dził Náʼoodiłii}}. We go to our father with a message from Spider Woman."  They held out the {{spell-nv|naayééʼ atsʼos}}, and sang the song of Spider Woman, and the dunes subsided.  "Continue on," the dunes said.  "Long life is ahead. Happiness is ahead." To the east the twins saw the turquoise dwelling of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod pp. 200-205&lt;/ref&gt;

====Encounter with The Sun====
The twins entered the house of the Sun before {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}} had completed his journey across the sky.  They saw a woman sitting against the western wall, and they saw two handsome young men, {{spell-nv|Iiʼni Łizhinii}}, Black Thunder, and {{spell-nv|Iiʼni Dootłʼizhii}}, Blue Thunder. No one spoke to them.  "We are from {{spell-nv|Dził Náʼoodiłii}}," the twins said. "Our mother is {{spell-nv|Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé}}, Changing Woman, and we have been told that {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}, the Sun, is our father.  We have followed the Holy Trail to seek his help."  The woman remained silent.  Black Thunder and Blue Thunder approached the twins, and wrapped four blankets around them.  They wrapped them in the blanket of red dawn, and the blanket of blue daylight, and the blanket of yellow evening, and the blanket of black darkness.  Then Black Thunder and Blue Thunder lifted the bundled twins and lay them high on a shelf.

After a while the twins heard the Sun enter.  He removed his glowing hot disk from his back and hung it on the wall.  "Who has come here today?" he asked the woman.  She did not answer.  "From above I saw two strangers come here," said {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}.  "Where are they?"  The woman remained silent.  "I know that two strangers are here," said {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}, "And I demand to know where they are."  "Two young men did come here," said the woman, "and they claim they are your sons.  You have promised me that I am the only woman you see.  So whose sons are these?" and she went to the bundle and pulled on the blankets.  The twins fell to the floor, and at once grasped the hoop of feathers that Spider Woman had given them.  {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}} the Sun said, "I will see if you are my sons," and he seized them at once and hurled them against the sharp spikes of white shell on the eastern wall of his house.  The twins, holding the {{spell-nv|naayééʼ atsʼos}}, bounced back unharmed.  The Sun seized them again and hurled them against the turquoise spikes on his southern wall.  Again they held the {{spell-nv|naayééʼ atsʼos}} and bounced back unharmed.  "You must survive two more tests," said {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}.  He took them outside where there was a great sweathouse, and he started a fire to heat the four large rocks within it.  While he did this, {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}}, the Wind, came up to the twins and whispered "You must dig a tunnel to the outside and hide in it after you have answered his question."  The twins dug the tunnel while the Sun prepared the fire, and hid its opening with a stone.  The Sun then commanded them to enter the sweatlodge.  After a while {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}} said, "Is it hot in there?"  "Yes," answered the twins, and then they hid in the tunnel they had dug.  {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}} suddenly poured a great quantity of water through the hole in the top of the sweatlodge, and when it hit the hot rocks they exploded and hot steam hissed.  After a while the twins crawled back into the sweatlodge.  {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}} called, "Is it hot in there?" expecting to get no answer.  But the twins answered, "Not so hot as before."  The Sun opened the door.  "Perhaps you truly are my sons," he said. "Come inside, and we will smoke."

He turned and entered his house.  As he did, {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}}, the Wind, came up beside the twins.  "The tobacco is poisonous," he whispered.  "The spittle of {{spell-nv|Wóóseekʼidii}}, the spiny caterpillar will protect you."  At once the twins saw a spiny caterpillar on the path, and took some of its spittle into their mouths.  Inside, {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}, the Sun, brought forth a turquoise pipe from a high shelf on his eastern wall and lit it with the red sun disk.  He puffed on it himself, and then passed it to the twins, who each puffed on it themselves.  "What sweet tobacco," said the twins.  Seeing this, {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}} the Sun said, "Truly you are my sons. Now tell me why you have come."  "Father," they said, "we have come because {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ}}, the Alien Monsters, are killing all our people.  {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}} the Big Giant devours our people.  {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}}, the Horned Monster, devours them.  {{spell-nv|Tsé Nináhálééh}}, the Bird Monster, devours them, and so does {{spell-nv|Binááʼ yee Aghání}}, who kills with his eyes.  Give us weapons so that we may destroy {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}} and the others."

{{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}} looked in all four directions and saw that the woman was not in the house.  Then he said, "I will help you.  But {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}}, the Big Giant, is also my son.  I will give you weapons so that you may fight the monsters.  But I am the one who will strike the first blow when you fight against {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}} the Big Giant.  I must do that myself." Then he gave the twins helmets and shirts of hard flint scales, and {{spell-nv|atsiniltłʼish kʼaaʼ}}, the chain lightning arrows, and {{spell-nv|atsoolaghał kʼaaʼ}}, the sheet lightning arrows, and {{spell-nv|shá bitłʼóól kʼaaʼ}}, the deadly sunbeam arrows.  And to each he gave {{spell-nv|béésh doolghasii}}, the stone knife with the hard blade, and {{spell-nv|hatsoiiłhał}}, the stone knife with the broad blade.

When the Sun left on his journey across the top of the sky the next morning, he took the twins with him.  At noon they came to {{spell-nv|Yágháhookááʼ}}, the hole at the top of the sky.  "Now show me where you live," said the Sun.  With the help of {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}}, the Wind, the twins, pointed out the four sacred mountains of the four directions, and {{spell-nv|Dził Náʼoodiłii}}, the Travelers' Circle Mountain, near the center.  "We live near there," they said.  "All that you have told me I now know to be true, my sons," said {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}.  "You will succeed against the Monsters, and in your war against them you will make the final passage from boyhood to manhood."  Then he sent down a streak of lightning onto the top of {{spell-nv|Tsoodził}}, the Blue Bead Mountain that was the home of {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}}, the Big Giant, and the twins slid down it.&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, pp. 205-215; Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, pp. 78-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Destruction of the Monsters===

====The Slaying of Yéʼiitsoh, the Big Giant====
It is said that the twin sons of Jóhonaaʼéí descended from the sky to the top of {{spell-nv|Tsoodził}}, the Blue Bead Mountain, and came down the mountain on its south slope.  They walked on to {{spell-nv|Tó Sido}}, which some call Warm Spring.&lt;ref&gt;Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee (p. 83) identifies this as Navajo Springs, Arizona.&lt;/ref&gt;  There they found {{spell-nv|Dinééh Diyiní}}, the Holy Boy, and {{spell-nv|Atʼééd Diyiní}}, Spirit Girl.  "Where are you going?" asked Holy Boy.  "We have come to find {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}}, the Big Giant," said the twins.  "He is huge, and very powerful," said Holy Boy.  "Each day he comes late in the day to {{spell-nv|Tó Sido}}, to drink from the lake."  The next day at dawn the brothers walked to {{spell-nv|Tó Sido}} and stood beside the large lake.  They took one of the chain lightning arrows their father had given them and shot it at a slab of high rock overhanging the base of Tsoodził.  The arrow struck the rock with such force that it shattered and fell where it remains today.  "With such weapons as these we cannot fail," they said.

Late in the day they heard {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}}, the Big Giant, approaching.  His footsteps shook the canyon walls. Then they saw him come to the water's edge and stoop down to drink. He drank deeply four times, until most of the water was gone from the lake. Then he saw the reflection of the twins in the water, and stood and stared at them.  {{spell-nv|"Yiiniikeetsóóko! Yiiniikeetsóóko!"}}&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod (p. 397) explains that this word was reported as uttered by Yéʼiitsoh by Matthews in Navajo Legends in 1897.  He translated it as "Fee Fie Fo Fum"&lt;/ref&gt; he shouted. The twins did not understand, but answered, {{spell-nv|"Yiiniikeetsóóko! Yiiniikeetsóóko!"}} Then {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}} paced back and forth and said, "What are the two beautiful things that I see, and how shall I kill them?"  The twins shouted back, "What beautiful Big Thing is walking about?  And how shall we kill it?"&lt;ref&gt;Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}}, the Wind came to them and whispered in their ear that since Big Giant was their elder he should be given right of first strike, as they were destroying the child of the Sun. Then suddenly {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}}, the Wind, called "Akóóh! Beware! Jump!" and suddenly the twins found themselves standing on the end of a rainbow, just as {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}}, the Big Giant, hurled his great black knife at them.&lt;ref&gt;Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, p. 83.  In Zolbrod's version (p. 219) the Giant hurls lightning bolts.&lt;/ref&gt; The rainbow raised up, and the knife passed just below their feet.  {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}}, the Wind, whispered "Keep low now!" and {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}} hurled his great blue knife.  It passed over them.  The Wind said, "Jump to the right!" and the great yellow knife of {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}} passed just to their left.  "This is his last weapon," whispered the Wind.  "Jump to the left. Now!" The twins leapt to the left, just as the white knife with many points passed to the right of them."  The twins were about to use one of their own weapons when a blinding flash of lightning came out of the sky and struck {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}} the Giant on the side of the head.  The heavens shook with the thunder, and the Giant shook but stayed on his feet.  Then the elder of the two brothers shot a chain-lightning arrow at {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}}.  The Giant dropped to his knee, but stood again.  The second brother then shot an arrow of sheet lightning which struck the giant in the chest.  He fell to both knees and began to fall forward, catching himself with his hands.  Then the first brother shot a deadly sunbeam arrow and hit the Giant in the head.  {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}} fell face down on the ground.  Blood flowed in great streams from the Giant's mouth, and {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}}, the Wind said, "Stop the blood before it reaches the water! It will become alive!"  The twins ran to block the flow of blood and it remains on the ground today near the spring at the foot of {{spell-nv|Tsoodził}}, the Blue Bead Mountain.&lt;ref&gt;Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, p. 83-84, referring to the lava flow SW of the San Mateo Mountains&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tó Bájísh Chíní.jpg|250px|thumb|alt=Image of mask of Tó Bájísh Chíní from Matthews 1902 text|Mask representing the younger twin, known both as {{spell-nv|Naʼídígishí}}, He Who Cuts Life Out of the Enemy, and {{spell-nv|Tóbájíshchíní}}, Born of Water. Mask used in Night Chant Ceremony, recorded by Matthews in 1902]]The twins approached the body of the Giant and saw that he was dead.  The younger brother removed the Giant's scalp as proof.  Around his body lay many chips of flint from his armor.  The twins hurled the flint in each of the four directions, saying, "From now on the people of the earth shall use you."  Then the older brother said to the young brother, "I will call you {{spell-nv|Naʼídígishí}}, He Who Cuts Life Out of the Enemy."&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  The younger brother then said to his older brother, "And I will call you {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}, Monster Slayer.  It is the name by which you shall always be known."  Then the two brothers climbed back to the top of {{spell-nv|Tsoodził}}, the Blue Bead Mountain where they had landed after descending from the sky, and each sang a song in praise of their father, Jóhonaaʼéí, the Sun, as he neared the end of his journey across the sky.  Then they rested for the night.

The next morning the two brothers started for home.  Along the trail they met {{spell-nv|Haashch'ééłti'í}}, Talking God, and {{spell-nv|Tó Neinilí}}, Water Sprinkler.  "Well done, nihinálí, our grandsons," they said.  You are worthy of all that we taught you.  You have served your people well."  And the two gods each sang a song to celebrate the victory of the twins over {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}}, the Giant.  These two songs are sung today whenever a victory is celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;  When the brothers came close to the home of Changing Woman, their mother, and First Man and First Woman, they hid their armor and weapons and the scalp of {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}} in the bushes, and then went inside.  Changing Woman rejoiced when she saw them.  "Where have you been?" she asked.  "I thought a monster had devoured you."  "We followed {{spell-nv|Atiin Diyinii}}, the Holy Trail," said the elder son, {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}.  "We came upon {{spell-nv|Naʼashjéʼii}}, Spider Woman, and she told us how to go to the house of {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí nihitaaʼ}}, our father the Sun.  He gave us weapons, and with them we killed {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}}, the Big Giant."  "Do not say this," said First Man.  "No one can kill {{spell-nv|Yéʼiitsoh}}."  Then the brothers led their mother and grandparents outside and showed them the scalp of Yéʼiitsoh, and they rejoiced.  Together they sang and danced to celebrate the victory.&lt;ref&gt;Hastiin Tlo'Tsi Hee, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Slaying of Déélgééd, the Horned Monster====
{{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}, the elder brother, wished to fight the other monsters, it is said.  He asked Changing Woman where the Horned Monster, {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}}, lived.  Changing Woman said, "He lives at {{spell-nv|Bikʼi Halzhin}}, at the foot of the mountains. But you have done enough, my son, and the monsters are hard to kill."  "It was also hard for you to give birth to me," said {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}. "Where {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}} lives it is dangerous," said Changing Woman.  "To all the ends of the earth, there is no such place as Dangerous," answered {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}.&lt;ref&gt;Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers together made two prayer sticks of the medicine plant {{spell-nv|[[:nv:azeeʼ łahdiltʼéii|azeeʼ łahdiltʼéii]]}}, each three finger widths long, and lay them in a turquoise dish.  Then {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}, Monster Slayer, said to {{spell-nv|Naʼídígishí}}, Who Cuts the Life Out of the Enemy, "My brother, I will go alone to fight {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}}.  You stay here and watch the holy medicine sticks.  If a sunbeam should light either one, you will know that I am in danger, and you must help me.  Otherwise, stay and protect the others."

At dawn {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}} set out to find {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}}, the Horned Monster.  He came to a broad plain at the foot of the mountains, and saw {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}} lying at rest. It had hair like a moose and a great pair of horns. While {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}, Monster Slayer stood watching, Gopher, {{spell-nv|Naʼazísí}} came up to him. "I wonder what you are doing here," he said. "There is someone here I seek," said Monster Slayer.  "Do you not fear {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}}, the Horned Monster who feeds on your kind?" asked Gopher. "Now that you mention it, it is he I seek," said Monster Slayer. "I wish to kill him."  "I can help you with that," said Gopher, "but I want a piece of his hide."  "You shall have it," said {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}.  Then Gopher dug a tunnel right up to {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}}.  He returned and said, "I have tunneled right up to where he lies.  And from that spot I have tunneled to the East, the South, the West, and the North.  You can travel beneath him and shoot an arrow straight up into his heart."  {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}, Monster Slayer, could not enter the tunnel because it was too small.  "Raise your right leg," said Gopher.  While Monster Slayer raised his leg, Gopher blew into her tunnel four times, and each time it became larger.  Then {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}, Monster Slayer entered the tunnel and crawled to where {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}} lay above the opening.  He shot a chain-lightning arrow straight up into {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}}.  The monster roared and tore at the earth with his horns. Monster Slayer hid in the tunnel to the east. {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}} tore at the earth around the tunnel.  Before he could reach him, Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the south. Déélgééd began to tear the earth at that spot with his horns, and Monster Slayer ran into the tunnel to the west.  {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}} dug into the earth at that spot, but Monster Slayer had run into the tunnel to the north. {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}} began to dig to the north, but he was now weak. He fell and lay down.  {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}, Monster Slayer crept back up the full length of the tunnel, to where Gopher had started it, and climbed out.  There, a little old man dressed in tight leggings and a thin shirt wearing a cap with a feather approached him.  This was {{spell-nv|Hazéítsoh}}, the Ground Squirrel.  "{{spell-nv|Yáʼátʼééh shínaaí}}," said Ground Squirrel.  "What brings you to this place?" "I am looking at something," said {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}, Monster Slayer.  "I wonder what you are looking at," said Ground Squirrel. "I am looking at {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}}," said Monster Slayer.  "I wonder if I need fear him."  "I will go over there and see if he is dead," said Ground Squirrel.  "If he no longer breathes I will climb up on his horns and dance and sing.  If he is dead, I want some of his blood to decorate my face." "Truly, little brother," answered Monster Slayer, "you shall have it."  Ground Squirrel went to {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}}, saw that he was dead, and put some of his blood on his face and danced and sang. The face of every ground squirrel bears red streaks to this day.  And so it is that there has always been good will between Earth Surface People and the ground squirrels.  Gopher came and removed some of {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}}'s skin and put it on his own back.  So it is that the back of gophers is thickly covered to this day, and there has been harmony between Earth Surface People and gophers to this day.  And Gopher gave part of the monster's bowel and lung to Monster Slayer to take back as proof that {{spell-nv|Déélgééd}} was slain.

{{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}, Monster Slayer, returned to his home and showed the lung and bowel of Déélgééd to Changing Woman and First Woman.  They danced and chanted in victory.  Now two of the monsters were dead.  The plan of the Holy People was being fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, pp. 224-231; Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, pp. 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Old Age, Cold, Poverty, and Hunger ===
In a few days, {{spell-nv|Naayéé' Neizghání}} had killed {{spell-nv|Tsé Nináhálééh}}, Monster Eagle, and {{spell-nv|Tsé dah Hódziiłtáłii}}, The Monster Who Kicks People Down the Cliff, and {{spell-nv|Binááʼ yee Aghání}}, the Monsters That Kill with Their Eyes.  "Surely the {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ}} have all been destroyed now," said Changing Woman.  {{spell-nv|Níłch'i}}, The Wind, whispered into the ear of Monster Slayer, "Some still survive.  {{spell-nv|Są́}}, the Old Age Woman, still remains.  She looks like a frail creature, but she slowly saps strength with the passing years.  Beware of her."  Monster Slayer said to his mother, "Tell me where I can find the dwelling place of {{spell-nv|Są́}}, The One Who Brings Old Age."  "There is no need for you to seek her," said Changing Woman.  {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}} The Wind whispered, "She lives among the mountains at {{spell-nv|Dibé Nitsa}}a, the Place of Mountain Sheep."[[File:Naayéé' Neizghání.jpg|300px|thumb|alt=Image of mask of Naayéé' Neizghání from Matthews 1902 text|Mask representing {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}, Monster Slayer, used in Night Chant Ceremony, recorded by Matthews in 1902]]

When he arrived at {{spell-nv|Dibé Nitsaa}}, {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}} saw an old woman walking slowly toward him, leaning on a staff.  Her back was bent.  Her hair was white.  Her arms and hands were bony.  "Old grandmother, I have come to kill you," he said.  "I do you no harm, grandson," she replied.  "Think it over before you kill me.  Once the people discover that {{spell-nv|Są́}} will no longer slowly sap their strength with the passing of years and finally devour them, they will have no children.  It is better that people should pass on their wisdom and responsibilities to those who are younger, and finally die." "I will spare you," replied {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}. And he returned without a trophy.

"{{spell-nv|Hakʼaz Asdzą́ą́}}, the Cold Woman, still lives," whispered {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}} The Wind to Monster Slayer.  "Each year she freezes the earth.  She covers the streams with ice.  She kills the plants so that the vines bear no melons and the stalks bear no corn."  "Mother," demanded {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}, "tell me where I might find the dwelling of {{spell-nv|Hakʼaz Asdzą́ą́}}."  Changing Woman refused to answer.  But {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}}, The Wind, whispered, "She lives high on the summet of {{spell-nv|Dibé Nitsaa}}, where the mountain sheep are."  Monster Slayer traveled to {{spell-nv|Dibé Nitsaa}} and found a lean old woman sitting above the tree line without clothing, on the snow.  No roof sheltered her.  Her skin was pale as the snow.  "Grandmother," said Monster Slayer, "I am here to kill you."  "You may kill me," said Cold Woman.  "But once I am dead, it will always be hot on the earth.  The land will dry up.  The springs will cease to flow.  Over the years the people will perish."  Listening to her words, {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}} said, "I will spare you."  And he returned without a trophy.

"{{spell-nv|Téʼéʼį́ Dineʼé}}, the Poverty Creatures, still live," whispered {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}} into his ear.  They destroy people by gradually using up possessions.  They will leave no tools for anyone to use, and no clothing to wear."  Monster Slayer asked Changing Woman where the Poverty Creatures dwelled, but she refused to tell him.  "They live at {{spell-nv|Dził dah Neeztínii}}, the Roof Butte Mountain," said {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}}.  {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}} traveled there, and found a tattered old man and a filthy old woman.  Their garments were in shreds, and in their house they had no goods.  They had no food, no baskets, no bowls.  "Grandmother, Grandfather," said Monster Slayer, "It gives me no pleasure, but I have come to kill you.  Then people will not suffer from want."  "Think a moment," they said.  "If we were to die, people would not replace anything, or improve on their tools. By causing things to wear out, we lead people to invent new things. Garments become more beautiful. Tools become more useful. People appreciate what they have."  Monster Slayer said, "What you say is true.  I will spare you."  And he returned without a trophy.

"{{spell-nv|Dichin Hastiin}}, Hunger Man, still exists," whispered {{spell-nv|Níłchʼi}}. "He lives at {{spell-nv|Tłʼoh adaasgaii}}, White Spot of Grass."  When he arrived there, {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}} found twelve ravenous creatures who ate anything that grew. The largest of them was Dichin Hastiin. "I have come here to kill you," said {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}. "Then people will not feel the pangs of hunger and they will not starve for want of food."  "I do not blame you for wanting me dead," said {{spell-nv|Dichin Hastiin}}. "But if you kill us, people will lose their taste for food. They will never know the pleasure of cooking and eating. But if we live, they will continue to plant seeds and harvest crops, and they will remain skilled hunters."  After hearing these words, Monster Slayer returned without a trophy.&lt;ref&gt;This version relies on Zolbrod, pp. 263-270. The 1928 version reported by Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee (pp. 99-100)includes Death and Lice in place of Cold and Hunger.&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returned home to his mother Changing Woman, he removed the sheath wherein he carried the stone knife that his father {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí hataaʼ}} the Sun had given him.  He realized that now his work was done.  He sang:&lt;br /&gt;
''Now the enemy slayer arrives''&lt;br /&gt;
''From the house of the jagged blades he arrives''&lt;br /&gt;
''From where the sharp knives hang he arrives''&lt;br /&gt;
''And the treasures he has won are yours, oh you gods.''&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure of Changing Woman===
Changing Woman and {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}} and the younger twin, {{spell-nv|Naʼídígishí}}, who was also known as {{spell-nv|Tóbájíshchíní}}, Child of the Water, now heard a voice from the east chanting in reply:&lt;br /&gt; 
''With the Slayer of Monsters I come.''&lt;br /&gt;  
''From the house of the dark stone blades I come.''&lt;br /&gt;  
''From where the dark stone knives hang I come.''&lt;br /&gt; 
''Giver of the sacred hoops I come.''&lt;br /&gt;  
''I come, I come! The dreaded one.''&lt;br /&gt;
Changing Woman said, "It is the voice of your father. Dress yourselves quickly."  And then she left the hogan.

{{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}, the Sun, entered and greeted the twins. To {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}} he said, "My son, have you slain all the enemies of the people?"  {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}} replied, "Those who should die I have killed. I have been among the highest peaks, and I been through the deepest canyons. I have been to the edge of the waters, and I have been to the boundaries of the sky. And wherever I went I found no one who is not a friend to our people." "Then your work is done," said {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}. "I will take the weapons I gave you back with me. Tell your mother that after four days I will return. I wish to speak with her on top of {{spell-nv|Chʼóolʼį́ʼí}}, the Giant Spruce Mountain."  And he departed.

After four days, {{spell-nv|Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé}}, Changing Woman, went to the summit of {{spell-nv|Chʼóolʼį́ʼí}}, the Giant Spruce Mountain, and sat on a rock near the spot where she had first felt the warmth of the sun deep within her body.  {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}, the Sun, came and sat beside her. He tried to embrace her, but she stopped him. "What do you mean by that?" she said. "I want you for my own," he replied. "Come to the west and make a home with me there."  "I wish no such thing," she said. "I am lonely," said {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}. "What good is all that I do if I must endure my days and nights all alone?"  After a time a silence, {{spell-nv|Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé}} spoke. "I am told you have a beautiful house in the east. I want such a house in the west. I want it built floating on the shimmering water, away from the shore, so that the Earth-Surface people will not bother me with their quarrels. I want white shell, and blue shell, and turquoise. I want haliotis. I want soapstone, agate, redstone, and jet. Because I will live there alone while you are gone each day, I want animals to keep me company.  Give me buffalo, and deer, and mountain sheep, jackrabbits, prairie dogs, and muskrats. Provide me with those things and I shall go with you to the west."

"What do you mean by making such demands of me?" said {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}. "Why should I provide you with all of those things?"  "I will tell you why," she said. "You are male and I am female. You are of the sky and I am of the earth. You are constant in your brightness, but I must change with the seasons. Remember that I willingly let you enter me and I gave birth to your sons,&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, p. 275, has Changing Woman mention only one son, the older twin, with the implication that the younger twin is the son of the spring (water).&lt;/ref&gt;  enduring pain to bring them into the world. As different as we are, we are of one spirit. As dissimilar as we are, you and I, we are of equal worth. As different as we are, there must be solidarity between us. There can be no harmony in the universe unless there is harmony between us. If there is to be harmony, my request must matter to you. There is to be no more coming from me to you than there is from you to me."&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}} gave no reply. He carefully weighed all that she had said. Then slowly he placed his arm around her. She allowed him to do so. Then he promised her that all the things she wished for she would have. She would have a house in the west on the shimmering water. She would have gems, and animals. They would dwell together in harmony.

When Changing Woman was ready to depart for her new home, the Mirage People and the Ground Mist People prepared to go with her. She said goodbye to First Man and First Woman and to her two sons. Then she and the Holy People passed through the mountains at {{spell-nv|Béésh łichííʼí}} (Red Knife), and in the {{spell-nv|Chʼíńlį́}} Valley they celebrated her betrothal to {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}. Her hips widened, and her breasts grew large. The elk and buffalo multiplied, and some left her herd to form other herds and spread across the land. At last she and her party and animals came to the end of the land, and then to her floating house beyond the shore. Then {{spell-nv|Naayééʼ Neizghání}}, Monster Slayer, and his brother {{spell-nv|Tóbájíshchíní}}, Water Born, traveled to {{spell-nv|Tó Aheedlí}},&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; where the Pine River flows into the San Juan, and there they continue to live below the earth. A petroglyph was made on the canyon wall just above the water level to mark the place.&lt;ref&gt;Hastiin Tlo'tsi Hee, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Then {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}, the Sun, said that it was time for the first four Holy People to depart from the surface of the Fourth World. These four, who had come from the First World, were First Man, {{spell-nv|Áłtsé Hastiin}}, First Woman, {{spell-nv|Áłtsé Asdzą́ą́}}, {{spell-nv|Mąʼiitoʼí Áłchíní}}, Great Coyote, and the coyote {{spell-nv|Áłtsé Hashké}}, First Angry. They traveled east, beyond the house of the Sun, and took all their powers with them. As they began to travel, First Woman turned and said, "When I wish to do so, I will send back death from disease, and the sign will be the howl of the coyote."&lt;ref name="Hastiin Tlo'tse Hee, p. 111"&gt;Hastiin Tlo'tse Hee, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Then the four Holy People who had come up from the Third World departed as well. They were {{spell-nv|Haashchʼéłtiʼí}}, Talking God, {{spell-nv|Tó Neinilí}}, Water Sprinkler, {{spell-nv|Haashchʼééʼooghaan}}, House God, and {{spell-nv|Haashchʼééshzhiní}}, Black God, the god of fire. As they departed, {{spell-nv|Haashchʼéłtiʼi}} said, "If anyone sees us it will be a sign that an enemy is coming into the country. If he hears us call, that same person will be killed by an enemy before the day is over." And so saying they all returned to their homes and all their powers went with them.&lt;ref name="Hastiin Tlo'tse Hee, p. 111"/&gt;

{{spell-nv|Asdzą́ą́ Nádleehé}}, Changing Woman, began to live in her Floating White Bead House, beyond the shore in the west. In her home on a shelf running east to west on the south side were four water jars. The first was the Black Water Jar which contained the Black Cloud and the Male Rain. The second was the Blue Water Jar which contained the Blue Cloud and the Male Rain. The third was the Yellow Water Jar which contained the Yellow Cloud and the Male Rain. The fourth was the White Water Jar which contained the White Cloud and the Male Rain. On the north side of the home was a shelf running west to east and it were also four jars. The first was a Black Water Jar which contained the Black Vapor and the Female Rain. The second, the Blue Water Jar, contained the Blue Vapor and the Female Rain. The third, the Yellow Water Jar, contained Yellow Vapor and the Female Rain. And last, the White Water Jar, contained the White Vapor and the Female Rain. Other jars contained the seeds of plants and flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Hastiin Tlo'tse Hee, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

As Changing Woman walks in the four directions from her house, she undergoes a change. She comes out of her house an old woman with a white bead walking stick. She walks towards the East and returns middle aged and she carries no walking stick. To the South she walks and she returns a young woman. She walks to the West and comes back a maiden. She goes North and returns a young girl.&lt;ref&gt;Hastiin Tlo'tse Hee, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Often she and {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}}, the Sun are in harmony. At times they argue and {{spell-nv|Jóhonaaʼéí}} does not return to her home at the end of his journey. At those times the sky is stormy and the whole world suffers.&lt;ref&gt;Zolbrod, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edelin''' (?–1293) ruled over the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] [[Weissenburg Abbey (Alsace)|abbey of Weissenburg]] as its [[abbot]] from the year 1262 until his death on 15 October 1293. During his time of office, work started on the [[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] abbey church which still stands today. Because the monastery had had the majority of its possessions confiscated since the 10th century, Edelin had an inventory of estates prepared, using older documents, called the ''[[Codex Edelini]]'' or ''Liber Possessionum'', in order to index the existing estate and prevent further losses (which, as it turned, out was not successful).

The '''Feoli collection''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Sammlung Feoli'') is a formerly private collection of ancient art, which is now mostly part of the antiquities collection of the [[Martin von Wagner Museum]] in the south wing of the [[Würzburg Residenz]].

Agostino Feoli owned an estate which was located in the area of the [[necropoleis]] of the ancient [[Etruscan cities|Etruscan]] city of [[Vulci]] and carried out several excavations on his lands - like many other estate owners. He carried out two very successful campaigns, one from 1829 to 1831 and another from 1846 to 1847. Unlike most other such excavators, he did not sell many of his finds, but kept them for a personal collection which is still called the Feoli collection in honour of him. 

The collection was initially publicised by [[Eduard Gerhard]] in his ''Rapporto Vulcente'' and was published in 1837 by {{Interlanguage link multi|Secondiamo Campanari|de}} in his catalogue, ''Antichi vasi dipinti della collezione Feoli'' (Ancient Painted Vases of the Feoli Collection). Feoli sold some pieces, but he traded and bought new pieces in his later years. As a result the source of the pieces in the collection which did not appear in the 1837 catalogue is not certain. After this, the collection was considered lost at times. [[Heinrich Brunn]] found it in 1865 in [[Rome]] and returned it to academic attention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinrich Bulle]]: "Das Martin von Wagner-Museum." [[Max Buchner (historian)|Max Buchner]] (ed.): ''Aus der Vergangenheit der Universität Würzburg. Festschrift Zum 350 Jährigen Bestehen der Universität.'' Springer, Berlin und Heidelberg 1932, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

Feoli's heirs had managed to gather the collection together immediately after Feoli's death, but in 1872 they had a financial crisis and had to sell the collection quickly for whatever they could get for it. The classicist [[Ludwig von Urlichs]] of the [[University of Wurzburg]] took note, using [[Wolfgang Helbig]], who was in Rome during Easter 1872, as a mediator. With the help of the then newly invented [[telegraph]], he transmitted the information to Bavaria and quickly convinced the {{Interlanguage link multi|Bavarian State Ministry for Imagery and Culture, Scholarship and Art|de|3=Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Bildung und Kultus, Wissenschaft und Kunst|lt=Bavarian ministry of culture}}, minister [[Johann von Lutz]] and the university administration to act in order to acquire the collection for the Wurzberg collection, using the income from a forthcoming exhibition of the art-collector and painter {{Interlanguage link multi|Johann Martin von Wagner|de}}. It was more difficult to convince the university senate. It held a vote and decided that the acquisition was unnecessary, since they had already acquired a pretty substantial collection from the bequest of Wagner and some subsequent purchases. Other critics complained that there was no obvious place for storing and displaying the collection. In fact, it was originally planned that a new museum would be built with the reserves which had built up from the profits from the Wagner bequest. According to later accounts, the crucial meeting, at which the decision about the funding was to be decided, was held on a very hot and humid afternoon in the semester break. It is said that it was only thanks to a speech by [[Felix Dahn]] that the senate agreed to the speech and the money necessary to purchase the last great private collection of antiquities in Italy was made available. On 7 may 1872 the collection was bought by the university at a cost of 26,500 [[Italian lira|lire]]. The purchase of the collection had initially been partially funded by Urlich through the sale of securities from his wife's [[dowry]] - an act which she resented for the rest of her life. The transport of the collection to Wurzberg was overseen by Urlichs and his student {{Interlanguage link multi|Adam Flasch|de}}. By the end of the year, Urlichs had put the collection on display and also published a catalogue of the collection. It was the last large acquisition of the Wurzburg Museum for over twenty years.

With the acquisition of the Feoli collection, the Martin Wagner Museum gained about 480 new antiquities at once, mostly dating from between 530 and 480 BC and consisting primarily of [[Greek vase painting|Greek vases]], but also [[Etruscan vase painting|Etruscan ones]]. Today the Feoli collection is the heart of the Wurzberg collection of ancient pottery, which is the third largest in Germany after the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]] and the [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]] in [[Munich]]. The Etruscan [[Feoli painter]] was given his [[notname]] for a [[name vase|vase]] in the Feoli collection by [[John Beazley]].

The '''Fig Tree Formation''', also called '''Fig Tree Group''', is a [[stromatolite]]-containing [[geological formation]] in [[South Africa]]. The rock contains [[fossils]] of [[microorganisms|microscopic life forms]] of about 3.26 billion years old.&lt;ref&gt;[https://earth.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Brown_Christian_Thesis.pdf 2015 - Brown - Exploring the Evolution of Oxygen on the Early Earth: Constraining the Evolution of Oxidative Phosphorylation Through the Utilization of Uranium Isotopes]&lt;/ref&gt; Identified organisms include the [[bacteria|bacterium]] ''[[Eobacterium|Eobacterium isolatus]]'' and the [[algae]]-like ''[[Archaeosphaeroides|Archaeosphaeroides barbertonensis]]''. The fossils in the Fig Tree Formation are considered some of the oldest known [[organisms]] on Earth, and provide evidence that life may have existed much earlier than previously thought. The formation comprises shales, turbiditic, lithic greywackes, volcanoclastic [[sandstone]]s, [[chert]], turbiditic [[siltstone]], [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[breccia]]s, [[mudstone]]s, and iron-rich shales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adammbedzi.yolasite.com/resources/Barberton%20Geological%20Field%20Mapping%202012.pdf Barberton geological field mapping report 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Brown Goode''' (13 February 1851 &amp;ndash; 6 September 1896), was an [[ichthyologist]], although most of his time was spent as a museum administrator, and he was very interested in the history of [[science]], especially the [[History of science|history of the development of science]] in [[United States|America]]. Goode graduated from [[Wesleyan University]] and studied at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-9037376&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1872, Goode started working with [[Spencer Fullerton Baird|Spencer Baird]], soon becoming his trusted assistant. While working with Baird, Goode led research sponsored by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|United States Fish Commission]], and oversaw many [[Smithsonian]] displays and exhibitions, for the museum itself and for expositions around the world; Goode's first of these were the preparations for the [[Philadelphia Centennial Exposition]], for which the Smithsonian was responsible for all the government displays. He also served as the assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in charge of the [[United States National Museum]].

Goode effectively ran both the fish research program of the U.S. Fish Commission and the Smithsonian Institution from 1873 to 1887. He was the [[National Fish Hatchery System|United States Commissioner for Fish and Fisheries]] from 1887 to 1888. He authored many books and monographs and wrote more than 100 scientific reports and notes.&lt;ref&gt;http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/historymakers/goode/welcome.html#admin&lt;/ref&gt;

Goode was a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He received from the Queen Regent of Spain the decoration of Commander in the Royal Order of Ysabel la Catolica. He also was awarded the degree of Ph.D. from [[Indiana University]] and that of LL.D. from Wesleyan University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history50states.com/IN-Floyd-New_Albany |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711171354/http://www.history50states.com/IN-Floyd-New_Albany |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at [[Lanier Heights]] in Washington, D.C., on September 6, 1896, at the age of only 45, after a bout with pneumonia. He had been at work on a history of the Smithsonian's first fifty years, which were being celebrated in 1896. The then head of the Smithsonian, [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]], completed the volume and wrote a memorial to Goode, published in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/A_memorial_of_George_Brown_Goode.html?id=DfUQAAAAIAAJ Langley, Samuel P. (1901). ''A Memorial of George Brown Goode: together with a selection of his papers on museums and on the history of science in America.'' (Washington: Government Printing Office)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eponymy==
The [[genus]] ''[[Goodea]]'' of [[splitfin]]s was named in his honour by [[David Starr Jordan]] in 1880; this in turn gave his name to the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Goodeidae]].

Species named after him include:

The '''Golden Age of Freethought''' describes the socio-political movement promoting [[freethought]] that developed in the mid 19th-century [[United States]]. The period roughly from 1875 to 1914 is referred to as "the high-water mark of freethought as an influential movement in American society".&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby, Susan. ''Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism.'' New York, NY: Metropolitan Books ({{ISBN|0-8050-7776-6}}), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; It began around 1856 and lasted at least through the end of the century; author [[Susan Jacoby]] places the end of the Golden Age at the start of [[World War I]].

Freethought is a philosophical position that holds that ideas and opinions should be based on science and reason, and not restricted by authority, tradition, or religion.&lt;ref&gt;https://ffrf.org/shop/nontracts/what-is-a-freethinker&lt;/ref&gt;  The Golden Age was encouraged by the lectures of the extremely popular agnostic orator [[Robert G. Ingersoll]], the popularization of [[Charles Darwin]]’s ''[[Origin of Species]]'', the push for women’s [[suffrage]], and other political, scientific, and social trends that clashed with religious orthodoxy and caused people to question their traditional ideas about the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://donswaim.com/bierce-ingersoll.html&lt;/ref&gt;

With this movement came a devoted group of “freethinkers”. A [[Freethought|Freethinker]] is someone who does not believe in the driving force of religion or the strict word of the bible. They may be considered [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] and do not believe in specific religious hierarchy. A freethinker of the late 19th century could have been someone from any of the varied religious and political backgrounds.

[[Charles Knowlton]], [[D. M. Bennett]], and [[Robert G. Ingersoll]] were influential freethinkers in the Golden Age of Freethought in the mid-late 19th century.

[[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Green Ingersoll]] (1833–1899) was one of the more prominent freethinkers of his time. He was known as the “Great Agnostic”. An [[agnostic]] person would be one who neither believes nor disbelieves in a religious deity. Ingersoll, a lawyer, an orator and  a [[Civil war|Civil War]] veteran, is famous for his skeptical approaches to popular religious beliefs. He would speak in public about orthodox views and would often poke fun. Guests would pay $1 to hear him speak. A dollar in his day was a hefty sum.  Ingersoll was the leader of the [[American Secular Union]], successor organization to the [[National Liberal League (United States)|National Liberal League]].

Charles Knowlton was born into a [[Puritan]] household in the year 1800. The science and medicine practiced around this time was known as “heroic”. [[Heroic medicine|Heroic Medicinal]] treatment was rather medieval and consisted of blood-letting, vomiting and profuse sweating. These “treatments” actually proved harmful to the patients. Knowlton had wet dreams in his adolescence, leading him to be the subject of all types of heroic treatments. He fantasized about proper humane treatment. He believed that in order for treatment to be effective and healthy, one must be proficient in the understanding of human anatomy. He began robbing graves and studying the patients within them. This would later get him wound up in jail. He was released and determined as ever to finish his quest. He later became a doctor, putting his scientific findings into his practice. He would later marry into a family of freethinkers. He wrote “Elements of Modern Materialism” and “Fruits of Philosophy” in 1832. The second would prove much more successful. The book included a spermicidal method which he invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Knowlton | first = Charles | editor-last1 = Besant | editor-first1 = Annie | editor-last2 = Bradlaugh| editor-first2 = Charles | author-link = Charles Knowlton | editor-link1 = Annie Besant | editor-link2 = Charles Bradlaugh | title = Fruits of philosophy: a treatise on the population question | publisher = Reader's Library | location = San Francisco | date = October 1891 | origyear = 1840 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38185/38185-h/38185-h.htm | oclc = 626706770}} A publication about birth control.

Author [[Susan Jacoby]] backs up these claims in her published work “Freethinkers: A History of American Secularism” and “The Age of American Unreason”.

These writers and scholars left the American people with a wide, earthly view on spiritual and political matters. With such a bright, independent community, the [[American government|American Government]] began to feel threatened. The [[Russian revolution|Russian Revolution]] and the scare of [[Communism]] in the early 20th century would soon come about, and with that the force of religious and government backed opposition. Some members of the Freethought Movement were [[atheist]]s, giving [[Christianity|Christians]] plenty of leverage to convince the people that they were un-American. This put the Golden Age of Freethought to rest.{{citation needed|reason=undocumented assertions in this paragraph|date=December 2015}}

Lawton may have been born around 1837,&lt;ref name="Quarles"&gt;Quarles (1953) The Negro in the Civil War. p.89.&lt;/ref&gt; although, most details of her life, before and after the [[American Civil War]], are unknown.

==Baltimore assassination plot against Abraham Lincoln== 
Hattie Lawton, along with fellow female Pinkerton detective [[Kate Warne]], worked with other Pinkerton agents who actively participated in the detection of the alleged 1861 [[Baltimore Plot|Baltimore assassination plot]] against [[President-elect]] [[Abraham Lincoln]].

==American Civil War==
During the American Civil War, Hattie Lawton continued to work with the Pinkerton Detective Agency.  According to Pinkerton's account, in the early part of 1861, Lawton was stationed in [[Perryville, Maryland]], with [[Timothy Webster]], another Pinkerton agent.&lt;ref name="Cuthbert4"/&gt;

After Pinkerton began his "Secret Service" for Gen. [[George B. McClellan]], Lawton and Webster were added to the payroll of the Pinkerton's service in Washington on August 8, 1861.&lt;ref name="Fishel"/&gt; Lawton again posing as [[Timothy Webster]]'s wife appeared in [[Richmond, Virginia]] in the early part of 1862.&lt;ref name="Fishel148"&gt;
Fishel(1996) The Secret War for The Union. p.148.
&lt;/ref&gt; The two were sent by Pinkerton to Richmond to gather intelligence about Confederate army movements.

===Arrest and imprisonment===
Hattie Lawton tended to Timothy Webster when he fell ill at the [[Monument Hotel]] in Richmond, which prevented intelligence reports from being sent back to Allan Pinkerton.&lt;ref name="Fishel148"/&gt; John Scobell, an [[African American]] Union spy, worked with the "twenty-five-year-old beauty", Hattie Lawton, during this time, posing as her servant.&lt;ref name="Quarles"/&gt;

Allan Pinkerton sent two agents, [[Pryce Lewis]] and John Scully, to [[Richmond, Virginia]], to find out what happened to Webster and Lawton. They found Webster and Lawton, but Lewis and Scully were recognized as Pinkerton agents, arrested and later released as part of a prisoner exchange on March 18, 1863.&lt;ref name="Fishel597"&gt;
Fishel (1996) The Secret War for The Union. p.597.&lt;/ref&gt; Various sources indicate that one or both of the men, either to save their own lives or after being tricked, revealed the identity of Webster.  Webster and Lawton were arrested and after a quick trial both were found guilty. 
 
[[File:CastleThunder.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Castle Thunder (prison)|Castle Thunder Prison]], [[Richmond, Virginia]], 1865.]]

Timothy Webster was sentenced to death and executed, on April 29, 1862.&lt;ref name="United States"&gt;United States. (2005). Intelligence in the Civil War.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lawton was sentenced to one year in [[Castle Thunder (prison)|Castle Thunder prison]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. In Confederate records, Lawton was described as "Mrs. Timothy Webster", one of a party of four Federals, exchanged for [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] spy [[Belle Boyd]], on December 13, 1862.&lt;ref name="Fishel597"/&gt;

During her imprisonment, Richmond's most accomplished Union spy, [[Elizabeth Van Lew]], visited Hattie Lawton, but it is unclear whether Van Lew was aware of the real identity of "Mrs. Timothy Webster".&lt;ref name="Rhoades"/&gt;

==Post-war years and death==
After, her release from prison, nothing is known about what happened to Hattie Lawton or when she died.

'''Hispania Citerior''' (English: "Hither Iberia", or "Nearer Iberia") was a Roman Province in [[Hispania]] during the [[Roman Republic]]. It was on the eastern coast of Iberia down to the town of Cartago Nova, today's [[Cartagena, Spain]] in the autonomous community of [[Murcia]], [[Spain]]. It roughly covered today's Spanish autonomous communities of [[Catalonia]] and [[Valencian Community|Valencia]]. Further south there was the Roman Province of [[Hispania Ulterior]] ("Further Iberia"), being further away from Rome. The two provinces were formed in 197 BC, four years after the end of the Second Punic War (218-201 BC). During this war Scipio Africanus defeated the Carthaginians at the [[Battle of Ilipa]] (near Seville) in 206 BC. This led to the Romans taking over the Carthaginian possessions in southern Spain and on the east coast up to the River [[Ebro]]. Several governors of Hispania Citerior commanded wars against the [[Celtiberians]] who lived to the west of this province. In the late first century BC [[Augustus]] reorganised the Roman provinces in Hispania and Hispania Citerior was replaced by the larger province of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], which included the territories the Romans had conquered in central, northern and north-western Hispania. Augustus also renamed Hispania Ulterior Hispania Baetica and created a third province, [[Hispania Lusitania]].

==Etymology==
Hispania is the Latin term given to the [[Iberian peninsula]]. The term can be traced back to at least 200 BC by the poet [[Quintus Ennius]]. The word is possibly derived from the [[Punic]] אי שפן "I-Shaphan" meaning "coast of [[hyraxes]]", in turn a misidentification on the part of [[Phoenicia]]n explorers of its numerous [[rabbit]]s as hyraxes. According to ancient historian [[Cassius Dio]], the people of the region came from many different tribes, not sharing a common language nor a common government.&lt;ref&gt;Dio, Cassius. ''Roman History''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ioannis Theofanidis''' ({{lang-el|Ιωάννης Θεοφανίδης}}) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[Hellenic Navy|Navy]] officer and scholar.

After studies in the [[Hellenic Navy Academy]], Theofanidis served during the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1897]] and the [[Balkan Wars]] (where he was adjutant to the Greek fleet commander, [[Pavlos Kountouriotis]]), finally retiring as a Rear Admiral in 1923.

Having taught history in the Navy Academy, Theofanidis dedicated himself to historical research thereafter, editing publishing the archives of his wife's great-great-grandfather, the hero of the [[Greek Revolution]] [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]], studies on the history of the Greek Navy in the periods 1824–26 (''Ο Αγών της Ανεξαρτησίας, Ιστορία του ελληνικού ναυτικού. Σεπτέμβριος 1824 - Απρίλιος 1826: Νεόκαστρον-Καφηρεύς-Αλεξάνδρεια-Μεσολόγγιον'', 1932) and 1909–13 (''Ιστορία του Ελληνικού Ναυτικού 1909-1913: μετ'εικόνων και χαρτών'', 1923), on the downfall of [[Napoleon]] after the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (''Η Πτώσις του Ναπολέοντος: η γαλλική Βουλή μετά το Βατερλώ-"Βελερεφόντης"-"Νορθούμπερλαντ"-Αγία Ελένη'', 1933) and on his campaign in Syria against [[Sir Sidney Smith]] (''Ναπολέων - Σερ Σίδνεϋ Σμιθ'', 1929).

In the 1920s he came across and became obsessed with the study of the [[Antikythera mechanism]], selling off family property to finance his research into reconstructing a model of the device. He published a first set of his findings in 1934, but most of his work remained unpublished and unknown after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Marchant |first=Jo |title=Decoding the Heavens: Solving the Mystery of the World's First Computer |date=6 November 2008 |publisher=William Heinemann Ltd.|isbn=0-434-01835-X | pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his wife, Aikaterini Ioannidou, he had two children, a daughter Elli and a son, Iason, who also became a naval officer.

'''James Bennett Griffin''' (also known as Jimmy Griffin) (January 12, 1905 – May 17, 1997) was an American [[archaeologist]]. He is regarded as one of the most influential archaeologists in [[North America]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Richard I.|date=2002-01-01|title=James Bennett Griffin, 1905-97|jstor=684012|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=104|issue=2|pages=635–637|doi=10.1525/aa.2002.104.2.635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Born in [[Atchison, Kansas]], the son of Charles and Maude Griffin, Jimmy and his family subsequently moved to [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. His father was a supplier for railroad equipment. Griffin's interest in [[archaeology]] was born through reading as a child and his love for visiting museums.  When Jimmy was eleven his family moved to [[Oak Park, Illinois]], where he lived until he enrolled in college.  He attended Oak Park schools and was a cheerleader at [[Oak Park and River Forest High School]].   At school in Oak Park he met [[Fred Eggan]] and [[Wendell Bennett]]. His friendship with these two schoolmates would last into graduate school and his professional career in [[anthropology]]. In 1933, he married Ruby Fletcher. They had three children: John, David, and James. Griffin retired in 1976 and remained in [[Ann Arbor]] for several years. His wife died in 1979, and in 1984, he moved to [[Washington D.C.]] He met Mary Dewitt there and soon married her. They spent twelve years together living in Washington before Griffin’s death in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] aged 92.

==Education==

Griffin attended and graduated from Oak Park and River Forest High School where he became a champion swimmer, as well as cheer leader. He then enrolled into the [[University of Chicago]] in 1923 where he initially planned on studying Business Administration. After two years in the BA program, he transferred to the program of General Science. He graduated with his [[bachelor's degree]] in 1927. After graduating, Griffin took a brief break from school to work for [[Amoco]], but later returned to the University of Chicago. In 1930, he graduated with a [[Master of Arts]] Degree in [[Sociology]] and Anthropology.  In 1936 he was awarded a special Ph.D. in anthropology from the University of Michigan, as the department there did not yet have a formal Ph.D. program.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, James Bennett

==Professional career==

Griffin accepted a [[research fellowship]] in 1933 at the [[University of Michigan]]. That same year, he moved to Ann Arbor, where he would live for the next five decades. His first fieldwork was conducted in the summer of 1929, where he excavated at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110724031620/http://www.recreationparks.net/IL/adams/indian-mounds-park-quincy Parker Heights Mound] near [[Quincy, Illinois]], a project led by [[William Krogman]]. By 1931, Griffin had gained enough experience in the field to conduct his own excavations. He led an excavation of [[Upper Susquehanna Valley]], [[Pennsylvania]], for the [http://www.tiogapointmuseum.com/ Tioga Point Museum]. The following season, the project had to be postponed due to budget cuts caused by the depression. Griffin spent the season writing a manuscript about the summer spent excavating the [[Parker Heights Mound]] a few years earlier. However, this manuscript was not published until 1991 by the [[Center for American Archeology]] in [[Kampsville, Illinois]].
In the fall of 1939, Griffin accompanied [[James A. Ford]] and [[Philip Phillips (archaeologist)|Philip Phillips]] on the start of a Lower Mississippi survey project. In 1945, he was appointed Associate Professor of Archaeology at Michigan. Four years later, he became a full professor. Between 1940 and 1946, Griffin spent nearly three field seasons working on surface surveys, while his partner Phillips worked on stratigraphic excavations at sites in the southeast, work published in 1951 in a monograph that has come to be regarded as a classic in American Archaeology, [http://openlibrary.org/b/OL3685252M/Archaeological-survey-in-the-Lower-Mississippi-Alluvial-Valley%2C-1940-1947 Archeological Survey In the [[Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley]], 1940-1947] (Phillips, Ford and Griffin 1951) After this project, Griffin began work with [http://archaeology.about.com/od/archaeologistss/g/spauldinga.htm A. C. Spaulding] on the [[Central Mississippi Survey]] in 1950. Fieldwork was done in southeast [[Missouri]] and at the Roots site near the [[Kaskaskia River]], but the main project was at [[Cahokia]]. These projects continued for a few more years, but Griffin stepped down as the leader of them in the mid-1950s. Griffin also conducted work in Europe, Mexico, and the former [[Soviet Union]].

Griffin’s primary involvement in field activities shifted to a broader synthetic study and overview of archaeology itself. However, he still was involved with fieldwork. Between the years of 1963 and 1964, Griffin supervised an excavation at the [http://www.michigan.gov/hal/0,1607,7-160-15481_19267_20424-54607--,00.html Norton Mound group], a [[Hopewell Tradition]]-related site in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. Soon after this, one of Griffins students, [http://www.archaeology.org/0601/abstracts/earthquakes.html James E. Price], encouraged him to return to the northern end of the Lower Mississippi Valley with the [https://books.google.com/books?id=sBz7po9SE7sC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=powers+phase+project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LO-3Nm7Aqs&amp;sig=xyE8LmHRW3JMdWLCPcXpShRsIHc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3HCTSpCALMvUlAel0fybDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=powers%20phase%20project&amp;f=false Powers Phase] project in southeast Missouri (1968–1972). The involvement with this site helped graduate students gain experience in new collecting and field techniques.

Though Griffin is known as a superb field and technical research archaeologist, he was also a distinguished professor whose teaching abilities inspired many of his students throughout the years to become archaeologists as well. He helped train dozens of North American archaeologists, many of whom went on to prominence themselves.  His legacy as a professor was that in the 1970s and 1980s, many of the major archaeological graduate programs in North America were staffed by Griffin’s students. Even now, most archaeologists who focus on [[Eastern Woodlands]] prehistory are linked to Griffin or one or more of his students in some way. Those who knew him personally said he had an extraordinary ability to teach, and that his students worked hard to gain his respect. In addition to his teaching at Michigan, he served as a visiting professor at many schools, including the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1960, the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] in 1962, and [[Louisiana State University]] in 1971.

Throughout his career, Griffin was a regular participant at conferences and meetings of numerous professional organizations. His record of attendance was extraordinary at both the [[Society for American Archaeology]] meetings (which he helped found in 1934) and the [http://www.southeasternarchaeology.org/ Southeastern Archaeological Conference] (which he founded with [[James A. Ford]] in 1937). He highly sought after by symposium organizers as a presenter or discussant.  Griffin was well known for his extraordinary memory of the tens of thousands of artifacts he had seen in collections from all over [[Eastern North America]]—making connections between an artifact in one collection to another artifact he may have examined many years earlier at another institution. His ability to make these connections across space and time often yielded dramatic insights from a single photographic slide or presented paper. He was also known for his a sharp wit and his devastatingly sarcastic and thoroughly non-PC sense of humor, which he used to great effect. He could be a merciless critic of what he considered poorly done archaeology or sloppy scholarship, both verbally and in print.  Most notably, he was embroiled in a long and antagonistic intellectual relationship with the next reigning lion in American archaeology, [[Lewis R. Binford]].

Griffin retired from Michigan in 1976, but eight years later, he moved to Washington D.C. to become associated with the Department of Anthropology at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] until he died in 1997.

==Accomplishments and awards==
Griffin received the [[Axel Wenner-Gren|Viking Fund]] Award and Medal in Archaeology in 1957 from the [[Wenner Grenn Foundation]].  He was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1968. He received the [[University of Michigan's Faculty Achievement Award]] in 1971; the same year he received an [[Honorary Doctorate]] from [[Indiana University]]. The University of Michigan honored him with the [[Henry Russell Lectureship for Outstanding Research]] in 1972.  The [[Society for American Archaeology]] awarded Griffin the [[Fryxell Award]] for excellence in interdisciplinary research in 1980 and the Distinguished Service Award in 1984.

He served as the director of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100210203309/http://www.lsa.umich.edu/umma Museum of Anthropology of Michigan] from 1946-1975. He organized and managed the [[Ceramic Repository for the Eastern United States]], a central source of information and collections about prehistoric pottery based out of the University of Michigan. He and H.R. Crane founded the University’s [[Radiocarbon]] Laboratory that was in operation from 1949-1970. He served many years in the [[Council of the International Union of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences]]. He was considered the premier Eastern North American ceramics expert by many of his colleagues. He wrote more than 260 articles and eight books about ceramics and applying other sciences to archaeology. Altogether, Griffin was among the most honored archaeologists of his generation.

'''Joshua Thomas''' (1719–1797) was a Welsh writer and [[Particular Baptist]] minister, known for his history of Welsh Baptists.

==Life==
He was the eldest son of Morgan Thomas of Tyhên in the parish of [[Caio, Carmarthenshire]], where he was born on 22 February 1719. In 1739 he was apprenticed to his uncle, Simon Thomas, who was a mercer and independent minister at [[Hereford]]. Simon Thomas was the author of works in Welsh and in English, mostly printed at a private press of his own, including ''Hanes y Byd a'r Amseroedd'', a summary of [[universal history]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Thomas, Joshua|volume=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1746 Joshua Thomas married and settled in business at [[Hay, Breconshire]], where he preached occasionally at the Baptist chapel of [[Maesyberllan]], where he was appointed co-pastor in 1749. In 1754 he undertook the pastorship of the Baptist church in [[Leominster]], where he kept a day-school until his death.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Thomas died at Leominster on 25 August 1797.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Works==
Thomas's major work was his history of the Baptists in Wales, published in 1778 under the title ''Hanes y Bedyddwyr ymhlith y Cymry, o amser yr Apostolion hyd y flwyddyn hon'', Carmarthen. A supplement of corrections and additions was also issued in 1780. The author's own manuscript translation into English of this work, with additions, was preserved in the Baptists' Library in [[Bristol]]. Thomas subsequently wrote, in English, ''A History of the Baptist Association in Wales'', which first appeared in the ''Baptist Register'' between 1791 and 1795, and was published in book form in the latter year (London). These two works were sources of information on the early history of the Baptist denomination in Wales. A new edition of the Welsh history, with additions, was brought out by Benjamin Davies of [[Pontypridd]] in 1885.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Thomas alsotranslated into Welsh works dealing with Baptist doctrines, including:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

* ''Dr. Gill's Reply to the Arguments for Infant Baptism, advanced by Griffith Jones of Llanddowror'', with some additions by Thomas himself, 1751.
* ''Tystiolaeth y Credadyn am ei hawl i'r Nefoedd'', 1757. 
* ''Samuel Ewer's Reply to Edward Hitchin on Infant Baptism'', with additions by Thomas, Carmarthen, 1767.
* ''Robert Hall's Doctrine of the Trinity'', Carmarthen, 1794.

==Family==
As many as eleven members of Thomas's family entered the Baptist ministry. His son Timothy Thomas (1753–1827) was for 47 years pastor of the church at [[Devonshire Square]], Bishopsgate. Two of Joshua's brothers, Timothy (1720–1768) and Zechariah (1727–1816), were successively pastors of [[Aberduar]] church, Carmarthenshire. The former was the author or translator of several doctrinal works in Welsh, and a volume of hymns (1764).&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Laupheim''' ({{IPA-de|ˈlaʊphaɪm}}) is a [[Große Kreisstadt|major district town]] in southern Germany in the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]]. Laupheim was first mentioned in 778 and gained [[German town law|city rights]] in 1869. One of the main trading routes, from [[Ulm]] to [[Ravensburg]] and then on towards [[Lake Constance]] ran through Laupheim. Having developed from a rural settlement into a small urban area, Laupheim is home to a number of small to medium-sized industries and businesses. One of the largest employers are the [[Bundeswehr|German Armed Forces]] which maintain an [[Military airbase|airbase]] close to Laupheim, [[Laupheim Air Base]].

Laupheim was the administrative centre of the [[Districts of Germany|district]] of Laupheim from 1842 until 1938 when the district was abolished. The southern parts of it were incorporated into the [[Biberach (district)|district of Biberach]] (including Laupheim itself) whereas the remainders were allocated to the district of Ulm.

In the second half of the 19th century Laupheim was home to the largest [[Jew]]ish community in the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]].

Laupheim is the educational centre for the surrounding rural areas particularly with regards to secondary education.

== Geography ==
[[File:Rottum in Laupheim 03.JPG|thumb|right|River Rottum in Laupheim with railway bridge in the background]]
Laupheim is situated in the region of [[Upper Swabia]] approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Biberach an der Riß|Biberach]] and 20&amp;nbsp;km south of Ulm on the [[Bundesstraße 30]]. Laupheim is the second largest city in the district of Biberach. The original settlement of Laupheim was located close to the [[Rottum (river)|Rottum]] which still runs through the city but since 1950 the city has expanded and sprawls onto the surrounding slopes.

With effect of 1 Januar 2016 Laupheim has been awarded the status of major district town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ray | first = Roland | author-link = | title = Laupheim wird Große Kreisstadt| newspaper = Schwäbische Zeitung | pages = | date = 14 October 2015 | language = German | url = http://www.schwaebische.de/region_artikel,-Laupheim-wird-Grosse-Kreisstadt-_arid,10321983_toid,371.html | accessdate = 25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elevation within the city confines ranges from 509&amp;nbsp;m (1670&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level at the bottom of the valley to 539&amp;nbsp;m (1768&amp;nbsp;ft) in the outlying suburban areas.&lt;ref name="Laupheim in Zahlen"&gt;{{Citation|last =|first =|author-link =|last2 =|first2 =|author2-link =|title = Laupheim in Zahlen|language = German|url = https://www.laupheim.de/index.php?id=53 |accessdate = 2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the city of Laupheim itself, the following once autonomous villages nowadays belong administratively to Laupheim: Baustetten (population 2121), Obersulmetingen (population 1389), [[Untersulmetingen]] (population 2082) and [[Bihlafingen]] (population 853) which, with an elevation of 580&amp;nbsp;m (1903&amp;nbsp;ft), has the highest elevation of the administrative area.&lt;ref name="Laupheim in Zahlen" /&gt;

== History ==
The area in and around Laupheim has been settled from very early times onwards. [[Archaeological]] evidence shows that 15000 years ago [[nomadic]] [[tribe]]s roamed the countryside. From ca. 2000 BCE onwards, [[Celts]] inhabited this area. From the first century [[Common Era|CE]] until around the year 260 CE, it was part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Raetia]], after which the [[Alamanni]] invaded the ''[[Agri Decumates]]'', eventually also settling in the area that was to become Laupheim. During [[Archaeology|archaeological]] excavations in 1840-1842 graves dating from the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] period were discovered in the northern part of the town. &lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} K. Diemer, ''Laupheim'', p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

Laupheim was first mentioned as ''Louphaim'' in a charter dated 778.&lt;ref&gt;''Wirtembergisches Urkundenbuch'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The [[charter]] is still kept in the [[archive]]s of the [[monastery]] of [[St Gallen]], Switzerland. This reference is the earliest of any city in Upper Swabia and any parish in the district of Biberach.

Situated in the vicinity of two major [[trade route]]s between the [[Lake of Constance]] and Ulm and the [[Swabian Alb]] and the [[valley]] of the river [[Iller]] respectively, Laupheim developed into a major settlement. In 853, it was elevated to the status of town when a [[court]] responsible for the ''[[Rammachgau]]'' (also spelled ''Rammagau'') was set up there.

During the 9th century, parts of Laupheim came into the possession of the [[monastery]] of [[Wissembourg|Weißenburg]] which was afterwards passed on to successive minor Swabian aristocratic houses.

As early as the 10th century, Laupheim possessed a [[parish church]] with subsidiaries. In 926, Laupheim and its surroundings were destroyed by the [[Hungarians#History after 900|Hungarians]]. A [[castle]] is mentioned around the year 1100.

Laupheim appears to have been home of an indigenous noble family, whose members used the suffix ''von Laupheim.'' They were attested for the first time in 1110 with Landoldus de Lobhein and seemed to have been in service of the counts of [[Illerkirchberg|Kirchberg]]. The last known member of this family was Berchtolt von Laupheim who was a citizen of Ulm 1372,&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} K. Diemer, ''Laupheim'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; long after his family has lost possession of any rights in Laupheim around 1310.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} J.G. Brigel, ''Statistisch-Geschichtliche Beschreibung...'', p. 92f.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the Empire of the [[Hohenstaufen|Staufers]] during the 13th century, the castle and parish of Laupheim came into the possession of the [[seneschal|Truchsessen]] von [[Waldburg]] who, in 1331, sold Laupheim together with their other possessions in Upper Swabia to the [[Austrians|Austrian]] House of [[Habsburg]].

The Habsburgs [[mortgage loan|mortgaged]] Laupheim in 1334 to the [[Freiherr|barons]] von Ellerbach and [[enfeoffment|enfeoffed]] this baronial family in 1407 with castle, town and [[jus patronatus|patronage]] of the church.

The village was badly affected by the crisis of the mid 14th century, caused by the [[Black Death]] and other factors. The population shrunk and as a consequence the [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Ringelhausen]], situated between Laupheim and Bronnen, was abandoned and eventually lost in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Landesarchivdirektion Baden-Württemberg in Verbindung mit dem Landkreis Biberach | title = Der Landkreis Biberach | place = Sigmaringen | publisher = Jan Thorbecke Verlag | series = | volume = 2 | origyear = | year = 1990 | page = 314 | pages = | language = German | isbn = 3-7995-6186-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the name of a street and a development area in the city of Laupheim nowadays hints at the existence of this hamlet.

The Herren von Ellerbach had [[Saint Leonard of Noblac|St Leonhard's]] Chapel built in 1448, which soon became a place of [[pilgrimage]].

In 1430, Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] bestowed upon Burkhard von Ellerbach the right to hold regular markets, Laupheim thereby becoming a [[market town]], and also the privilege of inflicting [[high justice]], which gave him the right to hold a [[Criminal law|criminal]] court inflicting bodily punishment, including the death penalty. The local ruler was now master of life and death. Due to the weekly market and the annual [[Saint Gall|Gallus]]-market, Laupheim quickly developed into a commercial centre.

During the course of the [[German Peasants' War]] 1525, Laupheim Castle was destroyed by the [[Baltringer Haufen]], an army of [[peasants]] named after the nearby village of [[Baltringen]], where approximately 12.000 farmers gathered to form an army. After the suppression of the revolt, the peasants were forced to rebuild the castle.

After the [[Agnatic seniority|agnatic]] line of the [[Ellerbach (disambiguation)|Ellerbach]] [[dynasty]] became extinct in 1570, Laupheim passed through [[Hans Pankraz von Freyberg]] to the Herren von [[Welden (dynasty)|Welden]] in 1582. They turned Laupheim into their permanent [[seat of government|residence]] and established the first school in 1584. From 1582 until 1806, Laupheim was a Lordship (''Reichsritterschaft'') ruled by the heir of the Welden family, whose title was "[[Imperial Knight]]" (''Reichsritter'').
[[File:Laupheim Spital.jpg|thumb|right|Former Hospital of the Holy Spirit]]

In 1596, the right to bear a [[coat of arms]] was given to Laupheim, showing the colours of green, white and red together with three leaves on a three hills, thereby incorporating the coat-of-arms of the family of Welden with the three leaves, referring to the name of the town on the hills of the valley of the river Rottum.

The last member of the House of Ellerbach, [[Anna von Freyberg]], founded the Hospital of the [[Holy Spirit]] in 1601, the building of which still exists and now functions as a [[retirement home]].

Between 1623 and 1661, the church St. Peter and Paul was built in the vicinity of the castle.

Due to the inheritance laws of the house of Welden, the market town was divided into two different territories, ''Großlaupheim'' and ''Kleinlaupheim'' (''Great Laupheim'' and ''Little Laupheim''), in 1621, at the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), each territory being ruled by its own dynasty. As a consequence economic growth slowed down.
[[File:Adel im Wandel52.jpg|thumb|right|Laupheim 1726 with [[Großlaupheim Castle]] on the left and [[Kleinlaupheim Castle]] at the top]]
During the [[Thirty Years' War]], Laupheim repeatedly fell victim to the ravages of war, mainly due to marauding troops, both [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]], that is Catholic, and [[Sweden|Swedish]], their [[Protestant]] opponents. A massive [[outbreak]] of the [[bubonic plague]] in 1635 further diminished the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} K. Diemer, ''Laupheim'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; At the close of the Thirty Years' War, Laupheim had lost two-thirds of its pre-war population, so that ultimately towards the end of the 17th century, Laupheim had sunk to the status of an unimportant, impoverished village. As a consequence of the Thirty Years' War, the feudal lords attempted to increase taxation and extend the amount of socage the peasants had to do for them. This led to legal conflicts between the two parties, which lasted for decades.

[[File:Laupheim Judenberg 2.JPG|thumb|right|''Judenberg'' in Laupheim]]
In order to stimulate the local economy and income generated by taxation, [[Carl Damian von Welden]] allowed the first [[Jewish]] families to settle in Großlaupheim in the 1720s. This which was made possible by a contract, protecting the [[Jews]]. The Jews were made to settle in an area of the town soon to be called ''Judenberg'' (literally ''Jews' mountain'' or ''Jews' hill''). Subsequently, a [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarter]] evolved, with a cemetery, synagogue, school and a [[Rabbi]]'s office.&lt;ref&gt;
Georg Schenk, "Die Juden in Laupheim", in: K. Diemer, ''Laupheim'', p. 286ff&lt;/ref&gt;
{{main article|History of the Jews in Laupheim}}
During the 18th century, the Welden dynasty had the old castle, ''[[Großlaupheim Castle]]'', restored, and subsequently renewed in [[Baroque]]-style in 1752. Between 1766 and 1769, the branch of the Welden dynasty that ruled Kleinlaupheim had their residence renewed in [[Baroque]]-style by architect [[Johann Georg Specht]]. This castle is now called ''Schloss Kleinlaupheim'' ([[Kleinlaupheim Castle]]). This makes Laupheim unique in that it has two castles within its city boundaries, as a result of once having been two independent states.
[[File:Laupheim Schranne.jpg|thumb|right|Schranne (''granary'')]]

In 1778, a [[town hall]] and the [[granary]] were built in the Upper Market Square.

Following the [[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]], the [[mediatisation]] and [[secularisation]] of numerous secular and [[ecclesiastical]] [[principalities]] within the former [[Holy Roman Empire]], both parts of Laupheim were annexed by the newly formed [[Kingdom of Württemberg]] in 1806. The last ruler of Laupheim was Constantin von Welden. Laupheim first became administratively part of the district of [[Wiblingen]], but in 1845 the district administration was moved to Laupheim, creating the district of Laupheim. The district as abolished in 1938 when Laupheim became part of the district of Biberach.

Due to laws based on the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]], servitude in the Kingdom of Württemberg was abolished in 1836. During the same period, laws forcing Jews to live in separate quarters and excluding them from most business activities were revoked. This enabled them to contribute enormously to the economic upturn Laupheim was experiencing, even though complete civil rights were not granted until 1864.

In 1848, with the arrival of civil servants from the original [[Duchy]] of Württemberg (''Altwürttemberg''), a Protestant parish was founded.

In 1850, a train station opened two kilometers west of Laupheim, on the [[Southern Railway (Württemberg)|railway line Ulm-Friedrichshafen]] from [[Ulm]] to [[Friedrichshafen]], this station therefore being named as [[Laupheim-West]].

In 1869, Laupheim was granted a [[city charter]] by [[Charles, King of Württemberg|King Karl I. of Württemberg]]. In the same year, the first institute of further education, a ''[[Lateinschule]],'' was established in Laupheim. In 1871, Laupheim, being part of the Kingdom of Württemberg, was incorporated into the [[German Empire]].
[[File:Bahnhof-laupheim-1904.jpg|thumb|Laupheim, main train station ca. 1904]]

During the steep economic growth of the [[Gründerzeit]], the period between 1871 and 1914, Laupheim had the highest density of [[public houses]] in the whole Kingdom of Württemberg.

In 1904, the city was connected to the railway line Ulm-Friedrichshafen by a [[branch line]], linking the railway artery with the city itself. At the same time a train station was built in the city. This extension of the railway line went on for a further 16&amp;nbsp;km, terminating at the village of [[Schwendi, Baden-Württemberg|Schwendi]].
{{main article|Railway Line Laupheim - Schwendi}}

Before World War I, Laupheim had one of the largest [[Jewish]] communities in Württemberg. However, the appointment of [[Adolf Hitler]] as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] in 1933 and the systematic deprivation and subsequent suppression of [[Jews]] in Germany, also had their effects on Laupheim, culminating in the destruction by fire of the synagogue during the so-called [[Kristallnacht]] 1938.

Due to the programme of [[Aryanization (Nazism)|aryanization]], many businesses in Laupheim originally owned by [[Jews]], were expropriated and transferred into German ownership.
[[File:Laupheim1915.jpg|thumb|Laupheim ca. 1915]]
126 of 312 Jewish inhabitants of Laupheim managed to flee abroad, most of them after the so-called ''[[Kristallnacht]]''. In 1939, the remaining Jews in Laupheim were resettled within the city, only to be deported to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration]] and [[Extermination camps in the Holocaust|extermination camps]] in 1941 and 1942. After the last of four transports, the Jewish community in Laupheim ceased to exist on 19 August 1942.

Sixty-two Jewish citizens of Laupheim perished in the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]], only two survived.

After [[World War II]], in the 1960s, Laupheim began to renew and modernize its appearance. New schools were built: a [[Gymnasium (school)|grammar school]], a [[realschule]] and a new town hall. From the 1980s onwards, these projects were followed by a new district hospital, a public in-doors swimming pool, a renovated stadium, named after [[Gretel Bergmann]] who was born in Laupheim, and an omnibus [[transport interchange|interchange]].

Additionally, several industrial estates on the outskirts of the city were established in order to attract trade and industry. As a consequence, companies from outside Laupheim established offices and production facilities there, as well as companies that formerly had been operating from the city centre.

Having developed from a rural market town into a city, predominated by industry, trade and the service industries, the demographics of Laupheim have changed as well.

After growing continuously from 1871 until 1933, from the [[Gründerzeit]] until the [[Nazis]] came to power, this development came to a halt. The stagnation and eventual decrease in population was due to increasing persecution of the Jews, as a result of which many Jewish inhabitants left Laupheim or, after 1940, were deported and subsequently murdered.

Since 1945, the population of Laupheim has almost doubled. This is due to the fact that a great number of refugees from [[Historical Eastern Germany|formerly German territories]] east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] were settled in Laupheim.

The establishment of a [[Army Aviation Corps (Germany)|German Army Aviation Corps]] airbase in 1964 further contributed to the growth in population.

After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, an influx of [[ethnic German]]s from the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] added to the population growth.

As of 31 December 2016, the number of non-German inhabitants of Laupheim totals 2768 (12.73% of the total population).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Bevölkerung nach Nationalität - vierteljährlich | work = Landesinformationssystem | publisher = Statistisches Landesamt Baden Württemberg | url = http://www.statistik.baden-wuerttemberg.de/BevoelkGebiet/MigrNation/01035055.tab?R=GS426070 | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy, industry and infrastructure ==

=== Traffic ===
* '''Road''': the western borders of the city itself are marked by the [[Bundesstraße 30]]. Laupheim is connected by three junctions to this federal road. It was planned to upgrade this federal road to [[autobahn]] status, turning it into the [[Bundesautobahn 89|A89]]. These plans were dropped in the early 1980s.
* '''Railway''': the [[Southern Railway (Württemberg)|Württemberg Southern Railway]] (Ulm-Friedrichshafen) passes Laupheim about 2&amp;nbsp;km from the built-up area. [[Laupheim-West]] railway station serves passengers from the surrounding area. From this railway station another line branches off into Laupheim, terminating at the city railway station. It was part of a longer railway line, originally leading to Schwendi. However, during the 1970s and 1980s, the whole extension was gradually closed down, dismantled, and the service replaced by buses. Only the section leading from the city railway station to Laupheim-West remained and was later renovated and re-opened in 1999 with a direct connection to [[Langenau]] via [[Ulm Central Station]]. Passengers travelling south to [[Biberach an der Riß]] still had to change trains at Laupheim-West station. Plans existed, however, to establish direct trains from Laupheim to Biberach an der Riß. In June 2011, after construction works lasting two years a new southern route towards Biberach was opened. In order to facilitate railway traffic a second [[railway platform]] was built at Laupheim city station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bahnaktuell.net/?p=70305|title=Feierliche Eröffnung der neuen Bahnlinie Laupheim Stadt–(Südkurve)–Biberach (Riß)| accessdate =2011-07-30| language = German |publisher=bahnaktuell.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laupheim was home to [[Medium Transport Helicopter Regiment 25]] "Oberschwaben" (Upper Swabia) and Support [[Squadron (aviation)|Squadron]] 10 of the [[Army Aviation Corps (Germany)|German Army Aviation Corps]] (''Heeresflieger''). The German Army Aviation Corps base was established in 1964 utilizing already existing facilities. Medium Transport Regiment 25 was disbanded on 31 December 2012 when personnel and material were transferred to the [[German Air Force]] and re-established as [[Helicopter Wing 64]] on 1 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | title = Wehrbeauftragter besucht die Laupheimer Heeresflieger | newspaper = Schwäbische Zeitung | pages = | date = 28 August 2012 | language = German | url = http://www.schwaebische.de/region/biberach-ulm/laupheim/stadtnachrichten-laupheim_artikel,-Wehrbeauftragter-besucht-die-Laupheimer-Heeresflieger-_arid,5308188.html | accessdate = 11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helicopter Wing 64 is equipped with transport [[helicopter]] [[CH-53 Sea Stallion|CH-53]] and light utility helicopter [[Eurocopter EC145|H145M LUH SOF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wiegold | first = Thomas | authorlink = | title = Mal ein erfolgreiches Rüstungsprojekt: Alle H145M-Hubschrauber bei der Truppe angekommen | work = | publisher = augengeradeaus.net| date = 26 June 2017 | language = German | url = http://augengeradeaus.net/2017/06/alle-h145m-hubschrauber/| format = | doi = | accessdate = 27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; German Army Aviation Corps Support Squadron 10 was equipped with helicopters of the type [[Bölkow Bo 105|Bo-105]]. The unit disbanded in 2007.

Until the beginning of the 1990s the regiment had only seen service in other [[NATO]] countries, mainly while on manoeuvre or on aid-missions after [[natural disasters]]. Since then, however, it has been deployed abroad on various aid-missions and so far has seen service on [[NATO peacekeeping|NATO]] and [[United Nations peacekeeping]] missions, first in [[Iraq]] after the 1st [[Gulf War]], then on the [[Balkans]] with [[IFOR]], [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]], [[SFOR]] and [[EUFOR]], in [[Afghanistan]] as part of [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]], which is ongoing, and most recently in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] as part of [[EUFOR RD Congo]] to support the UN mission [[United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo|MONUC]] to monitor the general elections in 2006. This mission began in June 2006 and ended with the last soldiers returning in December of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ray | first = Roland | author-link = | title = Heeresflieger meistern den Kongo-Einsatz "mit Bravour" | newspaper = Schwäbische Zeitung | pages = | date = 22 December 2006 | language = German | url = http://www.schwaebische.de/home_artikel,-Heeresflieger-meistern-den-Kongo-Einsatz-mit-Bravour-_arid,1834204.html | accessdate = 28 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attractions ==

=== Großlaupheim Castle ===
[[File:Laupheim Schloss Grosslaupheim.jpg|thumb|right|Großlaupheim Castle]]
Großlaupheim Castle is situated on a hill on the verge of the city close to the local parish church.
The existence of a castle in Laupheim was documented for the first time around the year 1100. There is no evidence that the castle originally consisted of more than a wooden structure. This castle existed until the Peasants' War in 1525, when it was destroyed by rebellious peasants. After the end of hostilities, the peasants were forced to rebuild the castle in stone. The structure as it stands today was erected in three different phases:
* The so-called [[Feudal]] Castle ''(Lehenschloss),'' the oldest part, dates from the middle of the 16th century. It consists of a three-storey, square [[edifice]] with two flanking round towers.
* Adjoining it, the so-called New Castle ''(Neues Schloss)'' (built between 1660 and 1680) with an early [[Baroque]] square flanked by [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] and a gateway.
[[File:Laupheim castle Rosengarten.JPG|thumb|right|Baroque rose garden with ''Kleines Schlössle'']]
* Somewhat removed but still part of the complex, the so-called Little Castle (''Kleines Schlössle'') was built in the middle of the 17th century. It was used by the Freiherren von Welden as dwelling place for the widows of former rulers of Laupheim. On a terrace below the castle buildings, a small rose garden was designed in Baroque-style.

=== Museum of the History of Christians and Jews ===
The Museum of the History of Christians and Jews is situated in Großlaupheim Castle. It is unique in Germany in that its collection concentrates on the documentation of the relationship between Christians and Jews on a local level, using Laupheim, which once had the largest Jewish community in the Kingdom of Württemberg, as an example. The exhibition documents in chronological order all aspects of more than 200 years of Jewish life in Laupheim.

=== Castle Park ===
[[File:Laupheim castle park 3.JPG|thumb|right|Castle Park]]
The park is situated at the bottom of the hill on top of which ''Schloss Großlaupheim'' lies. The castle park was designed in the [[Landscape garden|English Style]] by [[Kilian von Steiner]]. A huge number of trees, meadows and lakes created an impressive appearance. Originally, it was well known for its exotic trees and plants. Formerly, there were five lakes, which, during winter, provided a brewery with ice. During summer, the lakes were used for raising [[trout]]. However, in recent times the maintenance of the ground and the lakes was neglected due to a lack of council funding. In recent years efforts have been made to restore the park, at least in parts, to its former glory. In 2011, the park was declared a "Garden Monument' by the state of Baden-Württemberg's National Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ray | first = Roland | author-link = | title = Jetzt kann die Arbeit im Schlosspark beginnen | newspaper = Schwäbische Zeitung | pages = | date = 7 March 2013 | language = German | url = http://www.schwaebische.de/region/biberach-ulm/laupheim/stadtnachrichten-laupheim_artikel,-Jetzt-kann-die-Arbeit-im-Schlosspark-beginnen-_arid,5404150.html | accessdate = 9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kleinlaupheim Castle ===
[[File:Laupheim Schloss Kleinlaupheim.jpg|thumb|right|Kleinlaupheim Castle]]
Kleinlaupheim Castle is situated on a hill south-west of the river Rottum within the city limits of Laupheim.
In its present state it was built between 1766 and 1769 as a place of residence for the ruler of Kleinlaupheim at the time, the [[Freiherr]] [[Joseph Ignaz von Welden-Kleinlaupheim]] (1721–1802). It was designed by [[Johann Georg Specht]] of [[Lindenberg im Allgäu|Lindenberg]] in Baroque-style. It consists of a three-storey building with a curved [[mansard]] roof. [[Pilasters]], [[cornices]] and [[gable]]s enliven the facade of the building. Inside there is a remarkable grand [[staircase]] in the [[Vestibule (Architecture)|vestibule]].

It now houses the local [[police station]] and an [[art gallery]], ''Die Wache Galerie'', a pun on words in that ''Wache'' can mean [[police station]] as well as alert or awake.

[[File:Laupheim St Peter Paul mit Pfarrhaus.jpg|thumb|right|Parish Church St Peter and Paul with rectory]]

=== Parish Church St Peter and Paul ===
The Parish Church St Peter and Paul, built between 1623 and 1661, lies in close proximity to Großlaupheim Castle. It was designed by [[Martino I. Barbieri]] from [[Roveredo]] in Baroque-style, showing influences of [[manierism]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Diemer, ''Laupheim'', p. 160f.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior of the church is decorated with sculptures by [[Dominikus Hermenegild Herberger]] and paintings by [[Johann Georg Bergmüller]].

=== Planetarium and Public Observatory ===
&lt;!-- "Laupheim Observatory" redirects here --&gt;
The [[planetarium]] and public [[astronomical observatory]] of Laupheim ({{lang-de|Volkssternwarte Laupheim|links=no}}) counts about 40000 visitors each year. It is run on a mostly voluntary basis by the club ''Volkssternwarte Laupheim e.V.'' (founded 1975), providing high quality [[astronomy|astronomical]] education. The work of the club has been recognized by astronomer [[Carolyn Shoemaker]], who named the asteroid [[7167&amp;nbsp;Laupheim]] in honour of the institution.

=== The ''Laupheimer Kinder- und Heimatfest'' ===
The annual historical festival, the ''Kinder- und Heimatfest'', takes place during the last weekend of June. It consists of [[processions]] and [[parades]], performed by various groups, incorporating performances in historical costumes, [[concert band]]s and [[Float (parade)|floats]], referring to contemporary and historical events. There is also a [[funfair]], accompanied by several [[pole marquee]]s, as well as much revelling in the bars, [[coffeehouse|cafes]] and [[pubs]] of the city.

=== ''Brunnenfest'' ===
On the last Sunday of the summer holidays, the traditional ''Brunnenfest'' (fountain party) takes place in the city centre. A huge [[street party]], it is concentrated on the Upper and Lower Market Square. The name of the event derives from the [[Poseidon|Neptune]]-fountain, situated in the Upper Market Square. A great number of stalls serves [[Swabia]]n and international [[cuisine]] as well as a large variety of beverages. The stalls are organised and manned by local clubs. [[Concert band]]s, [[Jazz]] bands and [[Volksmusik]] bands entertain visitors. On a stage dance and sport performances are shown. Additionally, a [[flea market]] is held at the same time.

{{Marxism|Sociology}}
'''Karl Marx's theory of alienation''' describes the [[social alienation|estrangement]] (''Entfremdung'') of people from aspects of their ''[[Marx's theory of human nature|Gattungswesen]]'' ("species-essence") as a consequence of living in a society of stratified [[social class]]es. The alienation from the self is a consequence of being a mechanistic part of a social class, the condition of which estranges a person from their humanity.

The theoretic basis of alienation within the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] is that the worker invariably loses the ability to determine life and destiny when deprived of the right to think (conceive) of themselves as the director of their own actions; to determine the character of said actions; to define relationships with other people; and to own those items of value from goods and services, produced by their own labour. Although the worker is an autonomous, self-realized human being, as an economic entity this worker is directed to goals and diverted to activities that are dictated by the [[bourgeoisie]]—who own the [[means of production]]—in order to extract from the worker the maximum amount of [[surplus value]] in the course of business competition among industrialists.

In the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (1932), [[Karl Marx]] expressed the ''Entfremdung'' theory—of estrangement from the self.  Philosophically, the theory of ''Entfremdung'' relies upon ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841) by [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] which states that the idea of a supernatural god has alienated the natural characteristics of the [[human being]]. Moreover, [[Max Stirner]] extended Feuerbach's analysis in ''[[The Ego and its Own]]'' (1845) that even the idea of "humanity" is an alienating concept for individuals to intellectually consider in its full philosophic implication. Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] responded to these philosophic propositions in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1845).

== Types of alienation ==
In a capitalist society, the worker's alienation from their humanity occurs because the worker can only express labour—a fundamental social aspect of personal individuality—through a private system of industrial production in which each worker is an instrument, a thing and not a person. In the "Comment on James Mill" (1844), Marx explained alienation thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;Let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings. Each of us would have, in two ways, affirmed himself, and the other person. (i) In my production I would have objectified my individuality, its specific character, and, therefore, enjoyed not only an individual manifestation of my life during the activity, but also, when looking at the object, I would have the individual pleasure of knowing my personality to be objective, visible to the senses, and, hence, a power beyond all doubt. (ii) In your enjoyment, or use, of my product I would have the direct enjoyment both of being conscious of having satisfied a human need by my work, that is, of having objectified man's essential nature, and of having thus created an object corresponding to the need of another man's essential nature [...] Our products would be so many mirrors in which we saw reflected our essential nature.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. "Comment on James Mill," ''Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844'': 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'' (1932), Marx identified four types of alienation that occur to the worker labouring under a [[capitalism|capitalist]] system of industrial production.&lt;ref&gt;Alienation. ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'': Revised Second Edition (1984), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alienation of the worker from their product ===
The design of the product and how it is produced are determined, not by the producers who make it (the workers), nor by the consumers of the product (the buyers), but by the [[capitalist class]] who besides accommodating the worker's manual labour also accommodate the intellectual labour of the [[engineer]] and the [[industrial designer]] who create the product in order to shape the [[Taste (sociology)|taste]] of the consumer to buy the goods and services at a price that yields a maximal [[profit (economics)|profit]]. Aside from the workers having no control over the design-and-production protocol, alienation (''Entfremdung'') broadly describes the conversion of labour (work as an activity), which is performed to generate a [[use value]] (the product), into a commodity, which—like products—can be assigned an [[exchange value]]. That is, the capitalist gains control of the manual and intellectual workers and the benefits of their labour, with a system of industrial production that converts said labour into concrete products (goods and services) that benefit the consumer. Moreover, the capitalist production system also [[Reification (Marxism)|reifies]] labour into the "concrete" concept of "work" (a job), for which the worker is paid wages—at the lowest-possible rate—that maintain a maximum rate of return on the capitalist's [[investment capital]]; this is an aspect of [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]. Furthermore, with such a reified system of industrial production, the profit (exchange value) generated by the sale of the goods and services (products) that could be paid to the workers is instead paid to the capitalist classes: the functional capitalist, who manages the means of production; and the [[Rentier capitalism|rentier capitalist]], who owns the means of production.

=== Alienation of the worker from the act of production === 
In the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], the generation of products (goods and services) is accomplished with an endless sequence of discrete, repetitive motions that offer the worker little psychological satisfaction for "a job well done". By means of [[commodification]], the [[labor power]] of the worker is reduced to wages (an exchange value); the psychological estrangement (''Entfremdung'') of the worker results from the unmediated relation between his productive labor and the wages paid to him for the labor. The worker is alienated from the means of production via two forms; wage compulsion and the imposed production content. The worker is bound to unwanted labour as a means of survival, labour is not "voluntary but coerced" (forced labor). The worker is only able to reject wage compulsion at the expense of their life and that of their family. The distribution of [[private property]] in the hands of wealth owners, combined with government enforced taxes compel workers to labor. In a capitalist world, our means of survival is based on monetary exchange, therefore we have no other choice than to sell our labour power and consequently be bound to the demands of the capitalist. The worker "[d]oes not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself"; "[l]abor is external to the worker" (p. 74), it is not a part of their essential being. During work, the worker is miserable, unhappy and drained of their energy, work "mortifies his body and ruins his mind". The production content, direction and form are imposed by the capitalist. The worker is being controlled and told what to do since they do not own the means of production they have no say in production, "labor is external to the worker, i.e. it does not belong to his essential being (p. 74). A person's mind should be free and conscious, instead it is controlled and directed by the capitalist, "the external character of labor for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own but someone else's, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another" (p. 74). This means he cannot freely and spontaneously create according to his own directive as labor's form and direction belong to someone else.

=== Alienation of the worker from their ''Gattungswesen'' (species-essence) === 
The ''Gattungswesen'' (species-essence), human nature of individuals is not discrete (separate and apart) from their activity as a worker and as such species-essence also comprises all of innate human potential as a person. Conceptually, in the term "species-essence" the word "species" describes the intrinsic human mental essence that is characterized by a "plurality of interests" and "psychological dynamism", whereby every individual has the desire and the tendency to engage in the many activities that promote mutual human survival and psychological well-being, by means of emotional connections with other people, with society. The psychic value of a human consists in being able to conceive (think) of the ends of their actions as purposeful ideas, which are distinct from the actions required to realize a given idea. That is, humans are able to objectify their intentions by means of an idea of themselves as "the subject" and an idea of the thing that they produce, "the object". Conversely, unlike a human being an animal does not objectify itself as "the subject" nor its products as ideas, "the object", because an animal engages in directly self-sustaining actions that have neither a future intention, nor a [[Consciousness|conscious]] intention. Whereas a person's ''Gattungswesen'' (human nature) does not exist independently of specific, historically conditioned activities, the essential nature of a human being is actualized when an individual—within their given historical circumstance—is free to subordinate their will to the internal demands they have imposed upon themselves by their imagination and not the external demands imposed upon individuals by other people.

==== Relations of production ====
Whatever the character of a person's consciousness ([[Will (philosophy)|will]] and [[imagination]]), societal existence is conditioned by their relationships with the people and things that facilitate survival, which is fundamentally dependent upon co-operation with others, thus, a person's consciousness is determined inter-subjectively (collectively), not subjectively (individually), because humans are a social animal. In the course of history, to ensure individual survival societies have organized themselves into groups who have different, basic relationships to the [[means of production]]. One societal group (class) owned and controlled the means of production while another societal class worked the means of production and in the [[relations of production]] of that ''status quo'' the goal of the owner-class was to economically benefit as much as possible from the labour of the working class. In the course of economic development when a new type of economy displaced an old type of economy—agrarian [[feudalism]] superseded by [[mercantilism]], in turn superseded by the [[Industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]—the rearranged economic order of the social classes favored the social class who controlled the [[Technology|technologies]] (the means of production) that made possible the change in the relations of production. Likewise, there occurred a corresponding rearrangement of the human nature (''Gattungswesen'') and the [[Value system|system of values]] of the owner-class and of the working-class, which allowed each group of people to accept and to function in the rearranged ''status quo'' of production-relations.

Despite the ideological promise of industrialization—that the mechanization of industrial production would raise the mass of the workers from a brutish life of subsistence existence to honorable work—the division of labour inherent to the capitalist mode of production thwarted the human nature (''Gattungswesen'') of the worker and so rendered each individual into a mechanistic part of an industrialized system of production, from being a person capable of defining their value through direct, purposeful activity. Moreover, the near-total mechanization and automation of the industrial production system would allow the (newly) dominant [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] capitalist social class to exploit the working class to the degree that the value obtained from their labour would diminish the ability of the worker to materially survive. Hence, when the proletarian working-class become a sufficiently developed political force, they will effect a revolution and re-orient the [[relations of production]] to the [[means of production]]—from a [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] to a [[communist mode of production]]. In the resultant [[communist society]], the fundamental relation of the workers to the means of production would be equal and non-conflictual because there would be no artificial distinctions about the value of a worker's labour; the worker's humanity (species-essence) thus respected, men and women would not become alienated (see [[Marx's theory of human nature]]).

In the communist socio-economic organization, the relations of production would operate the [[mode of production]] and employ [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|each worker according to their abilities and benefit each worker according to their needs]]. Hence, each worker could direct their labour to productive work suitable to their own innate abilities, rather than be forced into a narrowly defined, [[Wage slavery|minimal-wage]] "job" meant to extract maximal profit from individual labour as determined by and dictated under the capitalist mode of production. In the classless, collectively-managed communist society, the exchange of value between the [[Reification (Marxism)|objectified]] productive labour of one worker and the consumption benefit derived from that production will not be determined by or directed to the narrow interests of a bourgeois capitalist class, but instead will be directed to meet the needs of each producer and consumer. Although production will be differentiated by the degree of each worker's abilities, the purpose of the communist system of industrial production will be determined by the collective requirements of society, not by the profit-oriented demands of a capitalist social class who live at the expense of the greater society. Under the [[collective ownership]] of the means of production, the relation of each worker to the mode of production will be identical and will assume the character that corresponds to the universal interests of the communist society. The direct distribution of the fruits of the labour of each worker to fulfill the interests of the working class—and thus to an individuals own interest and benefit—will constitute an un-alienated state of labour conditions, which restores to the worker the fullest exercise and determination of their human nature.

=== Alienation of the worker from other workers === 
Capitalism reduces the labour of the worker to a commercial [[commodity]] that can be traded in the competitive labour-market, rather than as a constructive socio-economic activity that is part of the collective common effort performed for personal survival and the betterment of society. In a capitalist economy, the businesses who own the [[means of production]] establish a competitive labour-market meant to extract from the worker as much labour (value) as possible in the form of [[capital (economics)|capital]]. The capitalist economy's arrangement of the [[relations of production]] provokes social conflict by pitting worker against worker in a competition for "higher wages", thereby alienating them from their mutual economic interests; the effect is a [[false consciousness]], which is a form of ideological control exercised by the capitalist [[bourgeoisie]] through its [[cultural hegemony]]. Furthermore, in the capitalist mode of production the philosophic collusion of [[religion]] in justifying the [[relations of production]] facilitates the realization and then worsens the alienation (''Entfremdung'') of the worker from their humanity; it is a socio-economic role independent of religion being "[[opiate of the people|the opiate of the masses]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/s3002.htm Marx on Alienation]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical significance ==
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|250px|Philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) postulated the [[idealism]] that Marx countered with [[dialectical materialism]]]]
[[File:Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach.jpg|thumb|250px|Philosopher [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] (1804–1872) analysed religion from a psychological perspective in ''The Essence of Christianity'' (1841) and according to him divinity is humanity's projection of their human nature]]

===  Influences: Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Ludwig Feuerbach ===
In [[Marxist theory]], ''Entfremdung'' ([[social alienation|alienation]]) is a foundational proposition about man's progress towards [[self-actualisation]]. In the ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (2005), Ted Honderich described the influences of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] upon Karl Marx: &lt;blockquote&gt;For Hegel, the unhappy consciousness is divided against itself, separated from its "essence", which it has placed in a "beyond".&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

As used by the philosophers Hegel and Marx, the reflexive German verbs ''entäussern'' ("to divest one's self of") and ''entfremden'' ("to become estranged") indicate that the term "alienation" denotes self-alienation: to be estranged from one's essential nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Langenscheidt New College Dictionary'': German–English/English–German (1973) pp. 166 and 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, alienation is a lack of self-worth, the absence of meaning in one's life, consequent to being coerced to lead a life without opportunity for self-fulfillment, without the opportunity to become actualized, to become one's [[self]].&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, Ted. ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), Hegel described the stages in the development of the human ''[[Geist]]'' ("Spirit"), by which men and women progress from ignorance to knowledge, of the self and of the world. Developing Hegel's human-spirit proposition, Marx said that those poles of [[idealism]]—"spiritual ignorance" and "self-understanding"—are replaced with [[materialism|material categories]], whereby "spiritual ignorance" becomes "alienation" and "self-understanding" becomes man's realisation of his ''Gattungswesen'' (species-essence).

==== ''Entfremdung'' and the theory of history ====
{{see also|Marx's theory of history|Dialectical materialism}}
In Part I: "Feuerbach – Opposition of the Materialist and Idealist Outlook" of ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1846), Karl Marx said the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;Things have now come to such a pass that the individuals must appropriate the existing totality of productive forces, not only to achieve self-activity, but also, merely, to safeguard their very existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marx|first=Karl|title=The German Ideology|date= Fall 1845 to mid-1846|chapter=Part I: Feuerbach. Opposition of the Materialist and Idealist Outlook|chapter-url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01d.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

That humans psychologically require the life activities that lead to their [[self-actualisation]] as persons remains a consideration of secondary historical relevance because the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] eventually will [[Exploitation of labour|exploit]] and impoverish the [[proletariat]] until compelling them to [[social revolution]] for survival. Yet, social alienation remains a practical concern, especially among the contemporary philosophers of [[Marxist humanism]]. In ''The Marxist-Humanist Theory of State-Capitalism'' (1992), [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] discussed and described the existence of the desire for self-activity and self-actualisation among wage-labour workers struggling to achieve the elementary goals of material life in a capitalist economy.

==== ''Entfremdung'' and social class ====
In Chapter 4 of ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' (1845), Marx said that capitalists and proletarians are equally alienated, but that each [[social class]] experiences alienation in a different form: &lt;blockquote&gt;The propertied class and the class of the proletariat present the same human self-estrangement. But the former class feels at ease and strengthened in this self-estrangement, it recognizes estrangement as its own power, and has in it the semblance of a human existence. The class of the proletariat feels annihilated, this means that they cease to exist in estrangement; it sees in it its own powerlessness and in the reality of an inhuman existence. It is, to use an expression of Hegel, in its abasement, the indignation at that abasement, an indignation to which it is necessarily driven by the contradiction between its human nature and its condition of life, which is the outright, resolute and comprehensive negation of that nature. Within this antithesis, the private property-owner is therefore the conservative side, and the proletarian the destructive side. From the former arises the action of preserving the antithesis, from the latter the action of annihilating it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch04.htm Chapter 4 of ''The Holy Family'']- see under Critical Comment No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
In discussion of "random materialism" (''matérialisme aléatoire''), the French philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] criticized such a [[teleology|teleological]] (goal-oriented) interpretation of Marx's theory of alienation because it rendered the [[proletariat]] as the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] of history; an interpretation tainted with the [[Hegelian idealism]] of the "philosophy of the subject", which he criticized as the "bourgeois ideology of philosophy" (see ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' [1923] by [[György Lukács]]).&lt;ref&gt;Alienation.

'''National Life Stories''' is an independent charitable trust and limited company (registered as the ‘National Life Story Collection’) based within the [[British Library]] Oral History section, whose key focus and expertise is [[oral history]] fieldwork.  Since 1987 National Life Stories (NLS) has initiated a series of innovative interviewing projects funded almost entirely from sponsorship, charitable and individual donations.

Each NLS project is archived at the British Library and comprises recorded in-depth interviews, plus content summaries and (if funds allow) transcripts to assist users.  Alongside the British Library’s oral history collections, which stretch back to the beginning of the twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/oralhistory Oral History collections at the British Library]&lt;/ref&gt; NLS recordings form a unique and invaluable record of people’s lives in Britain today.

== History ==
The proposal for NLS was first developed by [[Paul Thompson (oral historian)]] and [[Asa Briggs]] in 1985-6.  The project for a ‘National Life Story Collection’ had a number of distinct features; it was to be a ‘life story’ project intending to collect full autobiographical material including both written autobiographies as well as recorded ‘[[oral history]]’.  And it was intended to 'record first-hand experiences of as wide a cross-section of present-day society as possible'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/nls National Life Stories webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; combining recordings with both elites (who at that time had been largely neglected by British oral historians) and a cross-section of ordinary men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsreports/nlsreport2007.pdf Professor Paul Thompson, ‘Twenty Years of National Life Stories 1987 – 2007’, National Life Stories Review and Accounts 2007/2008 pp18]&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1986 Thompson and Briggs recruited a distinguished body of trustees, including [[Baroness Ewart-Biggs]], [[Penelope Lively]], [[Austin Mitchell]], Sir [[Russell Johnston (politician)|Russell Johnson]] MP, [[Robert Blake, Baron Blake|Robert Blake]], [[Elizabeth Longford]], Professor Peter Laslett, Professor John Saville and [[Jack Jones (trade unionist)]].  Advisors included [[Melvyn Bragg]].  Other important early trustees included the property developer Jack Rose and the first Treasurer, Peter Hands.  With Lord Briggs as Chairman and Paul Thompson as Director, an inaugural meeting of the National Life Story Collection (NLS) as a company was held on 11 November 1986, and registration as a charity was obtained in October 1987. &lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=327571&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 Charity Commission, charity overview for National Life Story Collection, 2017].  Retrieved 7 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial endowment funding for NLS came from Paul Thompson’s gift of a Henry Moore sculpture (Working Model For Draped Seated Woman: Figure On Steps), which was sold in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159576102 Sotheby’s Sold Lot Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as donations from the Wingate Foundation and the Nuffield Foundation.  

NLS gained the early support of Dr Christopher Roads, Director of the [[National Sound Archive]] (1983 - 1992) and in return for archiving interviews, NLS was given a free office in the National Sound Archive (then at Exhibition Road, London), materials and technical support.  The appointment of a Curator in Oral History, whose role would be to work closely with the National Life Story Collection, was made in late 1988 (Dr Rob Perks, who took over from Thompson as NLS Director in 1995). The first projects established (all in 1988) were City Lives, The Living Memory of the Jewish Community and Leaders of National Life.  Artists’ Lives, established in 1990, is the longest running continuous project, with more than 350 interviews.  In 2005 National Life Stories was adopted as a trading name.

== Interviewing Methodology ==
NLS was initially conceived to have two spheres of activity.  One sphere was the creation of a ‘Life Story Archive’ of manuscript autobiographies.   However, the main focus was always to be the creation of a ‘National Biography in Sound’, a collection of recorded and transcribed interviews of two kinds; the first was ‘autobiographical interviews with leading British men and women in all fields - politics, industry, administration, the professions, culture or religion’; and interviews with systematic representatives of ordinary citizens, beginning with a national cross-section of all classes and regions, and then concentrating on particular groups in special need of being recorded.  All NLS projects were to follow the in-depth life story approach, starting with family background and childhood, and moving on to education, work and leisure and the community.   This methodology has continued to be followed for projects, and each NLS interview normally averages 8 to 15 hours in length.

== Oral History Programme ==
'''Early Projects'''&lt;br /&gt;
The first NLS project was Leaders of National Life which began in 1988 and which is still added to occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsgen/general.html Leaders of National Life webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  The project aimed to ‘record autobiographical interviews with leading British men and women covering their life experience as a whole’ with subjects selected from all fields – including politics, industry, administration, the professions, culture or religion – in order to achieve a balance.  The project specifically aimed to collect interviews with those life stories had not been recorded or published.  
&lt;br /&gt;
As well as the Leaders of National Life project, which was funded from NLS’s core funds, NLS sought to undertake ‘Special Collections’ with funding sought from professional associations, industry and other institutions - this is the model which has been used ever since.  One of the first of these projects was City Lives, which also began in 1988.  It was led by Paul Thompson (with particularly important help from Sir [[Nicholas Goodison]]) and later by Cathy Courtney.  City Lives was funded entirely from within the City, mostly from smaller donations, but including an especially important grant from the [[Esmée Fairbairn Foundation]].  This project resulted in a unique collection of nearly 150 in-depth interviews of the financial elite of the City of London.  The project culminated in an exhibition of memorabilia and photographic portraits of City interviewees at the [[Bank of England Museum]], and in the publication of the book City Lives: The Changing Voices of British Finance (Methuen, 1996, {{ISBN|0-413-67890-3}}), edited by Cathy Courtney with an introduction by Paul Thompson. A follow-up project, focusing specifically on [[Barings Bank]] (An Oral History of Barings) began in 2009 in partnership with the Baring Archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/barings/barings.html An Oral History of Barings project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another ‘Special Collection’, also begun in 1988, was The Living Memory of the Jewish Community (which ran until 1999);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsjew/jewish.html The Living Memory of the Jewish Community project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; the project was led by Jennifer Wingate and received donations from [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|Lord Young]] and the Clore Foundation.  Although the original concept was broader, the project quickly focused its aims on the recording of Jewish Holocaust survivors in Britain, which at that time had been neglected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsreports/NLSnewsletter2.pdf ‘The Growth of ‘Living Memory of the Jewish Community’, Jennifer Wingate, NLS Newsletter Issue 2: Summer 1999, pp 5-6]&lt;/ref&gt;  This project (helped with funding secured through Martin Paisner and the Edith and Ferdinand Porjes Charitable Trust) culminated with the publication of an educational pack, Voices of the Holocaust (British Library, 1994) edited by Carrie Supple and Rob Perks; the educational pack later became an online web resource on the British Library website, Voices of the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/voices/holocaust.html Voices of the Holocaust]&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Visual Arts and Crafts'''&lt;br /&gt;
NLS has shown a strong emphasis on recording those involved in the visual arts and in design in general, from architects to theatre designers.  The first project to concentrate on the arts was Artists’ Lives, which began in 1990 with crucial seed money for five initial interviews provided by the [[Henry Moore Foundation]].  The project, which by 2011 had over 300 interviews, is directed by Cathy Courtney and is run in collaboration with Tate.  Artists’ Lives has concentrated on painters (through grants especially from the Linbury Trust, the Elephant Trust, the [[Pilgrim Trust]], the Paul Hamlyn Foundation and the [[Arts Council England]]) and sculptors (with key support from the Henry Moore Foundation).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsart/artistslives.html Artists’ Lives project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  A smaller proportion of interviews have been carried out with ‘art professionals’ (with support from the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]]).  The project had had a number of published outputs including the CDs The Sculptor Speaks: Extracts From Recordings With Post-War British Sculptors and Connecting Lines: Artists Talk About Drawing (which is also available online via the British Library’s website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/nls/drawing Connecting Lines: Artists Talk About Drawing]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the interviews with no access restrictions are available online to those within UK Higher Education via the [[British Library Sounds]] website.  In addition, all of the open interviews, with no access restrictions, are available to researchers at Tate Archive.  Recordings sponsored by the [[Henry Moore Foundation]] are available at the [[Henry Moore Institute]]; recordings sponsored by the [[Fleming Collection]] are available via the [[National Gallery of Scotland]] archive, and those sponsored by the [[Yale Center for British Art]] are available through their archives.  

Architects’ Lives began in 1990 and at 2011 had interviewed more than 100 architects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsarch/architectslives.html Architects’ Lives project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  Crafts Lives began in 1999 and, at 2011 has interviewed over 100 studio crafts practitioners including glass artists, textile artists and furniture makers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlscrafts/crafts.html Crafts Lives project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  Interviews from Architects' Lives and Crafts Lives are available via the [[British Library Sounds]] website.  Other NLS projects concentrating on visual arts and design (but which are no longer in-progress) include An Oral History of British Fashion (2002 – 2007); and An Oral History of British Theatre Design (2005 – 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlstheatre/theatre.html An Oral History of British Theatre Design project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  A project recording the life stories of British Photographers (An Oral History of British Photography) is carried out by the British Library’s Oral History section; some of the interviews with no access restrictions are available online to those within UK Higher Education via the [[British Library Sounds]] website.   

'''Industry and Utilities'''&lt;br /&gt;
NLS has always strived to capture the life stories of those involved in industry.  The original idea was for a project on ‘Industrial Lives’, to collect life story interviews from top industrial management from the 1950s onwards, in both public and private industries.  However, instead of one large project more industry-specific projects emerged.  The first of many projects to focus on British utility companies was Lives in Steel (1991 – 1992), which was funded by the General Division of British Steel through the support of David Grieves.  This project resulted in the recording of 90 interviews by Alan Dein of former and current staff at all levels of the industry from directors to manual workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlssteel/steel.html Lives in Steel project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999 another project focusing on British industry, Lives in the Oil Industry, began, a partnership with the [[University of Aberdeen]], running until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsoil/oil.htm Lives in the Oil Industry project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  The project resulted in an archive of interviews with 177 people involved in all sectors of the industry; a number of [[BBC Radio 4]] Archive Hours have used material from the archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00cd3gs The Archive Hour, Piper Alpha’s Legacy]&lt;/ref&gt;  The most recent project to focus on the British utility industries is An Oral History of the Water Industry, which began in 2009 with sponsorship from Cambridge Water, Northumbria Water, [[Scottish Water]], [[Southern Water]], [[Wessex Water]] and [[Yorkshire Water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/water/water.html An Oral History of the Water project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;br /&gt;
The largest project to focus on one industrial sector was Food: From Source to Salespoint, which ran between 1995 and 2007 and resulted in an archive of over 202 interviews.  The project covered many aspects of the UK food industry, from production through to consumption, and interviewed farmers, butchers, supermarket workers, food technologists and retailers, amongst others.  It received sponsorship from a number of the livery companies as well as UK food manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsfood/food.html  Food: From Source to Salespoint  project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  A supplementary set of recordings with Chefs, generously funded by [[Sir John Craven]], began 2009, and [[Tesco]] funded their own oral history project (but conducted by NLS) between 2003 – 2007 (Tesco: An Oral History&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlstesco/tesco.html Tesco: An Oral History project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;).  An Oral History of the Wine Trade (2003 – 2005), was funded by the [[Vintners' Company]] and the [[Institute of Masters of Wine]], and gathered a further forty interviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlswine/wine.html An Oral History of the Wine Trade project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Businesses and Corporations'''&lt;br /&gt;
National Life Stories has worked in partnership with a number of individual businesses and corporations to collect oral histories with employees from all levels of a corporation.  An Oral History of Barings, a project in partnership with the Baring Archive, includes interviews with employees from all levels of the bank, including messengers, secretaries, and one of the bank’s first female senior executives.  Other corporate-specific projects have been undertaken with the brand consultancy [[Wolff Olins]] (An Oral History of Wolff Olins), the [[Royal Mail Group]] and [[The British Postal Museum &amp; Archive]] (An Oral History of the Post Office&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlspost/postoffice.html An Oral History of the Post Office project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;) and with Tesco (Tesco: An Oral History).

'''Writing and Publishing'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Penelope Lively and Sarah O'Reilly Gaisberg Studio BLCC.jpg|thumb|upright| Sarah O'Reilly (interviewer for Authors’ Lives) and Penelope Lively (interviewed for Authors’ Lives and Trustee of NLS) in the British Library interview studio.]] --&gt;
Book Trade Lives, which was led by [[Martyn Goff]] and which received generous funding from the Unwin Foundation, ran between 1997 and 2006.   The project interviewed nearly 120 of those involved in bookselling from the 1920s through the twentieth century, including secretaries, sales managers, editors and publishers' representatives, and specialists in production and design. A CD featuring extracts from the project entitled Book Trade Lives was published by The British Library in 2002 and over 80 interviews from Book Trade Lives were used in The British Book Trade: An Oral History (British Library, 2008 and 2010), edited by the project interviewer Sue Bradley.   A complimentary project, Authors’ Lives began in 2007, and includes life story interviews with novelists, poets, biographers, historians and children’s writers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsauthor/authorslives.html Authors’ Lives project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Writing Life: Authors Speak, a CD containing edited extracts from the collection was published in 2011.  An Oral History of British Press&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlspress/press.html An Oral History of the British Press project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; ran between 1994 and 2006, and collected the life stories of key press and newspaper figures. 

'''Science'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2009 NLS received funding from the Arcadia Fund and the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]] for a new project ([[Oral History of British Science]]).  The project has collected over 100 audio interviews, each 8 to 15 hours in length, with scientists, engineers and others linked with science and technology in Britain, as well as shorter on-location video recordings, over two themed strands: Made in Britain and A Changing Planet. In 2013 National Life Stories began a new oral history project entitled 'Inspiring Scientists: Diversity in British Science', in partnership with the [[Royal Society]] Diversity Programme.  Interviewees range from Professors to PhD students and the focus on science is wide, covering academia, big industry and individual entrepreneurship. Many of the interviews recorded for the projects are available in full on [[British Library Sounds]], while the Voices of Science&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/voices-of-science Voices of Science web resource]&lt;/ref&gt; web resource provides curated access to audio and video highlights from the interviews organised by theme, discipline and interviewee.

'''Other Projects'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Fawcett Collection was a project supported by The Women’s Library, which ran between 1990 and 1992, collecting.  Rebecca Abrams’ book, Woman in a Man's World (Methuen, 1993, {{ISBN|0-413-66350-7}}) was based on this collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsfaw/fawcett.html The Fawcett Collection project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pioneers in Charity and Social Welfare (2004 – present) was initiated with funding from the J. Paul Getty Jnr Charitable Trust,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpgettytrust.org.uk/ J Paul Getty Jnr Charitable Trust website]&lt;/ref&gt; and comprises interviews with key (and often unsung) individuals connected to social welfare, social policy and charity work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlscharity/charity.html Pioneers in Charity and Social Welfare project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''A National Cross-Section'''&lt;br /&gt;
The attempt to record a ‘national cross-section’ of life stories of ordinary men and women has been approached in a number of different ways.  The first was through a life story competition.  In 1991 NLS received a pilot grant from the Literature section of the Arts Council of England to develop the National Life Story Awards as an independent written and audio autobiographical competition; additional funding was received from the European Community Year of Older People and [[ITV Telethon]].  The project was especially well-publicised on both radio and television, and the ambitious official launch included [[Lord Soper]], [[Baroness Blackstone]] and [[Glenda Jackson]].   There were nearly 950 entries, of which 710 were written and 217 recorded (fifteen in video); twenty entries reached the final shortlist all of which highlighted a striking range of social background.  The judges for the final round were Asa Briggs, [[Penelope Lively]], Ann Paul, Rob Perks and [[Paul Thompson (oral historian)]], and the awards ceremony at the Barbican in September 1994 was compared by [[Melvyn Bragg]], one of NLS’s long-standing Advisors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohnls/nlsgen/general.html  National Life Story Awards webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A second initiative for a national ‘memory bank’ was first discussed in 1996 and an application was made to the [[Millennium Commission]].  Eventually a joint scheme (1998 – 2000), with the British Library leading with NLS as a partner along with the BBC, resulted in The Century Speaks: Millennium Oral History Project, archived at the British Library as The Millennium Memory Bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/sound/ohist/ohcoll/ohmaj/majorprojects.html The Millennium Memory Bank project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Naum Veqilharxhi''', born '''Naum Bredhi''' (1797–1846),&lt;ref name="Islami134"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych20"/&gt; was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] lawyer and scholar. In 1844, he created a unique alphabet for the [[Albanian language]] using characters he had created himself, the [[Vithkuqi alphabet|Vithkuqi script]]. Veqilharxhi is one of the most prominent figures of the early [[Albanian National Awakening]], and is considered by Albanians as its first [[ideologue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.pashtriku.org/?kat=47&amp;shkrimi=999|language=Albanian|author=Enis Sulstarova|publisher=Pashtriku|accessdate=2014-12-01|title=Naum Veqilharxhi dhe lindja e kombit|trans-title=Naum Veqilharxhi and the birth of the nation| quote=Naum Veqilharxhi is considered the avant-garde and first ideologue of the National Awakening, because his work results in one of the first attempts for an original Albanian alphabet (1844 and 1845), as well as contains an embryo form of the ideas which would develop later on during the National Renaissance.

==Life==
===Early life===
Naum Veqilharxhi was born Naum Bredhi in 1797 in the village of [[Vithkuq]], near [[Korçë]], southern [[Albania]]. His father, Panajot Bredhi, was a [[Steward (office)|steward]] of [[Ali Pashë Tepelena]], the ruler of the [[Pashalik of Janina]]. After the destruction of [[Vithkuq]] in 1819, he sought a better life in [[Romania]].&lt;ref name="Elsie"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|year=2010|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|publisher=Scarecrow Press, inc.: Plymouth, United Kingdom|pages=469–470|quote=" Nationalist figure. Naum Veqilharxhi was one of the earliest men to devote himself to the creation of a new Albanian alphabet and also one of the first to formulate the ideals and objectives of the Albanian nationalist movement in its budding stages. He was born of a family from the village of Bredh near Vithkuq in the Korça region. It was no doubt after the destruction of Vithkuq in 1819 that Veqilharxhi immigrated to Romania in search of a better life. In 1821, he took part in a Wallachian uprising against the Turks. He spent the rest of his life as a lawyer, as far as is known, in the port of Brăila on the Danube. He died of poisoning in Istanbul, allegedly at the hands of Greek Orthodox fanatics supposedly linked to the patriarch of Constantinople. Whether this is true or not will never be known. However, it is known that the patriarchate was at odds with all expressions of non-Greek nationalism in the Balkans. In a letter in Greek, which Naum Veqilharxhi is reported to have circulated, he pointed to the backwardness and misery of the Albanians as a result of long centuries of Turkish rule and stressed the need for a new Albanian alphabet as a means of overcoming this stagnation and of uniting the country. In 1824 or 1825, Veqilharxhi had already begun working on the 33-letter alphabet of his own invention, which he had printed in an eight-page Albanian spelling book in 1844. This little spelling book was distributed throughout southern Albania, from Korça to Berat, and was received, it appears, with a good deal of enthusiasm. The booklet was augmented to 48 pages in a second edition in 1845 entitled Faré i ri abétor shqip per djélm nismetore (A Very New Albanian Spelling Book for Elementary Schoolboys)... Veqilharxhi stands out as the first man of letters in the 19th century to have expressed the ideals of the growing Albanian nationalist movement."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi121145"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|pp=121, 145.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student he took part in the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]].&lt;ref name="Gawrych20"/&gt; A few years later he worked in [[Brăila]] as a lawyer, became wealthy and used his money to promote the ideas of the [[Albanian National Awakening]].&lt;ref name="treptow"&gt;{{cite book|last=Treptow|first=Kurt|title=From Zalmoxis to Jan Palach: studies in East European history|url=https://books.google.com/?id=slVpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Naum+Veqilharxhi&amp;dq=Naum+Veqilharxhi|series=East European monographs|volume=328|year=1992|publisher=East European Monographs|isbn=0-88033-225-5|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brăila he joined an intellectual organization of Albanians, who considered the development of Albanian language and culture necessary for the Albanian National Awakening.&lt;ref name="treptow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi121"/&gt;

===Activism and works===
In 1824 or 1825&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt; he started the creation of his alphabet of the Albanian language.&lt;ref name="Skendi139"/&gt; The final version of his thirty-three-letter [[Vithkuqi alphabet]], whose characters were invented by Veqilharxhi, was printed as part of primer in 1844-5 titled ''Evëtori Shqip Fort i Shkurtër'' ({{lang-en|The most Useful and Concise Albanian Alphabet}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris|first=H.T|title=Islam in the Balkans: religion and society between Europe and the Arab world|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RGmzir-ITtUC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;dq=Naum+Bredhi#v=onepage&amp;q=Naum%20Bredhi&amp;f=false|year=1993|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|isbn=0-87249-977-4|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi139"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych20"/&gt; Veqilharxhi avoided the use of Latin, Greek or Arabic alphabets and characters because of their religious associations and the possibility of causing divisions among Albanians of different religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Straehle|first=Carolin|title=International journal of the sociology of language|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fvhhAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Naum+Veqilharxhi&amp;dq=Naum+Veqilharxhi|year=1974|publisher=Mouton|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi139"/&gt; Veqilarxhi's ''Evëtor'' first distributed in Korçë and later westwards as far as [[Berat]], where it reached great success.&lt;ref name="michelson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Michelson|first=Paul|title=National development in Romania and southeastern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8OCgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Athanase+Pascali&amp;dq=Athanase+Pascali|year=2002|publisher=Center for Romanian Studies|isbn=973-9432-37-9|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi139"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skendi|first=Stavro|title=The Albanian national awakening|year=1967|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8QPWCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=The+Albanian+National+Awakening&amp;ots=zGjQbVyql8&amp;sig=xsmbL-yAAtc-ny3v0E4vN87JOBY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=Naum%20Veqilharxhi&amp;f=false|isbn=9781400847761|pages=139.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych20"/&gt; It was also circulated in Përmet.&lt;ref&gt;Pahumi, Nevila.

Page 25: "Berat, Korça and Përmet"&lt;/ref&gt; On April 22, 1845 Athanas Paskali, one of the notable people of Korçë, along with others sent him a letter requesting as many more copies as possible.&lt;ref name="michelson"/&gt; Among Albanian historians this publication by Veqilharxhi is considered as the beginning of the Albanian national awakening.&lt;ref name="Gawrych20"/&gt;

In 1845 Veqilharxhi sent a polemic open letter written in the Greek language to his nephew, who had called his patriotic ideas ''chimera'': the letter is considered to be one of the first written documents to record the main ideas of the Albanian National Awakening movement.&lt;ref name="Islami137"&gt;Islami, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; His death is thought{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to have been from poisoning by orders from the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=Palairet114115&gt;{{cite book|last=Palairet|first=Michael|title=Macedonia: A Voyage through History (Vol. 2, From the Fifteenth Century to the Present)|year=2016|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nyb5DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;dq=Kor%C3%A7%C3%AB+Vlachs+Greeks&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Kor%C3%A7%C3%AB%20Vlachs%20Greeks&amp;f=false|isbn=9781443888493|pages=114–115|quote=A pioneering effort by one Vekilcharje in about 1850 produced an Albanian alphabet, in which a few small books were printed.

==Ideas==
Outside of his native land Veqilharxhi in Romania was a figure that thrived within the security of the Albanian diaspora where both worlds became linked together, a dynamic that led thereafter to the development of [[Albanianism]] by other Albanians.&lt;ref name="Gawrych20"/&gt;

Veqilharxhi lamented the "backwardness" of his homeland and attributed it to centuries of Ottoman rule, and argued that a new unifying Albanian alphabet was necessary to overcome the stagnation and unify the country.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt; He was concerned by the lack of Albanian schools, and saw the development of written Albanian as a necessary precursor to cultural and political development.&lt;ref&gt;Pahumi, Nevila. "Consolidation of Albanian nationalism". Page 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhelyaz"/&gt; Veqilharxhi felt that education in one's mother tongue was important toward acquiring knowledge and "culture".&lt;ref name="Skendi121"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=121.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych20"/&gt; In one preface written to Albanian schoolboys, he berates Albanian children who did "not know their own heritage; not only are they unable to write in their own language, they cannot even pray to the Lord in the language each of them tasted with his mother’s milk", and for learning only the languages of foreignors and not their own. He urged Albanian boys to study their own language in order to "join the civilized world, prove that our land is idle no longer and show ourselves as men of great honor",&lt;ref&gt;Pahumi, Nevila (2007). "Consolidation of Albanian Nationalism". University of Michigan. Pages 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; and compared the Albanian nation to a "larva" that may one day become a butterfly.&lt;ref name=Misha/&gt;

It has been argued that, in his formative earlier years, Veqilharxhi was influenced by [[Greek nationalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Pahumi, Nevila (2007). "Consolidation of Albanian nationalism". University of Michigan. Page 25: "It is safe to assume that Veqilharxhi had probably been influenced by nationalist ideas during the Greek Revolution in which he took part.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a member of the [[Filiki Eteria]].&lt;ref&gt;Islami, Myslim. ''Naum Veqilharxhi: Ideologu i Pare i Rilindjes Shqiptar''. Pages 133-137&lt;/ref&gt; In 1821, he took part in the [[Romania]]n uprising in Wallachia during his stay there.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gawrych20"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gawrych|first=George|title=The Crescent and the Eagle: Ottoman rule, Islam and the Albanians, 1874–1913|year=2006|location=London|publisher=IB Tauris|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wPOtzk-unJgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+crescent+and+the+eagle:+Ottoman+rule,+Islam+and+the+Albanians,+1874-1913+lexicon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiT94zl8ebXAhWJT7wKHYRLADEQ6AEIJjAA#v=snippet&amp;q=Veqilharxhi&amp;f=false|isbn=9781845112875|pages=20.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, he warned that "Greek schools are organized to illuminate Greek youth and not to illuminate the Albanian people", and felt that native language education was necessary to prevent [[Hellenisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Meksi, Fedhon. "Veqilharxhi, babai i alfabetit dhe abetares shqiptare". 21 October 2011. "N. Veqilharxhi e kishte të qartë se “shkollat greke janë të organizuara për të ndriçuar rininë greke dhe jo për ndriçimin e popullit shqiptar” (Letra dërguar Jani Calit, 1846). Në këto kushte Naum Veqilharxhi ishte i pari që ndjeu nevojën e ngutshme të përhapjes së arsimit në gjuhën amtare për të penguar helenizimin e vendit."&lt;/ref&gt;

Veqilharxhi is considered to be the first written ideologue of [[Albanian nationalism]]&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhelyaz"&gt;Zhelyazkova, Antonina. "Albanian Identities". International Centre for Minority Studies and Intercultural Relations (IMIR): Sofia. Page 24:"It is assumed that the beginning of the Albanian Revival was set by Naum Veqilharxhi's activity and his address to the Orthodox Albanians, which, along with his primer published in 1845, was the first programme document of the Albanian national movement.

"Përveçse ideologu i parë, Naum Veqilharxhi vlerësohet edhe si iluministi i parë i Rilindjes Kombëtare Shqiptare."&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to his Evëtor was a primer addressed to Orthodox Albanians, which became the first programme document of the Albanian national movement.&lt;ref name="Zhelyaz"/&gt;

Veqilharxhi conceived of Albania as a nation with its own language, customs and history, and its own territory.&lt;ref&gt;Pahumi, Nevila. "Consolidation of Albanian Nationalism". University of Michigan. Page 25: "Part of Veqilharxhi’s grander vision saw an Albanian nation, with its own language, customs and history, as well as territory."&lt;/ref&gt; His conception of Albania included a harmony between the different faiths practiced by Albanians, with each faith being practiced by Albanians a little bit differently than it would be by non-Albanians, which would evolve into the Albanian national ideal of religious harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Meksi, Fedhon. "Veqilharxhi, babai I alfabetit edhe abetares shqiptare". 21 October 2011. Panorama. "N. Veqilharxhi kishte ideuar rikonstruksionin e kombit shqiptar që përfshinte myslimanët dhe të krishterët, vërtetuar tashmë nga historia, dhe si aliazh që është, doli më i fortë dhe më rezistent sesa elementët që e përbëjnë. Dora-dorës, populli shqiptar e pranoi porosinë e Naumit dhe krijoi modelin e tij, sipas të cilit besimet fetare do të praktikoheshin në një mënyrë të veçantë, në mënyrën shqiptare, me tone të ulura, jo vetëm pa ngacmuar bashkëkombësit e feve të tjera, po gjithmonë duke i respektuar ato. Kjo është harmonia fetare ose bashkëjetesa shqiptare që ideoi N. Veqilharxhi dhe që sot, falë urtësisë të popullit tonë, përbën një vlerë të veçantë të tij, si një model referimi për popujt e tjerë ballkanikë, si mënyrën e vetme për një të ardhme të përbashkët më të lumtur."&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped Albanian nationalism take its ultimate course of using language, rather than religion as other Balkan nationalisms did, as its primary unifier.&lt;ref&gt;Meksi, Fedhon. "Veqilharxhi, babai i alfabetit dhe abetares shqiptare". 21 October 2011. " Naum Veqilharxhi përcaktoi drejtimin kryesor të nacionalizmit shqiptar, që do të kishte specifikën e tij. Ai do të përpunohej duke u mbështetur kryesisht mbi gjuhën amtare dhe jo mbi fenë, si në rastin e nacionalizmave të tjerë ballkanikë."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hindu scriptures}}
'''Nirukta''' ({{lang-sa|निरुक्त}}, {{IPA-sa|n̪irukt̪ə|IPA}}) means "explained, interpreted" and refers to one of the six ancient [[Vedanga]]s, or ancillary science connected with the [[Vedas]] – the scriptures of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnirukta&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA494|year=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=vi, 494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca476&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Nirukta" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, page 476&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=105}} Nirukta covers [[etymology]], and is the study concerned with correct interpretation of Sanskrit words in the Vedas.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=105}} 

''Nirukta'' is the systematic creation of a glossary and it discusses how to understand archaic, uncommon words.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnirukta/&gt; The field grew probably because almost a quarter of words in the Vedic texts composed in the 2nd-millennium BCE appear just once.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca476/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. S. Apte, ''A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary'', p. 556.  Apte gives a ''nirukta sūtra'' for the word ''nirukta'' itself using a traditional definition as नाम च धातुजमाह निरुत्कं or "Name and root origins are ''nirukta''".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monier-Williams. ''A Sanskrit-English Dictionary''. p. 553.&lt;br&gt;Macdonell, Arthur Anthony. ''A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary''. p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of ''Nirukta'' can be traced to the last centuries of the 2nd-millennium BCE [[Brahmana]]s layer of the Vedic texts.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=105}} However, the most ancient complete surviving text of this field is a commentary on ''Nighantu'' by [[Yaska|{{IAST|Yāska}}]], who probably lived about the 7th century BCE.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=107}} His text is also referred simply as ''Nirukta''.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca476/&gt;{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=107}} The study of ''Nirukta'' has been closely related to the ancillary Vedic science of ''[[Vyakarana]]'', but they have a different focus. ''Vyakarana'' deals with linguistic analysis to establish the exact form of words to properly express ideas, while Nirukta focuses on linguistic analysis to help establish the proper meaning of the words, given the context they are used in.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=105}} [[Yaska]] asserts that the prerequisite to the study of ''Nirukta'' is the study of ''Vyakarana''.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=105}}{{Sfn|Maurice Winternitz|1963|p=460}}

The texts of the ''Nirukta'' field of study are also called '''Nirvacana shastra'''.{{Sfn|Eivind Kahrs|1998|p=13}} A critical edition of the Nighantu and the Nirukta was published by Lakshman Sarup in the 1920s.

==Etymology==
Nirukta (Sanskrit), states Monier-Williams, means "uttered, pronounced, explained, expressed, defined, loud".&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnirukta/&gt; It also refers to the etymological interpretation of a word, also the name of such works.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnirukta/&gt;

The related Sanskrit noun ''{{IAST|niruktiḥ}}'' means "poetical derivation" or "explanation of a word."&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnirukta/&gt;

==Discussion==
The field of ''Nirukta'' deals with ascertaining the meaning of words, particularly of archaic words no longer in use, ones created long ago and even then rarely used.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca476/&gt; The Vedic literature from the 2nd millennium BCE has a very large collection of such words, with nearly 25% of the words therein being used just once.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca476/&gt; By the 1st millennium BCE, interpreting and understanding what the Vedas meant had become a challenge, and ''Nirukta'' attempted to systematically propose theories on how words form, and then determine their meaning in order to understand the Vedas.&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca476/&gt;{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|pp=105-110}}

Yaska, the sage who likely lived around the 7th-century BCE, approached this problem through a semantic analysis of words, by breaking them down into their components, and then combined them in the context they were used to propose what the archaic words could have meant.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=4}}

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 6px #FFE0BB;padding:1.0em"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'''Don't memorize, seek the meaning'''&lt;br&gt;What has been taken [from the teacher's mouth] but not understood,&lt;br&gt;is uttered by mere [memory] recitation,&lt;br&gt;it never flares up, like dry firewood without fire.&lt;br&gt;Many a one, [although] seeing, do not see Speech,&lt;br&gt;many a one, [although] hearing, do not hear Her,&lt;br&gt; and many a one, She spreads out [Her] body, like a wife desiring her husband.&lt;br&gt;The meaning of Speech, is its fruit and flower.&lt;/p&gt;
— Yaska, ''Nirukta 1.18-1.20''{{Sfn|Eivind Kahrs|1998|pp=46-47}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ram Gopal|title=The History and Principles of Vedic Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=evY93w240isC|year=1983|publisher=Concept|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A central premise of Yaska was that man creates more new words to conceptualize and describe action, that is nouns often have verbal roots.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=4}} However, added Yaska, not all words have verbal roots. He asserted that both the meaning and the etymology of words are always context dependent.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=107}} Words are created around object-agent, according to Yaska, to express external or internal reality perceived by man, and are one of six modifications of ''Kriya'' (action) and ''Bhava'' (dynamic being), namely being born, existing, changing, increasing, decreasing and perishing.{{Sfn|Tibor Kiss|2015|pp=87-90}}{{Sfn|Annette Wilke|Oliver Moebus|2011|pp=416-419}}

A sentence is a collection of words, a word is a collection of phonemes, according to Nirukta scholars of Hindu traditions.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=106}} The meaning of Vedic passages has to be understood through context, purpose stated, subject matter being discussed, what is stated, how, where and when.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=106}}

==Texts==
The only basic ''Nirvacana shastra'' (Nirukta-related text) that has survived from ancient times into the modern era is the one by Yaska, and it is simply called ''Nirukta''.{{Sfn|Eivind Kahrs|1998|p=13}} Three [[bhasya]] (commentaries) on Yaska's ''Nirukta'' have also survived.{{Sfn|Eivind Kahrs|1998|p=13}} Additionally, a related work that is extant and is more ancient than the 7th-century BCE ''Nirukta'' by Yaska, is the ''Nighantu'' which is a lexicographic treatise.{{Sfn|Eivind Kahrs|1998|p=13}} The ''Nighantu'' is a glossary or compilation of words in the Vedas, and is an example text of ''Abhidhanashastra'' (literally, science of words).&lt;ref name="Gonda1979p303"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claus Vogel|editor=Jan Gonda|title=Indian lexicography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKziSs8Qy44C |year=1979 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-02010-7|pages=303–306 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Nighantu'' is not a dictionary, a genre of texts that developed in later centuries and was called a ''Kosha'' in Sanskrit.&lt;ref name="Gonda1979p303"/&gt; Yaska's ''Nirukta'' extensively refers to the ''Nighantu''.{{Sfn|Eivind Kahrs|1998|p=13}}&lt;ref name="Gonda1979p303"/&gt;

The three commentaries on Yaska's ''Nirukta'' text are by Hindu scholars named Durgasinha (also known as Durga) who likely lived before the 6th-century CE,{{Sfn|Eivind Kahrs|1998|p=14}} Skanda-Mahesvara who may be two scholars who probably lived before the 5th-century CE,{{Sfn|Eivind Kahrs|1998|pp=14-20}} and Nilakantha who probably is from the 14th-century.{{Sfn|Eivind Kahrs|1998|p=22}}

==Usage==
===Ancient===
Yaska, in his famous text titled ''Nirukta'', asserts that [[Rigveda]] in the ancient tradition, can be interpreted in three ways - from the perspective of religious rites (''adhiyajna''), from the perspective of the deities (''adhidevata''), and from the perspective of the soul (''adhyatman'').{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=106}} The fourth way to interpret the Rigveda also emerged in the ancient times, wherein the gods mentioned were viewed as symbolism for legendary individuals or narratives.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=106}} It was generally accepted that creative poets often embed and express double meanings, ellipses and novel ideas to inspire the reader.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|p=106}} ''Nirukta'' enables one to identify alternate embedded meanings that poets and writers may have included in old texts.{{Sfn|Harold G. Coward|1990|pp=105-110}}

===Medieval===
{{refimprove-section|date=March 2016}}
Many examples of the rhetorical use of nirukta occur in [[Bhaskararaya]]'s commentaries.  Here is an example from the opening verse of his commentary on the [[Ganesha Sahasranama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Gaṇeśasahasranāmastotram: mūla evaṁ srībhāskararāyakṛta ‘khadyota’ vārtika sahita}}.  ({{IAST|Prācya Prakāśana: Vārāṇasī}}, 1991).  Includes the full source text and the commentary by Bhāskararāya in Sanskrit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening verse includes ''{{IAST|Gaṇanātha}}'' as a name for [[Ganesha]].  The simple meaning of this name, which would have seemed obvious to his readers, would be "Protector of the Ganas", parsing the name in a straightforward way as ''{{IAST|gaṇa}}'' (group) + ''nātha'' (protector).  But Bhaskararaya demonstrates his skill in nirukta by parsing it in an unexpected way as the [[bahuvrihi|Bahuvrīhi]] compound ''{{IAST|gaṇana}}'' + ''atha'' meaning "the one the enumeration ({{IAST|gaṇanaṁ}}) of whose qualities brings about auspiciousness. The word ''atha'' is associated with auspiciousness ({{IAST|maṅgalam}})." &lt;ref&gt;गणनं गुणसंख्यानामथशब्दात्तु मङ्गलम् । कृते तयोर्बहुव्रीहौ गणनाथ इति स्मृतः ॥ ५ ॥&lt;/ref&gt;  This rhetorical flourish at the opening of the [[sahasranama]] demonstrates Bhaskaraya's skills in nirukta at the very beginning of his commentary on a thousand such names, including a clever twist appropriate to the context of a sahasranama.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23749">A '''parish register''' in an [[ecclesiastical parish]] is a handwritten volume, normally kept in the [[parish church]] in which certain details of religious ceremonies marking major events such as [[baptism]]s (together with the dates and names of the parents), marriages (with the names of the partners), children, and burials (that had taken place within the parish) are recorded. Along with these vital details, church goods, the parish’s response to briefs, and notes on various happenings in the parish were also recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of the English Parish: The Culture of Religion from Augustine to Victoria|last = Pounds|first = N.J.G.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 288}}&lt;/ref&gt; These elaborate records existed for the purpose of preventing bigamy and consanguineous marriage. 

The information recorded in registers was also considered significant for secular governments’ own recordkeeping, resulting in the churches supplying the state with copies of all parish registers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The People of New France|last = Greer|first = Allan|publisher = |year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A good register permits the family structure of the community to be reconstituted as far back as the sixteenth century. Thus, these records were distilled for the definitive study of the history of several nations’ populations. They also provide insight into the lives and interrelationships of [[parish]]ioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of the English Parish: The Culture of Religion from Augustine to Victoria|last = Pounds|first = N.J.G.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==
=== England ===
Parish registers were formally introduced in England on 5 September 1538 following the split with [[Rome]], when [[Thomas Cromwell]], minister to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], issued an injunction requiring the registers of baptisms, marriages and burials to be kept. Before this, a few [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religious’ houses and parish priests had kept informal notes on the baptisms, marriages and burials of the prominent local families. This injunction was addressed to the rector or vicar of every parish in England. However, this order had nothing to do with religious doctrine or the papacy and rather indicated the desire of the central government to have full knowledge of the population of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of the English Parish: The Culture of Religion from Augustine to Victoria|last = Pound|first = N.J.G.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was to be kept in a "sure coffer" with two locks and keys. A fine of 3 sols, 4 deniers was to be levied for failure to comply. Many parishes ignored this order as it was commonly thought that it presaged a further tax.

Finally, in 1597, both Queen and Convocation reaffirmed the injunction, adding that the registers were of ''‘permagnus usus’'' and must be kept in books of parchment leaves. Previous records (most found in a less durable form) had to be copied into the new books and copies of each year’s entries had to be sent to the bishop’s registrar. The parish clerk was paid to copy the old records into a new parchment book in order to keep the record up to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of the English Parish: The Culture of Religion from Augustine to Victoria|last = Pounds|first = N.J.G.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the English Civil War (1643–1647) and in the following Commonwealth period, records were poorly kept and many are now missing after being destroyed (bored by beetles, chewed by rats or rendered illegible by damp) or hidden by the clergy. This parsimony and neglect was remedied by depositing the registers in county record offices where they were safeguarded and made accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of the English Parish: The Culture of Religion from Augustine to Victoria|last = Pounds|first = N.J.G.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 290}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, the accurate parish registers of New France were rarely damaged by external events such as war, revolution, and fire. Thus, 300,00 entries were available for the time period 1621 to 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The People of New France|last = Greer|first = Allan|publisher = |year = 1997|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812 England, an "Act for the better regulating and preserving Parish and other Registers of Birth, Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials, in England" was passed It stated that "amending the Manner and Form of keeping and of preserving Registers of Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials of His Majesty's Subjects in the several Parishes and Places in England, will greatly facilitate the Proof of Pedigrees of Persons claiming to be entitled to Real or Personal Estates, and otherwise of great public Benefit and Advantage". Separate, printed registers were to be supplied by the King's Printer, and used for baptisms, marriages and burials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Ecclesiastical Statutes at Large, extr. and Arranged by J.T.

=== United States ===
In the United States, at least the parishes in the Roman Catholic dioceses maintained a similar practice of recording baptisms, marriages, burials, and often also confirmations and first communions. From the earliest pioneer churches ministered by itinerant priests, the records were written in ecclesiastical Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Parochial Registers}}&lt;/ref&gt; But after the [[Second Vatican Council]] and its reforms that included translating the Mass into local languages, most register entries gradually came to be written in English. In Protestant communions with stronger similarities to Roman Catholicism, parish registers are also important sources that document baptisms, marriages, and funerals. In Protestant and Evangelical churches, individual ministers often kept records of faith-related events among the congregation, but under much less guidance from any central governing body.

=== Italy ===
The parish register became mandatory in Italy for baptisms and marriages in 1563 after the [[Council of Trent]] and in 1614 for burials when its rules of compilation were as well normalised by the Church. Prior to 1563, the oldest registers of baptisms are preserved since 1379 in [[Gemona del Friuli]], 1381 in [[Siena]], 1428 in [[Florence]] or 1459 in [[Bologna]].

=== France ===
In France, parish registers have been in use since the Middle Ages. The oldest surviving registers date back to 1303 and are posted in [[Givry, Saône-et-Loire|Givry]]. Other existing registers prior to orders of civil legislation in 1539 reside in  [[Roz-Landrieux]] 1451, [[Paramé]] 1453, [[Lanloup]] 1467, [[Trans-la-Forêt]] 1479 and [[Signes, Var|Signes]] 1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Le Premier Registre de Baptemes de France: Roz-Landrieux (1451)|last = Isbled|first = Bruno|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parish register became mandatory in France for baptisms with the [[Ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts]] signed into law by [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] of France on August 10, 1539, then for marriages and burials with the Ordinance of Blois in 1579. They had to be sent every year to the [[bailiwick]] or ''sénéchaussée'' in the south of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Histoires de familles: les registres paroissiaux et d'état civil, du Moyen Âge à nos jours : démographie et généalogie.|last = Delsalle|first = Paul|publisher = Presses universitaires de Franche-Comté.|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Besançon|pages = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1667, the Ordinance of Saint-Germain-en-Laye ordered a copy to be kept by the parish clergy as before the ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = History of Civil Registration in Quebec|last = Parrot|first = Paul|date = 1930|journal = Canadian Public Health Journal |volume=21 |issue=11|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; By decree of the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] of September 20, 1792, the keeping of the civil registers was given to mayors and the old parish registers went then to the public records of the ''archives communales,'' and the old bailiwick registers to the ''archives departementales'' created in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = History of Civil Registration in Quebec|last = Parrot|first = Paul|date = 1930|journal = Canadian Public Health Journal |volume=21 |issue=11|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; But from 1795, the parish again kept some private registers, like the ''registres de catholicité'' for the Catholic Church which are also made in duplicate, one for the parish and one for the diocesan archives. The legalization of these documents, functioning both as a means of census as well as civil documentation, has in some cases been used to restore official acts of civil status such as after the downfall of the Paris commune and the reconstruction of  Le Palais de Justice after the fires of 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = L'année Terrible|last = Milza|first = Pierre|publisher = Perrin|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = 401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New France ===
The first Europeans to settle in North America continued the practice of establishing parish registers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/vital-statistics-births-marriages-deaths/Pages/parish-registers.aspx|title = Parish Registers|date = |access-date = |website = Library and Archives Canada|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the establishment of [[Habitation de Québec|Habitation]], the arrival of [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit priests]] in 1615 facilitated the earliest beginnings of the parish register in [[New France]].These earliest accounts entered into the register were recorded primarily within the Jesuits personal logs, and accounted exclusively for the number of deaths in the early settlement period of Quebec.However, over time the growing French population propagated the development and detailing of the parish register. Entries detailing births, marriages, baptisms and deaths were recorded and kept in the church of [[Notre Dame-de-la-Recouvrance]]. Unfortunately, in 1640 the church burned along with all parish records from 1620 to 1640. After the church burned, the [[parish priest]] commissioned at Notre Dame-de-la- Recouverance reconstructed the destroyed register entries from memory by recording the rather limited number of births, baptisms and marriages to take place within the colony during this 20-year period. Deaths however, were not recorded in the reconstructed registers and as a consequence there is no recorded account of the death of [[Samuel de Champlain]] who died in 1635.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = History of Civil Registration in Quebec". Canadian Public Health Journal 21 (11)|last = Parrot|first = Paul|date = 1930|journal = Canadian Public Health Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the creating and maintaining parish registers in Europe had been in practice since the Middle Ages, legislation regarding the widespread and legal use of parish registers in France was officially passed into law with the signing of the Ordnance of Villers-Cotterets in 1539.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Histoires de familles, les registres paroissiaux et d'état civil, du Moyen Âge à nos jours, démographie et généalogie|last = Delsalle|first = Paul|publisher = Presses universitaires de Franche-Comté|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Besançon|pages = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until 1666 where after perceiving the immense advantages to be gained through civil registration that [[King Louis XIV]] revitalized the parish registration system in France and her colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = History of Civil Registration in Quebec|last = Parrot|first = Paul|date = 1930|journal = Canadian Public Health Journal |volume=21 |issue=11|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This edict, set forth by the king, made it compulsory for individuals to register within their parish communities. Moreover, in 1667 the king revealed the Ordonnance de Saint Germain en Laye, a piece of legislation which required parish priests to produce a duplicate of all registers so that all copies may be stored in emerging records offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Histoires de familles, les registres paroissiaux et d'état civil, du Moyen Âge à nos jours, démographie et généalogie|last = Delsalle|first = Paul|publisher = Presses universitaires de Franche-Comté|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Besançon|pages = 38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New France, these duplicates were stored in [[Quebec City|Quebec]] and [[Montreal]]’s Courts of Justice official records office and listed [[New France]]’s Roman Catholic population exclusively. It was only until after cession and the British conquest of New France in 1760 that parish registers began to more openly include Protestants within the registry, and as civil subjects of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = History of Civil Registration in Quebec|last = Parrot|first = Paul|date = 1930|journal = Canadian Public Health Journal |volume=21 |issue=11|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
Parish registers have been kept for each [[parish]] by the [[Church of Sweden]] for some Swedish counties (Västmanland and Dalarna) since the 1620s, and generally for the whole Sweden since the 1670s. The church was ordered to keep even more detailed church books in king [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI's]] Church Law from 1686.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Johnsson, [https://anforskning.wordpress.com/2015/04/22/att-slaktforska-om-1900-talet/ A guide to Swedish 20s century genealogy], 22 April 2015 (in Swedish, open content)&lt;/ref&gt; The primary motivation was to keep track of the number of soldiers that were taken out from each parish, and that were financed by each parish, through the [[allotment system]] that was introduced in 1682. Another motivation was to keep track of religious knowledge, literacy and health among the population. The church books constitute of birth, death, marriage and moving in/out records, all of which were linked to the parish catechetical book, which was replaced in 1895 by the parish book. In country side parishes, each village or industrial town had its own section in the catechetical book, each farmyard its own page, and each person its own row. For city parishes, the book was divided into districts. The majority of church records are still preserved in the state archives, and available electronically over the Internet.

==Contents and examples from England==
The contents have changed over time, not being standardised in England until the Acts of 1753 and 1812. The following are among what you can expect to find in later registers, though in the earlier ones it is quite common to find only names recorded. Early entries will be in some form of Latin, often abbreviated.

===Baptisms===
*Date of baptism
*Date of birth (but this is often not recorded)
*Child's forename 
*Child's surname (though normally omitted as father's name is assumed)
*Father's name — blank if illegitimate 
*Mother's name (but this is often not recorded)
*Father's occupation or rank
*Place of birth (for large parishes)
*Examples:
#Baptised 21 August 1632 William son of Francis Knaggs
#Baptism 5 January 1783 Richard son of Thomas Knaggs, farmer, and his wife Mary, born 6 December 1782

===Marriages===
*Date of marriage
*For both man and woman
**Forename and Surname
**Whether bachelor or spinster, widower or widow
**Age
**Whether of-this-parish or of some other place
**Occupation (normally man only)
**Father's forename, surname and occupation or rank
**Signature
*Whether by Banns or by Licence
*Witness(es) signature(s)
*Note: from 1837, the information contained in parish records is the same as that on a civil marriage certificate.
*Examples:
#Married 2 May 1635 Francis Ducke and Anne Knaggs
#Married 16 May 1643 Leonard Huntroids yeoman of Brafferton and Lucy Knaggs widow of this parish
#[1643 Marriages] Alexander Mackree et Anna Hancocke undecimo die men(sis) Julii nupti fuerent Annoq(ue) predicto
#Married 11 August 1836 Richard Knaggs the younger, age 20, bachelor, farmer of Kilham and Elizabeth Wilson, age 25, spinster of this parish, by licence and with the consent of those whose consent is required

===Burials===
*Date of burial
*Name of deceased
*Age of deceased
*Occupation, rank or relationship of deceased
*Normal place of abode of deceased
*Examples:
#Buried 6 January 1620 Richard Knags
#Buried 4 November 1653 stillborn daughter of Raiph Knaggs of Ugthorpe
#Buried 25th Dec 1723 Mr George Knaggs, gent of Pollington, aged 74
#Buried 19 July 1762 Thomas Knaggs, son of Thomas tailor of Byers Green and Elizabeth, age 13, drowned, double fees

===Dade and Barrington Registers===
Dade and Barrington Registers are detailed registers that contain more information than standard contemporary baptism and burial registers. They usually commence in the late eighteenth century, but come to an end in 1812, when they were superseded by the requirements of George Rose’s 1812 Act, which required more information to be recorded than in normal registers, but actually required less information to be recorded than in Dade and Barrington Registers. There are examples of a few parishes continuing to keep Dade or Barrington Registers after 1813. In some cases, two registers were kept, for example in the Co Durham parish of [[Whickham]] both Barrington and Rose Registers were kept for the period 1813-1819, after which the former were discontinued.

[[William Dade]], a Yorkshire clergyman of the 18th century, was ahead of his time, in seeing the value of including as much information on individuals in the parish register as possible. In 1777 [[William Markham (archbishop)|Archbishop William Markham]] decided that Dade's scheme of registration forms should be introduced throughout his diocese. The resulting registers, and some that are related, are now known as "Dade registers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=6998|title=Dade, William|first=William Joseph|last=Sheils}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baptismal registers were to include child's name, seniority (e.g. first son), father's name, profession, place of abode and descent (i.e. names, professions and places of abode of the father's parents), similar information about the mother, and mother's parents, the infant's date of birth and baptism. Registers of this period are a gold-mine for genealogists, but the scheme was so much work for the parish priests that it did not last long.

In 1770 Dade wrote in the parish register of St. Helen's, York: "This scheme if properly put in execution will afford much clearer intelligence to the researches of posterity than the imperfect method hitherto generally pursued." His influence spread and the term Dade register has come to describe any parish registers that include more detail than expected for the time.

The application of this system was somewhat haphazard and many clergymen, particularly in more populated areas, resented the extra work involved in making these lengthy entries. The thought of duplicating them for the Bishop’s Transcripts put many of them off and some refused to follow the new rules. Several letters of complaint were printed in the York newspapers of the time, and the scheme suffered when the Archbishop indicated there was no punishment for vicars who failed to comply.

The [[Borthwick Institute for Archives]] recommends that researchers looking at Yorkshire parishes between 1770 and 1812 should check both sources.

===Barrington Registers===
From about 1783, as Lord Bishop of Salisbury, the Rt Rev. Shute Barrington instigated a similar system somewhat simpler than Dade's, and followed this in Northumberland and Durham from 1798, when he was translated to the diocese of Durham.

==Transcriptions and indices==
Most registers in the world have been deposited in diocesan archives or county record offices. Where these have been filmed, copies are available to scan from [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] through the [[Family History Library]]. Microfiche copies of parish registers, along with transcriptions, are usually available at larger local libraries and county record offices.

===England===
Since Victorian times, amateur genealogists have transcribed and indexed parish registers. Some societies have also produced printed transcripts and indexes — notably the Parish Register Society, the [[Harleian Society]] and [[William Phillimore Watts Phillimore|Phillimore &amp; Co]]. The [[Society of Genealogists]], in [[London]], has a very large selection of such transcripts and indexes. The LDS Library in [[Salt Lake City]] also has a vast collection of films of original registers.

The LDS, for its own purposes, has also produced an index (the [[International Genealogical Index|IGI]]), of very many register entries — mostly baptisms and marriages. The IGI is available as an online database  [http://www.familysearch.org] and on microform matter at local "Family History Centers". Like all transcripts and indexes, the IGI should be used with caution, as errors can occur in legibility of the original or microfilm of the original, in reading the original handwriting, and in entering the material to the transcription. "Batch entries" are generally more reliable than "individual submissions."{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3478">'''Pierre Willems''' (born [[Maastricht]], 6 January 1840; died [[Leuven]], 23 February 1898) was a Dutch [[philologist]] and historian of [[Ancient Rome]].

Following the custom of Belgian students he did not confine himself to the courses at [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] (French: ''Louvain'') but went to Paris to hear [[Julius Oppert]], [[Émile Egger]], and Henri Patin, and to Berlin, [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], and [[Leyden]], where he followed the courses of Cobet. On his return in 1865 he was appointed professor of Latin philology at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]]; here he spent the remainder of his life, the only events being his lectures and his works.

His two chief works are ''Le droit public romain'' (Roman Public Law), first issued under the title, ''Les antiquités romains envisagées au point de vue des institutions politiques'' (Louvain, 1870; 7th ed. by his son Joseph Willems, Louvain, 1910), and ''Le sénat de la republique romaine'' (3 vols., Louvain, 1878–85). The first work is a handbook which stops at [[Constantine I]] in the first three editions and now goes as far as [[Justinian I]]. The author combined systematic and historical order by dividing the history of Roman institutions into "epochs" and "periods", viz., epoch of royalty, epoch of the republic, epoch of the empire, subdivided into the period of the [[Principate]] and that of monarchy. In each of these sections Willems studies the conditions of persons, government, and administration.

The book on the [[Roman Senate]] shows more evidence of personal research. It contains a new opinion concerning the recruiting of the Senate; Willems does not admit that there were [[plebeian]] senators in the century following the expulsion of the kings. It was by the exercise of the ''curule'' magistracies that the plebs entered the Senate, in fact after 354-200; a [[plebiscite]] proposed by the [[Tribune]] Ovinius and accepted at the end of the fourth century hastened the introduction of the plebeians, and, in short, made the Senate an assembly of former magistrates.

He completed his work by a series of studies on the composition of the Roman Senate in 575-179, in 699-55 in his great work, and in A. D. 65 in the ''Musée belge'' (published by his son, 1902). He also contributed to the ''Bulletins'' of the Brussels Academy a memoir on the municipal elections of [[Pompeii]] (1902). He assisted in the foundation of the second Belgian periodical for classical philology, ''Le Musée belge'' (1897), and organized a ''Societas philologa'', at Louvain, one of the oldest members of which was the Liège professor, Charles Michel, author of the ''Recucit d'inscriptions grecques'' (1900–12). He belonged to the [[Flanders|Flemish]] party and collected materials for a work on the Flemish dialects, which remains unfinished.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10039">A '''progress trap''' is the condition human societies experience when, in pursuing progress through human ingenuity, they inadvertently introduce problems they do not have the resources or political will to solve, for fear of short-term losses in status, stability or quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Meek Lange|first=Margaret|title=Progress|date=2011|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2011/entries/progress/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2011|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prevents further progress and sometimes leads to [[societal collapse]].

The syndrome appears to have been first described by Walter Von Krämer, in his series of 1989 articles&lt;ref&gt;Von Krämer, W. ''Fortschrittsfalle Medizin (Medical progress traps)'', [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13493998.html Der Spiegel], 13 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt; under the title ''Fortschrittsfalle Medizin''. The specific neologism "progress trap" was introduced independently in 1990 by Daniel B. O'Leary with his study of the behavioral aspects of this condition.

The term subsequently gained attention following the [[historian]] and [[novelist]] [[Ronald Wright]]'s 2004 book and [[Massey Lecture]] series ''[[A Short History of Progress]]'', in which he sketches world history so far as a succession of progress traps. With the documentary film version of Wright's book ''[[Surviving Progress]]'', backed by Martin Scorsese, the concept achieved wider recognition. 

==Overview==

While the idea is not new, Wright identifies the central problem as being one of scale and political will. According to him, the error is often to extrapolate from what appears to work well on a small scale to a larger scale, which depletes natural resources and causes environmental degradation. Large-scale implementation also tends to be subject to [[diminishing returns]]. As [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[erosion]], [[greenhouse gas]] emissions or other consequences become apparent, society is destabilized.

In a progress trap, those in positions of authority are unwilling to make changes necessary for future survival. To do so they would need to sacrifice their current status and political power at the top of a hierarchy. They may also be unable to raise public support and the necessary economic resources, even if they try. Deforestation and erosion in ancient Greece may be an example of the latter.

A new source of natural resources can provide a reprieve. The European discovery and exploitation of the "New World" is one example of this, but seems unlikely to be repeated today. Present global civilization has covered the planet to such an extent there are no new resources in sight. Wright concludes that if not averted by some other means, collapse will be on a global scale, if or when it comes. Current economic crises, population problems and global climate change are symptoms that highlight the interdependence of current national economies and ecologies.

The problem has deep historical roots, probably dating back to the origins of life on Earth 3.8 billion years ago. In the early [[stone age]], improved hunting techniques in vulnerable areas caused the extinction of many prey species, leaving the enlarged populace without an adequate food supply. The only apparent alternative, [[agriculture]], also proved to be a progress trap. Salination, deforestation, erosion and urban sprawl led to disease, malnutrition and so forth, hence shorter lives.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

Almost any sphere of [[technology]] can prove to be a progress trap, as in the example of [[medicine]] and its possibly inadequate response to the drawbacks of the high-density agricultural practices (e.g. [[factory farming]]) it has enabled. Wright uses [[weapon]] [[technology]] gradually reaching the threat of total nuclear destruction to illustrate this point. Ultimately, Wright strives to counter at least the Victorian notion of "modernity" as unconditionally a good thing.

==Behavioral causes==

In ''Escaping the progress trap'', O'Leary finds that, besides vested interests and socioeconomic compliance, individual behavior is a significant contributing factor to progress traps, which are not limited to technology. This can be verified in terms of new information from the neurosciences, notably [[lateralization of brain function]], where the short-term goals of a man-made world are increasingly favoured over long-term global interests. His study of this shows how institutions and societies can become committed to an exclusive form of technocratic rationalism. In this scenario, humans diverge from a default interdependence with nature with the result that short-term technical preoccupations slowly inhibit creativity and long-term problem solving, thus compromising long-term interests. 

Where advances are created by technical specialization ''and'' are harmful; such as [[desertification]] resulting from mismanaged [[irrigation]]; this trend compounds itself and can be irreversible, with collapse resulting. Classic cases would be [[Sumer]] and the Indus Valley civilization where output-raising irrigation canals and logging slowly combined to make the fields far too salty to continue supporting the harvests on which the populations relied. 

Other examples, such as [[Seymour Cray]]'s overspecialized [[Control Data Corporation]] or the Medieval Church's rejection of [[Roger Bacon]]'s science follow the pattern: The mode of development itself excluded solutions to problems arising from that development. In a contemporary context, unabated [[oil consumption]] in a time of [[climate change]] is an illustration of the problem; [[sustainable development]] is viewed as a solution.

According to O'Leary, avoiding the progress trap pattern can be achieved by ensuring, through education and cultural vitality, that individuals and societies do not become preeminently [[technocratic]]. Citing research into [[creativity]] and resiliency theory, he argues that the intuitive side of the mind/brain must thrive, so that lateral thinking will be an option for seeing and preventing progress traps. Spelling this out in scientific terms may be necessary for policymakers to take notice.

Iain McGilchrist's 2009 book ''[[The Master and His Emissary]]'', provides neurological insight into behaviors where excessive attention to short-term interests might compromise long-term interests.

'''Roland Bauer''' (born [[Kraslice|Eibenburg]] 19 March 1928) is a former politician and history academic in the [[German Democratic Republic|German Democratic Republic (East Germany)]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bundesstiftung-aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=147|author1=[[Bernd-Rainer Barth]]|author2=|title=Bauer, Roland * 19.3.1928 SED-Funktionär, Vizepräsident der Historikergesellschaft |publisher= Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur: Biographische Datenbanken|accessdate= 8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was vice-president of the [[:de:Historiker-Gesellschaft der DDR|East German Historical Society]], a member of the central committee of the country's ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED (party)]] and of the [[:de:Stadtverordnetenversammlung|Berlin city council]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRB/&gt;

==Life==
Roland Bauer was born into a working-class family near [[Kraslice|Graslitz]] in the extreme west of Czechoslovakia. His family was part of the large German speaking minority that had settled the area in the centuries before the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 from a part of what had hitherto been [[Austria-Hungary]]. On leaving secondary school he undertook an apprenticeship as a watchmaker and jeweler. That lasted till 1944 when he was enlisted for [[Reichsarbeitsdienst|National Labour Service (''"Reichsarbeitsdienst"'')]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRB/&gt;

Although he was born in a frontier region, while he was growing up Bauer's family lived in [[Zelená Hora (Vyškov District)|Grünberg]] in the centre of Czechoslovakia, where his parents were members of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist Party]],   Roland Bauer himself was a member of the Communist "Pioneer" organisation from 1934 till 1938. As a communist party member Bauer's father was interned by the Germans in [[concentration camps]], first in [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] and later in [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]].

The [[Second World War|war]] ended in May 1945 and Roland Bauer, together with his parents, were among the millions of ethnic Germans who found themselves [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|relocated]]. They settled in the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet Occupation Zone (SBZ / ''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'')]] of what had been Germany, fetching up in the heart of [[Thuringia]], near [[Weimar]].&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRB/&gt;

Bauer joined the [[Free German Youth|Free German Youth (FDJ / ''Freie Deutsche Jugend'')]] and in 1946 joined the newly formed [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED (party)]], then in the process of becoming the country's ruling party, endorsed by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|occupying forces]],   Till 1947 Bauer worked as a watchmaker in [[Apolda]], taking a leading position with the FDJ locally. In 1947 he undertook a training at the party's regional college for [[Thuringia]] in [[Bad Berka]], and between 1947 and 1949 he was the party's district youth secretary for the [[Weimar]] district.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRB/&gt;

In 1949 Bauer embarked on a two-year study period at The [[Parteihochschule Karl Marx|Party's Karl Marx Academy]], after which he went on to become successively an assistant, a [[Docent|teacher]] and then deputy head of the [[History]] department. Between 1954 and 1958 he undertook [[:de:Aspirantur|postgraduate study]] at the Institute for Social Sciences run by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party Central Committee]] in [[Moscow]]. He received his [[doctorate]]&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRB/&gt; for a dissertation entitled "Precondidions and Groundrules for the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|November 1918 Revolution in Germany]] (Stage 1)" (''"Voraussetzungen und Grundzüge der [[:de:Novemberrevolution|Novemberrevolution 1918]] in Deutschland - 1. Etappe)"''),   From 1958 till 1962 Roland Bauer was a member of the management team at the [[Parteihochschule Karl Marx|Karl Marx Academy]], after which he became its deputy head.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRB/&gt;

From 1962 till 1964, in succession to [[:de:Ludwig Einicke|Ludwig Einicke]], Bauer served as Director of the Party Central Committee's [[:de:Institut für Marxismus-Leninismus|Institute for]] [[Marxism–Leninism]] in Berlin. Also between 1962 and 1964 he served as vice-president of the [[:de:Historiker-Gesellschaft der DDR|East German Historical Society]]. From 1964 till 1967 he served as the party's regional secretary for [[Agitprop|Agitation and Propaganda]] in Berlin, and at the same time, taking over from the journalist [[:de:Erich Selbmann|Erich Selbmann]] he also headed up [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|The party's]] Ideological Commission.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRB/&gt;   Between 1967 and 1978 Bauer served the Berlin region as Party Secretary for Science, popular education and training, a position in which he was succeeded, on 12 June 1978, by Horst Oswald.&lt;ref&gt;[[Berliner Zeitung]] 13 June 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

A switch towards the national political mainstream came with his candidature for the central committee of the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED (party)]], which lasted from 1967. He was elected to membership following the conventional waiting period at the [[:de:Parteitag der SED|8th Party Congress]] in 1971. From 1971 till 1978 he was a member of the Party Central Committee's Culture Commission and he was also, from 1971 till 1981 a member of the Berlin City Council. In 1976 he was involved in the exclusion from East German citizenship of [[Wolf Biermann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.spiegel.de/schulspiegel/kultur-die-hauptakteure-in-der-biermann-affaere-a-213377.html|title=Die Hauptakteure der Biermann-Affäre|author=|publisher=SPIEGEL-Verlag Rudolf Augstein GmbH &amp; Co.

KG.|date=23 November 1981|accessdate=9 December 2014|volume= 48/1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 Bauer succeeded [[:de:Rudolf Wettengel|Rudolf Wettengel]] as the East German Party's Central Committee representative on the editorial board of the politically important [[Prague]] based journal [[Problems of Peace and Socialism|Problems of Peace and Socialism (World Marxist Review / ''Проблемы мира и социализма'')]], remaining on the board till August 1990 representing the SED and then its successor party, the German [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS / ''Partei des Demokratischen Sozialismus'')]] through most of the period of the [[German reunification]] process.&lt;ref name=BiographischeDatenbankenRB/&gt;

Roland Bauer went into retirement, still living in Berlin, in August 1990,   In May 1991 he resigned from the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS (party)]].  Later he worked with [[Wolfgang Harich]] on the "Alternative Commission of Enquiry into the History of the German Democratic Republic".

Dr Benady was born in Gibraltar, where his family has lived since the 18th century, and received his Medicine degree in London. He worked as a paediatrician in [[Bristol]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Gibraltar]], where he ran the Child Health service. Benady worked for the [[Gibraltar Health Authority]] from 1980 until his retirement in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gha.gov.gi/AR2003%20Web/Management.htm GHA press note] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050102105304/http://www.gha.gov.gi/AR2003%20Web/Management.htm |date=2 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 he was appointed a MBE "for services to health care and voluntary work".&lt;ref name="MBE" /&gt;

==Work==
In 1990, Benady published the two short stories in ''[[Sherlock Holmes in Gibraltar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watt|first1=Peter Ridgeway|last2=Green |first2=Joseph|title=The Alternative Sherlock Holmes: pastiches, parodies, and copies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DBGn5AkrI40C&amp;dq=%22Sam+Benady%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=0-7546-0882-4|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pastiche]]s are set in the pre-[[Doctor Watson|Watson]] days. In the first one, ''The Abandoned Brigantine'', [[Sherlock Holmes]] reveals the solution to the mystery of the [[Mary Celeste]], while in the second, ''The Gibraltar Letter'', the detective solves the case of the abduction of the [[Duke of Connaught]] while he was posted to Gibraltar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://keysofcity.blogspot.com/2005/12/other-books-by-sam-benady.html Other books by Sam Benady], Sam Benady's blog.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, after reading ''La compra de Gibraltar por los conversos andaluces'', ("The purchase of Gibraltar by Andalusian ''conversos''"), a monograph by Diego Lamelas about the story of the [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordova]] ''[[converso]]s'' who purchased Gibraltar in the 15th century, Benady translated and published it in English as ''The Sale of Gibraltar in 1474''. Then, he approached the history of [[St. Bernard's Hospital]], publishing ''Civil Hospital and Epidemics in Gibraltar''. ''Diary of an Epidemic'' and ''Passing through the Fever'' (both co-authored with Prof. L A Sawchuk) were published in 2003 and 2005. In 2005, Benady approached the biography [[literary genre|genre]], publishing a work on Sir [[George Don (British Army officer)|George Don]], Lieutenant Governor of Gibraltar from 1814 to 1831.&lt;ref&gt;[http://keysofcity.blogspot.com/2005/12/about-author.html About the author], Sam Benady's blog.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foghs"&gt;[http://www.docstoc.com/docs/17739431/FRIENDS-OF-GIBRALTAR-HERITAGE-SOCIETY Newsletter no 81], Friends of Gibraltar Heritage Society, October 2007, pp. 6&lt;/ref&gt;''The Keys of the City: An Episode in the History of Gibraltar'', also published in 2005, is a historical novel based in his former translation of Lamelas' work. A Spanish translation by Cayetano Ramirez has been published in 2015 by Nagrela Editores of Madrid, with the title ''Las llaves de Gibraltar''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1976">'''Sequin and Knobel''', or Séquin and Knobel were a Swiss firm of architects notable for the design of industrial building such as [[cotton mill]]s and [[weaving shed]]s. It was formed in 1895. The partners were Carl Arnold Séquin and Hilarius Knobel. Together they were responsible for over 250 industrial buildings.

==Partners==

Carl Arnold Séquin-Bronner (born 25 January 1845 in [[Uznach]]; died 25 November 1899 in [[Rüti ZH]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanak|first1=Michael|title=Séquin, Carl Arnold|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D43592.php|website=Historisches Lexikon der Schweiz|accessdate=11 May 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilarius Knobel (born 1854 [[Glarus]]; died 1921 [[Zürich]]) was the son of the architect, Hilarius Knobel (born 4 February 1830 in [[Schwändi, near Schwanden, Glarus|Schwändi]]; died 25 February 1891 in Zürich) who was practising in Zürich in 1859.

==Buildings==

*[[Mechanische Baumwollspinnerei und Weberei Augsburg]] (TIM) In 1895/98 they extended the existing factory, by the [[Proviantbach]] in [[Augsburg]], adding a weaving shed for 640 [[power looms|automatic looms]] and a four storey spinning mill containing 42 000 spindles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3292">'''Spiegelman's Monster''' is the name given to an [[RNA]] chain of only 218 [[nucleotides]] that is able to be reproduced by the RNA replication enzyme [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]], also called RNA replicase.  It is named after its creator, [[Sol Spiegelman]], of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] who first described it in 1965.

==Description==
Spiegelman introduced RNA from a simple [[bacteriophage Qβ]] (Qβ) into a solution which contained Qβ's RNA replicase, some free nucleotides, and some salts.  In this environment, the RNA started to be replicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= Spiegelman, S., Haruna, I., Holland, I.B., Beaudreau, G. &amp; Mills, D. |year=1965 |title=The Synthesis of a Self-propagating and Infectious Nucleic Acid with a Purified Enzyme | journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |volume=54 |pages=919–927|pmc=219765 |pmid=5217468 |issue=3| doi= 10.1073/pnas.54.3.919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1073/pnas.58.1.217| title=An extracellular Darwinian experiment with a self-duplicating nucleic acid molecule| journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]| author =Mills, D. R., R. L. Peterson, Sol Spiegelman| year=1967| volume=58| issue=1| pages=217–24| pmid=5231602| pmc=335620}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a while, Spiegelman took some RNA and moved it to another tube with fresh solution. This process was repeated.&lt;ref name="monster"&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1073/pnas.69.10.3038| title=A Replicating RNA Molecule Suitable for a Detailed Analysis of Extracellular Evolution and Replication| journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]| author =Kacian,D.L.,  D.R. Mills, F.R. Kramer, S. Spiegelman| year=1972| pmid=4507621|volume=69| issue=10| pages=3038–3042| pmc=389702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shorter RNA chains were able to be replicated faster, so the RNA became shorter and shorter as selection favored speed. After 74 generations, the original strand with 4,500 nucleotide bases ended up as a dwarf genome with only 218 bases. This short RNA sequence replicated very quickly in these unnatural circumstances.

M. Sumper and R. Luce  of Eigen's laboratory demonstrated that a mixture containing no RNA at all but only RNA [[Nucleobase|bases]] and Qβ replicase can, under the right conditions, spontaneously generate self-replicating RNA which evolves into a form similar to Spiegelman's Monster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1073/pnas.72.1.162| title=Evidence for de novo production of self-replicating and environmentally adapted RNA structures by bacteriophage Qbeta replicase | journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] | last=Sumper | first=M |author2=R. Luce  | year=1975| volume=72 | issue=1 | pages=162–166 | pmid=1054493| pmc=432262| url=https://epub.uni-regensburg.de/22926/1/sumper45.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Note that despite the term self-replicating RNA, the RNA did not replicate itself: the Qβ enzyme is what made the RNA molecules.

==Career==

===Academic===
He has taught at [[Ohio State University]], [[University of Alberta]], [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]], and the [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]] (where he was the first Dowty Professor of Computer Systems Engineering).  Since 1993, he has held the Computer Science Trust Fund Eminent Scholar Chair in the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, where he is also a professor, Department of History and, from 1999 to 2013 was the Director of the Institute of Cognitive Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ics.louisiana.edu/director.html|title = Personal Webpage|publisher= University of Louisiana at Lafayette Cognitive Science Dept.|accessdate = 21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has held visiting appointments in [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College]], Oxford, the Computer Laboratory, Cambridge,  Simon Fraser University (Vancouver), the Indian Institute of Science and the Center for the Development of Advanced Computing, C-DAC (Bangalore, India), Aachen Technical University, and the University of Oldenberg (both in Germany).  He has served as a consultant for the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).
Dasgupta has featured in interviews and articles in multiple [[BBC Radio]] programs, British national newspapers and magazines, Indian national newspapers, and regional Spanish and Canadian newspapers.  His biographical entries appear in Who’s Who in America,  [[Who’s Who in the World]], Writers Directory, and Contemporary Authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/midweek_20060301.shtml|title = BBC Radio 4 Interview with Subrata Dasgupta|publisher= BBC Radio 4|accessdate = 21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subrata Dasgupta’s research from 1974 to 1991 spanned such branches of [[computer science]] as [[computer architecture]], microprogramming, hardware description languages, program verification, and design theory.  Since 1992, his work has focused on the cognitive and historical nature of creativity in the natural and artificial sciences, engineering and technology, art, literary scholarship, and cross-cultural milieux.  In addition to numerous papers, essays and articles, he is the author of fourteen books.

===Computer Science and the Sciences of the Artificial===
Influenced by Herbert Simon’s seminal book ''The Sciences of the Artificial'', Dasgupta has written extensively on the historical, epistemological and cognitive nature of the artificial sciences and, in particular, on computer science as a science of the artificial.  His books include:  ''The Design and Description of Computer Architectures'' (John Wiley, 1984), ''Computer Architecture: A Modern Synthesis.  Volume 1: Foundations''  and ''Volume 2: Advanced Topics'' (John Wiley, 1989), ''Design Theory and Computer Science'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=55599A0D6FCA44B3D6987BEF81932BF6.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4461244|title = Book Review in Robotica|publisher= Cambridge Journals|accessdate = 21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''It Began with Babbage : The Genesis of Computer Science'' (Oxford University Press, 2014) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/11/top-science-books-for-march|title = Book Selected in Top science books for March|publisher= The Guardian|accessdate = 21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was selected as an 'Outstanding Academic Title for 2014' by the journal Choice. Most recently, his ''Computer Science: A Very Short Introduction'' (2016) was published as a volume in Oxford University Press's best-selling and prestigious "Very Short Introductions" series.'

===Cognitive-Historical Studies of Creativity===
He has published numerous papers and essays on the cognitive-historical-biographical aspects of creativity in art, science, technology and scholarship in such print journals as [[Perspectives on Science]], Transactions of the [[Newcomen Society]],  [[Notes &amp; Records of the Royal Society]], Creativity Research Journal, Physics News, [[Physics of Life Reviews]] and the online journal PsyArt.  His books include ''Creativity in Invention and Design'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994), ''Technology and Creativity'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 1996),   ''Jagadis Chandra Bose and the Indian Response to Western Science'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/it-began-in-bengal-/20297|title = it began in Bengal by Atul Chaturvedi|publisher= The Indian Express|accessdate = 2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Twilight of the Bengal Renaissance: R.K. Dasgupta and His Quest for a World Mind'' (Dey’s Publishing, 2005), ''The Bengal Renaissance: Identity and Creativity from Rammohun Roy to Rabindranath Tagore'' (Permanent Black, 2007),  and ''Awakening: The Story of the Bengal Renaissance'' (Random House India, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://randomhouseindia.wordpress.com/2010/08/17/subrata-dasgupta-a-voice-of-her-own|title = Subrata Dasgupta: A voice of his Own|publisher= Random House India|accessdate = 23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his special interests is the nature of the creative mind spanning multiple cultures, especially the ‘Indo-Western mind’.  His work on the 19th century creative and intellectual movement in Bengal called the Bengal Renaissance addresses this mentality.

===Creative Writing===
Dasgupta’s interests in cross-cultural creativity has extended to ‘creative literary writing’ of both fiction and nonfiction.  He has published two novels, Three Times a Minority (Writers Workshop Calcutta, 2003), and The Golden Jubilee (Amaryllis, 2013), and a memoir of his English childhood, Salaam Stanley Matthews (Granta, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/salaam-stanley-matthews-by-subrata-dasgupta-526125.html|title = Book review of "Salaam Stanley Matthews" by Chitralekha Basu |publisher= The Independent UK|accessdate = 20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/mar/05/biography.features|title = Book review of "Salaam Stanley Matthews" |publisher= The Guardian|accessdate = 24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has recently completed another novel that explores cross-cultural psychology, titled Voice of the Rain Season.

A '''survivor registry''' is a list of survivors of a [[disaster]].  This assists families and acquaintances in re-establishing contact, after they have been separated
by the disruption caused by the disaster.

==Holocaust==
There are several databases of survivors of the Nazi genocide of Jewish people during World War II.  One of these is the ''Benjamin and Vladka Meed Registry of Holocaust Survivors'' which is now part of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Documentary testimonies: global archives of suffering |author=Bhaskar Sarkar |pages=37–38 |isbn=978-0-415-99664-8 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red Cross==
The Red Cross established a register of survivors of the [[SS Noronic]] disaster in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] |date=Sep 17, 1949 |title=Noronic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Survivors of the [[Hurricane Katrina]] disaster also registered with the Red Cross to help notify their friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The sociology of Katrina |chapter=Families and Hurricane Response |page=79 |isbn=978-0-7425-5930-1 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Trade Center==
Following the destruction of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], many telephone lines and transmission facilities were disrupted.  Computer programmer and [[science fiction]] writer [[William Shunn]] was in [[Queens]] nearby.  At about 11:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on September 11, in response to a friend's emailed suggestion that he maintain and circulate a list of acquaintances he had heard from thus far, Shunn posted the names of people he knew were okay on his personal web site and began sending the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] to other friends.  Keeping the list up-to-date proved difficult, as more emails flooded in than he could handle.  He quickly developed a simple database and form submission system so that visitors to the site could post their own names to the list.  This automated system debuted at around 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. that afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Online news: journalism and the Internet |author=Stuart Allan |chapter=Covering the Crisis: September 11 |pages=56–57 |isbn=978-0-335-22121-9 |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.cnet.com/2008-1082-272960.html |title=Online help spawns hope for victims |author=Charles Cooper |date=September 13, 2001 |publisher=CNET News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, a crew of programmers at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with vastly superior resources were working on a similar concept.  Their survivor registry went online at about 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern time.  While Shunn's site foundered and eventually crashed under the heavy load of submissions, the Berkeley site ran on a huge computer cluster, and for the next several days stood out as the most robust and accurate of the many survivor registries that followed.

One problem that plagued the survivor registries was that of inaccurate information.  So many entries listed actual victims as being okay that Berkeley eventually implemented a system that used cross-checks to gauge the accuracy of the information received.

The grassroots generation of survivor registries led many people to wonder why the Federal government did not have such a system already in place. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) has since discussed plans for official survivor registries in the future.

[[File:Thomas Worsnop.jpg|thumb|right]]

'''Thomas Worsnop''' (2 February 1821 – 24 January 1898) was an Australian colonial militia, historian, local government official and town clerk. Worsnop was born in [[Wortley, South Yorkshire|Wortley]], [[Yorkshire]], [[England]] and died in [[North Adelaide]], [[South Australia]].&lt;ref name="DAB Thomas Worsnop"&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=Helen R. |last= Mullins |id2= worsnop-thomas-4889 |title= Worsnop, Thomas (1821–1898) |accessdate=18 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Worsnop died on 24 January 1898 at his home in Barnard Street, North Adelaide.

Worsnop arrived in South Australia on 12 November 1852. He first settled at Port Elliot with his family and worked as a storeman, for seven years, for Elder, Stirling and Company. In 1859 he was appointed a sergeant in the South Australian Volunteers. For a time he worked on the land but not with great success. Then he tried work as a publican and in 1863 he was lessee of the Globe Inn in Rundle Street, but he was declared bankrupt in 1864. Next, Worsnop took up the drudgery of work as a teamster in the north. Finally, in September 1866 he became a clerk in the Town Clerk's department in Adelaide and on 11 January 1869 was appointed acting town clerk taking over permanently later that year.

Somewhat surprisingly, given his previous failures, Worsnop proved to be a good administrator and he was able to reduce the debt of the City Council. He was also most concerned with protecting the parklands and fascinated by the history of city and colony. In 1878 he wrote the detailed History of the City of Adelaide and later had published several papers on Aboriginal artefacts and weapons.

He is commemorated with the naming in his honour of Mount Worsnop in the Gibson Desert of Western Australia by Sir John Forrest on 15 July 1874.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22014">'''Vlachs in Bosnia and Herzegovina''' are a [[Balkans|Balkan]] tribe who descend from Romanized [[Illyrians]] and [[Thraco-Roman]]s, and other pre-Slavic [[Romance language|Romance]]-speaking peoples.{{sfn|Vego|1957|p=128}}{{sfn|Mužić (Radoslav Lopašić)|2010|p=19}}{{sfn|Mužić (Ćiro Truhelka)|2010|p=120–121}} They were semi-nomadic herdsmen, shepherds and farmers. They lived in tents or huts and traded livestock products. Vlach cheese was reputable because of its fat content and fetched high prices. With their caravans, Vlach carried out much of the traffic between inland and coastal cities such as [[Dubrovnik]]. [[Marko Vego]] argued that Vlach autochthony with Vlach settlements named after Vlach tribes, [[Vojnići]] and [[Hardomilje]], are found near Roman forts and monuments. Bogumil Hrabak supported Vego's assertion that the Vlachs preceded both Turks and Bosnian Slavs in [[Zachlumia]].{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=319}} [[Dominik Mandić]] argued that some Vlachs from [[Herzegovina]] migrated there from [[Thessaly]], [[Epirus]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] before the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman invasion]] into Southern Europe.{{sfn|Mužić (Bogumil Hrabak)|2010|p=202, 204}} It is argued that some also arrived from the East during the Ottoman wars.{{sfn|Mužić (Ćiro Truhelka)|2010|p=122}}

==History==
Vlachs are first mentioned in Bosnian documents in c. 1234 by ban [[Matej Ninoslav]]. Sources from 1361, 1385, 1399, 1406, 1407, 1408 and 1417 among others mention them in relation to Bosnian bans and kings.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=319}} The relationship of Vlachian ''katuns'' and feudal holdings can be traced from the 14th century.{{sfn|Kurtović|2011|p=648}} By 1382 they were under the jurisdiction of the Bosnian ruler, to later be assigned to large landowners.{{sfn|Kurtović|2011|p=694}} The Vlachs and lords relationships indicate that medieval Bosnia was not compact - some Vlach vassals (Gleđević) of the rulers were far from royal lands. Some Vlach vassals (Nenko Krajsalić, Radoslav Borojević) became vassals fairly late although Kosača ruled certain lands near Eastern banks of [[Neretva]] river for fifteen years. Some Vlach vassals (Maleš) were partly Pavlović and partly Kosača vassals although working on Kosača holdings.{{sfn|Kurtović|2011|p=694–695}}

In 1382, Vukoslav Piščić was named as ''knez'' of all Vlachs by King [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia]]. As the earliest noble landowners, in Herzegovina they were assigned to the [[Sanković noble family|Sanković]] noble family, with ''katun'' Tomić.{{sfn|Kurtović|2011|p=649–650}} In 1409, when Tvrtko I conquered parts of [[Rascia]] and [[Zeta]] they were located around 100 ''katuns''. They were mentioned as "Vlachorum congregationes et cetus".{{sfn|Vego|1957|p=128}} In the area around [[Stolac]] and [[Zabljak]] were so many Vlachs that at the end of the 15th century the territory was as ''Donji Vlasi'' (Lower Vlachs).{{sfn|Mužić (Ćiro Truhelka)|2010|p=122}} The ''Gornji Vlasi'' (Upper Vlachs) were only mentioned by [[Mavro Orbini]].{{sfn|Vego|1957|p=128}}

The 1376 and 1454 documents by [[Republic of Ragusa]] about trade with Bosnian lands mention ''Vlachi et Bosgnani''.{{sfn|Mužić|2010|p=230}} In the 1418 document by [[Nikolić noble family|Grgur Nikolić]], Vlachs, Serbs and Ragusians are clearly distinguished.{{sfn|Vego|1957|p=128–129}} In the 14th century documents, they are treated as shepherds from mountains that separate Croatia and Bosnia.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=318}} It is argued that some group of Vlachs in the 14th century migrated to [[Zagora (Croatia)|Zagora]] and [[Cetina]] county in Croatia, followed by the sudden appearance of [[stećak]]s in the territory they lived.{{sfn|Mužić|2009|p=318–319}}{{sfn|Mužić (Bogumil Hrabak)|2010|p=219}} At a time of social unrest, the Vlachs often fled to the area of Ragusa or [[Kotor]], served in the military of Ragusa during the Ottoman threat, and when most of Herzegovina was occupied by the Ottomans by 1472, once again fled to Ragusan territory.{{sfn|Vego|1957|p=129}}

Ottomans in Bosnia and Herzegovina, following the example of ''katuns'', organized ''filurîci eflakan'' (Vlachian filurîci) according to "Vlach model" in [[Smederevo]], [[Vidin]] and [[Braničevo District|Braničevo]].{{sfn|Mužić (Ćiro Truhelka)|2010|p=122}} From them was collected tax ''baduhava eflakan'',{{sfn|Mužić (Ćiro Truhelka)|2010|p=125}} or ''rusum eflak'',{{sfn|Malcolm|1994}} mostly in the form of sheep or goats, as well gold currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Matkovki |first=Aleksandar |date=1990 |title=Stočarski danak filurija |trans-title=Stockmen tribute filurîci |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/68960?lang=en |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=Arhivski vjesnik |issue=34 |location=Zagreb |publisher=Croatian State Archives |pages=71–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[defter]]s of the 1470s and 1480s in Central and North-Central Bosnia, around [[Visoko]] and [[Maglaj]], roughly 800 Vlachs arrived accompanied by two [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priests. With war and plagues, and as Catholics fled, the repopulation of Bosnia from Herzegovina and Serbia was of high interest for the Ottomans for their military activities. [[Benedikt Kuripečič]] in the 16th century noted that Bosnia is inhabited by three peoples; (Muslim) Turks, (Catholic) Bosnians and (Orthodox) Serbs "who call themselves Vlachs... They came from Smederevo and Belgrade".{{sfn|Malcolm|1994}} Since Vlachs weren't paid for military activity by the Ottomans they were permitted to plunder enemy territory, and became known as [[martolos]] or ''[[voynuk]]''. Their military activity earned them special tax privileges. In the late 15th century at least 35,000 Vlachs lived in Herzegovina, while in the 16th century 82,692 Vlach households lived in the [[Smederevo]] region in Serbia.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994}}

Living on the border of [[Habsburg Empire]] they relocated if the social situation was better on the other part of the border. There they received also a special social-militarh system. In 1527 [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] freed them from feudal obligations, shared booty with them, gave them their own captains (''vojvoda''s) and magistrates (''knez''es), and freed them to practice Orthodox Christianity. It eventually led to the organisation of the [[Military Frontier]], and the decree ''[[Statuta Valachorum]]'' by [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]]. It resulted in a situation almost looking like Vlachs fighting against Vlachs.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994}}

===Herzegovinian Vlachs===
In Southeastern Herzegovina between 1393–1437 many Vlachian ''katuns'' emerged.{{sfn|Mužić (Ćiro Truhelka)|2010|p=122}} The primary lords of the Herzegovinian Vlachs were the [[Kosača noble family|Kosača]], [[Pavlović noble family|Pavlović]], and [[Nikolić noble family|Nikolić]] noble families.{{sfn|Kurtović|2011|p=694}} The Vlachs from Herzegovina sometime plundered lands of [[Republic of Ragusa]] in the 14th and 15th century and grew rich by trade of goods between Ragusa and the mines of Bosnia.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994}}

Vlachs were surnamed Pliščić, Gleđević, Ugarac, Boban, Mirilović, Vragović, Kresojević, Nenković, Bančić, Pilatovac, Pocrnja, [[Drobnjaci|Drobnjak]] and [[Riđani]]. Some of the [[Banjani]] and [[Maleševci]] (Stanković) were Kosača vassals.{{sfn|Kurtović|2011|p=694}}

Vlachs surnamed Vlahović, Žurović, and Predojević, those belonging to the Pribač Nikolić pasture encampment, and some of the Banjan and Maleševac Vlachs (surnamed Hrebeljanović, Milićiević and Milošević) were Pavlovlić vassals.{{sfn|Kurtović|2011|p=694}}

The Kutlovići were vassals of the Nikolići. The Primilovići belonged to a larger group of Vlachs, for whom no data on lords were found.{{sfn|Kurtović|2011|p=694}}

Other ''katun'' Vlachs were Boljuni, Bukvići, Burmazi, Goduni, Hardomilići, Horojevići, Hrabreni, Jurjevići, Kersojevići, Kićurići, Kujavići, Milobradačići, Perventinići, Pribinovići, Rudinjani, Veseličići, Vitkovići, Vojnovići, Vragovići, Zotovići.{{sfn|Vego|1957|p=127–132}}

Vlachs often don't bear "tribe-katun" name as a surname, instead using patronymics, for example ''katunar'' Dragić Dobrilović from Boban ''katun'' or ''katunar''s Klapac Stanković and Radosav Milićević from Maleševac ''katun''.{{sfn|Kurtović|2011|p=655, 666}}

The Ottoman occupation conquered Vlachian territories which caused migrations; [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] documents in 1386 recorded that some Vlachians with their animals found shelter in [[Ston]] and [[Pelješac]] (''...quod recipiantur in Stagno familie, pastores, animalia et carnesia Vlacorum et circum vicinorum propter eorum saluamentum terrore Teucrurum partes discurrentium''),{{sfn|Krešić|2010|p=114}} in 1466 Korita, Banjani and Riđani east of [[Trebinje]] fell.{{sfn|Krešić|2010|p=111}} In 1448 Ragusa again accepted in Ston and Pelješac "peasants and Vlachs of duke Stjepan, Radoje Nikolić and Vukašin Grgurević with families and herds, with leaders and shepherds",{{sfn|Krešić|2010|p=115}} as well in 1463 (Vlachs and people from [[Popovo field|Popovo]]).{{sfn|Krešić|2010|p=116}} During the 15th century they continuously found shelter in the territory of Ragusan Republic, as well Venetian Dalmatia and [[Bay of Kotor]].{{sfn|Krešić|2010|p=116}} In 1475–1477 in the [[Nahiye (Ottoman)|nahija]] Počitelj eleven deserted villages (Gojanovići, Ričica, Kukrica, Opličiča, Plešivac, Svitava, Šanica, Kozica, Gornja Ljubinica, Skočim, Dretelj) were recorded, which were held by the Vlachs.{{sfn|Krešić|2010|p=120}} At the time many Vlachs (generally, and from Banjani, Maleševci, Bobani, Zubci) collaborated with Ottomans as slave agents.{{sfn|Krešić|2010|p=117–118}}

==Culture==
[[File:Radimlja, Nekropola2.JPG|thumb|Vlach funerary monuments in Radimlja]]
They lived in hamlets called ''katun'' whose chieftain were titled ''katunar''. Around them they placed guards: guard stations were called ''varde''/''vardišta''.{{sfn|Mužić (Ćiro Truhelka)|2010|p=121}} They were semi-nomadic herdsmen and shepherds, and who became agricultural when settled permanently. They lived in tents or primitive huts. They exported livestock products; animal skin, wool, cheese, butter and dried meat. Other exports included honey and wood. The Vlach cheese was reputable because of fat, and in 1325 sold one [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|libra]] for 10 folars compared to other cheese that sold for 8 folars. In 1420 Vlach cheese was sold for 15 folars.{{sfn|Vego|1957|p=129}} With their caravans, led by ''kramar'',{{sfn|Vego|1957|p=129}} mostly composed of horses numbering between 10-100, they conducted a large part of the trade between inland and coastal cities.{{sfn|Vego|1957|p=128}}{{sfn|Mužić (Ćiro Truhelka)|2010|p=122}}{{sfn|Malcolm|1994}} Their military tradition and mobile lifestyle was used by the Bosnian lords and later by the Ottomans.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994}} These traits changed very little over the centuries.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994}}

The emergence of the [[stećak]]s and their symbolism in Bosnia and Herzegovina by the scholars is often related to Vlachian communities.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kurtović |first=Esad |title=Vlasi i stećci |trans-title=Vlachs and stećaks |url=https://www.academia.edu/31355647/Vlasi_i_ste%C4%87ci |year=2013 |journal=Radovi |issue=16 |publisher=Filozofski fakultet |location=Sarajevo |language=Bosnian |pages=79–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=19}}

==Language==
Vlachs probably were bilingual (speaking Romance and Slavic languages).{{sfn|Malcolm|1994}} Many personal names in the records, of which many are preserved, indicate their bilingualism.{{sfn|Malcolm|1994}} Initially Vlachs used an Ikavian accent and later I/jekavian accent (speading it further), of [[Shtokavian dialect#Neo-Shtokavian|Neo-Shtokavian dialect]] of [[Serbo-Croatian]]. Those who migrated to the West during Ottoman invasion spoke what are now labeled [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect|Eastern Herzegovinian]] and Bosnian–Dalmatian subdialects.{{sfn|Šarić|2009|p=346–350}}{{sfn|Malcolm|1994}} [[Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography|LZMK]] linguist Nataša Bašić argued that the Vlachs were creators of New-Shtokavian dialect with reduced number of cases in declination, with New-Shtokavian accent, with the loss of the phoneme /[[H]]/, with diphthongization old ''[[Yat|jat]]'' and other modifications characteristic for foreigners, especially for [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].{{sfn|Mirdita|2004|p=333}} [[Ćiro Truhelka]] argued that the evasion of the writing and spelling letter /H/ in [[Serbian language]] until [[Vuk Karadžić|Karadžić]]'s reform is due to Vlachs influence as it is a Romance language characteristic.{{sfn|Mužić (Ćiro Truhelka)|2010|p=121}}

Truhelka noted many preserved non-Slavic family surnames in Bosnia and Herzegovina of Vlachian origin, which are often Slavicized by suffixes ''ić'', ''ović'' and ''ević'', with most notable being; Banjan, Balac, Bilbija, Boban, Bokan, Banduka, Bencun, Belen, Bender, Besara, Bovan, Čokorilo, Darda, Doman, Drečo, Đerman, Gac, Gala, Jarakula, Kalin, Kešelj, Keser, Kočo, Kalaba, Kokoruš, Kosor, Lopar, Macura, Mataruga, Pađen, Palavestra, Punja, Riđan, Šola, Šolaja, Šabat, Šurla, Šatra, Škipina, Špira, Tubin, Taor, Tintor, as well Kecman, Šikman, Toroman, Šuman, Karan, Šurlan, Servan.{{sfn|Mužić (Ćiro Truhelka)|2010|p=129}}

==Religion==
[[Pope Gregory XI]] in 1372 letter for [[Franciscan Province of Bosna Srebrena|Franciscans in Bosnia]] ordered them to convert Vlachs who live in tents and pastures (''Wlachorum... quorum nonnulli in pascuis et tentoriis habitant'').{{sfn|Vego|1957|p=128}} Their religion depended upon social and political events.{{sfn|Mužić (Ćiro Truhelka)|2010|p=126}} During Ottoman occupation the Orthodox Church was more politically favored than Roman Catholic.{{sfn|sfn|Mužić (Ćiro Truhelka) }} The first Orthodox churches in Bosnia and Herzegovina were built in the 13th century. With time the Slavicized Vlachs who were of Orthodox faith were [[Serbianisation|Serbianized]], while those of Roman Catholic faith were [[Croatisation|Croatized]].{{sfn|Mužić (Ćiro Truhelka)|2010|p=121, 128}}

==Notable Vlach==
*[[Telli Hasan Pasha|Hasan Pasha Predojević]]{{sfn|Kurtović|2011|p=243}} (c. 1530 – 22 June 1593) - the Predojević Vlachs are first mentioned 1372, while since 1468 were included in the Ottoman hierarchy.{{sfn|Kurtović|2011|p=675–677}}
