      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7961">In [[communication theory]], the '''Allen curve''' is a graphical representation that  reveals the exponential drop in frequency of communication between engineers as the distance between them increases. It was discovered by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Professor [[Thomas J. Allen]] in the late 1970s.

A related and highly significant finding of Allen's was his identification of the key role of information gatekeepers. Often such interlocutors were poorly recognized by management and yet conveyed vital concepts from just the right people to just the right other people in the organization.


== Discovery ==

During the late 1970s, Allen undertook a project to determine how the distance between engineers’ offices affects the frequency of technical communication between them. The result of that research produced what is now known as the Allen Curve, revealing a strong negative correlation between physical distance and the frequency of communication between work stations. The finding also revealed the critical distance of 50 meters for weekly technical communication.

This finding was originally documented in Allen’s book, ''Managing the Flow of Technology''.&lt;ref name="Book1"&gt;{{cite book

== Recent development ==
With the fast advancement of internet and sharp drop of telecommunication cost, some{{who|date=July 2018}} wonder about the application of the Allen Curve in today's corporate environment. In his recently co-authored book, Allen examined this question and the same still holds true. He says&lt;ref name="Book2"&gt;{{cite book

:"''For example, rather than finding that the probability of telephone communication increases with distance, as face-to-face probability decays, our data show a decay in the use of '''all''' communication media with distance (following a "near-field" rise).''" [p. 58]

He further explains&lt;ref name="Book2"/&gt;
:"''We do not keep separate sets of people, some of whom we communicate with by one medium and some by another. The more often we see someone face-to-face, the more likely it is that we will also telephone that person or communicate by another medium.''" [p. 58]

== Significance ==

With the wide acknowledgment of importance of communication to innovation, the Allen Curve has been taught and cited in all management literature about innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Whereas many researchers lean towards a 'Full Transfer' view in which all the L1 [[grammar]] transfers&lt;ref&gt;Unsworth, Parodi, Sorace &amp; Young-Scholten (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; - i.e. the initial state of the L2 is the final state of the first - Young-Scholten and Vainikka have argued that only lexical categories (e.g. the [[noun phrase]]) are drawn from the L1, and that functional categories (e.g. the [[inflectional phrase]] that represents [[Grammatical tense|tense]]) do not; rather, the learner 'grows' new ones because they start their L2 acquisition with only a 'minimal' [[Concrete syntax tree|syntactic tree]].

Several competing accounts for the role of transfer and universal grammar persist in SLA; the Minimal Trees Hypothesis remains particularly controversial, and has been strongly critiqued in syntactic research on both empirical and conceptual grounds: some researchers argue that linguistic behaviour does not follow the model,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. White (1991), for [[French language|French]].&lt;/ref&gt; and others claim that it is theoretically misconceived.&lt;ref&gt;White (2003: 68-78), for review; Schwartz &amp; Sprouse (1994); Schwartz (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the idea that a component of language could be absent from the initial stage, so that the system selectively extracts only one part of the L1, is unacceptable to those who favour 'Full Transfer' rather than 'Partial Transfer'.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz &amp; Sprouse (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical distribution==
In [[Lower Subansiri district]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], Apatani is spoken in 7 villages in Ziro valley, namely Hong, Hari, Biilla, Dutta, Hija, Mudang-Tage, and Bamin Michi (''Ethnologue'').

==Writing system==
Like most endangered oral languages, Apatani did not have a standardized [[orthography]], until recently, and there was some debate among the Apatanis on which [[Writing system|script]] should be used to transcribe it. In view of this, Tanw Supuñ Dukuñ, the apex Tanw organization, recommended the constitution of the Apatani Language Development Committee (ALDC). The Apatani Cultural and Literary Society (ACLS) constituted the ALDC to recommend a writing system of the language. A year-long discussion and study by ALDC resulted in the recommendation of an alphabet based on [[Roman script]]. The recommendation was accepted by the ACLS and the administrative approval for its use was given by the Tanw Supuñ Dukuñ, or the Apatani Apex Council.

==Apatani (Tanw) Language Development==
Language development is gradual process and in case of Apatani (Tanw) Language the development has been unrestrained so far. Yet, Tanw (Apatani) People have been writing Tanw using English Alphabets. And what began as a means to communicate through writing has now grown into a writing system that has emerged as a simple and easy means of communication for Tanw people. Apatani (Tanw) People live at a beautiful tiny valley known to the world as Ziro, located at Central Arunachal Pradesh. The total indigenous population is merely around 60,000 strong but Apatanis (Tanws) are known for their fervor when it comes to preservation and promotion of their unique culture that they closely share with their surrounding Tribes belonging to same [[Tani (tribes)|Tani Group]].

Currently, there are some positive initiatives with regard to Tanw Language development. The most relevant ones are revision project by Popi Sarmin Society (the pioneer in Tanw Script development), [http://www.henkako.com Apatani-English Dictionary] and [[Talking Apatani Dictionary]]. There are some differences on usage of some basic symbols and their usage. However, these developments are positive sign and they are giving momentum to public awareness regarding the urgent need for Tanw Language Development and Preservation.

==How Apatani is written==
Tanw words can be written meaningfully using English consonants and vowels "as is". Currently, the writing system is under rapid development and there are various proposals that has been put forward and active research work is ongoing. In the meantime, people may write using the system as proposed by the ALDC (Apatani Language Development Committee) or use the simplified system with minimum change and retaining English consonants, vowels and sounds. So far, the only government of Arunachal Pradesh approved Apatani Script '''(order No.EDA.41/96-97 Pt. dated Itanagar the 2nd Nov, 2010)''' is developed by the Popi Sarmin Society and '''KIIJE TANII AGUN CHINSA''' is being used for elementary third language studies at schools in Ziro.

However, it is to be noted that as any language, Apatani or Tanw language is evolving while it interacts with various languages such as English, Hindi, Assamese, etc. and as such it may not be correct to conclude on any specific writing structure as of now. For Tanw language, it a work in progress.

'''Bengkulu''' or '''Central Malay''', is a Malayan language spoken on the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Sumatra]], around the city of [[Bengkulu City|Bengkulu]]. It is more closely related to other Malay variants in Sumatra such as [[Col language|Col]], [[Jambi Malay]] and [[Musi language|Palembang Malay]] as well [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]] spoken in neighbouring [[West Sumatra]] than to [[Rejangese language]], which is also spoken in the province.

'''Betanure Jewish Neo-Aramaic''', the local [[dialect]] of [[Betanure]], is among the rarest and most seriously endangered varieties of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] spoken at the present time.&lt;ref name="preface" /&gt; It is also one of the most conservative of the [[Jew]]ish Neo-Aramaic languages, and among the Northeastern Aramaic languages.&lt;ref name="preface" /&gt;

==History==
In the 1940s, Betanure Jewish Neo-Aramaic was spoken by seventeen large families in the Jewish village of [[Betanure]].&lt;ref name="preface" /&gt; The community migrated in its entirety to [[Israel]] in 1951.&lt;ref name="preface" /&gt; Ever since the dialect has been facing erosion from Israeli Hebrew and from other [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]] varieties spoken in Israel.&lt;ref name="preface" /&gt;

[[File:Marquee Sign.jpg|thumb|right|282px|Man on a ladder, changing the billing on a [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]] in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].]]
'''Billing''' is a [[performing arts]] term used in referring to the order and other aspects of how [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]] are presented for plays, films, television, or other creative works. Information given in billing usually consists of the companies, [[actor]]s, [[film director|director]]s, [[film producer|producer]]s, and other crew members.

==Films==
===History===
From the beginning of motion pictures in the 1900s to the early 1920s, the moguls that owned or managed big film studios did not want to bill the actors appearing in their films because they did not want to recreate the [[Star system (filmmaking)|star system]] that was prevalent on Broadway at that time.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} They also feared that, once actors were billed on film, they would be more popular and would seek large salaries. Actors themselves did not want to reveal their film careers to their stage counterparts via billing on film, because at that time working in the movies was unacceptable to stage actors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} As late as the 1910s, stars as famous as [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]] were not known by name to moviegoers. According to Mary Pickford's biography ''Doug and Mary'',&lt;ref&gt;Doug &amp; Mary: A biography of Douglas Fairbanks &amp; Mary Pickford, by Gary Carey, E.P. Dutton, 1977, {{ISBN|978-0-525-09512-5}} p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; she was referred to by the public as "the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company|Biograph]] girl" in all of her films before 1905.

Before [[Mary Pickford]], the public used to call [[Florence Lawrence]] the "[[Biograph girl]]". In 1910 Lawrence was lured away from Biograph by [[Carl Laemmle]] when he started the [[Independent Motion Picture Company]] (IMP). Laemmle wanted Lawrence to be his star attraction, so he offered her more money ($250 per week) and marquee billing, something Biograph did not allow. She signed on; with the release of her first IMP film, ''[[The Broken Oath (1910 Film)|The Broken Oath]]'', she became the first film star to receive billing on the credits of her film.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} From then on, actors received billing on film. Also originating during that time was the system of billing above and below the title, to delineate the status of the players. Big stars such as Pickford, Fairbanks, and Chaplin were billed above the title, while lesser stars and supporting players were billed below the title.

During the era of the [[studio system]], on-screen billing was presented at the beginning of a film; only a restatement of the cast and possibly additional players appeared at the end, because the studios had actors under contract and could decide billing. The studios still followed the billing system of the silent era.

After the studio system's collapse in the 1950s, actors and their agents fought for billing on a film-by-film basis. This, combined with changes in union contracts and copyright laws, led to more actors and crew members being included in the credits sequence, expanding its size significantly. As a result, since the late 1960s,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} a significant amount of the billing is reserved for the [[closing credits]] of the film, which generally includes a recap of the billing shown at the beginning. In addition, more stars began to demand top billing.

Billing demands even extended to publicity materials, down to the height of the letters and the position of names.

By the 1990s, some films had moved all billing to the film's end, with the exception of company logos and the title. Although popularised by the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series (see below) and used sporadically in films such as ''[[The Godfather]]'' and ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', this "title-only" billing became an established form for summer blockbusters in 1989, with ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'', ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'', and ''[[The Abyss]]'' following the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/keyword/no-opening-credits/ Keyword 'no opening credits'] from [[IMDb]]&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, even the title is left to the end, such as in ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', ''[[Inception]]'', and [[Batman in film#Christopher Nolan.27s .22Dark Knight.22 Trilogy|the "Dark Knight" trilogy]].

===Billing order===
{{see also|Opening credits#Common opening credits order}}
The order in which credits are billed generally signify their importance. While there are numerous variations, most opening credits use some variation of the following basic order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/feature/1998/10/09feature.html |title=Glatzer (October 1998). "Movie credits 101" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220075448/http://www.salon.com/entertainment/feature/1998/10/09feature.html |archivedate=December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of opening credits, these roles will often be credited in reverse order at the beginning of the [[closing credits]].

* Name of the [[film studio]](s) 
* Production company(ies)
* [[Possessory credit]]s
* Above-title billed actor(s)
* Film title
* [[Actor|Main cast]]
* Last billed actor(s)
* [[Casting (performing arts)|Casting director(s)]]
* [[Film score|Composer(s)]]
* [[Visual effects supervisor]](s)
* [[Costume designer]](s)
* [[Film editor]](s)
* [[Production designer]](s)
* [[Director of photography|Director(s) of Photography]]
* [[Film producer|Producer(s)]] and [[Executive producer|Executive Producer(s)]]
* [[Screenwriter|Screenwriter(s)]]
* [[Film director|Director(s)]]

=== Studio vs. production company ===
The name of the [[film studio|studio]] that is normally credited is the one that distributed the film. However, a studio may not necessarily be the party that produced it. Instead, a separate [[production company]] may have actually made the film or financed a substantial part of the film.

=== Possessory credits ===
{{Main|Possessory credit}}
Depending on their standing, the director may be granted an extra, prominent credit before the film's title (as in "A [[Ridley Scott]] Film"); this practice began with directors such as [[Otto Preminger]], [[David Lean]] and [[John Frankenheimer]] in the mid-1960s. Sometimes the producer or writer may also get a possessory credit. Up until the establishment of the director's possessive credit, in the early 1970s, some directors were so highly regarded that they received what seems to be a producer's credit, even if they did not produce the film. [[Victor Fleming]] was one such director: his films usually featured the credit "A Victor Fleming Production", even when someone else produced the film. [[James Whale]] was similarly credited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001843/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[Kevin Smith]] refuses to use a possessory credit, such as "A Kevin Smith Film", feeling that a movie is made by everyone involved, and not the product of just the director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Top and above-title billing ===
The [[actor]]s whose names appear first are said to have "top billing". They usually play the principal characters in the film and have the most screen time. Frequently, top-billed actors are also named in advertising material such as [[trailer (Movie)|trailers]], [[movie poster|posters]], [[billboard (advertising)|billboards]] and [[Television advertisement|TV spots]].

The two or three top-billed actors in a movie will usually be announced prior to the title of the movie; this is referred to as "above-title billing". For an actor to receive it, he/she will generally have to be well-established, with box-office drawing power. Those introduced afterward are generally considered to be the supporting cast. Well-known actors may be given top billing for publicity or contractual purposes if juvenile, lesser-known, or first-time performers appear in a larger role: e.g., [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Gene Hackman]] were both credited before the title in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978), while [[Christopher Reeve]], the then-unknown actor who played the [[Superman|titular character]] and protagonist, was not, even though Brando only appears in the introduction while Hackman was the main antagonist. Similarly in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', Brando was billed first though he only appears at the end as the film's chief antagonist, while [[Robert Duvall]] was billed second despite a brief supporting role that earned him an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor, and [[Martin Sheen]] who portrayed the main character was billed third.

It used to be common practice to give top billing based on a person's level of fame, regardless of the significance of their role in the film. For example, Marlon Brando received top billing in ''[[The Godfather]]'' (although he had less on-screen time than [[Al Pacino]]'s character; Pacino was displeased that he was only nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar while Brando received the Oscar nod for Best Actor in a Leading Role), ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (see above), and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (also see above). [[Maximilian Schell]] was billed fifth in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' after [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Richard Widmark]], and [[Marlene Dietrich]], yet Schell went on to win the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role.  In recent decades, however, the practice of giving top billing to a star actor has largely been discontinued especially if they only play a [[bit part]]; some major actors may have a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] where they are only noted within the other cast during the end credits.

If an unfamiliar actor has the lead role, he may be listed last in the list of principal supporting actors, his name prefixed with "and introducing" (as [[Peter O'Toole]] was in ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'') However "and introducing" is now mostly used in feature films by a young actor (usually a child) who appears for the first time in a motion picture. Sometimes, he may not receive special billing even if his role is crucial. For example, the then-unknown [[William Warfield]], who played Joe and sang "[[Ol' Man River]]" in the [[Show Boat (1951 film)|1951 film version]] of ''[[Show Boat]]'', received tenth billing as if he were merely a bit player, while [[Paul Robeson]], an established star who played the same role in the [[Show Boat (1936 film)|1936 film version]] of the musical, received fourth billing in the 1936 film.

If more than one name appears at the same time or of a similar size, then those actors are said to have "equal billing," with their importance decreasing from left to right. However, an instance of "equal importance" is ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974) starring [[Steve McQueen]] and [[Paul Newman]]. The two names appear simultaneously with Newman's on the right side of the screen and raised slightly higher than McQueen's, to indicate the comparable status of both actors' characters (this also features on the advertising poster).

If a film has an [[ensemble cast]] with no clear lead role, it is traditional to bill the participants alphabetically or in the order of their on-screen appearance. An example of the former is ''[[A Bridge Too Far (1977 film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' (1977), which featured 14 roles played by established stars, any one of whom would have ordinarily received top billing as an individual.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The cast of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films includes many recognized stars who are billed alphabetically, but after the three principals who were initially child actors.

In the case of the [[Kenneth Branagh]] ''[[Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet]]'', there were many famous actors playing supporting or bit roles, and these actors were given prominent billing in the posters along with the film's actual stars: Branagh, [[Derek Jacobi]], [[Julie Christie]], and [[Kate Winslet]]. In the actual film's credits, they (along with the other actors in the film) were listed in alphabetical order and in the same size typeface.

If an actor is not an established star, he or she may not receive above-the-title billing, or even "star" billing; they may just be listed at the head of the cast. This is the way that all of the actors were listed in the opening credits to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''; [[Judy Garland]], although listed first, was given equal billing to all the others, with the cast list reading "with Judy Garland, Frank Morgan, Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr, Jack Haley," etc. [[F. Murray Abraham]], a supporting actor at the time of ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'', did not receive special star billing although he played the lead role of [[Antonio Salieri]]; his onscreen credit reads "with F. Murray Abraham", although his name does appear first in the cast.

In some cases, the position of a name in the credits roll can become a sticking point for both cast and crew. Such was the case on the sixties TV [[sitcom]] ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'', where two of the stars were only mentioned by name in the closing credits. In fact, the characters of The Professor ([[Russell Johnson]]) and Mary Ann ([[Dawn Wells]]) were the only ones whose mention in the opening theme song was abbreviated simply as "the rest" in the show's first season. [[Bob Denver]], who played Gilligan, was so upset with this treatment that he reportedly told the producers that since his contract stipulated that his name could appear anywhere in the credits that he wished, he wanted to be moved to the end credits with his co-stars. From the show's second season, the studio capitulated, and moved Denver's co-stars to the opening credits of the show, and also changed the theme song's lyrics to include "The Professor and Mary Ann" instead of saying "and the rest".{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

====Competitive top billing====
Sometimes actors can become highly competitive over the order of billing. For example:

[[Spencer Tracy]] was originally cast to play the lead opposite [[Humphrey Bogart]] in ''[[The Desperate Hours (film)|The Desperate Hours]]'' (1955) but when neither actor would relinquish top billing, Tracy withdrew and was replaced by [[Fredric March]], who took second billing to Bogart. Bogart's role in the film had earlier been played on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] by [[Paul Newman]] but the young actor was not considered for the movie version since Newman, viewed by studios at the time as mainly a stage and television actor only beginning his movie career, was in no position to compete with Bogart. Spencer Tracy would also later back out of co-starring in the 1965 film  ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]'' when he learned he would have to take second billing behind the film's star [[Steve McQueen]]. The role Tracy had been cast in went instead to [[Edward G. Robinson]], whom McQueen had idolized from childhood. Whenever it was pointed out to Spencer Tracy that he routinely took top billing in his films with [[Katharine Hepburn]], he responded, "It's a movie, not a lifeboat."

[[Clark Gable]] had a top billing clause written into his [[MGM]] contract and made three major films in the 1930s with Spencer Tracy in supporting roles (''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'', ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]'', and ''[[Boom Town (film)|Boom Town]]''), but when Tracy renegotiated his contract during [[World War II]], he had the same clause included in his own contract, effectively ending the hugely popular Gable-Tracy team.

In the opening credits of ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (1957), [[Alec Guinness]], who is generally regarded as the main character in the film, receives third billing, after [[William Holden]] (who demanded top billing) and [[Jack Hawkins]] (who does not even appear until halfway through the picture). In the closing credits, Guinness is billed second with Hawkins third.

[[File:The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.jpg|thumb|''The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'' (1962)]]
For ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]'' (1962), [[James Stewart]] was given top billing over [[John Wayne]] in the movie's posters and the previews (trailers) shown in [[cinemas]] and on television prior to the film's release, but in the film itself, Wayne is accorded top billing. Their names are displayed on pictures of signposts, one after the other, with Wayne's name shown first with his sign mounted slightly higher on its post than Stewart's. Director [[John Ford]] remarked in an interview with [[Peter Bogdanovich]] that he made it apparent to the audience that [[Vera Miles]]' character had never entirely recovered from an abortive romance with Wayne's gunslinging rancher because "I wanted Wayne to be the lead."&lt;ref&gt;''Who The Devil Made It: Conversations with Legendary Film Directors'' by [[Peter Bogdanovich]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Robert Redford]] used precisely the same billing formula for ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'' (1976), with Redford receiving top billing in posters and trailers while Hoffman was billed over Redford in the film itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.impawards.com/1976/all_the_presidents_men.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

As both [[Tony Curtis]] and [[Jerry Lewis]] wanted top billing for ''[[Boeing Boeing (1965 film)|Boeing Boeing]]'' ([[1965 in film|1965]]), their animated names appeared in a spinning, circular fashion in front of an airplane engine's rotating [[nacelle]].&lt;ref name="tcmcurtis"&gt;''Private Screenings: Tony Curtis''. [[Turner Classic Movies]], 19 Jan 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; For the trailer, the circular animation of the two names was repeated and neither name was spoken aloud. For the posters, the names made an X, Lewis' going up from the bottom left and Curtis' going down from the upper left.


For the film ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974), [[Steve McQueen]], [[Paul Newman]] and [[William Holden]] all tried to obtain top billing. Holden was refused as his diminished star power was no longer considered to be in the league of McQueen's and Newman's. To provide dual top billing and mollify McQueen, the credits were arranged diagonally, with McQueen at the lower left and Newman at the upper right. Thus, each actor appeared to have top billing depending on whether the poster was read from left to right or top to bottom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art.com/asp/sp-asp/_/pd--10134441/The_Towering_Inferno_Style_A.htm The Towering Inferno Masterprint at Art.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Technically, McQueen has top billing and is mentioned first in the film's trailers; however, at the end of the movie, as the cast's names roll from the bottom of the screen, Newman's name is fully visible first, giving him top billing in the closing credits. This was the first time that this type of "staggered but equal" billing had been used for a movie, although the same thing had been discussed for the same two actors five years earlier when McQueen was going to play the [[Harry Longabaugh|Sundance Kid]] in ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' (1969). McQueen ultimately passed on the part and was replaced by [[Robert Redford]], who did not enjoy McQueen's status and took second billing to Newman. Today, it has become understood that whoever's name appears to the left has top billing,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} but this was by no means the case when ''The Towering Inferno'' was produced. This same approach has often been used subsequently, including 2008's ''[[Righteous Kill]]'' starring [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Al Pacino]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.impawards.com/2008/righteous_kill.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities (film)|The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'' (1990), [[F. Murray Abraham]] asked for above-title billing. This was rejected as too many other stars were getting it ([[Tom Hanks]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Melanie Griffith]]). Thus, Abraham asked for his name to be completely removed, even from the closing credits. That same year, [[Raúl Juliá]] requested above the title billing alongside Robert Redford and Lena Olin for the drama ''[[Havana (film)|Havana]]''. When the producers rejected this, he decided to go uncredited. Eleven years later, [[Don Cheadle]] did exactly the same thing when his name wasn't allowed to appear above the title in ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]'' (2001), presumably because his name would have alphabetically preceded [[George Clooney]]'s and, unlike with the later sequels, the cast above the title was presented alphabetically (Clooney, [[Matt Damon]], [[Andy García]], [[Brad Pitt]], and [[Julia Roberts]]). Cheadle removed his name from the credits.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.impawards.com/2001/oceans_eleven_ver2.html&lt;/ref&gt; The producers apparently wanted Clooney, not Cheadle, to be the first name a casual viewer of the advertising would see.

In ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989), [[Jack Nicholson]] received top billing (along with the highest salary and a percentage of profits) as an established actor, even though [[Michael Keaton]] played the [[Batman|titular character]] while Nicholson's Joker was the main antagonist.

In the film ''[[Miami Vice (film)|Miami Vice]]'' (2006), [[Colin Farrell]] originally received top billing. However, after [[Jamie Foxx]] won an [[Academy Award]] he requested top billing and received it despite his role actually being much smaller than Farrell's. Foxx's name appears first in the opening credits, while Farrell still receives top billing in the closing credits.

In a commercial for ''[[Michael and Michael Have Issues]]'' (2009), the aforementioned characters mock-argue over who gets top billing for their show.

===Last billing===
An actor may receive "last billing", which usually designates a smaller role played by a famous name. They are usually credited after the rest of the lead cast, prefixed with "and" (or also "with" if there is more than one, as [[Samuel L. Jackson]] was in the latter two [[Star Wars#Prequel trilogy|''Star Wars'' prequels]]). In some cases, the name is followed by "as" and then the name of the character (sometimes called an "and-as" credit). This is not the case if that character is unseen for most of the movie (see [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]).

An early last billing credit in a film's opening simply listed a question mark (?) as portraying the monster in the 1931 classic ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', which still lists it that way today, although the reissued prints seen today add actor [[Boris Karloff]] to the end credit listings, as the film made him a huge star such that the credits of the film's first sequel ''[[The Bride of Frankenstein]]'' credits him only by his last name.

One of the first "and-as" credits was afforded [[Spencer Tracy]] (as Lieutenant Colonel [[James H. Doolittle]]) in the 1944 World War II film ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', since another top box office star of the time, [[Van Johnson]], had top billing and Tracy was too big a star to receive second billing. In all the posters and the screen credits, Tracy's name is displayed in larger letters than Johnson's.

Some films have both an "and-as" credit and a separate last billing credit, such as the [[Irwin Allen]] 1978 disaster film ''[[The Swarm (film)|The Swarm]]'', the opening credits of which, after listing an already large cast of stars, concludes with "[[Fred MacMurray]] as Clarence ... and [[Henry Fonda]]".

===Unbilled appearances===
An actor may go uncredited, and not be listed in either or both of the opening and closing credits. Reasons for this may vary. Some examples include:

* As [[Gary Oldman]] appeared under heavy make-up in ''[[Hannibal (movie)|Hannibal]]'', he requested that his name be completely removed from the billing and credits in order to "do it anonymously".&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/035/035937p1.html Interview with Gary Oldman] from [[IGN]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nathan Murray is still credited as "Mr. Oldman's assistant" and Oldman's name was added to the end credits upon the film's home video release.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}
* Even though [[Gene Hackman]] had a prominent role in ''[[The Firm (1993 film)]]'' he chose not to receive any billing credit because [[Tom Cruise]] was afforded sole, above the title, top billing with the letters of his name equal to that of the film title.
* For suspense purposes, [[Kevin Spacey]], in ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'', requested not to be credited in the opening titles or in any advertising for the film.&lt;ref&gt;''Seven'' [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114369/trivia?tr=tr0734334 Trivia] – [[IMDb]]&lt;/ref&gt; His name appears in the closing credits.
* In the opening of 1931's ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', the credit for "The Monster" is a question mark. [[Boris Karloff]] is named in the closing credits.
* [[Ashton Kutcher]] appears as the main antagonist, Hank, in the [[2003 in film|2003]] family comedy ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (2003 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' and is uncredited although he is one of the film's main characters.
* In the 1974 film ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'', [[Walter Matthau]] agreed to provide a cameo performance without compensation on the condition that he not be credited under his real name; he was credited under a fictitious name of his choosing, "Walter Matuschanskayasky."
* Because he played the part without pay, [[Bruce Willis]] is not credited for his prominent role in the portion of ''[[Four Rooms]]'' directed by [[Quentin Tarantino]].
* [[Owen Wilson]] does not receive credit for his "Jedidiah" character in ''[[Night at the Museum]]'', though he receives credit in the sequel, ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian|Battle of the Smithsonian]]''.
* [[John Wayne]] was billed as "Michael Morris" in two cameo television appearances directed by [[John Ford]], an episode of ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and an anthology installment called ''[[Flashing Spikes]]'' starring [[James Stewart]]. Wayne's real name was Marion Michael Morrison.
* For his cameo appearances in ''[[Cabin Boy]]'' and ''[[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]]'', [[David Letterman]] was billed as "Earl Hofert."
* In ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'', [[Matt Damon]]'s casting was kept secret during production, and he is not credited in the film. This was a deliberate decision by the director [[Christopher Nolan|Chris Nolan]], as he deliberately uses the audience's familiarity with Matt Damon as a 'good guy' actor to hide his character's true intentions.&lt;ref&gt;http://entertainment.inquirer.net/156463/chris-nolan-explains-why-he-kept-actors-casting-a-secret Interview with Chris Nolan&lt;/ref&gt;

Other unbilled roles feature famous actors or actresses who pop up in a movie as a face in a crowd, a man on a bench, or other 'background' characters, who are given screen time for a brief, but recognizable, moment, such as [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Bob Hope]] momentarily appearing in a circus audience during ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]''. They can be recognized, but sometimes are not credited for financial reasons – if they receive credit, they would be due payment commensurate with their fame.

===Screenwriters billing===
{{main|WGA screenwriting credit system}}
Writing credits for films and TV shows written under the jurisdiction of the [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA) uses the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]]. For writers who belong to the WGA, the writing credits affect reputation, union membership, and income. Under the rules, the film producer must first submit the proposed writing credits for the project to both the WGA and all the participating writers. If any participating writer objects to the proposed credits, it then enters arbitration, with the WGA being the final arbiter.

The WGA rules help dictate whether a screenplay should be classified as "original" or is instead based on another source. If based on another source, an additional "Based on a book/play/other source by" is generally required. In the case of a sequel to the film, the credited writers of the original motion picture may be entitled to a "Based on characters created by" credit.

The WGA's rules also outlines when credits can be apportioned separately for the story, and for the screenplay itself when all writers were not equally involved in the creation of both. When the same writers are entitled to both "Screenplay by" and "Story by" credit, they will instead by listed under one "Written by" credit.

For writing teams of two, they are credited as one, separated on the credits by an ampersand ("X &amp; Y"). If each works independently on the script (the most common system), they are separated by an "and". If more than two persons worked on the screenplay, the credits may read something like "screenplay by X &amp; Y and Z and W", where X and Y worked as a team, but Z and W worked separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/feature/1998/10/09feature.html|title=Glatzer (October 1998) "Movie credits 101"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WGA system also puts limits on the number of writers: on films, "Screenplay by," "Teleplay by," and "Written by" credit each can list no more than three writers (or writing teams).

===Director billing===
If the main credits occur at the beginning, then the director's name is last to be shown before the film's narrative starts, as a result of an agreement between the [[Directors Guild of America|DGA]] and motion picture producers in 1939. However, if all billing is shown at the end, his/her name will be displayed first, immediately followed by the writing credits.

* In 1980, [[George Lucas]] resigned from the Directors Guild of America after it insisted, against his wishes, that [[Irvin Kershner]], the director of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', be credited at the beginning of the film because the company name Lucasfilm was there; it had previously allowed the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), which had a similar opening sequence, to go unchallenged because the writer-director credit (George Lucas) matched the company name Lucasfilm Ltd.
* ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' is one of the few MGM films in which the director receives very prominent billing in the posters advertising the movie – the posters state "[[William Wyler]]'s Production of", although the same credit does not appear in the actual on-screen credits.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4Vqh-dOq04&amp;feature=related&lt;/ref&gt; A similar example is [[David Lean]], whose ''[[Doctor Zhivago (1965 film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'' and ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]'' both carry the credit "David Lean's Film of" (followed by the title). [[Stanley Kubrick]] received prominent title billing from ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964) onwards, and from ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (1971) he generally received main billing, with the actors only listed in the billing block. Advertising materials for Kubrick's ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'' featured the billing "[[Tom Cruise|CRUISE]] / [[Nicole Kidman|KIDMAN]] / KUBRICK."
* Filmmaker and playwright [[Tyler Perry]] always inserts his name into the title of each of his films and television shows. For instance: ''Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married?'' or ''Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns''. To date, the only film he has not done this with is ''[[For Colored Girls]]'', which is an adaptation of the [[Ntozake Shange]] play ''[[For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf]]''.{{citation needed|reason=Tyler Perry's For Colored Girls can easily be misread – this could be a factor |date=May 2012}}

==Billing block==
[[File:Attackofthe50ftwoman.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Reynold Brown]]'s poster for ''[[Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]'' (1958), with a billing block at the bottom. |alt=Poster art. A giant woman clad in a white bikini straddles an elevated, 4-lane highway. She has an angry expression, and she's holding one smoking car in her left hand as if it were a toy. She is reaching down to grab another. There are several car crashes on the highway, and people are fleeing from her as if they were small insects.]]
The "billing block" is the "list of names that adorn the bottom portion of the official poster (or '[[one sheet]]', as it is called in the movie industry) of the movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Movie Business: The Definitive Guide to the Legal and Financial Secrets of Getting Your Movie Made |first=Kelly |last=Crabb |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2005 |
isbn=9780743264921 |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w-wkvUwc2hYC&amp;pg=PA72}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the layout of [[film poster]]s and other film advertising copy, the billing block is usually set in a highly condensed [[typeface]] (one in which the height of characters is several times the width).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://posterwire.com/poster-credits-font/ |title=Credit Where Credit is Due |date=March 21, 2005 |publisher=Posterwire.com |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By convention, the [[point size]] of the billing block is 15 to 35 percent of the average height of each letter in the title logo. Typefaces used include [[Univers]] 39, Univers 49, and Bee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lettercult.com/archives/387 |title=Corey Holmes watches the Watchmen |last=Jaramillo |first=Brian |date=March 4, 2009 |work=Lettercult |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inclusion in the credits and the billing block is generally a matter of detailed contracts between Hollywood labor unions representing creative talent and the producer or film distributor. The labor union contracts specify minimum requirements for presenting actors, writers and directors.&lt;ref&gt;Marich, Robert (2013) Marketing To Moviegoers: Third Edition (2013), SIU Press, p. 18-20&lt;/ref&gt; But star talent is free to individually negotiate larger name presentations, such as when a star actor or director has his or her name above a movie’s title. The union contracts also cover billing blocks in trailers, outdoor billboards, TV commercials, newspaper advertising and online advertising. Using a condensed typeface allows the heights of the characters to meet contractual constraints while still allowing enough horizontal space to include all the required text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schott |first=Ben |title=Assembling the Billing Block |date=February 23, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/02/24/opinion/sunday/ben-schott-movies-billing-blocks.html?smid=pl-share |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bororo''' (Borôro), also known as '''Boe''', is the sole surviving language of a small family believed to be part of the [[Macro-Gê languages]].&lt;ref name=indiancultures&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indian-cultures.com/Cultures/bororo.html |title=Bororo Indians |accessdate=2007-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005815/http://indian-cultures.com/Cultures/bororo.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is spoken by the [[Bororo]], hunters and gatherers in the Central [[Mato Grosso]] region of [[Brazil]].

== Phonology ==
Bororo has a mid-sized phonemic inventory of seven vowels and fifteen consonants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ainore Boe egore: um estudo descritivo da língua bororo econseqüências para a teoria de caso e concordância.|last=Nonato|first=Rafael Bazerra|publisher=Instituto de Estudos de Linguagem|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=19-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orthographic representations, when they differ from IPA, are shown in angle brackets (all from Nonato 2008, based on [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist transcription]]).

=== Vowels ===
The vowel system of Bororo is somewhat cross-linguistically unusual in that it distinguishes [[roundedness]] only in its [[Back vowel|back vowels]] (although Crowell (1979) analyzes these as underlyingly central&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Bororo|last=Crowell|first=Thomas Harris|publisher=Cornell University|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

![[Low vowel|Low]]
| colspan="3" |a
|}The mid vowels /e ɤ o/ alternate with the open-mid (or "[[Tenseness|lax]]") vowels [ɛ ʌ ɔ] in apparent [[free variation]].

The unrounded back vowels /ɯ ɤ/ become central [ɨ ɘ] word-finally. Furthermore, [ɘ] (i.e. word-final /ɤ/) is not distinguished from, and often surfaces as, front [ɛ]. As a result, /ɤ/ and /e/ are at least partially merged word-finally.

==== Diphthongs and long vowels ====
Bororo has a rich inventory of twelve [[Diphthong|diphthongs]]:
{| class="wikitable"
|+
!
!'''-i'''
!-e
!-u
!-o
!-a
|-
|'''a-'''

|
|-
|'''ɤ-'''
|ɤi̯
|
|
|
|
|-
|'''ɯ-'''
|ɯi̯
|
|
|
|
|}
All pure vowels can also occur long, i.e. as /iː eː ɯː ɤː uː oː aː/. In contrast to other languages with phonemic [[vowel length]], however, these are quite rare, and there seems to be no reason to distinguish long vowels from same-vowel sequences.This is evidenced by the mandatory lengthening of monosyllables, where the vowel of a monosyllable is repeated to form a long vowel: for example, /ba/ "village" becomes /baa̯/ [baː].

=== Consonants ===
Unusually for a South American language, Bororo has no phonemic [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]].
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;" data-ve-attributes="{&amp;quot;style&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;text-align: center;&amp;quot;}"
!
![[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]

|}
The velar stop /k/ becomes [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] [kʰ] before nonback vowels /a e i/; the labiovelar approximant /w/ becomes labiodental [[Labiodental approximant|[ʋ]]] in the same environment. Plain and labialized velar stops /{{IPA|k}} g kʷ ɡʷ/ merge as labialized [kʷ ɡʷ] before rounded vowels /u o/. The voiced velar stop /g/ lenites to fricative [[Voiced velar fricative|[ɣ]]] between vowels.

=== Syllable structure and stress ===
The canonical syllable structure in Bororo is (C)V: that is, a mandatory vowel nucleus (or diphthong), optionally preceded by a single onset consonant. Aside from unmodified loanwords from Portuguese (which are quite common, and becoming more so), Bororo syllables never have onset consonant clusters or codas.

Stress in Bororo occurs generally (again with the exception of unmodified Portuguese loanwords) on the penultimate [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]. Since diphthongs contain two morae, this means that a diphthong in either penultimate or final position will generally be stressed: [ˈbai̯ɡa] "bow", [kaˈnao̯] "pimple, scale". Before compounding, however, diphthongs are reanalyzed as a monomoraic syllable, and stress is assigned again to the penultimate syllable of the whole compound: [keˈrakae̯] "finger", from /kera/ "hand" and /kae̯/ "digit".

=== Morphophonology ===
Bororo has a process of stem-initial [[Consonant mutation|mutation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The phonology of Boróro verb, postposition, and noun paradigms.|last=Crowell|first=Thomas Harris|publisher=Arquivos de Anatomia e Antropologia|year=1977|isbn=|location=Instituto de Antropologia Prof. Souza Marques, Rio de Janeiro|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a stem (whether a noun, verb, or preposition) beginning in a consonant takes on a prefix itself containing a consonant, the stem-initial consonant is voiced; for example, ''kodu'' "to go" becomes ''ikodu'' "I go" with the first person singular (prefix ''i-'') but ''pagodu'' "we go" in first person plural inclusive (prefix ''pa''-). In addition, /b/ becomes /w/ and /dʒ/ becomes /j/ when following a prefix, regardless of whether the latter has a consonant or not: ''bogai'' "for" becomes ''iwogai'' "for me". Stems beginning with /d g m n r j w/ do not undergo any change. This process is part of a wider [[Consonant harmony|harmony]] restriction in Bororo, rare among the world's languages: no word (excluding clitics and compounds) may contain more than one voiceless obstruent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Phonology Squib: Bororo stop voicing|last=Nonato|first=Rafael Bezerra|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, a stem beginning in a vowel requires the insertion of a "thematic" consonant to attach a prefix. The consonant used varies both by the prefix and the stem-initial vowel: the first-person singular, first-person plural exclusive, and third-person plural prefixes insert the thematic consonant -''t-/-d''- before stems beginning in ''a-'' or ''o-'', while all other combinations (i.e. other personal prefixes or stem-initial ''i-''; no native stems begin in ''e-'' or ''u-'') insert ''-k-/-g-.'' For example, whereas ''ore'' "children" becomes ''i-t-ore'' "my children", ''iwögü'' "steal" becomes ''i-k-iwögü'' "I steal". A few irregular stems which would be expected to take ''-t-/-d-'' instead take ''-n-'': ''oika'' "anxiety" becomes ''inoika'' "my anxiety", rather than ''*itoiga'' or similar. Finally, since vowel-initial stems never take a third-person singular prefix, no thematic vowel is inserted. This process is summarized in the table below.

== Morphology ==
Bororo, like most languages of South America, is [[Synthetic language|synthetic]] and [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] (albeit with some degree of fusion). However, it cannot strictly be labelled "[[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]]"; it does not make use of [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]] or any other means of particularly extensive [[Morphological derivation|derivation]]. Nominal morphology is fairly simple - on a level comparable with modern [[Romance languages]] - and verbal morphology, while somewhat more complex, cannot exceed three or four affixes on any given verb, in sharp contrast to the better-known "polysynthetic" languages of the Americas such as [[Classical Nahuatl grammar|Nahuatl]] or [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]].

Six basic word classes exist in Bororo: nouns and verbs (both open classes) and conjunctions, postpositions, adverbs, and pronouns (all closed).&lt;ref&gt;Nonato 2008, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Note that there is no independent class of adjectives; the functions of adjectives in European languages are filled by verbs or nouns in Bororo. This section provides an overview of Bororo morphology as organized by these classes.

=== Nouns ===
There is no category of obligatory nominal affixes in Bororo; a noun phrase may therefore be composed of a single unmarked root.

==== Plurality ====
Most nouns are pluralized by means of a plural suffix, whose most common allomorph is ''-doge'': ''arigao'' "dog" pluralizes to ''arigao-doge'' "dogs". The other allomorphs are ''-e'' (mainly following names of animals, e.g. ''juko-e'' "monkeys"), ''-mage'' (mainly following kinship terms, e.g. ''i-rago-mage'' "my grandchildren") and -''ge'' (mainly following pronouns, e.g. ''ema-ge'' "they"). In addition, there is a "zero morpheme" ''*bo-'' which can occur only with the plural suffix ''-e'', meaning "things" or "people", hence the Bororos' own term for themselves ''Boe.''

Some nouns, however, are basically plural and require a [[Singulative number|marked singular]] suffix ''-dü.'' These generally refer to human beings; examples include ''barae'' "white people" (''baraedü'' "a white person") and ''ime'' "men" (''imedü'' "a man").

==== Diminution and gender ====
[[Diminutive|Diminution]] is a productive process in Bororo. The diminutive suffix is -''rogu''; ''awagü'' "cobra" therefore may become ''awagü-rogu'' "little cobra" (Portuguese ''cobrinha''). This has the allomorph ''-kügüre'' when attached to a plural noun: ''awagoe'' "cobras" (an irregular plural) becomes ''awagoe-kügüre'' "little cobras".

Bororo has no obligatory marking of [[grammatical gender]]. Many distinctions made by noun gender in Portuguese and other languages with the category are simply made by [[Suppletion|suppletive]] forms in Bororo, as in ''marido /'' ''oredüje'' "husband / wife" (Portuguese ''esposo / esposa''), or by compounding with the nouns ''imedü'' "man" and ''aredü'' "woman" - hence ''tapira imedü'' "bull" and ''tapira aredü'' "cow" from ''tapira'' "cattle". However, there is also a feminine derivative suffix ''-do'', which is used with personal names and demonstratives: ''awü'' "this", ''awü-do'' "this (woman)".

==== Postpositions ====
Bororo uses postpositions rather than prepositions. Notably, these postpositions may be [[Inflected preposition|inflected]] with the same set of bound pronouns as verbs and inalienable possession; for example, ''ae'' "to, toward" can become ''et-ai'' "to them".

===== Focus =====
One postposition, ''ji'', is used to establish the nominal focus of a sentence - what Crowell (1979) refers to as "range or referent".&lt;ref&gt;Crowell 1979, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, this functions very similarly to focusing prepositions in English: ''e-mago-re tori '''ji''''', "they talked '''about''' the mountains". However, the range of [[Ambitransitive verb|ambitransitive verbs]] in Bororo is much narrower (if indeed ambitransitives exist at all) than in English, and so several verbs which are transitive in English require focusing with ''-ji'' in Bororo: ''imedü jorüdü-re karo '''ji''''' "the men ate the fish" (compare ''a-jorüdü-re'' "you ate"). These verbs - further examples of which are ''ra'' "sing", ''aidü'' "want", and ''rö'' "do" - function exactly as any other intransitive verb in Bororo.

===== Demonstratives =====
Bororo has three degrees of [[Deixis|deictic distance]]: near (''a-''), medium (''no-''), and distant (''ce-''). To modify a noun, these must precede the relative marker ''-wü'': '''''a-wü''' imedü'' "'''this''' man", '''''ce'''-wü imedü'' "'''that''' man (over there)". Since Bororo lacks [[Article (grammar)|articles]], these occasionally take their place, but not nearly as frequently as true articles are used in English or Portuguese.

==== Possession ====
Like many indigenous languages of South America, Bororo distinguishes [[Clusivity|inclusive and exclusive first-person plurals]] as well as [[Inalienable possession|alienable and inalienable possession]]. Inalienable possession is the only nominal category marked by prefixes; since these are identical with the pronominal prefixes of verbs, they are listed in the section "Pronouns". The table below provides a list of alienable possessors with the example word ''tori'', "stone":
{| class="wikitable"

|}

=== Verbs ===
Bororo verbal morphology is basically divided along lines of [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]]. Both transitive and intransitive verbs take the same set of bound pronouns to convey subjects and objects (e.g. '''''i'''-reru-re, '''a'''-reru-re'' "I danced, you danced" / '''''i'''-re '''a-'''reru-dö'' "I make you dance"), but each has an exclusive set of suffixes. "Intransitive" suffixes naturally apply to intransitive verbs, for which there is only one core argument - for example, the neutral aspect ''-re'' in ''i-reru-'''re''''' - but also to the [[Ergative case|agent of a transitive clause]], hence ''i-'''re''' a-reru-dö''; meanwhile, "transitive" suffixes can only be applied to the main verb of a transitive clause - e.g. the causative ''-dö'' in ''i-re a-reru-'''dö'''.'' For this reason, the suffixes listed in this section cannot properly be called "verbal" suffixes alone; they are grouped in this section merely for convenience.

==== Intransitive and ergative ====
As mentioned above, these morphemes are suffixed either to the verb of an intransitive clause or to the agent of a transitive clause (A).

===== Aspect =====
Bororo uses six suffixes, as well as a null suffix /-∅/, to convey [[grammatical aspect]]: three explicit grammatical aspects, divided into "direct" and "[[Indirect speech|indirect]]" marking. These are the only strictly mandatory affixes of any kind; they vary in frequency, but all are productive and fairly common. All of these seven options are mutually exclusive.

====== Neutral ======
The most common suffix in Bororo by far is the declarative or "neutral" ''-re.'' This suffix conveys a basic and unmarked tense, aspect, and mood for a declarative or interrogative sentence: ''kowaru kuri-'''re''''' "the horse is big", ''kaiba kodu-'''re''''' "where did he go?" Since it does not convey any tense information, it can be translated as either present or past in English: ''kowaru kuri-re'', for example, could be interpreted either as "the horse is big" or "the horse was big".

====== Stative ======
The stative suffix ''-nüre'' indicates that the action described by the verb is either ongoing or essential to the subject: ''et-ore e-ra-'''nüre''''' "the children were singing", ''imedü pega-'''nüre''''' "the man is (essentially) bad" (contrast with neutral ''imedü pega-'''re''''' "the man is bad").

====== Purpose / Hortative ======
The "purpose" suffix -''wö'' indicates that the action in question is the desired result of another (itself usually marked with neutral aspect). This usage always requires a nominalizer ''dü-'' and the postposition ''-bogai,'' "in order to": ''i-tu-re a-nudu-'''wö''' dü-bogai'' "I left so that you could sleep" (or "... in order for you to sleep").

This suffix is also used to indicate a [[hortative]] mood: ''pa-goage-'''wö''' karo-ji'' "let's eat the fish". This usage does not require another clause or the ''dü-bogai'' construction.

====== Recent ======
Recent aspect is not conveyed with a suffix ''per se'' but rather the absence of a suffix; that is, a sentence without an aspect suffix is to be understood as occurring in the present or the recent past. Sentences using the other aspect markers may also be understood as present or recent, but only the absence of a suffix conveys this explicitly: ''imedü maru-∅'' "the man is hunting".

====== Indirect ======
All three explicit aspect suffixes can also be rendered as indirect, meaning that the action they describe was itself described in speech or thought - corresponding broadly to the subjunctive in European languages. Verbs marked as indirect therefore always follow another verb (again usually in the neutral aspect): ''imedü ako-'''re''' awagü pega-'''ye''','' "the man said that the cobra was bad / mean". However, direct suffixes may also occur in this context; the indirect only adds an explicit layer of uncertainty or secondhand knowledge. For example, ''i-mearüdae-re a-mügü-'''ye''''' means "I thought you were there (but I didn't know)", whereas ''i-mearüdae-re a-mügü-'''re''''' would mean "I thought you were there (and so you were)".

There is no independent indirect affix. Instead, the three ordinary aspect suffixes change to apparently-related but historically obscure alternate forms when rendered as indirect. There is no indirect version of the recent aspect ''-∅''; its meaning appears to be covered by the neutral indirect ''-ye''. The direct and indirect aspectual suffixes are compared below.

| -''yüre''
|-
!Purpose
|''-wö''
| -''wöe''
|-
!Recent
|''-∅''
|N/A (''-ye'')
|}

===== Negative =====
The negative suffix ''-ka- / -ga''- simply negates a verb as in English, and may be followed by any aspect marker: ''a-reru-re'' "you danced" becomes ''a-reru-'''ka'''-re'' "you did not dance". This likewise forms a negative imperative without any special marking or fusion: ''a-reru-ka-ba'' "don't dance!"

===== Hypothetical =====
The hypothetical suffix ''-mödü-'' indicates that the action is assumed (whether by the speaker or indirectly), but not definitely stated, to have taken place: ''u-tu-'''mödü'''-ka-re'' "he '''probably''' did not go", ''u-tu-mödü-ye'' "(someone said that) he did not go". This fuses with the neutral suffix ''-re'' to form ''-möde'': ''u-tu-möde'' "he probably went".

===== Inchoative =====
The inchoative suffix ''-gödü'' indicates that an action is beginning or has begun: ''meri rekodü-'''gödü'''-re'' "the sun '''is beginning''' to set".

==== Transitive ====
These three suffixes apply only to verbs which carries the patient or object of a transitive clause (O).

===== Causative =====
The causative suffix ''-dö'' indicates that the subject of the verb causes the main object to perform an action, adding a level of [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]]: ''i-re a-tu-'''dö''''' "I made you go". Theoretically, this suffix could embed new verbs indefinitely: ''i-re a-dö u-dö e-tu-dö'' "I made you make him make them go", but as in English it is rare to use more than two degrees.

===== Inceptive =====
The inceptive suffix ''-gö'' never occurs independently; it is the result of fusion with the causative. As a result, it has both a strictly [[Inchoative aspect|inceptive]] meaning and a causative one, and therefore similarly adds a degree of valency. Several verbs which could be translated with single morphologically simple words in English are formed using this suffix: examples include ''rüdiwa-'''gö''''' "to teach", literally "to cause to begin to know" and ''pemega-'''gö''''' "to prepare", literally "to cause to begin to be ready / good".

===== Imminent =====
The imminent suffix ''-yagu'' indicates that an action is or was about to happen, or alternatively that it is only "nearly" accomplished: ''a-re a-tu-'''yagu''''' "you were about to go", ''e-re tü-'''yagu''' pu-reo-re'' "they are almost alike". This is technically a transitive sentence in Bororo, unlike in English; however, it is restricted entirely to coreferential arguments (i.e. the subject and object are identical).

=== Pronouns ===
Personal pronouns are divided into free and bound forms. Free forms are used to strongly mark a topic (marked by the "fronting" suffix ''-re:'' homophonous with but not identical to the declarative ''re-''): '''''imi'''-re i-tu-re'' "(as for me,) I'm going". They are also used in "verbless" sentences (for which see below): '''''ema'''-re-o'' "here it is / this is it". Bound forms, meanwhile, are used to mark verb subjects and objects, inalienable possession, and postpositional inflection. The full list of free and bound forms (but not alienable possessors, for which see "Possession" above) is shown in the table below.

# Crowell (1979) references a first-person singular bound form ''yo-'' occasionally, but does not provide any description of this form or its use; it may be a typographic error. Nonato (2008) does not record it.
# ''U-'' is used as the third-person bound pronoun as an agentive subject, as the subject of some irregular intransitive verbs (most commonly ''-tu-'' "to go") and as the inalienable possessor of some irregular nouns. Otherwise, third person singular is not marked.

== Syntax ==

=== Transitive and intransitive clauses ===
As seen above, a different set of suffixes applies to intransitive verbs and transitive subjects on the one hand, and verbs containing transitive objects on the other. It follows, therefore, that an intransitive clause must contain only a single verb of the former type (e.g. ''i-reru-re'' "you dance"), whereas a transitive clause must contain one of each. In the latter case, the "subject" word precedes the "object-verb": for example, '''''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''-re '''i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''-wiye'' "'''you&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' advised '''me&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''". The use of bound pronouns is required even if the sentence contains a full noun in either subject or object position: ''ime '''e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''-re areme '''e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''-wiye'', word-for-word "the men they&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-did the women them&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; advise" - "the men advise the women".&lt;ref&gt;Crowell 1979, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ambitransitive verbs are at least exceedingly rare in Bororo, however, and intransitives with postpositional focus are very common, the frequency of strictly "transitive" constructions is far fewer than that of English or Portuguese.

=== Yes-no questions ===
Yes-no questions ("did/do..." etc.) follow the same syntactical rules as declarative and imperative clauses in Bororo. Indeed, an interrogative clause may differ from a declarative one only by intonation: ''ature'' "you went", ''ature?'' "did you go?" However, a yes-no question may also be indicated explicitly by placing the clitic ''=na'' immediately after the questioned element: ''aturena?'' "did you go?" This clitic is mandatory after a question that contains only a single uninflected word, for example with pronouns: ''imina''? "me?"&lt;ref&gt;Crowell 1979, pp. 75-76&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informational ("wh-") questions ===
Bororo has six question words, all ending in the interrogative morpheme ''-ba'': ''kabo-ba'' "what", ''yogüdü-ba'' "who", ''kakodiwü-ba'' ’which', ''ino-ba'' ’how', ''kai-ba'' ’where' and ''kodi-ba'' 'why'. If the question element is modified in some way (e.g. by a preposition), the following modifier must itself be marked with ''-ba'': '''''kabo&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''-ba '''tabo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''-ba imedü maragodü-re'' "'''what&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' did the man work '''with&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''?"

As this example illustrates, Bororo makes use of [[wh-movement]]. An exception to this rule is ''pa'', an alternative form of ''kai-ba'' "where", which follows rather than precedes its subject: ''imedü pa?'' "where is the man?"

=== Copular clauses ===
Unlike in English, many well-formed Bororo clauses lack a verb entirely, in which case the first noun (the subject) takes the "intransitive-ergative" suffixes described above. These clauses usually correspond to those formed using the verb "to be" in English: '''''pöbö'''''-''re wöe'' "there is '''water''' here", '''''ema'''-re-o'' "here '''it''' is", etc. Crowell (1979) divides these clauses, which he calls "copulative", into "existential", "equative" and "identificational".&lt;ref&gt;Crowell 1979, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike clauses with verbs, these use free pronoun forms exclusively (with the exception of inalienable possession).

Existential clauses denote the existence of their subject, optionally qualified by time and place. These are formed simply by applying the relevant inflection to the noun phrase: ''karo-re'' "there are fish / fish exist", ''karo-re pöbö'' ''tada'' "there are fish in the water", etc. If the subject of these clauses is modified by possession, this is taken as a full possessive statement: ''i-ke-re'', "I have food" (lit. "my food is").

Equative clauses denote an identity between two noun phrases. These are formed by the juxtaposition of two noun phrases, only the first of which is inflected: ''imedü-re imi'', "I am a man". If these noun phrases are modified outside of inflection (e.g. are possessed by a full noun rather than a prefixed pronoun), they require the "complex equative" particle ''rema'' (singular) or ''remage'' (plural) to end the clause: ''Kadagare onaregedü-re Creusa rema'' "Creusa is Kadagare's child".

Identificational clauses are used to present an object within a particular space. These are formed identically to existential clauses, followed by the addition of one of a set of suffixes ''-o, -no,'' and ''-ce,'' which correspond directly to the deictic prefixes ''a''-, ''no-'' and ''ce-'': ''karo-re-o'' "here / this is a fish".

==Important examples==

===Fermat's Last Theorem===
{{main|Fermat's Last Theorem}}
In [[number theory]], [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] (sometimes called '''Fermat's conjecture''', especially in older texts) states that no three [[positive number|positive]] [[integer]]s ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' can satisfy the equation ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for any integer value of ''n'' greater than two.

This theorem was first conjectured by [[Pierre de Fermat]] in 1637 in the margin of a copy of ''[[Arithmetica]]'' where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Oystein|last=Ore|title=Number Theory and Its History|year=1988|origyear=1948|publisher=Dover|isbn=978-0-486-65620-5|pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|The first successful proof]] was released in 1994 by [[Andrew Wiles]], and formally published in 1995, after 358 years of effort by mathematicians. The unsolved problem stimulated the development of [[algebraic number theory]] in the 19th century and the proof of the [[modularity theorem]] in the 20th century. It is among the most notable theorems in the [[history of mathematics]] and prior to its proof it was in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for "most difficult mathematical problems".

===Four color theorem===
{{Main|Four color theorem}}
[[File:Map of United States vivid colors shown.png|thumb|A four-coloring of a map of the states of the United States (ignoring lakes).]]

In [[mathematics]], the [[four color theorem]], or the four color map theorem, states that, given any separation of a plane into [[wikt:contiguity|contiguous]] regions, producing a figure called a ''map'', no more than four colors are required to color the regions of the map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color. Two regions are called ''adjacent'' if they share a common boundary that is not a corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Formal Proof—The Four-Color Theorem |author=Georges Gonthier |journal=Notices of the AMS |volume=55 |issue=11 |date=December 2008 |pages=1382–1393}}From this paper: Definitions: A planar map is a set of pairwise disjoint subsets of the plane, called regions. A simple map is one whose regions are connected open sets. Two regions of a map are adjacent if their respective closures have a common point that is not a corner of the map. A point is a corner of a map if and only if it belongs to the closures of at least three regions. Theorem: The regions of any simple planar map can be colored with only four colors, in such a way that any two adjacent regions have different colors.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the map of the United States of America, Utah and Arizona are adjacent, but Utah and New Mexico, which only share a [[Four Corners Monument|point]] that also belongs to Arizona and Colorado, are not.

[[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]] mentioned the problem in his lectures as early as 1840.&lt;ref name="rouse_ball_1960"&gt;[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] (1960) ''The Four Color Theorem'', in Mathematical Recreations and Essays, Macmillan, New York, pp 222-232.&lt;/ref&gt; The conjecture was first proposed on October 23, 1852&lt;ref name=MacKenzie&gt;Donald MacKenzie, ''Mechanizing Proof: Computing, Risk, and Trust'' (MIT Press, 2004) p103&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Francis Guthrie]], while trying to color the map of counties of England, noticed that only four different colors were needed. The [[five color theorem]], which has a short elementary proof, states that five colors suffice to color a map and was proven in the late 19th century {{Harv|Heawood|1890}}; however, proving that four colors suffice turned out to be significantly harder. A number of false proofs and false [[counterexample]]s have appeared since the first statement of the four color theorem in 1852.

The four color theorem was proven in 1976 by [[Kenneth Appel]] and [[Wolfgang Haken]]. It was the first major [[theorem]] to be [[computer-assisted proof#List of theorems proved with the help of computer programs|proved using a computer]]. Appel and Haken's approach started by showing that there is a particular set of 1,936 maps, each of which cannot be part of a smallest-sized counterexample to the four color theorem. (If they did appear, you could make a smaller counter-example.) Appel and Haken used a special-purpose computer program to confirm that each of these maps had this property. Additionally, any map that could potentially be a counterexample must have a portion that looks like one of these 1,936 maps. Showing this required hundreds of pages of hand analysis, Appel and Haken concluded that no smallest counterexamples exists because any must contain, yet do not contain, one of these 1,936 maps. This contradiction means there are no counterexamples at all and that the theorem is therefore true. Initially, their proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the [[computer-assisted proof]] was infeasible for a human to check by hand {{Harv|Swart|1980}}. Since then the proof has gained wider acceptance, although doubts remain {{Harv|Wilson|2002|loc=216–222}}.

===Hauptvermutung===
{{main|Hauptvermutung}}

The [[Hauptvermutung]] (German for main conjecture) of [[geometric topology]] is the conjecture that any two [[Triangulation (topology)|triangulations]] of a [[triangulable space]] have a common refinement, a single triangulation that is a subdivision of both of them. It was originally formulated in 1908, by [[Ernst Steinitz|Steinitz]] and [[Heinrich Franz Friedrich Tietze|Tietze]].

This conjecture is now known to be false. The non-manifold version was disproved by [[John Milnor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=John W.|last= Milnor |title=Two complexes which are homeomorphic but combinatorially distinct|journal= [[Annals of Mathematics]]|volume=74|year=1961|issue= 2 |pages=575&amp;ndash;590|mr=133127|doi=10.2307/1970299|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt; |jstor=1970299}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1961 using [[Analytic torsion|Reidemeister torsion]].

The [[manifold]] version is true in [[dimension]]s {{nowrap|1=''m'' ≤ 3}}. The cases {{nowrap|1=''m'' = 2 and 3}} were proved by [[Tibor Radó]] and [[Edwin E. Moise]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Moise | first = Edwin E. | title = Geometric Topology in Dimensions 2 and 3 | publisher = New York : Springer-Verlag | location = New York | year = 1977 | isbn = 978-0-387-90220-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1920s and 1950s, respectively.

===Weil conjectures===
{{main|Weil conjectures}}
In [[mathematics]], the [[Weil conjectures]] were some highly influential proposals  by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=André Weil|first=André |last=Weil|year=1949}} on the [[generating function]]s (known as [[local zeta-function]]s) derived from counting the number of points on [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] over [[finite field]]s.

A variety ''V'' over a finite field with ''q'' elements has a finite number of [[rational point]]s, as well as points over every finite field with ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; elements containing that field. The generating function has coefficients derived from the numbers ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of points over the (essentially unique) field with ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; elements.

Weil conjectured that such ''zeta-functions'' should be [[rational function]]s, should satisfy a form of [[functional equation]], and should have their zeroes in restricted places. The last two parts were quite consciously modeled on the [[Riemann zeta function]] and [[Riemann hypothesis]]. The rationality was proved by {{harvtxt|Dwork|1960}}, the functional equation by {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1965}}, and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was  proved by {{harvtxt|Deligne|1974}}

===Poincaré conjecture===
{{main|Poincaré conjecture}}
In [[mathematics]], the [[Poincaré conjecture]] is a [[theorem]] about the [[Characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] of the [[3-sphere]], which is the hypersphere that bounds the [[unit ball]] in four-dimensional space. The conjecture states: {{quote|Every [[simply connected]], [[closed manifold|closed]] 3-[[manifold]] is [[homeomorphic]] to the 3-sphere.}} An equivalent form of the conjecture involves a coarser form of equivalence than homeomorphism called [[homotopy equivalence]]: if a 3-manifold is ''homotopy equivalent'' to the 3-sphere, then it is necessarily ''homeomorphic'' to it.

Originally conjectured by [[Henri Poincaré]], the theorem concerns a space that locally looks like ordinary three-dimensional space but is connected, finite in size, and lacks any boundary (a [[Closed manifold|closed]] [[3-manifold]]).  The Poincaré conjecture claims that if such a space has the additional property that each [[path (topology)|loop]] in the space can be continuously tightened to a point, then it is necessarily a three-dimensional sphere.  An [[generalized Poincaré conjecture|analogous result]] has been known in higher dimensions for some time.

After nearly a century of effort by mathematicians, [[Grigori Perelman]] presented a proof of the conjecture in three papers made available in 2002 and 2003 on [[arXiv]]. The proof followed on from the program of [[Richard S. Hamilton]] to use the [[Ricci flow]] to attempt to solve the problem. Hamilton later introduced a modification of the standard Ricci flow, called ''Ricci flow with surgery'' to systematically excise singular regions as they develop, in a controlled way, but was unable to prove this method "converged" in three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hamilton | first = Richard S. | authorlink = Richard S. Hamilton | title = Four-manifolds with positive isotropic curvature | journal = Communications in Analysis and Geometry | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;92 | year = 1997 | doi =  10.4310/CAG.1997.v5.n1.a1| mr = 1456308 | zbl = 0892.53018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perelman completed this portion of the proof.  Several teams of mathematicians have verified that Perelman's proof is correct.

The Poincaré conjecture, before being proven, was one of the most important open questions in [[topology]].

===Riemann hypothesis===
{{main|Riemann hypothesis}}
In mathematics, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], proposed by {{harvs|txt|first=Bernhard|last= Riemann|year=1859|author-link=Bernhard Riemann}}, is a conjecture that the non-trivial [[root of a function|zeros]] of the [[Riemann zeta function]] all have [[real part]] 1/2.  The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the [[Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields]].

The Riemann hypothesis implies results about the distribution of [[prime numbers]]. Along with suitable generalizations, some mathematicians consider it the most important unresolved problem in [[pure mathematics]] {{harv|Bombieri|2000}}. The Riemann hypothesis, along with the [[Goldbach conjecture]], is part of [[Hilbert's eighth problem]] in [[David Hilbert]]'s list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 unsolved problems]]; it is also one of the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] [[Millennium Prize Problems]].

===P versus NP problem===
{{main|P versus NP problem}}
The [[P versus NP problem]] is a major [[List of unsolved problems in computer science|unsolved problem in computer science]].  Informally, it asks whether every  problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer; it is widely conjectured that the answer is no.  It was essentially first mentioned in a 1956 letter written by [[Kurt Gödel]] to [[John von Neumann]].  Gödel asked whether a certain NP complete problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time.&lt;ref&gt;Juris Hartmanis 1989, [http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/6910/1/89-994.pdf Gödel, von Neumann, and the P = NP problem], Bulletin of the
European Association for Theoretical Computer Science, vol. 38, pp. 101–107&lt;/ref&gt; The precise statement of the P=NP problem was introduced in 1971 by [[Stephen Cook]] in his seminal paper "The complexity of theorem proving procedures"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cook|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Cook|year=1971|chapter=The complexity of theorem proving procedures|chapterurl=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=805047|title=Proceedings of the Third Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing|pages=151–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered by many to be the most important open problem in the field.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lance Fortnow]], [http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/papers/pnp-cacm.pdf ''The status of the '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem''], Communications of the ACM 52 (2009), no.&amp;nbsp;9, pp.&amp;nbsp;78–86. {{doi|10.1145/1562164.1562186}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]] selected by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] to carry a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.

===Other conjectures===

* The [[twin prime conjecture]]
* The [[Collatz conjecture]]
* The [[Manin conjecture]]
* The [[Maldacena conjecture]]
* The [[Euler's sum of powers conjecture|Euler conjecture]], proposed by Euler in the 18th century but for which counterexamples for a number of exponents starting with n=4 were found beginning in the mid 20th century
* The [[Second Hardy–Littlewood conjecture|Hardy-Littlewood conjectures]] are a pair of conjectures concerning the distribution of prime numbers, the first of which expands upon the twin prime conjecture mentioned above.  Neither one has either been proven or disproven, but it ''has'' been proven that both cannot simultaneously be true.  At least one must be false.  It has not been proven which one is false, but it is widely believed that the first conjecture is true and the second one is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Ian | last=Richards | title=On the Incompatibility of Two Conjectures Concerning Primes | journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. | volume=80 | pages=419–438 | year=1974 | doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1974-13434-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Langlands program]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Langlands|first=Robert|title=Letter to Prof. Weil|year=1967|url=http://publications.ias.edu/rpl/section/21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a far-reaching web of these ideas  of '[[unifying conjecture]]s' that link different subfields of mathematics, e.g. [[number theory]] and [[representation theory]] of [[Lie group]]s; some of these conjectures have since been proved.

==Resolution of conjectures==

===Proof===
Formal mathematics is based on ''provable'' truth. In mathematics, any number of cases supporting a conjecture, no matter how large, is insufficient for establishing the conjecture's veracity, since a single [[counterexample]] would immediately bring down the conjecture. Mathematical journals sometimes publish the minor results of research teams having extended the search for a counterexample farther than previously done.  For instance, the [[Collatz conjecture]], which concerns whether or not certain [[sequence]]s of [[integer]]s terminate, has been tested for all integers up to 1.2 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (over a trillion). However, the failure to find a counterexample after extensive search does not constitute a proof that no counterexample exists nor that the conjecture is true, because the conjecture might be false but with a very large minimal counterexample.

Instead, a conjecture is considered proven only when it has been shown that it is logically impossible for it to be false. There are various methods of doing so; see [[Mathematical proof#Methods]] for details.

One method of proof, usable when there are only a finite number of cases that could lead to counterexamples, is known as "brute force": in this approach, all possible cases are considered and shown not to give counterexamples. Sometimes the number of cases is quite large, in which situation a brute-force proof may require as a practical matter the use of a computer algorithm to check all the cases: the validity of the 1976 and 1997 brute-force proofs of the [[four color theorem]] by computer was initially doubted, but was eventually confirmed in 2005 by [[theorem-proving]] software.

When a conjecture has been [[mathematical proof|proven]], it is no longer a conjecture but a [[theorem]]. Many important theorems were once conjectures, such as the [[Geometrization conjecture|Geometrization theorem]] (which resolved the [[Poincaré conjecture]]), [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and others.

===Disproof===
Conjectures disproven through counterexample are sometimes referred to as ''false conjectures'' (cf. the [[Pólya conjecture]] and [[Euler's sum of powers conjecture]]). In the case of the latter, the first counterexample found for the n=4 case involved numbers in the millions, although subsequently it has been found that the minimal counterexample is smaller than that.

===Undecidable conjectures===
Not every conjecture ends up being proven true or false. The [[continuum hypothesis]], which tries to ascertain the relative [[cardinal number|cardinality]] of certain [[infinite set]]s, was eventually shown to be [[Independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] (or independent) from the generally accepted set of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms|axioms of set theory]]. It is therefore possible to adopt this statement, or its negation, as a new [[axiom]] in a consistent manner (much as we can take [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]] as either true or false).

In this case, if a proof uses this statement, researchers will often look for a new proof that ''doesn't'' require the hypothesis (in the same way that it is desirable that statements in [[Euclidean geometry]] be proved using only the axioms of neutral geometry, i.e. no parallel postulate.) The one major exception to this in practice is the [[axiom of choice]]—unless studying this axiom in particular, the majority of researchers do not usually worry whether a result requires the axiom of choice.

==Conditional proofs==
Sometimes a conjecture is called a ''hypothesis'' when it is used frequently and repeatedly as an assumption in proofs of other results. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is a conjecture from [[number theory]] that (amongst other things) makes predictions about the distribution of [[prime number]]s. Few number theorists doubt that the Riemann hypothesis is true. In anticipation of its eventual proof, some have proceeded to develop further proofs which are contingent on the truth of this conjecture. These are called ''[[conditional proof]]s'': the conjectures assumed appear in the hypotheses of the theorem, for the time being.

These "proofs", however, would fall apart if it turned out that the hypothesis was false, so there is considerable interest in verifying the truth or falsity of conjectures of this type.

==In other sciences==
[[Karl Popper]] pioneered the use of the term "conjecture" in [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|title=Conjectures and refutations : the growth of scientific knowledge|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-28594-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conjecture is related to [[hypothesis]], which in [[science]] refers to a testable conjecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2733">In the [[philosophy of language]], the '''context principle''' is a form of [[semantic holism]]{{cn|date=April 2013}} holding that a philosopher should "never ... ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, but only in the context of a proposition" (Frege [1884/1980] x). 

==Analysis&lt;!--'Compositionalism' and 'Semantic contextualism' redirect here--&gt;==
The context principle is one of [[Gottlob Frege]]'s "three fundamental principles" for philosophical analysis, first discussed in his Introduction to ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'' (''Grundlagen der Arithmetik'', 1884). Frege argued that many philosophical errors, especially those related to [[psychologism]] in the [[philosophy of logic]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]], could be avoided by adhering carefully to the context principle. The view of meaning expressed by the context principle is sometimes called '''semantic contextualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;. This view need not be contrasted with the view that the meanings of words or expressions can (or must) be determined prior to, and independently of, the meanings of the propositions in which they occur, which is often referred to as '''compositionalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.

The context principle also figures prominently in the work of other [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic philosophers]], such as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who were greatly influenced by Frege's work.

== Formulations of the context principle ==
=== Gottlob Frege, Introduction to ''The Foundations of Arithmetic'' (1884/1980) ===

: In the enquiry that follows, I have kept to three fundamental principles:
:: always to separate sharply the psychological from the logical, the subjective from the objective;
:: never to ask for the meaning of a word in isolation, but only in the context of a proposition
:: never to lose sight of the distinction between concept and object.

=== Ludwig Wittgenstein, ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus'' (1921/1922) ===

: '''3.3''' Only the proposition has sense; only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning. ...
: '''3.314''' An expression has meaning only in a proposition. Every variable can be conceived as a [[propositional variable]].
: (Including the variable name.)

The '''debate on [[traditional Chinese characters]] and [[simplified Chinese characters]]''' is an ongoing dispute concerning Chinese orthography among users of Chinese characters. It has stirred up heated responses from supporters of both sides in [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Taiwan]], and among [[overseas Chinese]] communities with its implications of political ideology and cultural identity.&lt;ref name="Keller"&gt;Keller, Andrée Tabouret. (1997). Vernacular Literacy: A Re-Evaluation. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-823635-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simplified characters here exclusively refer to those characters simplified by the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), instead of the concept of character simplification as a whole. The effect of simplified characters on the language remains controversial for decades after their introduction.

==Problems==
The sheer difficulties posed by having two concurrent writing systems hinders communications between mainland China and other regions, although with exposure and experience a person educated in one system can quickly become familiar with the other system.&lt;ref name="rfd"/&gt; For those who know both systems well, converting an entire document written using simplified characters to traditional characters, or vice versa, is a trivial but laborious task. Automated conversion, however, from simplified to traditional is not straightforward because there is not always a one-to-one mapping of a simplified character to a traditional character. One simplified character may equate to many traditional characters. As a result, a computer can be used for the bulk of the conversion but will still need final checking by a human.&lt;ref name="rfd"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/chinese-language-ever-evolving/|title=The Chinese Language, Ever Evolving|first=Eileen|last=Chao|first2=Eugene|last2=Wang|first3=Meng|last3=Hsuan|first4=Norman|last4=Matloff|work=Room for Debate|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer [[Ba Jin]], in his essay "Thoughts: Reform of Chinese characters" ({{zh|s=随想录·汉字改革|t=隨想錄漢字改革|p=Suí xiǎng lù hànzì gǎigé}}), urged caution in any reforms to the written Chinese language. He cited the inability of those educated in Hong Kong or Taiwan to read material published on the mainland, and vice versa, as a great disadvantage of simplified Chinese. He also cited the ability to communicate, not just with Chinese peoples of various regions, but also with people from across the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] — countries such as [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]] — as a great advantage of the written Chinese language that should not be undermined by excessive simplification.&lt;ref&gt;Ba Jin. (1999) "随想录·汉字改革".《汉字文化》.Issue 4, 1999. Beijing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

===Pro simplified characters===
Proponents say that the Chinese writing system has been changing for millennia: it passed through the [[Oracle Script]], [[Bronzeware Script]], [[Seal Script]] and [[Clerical Script]] stages. Moreover, the majority of simplified characters are drawn from conventional abbreviated forms that have been used in handwriting for centuries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=S. Robert|title=The Languages of China|year=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-01468-5|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the use of 礼 instead of 禮,&lt;ref name="Norman_p81"&gt;{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Jerry|authorlink=Jerry Norman (sinologist)|title=Chinese|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1988|page=81|isbn=978-0-521-29653-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some simplified characters are in fact restorations of ancient forms that had become more complicated over time. For instance, the character for "cloud" was originally 云, but the character was borrowed to write a [[homophone|homophonous]] word meaning "to say". To disambiguate the two uses of the character, the "rain" radical ([[Radical 173|雨]]) was added on top when it meant "cloud", forming the current traditional character 雲. The homophonous word meaning "to say", however, has become archaic in modern Chinese, though 雲 continues to be used for "cloud". The simplified version simply restores 云 to its original use as "cloud".&lt;ref name="Norman_p81" /&gt;

===Pro traditional characters===
While some simplified characters were adopted from conventional abbreviated forms that have existed for a long time, those advocating the simplified forms often fail to point out that many such characters in fact had multiple vernacular forms out of which just one was chosen, arbitrarily, and then privileged by the designers of the simplified character scheme. Many of the changes have been found to be ideological, such as the removal of the "heart" (心) from the word "love" (愛) into the new character (爱) without heart. To some, the new 'heartless' love character is an attack on [[Confucianism]], which emphasizes the virtues of [[filial piety]] and humanity in relationships so as to maintain a harmonious society.&lt;ref name="Karlgren_1205"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karlgren|first=Bernhard|title=Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino-Japanese|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc., New York, 1974. Originally published in 1923|year=1974|page=1205}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, supporters of simplification claim that the use of the character 愛 to represent the meaning of "love" is a rather new invention and was not recorded in the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' (of course, still far more ancient than many of the modern simplified character innovations), implying a Han dynasty or later date for the creation of the modern traditional form. According to Duan Yucai's authoritative commentary of the ''Shuowen Jiezi'', which compiled philological information on Chinese characters and traced their origins, the character first used to write the word was 㤅, which was later supplanted by 愛.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdic.net/z/1e/sw/7231.htm |title=说文解字爱的解释 |publisher=Zdic.net |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- This is a bad argument, since 㤅 still has the heart radical in it.  I recommend removal of this argument.  --&gt; Supporters of simplification argue that the removal of the heart radical occurred in the context of calligraphy in ancient times and was not viewed in an anti-Confucian light.  A variant form without the heart radical appears in the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'' under the head character 愛.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdic.net/z/1e/kx/7231.htm|title=康熙字典爱的解释-康熙字典爱的意思-汉典"爱"字的康熙字典|first=|last=ZDIC.NET|website=Zdic.net|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the simplified form 爱 is well-attested in the [[semi-cursive script]] calligraphy from imperial times, appearing in the work of Sui dynasty calligrapher Zhi Guo (智果) and [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]] and has appeared in calligraphic works from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.com/cul/2012/09-10/4172373.shtml|title=现行简体字不少古代已有 "國"的简体字多达44种-中新网|first=|last=chinanews|website=Chinanews.com|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.360doc.com/content/14/0107/11/1520294_343270382.shtml|title=汉字简化后，親不见，愛无心|website=360doc.com|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-traditional commentators argue that the changes through the history are almost exclusively alterations in writing styles, especially vernacular writing, and not in the fundamental structure of the characters—especially after the [[Qin Shi Huang|Qin standardization]]. They have alleged that simplified characters were arbitrarily schematized and then imposed by the PRC on its people with the intention of subverting and eradicating selected elements of traditional Chinese culture, in order to carry out what the PRC viewed as necessary revolutionary modernization. These critics point out that many of the fundamental characteristics underlying Chinese characters, including [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] as well as etymological and phonetic elements, were deliberately omitted in their simplified form at least partly for this reason (i.e. disrupting continuity with traditional Chinese culture). One frequently-cited example is the character for "sage" or "holy", 圣 in simplified and 聖 in traditional. The simplified character lacks the ''king'' radical ([[Radical 96|王]]), replacing it with ''soil'' ([[Radical 32|土]]). Supporters of simplification appeal to the fact that that 圣 was often used, in handwriting, as a simplified variant of 聖 long before the PRC itself came into being.&lt;ref name="Karlgren_1205" /&gt;  The ''Shuowen Jiezi'' furthermore classifies 聖 as a ''xingsheng'' character with phonetic component 呈.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zdic.net/z/21/sw/8056.htm|title=Shuowen Jiezi "聖"|last=|first=|date=|website=Zdic.net|access-date=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the origin of the character may have nothing to do with any cultural connection to kings or royalty.

Even among supporters of simplification, some make the argument that Classical Chinese texts should not be printed in simplified Chinese because of the complexities involved in the use of ''tongjia'' (通假) or phonetic loan characters.  Ancient texts for instance might use the character 女 (''nǚ'', "women") when the character 汝 (''rǔ'', "thou") is intended semantically because of their similar pronunciation in [[Old Chinese]].  The character 汝 came into use relatively late.&lt;ref&gt;Ironically, 汝 itself is also a phonetic loan, the original meaning being the proper name of a river.&lt;/ref&gt;  The interpretation of ancient texts in often complicated by the presence of these phonetic loans, for which several very different meanings could be read.  Generally, the more ancient the text, the more numerous the phonetic loans, since separate characters were slowly introduced as the written language evolved, in order to disambiguate these loans.  The merging of several traditional characters into one simplified character (e.g., 願 (''yuàn'', "desire", commonly used) and 愿 (''yuàn'', "honest", archaic and rare) to 愿 (both meanings)) during simplification can be thought of as a modern introduction of phonetic loans that complicates an already complex landscape of ''tongjia'' characters appearing in classical texts, introducing the possibility of misinterpretation or errors in transmission or transcription.  Personal names of historical individuals are especially problematic.  For example, there are two [[Six Dynasties]] period generals whose names are 王濬 (206-286) and 王浚 (252-314), both of which are pronounced as ''Wáng Jùn''.  However, according to the current PRC simplification scheme, the character 濬 is considered to be an obsolete variant of 浚, so to conform to standard orthography, these names should be written identically using 浚.  Against this, proponents of simplified characters respond that it is uneconomical to introduce high school students, already burdened by schoolwork, to a new character set for the sole purpose of teaching the classical language.  Moreover, history and language majors in colleges and universities can gradually learn to read texts set in traditional characters, as the need arises.  Nevertheless, classical texts set in traditional Chinese can be hard to find in mainland Chinese bookstores.  The Zhonghua Publishing House (''Zhonghua Shuju'', 中華書局) and a couple of specialist scholastic publishers are the only publishers to routinely publish works in traditional characters.

==Literacy==

===Arguments for simplified characters===
*Proponents feel that simplified characters with fewer strokes make learning easier.&lt;ref name="Gunde, Richard 2002"&gt;Gunde, Richard. (2002).  Culture and Customs of China. Greenwood Press.  {{ISBN|0-313-30876-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Literacy rates have risen steadily in rural and urban areas since the simplification of the Chinese characters, while this trend was hardly seen during 30 years of [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) rule and 250 years of [[Qing Dynasty|Manchurian rule]] before them, when the traditional writing system was dominant, though this rise in literacy may not necessarily be due to simplification alone.
*Although Taiwan, which uses traditional Chinese characters, has a better literacy rate, proponents point out that with a population 50 times larger and landmass 260 times bigger, the illiteracy in mainland China is much more difficult to eradicate. 
*Many studies have been conducted to prove, contrary to cultural prejudice, that simplified characters are easier to learn than traditional ones.&lt;ref name="Hodge&amp;Louie"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Politics of Chinese Language and Culture: The Art of Reading Dragons|first=Robert|last=Hodge|first2=Kam|last2=Louie|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|pages=62–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments for traditional characters===
*The literacy rate of Taiwan and Hong Kong is higher than that of mainland China, compared for the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theme.taipei.gov.tw/cgi-bin/SM_theme?page=424aab17 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714132234/http://theme.taipei.gov.tw/cgi-bin/SM_theme?page=424aab17 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-14 |title=演講紀錄 |publisher=Theme.taipei.gov.tw |date=2005-03-31 |accessdate=2014-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fact that mainland China is much larger and more populous than Taiwan does not excuse a lower rate of literacy, as by definition a literacy [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] represents the [[Fraction (mathematics)|proportion]] of literate people—not the sheer [[quantity]] of literate persons living in the country's territory.
*Even if it is possible to correlate the adoption of simplified Chinese characters with increases in literacy rates, given the consistently high literacy rates in Taiwan and Hong Kong, not to mention the fact that [[correlation does not imply causation]], such correlations do not prove that the simplification of characters alone is determinant of literacy success any more than the many other factors involved in cultural change and educational reform.&lt;ref name=Macaraeg&gt;{{Citation|last=Macaraeg|first=Ruel A.|title=The "Success" of Chinese Script Reform: A Critique of Assessment Methodology in China's Character Simplification Program|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Aldrich | first=John | journal=Statistical Science | volume=10 | number=4 | year=1995 | pages=364–376 | title=Correlations Genuine and Spurious in Pearson and Yule | jstor=2246135 | doi=10.1214/ss/1177009870}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aside from correlational arguments the only other form of evidence offered in support of script reform success through character simplification is [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]].&lt;ref name=Macaraeg/&gt;
*The [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] of statistics about literacy rates in mainland China is questionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Literacy and Development: Ethnographic Perspectives|last= Street|first=Brian V.|author2=Regie Stites|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-23451-1|pages=171–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, even assuming that the mainland statistics are valid, they still fail to match the overall consistently high rates of literacy in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

==Ambiguity==
{{Main|Ambiguities in Chinese character simplification}}

===Clarity of simplified characters===
*Proponents feel that some traditional characters are too similar in appearance, such as 書 (''shū'') "book", 晝 (''zhòu'') "daytime" and 畫 (''huà'') "drawing": the simplified forms are 书, {{lang|zh-cn|昼}}, and {{lang|zh-cn|画}}, which look much more distinct.
*[[Classical Chinese]] mainly used one character to form one word, which made it very common that one character had multiple meanings and multiple pronunciation: "天" means "sky" (天苍苍), "heaven" (天将降大任), "nature" (浑然天成), "weather" (心忧炭贱愿天寒); "长" means "length" (''cháng'', 长一身有半), "specialty" (''cháng'', 一技之长), "grow" (''zhǎng'', 草木遂长), "senior" (''zhǎng'', 以君为长者), etc. Context is vital to determining the meaning of a certain character in Classical Chinese. After the early 1900s' [[Vernacular Chinese]] movement, words were mainly formed by multiple characters (mostly two), and today one word usually has only one meaning: "天空" means "sky", "上天" means "heaven", "天然" means "nature", "天气" means "weather", "长度" means "length", "生长" means "grow", etc. Context is not necessary to determine the meaning of a certain word. Merging characters with few meanings in identical or similar pronunciation, actually does not make reading more difficult when using Vernacular Chinese: "头发" (頭髮, ''fà'') means "hair", "出发" (出發, ''fā'') means "set off", "谷物" (穀物, ''gǔ'') means "grain", "山谷" (''gǔ'') means "hollow". Instead, simplification simply reduces the number of characters one would need to learn for modern life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xys.org/fang/doc/history/jianhua2.txt|format=TXT |title=简体字引起混乱吗？ |author=方舟子 |website=Xys.org |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clarity of traditional characters===
*Opponents cite a similar claim: simplifications make distinct characters more similar to each other in appearance, giving the "shape recognition" mechanism of the reading part of the brain ambiguous clues. An example is 無 (''wú'') "none", simplified into {{lang|zh-cn|无}}, which looks very similar to the existing character 天 (''tiān'') "sky". Also, 設 (''shè'') "designate", and 沒 (''méi'') "without", are quite similar in their simplified forms 设 and {{lang|zh-cn|没}} and can result in confusion in rapid handwriting (Another example of the same kind is 活 (''huó'') "to live" and 話 (''huà'') "talk," which in simplified are 活 and 话 and can be misinterpreted in rapid handwriting). Similarly, some simplified characters create more confusion. In traditional writing, 千 (''qiān'') "thousand", and 乾 (''gān'') "dry" are very different characters. In simplified writing, the same characters appear to be almost identical, being 千 and 干, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Varadi |first=Joe |title=Simplified Chinese? |url=http://www.geocities.com/mangalica/simplified.html |accessdate=2 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ko2rQxXb?url=http://www.geocities.com/mangalica/simplified.html |archivedate=October 26, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Simplified Chinese characters frequently include merged characters, which opponents view as baseless and arbitrary: 後 (''hòu'', "behind") and 后 (''hòu'', "queen") are both simplified into 后. Likewise, 隻 (''zhī'', a [[Chinese classifier|measure word]]) and 只 (''zhǐ'', "only") are merged into 只; 發 (''fā'', "happening") and 髮 (''fà'', "hair") are merged into 发; 麵 (''miàn'', noodles/flour) and 面 (''miàn'', face/side/surface) are merged into 面; 穀 (''gǔ'', "crop") and 谷 (gǔ, "valley") are merged into 谷, and so on.
*On 3 September 1993, the Board of Language Usage &amp; Applications of China permitted and re-introduced the usage of the character ‘鎔’ and released a new policy of ''Resolution for the Complication in Using Character ‘鎔’ and Its Usage Re-introduction'' (《关于"鎔"字使用问题的批复》).  The movement was an attempt in trying to resolve the controversy caused by the conflict between the lawful mergers of characters of ‘鎔’and ‘熔’ and the name usage of former Vice Premier [[Zhu Rongji]]. According to earlier Chinese laws regarding Chinese Language Simplification, character ‘鎔’should have always been written as ‘熔’; however, Zhu Rongji insisted on writing ‘鎔’ when it came down to writing his name because he was originally named in the character ‘鎔’but not ‘熔’. Thus, the Board later re-introduced the character. Supporters of traditional characters often use this example in against the use of simplified Chinese, especially when it comes down to mergers of characters in names of historical heroes, scholars, philosophers, and political figures. They also report trouble in flight reservations when traveling in and out of mainland China due to the mergers of characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china-language.gov.cn/115/2007_6_25/1_115_1817_0_1182773044828.html |title=汉字规范的换位思考 |publisher=中国语言文字网 |date=2005-07-08 |accessdate=2014-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021074254/http://www.china-language.gov.cn/115/2007_6_25/1_115_1817_0_1182773044828.html |archive-date=2013-10-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On top of all that has been previously mentioned, the left-side radical of 鎔 (which is the left-side version of 金) is almost never seen in simplified characters, since it has largely been replaced by the simplified left-side radical seen in characters like 银, 铜, and 钱.
*Professor Wang, at Beijing University of Education, also the Vice President of Chinese Language Association, and an official of Ministry of Education of China, agreed and criticized that some characters were oversimplified during the simplification campaign, and thus more difficult to learn, apply, and use. Wang particularly pointed at merged characters borne with these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdpark.net/html/xinwen/shiping/2009/0418/927.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620012048/http://www.hdpark.net/html/xinwen/shiping/2009/0418/927.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 June 2009|title=专家称国家将出新规范汉字表 改进部分简化字_海德公园|date=20 June 2009|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speed of writing==
===Simplified characters===
*Simplified characters have fewer [[Stroke (CJK character)|strokes]]. For example, the common character 邊 (''biān'', meaning "side") has 18 strokes in traditional form, while its simplified form 边 has only 5. Proponents of simplification claim this makes them easier to write.&lt;ref name="Gunde, Richard 2002" /&gt;  Characters with more than 15 strokes are especially difficult to write.&lt;ref name="Liu"&gt;Liu, Jennifer Li-chia. Yan, Margaret Mian (1997). Interactions I-II: A Cognitive Approach to Beginning Chinese.  Indiana University Press. {{ISBN|0-253-21122-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Input method]]s for electronic devices are commonplace today and can be thought of as a form of simplification of Chinese characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xys.org/fang/doc/history/jianhua3.txt|format=TXT|title= Talk about simplified words|author=Fang Zhou|website=Xys.org|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Input method for electronic devices, and access to computers generally, are still the privilege of a few in mainland China, where the [[Digital divide in China|digital divide is strong]].&lt;ref name="LPP"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Planning and Policy in Asia|first=Robert|last=Kaplan|first2=Richard|last2=Baldauf|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2008|pages=69, 71, 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*People educated in traditional characters will often make extensive ad-hoc character simplifications in their handwriting to save time. This is similar to the practice of using abbreviations in informal written English (i.e. "thru" for "through") and proponents of traditional characters reply that this does not mean that the informal simplifications should be adopted as standard.&lt;ref name="Mair"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinyin.info/news/2006/simplified-characters-inside-and-outside-of-the-people%E2%80%99s-republic-of-china/|title=Simplified characters inside and outside of the People's Republic of China|date=2006-12-13|accessdate=2012-03-02|publisher=Pinyin News|first=Victor|last=Mair|authorlink=Victor H. Mair}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in Taiwan where simplified characters are prohibited in official documents, signs can also sometimes have simplified characters. For example, 魯菜 is sometimes simplified as 鲁菜, as the character 鲁 and its variant 魯 would hardly be distinguishable if they were written with large strokes.

===Traditional characters===
*Opponents say that the speed advantage of simplified Chinese becomes less relevant in the computer age.&lt;ref name="CHQ"/&gt; With modern computing, entering Chinese characters is now dependent on the convenience of [[input method editor]]s or IMEs. Most IMEs use [[phoneme]]-based input, such as [[pinyin]] romanization or [[bopomofo]], while others are [[grapheme]]-based, such as [[cangjie method|cangjie]] and [[wubi method|wubi]]. These have mainly sidelined the speed problems in handwritten Chinese, as traditional and simplified Chinese input methods have the same input speed, especially with phoneme-based IMEs. Thus, characters like 體/体 may be just as easy to input as the other, while the traditional form—though more complex—may offer a more distinctive shape that is therefore less easily confused with other common characters. (體 would never, for instance, be mistaken for 休.) Furthermore, even when it comes to handwriting, a majority of people resort to [[semi-cursive script]] to reduce strokes and save time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
*The digital divide in China can hardly be attributed to the electronic usage of traditional forms, as these are just as accessible via phonemic input systems, like pinyin or bopomofo, as are the simplified forms. Furthermore, it is certainly possible to enter simplified graphemic forms that are then, on-screen, converted to the more complex traditional forms.
*Any considerations of ink usage which might have saved some ink in printing by using simplified forms are irrelevant when text is displayed electronically on a screen.

==Phonetics==

===Relation with simplified characters===
*Proponents point out that Chinese characters are most often made up of a pronunciation-indicating part (called the ''phonetic'') and a part that indicates the general [[semantics|semantic]] domain (called the ''radical''). During the process of simplification, there are some attempts to bring greater coherence to the system. For example, the shape of 憂 (''yōu''), meaning "anxious", is not a good indicator of its pronunciation, because there are no clear radical and phonetic components. The simplified version is 忧, a straightforward combination of [[Radical 61|忄]], the "heart" radical to the left (indicating emotion) and the phonetic 尤 (''yóu'') to the right.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
*Simplification emphasizes the phonetic, rather than semantic, nature of the characters. Most Chinese speakers are familiar with [[Standard Chinese]], which the pronunciation is based on.&lt;ref name="Mair"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Poser"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003997.html|title=Notes on Chinese Character Simplification|date=2007-01-03|accessdate=2012-03-02|first=Bill|last=Poser|publisher=[[Language Log]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation with traditional characters===
*Opponents point out that some simplified forms undermine the phonetics of the original characters, e.g. 盤 (''pán'', plate) has the phonetic component 般 (''bān'') on top, but the simplified form is 盘, whose upper part is now 舟 (''zhōu''). 盧 (''lú'', a [[family name]]) and 爐 (''lú'', "furnace") shares the same component 盧 in their original forms, but they were inconsistently simplified into 卢 and 炉 respectively, so that 炉 now has the less helpful 户 (''hù'') as its phonetic. For the simplification to be consistent, 卢 should have been used instead of 户 as the righthand component in 炉, as they are originally identical as 盧.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Zhengzhang Shangfang|Zhengzhang, Shangfang]] ({{zh|鄭張尚芳}}) (2003). {{lang|zh|上古音系}} (''Old Chinese Phonology''), Shanghai: Shanghai Education Press. {{ISBN|978-7-5320-9244-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some characters were radically stripped of all phonetic elements. An example of a traditional character simplified such that its phonetic element is totally removed is 廣 (''guǎng'', meaning "extensive"), of which the internal character 黃 (''huáng'') is enclosed within a 广. Simplified, the character is written without its internal phonetic element, and with no replacement: 广.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Arieh|title=Reflections on China: The folly of simplified characters|url=http://www.chicagomaroon.com/2009/8/9/reflections-on-china-the-folly-of-simplified-characters|publisher=The Chicago Maroon|accessdate=2 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328003810/http://chicagomaroon.com/2009/8/9/reflections-on-china-the-folly-of-simplified-characters/|archivedate=28 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A classic feature of the traditional Chinese writing system is its versatility in representing not only the range of spoken varieties of the Chinese language—many of them mutually unintelligible to one another in speech—but also certain vastly different [[Sino-xenic|languages outside of China]]. The re-phonologizing of simplified characters further jeopardizes the writing system's traditional ability to bring mutual understanding between speakers of different, especially non-[[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] Chinese dialects.&lt;ref name="Poser"/&gt;
* Uncoordinated simplification policies imposed on postwar Japan have led to instances of there being three forms of the same character in widespread use, for example, traditional 關 was simplified to 関 in postwar Japan but to 关 in the PRC.  (In general, the new Japanese orthography made many fewer changes to the writing system than Simplified Chinese.)

==Radicals==

===Simplified radicals===
*Proponents say that the radical system is imperfect in the first place. For example, 笑 (smile, laugh) uses the "bamboo" radical, which has no obvious relation to smiling or laughing.
*The removal of the radical 雨 from the traditional word 電 (electricity) is a sign that Chinese is moving into the modern era because 雨 (rain radical) symbolizes that electricity comes from lightning; nowadays, electricity can come from more sources than just lightning.&lt;ref name="Poser"/&gt;
*The creators of simplified characters tried to retain semantic clues in characters wherever possible, which is why the simplification is not systematic. For example, ''càn'' (燦, "burning, bright") was simplified to 灿, retaining both the masculine "fire" radical (火) as well as a [[yin and yang|balancing]] "mountain" element (山).&lt;ref name="Hodge&amp;Louie"/&gt;
*Character simplification removed a number of [[graphic pejoratives in written Chinese|offensive radicals]], replacing the old character 僮 ''Zhuàng'' for the [[Zhuang people]] (meaning "child, boy servant") with another Zhuàng (壮 "strong, robust").&lt;ref&gt;[[John Defrancis|Defrancis, John]] (1984). ''The Chinese Language: Fact and Fantasy'', p. 117. University of Hawaii Press. {{ISBN|0-8248-0866-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional radicals===
*Some argue that simplification results in a broken connection between characters, which makes it more difficult for students to expand their vocabulary in terms of perceiving both the meaning and pronunciation of a new character.  For example, 鬧, ''nào'' (din, fuss) is now 闹, with the door radical [[Radical 169|门]] that is not indicative of its meaning.&lt;ref name="CHQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaheritagequarterly.org/updates.php?searchterm=0903characters.inc|title=The Chinese Character—no simple matter|work=China Heritage Quarterly|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate=2012-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The round of characters simplified by the Communist Party was not systematic.&lt;ref name="Mcbride"&gt;McBride-Chang, Catherine.  Chen, Hsuan-Chih. (2003).  Reading development in Chinese Children.  Praeger/Greenwood publishing.  {{ISBN|0-89789-809-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Extensive studies have been conducted among different age groups, especially children, to show that reducing the strokes loses the radical and phonetic relationships between the characters.  This actually makes it more difficult for simplified character readers to distinguish the characters, since they now rely heavily on memorization.&lt;ref name="Mcbride" /&gt;
* Some traditional characters are very distinct, such as electricity/lightning 電 ''diàn'', rope 繩 ''shéng'' and turtle 龜 ''gūi''.  After the simplification process all three characters appear to have the same components even though they have no relationship at all.  Respectively electricity 电, rope 绳, turtle 龟 can now conceivably be mistaken for one another, while their distinctions in the traditional forms are unmistakable. The simplification of the word electricity/lightning 電 to 电 also took it out of the natural context.&lt;ref&gt;The same radical was similarly removed in the simplification of "clouds" 雲 to 云.&lt;/ref&gt; Stripped of its radical, 电 no longer bears any sense of semantic affinity with characters like snow 雪, thunder 雷, and hail 雹, themselves all untouched in the PRC simplification scheme.&lt;ref name="Poser"/&gt;
*Critics of the proposed replacement for the traditional system of radicals see the new system as being no less arbitrary than the existing system, it therefore only complicating matters to introduce a competing standard that as a radical departure from traditional radical arrangement might cause more confusion than simplification.&lt;ref&gt;The traditional system of radicals is no more arbitrary than, by analogy, the traditional order of the letters of the [[English alphabet]], or the English names for the letters, all of these being to varying extents agreed-upon standards which have enjoyed supreme precedence in their respective orthographic traditions. Any attempt to simplify or reform established standards must demonstrate extreme utility to be worth the risk of the confusion and complications that inevitably arise when such arbitrary standards are changed to new standards, especially when the new standards are just as arbitrary as the old ones, if not more so.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==

===Simplified aesthetics===
*Simplified Chinese characters are more legible when small fonts are used. The fine details of traditional Chinese characters are easy to discern in large size [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] but a number of very complex characters are much harder to identify when smaller fonts are used and complex character components can merge. This problem is exacerbated by low-quality printing. The recognition issue applies to some [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] software as well.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- which software is bad? --&gt; Such software is more accurate with [[hanzi]] with fewer details.
*About 30% of simplified Chinese characters match simplified [[kanji]] (see [[shinjitai]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sungwh.freeserve.co.uk/hanzi/j-s.htm Japanese Simplications] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218203648/http://www.sungwh.freeserve.co.uk/hanzi/j-s.htm |date=December 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it easier for people who know simplified characters to be able to read and understand Japanese kanji. For example, the character 国 (country) is written the same way in Japanese (国) although in traditional Chinese it is 國.
*Chinese calligraphy has favored the radical simplification of characters, especially in the [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]] and [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive styles]]. In semi-cursive script, the six-stroke character xíng (行, running) is reduced to just two strokes.&lt;ref name="rfd"/&gt;

===Traditional aesthetics===

*Aesthetic continuity with China's immense heritage of art, literature, and calligraphy is diminished by the supplanting of characters that have been in standard use for centuries with an arbitrary selection of vernacular and shorthand variants along with many invented forms that are nowhere to be found in most writings, inscriptions, and art made in China before the 20th century.
*Traditional Chinese characters are often used as the standard characters set in Chinese calligraphy in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and are even allowed for calligraphy in the PRC, presumably because of its aesthetic value.&lt;ref&gt;''Advantages and Disadvantages on Traditional Characters vs Simplified Characters'', 2002, published by Government of City of Taipei, Republic of China [http://www.taipei.gov.tw/site/41f46a99/42119aed/files/advantage.doc] In point 3, it reads "''Traditional characters is aesthetically pleasing, and therefore it is widely used by people who practice Chinese calligraphy throughout the world including countries such as Japan, Korea as well as mainland China. It is because traditional characters is able to express the artistic essence of calligraphy."''&lt;/ref&gt;
*A strong preference for the aesthetics of traditional characters among Mainland Chinese is evident in their significant usage of traditional forms in artistic work, signage, advertising, and internet screen names.
*Even though about 30% of simplified Chinese characters match simplified kanji, those who understand traditional Chinese will understand a much greater proportion of Japanese Kanji, as the current standard Japanese character set is much more similar to traditional Chinese.
*Simplified characters, such as 门 for 門 (''mén'', door) look like the universal informal handwritten form, and look as improper as [[cursive]] would look in printed English.&lt;ref name="Poser"/&gt;

==Practicality==

===Practicality of simplified characters===
Traditional Chinese characters are only still used primarily by those in Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong and many overseas communities, comprising a small minority of the Chinese-speaking population (~50 million people). However, they also remain in use in mainland China for artistic, scholarly and advertising purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=826842&amp;lang=eng_news |title=Taiwan promotes traditional Chinese characters |publisher=Etaiwannews.com |date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simplified Chinese has come to dominate the written form of Chinese used nearly all over the world, due to the size and rising influence of mainland China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=825469&amp;lang=eng_news |title=Cross-strait cooperation may help Chinese become world heritage |publisher=Etaiwannews.com |date=2008-12-30 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] has also used simplified Chinese since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shanghaidaily.com/editor/article.asp?id=200]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330103818/http://www.shanghaidaily.com/editor/article.asp?id=200|date=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moving back to traditional characters on the mainland has the potential to be difficult, confusing, and time-consuming.&lt;ref name="CHQ"/&gt;
*Chinese text written before the 20th century was in [[Classical Chinese]], which is much different from the [[written vernacular Chinese]] used today, even in traditional characters. Learning to read the older texts requires additional study, even from Chinese-speakers educated in traditional characters. Many versions of the Chinese Classics have been published in simplified characters.&lt;ref name="Zhou"/&gt;
*Acceptance of simplified characters is increasing, mirroring acceptance of the [[pinyin]] romanization system that was once a PRC and now an international standard, although with much greater resistance and to a significantly lesser extent. In the 1960s and 1970s, [[Chinese as a foreign language]] was taught in countries like France and the United States solely in traditional characters. In the 1990s, universities in the United States were split between simplified and traditional, with simplified growing and traditional being taught mainly for the benefit of those who wish to learn [[Classical Chinese]], or Chinese for use in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, or overseas Chinese communities. Today, in terms of teaching and learning Chinese as a foreign language outside of China, the simplified characters has "become the first choice because of student demand".&lt;ref name=Teaching&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching and Learning Chinese as a Foreign Language: A Pedagogical Grammar|first=Janet Zhiqun|last=Xing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1drHAQAAQBAJ|publisher=[[Hong Kong University Press]]|year=2006|pages=31–32, 105, 323|isbn=978-962-209-763-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, some instructors allow students the choice to write in either simplified or traditional characters.
*With today's [[division of labor]], not all students need to learn to read classical texts.&lt;ref name="rfd"/&gt; Schoolchildren can learn simplified characters first, and then traditional characters later if they want to be linguists or historians.&lt;ref name="Zhou"/&gt;

===Practicality of traditional characters===
*If the PRC was able to impose its scheme of simplified characters on the majority of Chinese people, then a reversion to the use of traditional characters could hardly be any less feasible. From the pro-traditional point of view, there is as much reason, if not more, to return to the traditional orthography, as there ever was to simplify in the first place. Furthermore, it would be fatalistic and patronizing to deem Chinese people incapable of learning the older forms due merely to the sheer prevalence of simplified characters' usage in most of China today.
*While written communication with the large population of mainland China and other communities requires the use of simplified Chinese, there are compelling practical reasons which require the use of traditional characters. The [[Republic of China]] (ROC) is the largest community of traditional character users and ROC President [[Ma Ying-jeou]] pushed for the removal of simplified Chinese translations which were available for use by Mainland internet users on government websites before June 15, 2011. Government documents and websites are to only use traditional characters and while simplified characters are not banned in Taiwan the president strongly encouraged the exclusive use of traditional characters, even in the tourism sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roc-taiwan.org/ct.asp?xItem=205227&amp;ctNode=2825&amp;mp=52 |title=ROC to use traditional Chinese characters for official documents, websites |publisher=Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Los Angeles |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2014-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221224843/http://www.roc-taiwan.org/ct.asp?xItem=205227&amp;ctNode=2825&amp;mp=52 |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This move to protect traditional characters ensures that visitors to the Republic of China will need to learn traditional characters if they wish to use Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/editorial/taiwan-issues/2011/06/19/306696/p1/Ma-correct.htm |title=Ma correct to advocate use of traditional Chinese characters |publisher=The China Post |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another common practical reason for the continuation of traditional characters is the expansive cultural legacy of Chinese history and art prior to simplification. The written form did evolve over the centuries but the traditional character set used today is much more closely related to the written Chinese which has been in use for thousands of years. As such the traditional characters are said to provide access to Chinese culture prior to simplification.&lt;ref name="rfd"/&gt;
*Those wishing to communicate or do business with overseas Chinese communities in the Western World require knowledge of traditional characters given their dominance in such communities and the negative connotations many in these communities associate with simplified characters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}
*Many Chinese character dictionary apps can display both traditional and simplified versions of Chinese words, so being able to switch between character systems should not pose any major issues when reading traditional characters.

==Politics==
The long history of Chinese characters and the role of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] in the design and adoption of simplified characters means that there is often a strong political aspect to the debate on the usage of traditional and simplified Chinese characters.

===Communist Party and simplified characters===
*While the use of simplified Chinese is often associated with the PRC and its ruling Communist party the connection today is not as simple as it once may have been. Many simplified Chinese texts are published outside of mainland China. Chinese newspapers in Singapore and Malaysia are mainly published in simplified Chinese, although overseas publications, such as in Chinese communities in the U.S., still mostly use traditional characters.&lt;ref name="Farr"/&gt; Most university Chinese programs in the United States and France teach simplified characters,&lt;ref name=Teaching/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy|last=Norden|first=Bryan W. Van|publisher=[[Hackett Publishing Company|Hackett Publishing]]|year=2011|isbn=9781603846158|page=242|quote=Most contemporary Chinese language programs at U.S. colleges and universities emphasize the simplified form.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number continues to rise.&lt;ref name=Teaching/&gt;  The internet is also increasingly diverse, with many websites including Wikipedia offering an easy [[Chinese Wikipedia#Automatic conversion between traditional and simplified Chinese|switch between simplified and traditional scripts]].
*Character simplification began in 1956 and had origins going back to the early 20th century before the founding of the PRC.&lt;ref name="CHQ"/&gt; Even the Kuomintang developed a draft plan for character simplification in 1935, and as late as 1946 made positive statements about simplified characters like "As long as it doesn't use [romanization] or [bopomofo], anything can be considered ''guoyu''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sound and Script in Chinese Diaspora|first=Jing|last=Tsu|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Character simplification was not a part of the [[Four Olds]] nor the [[Cultural Revolution]] (both began in the mid 1960s). Whether traditional characters were "destroyed" or not is a matter of opinion, others might say they were "modified". Chinese culture is not static; Chinese people no longer wear [[Han Chinese clothing]] and this is not considered a big loss to Chinese culture.&lt;ref name="CHQ"/&gt;
*Simplified Chinese characters were not entirely developed by the PRC as some of the simplified characters were taken from Japanese [[Shinjitai]], such as 学 from 學 (''xué'', to study).&lt;ref name="Poser"/&gt;
*Promotion of traditional characters is sometimes characterized as a Taiwanese plot to sabotage China's language policy and to promote [[Sinocentrism]] and Chinese cultural nationalism, thereby undermining China's relation with national minorities and isolating China from the world.&lt;ref name="LPP"/&gt;
*Those who use simplified characters often remark that the subject is a simple one which has been made overly complicated by political considerations. They claim that the use of simplified characters or traditional characters should be decided based on pragmatic or aesthetic reasons, not political ones.&lt;ref name="Zhou"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2008-03/22/content_6558770.htm|title='Jianti' and 'fanti' are equally good|first=Raymond|last=Zhou|publisher=[[China Daily]]|date=2008-03-22|accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalist usage of traditional characters===
*In the communities where traditional characters are used, simplified characters are strongly associated with [[Maoism]] and [[iconoclasm]] and so they are viewed very negatively. By extension, continued use of traditional characters has been a conspicuous way of maintaining national cultural identity.&lt;ref name="Guo"&gt;Guo, Yingjie. (2004). Routledge. Cultural Nationalism in Contemporary China: The Search for National Identity under reform. {{ISBN|0-415-32264-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; School children in these areas are strongly discouraged from using simplified characters. In Taiwan especially, simplified characters have been regarded as "Communist" (viz. PRC propaganda), and accordingly they are quite diligently avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Henry. (2005) Writing Systems: A Linguistic Approach. Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|0-631-23464-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*More specifically, character simplification, in light of the destructive, "Anti-[[Four Olds]]" during the [[Cultural Revolution]], is sometimes characterized a "Communist plot" to cut off traditional Chinese culture and values.&lt;ref name="Farr"&gt;Rohsenow, John S. [http://www.ccamuseum.org/index.php/en/research/research-1900-on/442-chinese-language-use-in-chicagoland "Chinese Language Use in Chicagoland"] from ''Ethnolinguistic Chicago: Language and Literacy in the City's Neighborhoods.''

*The use of two different writing systems has made it easier for the [[Communist Party of China]] to selectively censor the domestic reprinting of Chinese-language books first published outside the PRC, as, by requiring Chinese publishers to print a new edition in simplified characters provides an opportunity to prevent a book from being printed at all in the mainland. For example, the book ''Whispers and Moans'' was very popular in Hong Kong but a simplified character edition was blocked by Beijing's Central Bureau of Censorship, and the original edition could not be sold legally on the mainland because it was in traditional characters. The book, which is about the [[sex trade]] in Hong Kong, was said to conflict with the mainland's [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law]].&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;Yang, Yishan. Whispers and Moans: Interviews with the Men and Women of Hong Kong's Sex industry. (2006). Blacksmith Books. {{ISBN|962-86732-8-9}}. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments in the 21st century==
In recent years, the official Campaign of Simplification of Chinese Language has caused many controversial discussions in the general public to higher level of the government in [[People's Republic of China|mainland China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]] and amongst some international organisations.

===2007===
In November 2007, scholars and representatives from [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[mainland China]], and [[Taiwan]] came to [[Beijing]] and joined the Eighth Annual International Conference of Chinese Language Study.  The conference was conducted and hosted by the National Office of International Promotion of Chinese Language and Board of Language Usage &amp; Applications of the Ministry of Education of China. Immediately after, Korean media reported that the scholars and representatives reached a few conclusions after long discussion in the conference. One of those conclusions was that scholars would be using Traditional Chinese characters to standardise 5000 common Chinese characters across the countries and would continue to allow the use of Simplified Chinese characters if there happened to have one across those different areas. However, Chinese officials claimed that they did not reach such an agreement but would like to see the harmonious coexistence of Traditional and Simplified Chinese. Still, to many, that was the approval from Chinese Government because they were no longer absolutely opposed to the use of Traditional Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hk.epochtimes.com/7/11/8/54463.htm |title=漢字擬統一 正體字為主-香港大紀元 |publisher=The Epoch Times |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/world/2007-11/07/content_7024376.htm |title=韓國媒體報道有誤 中日韓並無協議統一漢字 |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008===

In March 2008, a Mainland author, Wang Gan, published a review article on his personal blog about the possibility of the re-introduction of Traditional Chinese, ''What About Abolishing Simplified Chinese within the Next 50 Years?''.&lt;ref&gt;Wang Gan, 2008-03-02, [http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_47458e6501008kwi.html 五十年内，废除简化字如何]&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-one members of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC) delivered a proposal to add Traditional Chinese characters to the primary school curriculum. The proposal was rejected by the Minister of Education, who explained, 'Our nation has its fundamental governing principles. [One of them, by law, is] to promote the usage of Simplified Chinese and Mandarin. This is the basic condition… Thus, we will not consider re-introducing Traditional Chinese education in our primary school curricula.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.163.com/08/0313/03/46STG4KE0001124J.html |title=宋祖英等联名提议:小学应增加繁体字教育 |publisher=[[NetEase]] |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/edu/2008-03/15/content_7792926.htm |title=教育部部长周济表示不考虑"小学增设繁体字教育" |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.xinhuanet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/tw/2008-07/06/content_8497936.htm |title=马英九：台湾不会改简体字 但会用繁、简对照 |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120421050332/http://news.5s5w.com/4/2008/20080314_content_45347.shtml] &lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2008, on his visit to Taiwanese writer Koarn Hack Tarn's home, Taiwanese President [[Ying-jeou Ma|Ma Ying-jeou]] promised that he would not introduce the usage of Simplified Chinese into the territories just because of the local newly passed policy to let Mainland tourists visit Taiwan but to provide side-by-side translation so that Mainland visitors could appreciate the aesthetic nature of Traditional Chinese. And he also told journalists that he wished all Chinese people would eventually be using Traditional Chinese in the near future.&lt;ref name="news.xinhuanet.com" /&gt;

===2009===
In early 2009, the [[Republic of China|ROC]] ([[Taiwan]]) government launched a campaign to obtain [[World Heritage]] status for [[Traditional Chinese characters]] in a bid to preserve them for the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2009/01/02/2003432639 Taipei Times - Thousands gather to set record] (2 Jan 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; At the Eleventh National People's Congress, a representative from Taiwan, Ms. Chen Jun, called for the Chinese government to support the world heritage campaign. She also suggested the introduction of Traditional Characters education into mainland primary and secondary education to improve passion for and understanding of traditional Chinese culture and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=jlee |url=http://zhuanti.youth.cn/2009/09lh/yw/200903/t20090310_875201.htm |title=台籍代表：建议两岸联手为中文繁体字"申遗" |publisher=Zhuanti.youth.cn |date=2009-03-10 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a March 2009 CPPCC meeting, member Pan Qinglin proposed that simplified characters should be abolished and Traditional Character usage reimplemented over the course of ten years. His proposal was widely criticized as frivolous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zhang|first=Jessica|title=Heated debate on abolishing simplified Chinese character|url=http://www.china.org.cn/government/NPC_CPPCC_2009/2009-03/12/content_17431913.htm|accessdate=28 January 2014|date=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences China Studies Forum in April 2009, it was announced that some adjustments would be made to the simplified characters. Experts acknowledged that some of the earlier character simplifications were problematic and inhibited understanding. Academics expressed support for the concept of "know traditional, write simplified" and specifically rejected the idea of reintroducing traditional characters as too costly and impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.southcn.com/community/shms/content/2009-04/09/content_5050207.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-05-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720143856/http://news.southcn.com/community/shms/content/2009-04/09/content_5050207.htm |archive-date=2011-07-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They cited a survey of ninety-one top-ranked senior classical Chinese literature and Chinese language students from Beijing Normal University testing their ability to write Traditional Characters, which only three students passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://big5.chinanews.com.cn:89/cul/news/2009/04-09/1637435.shtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711153503/http://big5.chinanews.com.cn:89/cul/news/2009/04-09/1637435.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-11 |title=專家：恢復繁體字不可取 建議"識繁用簡" |publisher=中新網 |date=2009-04-09 |accessdate=2014-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{note|1|a}}In Taiwan, traditional characters are officially known as "proper characters" ({{zh|t=[[:wikt:正|正]]體字|s=正体字|p=zhèngtǐ zì|first=t}}), while most Chinese speakers outside Taiwan, whether using simplified or traditional characters, refer to traditional characters as "complex characters" ({{zh|t=[[:wikt:繁|繁]]體字|s=繁体字|p=fántǐ zì}}).

==Literary scholarship==

Neog's contributions to the history of Assamese literature and language is impeccable.He had authored around 100 books. His works ranged from  story, verses, novel, drama, history of literature and criticism to folk-literature.  Neog is best known as a critic of Assamese literature. According to the [[Sahitya Akademi]], India's National Academy of Letters, two of Neog's works on Assamese literature "made significant contribution to the development of critical assessment in Assamese literature on an academic plane."&lt;ref name=sahitya&gt;{{cite book|last=Datta|first=Amaresh|title=The Encyclopaedia Of Indian Literature (Volume One (A To Devo), Volume 1|year=2006|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=India|isbn=81-260-1803-8|pages=774|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&amp;pg=PA774&amp;dq=Dimbeswar+Neog&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0iINTsCAOKKPmQWdssSeDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Dimbeswar%20Neog&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neog's approach to literary criticism has, however, been criticized as being "not entirely free of personal prejudice"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Indian literature, an anthology|year=1992|editor=George, K.M.|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-7201-324-0|pages=63–64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1R2Pa3f7r0C&amp;dq=Dimbeswar+Neog&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "occasionally vitiated by his biased analysis."&lt;ref name=sahitya/&gt;

== Memorial Committee ==
A memorial committee entitled ''''Dimbeswar Neog Xuworoni Santha'''' (Dimbeswar Neog Memorial Committee) in honour of Dimbeswar Neog was formed at his residence in the year 1969 under the aegis of his eldest son Late Basanta Mangal Neog. Gradually, the committee was officially constituted with Dr.Bhupen RoyChodhury as its first secretary and the memorial meetings began to be organized on a public domain for the greater interest of the people. Since then, the committee has been annually organizing the memorial meetings on the 12 November, which is Neog's death anniversary.Prominent scholars and literary geniuses of the state have graced this yearly occasion from time to time as chief speakers, speaking about his invaluable contribution to Assamese literature as well as by being present as distinguished guests. Recitation of his poems, songs penned by him are also performed in these meetings as an ode to him.  
In the year 1992, ''''Dimbeswar Neog Xuworoni Santha'''' has been renamed to ''''Dimbeswar Neog-Aajaleetara Neog Xuworoni Saurabh Samiti'''' to commemorate his better-half, Ajaleetara Neog, who had been closely associated with children's literature herself. The committee has been conducting art competitions among children from time to time in the memory of Ajaleetara Neog as well as Dimbeswar Neog.
In order to mark the glorious 45 years of this memorial committee, a special presentation has been screened at the yearly memorial meeting of 2014.

A '''diverticulum''' (plural: ''diverticula'') is the [[medicine|medical]] or [[biology|biological]] term for an outpouching of a hollow (or a fluid-filled) structure in the body. Depending upon which layers of the structure are involved, they are described as being either true or false.

In medicine, the term usually implies the structure is not normally present. However, in the [[embryo]]nic stage, some normal structures begin development as a diverticulum arising from another structure.

==Anatomical==
[[Guttural pouch]]: A large (300-500 ml), paired, air-filled ventral diverticulum of the auditory tube found in [[horse]]s and other [[Perissodactyla]].

==Classification==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
Diverticula are described as being true or false depending upon the layers involved:

*True diverticula involve all layers of the structure, including [[muscularis propria]] and [[adventitia]], such as [[Meckel's diverticulum]].
*False diverticula (also known as "pseudodiverticula") do not involve muscular layers or [[adventitia]]. False diverticula, in the GI tract for instance, involve only the [[submucosa]] and [[mucosa]].

==Human pathology==
*Bladder diverticulum: Balloon-like growths on the bladder commonly associated with a chronic outflow obstruction, such as [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] in older males. Usually found in pairs on opposite sides of the bladder, bladder diverticula are often surgically removed to prevent infection, rupture, or even cancer.
*Cardiac diverticulum: A very rare congenital malformation of the heart that is usually benign &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Vazquez-Jimenez | first=Dr. Jaime | url=http://www.orpha.net/data/patho/Pro/en/CardiacDiverticulum-FRenPro3437.pdf | title=Cardiac diverticulum | year=2003 | publisher= Orphanet Encyclopedia | accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Diverticulosis|Colonic diverticula]]: These can become infected (see [[diverticulitis]]) and can perforate, requiring surgery
*[[Diverticulum of Kommerell]]: unusual nomenclature, in that focal dilatations of a blood vessel are properly referred to as aneurysms
*Duodenal and jejunal diverticul(um|a): congenital lesions, may be a source of bacterial overgrowth, may perforate and may result in abscesses
*Epiphrenic diverticulum: due to dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter, as in [[achalasia]]

Diverticula may occur in one of the three areas of the esophagus - the pharyngoesophageal, the midesophageal area or the epiphrenic area of esophagus. Zenker's diverticulum is found three times more frequently in men than in women. It occurs posteriorly through the cricopharyngeal muscle in the midline of the neck. Usually seen in people older than 60 years of age.
*[[Gastric diverticula]] - "Although usually asymptomatic, they may cause vague [[epigastric]] pain. These lesions may be confused radiologically for [[gastric ulcers]] or cancers. [[Endoscopically]], they may be confused for [[paraesophageal hernias]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = V.| title = Gastric diverticulum| journal = Surgical Endoscopy| volume = 8| last1 = Velanovich| issue = 11| pages = 1338–1339| year = 1994| pmid = 7831610| doi = 10.1007/BF00188296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Traction esophageal diverticulum: due to scarring from mediastinal or pulmonary tuberculosis
*Urethral diverticulum: congenital in males, post-infectious in females

Most of these pathological types of diverticulum are capable of harboring an [[enterolith]]. If the enterolith stays in place, it may cause no problems, but a large enterolith expelled from a diverticulum into the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] can cause obstruction.

{{Western Ganga kings}}
'''Durvinita''' ({{reign|529|579 CE}}) is seen as the most successful ruler of the [[Western Ganga dynasty]]. Son of the previous ruler, [[Avinita]], Durvinita's accession to the throne was disputed by his brother, who had gained the support of the [[Pallavas]] and [[Kadambas]]. There are Nallala and Kadagattur inscriptions that refer to this dispute. However, Durvinita managed to grab the throne by virtue of his valour.

==Hostilities with Pallavas and Kadambas==
During Durvinita's rule, the hostilities between the Pallavas and Gangas came to forefront and several pitched battles were fought by the two kingdoms. Durvinita defeated the Pallavas in the battle of Anderi. Though the Pallavas sought the assistance of the [[Kadambas]] to the north to tame Durvinita, the Gummareddipura inscription hails that Durvinita overcame his enemies at Alattur, Porulare and Pernagra. It is possible that these victories enabled him to extend his power over Kongudesa and Tondaimandalam regions of Tamil country. He may have also made Kittur his capital.

==Ties with Chalukyas==
Durvinita was a clever king. In order to keep the Pallavas at bay, he gave his daughter to [[Chalukya]] [[Vijayaditya]] or from the Nagara record to [[Pulakesi II]], though the latter is unlikely owing to the difference in their eras. The Chalukyas were an emerging power at this time. When the Pallavas attacked the Chalukyas, he fought on the Chalukya side and cemented a long lasting friendship with the Chalukyas that lasted through the rule of both the Badami Chalukyas, [[Rashtrakutas]] and Kalyani Chalukyas, covering a period of over 600 years.The Gummareddipura and the Uttanur plates describe Durvinita as the ''Lord of Punnata''.

==Religion and literature==
The early Gangas were worshipers of the Hindu god Vishnu. However Durvinita had a [[Jain]]a guru called [[Pujyapada]] and his court was adorned with several Jain scholars. This tolarance was common among later Ganga kings, who actually took to Jainism in the later centuries. Durvinita was an able warrior as well as a man of letter and the fine arts. [[Kavirajamarga]], the 850 CE Kannada classic hails him as one of the early writers in [[Kannada language]] prose, though his Kannada writings are not available. The renowned Sanskrit poet [[Bharavi]] is known to have visited the Western Ganga court during this period. Durvinita wrote a commentary on the fifteenth ''canto'' (chapter) of Bharavi's ''Kiratarjuniya''. He translated into Sanskrit ''Vaddakatha'' or ''Brihatkatha'' written originally by Gunadya in the Prakrit language. He also authored a writing called ''Sabdavatara''.{{sfn|Narasimhacharya|1988|p=3}} His prowess in the battle field, knowledge of war instruments and arms, political science, medicine, music and dance has been eulogized in the Nallala grant inscription.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Legacy==
Durvinita is mentioned as a notable Kannada prose writer in one of the works of [[Amoghavarsha]].{{sfn|Narasimhacharya|1988|p=2}}

{{Indian Constitution TOC}}
The '''Eighth Schedule''' to the [[Constitution of India]] lists the official [[Languages of India|languages of the Republic of India]]. At the time when the Constitution was enacted, inclusion in this list meant that the language was entitled to representation on the [[Official Languages Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of India, Article [http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/p17344.html 344(1)].&lt;/ref&gt; and that the language would be one of the bases that would be drawn upon to enrich Hindi, the [[official language]] of the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of India, Article [http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/p17351.html 351].&lt;/ref&gt; The list has since, however, acquired further significance. The Government of India is now under an obligation to take measures for the development of these languages, such that "they grow rapidly in richness and become effective means of communicating modern knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Official Languages Resolution, 1968, [http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolresolutioneng.htm para. 2]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318123802/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolresolutioneng.htm |date=March 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a candidate appearing in an examination conducted for public service is entitled to use any of these languages as the medium in which he or she answers the paper.&lt;ref&gt;Official Languages Resolution, 1968, [http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolresolutioneng.htm para. 4]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318123802/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolresolutioneng.htm |date=March 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Per Articles 344(1) and 351 of the [[Constitution of India|Indian Constitution]], the eighth schedule includes the recognition of the following 22 [[languages]]:&lt;ref&gt;The Constitution of India by P. M. Bakshi&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}
# [[Assamese language|Assamese]]
# [[Bengali language|Bengali]]

{{div col end}}
Of these languages, 14 were initially included in the Constitution. Subsequently, Sindhi was added in 1967 by 21st constitutional amendment act; Konkani, Manipuri and Nepali were added in 1992 by 71st Constitutional Amendment Act; and Bodo, Dogri, Maithili and Santali were added in 2003 by 92nd Constitutional Amendment Act.&lt;ref&gt;http://mha.nic.in/hindi/sites/upload_files/mhahindi/files/pdf/Eighth_Schedule.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demand for more languages for inclusion in the Eighth Schedule==
At present, as per [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]],&lt;ref&gt;http://mha.nic.in/hindi/sites/upload_files/mhahindi/files/pdf/Eighth_Schedule.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; there are demands for inclusion of 42 more languages
in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. These are:

An '''elizate''' ({{IPA-eu|elis̻ate}}), ({{lang-es|anteiglesia}}) is an early form of local government in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] which was particularly common in [[Biscay]] but also existed in the other provinces. The terms '''elizate''' (in [[Standard Basque]]) and '''elexate''' (in [[Biscayan dialect|Biscayan]]) literally translate as "church door" (''eliza'' "church" + ''ate'' "door"). The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term ''anteiglesia'' translates as "before [the] church".

The peculiar name derives from the Basque custom where the family heads of a settlement connected to a particular [[parish]] would gather after mass at the entrance or portico of the church to make decisions regarding issues affecting their community. Their medieval history is closely linked to the emergence of the ''Batzar Nagusiak'' or "Grand Meetings", especially those of Biscay and [[Gipuzkoa]] (''[[Juntas Generales]] de Vizcaya/Guipúzcoa'' in Spanish) and the establishment of parochial churches. Each ''elizate'' would elect a representative who would represent the ''elizate'' at a ''Batzar Nagusia'', so the ''elizate'' represents an early form of local democracy. These enjoyed considerable autonomy in decision-making from the higher administrative authorities.
[[Image:BedonaArrasate.JPG|thumb|right|The ''elizate'' of Bedoña near [[Arrasate]] which was only incorporated into a municipality in the 1960s]]

An ''elizate'' was steered by a ''fiel sindiko'' (''fiel síndico'' in Spanish), who would organise meetings and bear a [[makila]] as a sign of authority. A ''fiel'' was normally chosen for one year through a number of methods. Some were nominated by the outgoing ''fiel'', in some places the position of ''fiel'' would rotate through all farmholders of the ''elizate'' and in others the most recently married farmholder would be named ''fiel''. Each ''elizate'' was subdivided into smaller units called ''kofradiak'' (''cofradías'' in Spanish, "brotherhoods") which corresponded to the individual boroughs of an ''elizate''.

A group of elizates was a ''[[merindad]]''.

Through time ''elizates'' often became municipalities. In Biscay, during the time of the [[Basque señoríos|Lordship of Biscay]] (''Bizkaiko Jaurerria'' in Basque, ''Señorío de Vizcaya'' in Spanish), the territory of all ''anteiglesias'' were referred to as Plain Land (''[[Lur Laua]]'' in Basque, ''Tierra Llana'' in Spanish), as opposed to the more stratified cities. It was further incorporated into the administration. They became subject to the [[fuero]]s which at the same time re-affirmed the status of nobility to all farmholders. This meant that unlike in most of [[feudal]] Europe, the farmers legally owned their land.

After centuries of political change, very few ''elizate'' remain today, two of the most notable in [[Iurreta]] and [[Derio]]. In 1962, in [[Francoist Spain]], the name of the ''elizates'' was changed to ''auzo'' (neighbourhood, district) and they were merged into municipalities. The current term, ''auzo'', is undistinguishable from the subdivisions of a city, which are called by the same term.

In [[linguistics]], in the study of [[syntax]], an '''empty category''' is an element that does not have any phonological content and is therefore unpronounced.&lt;ref name="Kosta_and_Krivochen"&gt;Kosta, Peter, and Krivochen, Diego Gabriel. ''Eliminating Empty Categories: A Radically Minimalist View on Their Ontology and Justification''. Frankfurt: Peter Lang GmbH, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Empty categories may also be referred to as '''covert categories''', in contrast to overt categories which are pronounced.&lt;ref name="Kosta_and_Krivochen"/&gt; The phenomenon was named by [[Noam Chomsky]] in his 1981 [[Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures|LGB]] framework.&lt;ref name="Kosta_and_Krivochen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lectures on Government and Binding|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|publisher=Foris|year=1981|isbn=9070176130|location=Dordrecht, Netherlands|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some empty categories are governed by the [[empty category principle]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. When representing empty categories in trees, linguists use a null symbol to depict the idea that there is a mental category at the level being represented, even if the word(s) are being left out of overt speech. 

Empty categories come in two major types: null DP's and null heads. These major categories can be broken down further: 

1) There are four main types of null DP's: NP-trace, WH-trace, PRO, and ''pro''.  The types are differentiated by their two [[binding (linguistics)|binding]] features: the [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] feature [a] and the [[Pronoun|pronominal]] feature [p]. The four possible interactions of plus or minus values for these features yield the four types of null DP's.&lt;ref&gt;Kosta, Peter. “Empty Categories, Null-Subjects and Null-Objects and How to Treat Them in the Minimalist Program.” Linguistics in Potsdam 2.3 (1995/1996): 7-38. Web. 6 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

In the table, [+a] refers to the [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] feature, meaning that the particular element must be bound within its governing category. [+p] refers to the pronominal feature which shows that the empty category is taking the place of an overt pronoun. Having a negative value for a specific feature indicates that a particular type of null DP is ''not'' subject to the requirements of the feature. 

2) There are many types of null heads, including null determiners, null complementizers, and null tense. All null heads are the result of some movement operation on the underlying structure, forcing a lexical item out of its original position.  

Empty categories are present in most of the world's languages, although different languages allow for different categories to be empty.

== Generation ==
Not all empty categories enter the derivation of a sentence at the same point. Both DP-trace and WH-trace, as well as all of the null heads, are only generated as the result of [[transformation (linguistics)|movement]] operations. Trace refers to the syntactic position which is left after something has moved, helping to explain how DP-trace and WH-trace get their names.&lt;ref name="Kosta_and_Krivochen"/&gt; What is meant by "trace" is that there is a position in the sentence that holds syntactic content in the [[deep structure]], but that has undergone movement so that it is not present at the surface, or S-structure. Conversely, both "PRO" and "''pro"'' are not the result of movement and must be generated in the underlying structure. &lt;ref name="Kosta_and_Krivochen"/&gt; In both the [[Government and binding theory|government and binding]] and [[Minimalist program|minimalism]] frameworks, the only method of base-generation is lexical insertion. This means that both "PRO" and "''pro"'' are held to be entries in the mental [[lexicon]], whereas DP-trace and Wh-trace, and the null heads are not categories in the lexicon.

== Four types of null DPs: the classical theory ==

=== PRO (Big Pro) ===
[[File:He would like to stay - PRO.png|thumb|This example shows "PRO" in the subject position of the embedded clause, and co-referenced to [He].]]
{{Main|PRO (linguistics)}}

The empty category subclass called PRO, referred to as "big pro" when speaking&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, is a DP which appears in a caseless position.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=9781118321881|edition=3|volume=19|location=West Sussex|pages=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; PRO is a universal lexical element, it is said to be able to occur in every language, and helps to account for non-finite embedded clauses.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, it's occurrence is limited: PRO ''must'' occupy the specifier position of an embedded, non-finite clause&lt;ref name="Huang, C 1989"&gt;Huang, C.-T.J. "PRO-drop in Chinese". ''The Null Subject Parameter''(1989):185. Web. 11 Nov 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;, such as in the example below:&lt;br /&gt;

This example does not use PRO, but instead, uses an overt pronoun ("you") in the specifier position of the embedded non-finite clause:
     1a) ''He&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; would like you&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; to stay.''

This example does use PRO, because instead of an overt pronoun, there is an empty category which is [[Coreference|co-referenced]] with "He", appearing in the specifier position of the non-finite embedded clause:
     1b) ''He&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; would like PRO&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to stay.''

The example tree to the right is the tree structure for this sentence, [He&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; would like PRO&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; to stay], and shows PRO surfacing in the specifier position of the TP in the embedded clause, and co-referenced to (referring to the same being as) the subject of the matrix clause. We can interpret this as the DP subject [He] having control over PRO. In other words, the meaning of PRO is determined by the meaning of DP [He] -- they are co-referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=9781118321881|edition=3|volume=19|pages=443}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of a subject control construction, where the pronominal subject [He] is selected for by both the main verb [like] and the embedded infinitive verb [stay], thus forcing the introduction of an unpronounced lexical item (PRO) at the subject of the embedded clause, in order to fulfil the selectional requirements of both verbs.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Syntactic Analysis and Theory|last=Sportiche|first=Dominique|last2=Koopman|first2=Hilda|last3=Stabler|first3=Edward|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=9781405100175|location=Chichester, West Sussex|pages=240-244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, we see object control constructions when the object of the sentence controls the meaning of PRO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=9781118321881|edition=3|volume=19|pages=430}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, while the meaning of PRO can be determined by its controller (here, the subject of the matrix clause), it does not have to be. PRO can either be controlled ("[[Control (linguistics)|obligatory control]]") or uncontrolled ("[[Control (linguistics)#Non-obligatory or optional control|optional control]]").&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=9781118321881|edition=3|volume=19|pages=446-447}}&lt;/ref&gt; The realization that PRO does not behave exactly like an R-Expression, an anaphor, or a pronoun (it is in fact, simultaneously an anaphor and a pronoun&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Blackwell Companion to Syntax|last=Ambar|first=Manuela|last2=Jiménez‐Fernández|first2=Ángel L.|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2017|isbn=|editor-last=Everaert|editor-first=M.|edition=2|location=Chichester, West Sussex|pages=17-18|editor-last2=van Riemsdijk|editor-first2=H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) led to the conclusion that it must be a category in and of itself. It can sometimes be bound, is sometimes co-referenced in the sentence, and does not fit into [[binding (linguistics)|binding theory]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Note that in modern theories, embedded clauses that introduce PRO as a subject are CPs. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ussery|first=Cherlon|last2=Ding|first2=Lydia|last3=Liu|first3=Yining Rebecca|date=2016|title=The typology of Mandarin infinitives|url=https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/PLSA/article/view/3727|journal=Proceedings of the Linguistic Society of America|volume=1:28|pages=1-15|via=Public Knowledge Project Open Journal Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''pro'' (little pro) ===
"Little pro" occurs in a subject position of a [[Finite verb|finite]] clause and has case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=9781118321881|edition=3|volume=19|pages=450}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DP is ‘dropped’ from a sentence if its reference can be recovered from the context; ''"pro"'' is the silent counterpart of an overt pronoun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Syntactic Analysis and Theory|last=Sportiche|first=Dominique|last2=Koopman|first2=Hilda|last3=Stabler|first3=Edward|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=9781405100175|location=Chichester, West Sussex|pages=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish is an example of a language with rich subject-verb [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] that can allow null subjects. The agreement-marking on the verb in Spanish allows the subject to be identified even if the subject is absent from the spoken form of the sentence. This does not happen in English because the agreement-markings in English are not sufficient for a listener to be able to deduce the meaning of a missing referent. &lt;ref name="Huang, C 1989" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Richard. "Pronominal and Null Subject Variation in Spanish: Constraints, Dialects, and Functional Compensation." Order No. 9227631 University of Pennsylvania, 1992. Ann Arbor: ProQuest. Web. 28 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese is an example of a [[pro-drop language]], where both subjects and objects can be dropped from the pronounced part of [[Finite verb|finite]] sentences, and their meaning remains clear from the context. In pro-drop languages, the covert "pro" is allowed to replace all overt pronouns, resulting in the grammaticality of sentences that do not have a subject nor object that is overtly pronounced: 

This example illustrates how a Chinese question might be asked with Zhangsan as the subject and Lisi as the object:&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Huang, C.-T.J. "PRO-drop in Chinese". ''The Null Subject Parameter''(1989):187. Web. 11 Nov 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

 2a) ''Zhangsan kanjian Lisi   le   ma?''
     Zhangsan see     Lisi   ASP  Q?
    ‘Did Zhangsan see Lisi?’

Below is an example of a response to the question above. Both subject and object are optionally pronounced categories. The meaning of the sentence can be easily recovered, even though the pronouns are dropped. (Round brackets indicate an optional element.)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

 2b)''(ta) kanjian (ta) le.''
    (He) saw     (him).

The same point can be made with overt pronouns in English, as in the sentence “John said I saw him”. Where the chance of picking [John] as the antecedent for [him] is clearly greater than that of picking any other person.

In example 3), the null object must be referring to the matrix clause subject [Zhangsan] but not the embedded subject [Lisi], since [[Binding (linguistics)#The traditional binding theory: Conditions A, B, and C|condition C]] of the [[Binding Theory]] states that it must be free. (Square brackets indicate that an element is covert (not pronounced), as in the second English translation.)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

 3)''Zhangsan shuo Lisi hen xihuan.''
   Zhangsan say  Lisi very like.
  'Zhangsan said that Lisi liked [him].'

=== DP-trace  '''(t&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt;)''' ===

[[File:Cheri seems to like Tony - DP TRACE.png|thumb|This example shows the movement of DP [Cheri] from the specifier position of the embedded infinitive clause to the specifier position of the TP in the matrix clause.]]

In certain syntactic environments (e.g. specifier VP and the specifier position of a TP which introduces a non-finite verb), case features are unable to be “checked”, and a [[determiner phrase]] must move throughout the phrase structure in order to check the case features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=9781118321881|edition=3|volume=19|location=West Sussex|pages=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this happens, a movement rule is initiated, and the structure is altered so that we hear the DP overtly pronounced in the position of the sentence which it has been moved to; a DP-trace is an empty category that appears at the original spot (the underlying position) of the DP, and stands for the syntactic space in the tree that the DP previously occupied&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brody|first=Micheal|date=Autumn 2018|title=On the Complementary Distribution of Empty Categories|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4178456?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|volume=16:4|pages=506|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;. DP-trace is found in complementary distribution to PRO&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Underlying word order in the sentence "Cheri seems to like Tony."
 4a) ''[  ] seems Cheri to like Tony.''

Spoken form of the sentence "Cheri seems to like Tony."
 4b) ''Cheri seems [  t&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; ] to like Tony.''
&lt;sub&gt;*Square brackets throughout example 4 indicate an empty DP category&lt;/sub&gt;

This English example shows that DP [Cheri] is originally introduced in the [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]] position of the embedded infinitive clause, before moving to the specifier position of the matrix clause. This movement happens in order to check the features of the [[raising verb]] [seem]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Syntactic Analysis and Theory|last=Sportiche|first=Dominique|last2=Koopman|first2=Hilda|last3=Stabler|first3=Edward|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=9781405100175|location=Chichester, West Sussex|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and leaves behind a DP-trace (tDP) in the original position of the DP. You can use the position of the DP-trace to identify where the DP is introduced in the [[underlying structure]].  

=== WH-trace ===

[[File:WH-trace.png|thumb|This example shows the movement of "WH" DP [who] from the complement position of the verb to the specifier position of CP.]]

DPs can move for another reason: in the case of Wh-questions. In English, these are questions that begin with &lt;wh&gt; (e.g. who/whom, what, when, where, why, which, and how); words that serve the same function in other languages do not necessarily begin with &lt;wh&gt;, but are still treated as “Wh-items” under this framework. The responses to these questions cannot be yes or no; they must be answered using informative phrases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=9781118321881|edition=3|volume=19|location=West Sussex|pages=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wh-items undergo Wh-movement to the specifier of CP, leaving a Wh-trace (tWH) in its original position. Just like for DP-movement, this movement is the result of feature checking, this time, to check the [+WH] feature in C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=9781118321881|edition=3|volume=19|location=West Sussex|pages=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

To form a Wh-question in the example below, the DP [who] moves to the specifier of the CP position, leaving a Wh-trace in its original position. Due to the extended projection principle, there is DP movement to the specifier of TP position. There is also T to C movement, with the addition of Do-support. These additional movement operations are not shown in the given example, for simplicity. 

Example 5: Underlying order of words in the sentence “Who did Lucy see?” (Square brackets throughout example 5 indicate an empty category.)
 5a) ''[  ] did Lucy see who''

Spoken form of the sentence "Who did Lucy see?"
 4b) ''Who did Lucy see [  t&lt;sub&gt;WH&lt;/sub&gt; ]?''

&lt;sub&gt;*Square brackets throughout example 5 indicate an empty category.&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;sub&gt;*You can see where "Who" was in the initial word order by where the WH-Trace appears in the spoken form.&lt;/sub&gt;

The tree to the right illustrates this example of WH-trace. Initially, the sentence is "[CP] did Lucy see who,” which has an empty specifier position of CP, as indicated by square brackets. After the Wh-item [who] is relocated to the specifier position of CP, the empty position is left at the end, in the original position of [who]. What is left in its place is the WH-trace.

A special relationship holds between the WH-item and the complementizer of a sentence:

  5a) ''[&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; The person [&lt;sub&gt;CP&lt;/sub&gt; who Ø&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;TP&lt;/sub&gt;likes Max]]] is here.''

  5b) ''[&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; The person [&lt;sub&gt;CP&lt;/sub&gt; t&lt;sub&gt;WH&lt;/sub&gt; that [&lt;sub&gt;TP&lt;/sub&gt;likes Max]]] is here.''

  5c) ''* [&lt;sub&gt;DP&lt;/sub&gt; The person [&lt;sub&gt;CP&lt;/sub&gt; t&lt;sub&gt;WH&lt;/sub&gt; Ø&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;TP&lt;/sub&gt;likes Max]]] is here.''

In this example, the complementizer or the WH-item can have null categories, and one or the other may show up as null. However, they cannot both be null when the WH-item is the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Sobin, Nicolas. ''Syntactic Analysis: The Basics''. West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

An important note to remember is that DP-trace and WH-trace are the result of movement operations, while "pro" and "PRO" must be base generated.&lt;ref name="Kosta_and_Krivochen"/&gt;

== Types of null heads ==
Not only can DPs be empty; [[Syntactic category|functional categories]] can be empty as well. Null [[determiner]]s and null [[complementizer]]s are empty categories that are the result of more recent research. These null heads are positions which end up being unpronounced at the surface level but are not included in the anaphoric and pronominal features chart that accounts for other types of empty categories.

===Null determiners===
[[File:Null determiners.svg|thumb|A null symbol is in the head position of DP because the pronoun “He” cannot have a determiner adjacent to it.|right]]
Null [[determiner]]s are used mainly when the [[Theta role|Theta]] assignment of a verb only allows an option for a DP as a phrase category in the sentence (with no option for an NP). [[Proper nouns]] and pronouns cannot grammatically have a determiner attached to them, though they still are part of the DP phrase.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Carnie, Andrew. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=or-Y3c9dY4UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Syntax: A Generative Introduction]''. West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, one needs to include a null category to stand as the D of the phrase as its head. Since a DP phrase has a determiner as its head, but one can end up with NPs that are not preceded by an overt determiner, a null symbol is used to represent the null determiner at the beginning of the DP.

Examples of nouns that do not need a determiner:
 [&lt;small&gt;DP&lt;/small&gt;Ø Andrew]

 [&lt;small&gt;DP&lt;/small&gt;Ø she]

The null determiners are subdivided into the same classes as overt determiners are, since the different null determiners are thought to appear in different grammatical contexts:&lt;ref&gt;Carnie, Andrew. [https://books.google.com/books?id=or-Y3c9dY4UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Syntax: A Generative Introduction]. West Sussex: Wiley-Blackwell, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ø&lt;sub&gt;[+PROPER]&lt;/sub&gt;
 NP&lt;sub&gt;[+PROPER,-PRONOUN]&lt;/sub&gt;

Ø&lt;sub&gt;[,+PRONOUN]&lt;/sub&gt;
 NP&lt;sub&gt;[-PLURAL, -PROPER, +PRONOUN]&lt;/sub&gt;

Ø&lt;sub&gt;[+PLURAL]&lt;/sub&gt;
 NP&lt;sub&gt;[+PLURAL, -PROPER, -PRONOUN]&lt;/sub&gt;

=== Null complementizers ===

Complementizerless environments (phrases which lack an overt C element) have often been attested in cross-linguistic data. In many cases, the complementizer is optionally present in a phrase:

In the following example, round brackets represent an optional element. In example (b), the optional element has been left out, leaving the C position empty. 
6a) She thinks (that) the cat is cute.
 b) She thinks Ø the cat is cute.

The existence of null complementizers is a phenomena that is currently still under debate in the linguistics community. There are two major theories that attempt to account for complementizerless environments: the CP Hypothesis and the IP Hypothesis. 

The '''CP Hypothesis''' states that finite subordinate clauses that lack an overt C at the surface level contain a CP layer that projects an empty (or unpronounced) C head.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kishimoto|first=Hideki|date=Spring 2006|title=On the Existence of Null Complementizers in Syntax|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4179369|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|edition=2|volume=37|pages=340|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some evidence for this claim arises from cross-linguistic analyses of yes/no question formation, where the phenomenon of [[Subject–auxiliary inversion|subject-auxiliary inversion]] (utilized in English) appears in complementary distribution with an overt complementizer question marker (for example, in Irish). Such work suggests that these are not two distinct mechanisms for yes/no question formation, but instead, that a subject-object inversion construction simply contains a special type of silent question marked complementizer. This claim is further supported by the fact that English does exhibit one environment — namely, embedded questions — that utilizes the overt question marked C “if”, and that these phrases do not employ subject-auxiliary inversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2012|isbn=9781118321881|location=West Sussex|pages=216-219}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to this, some compelling data from the Kansai dialect of Japanese, in which the same adverb can evoke different meaning depending on where it is attached in a clause, also points towards the existence of a Null C. For example, in both complementizerless and complementizer environments, the adverbial particle ''dake'' (“only”) evokes the same phrasal meaning:&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kishimoto|first=Hideki|date=Spring 2006|title=On the Existence of Null Complementizers in Syntax|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4179369|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|edition=2|volume=37|pages=341-342|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 7a) Adverbial ''dake'' (“only”) attached to complementizer:&lt;br /&gt;
  John-wa   [Mary-ga   okot-ta        tte-dake] yuu-ta. 
 John-ToP   Mary-NOM  get.angry-PAST that-only say-P  
 ‘John said only that Mary got angry.'

 7b) Averbial ''dake'' (“only”) attached to complementizerless phrase:&lt;br /&gt;
  John-wa  [Mary-ga   okot-ta        dake] yuu-ta.  
 John-TOP  Mary-NOM  get.angry-PAST only  say-PAsT  
 'John said only Mary got angry.'
The interpretation of both (a) and (b) is as follows: “among a number of things that John might have said, John said only that Mary got angry”
 7c) Adverbial ''dake'' (“only”) attached to tense:&lt;br /&gt;
 John-wa  [Mary-ga   okot-ta-dake        tte]  yuu-ta. 
 John-ToP  Mary-NOM  get.angry-PAST-only that  say 
 'John said that it is only the case that Mary got angry.'
The interpretation of (c) is as follows: “John said that among a number of people that might have gotten angry, only Mary did.”

   As demonstrated by (c), the adverb should evoke a different meaning than in (a) if it is attached to any item other than C. Because (a) and (b) yield the same interpretation, this suggests that the adverbial particle must be attached at the same spot in both clauses. In (a), the adverb dake is clearly attached to C; so even in the complementizerless environment (b), the adverb dake must still attach to C, thus pointing to the existence of a null complementizer in this phrase.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;


The '''IP Hypothesis''', on the other hand, asserts that the complementizer layer is simply nonexistent in overtly complementizerless clauses.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Literature arguing for this hypothesis is based upon the fact that there are some syntactic environments under which a null C head would violate the rules of government under the Empty Category Principle, and thus should be disallowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Syntax of Nonfinite Complementation: An Economy Approach|last=Boskovic|first=Zeljko|publisher=MIT Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Massachusetts|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doherty|first=Cathal|date=2009|title=Clauses without complementizers: Finite IP-complementation in English|url=|journal=The Linguistic Review|volume=14|issue=3|pages=197-220|doi=|via=De Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other work focusses on some differences in grammatical adjunction possibilities to “that” versus “that-less” clauses in English, for which the CP Hypothesis apparently cannot account. It states that under the CP Hypothesis, both clauses are CPs and thus should display the same adjunction possibilities; this is not what we find in the data. Instead, disparities in grammaticality emerge in environments of topicalization and adverbial adjunction.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The IP Hypothesis is said to make up for the shortcomings of the CP hypothesis in these domains. 

However, while both hypothesis possess some strong arguments, they also both have some crucial shortcomings. Further research is needed in order to concretely establish a more widely agreed-upon theory. 

== Questions of acquisition and other possible applications ==
One of the main questions that arises in linguistics when examining grammatical concepts is how children learn them. For empty categories, this is a particularly interesting consideration, since, when children ask for a certain object, their guardians usually respond in “[[Baby talk|motherese]]”. An example of a motherese utterance which doesn't use empty categories is in response to a child’s request for a certain object. A parent might respond “You want what?” instead of “What do you want?”.&lt;ref name="Villiers, Jill 2013"&gt;de Villiers, Jill. "[http://people.umass.edu/roeper/611/devilliers%20wh-%2003,%20.pdf Empty categories and complex sentences: the case of wh-questions]." People Umass. N.p., n.d. Web. 6 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sentence, the wh-word doesn't move, and so in the sentence that the child hears, there is no wh-trace. Possible explanations for the eventual [[Language acquisition|acquisition]] of the notion of empty categories are that the child then learns that even when he or she doesn't hear a word in the original position, they assume one is still there, because they are used to hearing a word.

At the beginning of acquisition, children do not have a concrete concept of an empty category; it is simply a weaker version of the concept. It is noted that  ‘[[Theta role|thematic government]]’ may be all the child possesses at a young age and this is enough to recognize the concept of empty category. The proper amount of time must be given to learn the certain aspects of an empty category ([[Grammatical case|case marking]], [[Generalized quantifier|monotonicity properties]], etc.).&lt;ref name="Villiers, Jill 2013"/&gt;

'''Engineering fits''' are generally used as part of [[geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] when a part or assembly is designed. In engineering terms, the "fit" is the clearance between two mating parts, and the size of this clearance determines whether the parts can move independently from each other, or are then temporarily or even permanently joined. Engineering fits are generally described as a "shaft and hole" but are not limited to just round components. [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] is the internationally accepted standard for defining engineering fits, but [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] is often still used in North America.

ISO and ANSI both group fits into three categories: clearance, location or transition, and interference. Within each category are several codes to define the size limits of the hole or shaft - the combination of which determines the type of fit. A fit is usually selected at the design stage according to whether the mating parts need to be accurately located, free to slide or rotate, separated easily, or resist separation. Cost is also a major factor in selecting a fit, as more accurate fits will be more expensive to produce, and tighter fits will be more expensive to assemble.

==ISO system of limits and fits==

=== Overview ===
The [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organisation for Standardization]] system splits the three main categories into several individual fits based on the allowable limits for hole and shaft size. Each fit is allocated a code, made up of a number and a letter, which is used on engineering drawings in place of upper &amp; lower size limits to reduce clutter in detailed areas.

=== Hole and shaft basis ===
A fit is either specified as shaft-basis or hole-basis, depending on which part has its size controlled to determine the fit. To elaborate: in a hole-basis system, the size of the hole remains constant and it is the diameter of the shaft that is varied to determine the fit; conversely in a shaft-basis system, the size of shaft remains constant and the hole diameter is varied to determine the fit.

The ISO system uses an alpha-numeric code to illustrate the tolerance ranges for the fit, with the upper-case representing the hole tolerance and lower-case representing the shaft. For example, in H7/h6 (a commonly-used fit) H7 represents the tolerance range of the hole and h6 represents the tolerance range of the shaft. These codes can be used by machinists or engineers to quickly identify the upper and lower size limits for either the hole or shaft. The potential range of clearance or interference can be found by subtracting the smallest shaft diameter from the largest hole, and largest shaft from the smallest hole.

=== Types of fit ===
The three types of fit are:
# Clearance - the hole is larger than the shaft, enabling the two parts to slide and / or rotate when assembled. 
# Location / transition - the hole is fractionally smaller than the shaft and mild force is required to assemble / disassemble 
# Interference - the hole is smaller than the shaft and high force and / or heat is required to assemble / disassemble

== ANSI fit classes (USA Only) ==

=== Interference fits ===

{{main|Interference fit}}

''Interference Fits
', also known as ''Press Fits'' or ''Friction Fits'', are fastenings between two parts in which the inner component is larger than the outer component. Achieving an interference fit requires applying force during assembly. After the parts are joined, the mating surfaces will feel pressure due to friction, and deformation of the completed assembly will be observed.

==== Force fits ====
''Force fits'' are designed to maintain a controlled pressure between mating parts, and are used where forces or torques are being transmitted through the joining point. Like interference fits, force fits are achieved by applying a force during component assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mott|first1=Robert|title=Machine Elements in Mechanical Design|publisher=Pearson|page=495|edition=Fifth|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cat more|Interference fit#Force}}
FN 1 to FN 5

==== Shrink fits ====

''Shrink fits'' serve the same purpose as force fits, but are achieved by heating one member to expand it while the other remains cool. The parts can then be easily put together with little  applied force, but after cooling and contraction, the same dimensional interference exists as for a force fit. Like force fits, shrink fits range from FN 1 to FN 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mott|first1=Robert|title=Machine Elements in Mechanical Design|publisher=Pearson|page=495|edition=Fifth|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cat more|Interference fit#Thermal expansion or contraction}}

=== Location fits ===

Location fits are for parts that do not normally move relative to each other.

==== Location interference fit ==== &lt;!-- The upper case N in interference is intentional to highlight the source and be a memory aid for the N in LN. --&gt;
LN 1 to LN 3  ( or LT 7 to LT 21? {{citation needed|date=January 2016}} )

==== Location transition fit ====
LT 1 to LT 6

==== Location clearance fit====
LC 1 to LC 11

=== RC fits ===
The smaller RC numbers have smaller clearances for tighter fits, the larger numbers have larger clearances for looser fits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobanengineering.com/Tolerances/ANSILimitsAndFits.asp|accessdate=9 September 2013|title=ANSI Standard Limits and Fits (ANSI B4.1-1967,R1974)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== RC1: close sliding fits ====

Fits of this kind are intended for the accurate location of parts which must assemble without noticeable play.

==== RC2: sliding fits ====

Fits of this kind are intended for the accurate location but with greater maximum clearance than class RC1. Parts made to this fit turn and move easily. This type is not designed for free run. Sliding fits in larger sizes may seize with small temperature changes due to little allowance for thermal expansion or contraction.

==== RC3: precision running fits ====

Fits of this kind are about the closest fits which can be expected to run freely. Precision fits are intended for precision work at low speed, low bearing pressures, and light journal pressures. RC3 is not suitable where noticeable temperature differences occur.

==== RC4: close running fits ====

Fits of this kind are mostly for running fits on accurate machinery with moderate surface speed, bearing pressures, and journal pressures where accurate location and minimum play are desired. Fits of this kind also can be described as smaller clearances with higher requirements for precision fit.

==== RC5 and R6: medium running fits ====

Fits of this kind are designed for machines running at higher running speeds, considerable bearing pressures, and heavy journal pressure. Fits of this kind also can be described with greater clearances with common requirements for fit precision.

==== RC7: free running fits ====

Fits of this kind are intended to use where accuracy is not essential. It is suitable for great temperature variations. This fit is suitable to use without any special requirements for precise guiding of shafts.

==== RC8 and RC9: loose running fits ====

This kind of fit is intended for use where wide commercial tolerances may be required on the shaft. With this fits, the parts with great clearances with having great tolerances. Loose running fits exposed to effects of corrosion, contamination by dust and thermal or mechanical deformations.

'''''English Journal''''' (previously '''''The English Journal''''') is the official publication of the Secondary Education section of the American [[National Council of Teachers of English]]. The [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal has been published since 1912 and features columns and articles on all aspects of the teaching of English language arts at middle schools and junior and senior high schools.

In 1939, the journal ''[[College English]]'' was spun off from ''The English Journal'' to address the needs of teaching English language arts at the college level.

Currently (2016), the journal's editor is Dr. Julie A. Gorlewski of [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]. Its content is accessible electronically via [[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]], [[ProQuest]], and [[JSTOR]], and is indexed by the [[Modern Language Association|MLA]].

Regular features include articles on [[pedagogy]], [[literature]], [[English language learner|ELL]] issues, and [[education]]al [[technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Palmeri|first1=Jason|last2=McCorkle|first2=Ben|date=2017-01-15|title=A Distant View of English Journal, 1912-2012|url=http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/22.2/topoi/palmeri-mccorkle/index.html|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal also accepts poetry submissions.

{{Dutch dialects}}

'''French Flemish''' (French Flemish: ''Fransch vlaemsch'', [[Dutch language|Standard Dutch]]: ''Frans-Vlaams'', {{lang-fr|flamand français}}) is a [[West Flemish]] dialect spoken in the north of contemporary France. Place names attest to Flemish having been spoken since the 8th century in the area that was ceded to France in the 17th century and which became known as [[French Flanders]]. Its dialect subgroup, called French Flemish, meanwhile, became a minority dialect that survives mainly in [[Dunkirk]] (''Duinkerke'' in Dutch/''Duunkerke'' in West Flemish = dune church), [[Bourbourg]] (''Broekburg'' in Dutch), [[Calais]] (''Kales''), [[Saint-Omer]] (''Sint-Omaars'') with an [[ethnic enclave]] Haut-Pont (''Haute-Ponte'') known for its predominantly Flemish community {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and [[Bailleul, Nord|Bailleul]] (''Belle'')&lt;!--around [[Hazebrouck]] and [[Cassel]]--&gt;. French-Flemish has about 20,000 daily users, and twice that number of occasional speakers. The language's status appears to be moribund,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Education ==
A growing, re-introduced language, French Flemish is taught in several schools in the [[Westhoek (region)|French Westhoek]]. The ANVT-ILRF was given permission to carry out experimental lessons in four public schools (in [[Esquelbecq]], [[Noordpeene]], [[Volckerinckhove]], [[Wormhout]]) for the school years of 2007–08 until 2010–11, after which it would be evaluated. Afterwards, all requirements were met but it was only allowed to continue them, but not to expand to other schools or to the ''[[collège]]''. On the other hand, the private Catholic education began teaching Dutch in collèges in [[Gravelines]] and [[Hondschoote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/Locales/Dunkerque/actualite/Autour_de_Dunkerque/Littoral_Flandre/2011/09/01/article_le-flamand-fait-son-entree-dans-deux-col.shtml|title=Le flamand fait son entrée dans deux collèges du Dunkerquois|date=1 September 2011|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
Though generally seen as a dialect of Dutch, some of its speakers prefer to call it a [[regional language]]. Jean-Paul Couché, chairman of the ''Akademie voor Nuuze Vlaemsche Taele'' (ANVT), argues:&lt;ref name=today/&gt;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Linguistically, a dialect depends on a larger, national language. That does not apply to French Flemish. We are not connected to standard Dutch because it is an artificial language that was created based on the dialects of North Holland. Research shows that the distance between French Flemish and Dutch is greater than that between Dutch and German.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

'''Geoffrey H. Hartman''' (August 11, 1929 – March 14, 2016) was a German-born&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Forward]] |last=Balint |first=Benjamin |title=From Frankfurt to New Haven |date=May 22, 2008 |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/13426/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[literary theorist]], sometimes identified with the [[Yale School of deconstruction]], although he cannot be categorised by a single school or method. Hartman spent most of his career in the comparative literature department at [[Yale University]], where he also founded the [[Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies]].

==Biography==
Geoffrey H. Hartmann was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], in an [[Ashkenazi]] [[Jewish]] family.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt; In 1939 he left Germany for England as an unaccompanied ''[[Kindertransport]]'' child refugee, sent away by his family to escape the Nazi regime.  He came to the United States in 1946, where he was reunited with his mother, and later became an American citizen. Upon arrival in the US, his mother changed the family surname to "Hartman" to obscure its Germanic origin.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

Hartman attended [[Queens College, City University of New York]] and received his PhD from Yale. After appointments at the [[University of Iowa]] and [[Cornell University|Cornell]] in the 1950s, Hartman returned to Yale and was eventually made [[Sterling Professor]] of English and Comparative Literature at [[Yale University]]. One of his long-term interests was the [[England|English]] poet [[William Wordsworth]].

His work explores the nature of the creative imagination, as well as the interrelationship of literature and literary commentary.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ContempAuthors"&gt;"Geoffrey H. Hartman." ''Contemporary Authors Online''. Detroit: Gale, 2016. Retrieved via ''Biography in Context'' database, 17 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; He helped found the [[Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies]] at Yale's [[Sterling Memorial Library]], and lectured on issues dealing with the production and implications of testimony.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2084">'''Gert Vlok Nel''' ([[Beaufort West]], 1963) is a [[South Africa]]n [[poet]]. He studied English, Afrikaans and history at [[Stellenbosch University]] and worked as a guide, a bartender and a watchman. He has published one collection of poems, ''Om te lewe is onnatuurlik'' (To live is unnatural), for which he received the [[Ingrid Jonker Prize]] in 1994. His countryman [[Etienne van Heerden]] praised Vlok Nel as 'one of our finest talents'.&lt;ref&gt;http://southafrica.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=428&lt;/ref&gt;

''Om te lewe is onnatuurlik'' was followed by a CD, ''Beaufort Wes se beautiful woorde'', an autobiographical sketch and a full-length show with poems, songs and visual material, which he has performed all over South Africa. Some people say{{Who|date=February 2010}} he is a travelling bard with a guitar, comparable to [[Bob Dylan]] and the South African troubadour [[Koos du Plessis]]. He himself says he admires [[Tom Waits]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]] (‘Tom Waits, he messes about, just like me’).

In his début collection, Vlok Nel paints a personal portrait of his childhood in [[Beaufort West]], a rural part of South Africa with a predominantly poor-white population. His father was a railway employee.

Vlok Nel writes his lyrics in an unusual and innovative Afrikaans, comparable with, if anything, the language experiments of Antjie Krog.

The Dutch poet [[Gerrit Komrij]] included eight of Vlok Nel's poems in his anthology of South African poetry in Afrikaans ''De Afrikaanse poëzie in 1000 en enige gedichten''.

Gert's re-released album entered the Dutch charts at number 59 in 2006.

'''Günter Abel''' (born 7 November 1947 in [[Homberg (Efze)]], [[Hesse]]) is a German [[philosopher]]. Since 1987 he has been professor for theoretical philosophy at the [[Technical University of Berlin]].

Abel studied [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[romance studies]] and [[political science]] at the  [[University of Marburg]] and the [[University of Lausanne]]. After finishing his PhD thesis on [[stoicism]] Abel [[Habilitation|habilitated]] in 1981 with a work on [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Since 1987 he is professor for theoretical philosophy at the [[Technical University of Berlin]]. From 1999 to 2001 he was vice-president of the  [[Technical University of Berlin]], from 2002 to 2005 he was president of the German Society of Philosophy (DGPhil). Since 2008 he is board member of the [[International Federation of Philosophical Societies]] (FISP, Fédération Internationale des Sociétés de Philosophie).

Abel developed the so-called "general philosophy of sign and interpretation", which holds that [[language]], [[thought|thinking]], [[Action theory (philosophy)|action]] and [[knowledge]] are fundamentally tied to the practice of interpretation and use of signs. All aspects of life, from [[perception]] to [[Introspection|reflection]] to [[Action theory (philosophy)|action]], are characterised as interpretative and constructional and constituted by signs. [[Reality]] thus depends on systems of description, symbols and interpretations. Consequently, Abel holds that the idea of an uninterpreted reality turns out to be wrong. According to the constitutive role of interpretation he refers to "worlds of interpretation" (in reference to [[Nelson Goodman]]s "ways of worldmaking"). Based on this premise Abel advances a three-step model of relations of signs and interpretation, which he applies in different fields of philosophy.

He published about topics of [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], philosophy of knowledge and science ("knowledge research"), [[philosophy of language]], theory of symbols, [[philosophy of perception]], [[ethics]], theory of [[creativity]] and [[philosophy of art]].

Abel is a noted [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] scholar who tries to combine elements of Nietzsche's philosophy with methods of contemporary [[analytic philosophy]]. He focusses mainly on Nietzsche's epistemology, which had a strong influence on his own philosophy of interpretation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">In mathematics, '''Hopf conjecture''' may refer to one of several conjectural statements from [[differential geometry]] and [[topology]] attributed to either [[Eberhard Hopf]] or [[Heinz Hopf]].

== Positively curved Riemannian manifolds ==

: ''A compact, even-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] with positive [[sectional curvature]] has positive [[Euler characteristic]]'' 

For [[differential geometry of surfaces|surfaces]], this follows from the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]]. For [[4-manifold|four-dimensional manifolds]], this follows from the finiteness of the [[fundamental group]] and  [[Poincaré duality]]. The conjecture has been proved for manifolds of dimension 4''k''+2 or 4''k''+4 admitting an isometric [[torus action]] of a ''k''-dimensional torus and for manifolds ''M'' admitting an isometric action of a compact [[Lie group]] ''G'' with principal isotropy subgroup ''H'' and cohomogeneity ''k'' such that

: &lt;math&gt; k-(\operatorname{rank} G-\operatorname{rank} H)\leq 5. &lt;/math&gt; 

In a related conjecture, "positive" is replaced with "nonnegative".

== Riemannian symmetric spaces == 
: ''A compact [[symmetric space]] of rank greater than one cannot carry a Riemannian metric of positive sectional curvature.'' 

In particular, the four-dimensional manifold ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; should admit no [[Riemannian metric]] with positive sectional curvature.

== Aspherical manifolds ==
: ''Suppose M&lt;sup&gt;2k&lt;/sup&gt; is a closed, [[aspherical manifold]] of even dimension. Then its Euler characteristic satisfies the inequality''

:: &lt;math&gt; (-1)^k\chi(M^{2k})\geq 0. &lt;/math&gt; 

This topological version of Hopf conjecture for [[Riemannian manifold]]s is due to [[William Thurston]]. [[Ruth Charney]] and [[Michael Davis (mathematician)|Michael Davis]] conjectured that the same inequality holds for a nonpositively curved piecewise Euclidean (PE) manifold.

== Metrics with no  conjugate points==

: ''A Riemannian metric without conjugate points on n-dimensional torus is flat.''

This theorem was proved by Dmitri Burago and Sergei Ivanov.&lt;ref&gt;Dmitri Burago and Sergei Ivanov, ''Riemannian tori without conjugate points are flat'', [[Geometric and Functional Analysis]] '''4''' (1994), no. 3, 259-269, {{doi| 10.1007/BF01896241}}, {{MR|1274115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8437">A '''journal club''' is a group of individuals who meet regularly to critically evaluate recent articles in the [[academic literature]], such as the [[scientific literature]], [[medical literature]], or [[philosophy]] literature.  Journal clubs are usually organized around a defined subject in basic or applied research. For example, the application of [[evidence-based medicine]] to some area of medical practice can be facilitated by a journal club. Typically, each participant can voice their view relating to several questions such as the appropriateness of the research design, the [[statistics]] employed, the appropriateness of the controls that were used, etc.  There might be an attempt to synthesize together the results of several papers, even if some of these results might first appear to contradict each other.  Even if the results of the study are seen as valid, there might be a discussion of how useful the results are and if these results might lead to new research or to new applications.

Journal clubs are sometimes used in the education of [[graduate student|graduate]] or professional students. These help make the student(s) become more familiar with the advanced literature in their new field of study. In addition, these journal clubs help improve the students' skills of understanding and debating current topics of active interest in their field. This type of journal club may sometimes be taken for [[Credit (education)|credit]].  Research laboratories may also organize journal clubs for all researchers in the lab to help them keep up with the literature produced by others who work in their field.

== Traditional journal club ==
Traditionally, journal clubs have met weekly or monthly to discuss current research in a topic relevant to the field. An analysis of one hundred publications describing and evaluating journal clubs found that they are most effective if they have a clearly identified leader and have an established purpose that all articles can be linked to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2753.2008.01050.x/full|title=How to run an effective journal club: a systematic review|first1=Y.|last1=Deenadayalan|first2=K.|last2=Grimmer‐Somers|first3=M.|last3=Prior|first4=S.|last4=Kumar|date=1 October 2008|publisher=|journal=Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice|volume=14|issue=5|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2753.2008.01050.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online journal clubs ==
Prominent journals and scientific societies have began hosting online commenting features that they are referring to as journal clubs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedcommons/journal-clubs/about/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thoracic.org/members/assemblies/assemblies/srn/journal-club/|title=American Thoracic Society - SRN Journal Club|website=www.thoracic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated purpose of these is to allow for discussion by online comments on scientific publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pubmedcommonsblog.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2014/12/17/introducing-pubmed-commons-journal-clubs/|title=Protected Blog › Log in|website=pubmedcommonsblog.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Online journal clubs bring about different benefits to traditional clubs. While journal clubs have been an opportunity for students and trainees to gain experience presenting articles and addressing issues, with the online "journal club" comment format, authors are able to comment and reply to critiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pubmedcommonsblog.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2015/12/17/commenting-on-pubmed-a-successful-pilot/|title=Protected Blog › Log in|website=pubmedcommonsblog.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pubmedcommonsblog.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2017/07/05/collaborating-to-bring-journal-clubs-to-pubmed-commons-a-librarians-perspective/|title=Protected Blog › Log in|website=pubmedcommonsblog.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twitter-enhanced===
Journal clubs continue to adapt to new technology and methods of communication. Recently journal clubs have begun to take advantage of Twitter allowing geographically diverse groups to participate in a single discussion. The first Twitter Journal club was an Allergy Journal Club run by Dr. Ves Dimoz in 2008. They used Twitter to document the discussion of coverage of a traditional in-person journal club. This journal club established the use of hashtags to organize journal club comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://casesblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/first-journal-club-on-twitter-then-and.html|title = The First Journal Club on Twitter - Then and Now|date = June 8, 2011|accessdate = 2014-11-27|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bzlo36xvP22vYzQ3Yjk5M2EtYjhhMy00NjdjLTgxYTYtMTYxZDg2OGE4NmY1/edit?hl=en_US|title = Use of Social Media for Education|last = |first = |date = |journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first group to run a journal club primarily on Twitter was The Twitter Journal Club started by Natalie Silvey and Fi Douglas in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110620/full/474431a.html|title = Researchers tweet technical talk|date = 2011-06-20|accessdate = 2014-11-26|website = Nature.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj-journals-development-blog/2011/07/15/twitter-journal-club-yet-another-revolution-in-scientific-communication/|title = Twitter Journal Club: yet another ‘revolution’ in scientific communication?|date = 2011-06-15|accessdate = 2014-06-27|website = BMJ Blogs|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Twitter Journal Club appears to have gone offline. Since then there have been a number of additional Twitter journal clubs.

The earliest references to a journal club was found in a book of memoirs and letters by the late [[James Paget|Sir James Paget]], a British surgeon, who describes a group at [[St. Bartholomew's Hospital]] in [[London]] in the mid-19th century as "a kind of club ... a small room over a baker's shop near the Hospital-gate where we could sit and read the [[scientific journal|journals]]."&lt;ref&gt;Esisi, Martina. "Journal clubs." BMJ Careers. 13 October 2007. Web. 9 January 2010. &lt;http://careers.bmj.com/careers/advice/view-article.html?id=2631#ref2&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Osler|Sir William Osler]] established the first formalized journal club at [[McGill University]] in Montreal in 1875.  The original purpose of Osler's journal club was "for the purchase and distribution of [[periodical]]s to which he could ill afford to subscribe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=1065082 | pmid=15566599 | doi=10.1186/cc3005 | volume=8 | title=Evidence-based medicine journal club | year=2004 | journal=Crit Care | pages=401–2 | author=Milbrandt EB, Vincent JL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tinsley Harrison]], the famous creator of [[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]] hosted a journal club at his house twice a month where one member of the group would present a research paper and the others would criticize it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.doctorshangout.com/profiles/blogs/tinsley-randolph-harrison-the-founding-editor-harrisons-principle|title = Tinsley Randolph Harrison - The founding editor of Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|date = 2011-08-25|accessdate = |website = DoctorsHangout.com|publisher = |last = pittman|first = james}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62034">[[Kabardian language|'''Kabardian''']] is a [[Northwest Caucasian]] language with an [[ergative language|ergative]] verb-final clause structure.

==Ergative–absolutive==
Kabardian is an [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] language, which means that the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of an intransitive verb behaves like the [[Object (grammar)|object]] of a transitive verb, and differently from the agent of a transitive verb. Nouns in Kabardian can have the following roles in a sentence:
*Ergative case: Marked as -м /-m/, it serves to mark the one that causes change by doing the verb.
*Absolutive case: Marked as -р /-r/, it serves to mark the one that changes by the verb, i.e. it is being created, altered, moved or ended by the verb.
*Oblique case: Also marked as -м /-m/, it serves to mark the [[Dative case|dative]] and [[Applicative voice|applicative]] case roles. It acts as the indirect object in the sentence and its state doesn't change by the verb, i.e. we have no indication what happens to it or how it behaves after the verb.

In intransitive verbs the subject is in the absolutive case thus it indicates that the subject is changing.

*In this example the boy is changing by moving:
:{|
|-
|Щӏалэр || макӏо
|-
|Щӏалэ-р || макӏо
|-
|{{IPA|[ɕʼaːɮar}} || {{IPA|maːkʷʼa]}}
|-
| boy (abs.) || (s)he is going
|-
|colspan=2|"The boy is going."
|}

*In this example the man is changing by moving. The verb еуэн /jawan/ "to hit" describes the movement of hitting  and not the impact itself, so we have no indication of what happens to the object (the wall in this case).

:{|
|-
|Лӏыр|| дэпкъым || йоуэ
|-
|Лӏы-р|| дэпкъы-м || йоуэ
|-
|{{IPA|[ɬʼər}} || {{IPA|dapqəm}} || {{IPA|jowa]}}
|-
| man (abs.) || wall (obl.) || (s)he is hitting
|-
|colspan=3|"The man is hitting the wall."
|-
|colspan=3|"Literally: the man is hitting at the wall."
|}

In transitive verbs the subject is in the ergative case thus it indicates that the subject causes change to the object which gets the absolutive case.

*In this example the wall changes by being destroyed (it was altered). The verb къутэн /qʷətan/ "to destroy" does not indicate how the subject (boy) destroyed the wall thus we have no indication of the boy changing, making him the one that caused the change (and not the one that changes).

:{|
|-
| Щӏалэм || дэпкъыр || икъутащ
|-
| Щӏалэ-м || дэпкъы-р || ыкъутагъ
|-
|{{IPA|[ɕʼaːɮam}} || {{IPA|dapqər}} || {{IPA|jəqʷətaːʁ]}}
|-
| boy (erg.) || wall (abs.) || (s)he destroyed
|-
|colspan=3|"The boy destroyed the wall."
|}

*In this example the rock changes by moving (motion in air), the man causes the change and the wall acts as the indirect object of the preposition.

:{|
|-
|Лӏым|| мывэр || дэпкъым || тедзэ
|-
|{{IPA|[ɬʼər}} || {{IPA|məvar}} || {{IPA|dapqəm}} || {{IPA|tajd͡za]}}
|-
| man (erg.) || rock (abs.) || wall (obl.) || (s)he is throwing at
|-
|colspan=4|"The man is throwing the rock at the wall."
|}

==Noun==
===Singular and plural===
A Circassian noun can be in one of the following two states: singular plural

Singular nouns have zero morpheme, while plural nouns use the additional хэ morpheme, which is attached to the main form of the word. For example: singular: унэ "home", тхылъ "book", plural: унэ-хэ-р "homes", тхылъ-хэ-р "books".

Unlike English verbs, Circassian verbs use -х- or -я- morphemes to form their plural versions. The second morpheme is attached to the verb in front of the verb's root, and the first is attached after it. For example: ар макӏуэ "he is going", ахэр макӏуэ-х "they are going"; ар абы еджащ "he read it", ар ахэмэ я-джащ "he read them".

===Definite and indefinite forms===
Circassian nouns usually have either definite or indefinite form. The idea behind this conception is close to the idea of definite/indefinite articles in English. Definite form of Circassian nouns has -р or -м formats at the end of the word. For example: щӏалэ "boy" – indefinite noun (has none of the definite formats) - it can be used in generalizations or when the boy is unknown to either the "speaker" or "listener" (a/an or zero article in English); щӏалэр, щӏалэм "the boy" – it is used when the mentioned boy is well known to both the "speaker" and "listener".

===Noun cases===
Kabardian also declines nouns into four different cases, each with corresponding suffixes: [[Absolutive case|absolutive]], [[Ergative case|ergative]], [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], and [[Invertive case|invertive]].

|-
|[[Ergative case|Ergative]]-[[Oblique case|Oblique]]
| м
| {{IPA|/m/}}

|-
|[[Adverbial case|Adverbial]]
| ыу
| {{IPA|/əw/}}
|щӏалу {{IPA|[ɕʼaɮəw]}} ('boy')
|}

====Absolutive case====
Has the suffix - р {{IPA|/r/}} (e.g. щӏалэр {{IPA|[ɕʼaːɮar]}} 'the boy', щӏалэхэр {{IPA|[ɕʼaːɮaxar]}} ('the boys'), шыр {{IPA|[ʃər]}} 'the horse'). It acts as the subject of intransitive verbs and the direct object of transitive verbs.

*Marking the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of [[intransitive verbs]]
:{|
|-
|'''щIалэр'''|| йоджэ
|-
|'''щӏалэ-р'''||йо-джэ
|-
|{{IPA|['''ɕʼaːɮar'''}} || {{IPA|jawd͡ʒa]}}
|-
|'''the boy (abs.)''' || (s)he is reading
|-
|colspan=3|"'''the boy''' is reading"
|}
*Marking the direct [[Object (grammar)|object]] of [[transitive verbs]]
:{|
|-
|сэ || '''тхылъыр''' || къэсщтащ
|-
|сэ || '''тхылъы-р''' || къэ-с-щта-щ
|-
|{{IPA|[sa}} || {{IPA|'''txəɬər'''}}|| {{IPA|qasɕtaːɕ]}}
|-
|I || '''the book (abs.)''' || I picked it up
|-
|colspan=3|"I picked the '''book''' up"
|}

====Ergative case====
Has the suffix -м {{IPA|/-m/}} (e.g. щӏалэм {{IPA|[ɕʼaːɮam]}} 'the boy's', щӏалэхэмэ {{IPA|[ɕʼaːɮaxama]}} 'the boys&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;', шым {{IPA|[ʃəm]}} 'the horse's). This case has two roles: Ergative role and Oblique role.

*Ergative role - Marking the subject of transitive verbs
:{|
|-
|'''бзылъхугъэм''' || джанэр || егъэкъабзэ
|-
|'''бзылъхугъэ-м''' || джанэ-р || егъэкъабзэ
|-
|{{IPA|['''bzəɬxʷəʁam'''}} ||{{IPA|d͡ʒaːnar}} ||{{IPA|jaʁaqaːbza]}}
|-
|'''the woman (erg.)''' || the shirt (abs.) || (s)he cleans
|-
|colspan=3|"'''the woman''' cleans the shirt"
|}

*Oblique role - Marking the indirect object of intransitive verbs
:{|
|-
|щӏалэр || '''тхылъым''' || йоджэ
|-
|щӏалэ-р || '''тхылъ-ым''' || йоджэ
|-
|{{IPA|[ɕʼaːɮar}} ||{{IPA|'''txəɬəm'''}} ||{{IPA|jawd͡ʒa]}}
|-
|the boy (abs.)|| '''the book (erg.)''' || (s)he reads
|-
|colspan=3|"the boy reads '''the book'''"
|}

The Ergative-Oblique case can also be used as an adverbial modifier, for example: жэщ night → жэщым in the night.

====Instrumental-Directional Case====
Indefinite nouns are marked by the affix -кӏэ : тхылъ-кӏэ, "by/with book", ӏэ-к1э "by/with hand". definite nouns express this case using the ergative affix -м in conjunction with the affix -кӏэ: уадэ-м-кӏэ "by/with the hammer", тхылъ-м-к1э "by/with the book".

:{|
|-

|-
|boy (arg.) || '''using Circassian language (ins.)''' || (s)he is speaking
|-
|colspan=3|"The boy is speaking '''(using) Circassian language'''."
|}

The Instrumental case can also mark the direction of action:
** гъуэгу /ʁʷaɡʷ/ road → гъуэгумкӏэ /ʁʷaɡʷəmt͡ʃʼa/ from the road (direction).
** унэ /wəna/ house → унэмкӏэ /wənamt͡ʃʼa/ from the house.
** хы /xə/ sea → хымкӏэ /xəmt͡ʃʼa/ from the sea (direction).

|-
|colspan=3|"Tom, come to our '''school''' today"
|}

====Adverbial case====
Has the suffix -уэ {{IPA|/wa/}}, or -у {{IPA|/əw/}} (e.g. щӏалу  {{IPA|[ɕʼaːɮəw]}} 'boy').  This case indicates the manner in which the verb was done.

:{|
|-
|лӏыр || '''профессорэу''' || мэлажэ
|-
|лӏыр || '''профессор-эу''' || мэлажэ
|-
| {{IPA|[ɬʼər}} || {{IPA|'''profesoraw'''}} ||{{IPA|maɮaːʒa]}}
|-
| man (abs.) || '''professor (adv.)''' || (s)he works
|-
|colspan=3|"The man works '''as a professor'''."
|}

===Pro-drop===
Kabardian is a [[pro-drop language]]. The subject and the object pronouns are sometimes omitted when verb conjugations reflect [[Grammatical number|number]] and [[Grammatical person|person]].

* Both subject and object are mentioned :
:{|
|-
|щӏалэм|| пщащэр ||елъэгъу
|-
|щӏалэ-м|| пщащэ-р ||елъэгъу
|-
|{{IPA|[ɕʼaːɮam}} || {{IPA|pɕaːɕar}} || {{IPA|jaɬaʁʷə]}}
|-
|the boy (erg.) || the girl (abs.) || (s)he is seeing
|-
|colspan=3|"the boy is seeing the girl"
|}

* If the direct object is not mentioned :
:{|
|-
|'''щӏалэм'''|| елъэгъу
|-
|'''щӏалэ-м'''|| елъэгъу
|-
|{{IPA|['''ɕʼaːɮam'''}} || {{IPA|jaɬaʁʷə]}}
|-
|'''the boy (erg.)''' || (s)he is seeing
|-
|colspan=3|"'''the boy''' is seeing him/her/it'''"
|}

* If the subject is not mentioned :
:{|
|-
|'''пщащэр'''|| елъэгъу
|-
|'''пщащэ-р'''|| елъэгъу
|-
|{{IPA|['''pɕaːɕar'''}} || {{IPA|jaɬaʁʷə]}}
|-
|'''the girl (abs.)''' || (s)he is seeing
|-
|colspan=3|"(s)he is seeing '''the girl'''"
|}

* If both subject and object are not mentioned :
:{|
|-
|'''елъэгъу'''
|-
|'''елъэгъу'''
|-
|{{IPA|[jaɬaʁʷə]}}
|-
|(s)he is seeing
|-
|colspan=3|"'''(s)he is seeing him/her/it'''"
|}

===Noun and adjective===
In Kabardian, if a noun is accompanied by an adjective, the adjective is always placed right after the noun and also gets the grammatical role suffixes instead of the noun.

*Absolutive case 
:{|
|-
|пщэщэ || '''дахэр''' || макӏуэ
|-
|{{IPA|[pɕaɕa}}|| {{IPA|'''daːxar'''}}|| {{IPA|maːkʷʼa]}}
|-
| girl || '''the pretty (abs.)'''  || (s)he is going
|-
|colspan=3|"'''the pretty''' girl is going"
|}

*Ergative case
:{|
|-
|щӏалэ || '''кӏыхьэм''' || ешхы || мыӏэрысэ
|-
|{{IPA|[ɕʼaːɮa}} || {{IPA|'''t͡ʃʼəħam'''}} || {{IPA|jaʃxə}} || {{IPA|məʔarəsa]}}
|-
| boy || '''the long (erg.)''' || he is eating a/the || the apple (abs.)
|-
|colspan=3|"'''the long''' boy is eating the apple"
|}

*Instrumental case 
:{|
|-
|къэрэндащ || '''папцӏэмкӏэ''' || сотхэ
|-
|{{IPA|[qarandaːɕ}} || {{IPA|'''papt͡sʼamt͡ʃʼa'''}} || {{IPA|sawtxa]}}
|-
| pencil || sharp (ins.) || I am writing
|-
|colspan=3|"''I am writing '''with (using) the sharp '''pencil''"
|}

===[[Participle]]===
In Kabardian someone (person) or something (animal, plant, object) that does a specific verb (or something happened to him/it) can be represented with the verb word with the additional suffix -э (a) (for present tense -рэ (-ra)). For example:
*макӏуэ /maːkʷ'a/ - he is going → макӏуэрэ /maːkʷ'ara/ - the person that's going
*машхэх /maːʃxax/ - they are eating → машхэхэрэ /maːʃxaxara/ - the people that are eating.
*мэлэжьащ /malaʑaːɕ/ - he worked → мэлэжьащэ /malaʑaːɕa/ - the person that worked.

:{|
|-
| '''макӏуэрэр''' || сикъуэш
|-
| '''макӏуэ-рэр''' || си-къуэш
|-
|{{IPA|[maːkʷʼarar}} || {{IPA|səjʃ]}}
|-
| the person that is going (abs.) || my brother
|-
|colspan=3|"'''the person that is going''' is my brother"
|}

===Creating nouns from adjective===
In Kabardian someone (person) or something (animal, plant, object) that have a specific adjective can be presented with the adjective word with the additional noun case suffix (absolutive, ergative, etc.) For example:
*дахэ /daːxa/ - pretty → дахэр /daːxar/ - the pretty person (absolutive case).
*ӏэфӏ /ʔafʼə/ - tasty → ӏэфӏэр /ʔafʼar / - the tasty ones (absolutive case).
*щӏыӏэ /ɕʼəʔa/ - cold → щӏыӏэм /ɕʼəʔam/ - in the cold (ergative case).

:{|
|-
| щӏалэр || '''хуабэм'''  || хэт
|-
| щӏалэ-р || '''хуабэ-м'''  || хэт
|-
|{{IPA|[ɕʼaːɮar}} || {{IPA|'''xʷaːbam'''}} ||{{IPA|xat]}}
|-
| the boy (abs.) || '''the heat (erg.)''' || (s)he is standing in
|-
|colspan=3|"The boy is standing '''in the heat'''"
|}

==[[Demonstratives]]==
Kabardian has three demonstratives: а /ʔaː/, мо /mo/ and мы /mə/.

а /ʔaː/
# [[wikt:that|that]]
#: {{lang|ady|'''а''' ӏанэ}} — '''that''' table
#: {{lang|ady|'''а''' пщащэ}} — '''that''' girl
#: {{lang|ady|'''а''' щӏалэм жыӏэ}} — '''that''' boy is saying
* The determiner {{lang|ady|'а'}} /ʔaː/ refer to a referent that is far away and invisible to both the speaker and the listener(s). It is similar to the English language determiner [[wikt:this|that]], but with the condition that the referent has to be invisible or far away.

мо /maw/
# [[wikt:that|that]]
#: {{lang|ady|'''мо''' ӏанэ}} — '''that''' table
#: {{lang|ady|'''мо''' пщащэ}} — '''that''' girl
#: {{lang|ady|'''мо''' щӏалэм жыӏэ}} — '''that''' boy is saying
* The determiner {{lang|ady|'мо'}} refer to a referent that is visible and in a known distance from both the speaker and the listener(s) (both the speaker and the listener(s) can see the referent). It is similar to the English language determiner [[wikt:this|that]], but with the condition that the referent has to be visible.

мы /mə/
# [[wikt:this|this]]
#: {{lang|ady|'''мы''' ӏанэ}} — '''this''' table
#: {{lang|ady|'''мы''' пщащэ}} — '''this''' girl
#: {{lang|ady|'''мы''' щӏалэм жыӏэ}} — '''this''' boy is saying
* The determiner {{lang|ady|'мы'}} refer to a referent that is close to both the speaker and the listener(s). It is exactly like the English language determiner [[wikt:this|this]].

===[[Grammatical conjugation|Conjugation]]===
The demonstratives can be used to express different things like:

:Location: адэ "there", модэ "there", мыдэ "here".
:Similarity: апхуэд "like that", мопхуэд "like", мыпхуэд "like this".

==Pronouns==

===Personal pronouns===
In Kabardian, personal pronouns are only expressed in first person, second person in singular and plural forms.

===Demonstrative Pronouns===
Demonstrative pronouns are мы "this", мо "that", а "that". There is a contradistinction between 'мы' and 'мо' on how far the referred object is. The pronoun 'а' is neutral on this matter. Third person pronouns are expressed as demonstrative pronouns.

==Verbs==
{{Main article|Kabardian verbs}}
In Kabardian, like all [[Northwest Caucasian languages]], the verb is the most inflected part of speech. Verbs are typically [[head final]] and are conjugated for tense, person, number, etc. Some of Circassian verbs can be morphologically simple, some of them consist only of one morpheme, like: кӏуэ "go", щтэ "take". However, generally, Circassian verbs are characterized as structurally and semantically difficult entities. Morphological structure of a Circassian verb includes affixes (prefixes, suffixes) which are specific to the language. Verbs' affixes express meaning of subject, direct or indirect object, adverbial, singular or plural form, negative form, mood, direction, mutuality, compatibility and reflexivity, which, as a result, creates a complex verb, that consists of many morphemes and semantically expresses a sentence. For example: уакъыдэсэгъэпсэлъэжы "I am forcing you to talk to them again" consists of the following morphemes: у-а-къы-дэ-со-гъэ-псэлъэ-жы, with the following meanings: "you (у) with them (а)  from there (къы) together (дэ) I (со) am forcing (гъэ) to speak (псэлъэн) again (жы)".

===Transitivity===
Verbs in Kabardian can be [[transitive verbs|transitive]] or [[intransitive verbs|intransitive]].

In a sentence with a transitive verb, nouns in the absolutive case (marked as -р) play the role of direct object. In the sentences of this type the noun in the subject's position is in the ergative case (marked as -м):

:Щӏалэм письмэр йотхы "The boy is writing the letter";
:Пхъащӏэм уадэр къыщтащ "The carpenter took out the hammer";
:Хьэм тхьак1умкӏыхьэр къыубытащ "The dog has caught the hares".

In these sentences the verbs етхы "is writing", къыщтащ "took out", къыубытащ "has caught" are transitive verbs, and the nouns письмэр "letter", уадэр "hammer", тхьак1умк1ыхьэр "hare" are in the absolutive case (suffix -р) and express direct object in the sentences, while the nouns щӏалэм "boy", пхъащӏэм "carpenter", хьэм "dog" are subjects expressed in the ergative case.

In a sentence with an intransitive verb, there is no direct object, and the real subject is usually expressed by a noun in the absolutive case.

:Жэмахъуэр щыт "The shepherd is standing (there)";
:Пэсакӏуэр макӏуэ "The security guard is going";
:Лӏыр мэжей "The man is sleeping".

In these sentences with intransitive verbs, nouns that play role of subject are expressed in the absolutive case: жэмахъуэ-р "shepherd", пэсакӏуэ-р "guard", лӏы-р "man".

There are verbs in the Kabardian language that in different contexts and situations can be used both as transitive and intransitive. For example:

:Абджыр мэкъутэ "The glass is being broken",
:Щӏалэм абджыр йокъутэ "The boy is breaking the glass".

In the first sentence the verb мэкъутэ "is being broken" is used as an intransitive verb that creates an absolutive construction. In the second sentence the verb йо-къутэ "is breaking" creates an ergative construction. Both of the verbs are formed from the verb къутэ-н "to break".

In the Kabardian language, intransitive verbs can have indirect objects in a sentence. The indirect objects are expressed by a noun in the oblique case (which is also marked as -м). For example:

:Щӏалэр пщащэм йоплъ "The boy looking at the girl",
:Лӏыр жыгым щӏэлъ "The man lays under the tree".
:Щӏалэр тхылъым йоджэ "The boy reads the book".

In these sentences with intransitive verbs, nouns that play role of indirect object are expressed in the oblique case: пщащэ-м  "girl", жыгы-м "tree", тхылъы-м "book".

Intransitive verbs can be turned into transitive with the causative affix -гъэ- (meaning "to force, to make"). For example:

:Ар мажэ "He is running", but Абы ар е-гъа-жэ "He forces him to run",
:Ар матхэ "He is writing", but Абы ар е-гъа-тхэ "He makes him to write".

The verbs in the first sentences мажэ "is running", матхэ "is writing"  are intransitive, and the verbs in the second sentences  егъажэ "forces ... to run", егъатхэ "makes ... to write" are already transitive.

===Dynamic and static verbs===
Kabardian verbs can be either dynamic or static.

Dynamic verbs express (process of) actions that are taking place (natural role of verbs in English):

:Сэ сэжэ "I am running";
:Сэ сэкӏуэ "I am going",
:Сэ сэлъэгъу "I am seeing",
:Сэ жысэӏэ "I am saying".

Static verbs express states or results of actions:

:Сэ сыщыт "I am standing",
:Сэ сыщылъ "I am lying.",
:Сэ сыпхъащӏ "I am a carpenter",
:Сэ сытракторист "I am a tractor-driver".

===Person===
Kabardian verbs have different forms to express different person. These forms are, mostly, created with specific prefixes. Here how it looks like in singular:

:сэ-тхэ "I write",
:уэ-тхэ "You write",
:ма-тхэ "writes";

and in plural:

:дэ-тхэ "We write",
:фэ-тхэ "You write",
:ма-тхэ-х "They write".

===Valency increasing===

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! Case
! Prefix
! Meaning
! Example
|-
|Causative || гъэ~ [ʁa~] || "to force, to make" || гъэ-плъэн [ʁapɬan] &lt;br&gt; "to make him look at"
|-
|Comitative || дэ~ [da~] || "with" || д-еплъын [dajpɬən] &lt;br&gt; "to look with"
|-
|Benefactive || хуэ~ [xʷ~] || "for" || ху-еплъын [xʷajpɬən] &lt;br&gt; "to look for"
|-
|Malefactive || фӏ~ [fʼa~] || "against one's interest" || фӏ-еплъын [ʃʷʼajpɬən] &lt;br&gt; "to look against his interest"
|-
|Reflexive || зэ~ [za~] || "self" || зэ-плъын [zapɬən] &lt;br&gt; "to look at oneself"
|}

===Moods===
Imperative mood of second person in singular has no additional affixes: щтэ "take", кӏуэ "go", тхы "write"; in plural the affix -фы is added in front of the verbs: фы-къак1у "you (plural) go", фы-тхы "you (plural) write", фы-щтэ "you (plural) take".

Conditional mood is expressed with suffix -мэ: сы-к1уэ-мэ "if I go", сы-жэ-мэ "if I run", с-щ1э-мэ "if I do".

Concessive mood is expressed with suffix -ми: сы-к1уэ-ми "even if I go", сы-жэ-ми "even if I run", с-щ1э-ми "even if I do".

Affirmative form is expressed with the affix -къэ: ма-кӏуэ-къэ "isn't he is going?", мэ-гыщӏэ-къэ "isn't he washing?".

===Participle===
Present participles in the Circassian language are formed from the appropriate dynamic verbs with the suffix -рэ:

:кӏуэ-рэ-р "one that's walking",
:жэ-рэ-р "one that's running".

Participles can also be created from static verbs. In this case no additional morphological modifications are required. For example: щысыр "sitting", щылъыр "lying". In the past and future tenses participles have no special morphological attributes, in other words, their form is identical to the main form of the verb. The forms of participles in different grammatical cases are equal to the forms of the appropriate verbs. The same is also true for their time-tenses.

===Masdar===

Masdar (a form of verb close to gerund) in the Kabardian language is expressed with the suffix -н:

:тхы-н "a write (writing)",
:жэ-н "a run (running)",
:щтэ-н "a take (taking)",
:псэлъэ-н "a talk (talking)",
:дзы-н "a throw (throwing)".

Masdar has grammatical cases:

:Absolutive жэны-р,
:Ergative жэны-м,
:Instrumental жэны-м-кӏэ,
:Adverbial жэн-у

and different forms for different person:

:сы-жэн "I will run",
:у-жэн "you will run",
:жэн "he will run".

===Negative form===
In the Adyghe language negative form of a word is expressed with different morphemes (prefixes, suffixes). In participles, adverbial participles, masdars, imperative, interrogative and other forms of verbs their negative from is expressed with the prefix -мы, which, usually, goes before the root morpheme, that describes the main meaning:

:у-мы-тх "you don't write",
:у-мы-кӏу "you don't go",
:сы-къы-пхуэ-мы-щэмэ "if you can't bring me",
:у-къа-мы-гъа-к1уэмэ "if you aren't forced to come".

In verbs the negative meaning can also be expressed with the suffix -къым, which usually goes after the suffixes of time-tenses. For example:

:сы-тэджыр-къым "I am not getting up",
:сы-тэ-джа-къым "I have not got up",
:сы-тэджыну-къым "I will not get up".

===Positional conjugation===
In Kabardian, the positional prefixes are expressing being in different positions and places and can also express the direction of the verb. Here is the positional conjugation of some dynamic verbs, showing how the prefix changes the indicated direction of the verb:

==[[Adjectives]]==
From the morphological point of view adjectives in the Circassian language are not very different from nouns. In combinations with nouns they lose their grammatical independence. Adjectives form their plural form the same way nouns do, they also use the same affixes to form different grammatical cases (from Absolutive to Adverbial).

Adjectives can be either qualitative or relative.

Adjectives can be in singular or plural form: хужы "white" (singular) - хужы-хэ-р "whites" (plural).

They switch grammatical cases similarly to nouns:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Case
! Singular
! Plural
|-
|[[Absolutive case|Absolutive]]
| хужыр
| хужыхэр
|-
|[[Ergative case|Ergative]]-[[Oblique case|Oblique]]
| хужым
| хужыхэм
|-
|[[Instrumental case|Instrumental]]
| хужы(м)кӏэ
| хужыхэ(м)кӏэ
|-
|[[Adverbial case|Adverbial]]
| хужу
| хужыху
|}

A qualitative adjective as a compliment in a sentence goes after the word it describes: к1алэ дэгъу "good boy", унэ лъагэ "high house"; a relative adjective goes before it: пхъэ уадэ "wooden hammer", гъучӏ пӏэкӏор "iron bed". In the second case adjectives do not change their form, only the appropriate nous do. For example: in plural - пхъэ унэ "wooden house".

In different grammatical cases:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Case
! Singular
! Plural
|-
|[[Absolutive case|Absolutive]]
| пхъэ унэр
| пхъэ унэхэр
|-
|[[Ergative case|Ergative]]-[[Oblique case|Oblique]]
| пхъэ унэм
| пхъэ унэхэм
|-
|[[Instrumental case|Instrumental]]
| пхъэ унэ(м)кӏэ
| пхъэ унэхэ(м)кӏэ
|-
|[[Adverbial case|Adverbial]]
| пхъэ уну
| пхъэ унэху
|}

Combining adjectives with nouns it is possible to produce a great lot of phrases: пщэщэ дахэ "beautiful girl", щӏалэ дэгъу "good boy", цӏыху кӏыхьэ "long man", гъуэгу занщӏэ "straight road", удз шхъуантӏэ "green grass" and so on. These phrases can be easily included into sentences. If a noun has a certain grammatical case, the adjective gets the suffix of the case instead of the noun, for example щӏэлэ лъэщы-р "the strong boy (abs.) and уадэ псынщӏэ-мкӏэ "using the light hammer (ins.).

|-
|colspan=4|"We were walking on the '''straight''' road."
|}

Circassian qualitative adjectives also have comparative and superlative forms. For example: нэхъ хужы "whiter, more white" (comparative form) and янэхъ хужы "whitest, most white",

The Comparative degree is formed by auxiliary word нэхъ:

Ар абы нэхъ лъагэ – he is higher than you,&lt;br /&gt; 
Нэхъ ины хъущ – He became bigger [More big became],&lt;br /&gt;
Нэхъ лӏыгъэ къызхэбгъэлъын хуей - You must be braver.

The superlative degrees is formed by auxiliary word анахь (more than all...):

Ар пщащэмэ янэхъ дахэ – She is the most beautiful among the girls,&lt;br /&gt; 
Ар псоми янэхъ лъагэ - It is the highest,&lt;br /&gt; 
Псэри шхын янэхъ дэгъумкӏэ игъэшхащ – (S)he feeds him with the tastiest meal,&lt;br /&gt; 
Ар псоми янэхъ лъэщ – He is the strongest.

====Opinion====
To indicate a thought or an opinion of someone, the prefix фӏэ~ (fʼa~) is added to the adjective. This can also be used on nouns but it is very uncommon. For example:
* дахэ "pretty" → фӏэдах "it's pretty for him.
* дэхагъ "as pretty" → фӏэдэхащ "it was pretty for him.
* ӏэфӏ "tasty" → фӏэӏэфӏ "it is tasty for him.
* плъыжьы "red" → фӏэплъыжь "it is red for him.

====Measurement====
To indicate a measure of a certain adjective the suffix ~гъэ (~ʁa) is added. Usually it is used for measurable adjectives like length, height, weight, size, strength and speed but it can be used on any adjective. This suffix turns the adjective to a noun.

*кӏыхьэ /t͡ʃʼaħə/ - long → кӏыхьэгъэ /t͡ʃʼaħəʁa/ - length.
*ӏэтыгъэ /ʔatəʁa/ - high → ӏэтыгъагъэ /ʔatəʁaːʁa/ - height.
*псынщӏэ /psənɕʼa/ - fast → псынщӏагъэ /psənɕʼaːʁa/ - speed.
*хуабэ /xʷaːba/ - hot → хуабагъэ /xʷabaːʁa/ - heat.
*ӏувы /ʔʷəvə/ - wide → ӏувыгъэ /ʔʷəvəʁa/ - width.
*дахэ /daːxa/ - beautiful → дэхагъэ /daxaːʁa/ - beauty.

====State of the adjective====
The suffix ~гъакӏэ (~ʁaːt͡ʃʼa) is appended to adjectives to form nouns meaning "the state of being the adjective".

*кӏыхьэ /t͡ʃʼaħə/ - long → кӏыхьэгъакӏэ /t͡ʃʼaħəʁaːt͡ʃʼa/ - lengthiness; longness.
*псынщӏэ /psənɕʼa/ - fast → псынщӏэгъакӏэ /psənɕʼaʁaːt͡ʃʼa/ - speediness.
*лъэщ /ɬaɕ/ - strong → лъэщыгъакӏэ /ɬaɕəʁaːt͡ʃʼa/ - strongness.

==Unions==
In English the word "and" is used to connect parts of speech with others, while in Circassian, there are different ways to connect different parts of speech with others.

The conjunctions ыкӏи /ət͡ʃəj/ "and" can also be used to connect different parts of speech.

:Verbs: Щӏалэр йоджэ ыкӏи матхэ "The boy reads and writes".
:Adjectives: Щӏалэр дахэ ыкӏи кӏыхьэ "The boy is handsome and tall".

==Conjunctions==
Conjunctions in the Circassian language play the same role like in English, they are used to connect together, in different ways, words or parts of a difficult sentence. According to structure of Circassian conjunctions they can be separated into two groups: simple and complex.

===Simple conjunctions===
Among simple Circassian conjunctions are:

* ыкӏи - "and".
* е - "or".
* ауэ - "but".

:{|
|-
| Сэ || сыкӏуащ || къалэм, || '''ауэ''' || къэзгъэзэжакъым

|-
| I || I went || city (erg.) ||'''but''' || I didn't return
|-
|colspan=5|"I went to the city, '''but''' I haven't returned."
|}

===Complex conjunctions===
* арщхьэк1э - "because".
* aт1э - "in spite of".
* хьэмэ - "or".
* сыту - "as".
* щхьэк1э - "though".
* сыт щхьэк1э - "because (of) / why".
* папщ1э - "for".
* папщ1эк1э - "as".
* щыгъуэ - "when".
* зэ-зэ - "first…then".
* е-е - "either-or".
* къудейуэ - "as soon as".
* ару - "just".
* пэтми - "although".
* щытмэ - "if".
* ипкъ итк1э - "therefore".
* къыхэк1к1э - "because / that’s why".

==Particles==
In the Circassian language participles are different both by their semantics and structure. Semantically they fall into the following groups: affirmative, negative, interrogative, intensive, indicatory and stimulating.

* дыдэ - "quite, very".
* уеблэмэ - "even".
* пIэрэ - "whether, really".
* мис - "here".
* мес - "there (near by)".
* кхъы1э - "please".
* нэхъ - "more".
* нэхърэ - "more than".
* хьэуэ - "no".
* нтIэ - "yes".
* акъудей (аркъудей) - "quite not".
* къудей - "just now".

==[[Postpositions]]==
In the Circassian language, as well as in other Ibero-Caucasian languages, role of prepositions belongs to postpositions. It is difficult to define the exact count of postpositions in the Circassian language, because even such major parts of speech as nouns (from the point of view of their functionality) sometimes can be included into the group, together with some verb prefixes. For example, in the sentence Тхылъыр столым телъ "The book is lying on the table" the noun has no preposition, but the meaning remains clear because in the verb те-лъ "is lying" the prefix те- expresses something's being on a surface, so this form of the verb literally means "on the surface is lying".

Nouns and adverbs sometimes play role of postpositions. For example, nous that describe different parts of human body (head, nose, side and so on) sometimes function as postpositions. For example: Фызыр лӏым ипэ иту кӏуащ "The wife went in front of the husband" (the preposition "in front of" in the Circassian sentence is expressed by the phrase ипэ иту "being in front of his nose").

Nouns and pronouns combine with a postposition in the ergative grammatical case only. For example, the postposition деж "near, beside" requires a word in the ergative case:

* жыгы-м деж "near the tree".

Postpositions can attach possessive prefixes to themselves. For example, in singular:

* сэ с-а-деж "near me",
* о у-а-деж "near you",
* абы и деж "near him";

in plural:

* дэ д-а-деж "near us",
* фэ ф-а-деж "near you",
* ахэмэ я деж "near them".

The following words are used as postpositions in the Circassian language:

* ипIэкIэ "before".
* пщ1ондэ "before".
* щыгъуэ "during".
* икIуэцIкI "inside".
* лъандэ "since".
* къэскIэ "until".
* нэс "until".
* деж "near".
* дежкIэ "at".
* иужь "after".
* пащхьэ "in front of".
* щ1ыбагъ "behind".
* щIагъ "under".
* нэмыщI "except".
* фIэкIа "except".
* къэс "every".

==Numbers==
*Numbers from zero to ten are specific words
:'''1''' зы {{Audio-IPA|Ady-1.oga|[zə]}}
:'''2'''  тӀу {{Audio-IPA|Ady-2.oga|[tʷʼə]}}

*One hundred is щэ (ɕa). The hundreds are formed by the hundred word root (щ (ɕ)) followed by -и-

(-i-) and the multiplier digit root.
:'''100''' щэ (ɕa)
:'''101''' щэрэ зырэ (ɕara zəra) (100 and 1)

:'''800''' щий (ɕij) (100 × 8)
:'''900''' щибгъу (ɕibʁʷ) (100 × 9)
*One thousand is мин (min). The thousands are formed by the thousand word root (мин (məjn))

followed by -и- (-i-) and the multiplier digit root.
:'''1000''' мин (min)
:'''1001''' минрэ зырэ (minra zəra) (1000 and 1)
:'''1010''' минрэ пщӏырэ (minra pʃʼəra) (1000 and 10)
:'''1100''' минрэ щэрэ (minra ɕara) (1000 and 100)

:'''3000''' минищ (miniɕ) (1000 × 3)
:'''4000''' миниплӀ (minipɬʼ) (1000 × 4)
:'''5000''' минитху (minitxʷ) (1000 × 5)
:'''6000''' миних (minix) (1000 × 6)
:'''7000''' минибл (minibɮ) (1000 × 7)

:'''20000''' минитӀощӏ (minitʷʼaɕʼə) (1000 × 20)
:'''100000''' минищэ (miniɕa) (1000 × 100)
:'''200000''' минищитӀу  (miniɕitʷʼ) (1000 × 200)

When composed, the hundred word takes the -рэ (-ra) suffix, as well as the ten and the unit if any (e.g.: щэрэ зырэ (ɕara zəra) [101], щэрэ тIурэ (ɕara tʷʼəra) [102], щэрэ пщӀыкӀузырэ (pʃʼəkʷʼətʷʼəra) [111], щитӀурэ щэщӀырэ плIырэ (ɕitʷʼəra ɕat͡ʃəra pɬʼəra) [234]).

===Ordinal numbers===
*Except апэрэ/япэрэ - first (aːpara/jaːpara) are formed by prefix я- (jaː-) and suffix – нэрэ (- nara). For

example: ятIунэрэ - second (jaːtʷʼənara), ящынэрэ - third (jaːɕənara), яплIынэрэ - fourth (jaːpɬʼənara).

'''Khiamniungan''' (Khiamngan, Khiamniungan) is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]] spoken by the [[Khiamniungan people]] in east-central [[Noklak District]] of [[Nagaland]] in northeastern India and in northwestern Burma. The majority of the Khiamniungans in India are known to Pathso-sui which remains the main language within their geographical area.

==Names==
Alternate names for Khiamniungan include Aoshedd, Khiamnga, Kalyokengnyu, Khiamngan, Khiamniungan, Nokaw, Tukhemmi, and Welam (''Ethnologue'').

==Distribution and status==
There are approximately 50,000 speakers of Khiamniungan. There are an estimated 29 Khiamniungan villages in India and 132 in Burma.&lt;ref&gt;Pillai, S.K. (2001). The Water People: a Khiamniungan landscape. India International Centre Quarterly, Vol. 27/28, Vol. 27, no. 4/Vol. 28, no. 1: The Human Landscape, 95–108. Retrieved from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt; "Khiamniungan" is the [[Exonym and endonym|autonym]] for the language, which means "the source of water" or "water people", whereas ''Kalyokengnyu'' is an [[exonym]] meaning "dwelling in stone", given to the group by European anthropologists after the slate roof houses the people lived in.&lt;ref&gt;Matisoff, J. (1996). Languages and dialects of Tibeto-Burman (2nd ed., p. 76). Berkeley: STEDT.&lt;/ref&gt; The low number of speakers of Khiamniugan makes it vulnerable, but it is taught in schools and supported by the government through cultural programs.&lt;ref name=e18&gt;{{Ethnologue18|kix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==
Like most languages spoken in Nagaland, Khiamniungan is written in a [[ISO basic Latin alphabet|Latin alphabet]], due to the early Christian missionary presence in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Minahan, J. (2012). Nagas. In Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of scholarship==
Most of the information of Khiamniungan comes from its inclusion in studies of the Naga or [[Konyak languages]] by the [[Central Institute for Indian Languages]] in Mysore. There is also a Khiamniungan vocabulary published in 1974 by Nagaland Bhasha-Parishad.&lt;ref&gt;Kumāra, B. Bihārī. (1975). Hindi khiyamanna Angreji sabda-suci = Hindi Khiamngan English Vocabulary. Kohima: Nagaland Bhasha Parishad&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Levitation''' or '''transvection''' in the [[paranormal]] context is the rising of a human body and other objects into the air by mystical means or meditation. Some [[parapsychology]] and [[religious]] believers interpret alleged instances of levitation as the result of [[supernatural]] action of [[psychic]] power or [[Energy (esotericism)|spiritual energy]]. The [[scientific community]] states there is no evidence that levitation exists and alleged levitation events are explainable by natural causes (such as [[Magic (illusion)|magic trickery]], [[illusion]], and [[hallucination]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stein|first1=Gordon|authorlink=Gordon Stein|title=The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal|date=1996|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=9781573920216|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert Todd|authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|date=2003|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=9780471272427|page=198|quote=Levitation is the act of ascending into the air and floating in apparent defiance of gravity.

==Religious views==
[[File:Colin Evans fraud in 1938.jpg|thumb|right|[[Colin Evans (medium)|Colin Evans]], who claimed spirits levitated him into the air, was exposed as a fraud.]]
Various religions have claimed examples of levitation amongst their followers. This is generally used either as a demonstration of the validity or power of the religion,&lt;ref name="Schulberg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schulberg|first1=Lucille|title=Historic India|date=1968|publisher=[[Time-Life Books]]|location=New York|isbn=9780682244008|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as evidence of the holiness or adherence to the religion of the particular levitator.

===Buddhism===

===Hinduism===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
*In [[Hinduism]], it is believed that some Hindu mystics and [[gurus]] who have who have achieved certain spiritual powers (called [[siddhis]]) are able to levitate. In [[Sanskrit]], the power of levitation is called ''laghiman'' ('lightness') or ''dardura-siddhi'' (the 'frog power').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowker|first1=John|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=019861053X|pages=259, 567, 576}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yogananda]]'s book ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'' has accounts of [[Hindu]] Yogis who levitated in the course of their meditation.

*[[Yogi pullavar|Yogi Subbayah Pullavar]] was reported to have levitated into the air for four minutes in front of a crowd of 150 witnesses on June 6, 1936. He was seen suspended horizontally several feet above the ground, in a trance, lightly resting his hand on top of a cloth-covered stick. Pullavar's arms and legs could not be bent from their locked position once on the ground.
*[[Shirdi Sai Baba]], an Indian [[yogi]], is described in the Sri Sai Satcharitra to have mastered the art of levitation while sleeping.
*The [[Transcendental Meditation movement]] claims that practitioners of the [[TM-Sidhi program]] of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] achieve what they call "[[Yogic Flying]]". They say that there are three stages of Yogic Flying – hopping, floating, and flying – and that they have so far achieved just the first stage. Transcendental meditation groups have held annual "Yogic Flying Contests" to see who could hop the farthest or the fastest. Proponents say the hopping occurs spontaneously with no effort while skeptics say there is no levitation and they are using their thighs to bounce in the [[lotus position]].

===Judaism===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
Levitation has been described in Jewish text many times by use of either magic or non-magical means. Levitation by magic was depicted in Jewish texts to be practiced by [[Balaam]] who lived at the time of [[Moses]]. Magic involves directly ordering the spirits to carry out tasks thereby ignoring God. Instead of submission to God, self pride and ego of the individual is used to order the spirits to carry out tasks such as levitation.

Levitation by non-magical means was practiced by many Jewish sages throughout the ages. As such, the forehead is the most important part of the body and is responsible for the source of "energy" bringing about the levitation. The Baal Shem Tov (הבעל שם טוב) who lived during the early eighteenth century, Was told about: "When he snapped his fingers, his chariot and horses floated tefah (8–10 centimeters) off the ground and moved at great speed, jumping on mountains and hills, until the Baal Shem Tov reached his destination" Levitation was used for long range transport of individuals who mastered this form of transportation. However Levitation as such was not a means to an end. One can not learn levitation but rather a possibility that was made available due to a state of mind that was in complete love of God and keeping his commandments (Mitzvot) to the letter.  Levitation is usually carried out by several means:
#Using the [[Wind]]: [[Solomon]] is told to get from [[God]] the ability to command everything that God created, including the wind, which mostly used to fly a carpet, no matter the weight of what's on it.
#Using one of secret names of [[God]]: Abishai was told to use one of secret names of God to prevent [[David]] from falling after brother of [[Goliath]] threw him up to the air, creating the result of levitation.
Many Jewish rabbis and sages throughout the generations also used a form of קפיצת הדרך  (Kefitzat Haderech) or "leap", which is a form of teleportation where each step taken was a distance of several miles (פרסה – literally: "horseshoe". Similar is ancient Iranian measure of distance, see [[parasang]], about 4 miles).
[[Image:Daniel-Dunglas-Home-levitation.jpg|thumb|right|The levitation of [[Daniel Dunglas Home]] at [[Ward Cheney]]'s house interpreted in a lithograph from Louis Figuier, ''Les Mystères de la science'' 1887]]

The theory of levitation is explained by being in a state of mind where a person is abstract and spiritual in relation to the material or physical world on which he stands. When abstract or spiritual inspiration and thought grows to be sufficiently strong, the abstract observation becomes physical and concrete thereby enabling the person to stand on what others normally see as abstract and imaginary. To the levitator, the abstract is as real as the ground and earth is to others. The Rabbis have decreed that a height of three cubits from the ground is an abstract perimeter in which anything below that height is considered ground level. This decree has Halachic (legal) implications. Observing this decree to the letter enables levitation at a height of three cubits by materializing this abstract perimeter to be physical and concrete as is from the standpoint of the levitator.

==Levitation by mediums==
Many [[mediumship|mediums]] have claimed to have levitated during [[séance]]s, especially in the 19th century in Britain and America. Many have been shown to be frauds, using wires and [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandon|first1=Ruth|title=The Spiritualists: The Passion for the Occult in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries|date=1984|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Buffalo, New York|isbn=9780879752699}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Dunglas Home]], a prolific and well-documented levitator of himself and other objects, was said by spiritualists to levitate outside of a window. Skeptics have disputed such claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stein|first1=Gordon|title=The Sorcerer of Kings: The Case of Daniel Dunglas Home and William Crookes|date=1993|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Buffalo, New York|isbn=9780879758639}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers [[Joseph McCabe]] and [[Trevor H. Hall]] exposed the "levitation" of Home as nothing more than him moving across a connecting ledge between two iron balconies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=F. B.|title=Review of The Enigma of Daniel Home: Medium or Fraud?, ; The Spiritualists: The Passion for the Occult in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, ; The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914|journal=Victorian Studies|date=1 January 1986|volume=29|issue=4|pages=613–614|jstor=3828547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magician [[Joseph Rinn]] gave a full account of fraudulent behavior observed in a séance of [[Eusapia Palladino]] and explained how her levitation trick had been performed. [[Milbourne Christopher]] summarized the exposure:

:"Joseph F. Rinn and Warner C. Pyne, clad in black coveralls, had crawled into the dining room of Columbia professor Herbert G. Lord's house while a Palladino seance was in progress. Positioning themselves under the table, they saw the medium's foot strike a table leg to produce raps. As the table tilted to the right, due to pressure of her right hand on the surface, they saw her put her left foot under the left table leg. Pressing down on the tabletop with her left hand and up with her left foot under the table leg to form a clamp, she lifted her foot and "levitated" the table from the floor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christopher|first1=Milbourne|authorlink=Milbourne Christopher|title=Search for the Soul|date=1979|publisher=Crowell|location=New York|isbn=9780690017601|page=47|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The levitation trick of the medium [[Jack Webber]] was exposed by the magician [[Julien Proskauer]]. According to Proskauer he would use a telescopic reaching rod attached to a trumpet to levitate objects in the séance room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Proskauer|first1=Julien J.|authorlink=Julien Proskauer|title=The Dead Do Not Talk|date=1946|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physicist [[Edmund Edward Fournier d'Albe]] investigated the medium [[Kathleen Goligher]] at many sittings and concluded that no [[paranormal]] phenomena such as levitation had occurred with Goligher and stated he had found evidence of fraud. D'Albe had claimed the [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] substance in the photographs of Goligher from her séances were made from [[muslin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fournier a'Albe|first1=Edmund Edward|authorlink=Edmund Edward Fournier d'Albe|title=The Goligher Circle|date=1922|publisher=J.

==In photography==
A person photographed while bouncing may appear to be levitating. This optical illusion is used by religious groups and by spiritualist mediums, claiming that their meditation techniques allow them to levitate in the air. You can usually find telltale signs in the photography indicating that the subject was in the act of bouncing, like blurry body parts, a flailing scarf, hair being suspended in the air, etc.&lt;ref name="Nickell"/&gt;

[[File:Holst-planets-inscription.jpg|thumb|Handwritten inscription by [[Gustav Holst]] on [[Adrian Boult]]'s copy of the score of ''[[The Planets]]'' (from liner note to EMI CD 5 66934 2)]]

'''Liner notes''' (also '''sleeve notes''' or '''album notes''') are the writings found on the sleeves of [[LP record]] albums and in booklets which come inserted into the [[compact disc]] [[jewel case]] or the equivalent packaging for vinyl records and cassettes.

==Origin==
Liner notes are descended from the notes of text that were printed on the inner sleeve used to protect a traditional 12-inch vinyl record, i.e., [[long playing]] or [[gramophone record]] [[album]]. The term descends from the name "record liner" or "[[album liner]]". Album liner notes survived format changes from vinyl LP to cassette to CD.&lt;ref&gt;Dean Biron, Writing and Music: Album Liner Notes, ''Portal: International Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies'' (Vol 8, No 1), 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

===Common material===
Such notes often contained a mix of factual and anecdotal material, and occasionally a [[discography]] for the artist or the issuing [[record label]]. Liner notes were also an occasion for thoughtful signed essays on the artist by another party, often a sympathetic [[music journalist]], a custom that has largely died out. However, the liner note ''essay'' has survived in retrospective compilations, particularly in box sets. It is also a tradition in Japan especially for foreign artist releases in Japan. Many CD liner notes include complete song lyrics for the album.

===Biographies===
Liner notes now usually include [[information]] about the [[musician]], [[lyrics]], a personnel list, and other [[credit (creative arts)|credits]] to people the musicians want to thank and people or [[record label|companies]] involved in the [[Record producer|production]] of the [[music]]. They also can give details on the extent of each musical piece, and sometimes place them in historical or social context.  Liner notes for [[European Classical Music|classical music]] recordings often provide information in several languages; if the piece includes vocal parts, they will often include a [[libretto]], possibly also translated into several languages.

===Metadata===
Liner notes sometimes provide [[metadata]] that can help when cataloguing private or public collections of sound recordings. However, the information provided on liner notes varies considerably depending on the studio or label which produced the record.

==Digital liner notes==
Increasingly and due to the rise of digital downloads, a [[digital booklet]] is being introduced to compensate for the lack of a physical booklet. [[Apple Inc.]] also introduced [[iTunes LP]] which features interactive menus instead of simple pages.

==Awards==
A [[Grammy Award for Best Album Notes]] has been given annually since 1964.

'''Nikolaos of Otranto''' (ca. 1155/60 in [[Otranto]] – February 9, 1235), also known as '''Nektarios of Casole''', was a Greek abbot and author.

Nikolaos was probably born around 1155/60. There is no record of where he received his considerable education, but it may have been at the [[monastery of Casole]]&lt;!--not any one of the 3 Casoles which have an article as of November 2012--&gt;, a very important centre of [[Greeks in Italy|Greek]] erudition in [[Apulia]] located only a few kilometres outside [[Otranto]]. In any case he became [[hieromonk]] of that monastery no later than 1205, after working as a lay teacher of Greek in his hometown.  Due to his mastery of both Latin and Greek, he served as interpreter for Cardinal [[Benedict of Sancta Susanna]] in 1205/7 and Cardinal [[Pelagius of Albano]] in 1214/5, accompanying each to the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]] for talks concerning ecclesiastical union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vasiliev |first=Alexander |authorlink=Alexander Vasiliev (historian) |title=History of the Byzantine Empire: 324–1453 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2X8LtjDLNl8C&amp;pg=PA541 |accessdate=17 November 2012 |edition=Second English |volume=II |year=1952 |lccn=52013951 |page=541}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1223/4, he was part of a diplomatic mission sent by Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] to the [[Empire of Nicaea|Byzantine court at Nicaea]], and in 1232 he represented the Greek churches of Apulia at the [[Papal Curia]] in 1232.

Nikolaos translated several texts, mostly liturgical, from Greek into Latin and vice versa; examples include the Basileios liturgy and the explanation of the liturgy written by Patriarch [[Germanos I of Constantinople]]. His other writings include original poems and letters.

==Main works==

*	The "Art of the Chisel", a collection of texts concerning various methods of divination. Nikolaos translated a Latin version of the Arabic original into Greek, and added an introduction regarding the limits of divination in Christianity.
*	Three "Syntagmata" in Greek and Latin directed against the Latin church, including several supplements. In particular, Nikolaos argued against the ''[[filioque]]'', the use of unleavened bread (azymes) for the Eucharist, and various other liturgical and disciplinary divergences.
*	The "Disputation against the Jews". This is a fictional dialogue, albeit supposedly based on real discussions between the author and a Jew. It is not only the largest and most erudite of Nikolaos' works, but also one of the most elaborate Byzantine examples of the genre.

The '''Nuer language (Thok Naath)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_nue|title=WALS Online -Language Nuer|last=|first=|date=|website=wals.info|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language]] of the [[Western Nilotic languages|Western Nilotic]] group.  It is spoken by the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] people of [[South Sudan]] and in western [[Ethiopia]] (region of [[Gambela Region|Gambela]]). Nuer is one of eastern and central Africa's most widely spoken languages, along with the [[Dinka language]]. The language is very similar to the languages of Jieng and Chollo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gurtong.net/Peoples/ThePeopleandDemographicsofSouthSudan/NuerNaath/tabid/223/Default.aspx#lang|title=Nuer (Naath)|last=Trust|first=Gurtong|website=www.gurtong.net|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuer language has a Latin-based alphabet. There are also several dialects of Nuer, although all have one written standard. For example, final {{IPA|/k/}} is pronounced in the [[Jikany Nuer|Jikany]] dialect, but is dropped in other dialects despite being indicated in Nuer orthography.

'''Pasodoble''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''double step'') is a Spanish military march, and also a modern dance that emulates the movements of a [[Bullfighting|bullfight]]. 

Essentially, the Pasadoble dance involves role-playing. This two-person dance form has the man performing as the bullfighter and the woman as the cape. It is known as one of the fastest Latin ballroom dances because dancers make around 120 to 130 beats/steps per minute. In some versions, the man portrays the [[matador]] in the dance, and the woman portrays the bull. [[flamenco |Flamenco-like]] qualities infuse the dance as the man and woman challenge each other.

Pasodoble is a lively style of [[dance]] to the [[Metre (music)|duple meter]] [[march (music)|march-like]] music. Its original form as a Spanish military march is still interpreted in the context of the [[Moros y cristianos|Moors and Christians]] festivals, in southeastern Spain, and is the major focus of current Pasodoble productions.

== History ==
The Pasodoble came from a French military march with the name "Paso Redoble". It has both Spanish and French characteristics. The steps often contain French terms, but the dance resembles the nature of the bullfight. It is believed to have emerged from southern French culture during the 1930s. The Pasodoble was a way for the French to portray the techniques used in Spanish bullfights. The name means Two-Steps and this is attributed to the marching nature of the dance.

With a binary rhythm and moderated movement, the Pasodoble was likely based on typical Spanish dances of the 16th century. During the 18th century, it was incorporated into comedies and adopted as a regulatory step for the Spanish infantry, with a special feature that makes the troops take the regular step: 120 steps per minute. The music was introduced to bullfights in the 19th century.

Famous bullfighters have been honored with Pasodoble tunes named for them. Other tunes have been inspired by patriotic motifs or local characters. The Pasodoble is well-known and used today for dance competitions.

During the early 20th century, the pasodoble became part of the repertoire of [[Italian Americans|Italian American]] musicians in San Francisco playing in the ''[[ballo liscio]]'' style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mignano Crawford |first1=Sheri |title=Mandolin Melodies |date=2008 |publisher=Zighi Baci |location=Petaluma, CA |isbn=0976372231 |pages=11-13 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four pasodobles were collected by [[Sidney Robertson Cowell]] for the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] California Folk Music Project in 1939 by [[Mexican American]] wedding party band on [[mandolin]], [[guitar]], and [[violin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cowell |first1=Sidney Robertson |url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/sidney-robertson-cowell-northern-california-folk-music/?q=pasodoble |website=California Gold: Northern California Folk Music from the Thirties Collected by Sidney Robertson Cowell |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=9 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dance ==
The Pasodoble is a fast-paced Latin American dance.

===Traditional===
[[File:Banda copia.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Amparito Roca being played by a wind band|alt=El pasodoble Amparito Roca interpretado por la Banda de Zestoa en las fiestas de 2010]]
Pasodoble is based on music played at [[Bullfighting|bullfight]]s during the bullfighters' entrance (''paseo''), or during the passes (''faena'') just before the kill. The leader of this dance plays the part of the [[matador]]. The follower generally plays the part of the matador's cape, but can also represent the shadow of the matador, as well as the [[flamenco]] dancer in some figures. The follower never represents the bull, although this is a common misconception.

===Ballroom===

Many Pasodoble songs are variations of ''[[España Cañi]]''. The song has breaks or "highlights" in fixed positions in the song (two highlights at syllabus levels,{{clarify|date=November 2010}} three highlights and a longer song at Open levels). Highlights emphasize music and are more powerful than other parts of the music. Usually, dancers strike a dramatic pose and then hold position until the end of the highlight. Traditionally, Pasodoble routines are choreographed to match these highlights, as well as the [[musical phrase]]s. Accordingly, most ballroom Pasodoble tunes are written with similar highlights (those without are simply avoided in competition).

Because of its heavily choreographed tradition, ballroom Pasodoble is danced mostly competitively, almost never socially, or without a previously learned routine. That said, in [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Vietnam]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]] and some parts of [[Germany]], it is danced socially as a led (unchoreographed) dance. In [[Venezuela]], Pasodoble is almost a must-have dance in weddings and big parties. It became especially famous thanks to the hit song "Guitarra Española" by [[Los Melódicos]].

This dance gained popularity in the US in 1930. It was too difficult to achieve widespread popularity. All moves are sharp and quick. Pasodoble takes up a lot of space, limiting it to special occasions. 

In competitive dance, modern Pasodoble is combined with other four dances ([[Samba (ballroom dance)|samba]], [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]], [[Ballroom rumba|rumba]] and [[Jive (dance)|jive]]) under the banner [[International Latin]]. Modern Pasodoble dance consists of two dancing parts and one break in between for dancers of class D and of three parts and two breaks in between for dancers of class C, B, A, according to the [[IDS Scheer|IDSF]] classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worlddancesport.org/|title=All about DanceSport at World DanceSport Federation on worlddancesport.org|website=www.worlddancesport.org|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancers of lower than D-class usually perform only four official dances of the Latin-American Program.

The '''Saliban''' (''Salivan'') languages, also known as '''Piaroa–Saliban''' or '''Saliba–Piaroan''', are a small proposed [[language family]] of the middle [[Orinoco River|Orinoco Basin]], which forms an independent island within an area of [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]] (northern ''llanos'') dominated by peoples of [[Carib languages|Carib]] and [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]] affiliation.

==Family division==
A connection between the two primary divisions, Piaroan and Sáliba, is widely assumed but has not been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald &amp; Dixon, 1999, ''The Amazonian Languages''&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Hotï language|Hotï]] is "probably" related.&lt;ref&gt;Zent S &amp; E Zent. 2008. Los Hoti, in Aborigenes de Venezuela, vol. 2, second edition [https://ivic.academia.edu/Zent/Papers/73523/Los_Jodi]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saliba language|Saliba]] is a possible language isolate; if related to Piaroa, the connection is a distant one. Piaroan is a language or dialect cluster, consisting of [[Piaroa language|Piaroa]] itself, [[Wirö dialect|Wirö]] (or "Maco"), and the extinct [[Ature language|Ature]]. The Piaroa and Wirö both consider their languages to be distinct: they can understand each other, but not reliably.

Proposals have been put forth grouping the [[Hotï language]] (Jodï) with Piaroa–Saliban in a single [[Jodï–Saliban languages|Jodï–Saliban]] family.&lt;ref&gt; Labrada, Rosés; Emilio, Jorge (2015). [http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/jodi1234 "Jodi-Saliban"]. ''[[Glottolog|Glottolog 2.7]]''. Jena: Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History.&lt;/ref&gt; Hotï was little known until recently and remains unclassified in most accounts.

'''Piyo''' (Biyo, Biyue; ''pi31 jɔ31'' (Jing 2015:11)) is a [[Loloish language]] of China. The people are ethnic [[Hani people|Hani]], and the "Bi-Ka" varieties (Biyo, [[Kaduo language|Kaduo]], [[Enu language|Enu]]) are traditionally considered dialects of Hani. However, in the classifications of Bradley (2007) and Lama (2012), they are more distinct from Hani than other related languages are. Lama classifies [[Mpi language|Mpi]] as closer to Biyo dialect than Kaduo is.

In [[Mojiang County]], the Upper Biyo (''a31 tʰa̱31 pi31 jɔ31'') and Lower Biyo (''a31 va̱31 pi31 jɔ31'') varieties are mutually intelligible (Jing 2015:11).

'''Ram Shri Mugali''' (Ranganatha Srinivasa Mugali) (15 July 1906 – 20 February 1993) was a notable writer in the [[Kannada language]]. He was awarded the prestigious central [[Sahitya Akademi award|Sahitya Akademi]] in 1956 for his work "Kannada Sahitya Charitre" in [[Kannada]]. Professor Mugali's nickname was ''Rasika Ranga'' ("Romantic Ranga"). He was the president of the 44th [[Kannada Sahitya Sammelana]] held in Siddganga, in the [[Tumkur]] district of Karnataka state, India.

==Early life ==
Mugali was born in Hole Alur in the [[Ron, Karnataka|Ron]] Taluk of [[Gadag district]], [[Karnataka]]. In 1933, he was appointed professor of Kannada at [[Willingdon College, Sangli]]. Notable among his students at Willingdon were [[Subbanna Ekkundi]] and [[Gangadhar V. Chittal]], who themselves would go on to become prominent writers in Kannada. The [[Jnanpith]] awardee [[V. K. Gokak]] was his peer at Willingdon college. In 1966, Mugali retired as a principal of the Willingdon College. From 1967 to 1970, he worked as the Head of the Kannada Department at the [[Bangalore University]], Bangalore. Mugali died in Bangalore on 20 February 1992.

The '''Reign of Terror''', or '''The Terror''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|la Terreur}}), is the label given by most historians to a period during the [[French Revolution]] after the [[First French Republic]] was established.

Several historians consider the "reign of terror" to have begun in 1793, placing the starting date at either 5 September,&lt;ref name=EncBrit&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.britannica.com/event/Reign-of-Terror |title=Reign of Terror |accessdate=19 April 2017| publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica (2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt; June&lt;ref name=Linton,port.ac/&gt; or March (birth of the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]), while some consider it to have begun in September 1792 ([[September Massacres]]), or even July 1789 (when the first lynchings took place),&lt;ref name=maudite&gt;The dates July 1789, September 1792, March 1793 as starting date for the Reign of Terror ({{lang-fr|link=no|la Terreur}}) are given in the French Wikipedia, referring to source: Jean-Clément Martin, ''La Terreur, part maudite de la Révolution'' ('The Terror, the cursed part of the Revolution'), coll. [[Découvertes Gallimard]] (n° 566), Paris: Gallimard, 2010, p. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is a consensus that it ended with [[Fall of Robespierre|the fall of Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794]].&lt;ref name=EncBrit/&gt;&lt;ref name=Linton,port.ac/&gt;

Between June 1793 and the end of July 1794, there were 16,594 official death sentences in France, of which 2,639 were in Paris.&lt;ref name=Linton,port.ac&gt;{{cite web|last=Linton|first=Marisa|title=The Terror in the French Revolution|url=http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter1/interviews/filetodownload,20545,en.pdf|publisher=Kingston University|accessdate=2 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117152123/http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter1/interviews/filetodownload%2C20545%2Cen.pdf|archivedate=17 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History Today"/&gt;

{{See also|History of France#Counter-revolution subdued (July 1793–April 1794)}}
[[File:Barere.jpg|thumb|[[Bertrand Barère]]]]

There was a sense of emergency among leading politicians in France in the summer of 1793 between the widespread civil war and counter-revolution.  [[Bertrand Barère#Political career (1789–93)|Bertrand Barère]] exclaimed on 5 September 1793 in the Convention: "Let's make terror the order of the day!"&lt;ref&gt;Noah Shusterman – ''The French Revolution. Faith, Desire, and Politics.'' Routledge, London and New York, 2014. Chapter 7 (p. 175–203): The federalist revolt, the Vendée, and the start of the Terror (summer–fall 1793).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.vendeensetchouans.com/archives/2011/08/30/21907332.html '30 août 1793 – La terreur à l'ordre du jour!'] Website Vendéens &amp; Chouans. Retrieved 6 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; They were determined to avoid street violence such as the [[September Massacres]] of 1792 by taking violence into their own hands as an instrument of government.&lt;ref name="History Today"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Linton|first1=Marisa|title=Robespierre and the terror: Marisa Linton reviews the life and career of one of the most vilified men in history. |journal=History Today|date=August  2006 | volume=8|issue=56|page=23|url=http://www.historytoday.com/marisa-linton/robespierre-and-terror| accessdate=28 April 2017|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] in February 1794 in a speech explained the necessity of terror:
{{quote|sign=|source=|If the basis of popular government in peacetime is virtue, the basis of popular government during a revolution is both virtue and terror; virtue, without which terror is baneful; terror, without which virtue is powerless. Terror is nothing more than speedy, severe and inflexible justice; it is thus an emanation of virtue; it is less a principle in itself, than a consequence of the general principle of democracy, applied to the most pressing needs of the ''patrie'' &lt;small&gt;[homeland, fatherland]&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1794robespierre.asp|title=Maximilien Robespierre: On the Principles of Political Morality, February 1794|last1=Halsall |first1=Paul|date=1997 |publisher=Fordham University |access-date=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History Today"/&gt;}}

Some historians argue that such terror was a necessary reaction to the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathiez|first1=Albert|title=La Révolution Française|publisher=Librairie Armand Colin|isbn=978-7-100-07058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest there were additional causes, including ideological&lt;ref&gt;Furet, Francois.

== Influences on the Terror ==
=== Enlightenment Thought ===

[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thought emphasized the importance of rational thinking and began challenging legal and moral foundations of society, providing the leaders of the Terror with new ideas about the role and structure of government.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Church, "Introduction", in ''The Influence of the Enlightenment on the French Revolution'', ed. William F. Church (Boston: D.C. Heath and Company, 1964), vii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s [[The Social Contract|Social Contract]] argued that each person was born with rights, and they would come together to form a government that would then protect those rights. Under the social contract, the government was required to act for the [[General will|general will]], which represented the interests of everyone rather than a few factions.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, "Ideal Empires and Republics. Rousseau's ''Social Contract'', More's ''Utopia'', Bacon's ''New Atlantis'', Campanella's ''City of the Sun'' with an Introduction by Charles M. Andrews", (Washington: M. Walter Dunne, 1901), 92–94, Online Library of Liberty, http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/rousseau-ideal-empires-and-republics.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from the idea of a general will, [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] felt that the [[French Revolution]] could result in a Republic built for the general will but only once those who fought this ideal were expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Peyre, "The Influence of Eighteenth Century Ideas on the French Revolution", in ''The Influence of the Enlightenment on the French Revolution'', ed. William F. Church (Boston: D.C. Heath and Company, 1964), 99-101.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Maximilien Robespierre, "Justification of the Use of Terror", July 28, 1794, ''Modern History Sourcebook'', Fordham University, accessed May 1, 2018, https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/robespierre-terror.asp. &lt;/ref&gt; Those who resisted the government were deemed "tyrants" fighting against the virtue and honor of the general will. The leaders felt their ideal version of government was threatened from the inside and outside of France, and terror was the only way to preserve the dignity of the Republic created from French Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Maximilien Robespierre, "Justification of the Use of Terror", July 28, 1794, ''Modern History Sourcebook'', Fordham University, accessed May 1, 2018, https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/robespierre-terror.asp. &lt;/ref&gt;

Robespierre's ideology was not strictly derived from Rousseau. The writings of another Enlightenment thinker of the time, [[Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]], greatly influenced Robespierre. One of Montesquieu’s writings, ''The Spirit of the Laws'',  defines a core principle of a democratic government: virtue. He describes it as “the love of laws and of our country.”&lt;ref&gt;Montesquieu. "Modern History Sourcebook: Montesquieu: The Spirit of the Laws, 1748." Internet History Sourcebooks. https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/montesquieu-spirit.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Robespierre’s speech to the[[National_Convention| National Convention]] on February 5, 1794, ''On Political Morality'', he talks about virtue being the “fundamental principle of popular or democratic government."&lt;ref&gt;“Robespierre, "On Political Morality",” ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity''. http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/413.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was, in fact, the same virtue defined by Montesquieu almost 50 years earlier. Robespierre believed that the virtue needed for any democratic government was extremely lacking in the French people. As a result, he decided to weed out those he believed could never possess this virtue. The result was a continual push towards Terror. The Convention used this as justification for the course of action to “crush the enemies of the revolution, ... let the laws be executed, … and let liberty be saved.”&lt;ref&gt;“"Terror Is the Order of the Day",” ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'', accessed October 26, 2018, http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/416.&lt;/ref&gt;

These members of the Enlightenment movement greatly influenced revolutionary leaders; however, cautions from other Enlightenment thinkers were blatantly ignored.   [[Voltaire|Voltaire’s]] warnings were often overlooked, though some of his ideas were used for justification of the Revolution and the start of the Terror. He protested against Catholic Dogmas and the ways of Christianity stating, “of all religions, the Christian should of course inspire the most toleration, but till now the Christians have been the most intolerant of all men.”&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire. "Voltaire, Selections from the Philosophical Dictionary." Omeka RSS. http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/273/.&lt;/ref&gt; These criticisms were often used by Robespierre and other leaders as justification for their anti-religious reforms. Voltaire also laid down some warnings. In his [[Dictionnaire_philosophique|''Philosophical Dictionary'']], he states, “we are all steeped in weakness and error; let us forgive each other our follies; that is the first law of nature” and “every individual who persecutes a man, his brother, because he is not of his opinion, is a monster."&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of forgiveness and understanding the failings of the human conditions were obviously lost on Robespierre and other leaders as they pursued Terror.

===Threats of Foreign Invasion===

After the beginning of the French Revolution, the surrounding monarchies did not show great hostility towards the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution''. 6th ed. London: Routledge, 2016. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Though mostly ignored, [[Louis_XVI_of_France|Louis XVI]] was later able to find support in Leopold II of Austria (Marie Antionette’s brother) and Frederick William II of Prussia. On August 27, 1791, these foreign leaders made the [[Declaration_of_Pillnitz|Pillnitz Declaration]] saying they would restore the French monarch if other European rulers joined.  In response to what they viewed to be the meddling of foreign powers, France declared war on April 20, 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Gunther E. Rothenberg "The Origins, Causes, and Extension of the Wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon." ''The Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' 18, no. 4 (1988): 771-93. doi:10.2307/204824. https://www.jstor.org/stable/204824.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at this point, the war was only Prussia and Austria against France. France began this war with a large series of defeats which set a precedent of fear of invasion in the people that would last throughout the war. Massive reforms of military institutions, while very effective in the long run, presented the initial problems of inexperienced forces and leaders of questionable political loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In the time it took for officers of merit to use their new freedoms to climb the chain of command, France suffered. Many of the early battles were definitive losses for the French.&lt;ref&gt;"Battle of Valmy, (20 September 1792)." Weapons and Warfare. April 09, 2018. Accessed October 30, 2018. https://weaponsandwarfare.com/2018/04/10/battle-of-valmy-20-september-1792/.&lt;/ref&gt; There was the constant threat of the Austro-Prussian forces which were advancing easily toward the capital, threatening to destroy Paris if the monarch was harmed.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold II, and Frederick William. "The Declaration of Pillnitz (1791)." French Revolution. February 27, 2018. Accessed October 26, 2018. https://alphahistory.com/frenchrevolution/declaration-of-pillnitz-1791/.&lt;/ref&gt; This series of defeats, coupled with militant uprisings and protests within the borders of France pushed the government to resort to drastic measures to ensure the loyalty of every citizen to not only France but more importantly to the Revolution.

While this series of losses was eventually broken, the reality of what might have happened if they persisted hung over France. The tide would not turn from them until September of 1792 when the French won a critical victory at Valmy preventing the Austro-Prussian invasion.&lt;ref&gt; Jermemy D. Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; While the French military had stabilized and was producing victories by the time the Reign of Terror officially began, the pressure to succeed in this international struggle acted as justification for the government to pursue its tyrannical actions. It was not until after the execution of Louis XVI and the annexation of the [[Rhineland#French_Revolution|Rhineland]] that the other monarchies began to feel threatened enough to form the [[War_of_the_First_Coalition|First Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Bloy. "The First Coalition 1793-1797."

Popkin. ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', 64.&lt;/ref&gt; As the war continued and the Reign of Terror began, leaders saw a correlation between using terror and achieving victory. Well phrased by [[Albert_Soboul|Albert Soboul]], “terror, at first an improvised response to defeat, once organized became an instrument of victory.”&lt;ref&gt;Soboul cited in Mona Ozouf. "War and Terror in French Revolutionary Discourse (1792-1794)." ''The Journal of Modern History'' 56, no. 4 (1984): 580-97. http://www.jstor.org.du.idm.oclc.org/stable/1880323.
&lt;/ref&gt; The threat of defeat and foreign invasion may have helped spur the origins of the terror, but the timely success of the Terror with French victories added justification to its growth and continuation.

=== Popular Pressure ===

During the Reign of Terror, the [[Sans-culottes|sans-culottes]] and the [[Hébertists]] put pressure on the [[National Convention]] delegates and contributed to the overall instability of France. The National Convention was bitterly split between the [[Montagnard (French Revolution)|Montagnards]] and the [[Girondins]]. The Girondins were more conservative leaders of the National Convention, while the Montagnards supported radical violence and pressures of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin, A Short History of the French Revolution, (London: Routledge, 2016), 64. &lt;/ref&gt; Once the Montagnards gained control of the National Convention, they began demanding radical measures. Moreover, the sans-culottes, the scrappy, urban workers of France, agitated leaders to inflict punishments on those who opposed the interests of the poor. The sans-culottes’ violent demonstrations pushing their demands, created constant pressure for the Montagnards to enact reform.&lt;ref&gt;"Terror, Vengeance, and Martyrdom in the French Revolution: THE CASE OF THE SHADES - Oxford Scholarship", 2014, accessed May 1, 2018, http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199959853.001.0001/acprof-9780199959853-chapter-8. 2014. &lt;/ref&gt; The sans-culottes fed the frenzy of instability and chaos by utilizing popular pressure during the Revolution. For example, the sans-culottes sent letters and petitions to the [[Committee of Public Safety]] urging them to protect their interests and rights with measures such as taxation of foodstuffs that favored workers over the rich. They advocated for arrests of those deemed to oppose reforms against those with privilege, and the more militant members would advocate pillage in order to achieve the desired equality.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Soboul, ''The Sans-culottes; the Popular Movement and Revolutionary Government, 1793–1794'', (Garden City, N.Y.: Anchor Books, 1972), 5–17.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting instability caused problems that made forming the new Republic and achieving full political support even more critical.

=== Religious Upheaval ===

The Reign of Terror was characterized by a dramatic rejection of long-held religious authority, its hierarchical structure, and the corrupt and intolerant influence of the aristocracy and clergy. Religious elements that long stood as symbols of stability for the French people, were replaced by reason and scientific thought.&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Pressense, John Lacroix,  ''Religion and the reign of terror, or, The church during the French revolution'' (World constitutions illustrated), (New York : Cincinnati: Carlton &amp; Lanahan ; Hitchcock &amp; Walden, 1869).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emmet Kennedy. A Cultural History of the French Revolution. (Yale University Press, 1989), 343. {{ISBN|9780300044263}}. &lt;/ref&gt; The radical revolutionaries and their supporters desired a cultural revolution that would rid the French state of all Christian influence.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Hunt, ''Politics, Culture and Class in the French Revolution''; chp 3, "The Imagery of Radicalism", 1984, 87–119. &lt;/ref&gt; This process began with the fall of the [[Absolute monarchy in France|monarchy]], an event that effectively defrocked the State of its sanctification by the clergy via the [[Divine right of kings|doctrine of Divine Right]] and ushered in an era of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin, ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', (London: Routledge, 2016), 72–73. &lt;/ref&gt;

Many long-held rights and powers were stripped from the Church and given to the State. In 1789, church lands were expropriated and priests killed and forced to leave France.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Hunt, ''Politics, Culture and Class in the French Revolution''; chp 3, "The Imagery of Radicalism", 1984, 87–119. &lt;/ref&gt; A [[Cult of Reason|Festival of Reason]] was held in the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]], which was renamed "The Temple of Reason", and the old traditional calendar was replaced with a new revolutionary one.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy D. Popkin, ''A Short History of the French Revolution'', (London: Routledge, 2016), 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the Terror tried to address the call for these radical, revolutionary aspirations, while at the same time trying to maintain tight control on the de-Christianization movement that was threatening to the clear majority of the still devoted Catholic population of France. The tension sparked by these conflicting objectives laid a foundation for the "justified" use of terror to achieve revolutionary ideals and rid France of the religiosity that revolutionaries believed was standing in the way.

[[File:Robespierre crop.jpg|thumb|[[Maximilien Robespierre]], member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]]]]

On 10 March 1793 the National Convention created the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. Among those charged by the tribunal, about a half were acquitted (though the number dropped to about a quarter after the enactment of the [[Law of 22 Prairial]]). In March rebellion broke out in the [[Vendée]] in response to mass conscription, which developed into a civil war that lasted until after the Terror.

On 6 April the [[Committee of Public Safety]] was created, which gradually became the de facto war-time government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-link= Hilary Mantel |last= Mantel |first= Hilary |url= http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n15/hilary-mantel/he-roared |title= He Roared |work= London Review of Books |date= 6 August 2009 |volume= 3 |issue= 15 |pages= 3–6 |accessdate= 16 January 2010 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June, the Parisian sans-culottes surrounded the National Convention, calling for administrative and political purges, a low fixed price for bread, and a limitation of the electoral [[suffrage|franchise]] to sans-culottes alone. With the backing of the [[National Guard (France)|national guard]], they persuaded the convention to arrest 29 Girondist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Peter. ''The French Revolution 1787–1804''. Pearson Education, 2003, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to the imprisonment of the Girondin deputies, some thirteen departments started the [[Federalist revolts]] against the National Convention in Paris, which were ultimately crushed. 

On 24 June, the convention adopted the first republican constitution of France, the [[French Constitution of 1793]]. It was ratified by public [[referendum]], but never put into force.

On 13 July the assassination of [[Jean-Paul Marat]] – a [[Jacobin]] leader and journalist – resulted in a further increase in Jacobin political influence. [[Georges Danton]], the leader of the [[10 August (French Revolution)|August 1792 uprising]] against the [[Louis XVI of France|king]], was removed from the committee. On July 27, 1793, Robespierre became part of the Committee of Public Safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maximilien-Robespierre|title=Maximilien Robespierre {{!}} Biography, Facts, &amp; Execution|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 23 August, the National Convention decreed the [[levée en masse]], "The young men shall fight; the married man shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn all lint into linen; the old men shall betake themselves to the public square in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic."

[[File:La fournée des Girondins 10-11-1793.jpg|thumb|left|The execution of the [[Girondins]]]]
On 9 September, the convention established paramilitary forces, the "revolutionary armies", to force farmers to surrender grain demanded by the government. On 17 September, the [[Law of Suspects]] was passed, which authorized the imprisonment of vaguely defined "suspects". This created a mass overflow in the prison systems. On 29 September, the convention extended [[price fixing]] from grain and bread to other essential goods, and also fixed wages.

On 10 October, the Convention decreed that "the provisional government shall be revolutionary until peace." On 24 October, the [[French Republican Calendar]] was enacted. The trial of the Girondins started on the same day and they were executed on 31 October.

Anti-clerical sentiments increased during 1793 and a campaign of dechristianization occurred. On 10 November (20 Brumaire Year II of the French Republican Calendar), the Hébertists organized a [[Cult of Reason|Festival of Reason]].

[[File:Olympe gouges.jpg|thumb|upright|The execution of [[Olympe de Gouges]], feminist writer close to the Girondins]]
On 14 Frimaire (5 December 1793) was passed the [[Law of Frimaire]], which gave the central government more control over the actions of the representatives on mission.

On 16 Pluviôse (4 February 1794), the National Convention decreed that slavery be abolished in all of France and French colonies.

On 8 and 13 Ventôse (26 February and 3 March), [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]] proposed decrees to confiscate the property of exiles and opponents of the revolution, known as the [[Ventôse Decrees]].

By the end of 1793, two major factions had emerged, both threatening the Revolutionary Government: the Hébertists, who called for an intensification of the Terror and threatened insurrection, and the Dantonists, led by [[Georges Danton]], who demanded moderation and clemency. The Committee of Public Safety took actions against both. The major Hébertists were tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed on 24 March. The Dantonists were arrested on 30 March, tried on 3 to 5 April and executed on 5 April.

On 20 Prairial (8 June) was celebrated across the country the Festival of the Supreme Being, which was part of the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]], a deist national religion. On 22 Prairial (10 June), the National Convention passed a law proposed by [[Georges Couthon]], known as the [[Law of 22 Prairial]], which simplified the judicial process and greatly accelerated the work of the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. With the enactment of the law, the number of executions greatly increased, and the period from this time to the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] became known as "The Grand Terror".

On 8 Messidor (26 June), the French army won the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]], which marked a turning point in France's military campaign and undermined the necessity of wartime measures and the legitimacy of the Revolutionary Government.

[[File:Execution robespierre, saint just....jpg|right|thumb|The execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]]]]

The fall of Robespierre was brought about by a combination of those who wanted more power for the Committee of Public Safety (and a more radical policy than he was willing to allow) and the moderates who completely opposed the revolutionary government. They had, between them, made the Law of 22 Prairial one of the charges against him, so that, after his fall, to advocate terror would be seen as adopting the policy of a convicted enemy of the republic, putting the advocate's own head at risk. Between his arrest and his execution, Robespierre may have tried to commit suicide by shooting himself, although the bullet wound he sustained, whatever its origin, only shattered his jaw. Alternatively, he may have been shot by the gendarme Merda. The great confusion that arose during the storming of the municipal Hall of Paris, where Robespierre and his friends had found refuge, makes it impossible to be sure of the wound's origin.
In any case, Robespierre was guillotined the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Merriman, John (2004). "Thermidor" (2nd ed.). ''A history of modern Europe: from the Renaissance to the present'', p 507. W.W. Norton &amp; Company Ltd. {{ISBN|0-393-92495-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reign of the standing Committee of Public Safety was ended. New members were appointed the day after Robespierre's execution, and limits on terms of office were fixed (a quarter of the committee retired every three months). The Committee's powers were gradually eroded.

[[File:Shakespeare-Testament.jpg|thumb|right|[[William Shakespeare]]'s will, written in a style of handwriting known as the [[secretary hand]].]]

'''[[William Shakespeare]]'s handwriting''' is known from six surviving signatures, all of which appear on legal documents — and from three pages of the handwritten manuscript of the play ''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/15/william-shakespeare-handwritten-plea-for-refugees-online-sir-thomas-more-script-play-british-library-exhibition |title=William Shakespeare's handwritten plea for refugees to go online |last=Brown |first=Mark |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=March 15, 2016 |accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/03/15/more-than-400-years-ago-shakespeare-decried-the-mountainish-inhumanity-that-refugees-had-to-face/ |title=More than 400 years ago, Shakespeare decried the ‘mountainish inhumanity’ that refugees had to face |publisher=''The Washington Post'' |last=Adam |first=Karla |date=March 15, 2016 |accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Secretary hand.jpg|thumb|This secretary alphabet is in a penmanship book by Jehan de Beau-Chesne and John Baildon published in 1570, when Shakespeare would have been five or six years old. This may have been the edition he studied as a child in grammar school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collation.folger.edu/2013/05/learning-to-write-the-alphabet/] Wolfe, Heather. Learning to Write the Alphabet. The Collation from the Folger Shakespeare Library.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Shakespeare wrote in the style known as the [[Secretary hand]].  It was native and common in England at the time, and was the cursive style taught in schools.  It is not the  italic script, which was encroaching as an alternate form (and which is more familiar to readers of today).  Shakespeare's handwriting shows a freedom to make variances in style depending on the mood or the composition being written.  The three-page addition to ''Sir Thomas More'' is written in a fluid manner, by a skillful and experienced writer.  The writing begins with indications of speed, in the manner of a scrivener, with a practiced sense of uniformity.  Then the writing style changes over to a more deliberate and heavier style, as can be seen, for example, in the speeches of Thomas More, which require greater thought and choice of words.  Throughout, the writing shows a disposition to play with the pen, to exaggerate certain curves, to use heavier downstrokes, and to finish some final letters with a small flourish.  These characteristics are more evident in the slower, deliberate sections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/shakespeareshand00polluoft#page/n85/mode/2up] Pollard, Alfred, editor. ''Shakespeare’s Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More''. Thompson, E. Maunde. “The Handwriting of the Three Pages Attributed to Shakespeare Compared with His Signatures”. page 67 - 70. Cambridge University Press (1923)&lt;/ref&gt;

The secretary hand was popular with authors. It was used by [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Francis Bacon]]. It could be written with ease and swiftness, it was conducive to the use of abbreviations, and it had a beauty in its curves as it swept across the page. As it was taught in the schools and by tutors, it allowed for great diversity — each writer could choose a style for each letter.

Shakespeare wrote with a quill in his right hand.  A quill would need to be prepared and sharpened.

[[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], who edited the [[First Folio]] in 1623, wrote that Shakespeare's "mind and hand went together, and what he thought he uttered with that easiness that we have scare received from him a blot in his papers."  In his posthumously published essay, ''Timber: Or, Discoveries'', [[Ben Jonson]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;I remember the players have often mentioned it as an honor to Shakespeare, that in his writing, whatsoever he penned, he never blotted out a line. My answer hath been, ‘Would he hath blotted a thousand,’ which they thought a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity this but for their ignorance, who chose that circumstance to commend their friend by wherein he most faulted; and to justify mine own candor, for I loved the man, and do honor his memory on this side idolatry as much as any. He was, indeed, honest, and of an open and free nature; had an excellent fancy, brave notions, and gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that facility that sometime it was necessary he should be stopped.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, Paul.

==Paleography==

Serious study of Shakespeare's handwriting began in the 18th century with scholars [[Edmond Malone]] and [[George Steevens]]. By the late nineteenth century [[paleography|paleographers]] began to make detailed study of the evidence in the hope of identifying Shakespeare's handwriting in other surviving documents. In those cases when the actual handwriting is not extant, the study of the published texts has yielded indirect evidence of his handwriting quirks through reading and apparent misreadings by compositors. To give one example of this, in the early published versions of Shakespeare's plays there occurs a recurrence of an upper case letter “C” when the lower case is called for.  This might indicate that Shakespeare was fond of such a usage in his handwriting, and that the compositors (working from the handwriting) followed the usage.  When trying to determine who the author is of either a printed work or a pen-and-ink manuscript, this is one possible method of discovering such indications.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/shakespeareshand00polluoft#page/112/mode/2up] Pollard, Alfred, editor.

There are six surviving signatures, attached to four legal documents, that are generally recognised as authentic:

* a deposition in the ''[[Bellott v Mountjoy]]'' case, dated 11 May 1612
* the purchase of a house in [[Blackfriars, London]], dated 10 March 1613
* the mortgage of the same house, dated 11 March 1613
* his Last Will and Testament, which contains three signatures, one on each page, dated 25 March 1616

The signatures appear as follows:

*Willm Shakp
*William Shakspēr
*W&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; Shakspē
*William Shakspere
*Willm Shakspere
*By me William Shakspeare

The first signature includes a short horizontal stroke above the letter “m” and a horizontal stroke or flourish in the stem of the letter “p”, which may be read as “per” or, less likely, as an indication of abbreviation. The fifth signature also contains a horizontal stroke above the letter “m”. All of his signatures are written in his native English script, which he would have learned as a young boy in school. He used the long Italian cursive letter “s” in the center of his surname, a concession to the new style, except for the fifth signature, in which he reverts to the native English long “s”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/shakespeareshand00polluoft#page/n71/mode/2up] Greg, W.W. editor.

[[File:Seals.JPG|thumb|left|upright|240px|The Blackfriars signatures are fitted into the narrow space of the seal holder]]
Three of these signatures are abbreviated versions of the surname, using [[breviograph]]ic conventions of the time, which was common practice. For example, [[Edmund Spenser]] sometimes wrote his name out in full (spelling his first name Edmund or Edmond), but often used the abbreviated forms "Ed: spser" or "Edm: spser".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Charles Hamilton (ed), ''The Spenser Encyclopedia'', University of Toronto Press, 1990, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; The signatures on the Blackfriar's document may have been abbreviated because they had to be squeezed into the small space provided by the seal-tag, which they were legally authenticating. 
 
The three signatures on the will were first reproduced by the 18th-century scholar [[George Steevens]], who copied them as accurately as he could by hand and then had his drawings engraved. The facsimiles were first printed in the 1778 edition of Shakespeare's plays, edited by Steevens and [[Samuel Johnson]].&lt;ref name = "edward"&gt;Edward Maude Thompson, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=UdFAAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study]'', Oxford, Clarendon, 1916. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the signatures led to a controversy about the proper [[spelling of Shakespeare's name]]. The paleographer [[Edward Maunde Thompson]] later criticised the Steevens transcriptions, arguing that his original drawings were inaccurate.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UdFAAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. ''Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study''. Clarendon Press (1916) page x&lt;/ref&gt;

The two signatures relating to the house sale were identified in 1768 and acquired by [[David Garrick]], who presented them to Steevens' colleague Edmond Malone. By the later nineteenth century the signatures had been photographed. Photographs of these five signatures were published by [[Sidney Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Lee, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=B1UUcEzAKXgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Shakespeare's Handwriting: Facsimiles of the Five Authentic Autograph Signatures]'', London, Smith Elder, 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final signature, on the ''Bellott v Mountjoy'' deposition, was discovered by 1909 by [[Charles William Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Charles William, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=B0hFAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Shakespeare and his London Associates]," ''Nebraska University Studies'', October 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published by him in the March 1910 issue of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' and reprinted in the October 1910 issue of ''Nebraska University Studies''.

==Handwriting analysis==
[[Image:Sir Thomas More Hand D.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Facsimile of a page written by 'Hand D', in all likelihood written by William Shakespeare]]
Although some scholars took note of, and reproduced, Shakespeare's handwriting as early as the 18th century,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; the paleographer [[Edward Maunde Thompson|Sir Edward Maunde Thompson]] wrote in 1916 that the subject of Shakespeare's handwriting had “never been subjected to a thorough and systematic study.” One reason for this neglect is that the only examples of Shakespeare's handwriting that were known to earlier scholars were five authentic signatures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UdFAAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. ''Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study''. Clarendon Press (1916) page 1&lt;/ref&gt; A further difficulty was that three of the known signatures were written in the last weeks of Shakespeare's life, when he may have been suffering from a tremor or otherwise enfeebled by illness, and the other two had been written under conditions that restrained free movement of the hand. Those signed to the Blackfrairs mortgage had to be squeezed into the narrow space of the seal.&lt;ref name = "emt"&gt;E.M. Thompson, ''Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study'', Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1916, p. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the circumstances, with evidence limited to those five signatures, an attempt to reconstitute the handwriting that Shakespeare actually used might have been considered impossible. But then in 1910, the discovery of the sixth signature on the ''Bellott v Mountjoy'' deposition changed all this. This signature was written with a free hand, and it was the key to an important part of the problem. Thompson identified distinctive characteristics in Shakespeare's hand, which include delicate introductory upstrokes of the pen, the use of the Italian long “s” in the middle of his surname in his signatures, an unusual form of the letter “k”, and a number of other personal variations.&lt;ref&gt;S. Schoenbaum, ''A Documentary Life,'' Oxford University Press/Scolar Press, 1975 p.157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UdFAAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. ''Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study''. Clarendon Press (1916) page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The first time it was suggested that the three-page addition to the play ''Sir Thomas More'' was composed and also written out by William Shakespeare was in a correspondence to the publication ''Notes and Queries'' in July 1871 by [[Richard Simpson (writer)|Richard Simpson]], who was not an expert in handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UdFAAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] Simpson, Richard.  in a correspondence “Are there any extant MSS in Shakespeare’s handwriting?” written to ''Notes and Queries'', 4th Series, volume viii, p. 1 (1 July 1871) Referenced and quoted in: Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. ''Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study''. Clarendon Press (1916) pages xii &amp; 38&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson's note was titled: "Are there any extant MSS in Shakespeare’s handwriting?" His idea received little serious attention for a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UdFAAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. ''Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study''. Clarendon Press (1916) page xii&lt;/ref&gt; After more than a year [[James Spedding]] wrote to the same publication in support of that particular suggestion by Simpson, saying that the handwriting found in ''Sir Thomas More'' "agrees with [Shakespeare’s] signature, which is a simple one, and written in the ordinary character of the time."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UdFAAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] Spedding, James. ''Notes and Queries'', 4th Series, (21 September 1872) Referenced and quoted in: Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. ''Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study''. Clarendon Press (1916) page 39&lt;/ref&gt;

After a detailed study of the ''More'' script, which included analysing every letter formation, and then comparing it to the signatures, Thompson concluded that "sufficient close resemblances have been detected to bring the two handwritings together and to identify them as coming from one and the same hand," and that "in this addition to the play of ''Sir Thomas More'' we have indeed the handwriting of William Shakespeare."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UdFAAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. ''Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study''. Clarendon Press (1916) page 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum, ''A Documentary Life,'' p.158:'The cumulative evidence for Shakespeare's hand in the 'More' fragment may not be sufficient to shake away all doubts – but who else in this period formed an ''a'' with a horizontal spur, spelt ''silence'' as ''scilens,'' and had identical associative patterns of thought and image? All roads converge on Shakespeare'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson believed that the first two pages of the script were written quickly, using writing techniques that indicate Shakespeare had received "a more thorough training as a scribe than had been thought probable". These pages contain abbreviations and contractions of words which were "in common use among lawyers and trained secretaries of the day."  These pages show more of the characteristics of "the scrivener", but the third page, having been written with slower deliberation, reveals more of Shakespeare's own quirks, or, as he put it, "more of the hand of the author". In addition there are in the three pages suggestions of a "tendency to formality and ornamental calligraphy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UdFAAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. ''Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study''. Clarendon Press (1916) page 55-56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editor’s interpretations==
[[File:Three lines from the play, "Sir Thomas More".jpg|thumb|From the play, ''Sir Thomas More'': 
"but chartered unto them, what would you think 
to be thus used, this is the strangers case
and this your mountanish inhumanity"]]
The problems editors or compositors can face when transforming the handwritten manuscript into the printed page are demonstrated in the printed edition of ''Sir Thomas More'', edited in 1990 by Gabrieli and Melchiori.  In the following line spoken by More addressing the mob: “This is the strangers’ case, and this your mountanish inhumanity,” the reading of the word “mountanish” is supported by references in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' and ''[[Cymbeline]]''. However, in the handwritten manuscript by Hand D, the “un” in the word has only three strokes, or minims, which makes it look like an “m”: as “momtanish”. So the word has been read by modern editors as “moritanish” (referring to the inhabitants of [[Mauritania]]), or as "momtanish" (a contraction of “Mohamadanish” - referring to the followers of [[Mohammad]]), or as “mountainish” (suggesting huge and uncivil), as well as other readings and spellings.&lt;ref&gt;Munday, Anthony and others.

==Handwriting thought by some to be Shakespeare's==
=== A possible seventh signature on the book ''Archaionomia''===
[[File:Shakespeare signature Archaionomia.jpg|thumb|right|Signature discovered on the title page of Lambarde's ''Archaionomia''. This is a reversed photograph of the ink that seeped through to the verso side of the page, the image was reversed so that the signature reads in the legible direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collation.folger.edu/2012/03/spectral-imaging-of-shakespeares-seventh-signature/] Easton, Roger L. jr. “Spectral Imaging of Shakespeare’s Seventh Signature”. ''The Collation; a Gathering of Scholarship from the Folger Shakespeare Library''. March 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the late 1930s a possible seventh Shakespeare signature was found in the Folger Library copy of [[William Lambarde]]'s ''Archaionomia'' (1568), a collection of Anglo-Saxon laws. In 1942, [[Giles Dawson]] published a report cautiously concluding that the signature was genuine, and 30 years later he concluded that there was "an overwhelming probability that the writer of all seven signatures was the same person, William Shakespeare."&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Giles. "A Seventh Signature for Shakespeare." ''Shakespeare Quarterly'' 43 (Spring 1992): 72–79, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Knight published a book-length study a year later with the same conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, W. Nicholas. ''Shakespeare's Hidden Life: Shakespeare at the Law 1585-1595''. New York: Mason &amp; Lipscomb, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Schoenbaum]] considered that the signature was more likely to be genuine than not with "a better claim to authenticity than any other pretended Shakespeare autograph," while also writing that "it is premature ... to classify it as the poet's seventh signature."&lt;ref&gt;Schoenbaum, Samuel. ''William Shakespeare: Records and Images''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley Wells notes that the authenticity of both the Montaigne and Lambarde signatures have had strong support.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Stanley (2001).

In 2012 Gregory Heyworth, as head of the ''Lazarus Project'', which has a mission to use advance technology to create images of culturally important artifacts, along with his students at the [[University of Mississippi]], used a 50-megapixel multispectral digital imaging system to enhance the signature and get a better idea of what it looked like.&lt;ref&gt;Pappas, Stephanie.

===The body of Shakespeare’s last will and testament===
The first person to claim that the body of Shakespeare's last will and testament was written in Shakespeare's own handwriting was [[John Cordy Jeaffreson]], who compared the letters in the will and in the signature, and then expressed his findings in a letter to ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' (1882).  He suggests that the will was intended to be a rough draft, and that the progressively deteriorating script indicates an enfeebling illness, an illness which may have caused the “rough draft” to become the will itself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3J4zAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA509&amp;dq=John+Cordy+Jeaffreson%2Bshakespeare&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIs8_GqpPcxgIVwzg-Ch1wRwB3#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Cordy%20Jeaffreson%2Bshakespeare&amp;f=false] Elze, Karl. ''William Shakespeare: A Literary Biography''. Publisher: G. Bell &amp; Sons. (1888) page 509&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ij5IAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=John+Cordy+Jeaffreson%2Bshakespeare&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwB2oVChMIs8_GqpPcxgIVwzg-Ch1wRwB3#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Cordy%20Jeaffreson%2Bshakespeare&amp;f=false] Jeaffreson, John Cordy. ''A Book of Recollections, Volume 2''. Hurst and Blackett (1894) Page 227&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Pym Yeatman]] is another who considered that the body of the will is in Shakespeare's handwriting.  In his book, ''Is William Shakespeare’s Will Holographic?'' (1901), he argues against the often repeated idea that Francis Collins (or "Francis Collyns" as it is often spelled), Shakespeare's lawyer, wrote the will.  Among the evidence that Yeatman offers, is Collins' signature on the will itself. Collins’ name occurs three times in the will: twice in the body, and the third time when Collyns signs his name at the bottom of page three.  The body of the will, along with Shakespeare's own signature, are written in handwriting known as the [[secretary hand]], whereas the signature by Collins, particularly the initial letters, is written in a modern hand. The difference between the two handwriting styles is primarily in the formations used for each letter of the alphabet. Yeatman then states that the last insertion regarding the second-best bed, is in a handwriting that "exactly corresponds with the signature below it."  This he adds, is "of the utmost value, in proof that one hand wrote them both."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m8UfxJ-7k6wC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=%22Is+William+Shakespeare’s+Will+Holographic?%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pYWynGuhcN&amp;sig=ZXRX1IuRrw2RQaPLgF5uUdP1urs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAmoVChMI58zEv5XcxgIVRB0-Ch2s1wVa#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Is%20William%20Shakespeare’s%20Will%20Holographic%3F%22&amp;f=false] Yeatman, J. Pym. ''Is William Shakespeare’s Will Holographic?'' Published by the author. (1901) page 12&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The name "Francis Collyns" taken from Shakespeare's will.png|thumb| Above: The name of the lawyer "Francis Collins" as it appears in the body of the will. 
Below: Collins' signature on the will.]]

In 1985 manuscript expert [[Charles Hamilton (handwriting expert)|Charles Hamilton]],  compared the signatures, the handwritten additions to the play ''Sir Thomas More'', and the body of the last will and testament. In his book ''In Search of Shakespeare'' he placed letters from each document side-by-side to demonstrate the similarities and his reasons for considering that they were written by the same hand.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Charles. ''In Search of Shakespeare: A Reconnaissance Into the Poet's Life and Handwriting''. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (1985) {{ISBN|9780151445349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The handwriting in the body of Shakespeare's last will and testament indicates that it is written all by one person in at least two sessions: First the entire will of three pages, then a revision on the lower half of the first page that runs over onto page 2, and finally the additions or bequests that are inserted between the lines.  The lower half of page one, the part that was written later than page 2 and 3, shows a disintegration of the penmanship. This problem worsens until the last written line, leaving his second-best bed to his wife, is almost indecipherable.  The ink used for the interlinear additions is different from the ink in the main body of the will, but it is the same ink that is used by the four witnesses that signed the will.&lt;ref&gt;Tannenbaum, Samuel A. ''Reclaiming One of Shakspere’s Signature''. University of North Carolina Press (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Edmund K. ''William Shakespeare: A study of Facts and Problems''.  Oxford: Clarendon Press. Volume 2, page 173 (1930)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handwriting in a letter signed by the Earl of Southampton===
The Shakespearean scholar, [[Eric Sams]] points to a letter written by the 20-year-old [[Earl of Southampton]] to a Mr. Hicks (or Hyckes) regarding [[Lord Burghley]], at a time when Southampton had not yet agreed to marry Burghley's granddaughter.  The letter is signed by the Earl of Southampton, but the body of the letter was written by someone else.  It is dated 26 June 1592, a year when it is thought that Shakespeare may have first encountered Southampton and had begun writing the sonnets.  Sams notices that the handwriting in the body of the letter is literally a secretary hand, and it resembles the handwriting found in the addition to ''Sir Thomas More'' by Hand D. After close scrutiny of the letters and pen strokes in each, and referencing the detailed descriptions found in Edward Thompson's ''Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study'', Sams finds that there are enough similarities to merit further consideration. This letter was written by Southampton regarding one of his houses that was in need of repair, and as Eric Sams points out, it was written at a time when Southampton was the recipient of sonnets written by Shakespeare that contained imagery suggesting the young lord might consider repairing his house: “Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate/Which to repair should be thy chief desire.” (Sonnet 10, lines 7-8)  And “who lets so fair a house fall to decay?” (Sonnet 13, line 9)&lt;ref&gt;Sams, Eric.

===A signature on a deed for the purchase of a house===
[[File:Judith Shakespeare signatures.jpg|thumb|300px|Judith Shakespeare's mark, a squiggle with two loops. Her given name and surname were added on either side of her mark.]]
On 4 December 1612 Shakespeare's friends, Elizabeth and Adrian Quiney, sold a house to a man named William Mountford for 131 pounds.  The deed of sale, written out apparently by a legal clerk, was witnessed and signed twice in different parts of the deed by William Shakespeare's daughter, Judith, who used for her signature a squiggle with two loops in it.  Judith's given name and surname were written out on either side of Judith's marks, by someone who was not the clerk, or the witnesses or the signers. Paleographer [[Charles Hamilton (handwriting expert)|Charles Hamilton]] studied this document and found that Judith's surname as it is written out is so similar to the surname in Shakespeare's own signature as it appears on other documents, that it may be reasonable to consider that Shakespeare could have been there at the signing of the deed, and assisted his daughter as she made her mark. Hamilton considers that there may be reasons for Shakespeare not witnessing the document himself. For example, he could have been involved in some way that would have precluded him from acting as witness, either in the drawing up of the deed or in advising the Quineys.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Charles. ‘’In Search of Shakespeare: A Reconnaissance Into the Poet's Life and Handwriting’’.

===The applications to grant a coat-of-arms to John Shakespeare===
[[File:Shakespeare coat-of-arms.jpg|thumb|A pen-and-ink sketch of Shakespeare's shield drawn on the first rough draft of the application to grant a coat-of-arms to John Shakespeare.]]
On 20 October 1596 a rough draft was drawn up for an application to the College of Heralds for Shakespeare's father to be granted a coat-of-arms.  This draft has numerous emendations and corrections, and it appears to have been written by someone "inexperienced in drawing up heraldic drafts."&lt;ref name="R1DAQAAMAAJ 1908"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pR1DAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=tannenbaum+%22shakespeare+coat+of+arms%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A4Oh9P9v7_&amp;sig=2tXz3j67vSFbWA57eTdq7OFEOGI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwDGoVChMIvsfhluLhxgIVyBo-Ch1uMwBb#v=onepage&amp;q=tannenbaum%20%22shakespeare%20coat%20of%20arms%22&amp;f=false] Tannenbaum, Samuel, A.  ''The Shakespeare Coat-of-Arms''. The Tenny Press (1908) {{ISBN|978-0404063368}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The script is written at a great speed, but with the fluid, easy character of one well practiced with a quill. The velocity of the writing is increased by shortcuts and abbreviations.  Formalities of punctuation and consistent spelling are left behind, as words are pared down.  Loops and tails are sheared, and letters are flattened for speed.  The handwriting slows down only to produce a clearly legible italic script for proper nouns and family names.  Later that day, the same person drew up a second rough draft based on the first one, incorporating the edits that were indicated in the previous draft. This application was ultimately successful, and the coat-of-arms was granted.

A third application was drafted three years later in 1599.  This time it was applying to have impaled onto Shakespeare's coat-of-arms, the arms of the Ardens of Wilmcote, Shakespeare's mother's family. All three drafts include a pen-and-ink sketch of the proposed coat-of-arms: a shield, with a spear, surmounted by a falcon standing on its left leg, grasping a spear with its right talon. The coat-of-arms is seen to be pictorially expressing Shakespeare's name with the verb "shake" shown by the falcon with its fluttering wings grasping a "spear".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pR1DAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=tannenbaum+%22shakespeare+coat+of+arms%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A4Oh9P9v7_&amp;sig=2tXz3j67vSFbWA57eTdq7OFEOGI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwDGoVChMIvsfhluLhxgIVyBo-Ch1uMwBb#v=onepage&amp;q=Furnivall&amp;f=false] Tannenbaum, Samuel Aaron.

''The Journal of the Society of Archivist and Autograph Collectors, No. 1''. (1895).&lt;/ref&gt;

William Dethick is mentioned in all the application drafts, as the “Garter-Principal king of Arms in England”. It has been suggested that Dethick wrote the drafts,&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, D.H. ''Shakespeare Documents: Cartae Shakespeareanae'' (1904)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Stephen, editor. The Assignment of Arms to Shakespeare and Arden (1884)&lt;/ref&gt; but Dethick's handwriting, a combination of secretary and italic scripts, appears to be quite different.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Charles. ''In Search of Shakespeare: A Reconnaissance Into the Poet's Life and Handwriting''. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (1985) {{ISBN|9780151445349}} page 137&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that Shakespeare himself made out the applications, and that it is his handwriting on the rough drafts, was raised by Samuel A. Tannenbaum.&lt;ref name="R1DAQAAMAAJ 1908"/&gt; Paleantologist Charles Hamilton considering this, published illustrations for comparison by placing words and letters from the applications side-by-side with words and letters from the additions by Hand D in the play, ''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]'', and other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Charles. ''In Search of Shakespeare: A Reconnaissance Into the Poet's Life and Handwriting''. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (1985) {{ISBN|9780151445349}} page 144&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Edward III''===

Though the playwright's handwriting for ''[[Edward III (play)|Edward III]]'' has not survived, the text, as printed, has been analyzed in order to discover indications of characteristics that the handwriting might contain, in the same way that the ''First Folio'' and other printed texts have been scrutinized.&lt;ref name="Fgbd7wC 1996 page 192"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z40g4Fgbd7wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22eric+sams%22+%22edward+III%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIib_s6pjoxgIVBII-Ch1ZHA3R#v=onepage&amp;q=%22eric%20sams%22%20%22edward%20III%22&amp;f=false] Sams, Eric. ''Shakespeare’s Edward III''. Yale University Press.  (1996) {{ISBN|9780300066265}}. page 192&lt;/ref&gt;

This has led to findings that may support the attribution of this play to Shakespeare. For example, scholar [[Eric Sams]], assuming that the pages by Hand D in the play, ''Sir Thomas More'' are indeed Shakespeare's, points out that Hand D shows what scholar [[Alfred W. Pollard]] refers to as “excessive carelessness” in minim errors — that is, writing the wrong number of downstrokes in the letters i, m, n, and u.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/shakespeareshand00polluoft#page/n85/mode/2up] Pollard, Alfred, editor. ''Shakespeare’s Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More''. Cambridge University Press (1923) page 117&lt;/ref&gt; This particular characteristic is indicated in numerous misreadings by the original compositor who set the printed type for ''Edward III''. This is also found in the Good Quartos,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/shakespeareshand00polluoft#page/n85/mode/2up] Pollard, Alfred, editor. ''Shakespeare’s Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More''. Cambridge University Press (1923) page 117-118&lt;/ref&gt; which are thought to be printed from Shakespeare's handwritten manuscripts. For a second example, Hand D uses a short horizontal stroke above a letter to indicate contraction, but twice omits it. This characteristic is indicated by the compositor's misreadings in a number of instances found in ''Edward III''. And in another example, Hand D and the Good Quartos often show “the frequent and whimsical appearance of an initial capital C, in a way which shows that Shakespeare’s pen was fond of using this letter in place of the minuscule."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/shakespeareshand00polluoft#page/n85/mode/2up] Pollard, Alfred, editor. ''Shakespeare’s Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More''. Cambridge University Press (1923) page 115&lt;/ref&gt; This characteristic occurs throughout both the ''Sonnets'' and ''Edward III''.&lt;ref name="Fgbd7wC 1996 page 192"/&gt;

==Forgeries==

=== The Ireland Shakespeare forgeries ===
In London in the 1790s the author, [[Samuel Ireland]], announced a great discovery of Shakespearean manuscripts, including four plays. This turned out to be [[Ireland Shakespeare forgeries|a hoax]] created with great effort by his son, William Henry Ireland.  It fooled many experts, caused great excitement, and a production of one of the plays was announced.  Shakespearean scholar Edmond Malone was one who was not taken in. The forged handwriting and signatures bore little or no resemblance to Shakespeare's.  Malone said it was a clumsy fraud filled with errors and contradictions, and detailed his reasons. William Henry Ireland eventually confessed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/to-beor-not-the-greatest-shakespeare-forgery-136201/?no-ist] Stewart, Doug. “To Be...Or Not: The Greatest Shakespeare Forgery” Smithsonian Magazine. June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A forged signature on a book by Montaigne===
[[File:montaigne shake sig.JPG|thumb|The alleged signature in Florio's translation of Montaigne.]]

On a loose fly-leaf of a copy of [[John Florio]]’s translation of the works of [[Montaigne]], is a signature that reads "Willm. Shakspere”.  The signature is now widely recognized as a poor forgery, but it has taken in scholars in the past. The book's first known owner was the Reverend Edward Patteson, who lived in the 1780s in Staffordshire, a few miles from Stratford-upon-Avon.  The book was auctioned for a large amount (100 pounds) in 1838 to a London bookseller named Pickering, who then sold it to the British Museum. [[Frederic Madden]] accepted it as authentic in his pamphlet ''Observations on an Autograph of Shakspere and the Orthography of his name'' (1838),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NpwNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%22Observations+on+an+Autograph+of+Shakspere+and+the+Orthography+of+his+name%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0OIAuAZ231&amp;sig=WgVpOhS6TMN3MiC9mRcJu3hgYIQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YZKjVZnCNcWke72WnogL&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Montaigne&amp;f=false] Madden, Frederick. ''Observations on an autograph of Shakspere, and the orthography of his name.'' Oxford University (1838)&lt;/ref&gt; and so did [[Samuel A. Tannenbaum]] in his essay “Reclaiming One of Shakspere’s Signatures” (1925).&lt;ref&gt;Tannenbaum, Samuel A. “Reclaiming One of Shakspere’s Signatures” University of North Carolina Press (1925)&lt;/ref&gt; Others, including John Louis Haney writing in 1906, were not taken in.  A close consideration and analysis of the signature and each letter shows it to differ markedly from any of the authentic signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Charles. ''In Search of Shakespeare: A Reconnaissance Into the Poet's Life and Handwriting''.

[[File:Centenary plaque sheaf.JPG|thumb|A sheaf of grain on a plaque]]

A '''sheaf''' is a bunch of cereal-crop stems bound together after [[reaping]], traditionally by [[sickle]], later by [[scythe]], now generally by a mechanical [[reaper-binder]] after its introduction in 1872. &lt;br&gt;

Traditional hand-reapers, using scythes and working as a team, cut a field of grain clockwise, starting from an outside edge and finishing in the middle.  Scything leaves a [[windrow]] of cut stems to the left of the reaper and, if cut skillfully, leaves the seed heads more or less aligned.  These are then picked up and tied into sheaves by following workers using other cut stems as ties.  These workers, or a following team, then stand the sheaves up in [[stook]]s to dry.

A sheaf stook is self-supporting, well-ventilated for drying, and comprises about eight sheaves built upright in an A shape with their seed-heads meeting at the top: this keeps the heads off the ground, allows the grain to dry and discourages vermin.
The drying sheaves are later either placed by hand or pitched onto a cart. The traditional sheaf [[pitchfork]] has a long wooden handle, two short tynes and a rounded back to make the placing of sheaves easy. The gathered sheaves are then either built into stacks (thatched stacks could be over 20' high&lt;ref&gt;[[Haystacks (Monet series)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=March 2018}}) or taken to a barn for further drying before being threshed to separate the grain from the stems.

The mechanisation of agriculture in industrialised countries, in particular the introduction of the [[combine harvester]] from the middle of the 19th century, has made the sheaf redundant but sheaves remain in widespread use wherever harvesting is still done by hand or by reaper-binder.

'''Stuttering''', also known as '''stammering''', is a [[speech disorder]] in which the flow of [[speech]] is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words or phrases as well as involuntary silent pauses or blocks in which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/F98.5 World Health Organization ICD-10 F95.8 – Stuttering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102133725/http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en |date=2014-11-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''stuttering'' is most commonly associated with involuntary sound repetition, but it also encompasses the abnormal hesitation or pausing before speech, referred to by people who stutter as ''blocks'', and the prolongation of certain sounds, usually [[vowel]]s or [[semivowel]]s. According to Watkins et al., stuttering is a disorder of "selection, initiation, and execution of motor sequences necessary for fluent speech production".&lt;ref name="Carlson, N. 2013 pp. 497-500"&gt;[Carlson, N. (2013). Human Communication. In Physiology of behavior (11th ed., pp. 497–500). Boston: Allyn and Bacon.]&lt;/ref&gt; For many people who stutter, repetition is the primary problem. The term "stuttering" covers a wide range of severity, encompassing barely perceptible impediments that are largely cosmetic to severe [[symptoms]] that effectively prevent [[oral communication]]. In the world, approximately four times as many men as women stutter, encompassing 70 million people worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 Facts About Stuttering|url=https://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-stuttering|accessdate=15 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719081755/https://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-stuttering|archivedate=19 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about 1% of the world's population.&lt;ref name="Carlson, N. 2013 pp. 497-500"/&gt;

The impact of stuttering on a person's functioning and emotional state can be severe. This may include fears of having to [[elocution|enunciate]] specific vowels or consonants, fears of being caught stuttering in social situations, self-imposed isolation, anxiety, stress, shame, low self-esteem, being a possible target of bullying (especially in children), having to use word substitution and rearrange words in a sentence to hide stuttering, or a feeling of "loss of control" during speech. Stuttering is sometimes popularly seen as a symptom of anxiety, but there is actually no direct correlation in that direction (though as mentioned the inverse can be true, as social anxiety may actually develop in individuals as a result of their stuttering).{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Stuttering is generally not a problem with the physical production of speech sounds or putting thoughts into words. Acute nervousness and stress do not cause stuttering, but they can trigger stuttering in people who have the speech disorder, and living with a stigmatized disability can result in [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and high [[Allostatic load|allostatic stress load]] (chronic nervousness and stress) that reduce the amount of acute stress necessary to trigger stuttering in any given person who stutters, exacerbating the problem in the manner of a [[positive feedback]] system; the name 'stuttered speech syndrome' has been proposed for this condition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stutteredspeechsyndrome.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208102736/http://stutteredspeechsyndrome.com/ |date=2011-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Irwin|first=M.|editor1-first=J.|editor1-last=Au-Yeung|editor2-first=M.

The disorder is also ''variable'', which means that in certain situations, such as talking on the telephone or in a large group, the stuttering might be more severe or less, depending on whether or not the stutterer is self-conscious about their stuttering. Stutterers often find that their stuttering fluctuates and that they have "good" days, "bad" days and "stutter-free" days. The times in which their stuttering fluctuates can be random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowen|first=Caroline|title=Information for Families: Stuttering- What can be done about it?|url=http://speech-language-therapy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=101:stuttering&amp;catid=11:admin&amp;Itemid=101|work=speech-language-therapy dot com|accessdate=June 19, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402150955/http://speech-language-therapy.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=101:stuttering&amp;catid=11:admin&amp;Itemid=101|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exact [[etiology]], or cause, of stuttering is unknown, both [[genetics]] and [[neurophysiology]] are thought to contribute.

The severity of the person's stuttering would correspond to the amount of speech therapy needed to decrease disfluency.

==Characteristics==

===Primary behaviors===
Primary stuttering behaviors are the overt, observable signs of speech disfluencies, including repeating sounds, syllables, words or phrases, silent blocks and prolongation of sounds. These differ from the normal dysfluencies found in all speakers in that stuttering dysfluencies may last longer, occur more frequently, and are produced with more effort and strain.&lt;ref name="Ward5–6"&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuttering dysfluencies also vary in quality: common dysfluencies tend to be repeated movements, fixed postures, or superfluous behaviors. Each of these three categories is composed of subgroups of stutters and dysfluencies.&lt;ref name="Teesson, K. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Teesson K, Packman A, Onslow M |title=The Lidcombe Behavioral Data Language of stuttering |journal=Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=1009–15 |date=August 2003  |pmid=12959476 |url=http://jslhr.pubs.asha.org/Article.aspx?volume=46&amp;page=1009 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2003/078)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Repeated movements&lt;ref name="Teesson, K. 2003"/&gt;
** Syllable repetition—a single syllable word is repeated (for example: on—on—on a chair) or a part of a word which is still a full syllable such as "un—un—under the..." and "o—o—open".
** Incomplete syllable repetition—an incomplete syllable is repeated, such as a consonant without a vowel, for example, "c—c—c—cold".
** Multi-syllable repetition—more than one syllable such as a whole word, or more than one word is repeated, such as "I know—I know—I know a lot of information.".
* Fixed postures&lt;ref name="Teesson, K. 2003"/&gt; 
** With audible airflow—prolongation of a sound occurs such as "mmmmmmmmmom".
** Without audible airflow—such as a block of speech or a tense pause where nothing is said despite efforts. 
*Superfluous behaviors&lt;ref name="Teesson, K. 2003"/&gt;
** Verbal—this includes an interjection such as an unnecessary ''uh'' or ''um'' as well as revisions, such as going back and correcting one's initial statements such as "I—My girlfriend...", where the ''I'' has been corrected to the word ''my''.
** Nonverbal—these are visible or audible speech behaviors, such as lip smacking, throat clearing, head thrusting, etc., usually representing an effort to break through or circumvent a block or stuttering loop.

===Variability===
The severity of a stutter is often not constant even for people who severely stutter. People who stutter commonly report dramatically decreased disfluency when talking in unison with another speaker, copying another's speech, whispering, singing, and acting or when talking to pets, young children, or themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other situations, such as public speaking and speaking on the telephone, are often greatly feared by people who stutter, and increased stuttering is reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feelings and attitudes===
Stuttering could have a significant negative cognitive and affective impact on the person who stutters.  It has been described in terms of the [[analogy]] to an [[iceberg]], with the immediately visible and audible symptoms of stuttering above the [[waterline]] and a broader set of symptoms such as negative [[emotion]]s hidden below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kalinowski|Saltuklaroglu|2006| p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feelings of [[embarrassment]], [[shame]], [[frustration]], [[fear]], [[anger]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] are frequent in people who stutter,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may actually increase tension and effort, leading to increased stuttering.&lt;ref name="Guitar16–7"&gt;{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|pp=16–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; With time, continued exposure to difficult speaking experiences may crystallize into a negative self-concept and self-image. Many perceive stutterers as less intelligent due to their disfluency; however,  as a group, individuals who stutter tend to be of above average intelligence.&lt;ref name="guardianlv.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guardianlv.com/2013/08/stuttering-children-more-intelligent-according-to-new-study-video/|title=Stuttering Children More Intelligent According to New Study [Video]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024161655/http://guardianlv.com/2013/08/stuttering-children-more-intelligent-according-to-new-study-video/|archivedate=2014-10-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person who stutters may project his or her attitudes onto others, believing that they think he or she is nervous or stupid. Such negative feelings and attitudes may need to be a major focus of a treatment program.&lt;ref name="Guitar16–7"/&gt;

Many people who stutter report a high [[emotion]]al cost, including jobs or [[promotion (rank)|promotions]] not received, as well as [[romance (love)|relationships]] broken or not pursued.&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, Andrew. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/health/12stutt.html To Fight Stuttering, Doctors Look at the Brain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109144520/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/12/health/12stutt.html |date=2016-11-09 }}", ''New York Times'', September 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluency and disfluency===
Linguistic tasks can invoke [[speech disfluency]].  People who stutter may experience varying disfluency.&lt;ref name="Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA." /&gt;  Tasks that trigger disfluency usually require a controlled-language processing, which involves linguistic planning. In stuttering, it is seen that many individuals do not demonstrate disfluencies when it comes to tasks that allow for automatic processing without substantial planning. For example, singing "Happy Birthday" or other relatively common, repeated linguistic discourses, could be fluid in people who stutter.  Tasks like this reduce semantic, syntactic, and prosodic planning, whereas spontaneous, "controlled" speech or reading aloud requires thoughts to transform into linguistic material and thereafter [[syntax]] and [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]].  Some researchers hypothesize that controlled-language activated circuitry consistently does not function properly in people who stutter, whereas people who do not stutter only sometimes display disfluent speech and abnormal circuitry.&lt;ref name="Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA."&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(00)02547-2 |last=Sandak|first=R|title=Stuttering: a view from neuroimaging|volume=356|journal=The Lancet|pages=445–446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
No single, exclusive cause of developmental stuttering is known. A variety of hypotheses and theories suggests multiple factors contributing to stuttering.&lt;ref name="gordon"/&gt; Among these is the strong evidence that stuttering has a genetic basis.&lt;ref name="Guitar5–6"&gt;{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|pp= 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who have first-degree relatives who stutter are three times as likely to develop a stutter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Twin study|twin]] and adoption studies suggest that genetic factors interact with environmental factors for stuttering to occur,&lt;ref name="Guitar66"&gt;{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|p= 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many people who stutter have no family history of the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|p= 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is evidence that stuttering is more common in children who also have concurrent speech, language, learning or motor difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert West, a pioneer of genetic studies in stuttering, has suggested that the presence of stuttering is connected to the fact that articulated speech is the last major acquisition in human evolution.&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West | first1=R.|last2=Nelson|first2=S.|last3=Berry|first3=M.|year = 1939 |title =  The heredity of stuttering |journal= Quarterly Journal of Speech |issue=1 |pages=23–30 |ref=harv |doi=10.1080/00335633909380434 |volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view is that a stutter (stammer) is a '''complex tic'''. This view is held for the following reasons. It always arises from repetition of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, the more they like this outlet for their tension – an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds he has a new baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3–4 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male [[Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis|Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis]] is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more [[cortisol]] than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.&lt;ref&gt;Stammering (Stuttering) A Complex Vocal Tic, Patricia Sims, Kindle version 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 article, three genes were found by [[Dennis Drayna]] and team to correlate with stuttering: [[GNPTAB]], [[GNPTG]], and [[NAGPA]]. Researchers estimated that alterations in these three genes were present in 9% of people who stutter who have a family history of stuttering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kang|first=Changsoo|last2=Riazuddin|first2=Sheikh|last3=Mundorff|first3=Jennifer|last4=Krasnewich|first4=Donna|last5=Friedman|first5=Penelope|last6=Mullikin|first6=James C.|last7=Drayna|first7=Dennis|date=2010-02-25|title=Mutations in the Lysosomal Enzyme–Targeting Pathway and Persistent Stuttering|url=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0902630|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=EN|volume=362|issue=8|pages=677–685|doi=10.1056/nejmoa0902630|issn=0028-4793|pmc=2936507|pmid=20147709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://children.webmd.com/news/20100210/genetic-mutations-linked-to-stuttering |title=Genetic Mutations Linked to Stuttering |publisher=Children.webmd.com |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112104541/http://children.webmd.com/news/20100210/genetic-mutations-linked-to-stuttering |archivedate=2012-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some people who stutter, congenital factors may play a role. These may include physical trauma at or around birth, learning disabilities, as well as [[cerebral palsy]]. In other people who stutter, there could be added impact due to stressful situations such as the birth of a sibling, moving, or a sudden growth in linguistic ability.&lt;ref name="Guitar5–6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guitar66"/&gt;

There is clear empirical evidence for structural and functional differences in the brains of people who stutter. Research is complicated somewhat by the possibility that such differences could be the consequences of stuttering rather than a cause, but recent research on older children confirms structural differences thereby giving strength to the argument that at least some of the differences are not a consequence of stuttering.&lt;ref name="watkins"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Watkins KE, Smith SM, Davis S, Howell P |title=Structural and functional abnormalities of the motor system in developmental stuttering |journal=Brain |volume=131 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=50–9 |date=January 2008  |pmid=17928317 |pmc=2492392 |doi=10.1093/brain/awm241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chang"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Soo-Eun, Chang|title= Brain anatomy differences in childhood stuttering |journal=[[NeuroImage (journal)|NeuroImage]] |year=2007 |ref= harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auditory processing deficits have also been proposed as a cause of stuttering. Stuttering is less prevalent in deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 46–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stuttering may be reduced when auditory feedback is altered, such as by [[Auditory masking|masking]], [[delayed auditory feedback]] (DAF), or frequency altered feedback.&lt;ref name="gordon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that the functional organization of the auditory cortex may be different in people who stutter.&lt;ref name="gordon"/&gt;

There is evidence of differences in linguistic processing between people who stutter and people who do not stutter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain scans of adult people who stutter have found increased activation of the right hemisphere, which is associated with emotions, than in the left hemisphere, which is associated with speech. In addition, reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed.&lt;ref name="gordon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guitar66"/&gt;

The ''capacities and demands'' model has been proposed to account for the heterogeneity of the disorder. In this approach, speech performance varies depending on the ''capacity'' that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the ''demands'' placed upon the person by the speaking situation. Capacity for fluent speech may be affected by a predisposition to the disorder, auditory processing or motor speech deficits, and [[Cognition|cognitive]] or [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] issues. Demands may be increased by internal factors such as lack of confidence or [[Self-esteem|self esteem]] or inadequate language skills or external factors such as [[peer pressure]], time pressure, stressful speaking situations, insistence on perfect speech, and the like. In stuttering, the severity of the disorder is seen as likely to increase when demands placed on the person's speech and language system exceed their capacity to deal with these pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the precise nature of the capacity or incapacity has not been delineated.

==Mechanism==

===Physiology===
Though neuroimaging studies have not yet found specific neural correlates, there is much evidence that the brains of adults who stutter differ from the brains of adults who do not stutter. Several neuroimaging studies have emerged to identify areas associated with stuttering.  In general, during stuttering, cerebral activities change dramatically in comparison to silent rest or fluent speech between people who stutter and people who do not stutter. There is evidence that people who stutter activate motor programs before the articulatory or linguistic processing is initiated. Brain imaging studies have primarily been focused on adults. However, the neurological abnormalities found in adults does not determine whether childhood stuttering caused these abnormalities or whether the abnormalities cause stuttering.&lt;ref name=watkins /&gt;

Studies utilizing [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) have found during tasks that invoke disfluent speech, people who stutter show [[hypoactivity]] in cortical areas associated with language processing, such as [[Broca's area]], but hyperactivity in areas associated with motor function.&lt;ref name="Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA." /&gt;  One such study that evaluated the stutter period found that there was over activation in the cerebrum and cerebellum, and relative deactivation of the left hemisphere auditory areas and frontal temporal regions.&lt;ref name="Bloodstein 1" /&gt;

[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) has found abnormal activation in the right frontal operculum (RFO), which is an area associated with time-estimation tasks, occasionally incorporated in complex speech.&lt;ref name="Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA." /&gt;

Researchers have explored temporal cortical activations by utilizing [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG).  In single-word-recognition tasks, people who do not stutter showed cortical activation first in [[:wikt:occipital|occipital]] areas, then in left inferior-frontal regions such as Broca’s area, and finally, in motor and premotor cortices.  The people who stutter also first had cortical activation in the occipital areas but the left inferior-frontal regions were activated only after the motor and premotor cortices were activated.&lt;ref name="Department of Psychology, and Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition, University of Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA." /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloodstein 1" /&gt;

During speech production, people who stutter show overactivity in the anterior insula, cerebellum and bilateral midbrain.  They show underactivity in the ventral premotor, Rolandic opercular and sensorimotor cortex bilaterally and Heschl’s gyrus in the left hemisphere.&lt;ref name=watkins/&gt;  Additionally, speech production in people who stutter yields underactivity in cortical motor and premotor areas.&lt;ref name=watkins /&gt;

===Abnormal lateralization===
Much evidence from neuroimaging techniques has supported the theory that the right hemisphere of people who stutter interferes with left-hemisphere speech production.

Adults who stutter have anatomical differences in gyri within the perisylvian frontotemporal areas. A large amount of white matter is found in the right hemisphere of the brain, including the region of the superior temporal gyrus. This was discovered using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). On the other hand, lesser amounts of white matter are found in the left inferior arcuate fasciculus connecting the temporal and frontal areas in stuttering adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang SE, Erickson KI, Ambrose NG, Hasegawa-Johnson MA, Ludlow CL |title=Brain anatomy differences in childhood stuttering |journal=NeuroImage |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=1333–44 |date=February 2008  |pmid=18023366 |pmc=2731627 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.09.067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Results have shown that there is less coordination between the speech motor and planning regions in the brain's left hemisphere of men and women who stutter, when compared to a non-stuttering control group.&lt;ref name="stutteringhelp.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stutteringhelp.org/brain-development-children-who-stutter |title=Brain Development in Children Who Stutter &amp;#124; Stuttering Foundation: A Nonprofit Organization Helping Those Who Stutter |publisher=Stutteringhelp.org |date=1955-12-04 |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512173904/http://www.stutteringhelp.org/brain-development-children-who-stutter |archivedate=2014-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomical connectivity of the speech motor and planning regions is less vigorous in adults who stutter, especially women. Men who stutter seem to have more right-sided motor connectivity. On the other hand, stuttering women have less connectivity with the right motor regions.&lt;ref name="stutteringhelp.org"/&gt;

In non-stuttering, normal speech, PET scans show that both hemispheres are active but that the left hemisphere may be more active. By contrast, people who stutter yield more activity on the right hemisphere, suggesting that it might be interfering with left-hemisphere speech production. Another comparison of scans anterior forebrain regions are disproportionately active in stuttering subjects, while post-rolandic regions are relatively inactive.&lt;ref name=Braun&gt;{{cite web|last=Braun|title=Altered patterns of cerebral activity during speech and language production in developmental stuttering. An H2(15)O positron emission tomography study.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bilateral increases and unusual right-left asymmetry has been found in the [[planum temporale]] when comparing people who stutter and people who do not stutter.&lt;ref name="Bloodstein 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bloodstein|first=Oliver|title=Handbook on Stuttering|work=p.142|publisher=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have also found that there are anatomical differences in the [[Rolandic operculum]] and [[arcuate fasciculus]].&lt;ref name="Carlson, N. 2013 pp. 497-500"/&gt;

===Other anatomical differences===
The corpus callosum transfers information between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The corpus callosum, rostrum, and the anterior mid-body sections are larger in adults who stutter as compared to normally fluent adults. This difference may be due to unusual functions of brain organization in stuttering adults and may be a result of how the stuttering adults performed language-relevant tasks. Furthermore, previous research has found that adults who stutter show cerebral hemispheres that contain uncommon brain proportions and allocations of gray and white matter tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McGaughey |first=Steve |url=http://www.futurity.org/health-medicine/stuttering-starts-in-the-brain/ |title=Stuttering starts in the brain |publisher=Futurity |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424125642/http://www.futurity.org/health-medicine/stuttering-starts-in-the-brain/ |archivedate=2013-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dopamine===
Recent studies have found that adults who stutter have elevated levels of the neurotransmitter [[dopamine]], and have thus found [[dopamine antagonist]]s that reduce stuttering (see anti-stuttering medication below).&lt;ref name="Bloodstein 1"/&gt; Overactivity of the midbrain has been found at the level of the substantia nigra extended to the red nucleus and subthalamic nucleus, which all contribute to the production of dopamine.&lt;ref name=watkins /&gt; However, increased dopamine does not imply increased excitatory function since dopamine's effect can be both excitatory or inhibitory depending upon which dopamine receptors (labelled D1 – D5) have been stimulated.

== Diagnosis ==
Some characteristics of stuttered speech are not as easy for listeners to detect. As a result, diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP). Diagnosis of stuttering employs information both from direct observation of the individual and information about the individual’s background, through a case history. Information from both sources should span multiple, various settings and times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stutteringhelp.org/differential-diagnosisThe Stuttering Foundation]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SLP may collect a case history on the individual through a detailed interview or conversation with the parents (if client is a child). They may also observe parent-child interactions and observe the speech patterns of the child's parents.&lt;ref name="cirrie.buffalo.edu"&gt;http://cirrie.buffalo.edu/encyclopedia/en/article/158/#s4International {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110190444/http://cirrie.buffalo.edu/encyclopedia/en/article/158/ |date=2013-11-10 }} Encyclopedia ofRehabilitation&lt;/ref&gt; The overall goal of assessment for the SLP will be (1) to determine whether a speech disfluency exists, and (2) assess if its severity warrants concern for further treatment.

During direct observation of the client, the SLP will observe various aspects of the individual’s speech behaviors. In particular, the therapist might test for factors including the types of disfluencies present (using a test such as the Dysfluency Type Index (DTI)), their frequency and duration (number of iterations, percentage of syllables stuttered (%SS)), and speaking rate (syllables per minute (SPM), words per minute (WPM)). They may also test for naturalness and fluency in speaking (naturalness rating scale (NAT), test of childhood stuttering (TOCS)) and physical concomitants during speech (''Riley’s Stuttering Severity Instrument Fourth Edition (SSI-4)'').&lt;ref name="cirrie.buffalo.edu"/&gt; They might also employ a test to evaluate the severity of the stuttering and predictions for its course. One such test includes the stuttering prediction instrument for young children (SPI), which analyzes the child’s case history, part-word repetitions and prolongations, and stuttering frequency in order to determine the severity of the disfluency and its prognosis for chronicity for the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cirrie.buffalo.edu/encyclopedia/en/article/158/#s4International Encyclopedia of Rehabilitation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110190444/http://cirrie.buffalo.edu/encyclopedia/en/article/158/ |date=2013-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuttering is a multifaceted, complex disorder that can impact an individual’s life in a variety of ways. Children and adults are monitored and evaluated for evidence of possible social, psychological or emotional signs of stress related to their disorder. Some common assessments of this type measure factors including: anxiety (Endler multidimensional anxiety scales (EMAS)), attitudes (personal report of communication apprehension (PRCA)), perceptions of self (stutterers’ self-rating of reactions to speech situations (SSRSS)), quality of life (overall assessment of the speaker’s experience of stuttering (OASES)), behaviors (older adult self-report (OASR)), and mental health (composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI)).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/health/downloads/star-stutteringresource.pdfLa Trobe University School of Human Communication Disorders]&lt;/ref&gt;

The SLP will then attempt to combine the information garnered from the client's case study along with the information acquired from the assessments in order to make a final decision regarding the existence of a fluency disorder and determine the best course of treatment for the client.

Stuttering can also diagnosed per the DSM-5 diagnostic codes&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; by clinical psychologists with adequate expertise.  The most recent version of the DSM-5 describes this speech disorder as "Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder (Stuttering)" for developmental stuttering, and "Adult-onset Fluency Disorder".  However, the specific rationale for this change from the DSM-IV is ill-documented in the APA's published literature, and is felt by some to promote confusion between the very different terms "fluency" and "disfluency".

===Classification===
Developmental stuttering is stuttering that originates when a child is learning to speak and develops as the child matures into adulthood.

Other disorders with symptoms resembling stuttering include [[autism]], [[cluttering]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[essential tremor]], [[palilalia]], [[spasmodic dysphonia]], [[selective mutism]], and [[social anxiety]].

====Developmental====
Stuttering is typically a [[developmental disorder]] beginning in early childhood and continuing into adulthood in at least 20% of affected children.&lt;ref name="gordon"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gordon, N. |title=Stuttering: incidence and causes |journal=Developmental Medicine &amp; Child Neurology |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=278–81 |year=2002 |pmid=11995897 |doi = 10.1017/S0012162201002067 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="craig2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1= Craig, A.|author2= Tran, Y.|title=The epidemiology of stuttering: The need for reliable estimates of prevalence and anxiety levels over the lifespan|journal= Advances in Speech–Language Pathology |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=41–46 |year=2005 |ref= harv |doi= 10.1080/14417040500055060}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean onset of stuttering is 30 months.&lt;ref name="fn 30"/&gt; Although there is variability, early stuttering behaviours usually consist of word or syllable repetitions, while secondary behaviours such as tension, avoidance or escape behaviours are absent.&lt;ref name="Ward13"&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most young children are unaware of the interruptions in their speech.&lt;ref name="Ward13"/&gt; With young stutterers, disfluency may be episodic, and periods of stuttering are followed by periods of relatively decreased disfluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp=114–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the rate of early recovery is very high,&lt;ref name="gordon"/&gt; with time a young person who stutters may transition from easy, relaxed repetition to more tense and effortful stuttering, including blocks and prolongations.&lt;ref name="Ward13"/&gt; Some propose that parental reactions may affect the development of a chronic stutter. Recommendations to "slow down", "take a breath", "say it again", etc., may increase the child’s anxiety and fear, leading to more difficulties with speaking and, in the "cycle of stuttering," to yet more fear, anxiety and expectation of stuttering.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 13, 115}}&lt;/ref&gt; With time secondary stuttering, including escape behaviours such as eye blinking and lip movements, may be used, as well as fear and avoidance of sounds, words, people, or speaking situations. Eventually, many become fully aware of their disorder and begin to identify themselves as stutterers. With this may come deeper frustration, embarrassment and shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other, rarer patterns of stuttering development have been described, including sudden onset with the child being unable to speak, despite attempts to do so.&lt;ref name="Ward 2006 pp= 117–119"&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The child usually is unable to utter the first sound of a sentence, and shows high levels of awareness and frustration. Another variety also begins suddenly with frequent word and phrase repetition, and does not include the development of secondary stuttering behaviours.&lt;ref name="Ward 2006 pp= 117–119"/&gt;

Stuttering can also have its roots in development. Many toddlers and preschool age children stutter as they are learning to talk, and although many parents worry about it, most of these children will outgrow the stuttering and will have normal speech as they get older. Since most of these children do not stutter as adults, this normal stage of speech development is usually referred to as pseudo-stuttering or as a normal disfluency. As children learn to talk, they may repeat certain sounds, stumble on or mispronounce words, hesitate between words, substitute sounds for each other, and be unable to express some sounds. Children with a normal disfluency usually have brief repetitions of certain sounds, syllables or short words, however, the stuttering usually comes and goes and is most noticeable when a child is excited, stressed or overly tired. Stuttering is also believed to be caused by neurophysiology. Neurogenic stuttering is a type of fluency disorder in which a person has difficulty in producing speech in a normal, smooth fashion. Individuals with fluency disorders may have speech that sounds fragmented or halting, with frequent interruptions and difficulty producing words without effort or struggle. Neurogenic stuttering typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system. Injuries to the brain and spinal cord, including cortex, subcortex, cerebellar, and even the neural pathway regions.&lt;ref name="Carlson, N. 2013 pp. 497-500"/&gt;

====Acquired stuttering====
In rare cases, stuttering may be acquired in adulthood as the result of a neurological event such as a head injury, tumour, stroke, or drug use. The stuttering has different characteristics from its developmental equivalent: it tends to be limited to part-word or sound repetitions, and is associated with a relative lack of anxiety and secondary stuttering behaviors. Techniques such as altered auditory feedback (see below), which may promote decreasing disfluency in people who stutter with the developmental condition, are not effective with the acquired type.&lt;ref name="gordon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="craig2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 4, 332–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychogenic stuttering may also arise after a traumatic experience such as a grief, the breakup of a relationship or as the psychological reaction to physical trauma. Its symptoms tend to be homogeneous: the stuttering is of sudden onset and associated with a significant event, it is constant and uninfluenced by different speaking situations, and there is little awareness or concern shown by the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 4, 332, 335–337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
{{main|Stuttering therapy}}
Before beginning treatment, an assessment is needed, as diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering/ |title=Stuttering |publisher=Asha.org |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131120151347/http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering/ |archivedate=2013-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
While there is no complete cure for stuttering, several treatment options exist that help individuals to better control their speech. Many of the available treatments focus on learning strategies to minimize stuttering through speed reduction, breathing regulation, and gradual progression from single-syllable responses to longer words, and eventually more complex sentences. Furthermore, some stuttering therapies help to address the anxiety that is often elicited as a result of stuttering, and consequently exacerbates stuttering symptoms.&lt;ref name="nidcd.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/pages/stutter.aspx#treated |title=Stuttering |publisher=Nidcd.nih.gov |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404214740/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/voice/Pages/stutter.aspx#treated |archivedate=2014-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method of treatment is referred to as a comprehensive approach, in which the main emphasis of treatment is directed toward improving the speaker's attitudes toward communication and minimizing the negative impact stuttering can have on the speaker's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf |title=Stuttering |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-05-12 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment from a qualified S-LP can benefit people who stutter of any age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf|title=ASHA – Treatment Efficacy for Stuttering|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043053/http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/public/TESStuttering.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speech language pathologists teach people who stutter to control and monitor the rate at which they speak. In addition, people may learn to start saying words in a slightly slower and less physically tense manner. They may also learn to control or monitor their breathing. When learning to control speech rate, people often begin by practising smooth, fluent speech at rates that are much slower than typical speech, using short phrases and sentences. Over time, people learn to produce smooth speech at faster rates, in longer sentences, and in more challenging situations until speech sounds both fluent and natural. When treating stuttering in children, some researchers recommend that an evaluation be conducted every three months in order to determine whether or not the selected treatment option is working effectively. "Follow-up" or "maintenance" sessions are often necessary after completion of formal intervention to prevent relapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering.htm |title=Stuttering |publisher=Asha.org |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016041011/http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/stuttering.htm |archivedate=2009-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluency shaping therapy===
Fluency shaping therapy, also known as "speak more fluently", "prolonged speech", or "connected speech", trains people who stutter to speak less disfluently by controlling their breathing, phonation, and articulation (lips, jaw, and tongue). It is based on [[operant conditioning]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who stutter are trained to reduce their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants, and using other disfluency-reducing techniques such as continuous airflow and soft speech contacts. The result is very slow, monotonic, but fluent speech, used only in the speech clinic. After the person who stutters masters these skills, the speaking rate and intonation are increased gradually. This more normal-sounding, fluent speech is then transferred to daily life outside the speech clinic, though lack of speech naturalness at the end of treatment remains a frequent criticism. Fluency shaping approaches are often taught in intensive group therapy programs, which may take two to three weeks to complete, but more recently the Camperdown program, using a much shorter schedule, has been shown to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|pp= 257–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modification therapy===
The goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to eliminate stuttering but to modify it so that stuttering is easier and less effortful.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 253}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale is that since fear and anxiety causes increased stuttering, using easier stuttering and with less fear and avoidance, stuttering will decrease. The most widely known approach was published by [[Charles Van Riper]] in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, depending on the patient, speech therapy may be ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuttering-stammering.com/ Stuttering, Stammering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910233428/http://www.stuttering-stammering.com/ |date=2012-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic fluency device===
{{main|Electronic fluency device}}
Altered auditory feedback, so that people who stutter hear their voice differently, has been used for over 50 years in the treatment of stuttering.&lt;ref name="bothe2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bothe, A.&amp;nbsp;K. |author2= Finn,&amp;nbsp;P.|author3=Bramlett, R.&amp;nbsp;E. |title=Pseudoscience and the SpeechEasy: Reply to Kalinowski, Saltuklaroglu, Stuart, and Guntupalli (2007)|journal= American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology |volume=16 |pages=77–83 |year=2007 |pmid=&lt;!--none--&gt;| doi = 10.1044/1058-0360(2007/010) |ref=harv}} &lt;!-- is the "author reply" in PMID 17329677 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Altered auditory feedback effect can be produced by speaking in chorus with another person, by blocking out the person who stutters' voice while talking (masking), by delaying slightly the voice of the person who stutters (delayed auditory feedback) or by altering the frequency of the feedback (frequency altered feedback). Studies of these techniques have had mixed results, with some people who stutter showing substantial reductions in stuttering, while others improved only slightly or not at all.&lt;ref name="bothe2007"/&gt; In a 2006 review of the efficacy of stuttering treatments, none of the studies on altered auditory feedback met the criteria for experimental quality, such as the presence of control groups.&lt;ref name="Bothe2006I"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bothe | first1=AK | last2=Davidow | first2=JH | last3=Bramlett | first3=RE | last4=Ingham | first4=RJ |title=Stuttering Treatment Research 1970–2005: I.

===Medications===
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any drug for the direct treatment of stuttering.&lt;ref name="nidcd.nih.gov"/&gt; However, the effectiveness of pharmacological agents, such as [[benzodiazepine]]s, [[anticonvulsant]]s, [[antidepressant]]s, [[antipsychotic]] and [[antihypertensive]] medications, and [[dopamine antagonist]]s in the treatment of stuttering has been evaluated in studies involving both adults and children.&lt;ref name="Bothe2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bothe, A.

A comprehensive review of pharmacological treatments of stuttering in 2006 concluded that few of the drug trials were methodologically sound.&lt;ref name="Bothe2006"/&gt; Of those that were, only one, not unflawed study,&lt;ref name="fn 12"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maguire GA, Riley GD, Franklin DL, Gottschalk LA |title=Risperidone for the treatment of stuttering |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=479–82 |date=April 1980|pmid=10917410 |doi=10.1097/00004714-200008000-00013}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed a reduction in the frequency of stuttering to less than 5% of words spoken. In addition, potentially serious [[side effect]]s of pharmacological treatments were noted,&lt;ref name="Bothe2006"/&gt; such as [[weight gain]], sexual dysfunctions and the potential for [[blood pressure]] increases. There is one new drug studied especially for stuttering named [[pagoclone]], which was found to be well-tolerated "with only minor side-effects of [[headache]] and fatigue reported in a minority of those treated".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stutteringhelp.org/default.aspx?tabindex=553&amp;tabid=566 New drugs for stuttering may be on the horizon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227095449/http://www.stutteringhelp.org/default.aspx?tabindex=553&amp;tabid=566 |date=2009-12-27 }} (Stuttering Foundation's summer 2007 newsletter.

===Support===
With existing behavioral, prosthetic, and pharmaceutical treatments providing limited relief from the overt symptoms of stuttering, support groups and the self-help movement continue to gain popularity and support by professionals and people who stutter. Self-help groups provide people who stutter a shared forum within which they can access resources and support from others facing the same challenges of stuttering.&lt;ref name="nidcd.nih.gov"/&gt; One of the basic tenets behind the self-help movement is that since a cure does not exist, quality of life can be improved by not thinking about the stammer for prolonged periods. Psychoanalysis has claimed success in the treatment of stuttering.&lt;ref name="Messer"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Integrating psychoanalytic and behaviour therapy: Limitations, possibilities and trade-offs |last=Messer |first=Stanley B. |date=June 1983 |journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=131–132 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8260.1983.tb00587.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypnotherapy has also been explored as a management alternative.&lt;ref name="McCord"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Hypnotherapy and stuttering |last=McCord |first=Hallack |pages=210–214 |journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis |volume=3 |issue=4 |year=1955 |doi=10.1080/00207145508410154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oakley"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207145508410154?journalCode=nhyp19#.UY7ahbW-mSo |title=Stuttering modification using hypnosis: A case study |last1=Oakley |first1=D. |last2=Moss |first2=G. |date=Spring 1996 |publisher=British Stammering Association |work=Speaking Out |doi=10.1080/00207145508410154 |volume=3 |pages=210–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://jshd.asha.org/cgi/content/citation/11/2/117 |title=Hypnosis in a system of therapy for stutterers |first=Wilbur E. |last=Moore |journal=Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders |volume=11 |pages=117–122 |date=June 1946 |issue=2 |doi=10.1044/jshd.1102.117 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110190400/http://jshd.asha.org/cgi/content/citation/11/2/117 |archivedate=2013-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Support groups further focus on the fact that stuttering is not a physical impediment but a psychological one.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/j24t0849x4p45338/ |title=Stuttering: A psychoanalytic view |last=Fisher |first=Martin N. |journal=Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy |volume=2 |number=2 |date=Winter 1970 |accessdate=13 August 2012 |pages=124–127 |doi=10.1007/bf02118180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological approach ===
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy|Cognitive behavior therapy]] has been used to treat stuttering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=R.P.|date=Spring 2017|title=Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Stuttering: A Case Series|pmc=3137813|journal=Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine|volume=2010 jan-jun 32(1)|pages=49–53|pmid=21799560|doi=10.4103/0253-7176.70533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also sociological approaches has been explored regarding how social groups maintain stuttering through social norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stutteringhabits.com/social-norms-and-stuttering-expectations/|title=Stuttering Habits|last=|first=|date=|website=Stuttering Habits|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418083207/http://stutteringhabits.com/social-norms-and-stuttering-expectations/|archive-date=2017-04-18|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diaphragmatic breathing===
Several treatment initiatives, for example the [[McGuire programme]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/tv/stammer-school-musharaf-finds-his-voice-channel-4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911012248/http://www.theartsdesk.com/tv/stammer-school-musharaf-finds-his-voice-channel-4 |archivedate=2014-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Starfish Project]] advocate [[diaphragmatic breathing]] (or ''costal breathing'') as a means by which stuttering can be controlled.

==Prognosis==
Among preschoolers, the [[prognosis]] for recovery is good. Based on research, about 65% of preschoolers who stutter recover spontaneously in the first two years of stuttering,&lt;ref name="fn 30"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yairi, E.|author2= Ambrose, N.|title=Onset of stuttering in preschool children: selected factors |journal=Journal of speech and hearing research |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=782–8 |year=1992 |pmid=1405533 |ref=harv |doi=10.1044/jshr.3504.782}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn 31"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yairi, E.|year=1993|title=Epidemiologic and other considerations in treatment efficacy research with preschool-age children who stutter|journal=Journal of Fluency Disorders|volume=18|pages=197–220|doi=10.1016/0094-730X(93)90007-Q|ref=harv|issue=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about 74% recover by their early teens.&lt;ref name="Ward16"&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2006|p= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, girls seem to recover well.&lt;ref name="Ward16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fn 34"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Yairi, E|title=On the Gender Factor in Stuttering|journal=Stuttering Foundation of America newsletter|date=Fall 2005|page= 5|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For others, early intervention is effective in helping the child overcome disfluency.&lt;ref name="Guitar7"&gt;{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once stuttering has become established, and the child has developed secondary behaviors, the prognosis is more guarded,&lt;ref name="Guitar7"/&gt; and only 18% of children who stutter after five years recover spontaneously.&lt;ref name="fn 32"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andrews, G. |author2=Craig, A. |author3=Feyer, A. M. |author4=Hoddinott, S. |author5=Howie, P. |author6=Neilson, M. |title=Stuttering: a review of research findings and theories circa 1982 |journal=The Journal of speech and hearing disorders |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=226–46 |year=1983 |pmid=6353066 |ref=harv |doi=10.1044/jshd.4803.226}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with treatment young children may be left with little evidence of stuttering.&lt;ref name="Guitar7"/&gt;

With adult people who stutter, there is no known cure,&lt;ref name="Ward16"/&gt; though they may make partial recovery or even complete recovery with intervention. People who stutter often learn to stutter less severely, though others may make no progress with therapy.&lt;ref name="Guitar7"/&gt;

Emotional sequelae associated with stuttering primarily relates to state-dependent anxiety related to the speech disorder itself.  However, this is typically isolated to social contexts that require speaking, is not a trait anxiety, and this anxiety does not persist if stuttering remits spontaneously.  Research attempting to correlate stuttering with generalized or state anxiety, personality profiles, trauma history, or decreased IQ have failed to find adequate empirical support for any of these claims.

==Epidemiology==
The lifetime [[prevalence]], or the proportion of individuals expected to stutter at one time in their lives, is about 5%,&lt;ref name="Mansson2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Mansson, H.|year=2000|title=Childhood stuttering: Incidence and development|journal=Journal of Fluency Disorders|volume=25|issue=1|pages=47–57|doi=10.1016/S0094-730X(99)00023-6|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and overall males are affected two to five times more often than females.&lt;ref name="craig2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yairi96"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Yairi, E |author2=Ambrose, N |author3=Cox, N|year=1996|title=Genetics of stuttering: a critical review|journal=Journal of Speech Language Hearing Research|volume= 39|pages=771–784|ref= harv|doi=10.1044/jshr.3904.771}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fn 28"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kloth, S |author2=Janssen, P |author3=Kraaimaat, F |author4=Brutten, G |year = 1995 |title = Speech-motor and linguistic skills of young people who stutter prior to onset |journal=Journal of Fluency Disorders |issue=2 |pages=157–70 | doi=10.1016/0094-730X(94)00022-L | volume = 20 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is not much information known about the underlying cause for such a skewed sex ratio.&lt;ref name="stutteringhelp.org"/&gt; Most stuttering begins in early childhood, and studies suggest that 2.5% of children under the age of 5 stutter.&lt;ref name="Proctor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yairi2005"/&gt; As seen in children who have just begun stuttering, there is an equivalent number of boys and girls who stutter. Still, the sex ratio appears to widen as children grow: among preschoolers, boys who stutter outnumber girls who stutter by about a two to one ratio, or less.&lt;ref name="fn 28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yairi2005"/&gt; This ratio widens to three to one during first grade, and five to one during fifth grade,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guitar|2005|p= 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as girls have higher recovery rates.&lt;ref name="Ward16"/&gt; Due to high (approximately 65–75%) rates of early recovery,&lt;ref name="Yairi96"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yairi99"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yairi, E. |author2=Ambrose, N.

Cross-cultural studies of stuttering prevalence were very active in early and mid-20th century, particularly under the influence of the works of [[Wendell Johnson]], who claimed that the onset of stuttering was connected to the cultural expectations and the pressure put on young children by anxious parents. Johnson claimed there were cultures where stuttering, and even the word "stutterer", were absent (for example, among some tribes of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]). Later studies found that this claim was not supported by the facts, so the influence of cultural factors in stuttering research declined. It is generally accepted by contemporary scholars that stuttering is present in every culture and in every race, although the attitude towards the actual prevalence differs. Some believe stuttering occurs in all cultures and races&lt;ref name="Guitar5–6"/&gt; at similar rates,&lt;ref name="craig2005"/&gt; about 1% of general population (and is about 5% among young children) all around the world. A US-based study indicated that there were no racial or ethnic differences in the incidence of stuttering in preschool children.&lt;ref name="Proctor"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Proctor, A. |author2=Duff, M. |author3=Yairi, E. |year=2002|title=Early childhood stuttering: African Americans and European Americans|journal=ASHA Leader|volume=4|issue=15|page=102|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yairi2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Yairi, E. |author2=Ambrose, N. |year=2005|title=Early childhood stuttering|location=[[Austin, Texas]]|journal=Pro-Ed|ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, there are cross-cultural studies indicating that the difference between cultures may exist. For example, summarizing prevalence studies, E. Cooper and C. Cooper conclude: "On the basis of the data currently available, it appears the prevalence of fluency disorders varies among the cultures of the world, with some indications that the prevalence of fluency disorders labeled as stuttering is higher among black populations than white or Asian populations" (Cooper &amp; Cooper, 1993:197). In his "Stuttering and its Treatment: Eleven lectures" Mark Onslow remarked that "one recent study with many participants (N=119,367)&lt;ref&gt;Boyle C.A., Boulet S., Schieve L.A., Cohen R.A., Blumberg S.J., Yeargin-Allsopp M., Visser S., Kogan M.D.|2011. Trends in the prevalence of developmental disabilities in US children, 1997–2008. Pediatrics 2011 Jun;127(6):1034–42&lt;/ref&gt; convincingly reported more stuttering among African Americans than other Americans. Why this could be the case is challenging to explain..."&lt;ref&gt;Mark Onslow, [https://sydney.edu.au/health-sciences/asrc/docs/eleven_lectures.pdf "Stuttering and its Treatment: Eleven lectures"], 2017, June, pg. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different regions of the world are researched very unevenly. The largest number of studies has been conducted in European countries and in North America, where the experts agree on the mean estimate to be about 1% of the general population (Bloodtein, 1995. A Handbook on Stuttering). African populations, particularly from West Africa, might have the highest stuttering prevalence in the world—reaching in some populations 5%, 6% and even over 9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Nwokah, E|year=1988|title=The imbalance of stuttering behavior in bilingual speakers|journal=Journal of Fluency Disorders|volume=13|pages=357–373|doi = 10.1016/0094-730X(88)90004-6|ref = harv|issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many regions of the world are not researched sufficiently, and for some major regions there are no prevalence studies at all (for example, in China). Some claim the reason for this might be a lower incidence in the general population in China.&lt;ref name="reese"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Sheree Reese, [[Joseph Jordania]]|title= Stuttering in the Chinese population in some Southeast Asian countries: A preliminary investigation on attitude and incidence|journal= "Stuttering Awareness Day"; Minnesota State University, Mankato|year= 2001|url= http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/isad4/papers/reese2.html|ref= harv|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606033525/http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/isad4/papers/reese2.html|archivedate= 2011-06-06|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Because of the unusual-sounding speech that is produced and the behaviors and attitudes that accompany a stutter, it has long been a subject of scientific interest and speculation as well as discrimination and ridicule. People who stutter can be traced back centuries to the likes of [[Demosthenes]], who tried to control his disfluency by speaking with pebbles in his mouth.&lt;ref name="brosch"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brosch, S |author2=Pirsig, W. |title=Stuttering in history and culture |journal=Int. J. Pediatr. Otorhinolaryngol. |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=81–7 |year=2001 |pmid=11378182 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-5876(01)00474-8 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Talmud]] interprets [[Bible]] passages to indicate [[Moses]] was also a person who stuttered, and that placing a burning coal in his mouth had caused him to be "slow and hesitant of speech" (Exodus 4, v.10).&lt;ref name="brosch"/&gt;

[[Galen]]'s humoral theories were influential in Europe in the Middle Ages for centuries afterward. In this theory, stuttering was attributed to imbalances of the [[four bodily humors]]—yellow bile, blood, black bile, and phlegm. [[Hieronymus Mercurialis]], writing in the sixteenth century, proposed methods to redress the imbalance including changes in diet, reduced libido (in men only), and [[vomiting|purging]]. Believing that fear aggravated stuttering, he suggested techniques to overcome this. Humoral manipulation continued to be a dominant treatment for stuttering until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="rieber"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rieber, RW |author2=Wollock, J |title=The historical roots of the theory and therapy of stuttering |journal=Journal of communication disorders |volume=10 |issue=1–2 |pages=3–24 |year=1977 |pmid=325028 | doi = 10.1016/0021-9924(77)90009-0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly due to a perceived lack of intelligence because of his stutter, the man who became the [[Roman emperor]] [[Claudius]] was initially shunned from the public eye and excluded from public office.&lt;ref name="brosch"/&gt;

In and around eighteenth and nineteenth century Europe, surgical interventions for stuttering were recommended, including cutting the tongue with scissors, removing a triangular wedge from the posterior tongue, and cutting nerves, or neck and lip muscles. Others recommended shortening the [[uvula]] or removing the [[tonsil]]s. All were abandoned due to the high danger of bleeding to death and their failure to stop stuttering. Less drastically, [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard]] placed a small forked golden plate under the tongue in order to support "weak" muscles.&lt;ref name="brosch"/&gt;

[[Image:Notker Balbulus 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Notker of St. Gall|Notker Balbulus]], from a medieval manuscript.]]
Italian [[pathologist]] [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni|Giovanni Morgagni]] attributed stuttering to deviations in the [[hyoid bone]], a conclusion he came to via [[autopsy]].&lt;ref name="rieber"/&gt; Blessed [[Notker of St. Gall]] (c. 840–912), called Balbulus ("The Stutterer") and described by his biographer as being "delicate of body but not of mind, stuttering of tongue but not of intellect, pushing boldly forward in things Divine," was invoked against stammering.

A famous Englishman who stammered was King [[George VI]]. George VI went through years of speech therapy, most successfully under Australian speech therapist [[Lionel Logue]], for his stammer. This is dealt with in the Academy Award-winning film ''[[The King's Speech]]'' (2010) in which [[Colin Firth]] plays George VI. The film is based on an original screenplay by [[David Seidler]] who also used to stutter as a child until age 16.

Another notable case was that of English Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]. Churchill claimed, perhaps not directly discussing himself, that "[s]ometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment has been of some assistance in securing the attention of the audience..."&lt;ref name="fn 10"&gt;{{cite web | title=Churchill: A Study in Oratory | publisher=The Churchill Centre | url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=814 | accessdate=2005-04-05 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419061110/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=814 | archivedate=2005-04-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, those who knew Churchill and [http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/sharp/Churchill.htm commented] on his stutter believed that it was or had been a significant problem for him. His secretary [[Phyllis Moir]] commented that "Winston Churchill was born and grew up with a stutter" in her 1941 book ''I was Winston Churchill's Private Secretary''. She also noted about one incident "It’s s s simply s s splendid" he stuttered, as he always did when excited." Louis J. Alber, who helped to arrange a lecture tour of the United States, wrote in Volume 55 of ''The American Mercury'' (1942) that "Churchill struggled to express his feelings but his stutter caught him in the throat and his face turned purple" and that "born with a stutter and a [[lisp]], both caused in large measure by a defect in his palate, Churchill was at first seriously hampered in his public speaking. It is characteristic of the man’s perseverance that, despite his staggering handicap, he made himself one of the greatest orators of our time."

For centuries "cures" such as consistently drinking water from a snail shell for the rest of one's life, "hitting a stutterer in the face when the weather is cloudy", strengthening the tongue as a muscle, and various [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]] were used.&lt;ref name="fn 6"&gt;{{cite web | author = Kuster, Judith Maginnis | title = Folk Myths About Stuttering | publisher = [[Minnesota State University, Mankato|Minnesota State University]] | date = 2005-04-01 | url = http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/Infostuttering/folkmyths.html | accessdate = 2005-04-03 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050419090029/http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/Infostuttering/folkmyths.html | archivedate = 2005-04-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the past people have subscribed to theories about the causes of stuttering which today are considered odd. Proposed causes of stuttering have included [[tickling]] an infant too much, eating improperly during [[breastfeeding]], allowing an infant to look in the mirror, cutting a child's hair before the child spoke his or her first words, having too small a tongue, or the "work of the devil".&lt;ref name="fn 6"/&gt;

Some people who stutter, who are part of the [[disability rights movement]], have begun to embrace their stuttering voices as an important part of their identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Did I Stutter?|url = http://didistutter.org/|website = Did I Stutter?|accessdate = 2015-10-05|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151006092633/http://www.didistutter.org/|archivedate = 2015-10-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How To Stutter More|url = http://stuttermore.tumblr.com/|website = stuttermore.tumblr.com|accessdate = 2015-10-05|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151029165325/http://stuttermore.tumblr.com/|archivedate = 2015-10-29|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015 the UK Ministry of Defence announced the launch of the Defence Stammering Network to support and champion the interests of British military personnel and MOD civil servants who stammer and to raise awareness of the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-stammering-network-launched |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825135116/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/defence-stammering-network-launched |archivedate=2015-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bilingual stuttering ===

==== Identification ====
Bilingualism is often referred to those who are capable of communication in more than one language since birth and throughout childhood. Considering that language and culture are relatively fluid factors in one's understanding and production of language, it makes sense that bilingualism can be an important feature that impacts speech fluency. There are several ways during which stuttering may be noticed in bilingual children including the following.
* The child is mixing vocabulary (code mixing) from both languages in one sentence. This is a normal process that helps the child increase his skills in the weaker language, but may trigger a temporary increase in disfluency.&lt;ref name="Stuttering and the Bilingual Child"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stutteringhelp.org/stuttering-and-bilingual-child|title=Stuttering and the Bilingual Child|website=Stuttering Foundation: A Nonprofit Organization Helping Those Who Stutter|access-date=2017-12-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926020934/http://www.stutteringhelp.org/stuttering-and-bilingual-child|archivedate=2017-09-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The child is having difficulty finding the correct word to express his/her ideas resulting in an increase in normal speech disfluency.&lt;ref name="Stuttering and the Bilingual Child"/&gt;
* The child is having difficulty using grammatically complex sentences in one or both languages as compared to other children of the same age.  Also, the child may make grammatical mistakes.  Developing proficiency in both languages may be gradual, so development may be uneven between the two languages.&lt;ref name="Stuttering and the Bilingual Child"/&gt;
* Adding a second or third language between the ages of three and five years of age may cause stuttering to increase (become more severe).  However, this may be the case only when: (1) the child's first language is not strong and/or the child is experiencing difficulties in her first language, (2) One language is used more than the other or, (3) the child resists speaking the additional language.
It should also be noted that stuttering may present differently depending on the languages the individual uses. For example, morphological and other linguistic differences between languages may make presentation of disfluency appear to be more or less of a problem depending on the individual case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aAbPBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA362&amp;lpg=PA362&amp;dq=bilingual+stuttering+wiki&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5b34cGTCWL&amp;sig=XkcT8Kn_8t9SmEKhgoVC_vw0n9w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQrtngoJDYAhUX_mMKHVvODlQQ6AEIVDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=bilingual%20stuttering%20wiki&amp;f=false|title=Multilingual Aspects of Fluency Disorders|last=Howell|first=Peter|last2=Borsel|first2=John Van|date=2011|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=9781847693587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Research ====
Much research is being conducted to look at the prevalence of stuttering in bilingual populations and the differences between languages. For instance, one study concluded that bilingual children who spoke English and another language had an increased risk of stuttering and a lower chance of recovery from stuttering than monolingual speakers and speakers who spoke solely a language other than English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=P|last2=Davis|first2=S|last3=Williams|first3=R|date=January 2009|title=The effects of bilingualism on stuttering during late childhood|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=94|issue=1|pages=42–46|doi=10.1136/adc.2007.134114|issn=0003-9888|pmc=2597689|pmid=18782846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, though methodologically weak, showed relatively indistinguishable percentages of monolingual and bilingual stutterers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Au-Yeung|first=James|last2=Howell|first2=Peter|last3=Davis|first3=Steve|last4=Charles|first4=Nicole|last5=Sackin|first5=Stevie|date=2000-09-01|title=UCL survey of bilingualism and stuttering|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255604350_UCL_survey_of_bilingualism_and_stuttering|journal=Journal of Fluency Disorders - J FLUENCY DISORD|volume=25|pages=246–246|doi=10.1016/S0094-730X(00)80321-6|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223215820/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255604350_UCL_survey_of_bilingualism_and_stuttering|archivedate=2017-12-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to so much conflicting data, the relationship between bilingualism and stuttering has been called enigmatic,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rachel Karniol|date=1992-10-01|title=Stuttering out of bilingualism|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/014272379201203604|journal=First Language|volume=12|issue=36|pages=255–283|doi=10.1177/014272379201203604|issn=0142-7237}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can demonstrate the intricacies of the topic and encourages more research to be conducted in order to sway the belief of impact the relationship between bilingualism and stuttering has.

=== Stuttering in popular culture ===
[[Jazz]] and [[Eurodance]] musician [[Scatman John]] wrote the song "[[Scatman (Ski Ba Bop Ba Dop Bop)]]" to help children who stutter overcome adversity. Born John Paul Larkin, Scatman spoke with a stutter himself and won the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's Annie Glenn Award for outstanding service to the stuttering community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/famous/kudos.html Awards and Recognition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205011444/http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/famous/kudos.html |date=2008-12-05 }}. Retrieved 2009-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiction character [[Arkwright (Open All Hours)|Arkwright]] from the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Open All Hours]]'' stammered and much of the series' humour revolved around this. Recurring character [[Reginald Barclay]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' television franchise and the [[Emperor Claudius]] from the ''[[I,&amp;nbsp;Claudius]]'' series by [[Robert Graves]] and acted by [[Derek Jacobi]] are portrayed as suffering from and overcoming their stuttering.

[[Looney Tunes]] character [[Porky Pig]] has a notable stutter, which features in one of the character's most well-known catchphrases ("Th-th-th-that's all, folks!"). The character's stuttering originated from the authentic stutter of the voice artist, [[Joe Dougherty]]. Dougherty's stutter caused recording sessions to take longer than otherwise necessary, causing [[Warner Bros.]] to replace Dougherty with [[Mel Blanc]], who provided Porky's voice for the rest of his life.

The cartoon ''[[T.U.F.F. Puppy]]'' presents the character Keswick as stuttering.

In the 1996 film [[Primal Fear (film)|''Primal Fear'']], [[Edward Norton]] plays Aaron, a shy altar boy with a stutter who is accused of murdering an influential bishop.

The 2015 Indian ([[Malayalam]]) film ''[[Su.. Su... Sudhi Vathmeekam]]'' starring [[Jayasurya]] had portrayed the life of a real life person who overcomes the challenges faced in life due to stammering.

The 2016 Russian film ''Sheep &amp; Wolves'' presents a wolf name Skinny with a stutter.

'''Vinayak Narahari "Vinoba" Bhave''' ({{audio|Vinoba bhave.ogg|pronunciation}}; 11 September 1895 – 15 November 1982) was an Indian advocate of [[nonviolence]] and human rights. Often called ''Acharya'' ([[Sanskrit]] for teacher), he is best known for the [[Bhoodan Movement]]. He is considered as a ''National Teacher of India'' and the spiritual successor of [[Mohandas Gandhi]].

==Early life and background==
Vinayaka Narahari Bhave was born on 11 September 1895 in a small village called Gagoji (present day Gagode Budruk) in [[Raigad district|Kolaba]] in the [[Konkan]] region of what is now [[Maharashtra]]. Vinayaka was the eldest son of Narahari Shambhu Rao and Rukmini Devi. The couple had five children; four sons named Vinayaka (affectionately called Vinya), Balakrishna, Shivaji and Dattatreya, and one daughter.  His father was a trained weaver with a rationalist modern outlook, and worked in [[Baroda]]. Vinayaka was brought up by his grandfather, Shamburao Bhave and was greatly influenced by his mother Rukmini Devi, a religious woman from [[Karnataka]]. Vinayaka was highly inspired after reading the [[Bhagavad Gita]], at a very young age.&lt;ref name=biography&gt;{{cite book|last1=K.S.|first1=Narayanaswamy|title=Acharya Vinoba Bhave – A biography (Immortal Lights series)|date=2000|publisher=Sapna Book House|location=Bangalore|isbn=9788128017506}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A report in the newspapers about Gandhi's speech at the newly founded [[Benaras Hindu University]] attracted Bhave's attention. In 1916, on his way to [[Mumbai]] (then [[Bombay]]) to appear for the [[intermediate examination]], Bhave threw his school and college certificates into a fire. Bhave took the decision after reading the piece of writing in the newspaper written by Mahatma Gandhi. 
He wrote a letter to Gandhi and after an exchange of letters, Gandhi advised Bhave to come for a personal meeting at [[Kochrab Ashram]] in [[Ahmedabad]]. Bhave met Gandhi on 7 June 1916 and subsequently abandoned his studies. Bhave participated with keen interest in the activities at Gandhi's [[ashram]], like teaching, studying, spinning and improving the life of the community. His involvement with Gandhi's constructive programmes related to [[Khadi]], village industries, new education ([[Nai Talim]]), sanitation and hygiene also kept on increasing.

Bhave went to [[Wardha]] on 8 April 1921 to take charge of the Ashram as desired by Gandhi. In 1923, he brought out ''Maharashtra Dharma'', a Marathi monthly which had his essays on the Upanishads. Later on, this monthly became a weekly and continued for three years. In 1925, he was sent by Gandhi to [[Vaikom]], Kerala to supervise the entry of the [[Harijans]] to the temple.

Bhave was arrested several times during the 1920s and 1930s and served a five-year jail sentence in the 1940s for leading non-violent resistance to [[British rule]]. The jails for Bhave had become the places of reading and writing. He wrote Ishavasyavritti and Sthitaprajna Darshan in jail. He also learnt four South Indian languages and created the script of Lok Nagari at [[Vellore]] jail. In the jails, he gave a series of talks on Bhagavad Gita in Marathi, to his fellow prisoners. Bhave participated in the nationwide civil disobedience periodically conducted against the British, and was imprisoned with other nationalists. Despite these many activities, he was not well known to the public. He gained national prominence when Gandhi chose him as the first participant in a new nonviolent campaign in 1940.
All were calling him in his short name, Vinoba.{{cn|date=September 2018}}
Bhave's younger brother Balkrishna was also a Gandhian. Gandhi entrusted him and [[Manibhai Desai]] to set up a nature therapy ashram at [[Urali Kanchan]] where Balkrishna spent all his life&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi M. Nature cure. Kumarappa B, editor.

==Career==

===Freedom struggle===
[[File:Vinobha Kutir 1.JPG|right|190px|thumb|''Vinoba Kutir'' at [[Sabarmati Ashram]]]]
He was associated with [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in the [[Indian independence movement]]. He stayed for some time at Gandhi's Sabarmati ashram in a cottage that was named after him, 'Vinoba Kutir'. There he gave a series of talks on the Gita, in his native language [[Marathi language|Marathi]], to his fellow prisoners.

These highly inspiring talks were later published as the book "Talks on the Gita", and it has been translated into many languages both in India and elsewhere. Bhave felt that the source of these talks was something from above and he believed that its influence will endure even if his other works were forgotten.

In 1940 he was chosen by Gandhi to be the first individual Satyagrahi (an individual standing up for Truth instead of a [[collective action]]) against the British rule.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhe, Peter. Gandhi. London: Phaidon Press Limited, 2001. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Gandhi envied and respected Bhave's celibacy, a vow he made in his adolescence, in fitting with his belief in the [[Brahmacharya]] principle. Bhave also participated in the [[Quit India Movement]].

===Religious and social work===
[[File:Gandhi and Vinoba.jpg|right|190px|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and Bhave]]
Bhave's religious outlook was very broad and it synthesised the truths of many religions. This can be seen in one of his hymns "Om Tat Sat" which contains symbols of many religions. His slogan "जय जगत्" (Jay Jagat) i.e. "victory to the world" finds reflection in his views about the world as a whole.

Bhave observed the life of the average Indian living in a village and tried to find solutions for the problems he faced with a firm spiritual foundation. This formed the core of his ''[[Sarvodaya Movement|Sarvodaya movement]]''. Another example of this is the [[Bhoodan]] (land gift) movement started at [[Bhoodhan Pochampally|Pochampally]] on 18 April 1951, after interacting with 80 Harijan families. He walked all across India asking people with land to consider him as one of their sons and so give him one sixth of their land which he then distributed to landless poor. [[Non-violence]] and compassion being a hallmark of his philosophy, he also campaigned against the slaughtering of cows.

Bhave said, "I have walked all over India for 13 years. In the backdrop of enduring perpetuity of my life's work, I have established 6 ashrams.

===Brahma Vidya Mandir===
The Brahma Vidya Mandir is one of the ashrams that Bhave created. It is a small community for women that was created in order for them to become self-sufficient and non-violent in a community. This group farms to get their own food, but uses Gandhi's beliefs about food production, which include [[sustainability]] and [[social justice]], as a guide. This community, like Gandhi and Bhave, has been influenced greatly by the ''Bhagavad-Gita'' and that is also used to determine their practices. The community perform prayers as a group every day, reciting from the [[Isha Upanishad]] at dawn, the [[Vishnu Sahasranama]] at mid-morning, and the ''Bhagavad-Gita'' in the evening. As of today, there are around 25 women who are members of the community and several men have also been allowed to join in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanford|first=A. Whitney|title=Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India|journal=Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture|date=3 April 2013|volume=7|issue=1|pages=65–87|doi=10.1558/jsrnc.v7i1.65|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.authenticate.library.duq.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=83796f4c-f7c4-414a-b689-b82a34818d4c%40sessionmgr115&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=119|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its founding in 1959, members of Brahma Vidya Mandir (BVM), an intentional community for women in Paunar, Maharashtra, have dealt with the struggle of translating Gandian values such as self-sufficiency, non-violence, and public-service into specific practices of food production and consumption. BVM's existence and the counter-narrative its residents practice demonstrate how one community debate the practicalities and tradeoffs in their application of self-sufficiency, non-violence, and radical democracy to their own social and geographic context. One narrative described by BVM and the farmers that work with them is that large-scale agriculture is inevitable, necessary, and the sole possibility of feeding the world. They reject the narrative that success in agriculture comes from expensive technology. BVM is a small community in India, therefore it does not hold much power in its beliefs and practices. However, India today proudly proclaims its large and growing middle class, and although many see Gandhi as a hero, some reject his views in favor of US-style-consumerism and look for an alternate route in agriculture with technological advancements. The existence of BVM provides a counter-narrative on enacting alternate agriculture practices and social practices that were believed by woman back in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanford|first1=Whitney|title=Gandhi's agrarian legacy: practicing food, justice, and I love Jawad  sustainability in India Gandhi's agrarian legacy: practicing food, justice, and sustainability in India| date=2013|issue=20140825|doi=10.1558/jsrnc.v7i1.65|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.authenticate.library.duq.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=22&amp;sid=287e258a-738f-4738-956c-e6e9a1d47b04%40sessionmgr4001&amp;hid=4209&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=rfh&amp;AN=ATLA0001941265|accessdate=2014-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary career===
Vinoba Bhave was a scholar, thinker, and writer who produced numerous books. He was a translator who made Sanskrit texts accessible to the common man. He was also an orator and linguist who had an excellent command of several languages (Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi, Urdu, English, Sanskrit). Bhave was an innovative social reformer. He called "Kannada" script the "Queen of World Scripts" (''Vishwa Lipigala Raani''){{cn|date=September 2018}} He wrote brief introductions to, and criticisms of, several religious and philosophical works like the [[Bhagavad Gita]], works of [[Adi Shankaracharya]], the [[Bible]] and the [[Quran]]. His criticism of Dnyaneshwar's poetry and works by other Marathi saints is quite brilliant and a testimony to the breadth of his intellect.

Bhave had translated the [[Bhagavad Gita]] into Marathi. He was deeply influenced by the Gita and attempted to imbibe its teachings into his life, often stating that "The Gita is my life's breath".&lt;ref&gt;Minor Robert(1986) Modern Indian Interpreters of the Bhagavad Gita. State University of NY press. {{ISBN|978-0-88706-298-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his works are:
* The essence of Quran
* The essence of Christian teachings
* Thoughts on education
* Swarajya Sastra

[[Vinoba Bhave University]], located in [[Hazaribagh district]] in the state of [[Jharkhand]], is named after him.

===Vinoba Bhave and Land Donation Movement===
On 18 April 1951,&lt;ref&gt;''www.mkgandhi.org''&lt;/ref&gt; Bhave started his land donation movement at Pochampally of nalgonda district [[Telangana]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Un-Gandhian Gandhi : The Life and Afterlife of Mahatma'' - By Claude Markovits&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bhoodan Movement]]. He took donated land from land owner Indians and gave it away to the poor and landless, for them to cultivate.  Then after 1954, he started to ask for donations of whole villages in a programme he called Gramdan. He got more than 1000 villages by way of donation. Out of these, he obtained 175 donated villages in Tamil Nadu alone. Noted Gandhian and atheist [[Lavanam]] was the interpreter for Bhave during his land reform movement in Andhra Pradesh and parts of Orissa&lt;ref name="Markshep.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markshep.com/nonviolence/GT_Vinoba.html |title=The King of Kindness: Vinoba Bhave and His Nonviolent Revolution |publisher=Markshep.com |date= |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
Bhave spent the later part of his life at his Brahma Vidya Mandir ashram in Paunar in Wardha district of Maharashtra. He died on 15 November 1982 after refusing food and medicine for a few days by accepting "Samadhi Maran" / "[[Sallekhana|Santhara]]" as described in [[Jainism]].{{cn|date=April 2017}} The then Prime Minister of India, [[Indira Gandhi]], who was visiting Moscow to attend the funeral of Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], cut short her visit to be at the Bhave's funeral.

==Criticism==
[[V.S. Naipaul]] has scathingly criticised Bhave in his collection of essays citing his lack of connection with rationality and excessive imitation of Gandhi. Even some of his admirers find fault with the extent of his devotion to Gandhi. Much more controversial was his support, ranging from covert to open, to Congress Party's government under Indira Gandhi, which was fast becoming unpopular. He controversially backed the [[Indian Emergency]] imposed by Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], calling it ''Anushasana Parva'' (''Time for Discipline'').Jayaprakash Narayan in his prison diary during the emergency sarcastically wrote about the meaning of Anushasan Parva&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dandavate|first1=Madhu|title=Jayaprakash Narayan : struggle with values : a centenary tribute|date=2002|publisher=Allied Publishers|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788177643411|pages=224-225|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=bzydyhfwNnoC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=vinoba+bhave+emergency+indira&amp;ots=ysEWIiqWI9&amp;sig=r9v2nFZ-M_E_3mx_7FqtrQ8TJJ0#v=onepage&amp;q=anushasan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress party opponents at that time had coined the derogatory term "Sarkari Sant (Government Saint)" to describe him. Noted Marathi writer [[Purushottam Laxman Deshpande]] publicly criticised him and mocked him by writing article titled as "Vanaroba" which is disambiguation of name "Vinoba" and literally means [[monkey]].
However, in his end days he was very much against Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as she had ordered a shootout of the Sant Samaj who had undertaken a [[gherao]] of Parliament against cow slaughter.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The criticism has been considered objectionable and unfounded later. By Anushasan Parva – Time for Discipline – he meant everyone to follow the rule including the rulers of that time. At a later stage he called Intelligentsia to chart a path for the ruling community and public in general. During anushasn Parva – the king has to take the permission of the great men of his time – by that he meant to put the government under the guidance of the learned.{{Citation needed|reason=your explanation here|date=April 2014}} The identified persons included Late Shrimannarayan – former Governor of Gujarat and a great Gandhian of his time. They had suggested lifting of emergency. Yet the erstwhile government did not pay heed to the advice which had Vinoba Bhave's blessings and initiative.

==Awards==
In 1958 Bhave was the first recipient of the international [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for Community Leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographyBhaveVin.htm Online biography of Vinoba Bhave] accessed in January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Bharat Ratna]] posthumously in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india.gov.in/myindia/bharatratna_awards_list1.php?start=20 List of Bharat Ratna Awardees recipients] accessed in January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
