The '''Auberge d'Aragon''' ({{lang-mt|Berġa ta' Aragona}}) is an auberge in [[Birgu]], [[Malta]]. It was built in the 16th century to house knights of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of Saint John]] from the [[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)|langue]] of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]].

The auberge was located within Birgu's ''collachio'', adjacent to [[Auberge d'Auvergne et Provence]] and [[Auberge de France, Birgu|Auberge de France]].&lt;ref name="nicpmi"/&gt; The building is two stories high, and it has a central doorway and two balconies. The building housed the Langue of Aragon until a larger [[Auberge d'Aragon]] was built in [[Valletta]] sometime after 1571.&lt;ref name="vittoriosahistorica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zahra|first1=Lorenzo A.|title=The Spanish Langues and Auberges of the Order in Birgu|url=http://www.vittoriosahistorica.org/Leaflets/Auberge-de-Castille-Leon-et-Portugal.pdf|website=Vittoriosa Historical &amp; Cultural Society|publisher=Veritas Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704164025/http://www.vittoriosahistorica.org/Leaflets/Auberge-de-Castille-Leon-et-Portugal.pdf|archivedate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the façade is now covered with stone slabs, but the auberge still retains its original character. The building is now privately owned.&lt;ref name="vittoriosahistorica"/&gt;

The building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925, together with the other auberges in Birgu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of Antiquities Regulations 21st November, 1932 Government Notice 402 of 1932, as Amended by Government Notices 127 of 1935 and 338 of 1939. |url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627 |website=[[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6guMwmZDW?url=https://www.mepa.org.mt/file.aspx?f=2627 |archivedate=20 April 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument on 22 December 2009,&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Auberge D'Aragon|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20121122/environment/Auberge-D-Aragon.446372|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=22 November 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423154806/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20121122/environment/Auberge-D-Aragon.446372|archivedate=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is also listed on the [[National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands]].&lt;ref name="nicpmi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Auberge d' Aragon|url=http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01161.pdf|website=National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands|date=28 December 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208080710/http://www.culturalheritage.gov.mt/filebank/inventory/01161.pdf|archivedate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page gives Polish [[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN|PWN Encyklopedia]] as reference.&lt;/ref&gt; (sources vary). It starts from the triple junction of the borders with Lithuania in the north and stretches to the triple junction borders with Ukraine to the south. It is also part of the [[Countries bordering the European Union|EU border with Belarus]].

==History==
After Soviet [[Invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, the area of [[West Belarus]] [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|was annexed]] into the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. Five new Voblasts were created: Baranavichy, Belostok, Brest, Pinsk and Vialejka. In accordance with the [[Polish–Soviet border agreement of August 1945|Border Agreement between Poland and the USSR of 16 August 1945]] 17 districts of [[Belastok Voblast]] of the BSSR including the city of [[Białystok]] and 3 districts of [[Brest Voblast]], where a significant number of Poles lived, were transferred to Poland.

In 1946, during the refinement of the state border between the USSR and Poland, the villages of [[Klimówka]], [[Minkowce]], [[Nomiki]], [[Taki, Poland|Taki]], [[Tołcze]], [[Szymaki]] of the [[Hrodna District]] and the villages of [[Todorkowce]] and [[Chworosciany]] of the [[Sapotskin district]] were transferred to the Polish People's Republic. Thereafter, and until now the border between Poland and Belarus has never changed.

Border rivers (from north to south) are [[Czarna Hańcza]], [[Wolkuszanka]], [[Swislocz]], [[Narew]] and [[Western Bug]].

'''Bigeh''' ({{lang-ar|بجح}}; Ancient Egyptian ''znmwt''&lt;ref&gt;Allen, James P. ''Middle Egyptian Literature'' 2014, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;) is an island and archaeological site situated along the [[Nile|Nile River]] in historic [[Nubia]], and within the [[Aswan Governorate]] of southern [[Egypt]].  The island has been situated in the reservoir of the [[Old Aswan Dam]], since the dam's initial completion in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidney Peel]],[https://archive.org/details/bindingofnilene00peel The Binding of the Nile and the New Soudan], p.76 (1904)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canay Ozden, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00033790.2013.808378#.UgMgFW3pwTk The Pontifex Minimus: William Willcocks and Engineering British Colonialism], p. 196, [[Annals of Science]], 2013. DOI: 
10.1080/00033790.2013.808378&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Egypt==
It was formerly an island in the [[Cataracts of the Nile|First Cataract]] of the [[Nile River]], and its fortification controlled the access to ancient [[Upper Egypt]] and Nubia.  It is a [[World Heritage Site]], located close to [[Philae]] and [[Agilkia Island]]s and their ancient [[archaeological site]]s in the reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;''Yale University Publications in Anthropology'', Yale University 1936, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

Bigeh island was sacred to the [[ancient Egypt]]ians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120419073619/http://www.philae.nu/akhet/Philaebigeh.html The Island of Bigeh], www.philae.nu, date unknown, (accessed 17 February 2014 from archive.org)&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that [[Osiris]] was buried on the island,&lt;ref&gt;Burton, Anne (1972). ''Diodorus Siculus''. Brill. p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; and a temple that stood on it was known as ''Abaton'', Greek for "untrodden place", because only priests were allowed to set foot there.&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, Jitse H. F. (2008). ''Philae and the End of Ancient Egyptian Religion''. Peeters. p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was mentioned by both [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Q. N.'' iv. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucan, x.323&lt;/ref&gt;

The god [[Thoth]] bore the epithets of "Great and Splendid God in Bigeh" and "He that Pacifies the ''Nsr.t'' in Bigeh".&lt;ref&gt;Boylan, Patrick (1922). ''Thoth, Or the Hermes of Egypt''. p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that there may have been a temple of Thoth on the island.

The '''Black Lions''' were a [[anti-fascist]] [[resistance movement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bahru |last=Zewde |title=A History of Modern Ethiopia 1855-1991 |publisher=Addis Ababa University Press |year=2001|location=Addis Ababa |isbn= 0-8214-1440-2 |pages=168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; formed to fight against [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] during the [[Italian East Africa|occupation]] of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] in the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Shinn, David Hamilton &amp; Ofcansky, Thomas P. &amp; Prouty, Chris |title=Historical Dictionary of Ethiopia |publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=2004|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn= 0-8108-4910-0 |pages=75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book| authors=Selassie, Haile I &amp; Marcus, Harold (Editor) &amp; Gebions, Ezekiel (Translator)| title=My Life and Ethiopia's Progress: The Autobiography of Emperor Haile Selassie I, King of Kings and Lord of Lords|volume= II | publisher=Research Associates School Times Publications | year=1999 |location=Chicago |isbn= 0-948390-40-9 |pages=80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bahru Zewde notes, in spite of its "marginal impact on the Resistance" the Black Lions made "eloquent attempts to give the struggle coherent ideological and political direction."&lt;ref&gt;Bahru Zewde, ''A History of Modern Ethiopia'', second edition (Oxford: James Currey, 2001), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The movement was founded in western Ethiopia, and included fighters such as the [[Shewa|Shoan]] ''[[Ras (title)|Ras]]'' [[Abebe Aregai]],{{fact|date=January 2011}} and a number of intellectuals who included the sons of Hakim [[Workneh Eshete]] and [[Heruy Welde Sellase]], and [[Yilma Deressa]].&lt;ref&gt;Bahru Zewde, ''Pioneers of Change in Ethiopia'' (Oxford: James Currey, 2002), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Its chairman was [[Alemework Beyene]], a veterinary surgeon educated in Britain. The organization had a constitution consisting of ten points, which included: asserting the supremacy of the political sphere over the military, injunctions against mistreating peasants and prisoners of war, forbidding its members from seeking exile and urging them to prefer death to capture by the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Bahru Zewde, ''A History'', p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was effectively disbanded following the surrender of the ''Ras'' [[Imru Haile Selassie]] 18 December 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Mockler, ''Haile Selassie's War'' (New York: Olive Branch, 2003), pp. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of its members were killed by the Italians following the unsuccessful attempt on [[Rodolfo Graziani]]'s life on [[Yekatit 12|19 February 1937]].&lt;ref&gt;Bahru Zewde, ''Pioneers'', p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; The few survivors included Alemework and Yilma.

==Details==
The Black Lions dominated the early resistance movement in Ethiopia.  Members of the Black Lions included students from the [[Oletta Military Academy]] and foreign-educated Ethiopians.  The military academy was founded in 1935 and is located in [[Holeta Genet]].

The Black Lions convinced ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles|Ras]]''{{#tag:ref|Roughly equivalent to [[Duke]].|group=nb}} [[Imru Haile Selassie]] to join them in the armed struggle since he was part of the dynamics that created the movement.  ''Ras'' Imru was appointed by [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Haile Selassie]] as [[Prince Regent]] in his absence.  ''Ras'' Imru was to reorganize and continue to resist the Italians.  To do this, he fell back to [[Gore, Ethiopia|Gore]] in southern Ethiopia.  On 19 December 1936, after the Italians pinned him down on the north bank of the [[Gojeb River]], ''Ras'' Imru surrendered.  The Black Lions organization then collapsed, and many of its members were liquidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Shinn, David Hamilton &amp; Ofcansky, Thomas P. &amp; Prouty, Chris |date=2004|title= Historical Dictionary of Ethiopia|location= Lanham, Maryland|publisher= Scarecrow Press|page=75|isbn=0-8108-4910-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bombing of [[Alicante, Spain|Alicante]] was an aerial attack against the Spanish city of Alicante on 25 May 1938. It was one of the deadliest aerial bombings of the [[Spanish Civil War]].

==Background.==
After the [[Aragon Offensive]], [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] wanted to eliminate the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] maritime commerce and destroy the Republican morale and he authorized the ''[[Aviazione Legionaria]]'' and the ''[[Legion Condor]]'' to undertake indiscriminate bombings of the Republican cities. Valencia, [[Bombing of Barcelona|Barcelona]], Alicante, [[Bombing of Granollers|Granollers]] and other Spanish town and cities were bombed.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''Franco.'' Fontana Press. 1995. London. p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

==The bombing.==
On 25 May 1938, between seven and nine Italian [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79|SM.79]] and [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81|SM.81]] bombers of the ''[[Aviazione Legionaria]]'' bombed Alicante. The anti-aircraft artillery of the city was obsolete and the air-alarm system of the city didn’t work. The bombers dropped ninety bombs and many of them fell in the central market of the city. There were between 275 and 393 civilian deaths (100 men, 56 women, 10 children and more than 100 unidentified bodies), and 1000 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Bombardeo del mercado central de Alicante]]&lt;/ref&gt; Preston said that there were several hundreds of civilians killed.

==Aftermath==
The bombings of Alicante and Granollers, and the attacks against British shipping provoked protests in London.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''Franco.'' Fontana Press. 1995. London. p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

The name, among other meanings, is a one-letter deformation of "Pulă", a Romanian vulgar slang for "[[penis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Volkan, V. D. (1995). "[http://www.austenriggs.org/uploads/listWidget/1807/Totem%20and%20Taboo%20in%20Romania.pdf Totem and taboo in Romania: A psychopolitical diagnosis.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043138/http://www.austenriggs.org/uploads/listWidget/1807/Totem%20and%20Taboo%20in%20Romania.pdf |date=September 30, 2007 }}" ''Mind and Human Interaction'', 2: 66-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[Romanian Television]] conducted a vote to determine whom the general public considers the [[100 greatest Romanians]] of all time. Bulă was voted to be the 59th greatest Romanian (compare with [[Suuret suomalaiset#Humoristic voting and speculation on manipulated results|humoristic voting for 100 greatest Finns]]).

[[Silvian Cenţiu]], commenting on his show, ''A Transylvanian in Silicon Valley'', wrote: "When in [[San Francisco]] and in [[New York City|New York]] I mentioned Bula, the omnipresent character in Romanian jokes, I was delighted to hear audience members laugh before I finished the joke – I knew they were Romanians."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atransylvanian.com/play.htm "A Transylvanian in Silicon Valley"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carnival of Las Palmas''' (also Carnival of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria) is one of the most famous Carnivals in [[Spain]]. The event is held each February and hosted by [[Las Palmas]] de Gran Canaria. Events include the Queen Gala and Draq Queen Gala. The main parade, or "[[Cabalgata]]", is viewed by 200,000 people every year along with its six kilometer route across the city.

The Carnival of Las Palmas has been involved in controversial times. Among them is the controversy by joining the Carnival of Las Palmas of the act of "''Los Indianos''" belonging to the Carnival of [[Santa Cruz de La Palma]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://eldia.es/palma/2005-12-22/0-Acuerdo-Indianos-figuren-Carnaval-canarion.htm#4 Acuerdo para que Los Indianos no figuren en el Carnaval canarión]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bienmesabe.org/noticia/2006/Marzo/los-otros-indianos-la-polemica Los otros Indianos. La polémica.]&lt;/ref&gt; or joining the Carnival of Las Palmas of so-called "''Carnaval de Día''" which belongs to [[Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and to use the same model of retransmission of [[Tenerife]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldia.es/blogs/lacabalgata/?p=3002 Las Palmas copia el modelo de retransmisión de Tenerife]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conocchie''' (Italian plural of ''conocchia''-- a [[distaff]]) is a percussion instrument used in the folk music of much of southern [[Italy]]. Technically, the instrument is a [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]] and was originally crafted from a shepherd's staff or a distaff used in the craft of spinning. The staff has a permanently attached compartment on the top containing seed rattles. The instrument had ritual fertility significance. Today, such instruments come in many different shapes, all variations of the wooden staff and may be very ornately carved or crafted. It has been used commonly through history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3331">The '''Coudenberg group''' ({{lang-nl|Coudenberggroep}}, {{lang-fr|Groupe Coudenberg}}) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[federalist]] [[think-tank]], it was named after the place where the members met, the [[Coudenberg]], one of the seven hillocks on which the centre of [[Brussels]] has been built. President of the organization was the [[lawyer]] [[Jean-Pierre De Bandt]].

==Organisation==
The Coudenberg group was established on 6 June 1984 as a [[non-profit]] organization and was dissolved on 11 February 1999. The think-tank united leading people from the [[university]], [[Public administration|administration]], [[wikt:venture|venture]]s, [[trade union]]s and the [[profession|free profession]]s.
The Coudenberg group presented itself as an ''independent think-tank which unites, on the basis of a linguistic and ideological [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], people who understand that Belgium is itself on a cross point and who want to contribute to the political renewal of this country''. The Coudenberg group thought about issues concerning the organization of [[federation|federal]] Belgium and published several studies about this topic. Its goal was to defend the federal state against the demands of [[Flemish Movement|Flemish nationalists]].

==Members==
Among the approximately 70 members were people such as [[Antoine Bekaert]], [[André Belmans]], [[Philippe Bodson]], [[Bart De Schutter]], [[Jacques De Staercke]], [[Hubert Detremmerie]], [[Mark Dubrulle]], [[Jan Huyghebaert]], [[Koen Lenaerts]], [[Jacques Moulaert]], [[Sylvain Plasschaert]], [[Carlos Van Rafelghem]], [[Paul Van Remoortere]], [[Els Witte]], [[Kris Deschouwer]], [[Mieke Offeciers]]-Vandewiele, [[Patrick van Ypersele de Strihou]] (family of [[Jacques van Ypersele de Strihou]]).

'''DCF77''' is a German [[longwave]] [[time signal]] and standard-[[frequency]] radio station. It started service as a standard-frequency station on 1 January 1959. In June 1973 date and time information was added. Its primary and backup [[transmitter]] are located at {{coord|50|0|56|N|9|00|39|E}} in [[Mainflingen]], about 25&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]]. The transmitter generates a nominal power of 50&amp;nbsp;kW, of which about 30 to 35&amp;nbsp;kW can be radiated via a [[T-antenna]].

DCF77 is controlled by the ''[[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt]]'' (PTB), Germany's national [[physics]] laboratory and transmits in continuous operation (24 hours). It is operated by ''Media Broadcast GmbH'' (previously a subsidiary of ''[[Deutsche Telekom AG]]''), on behalf of the PTB. With Media Broadcast GmbH, a temporal transmission availability of at least 99.7% per year or under 26.28 hours of annual downtime has been agreed upon. Most service interruptions are short-term disconnections of under two minutes. Longer lasting transmission service interruptions are generally caused by strong winds, freezing rain or snow induced T-antenna movement. This manifests itself in electrical detuning of the antenna resonance circuit and hence a measurable [[phase modulation]] of the received signal. When the maladjustment is too large, the transmitter is taken out of service temporarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ptb.de/cms/en/fachabteilungen/abt4/fb-44/ag-442/dissemination-of-legal-time/dcf77/dcf77-receiver-authorization-and-availability.html |title=DCF77 Receiver authorization and availability |publisher=Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) |date=2014-02-03 |accessdate=2014-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 2002, almost 99.95% availability, or just over 4.38 hours of downtime, was realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://idw-online.de/pages/de/news59790%20 |title=Das abwechslungsreichste Radioprogramm der Welt |publisher=Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) |date=2003-02-21 |accessdate=2013-10-02 |language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The timestamp sent is either in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC)+1 or [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]+2 depending on [[daylight saving time]].&lt;!-- Link twice for esthetic reason --&gt;&lt;ref name="eecis_dcf77"&gt;{{cite web|title=Time and Standard Frequency Station DCF77 (Germany)|url=http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/dcf77.html}} 100503 eecis.udel.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The highly accurate 77.5&amp;nbsp;kHz (approximately {{val|{{#expr:299792458/77500 round 1}}|u=m}} wavelength) [[carrier signal]] is generated from local [[atomic clock]]s that are linked with the German master clocks at the PTB in [[Braunschweig]]. The DCF77 time signal is used for the dissemination of the [[Time in Germany|German national legal time]] to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ptb.de/cms/en/fachabteilungen/abt4/fb-44/ag-441/realisation-of-legal-time-in-germany.html |title=Realisation of Legal Time in Germany |publisher=Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) |date=2013-08-08 |accessdate=2013-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radio clock]]s and [[Watch#Movement|watch]]es have been very popular in Europe since the late 1980s and, in mainland Europe, most of them use the DCF77 signal to set their time automatically. Further industrial time-keeping systems at railway stations, in the field of telecommunication and information technology, at radio and TV stations are radio-controlled by DCF77 as well as tariff change-over clocks of energy supply companies and clocks in traffic-light facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ptb.de/cms/en/fachabteilungen/abt4/fb-44/ag-442/dissemination-of-legal-time/dcf77/benefit-of-dcf77.html |title=Benefit of DCF77 |publisher=Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) |date=2010-03-12 |accessdate=2014-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time signal===
The DCF77 station signal carries an amplitude-modulated, pulse-width coded 1 bit/s data signal. The same data signal is also [[phase modulated]] onto the [[carrier wave|carrier]] using a 512 bit long [[pseudorandom sequence]] ([[direct-sequence spread spectrum]] modulation). The transmitted data signal is repeated every minute.
* Current date and time bits;
* [[Leap second]] warning bit;
* Imminent change of CET to CEST, or vice versa, Announcement bit;
* [[Central European Time|Central European Time (CET)]] / [[European Summer Time|Central European Summer Time (CEST)]] bit;
* Abnormal transmitter operation identification bit;
* Several [[parity bit]]s.

===Experimental civil defence emergency signal===
Since 2003, 14 previously unused bits of the time code have been used for [[civil defence]] emergency signals. This is an experimental service, aimed to one day replace the German network of [[civil defence siren]]s.

===Civil protection and weather forecast signal===
Since 22 November 2006 the DCF77 transmitter uses bits 1–14 to transmit warning messages and weather information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbk.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html |title=BBK homepage |publisher=German Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance (BBK) |date=2013-03-09 |accessdate=2013-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ptb.de"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ptb.de/de/aktuelles/archiv/presseinfos/pi2006/pitext/pi061212.htm |title=DCF77 fit für die Zukunft.

As a further extension of the information content transmitted by DCF77, appropriately equipped [[radio clock]]s can provide a four-day [[weather forecast]] for 60 different regions in Europe. The forecast data is provided by and under responsibility of the Swiss company Meteo Time GmbH and is transferred in a proprietary transfer protocol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fact4ward.com/blog/meteotime/ Meteotime] A blog post describing decoding the weather information with an [[Arduino]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Wetterdatenbeschreibung des Systems Meteotime |author=Meteo Time GmbH |date=2006-10-27 |url=http://www.hkw-elektronik.de/pdf/DB%20W-Protokoll-V%201.pdf |language=German |trans-title=Weather data description of the Meteotime System |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229063350/http://www.hkw-elektronik.de/pdf/DB%20W-Protokoll-V%201.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same 14 bits are employed in a  way that ensures compatibility with the transmission protocols of the warning messages. For decoding the weather forecast data a license is required.&lt;ref name="ptb.de"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meteotime.com/Web/en/Home/Default.htm |title=Welcome at Meteotime.com |publisher=Meteo Time GmbH |date=2013-03-09 |accessdate=2013-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the bits previously reserved for the PTB are used, older radio clocks should not be affected by the weather data signal.

===Future and call sign===
The signal distribution contract between the PTB and the DCF77 transmitter operator Media Broadcast GmbH is periodically renewed. After negotiations in 2013 the PTB and Media Broadcast GmbH agreed to continue the dissemination of the German national legal time for the next 8 years. The PTB expressed it will initialize new negotiations if modernization activities at the transmitting station to improve the signal reception reliability throughout Europe by increasing the transmission power before 2021 are deemed necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ptb.de/cms/en/fachabteilungen/abt4/archiv-der-jahresberichte/jahresbericht080/news-from-the-annual-report.html?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=2438&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=1596&amp;cHash=100706a73ecc88778bfba992657e3b7f |title=Zeitaussendung mit DCF77 bis 2021 gesichert |publisher=Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) |date=2013-10-17 |accessdate=2014-01-16 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119063618/http://www.ptb.de/cms/en/fachabteilungen/abt4/archiv-der-jahresberichte/jahresbericht080/news-from-the-annual-report.html?tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=2438&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=1596&amp;cHash=100706a73ecc88778bfba992657e3b7f |archivedate=2014-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[call sign]] DCF77 stands for D = ''Deutschland'' (Germany), C = long wave signal, F = the longwave transmitters on the premises of the transmitting station Mainflingen (due to its vicinity to Frankfurt am Main), 77 = frequency: 77.5&amp;nbsp;kHz.

== Time code details ==
Like most [[longwave]] time transmitters (akin to the 162&amp;nbsp;kHz 2&amp;nbsp;MW [[TDF time signal]] broadcast from France), DCF77 marks seconds by reducing carrier power for an interval beginning on the second. The duration of the reduction is varied to convey one bit of time code per second, repeating every minute. The carrier is synchronized so the rising zero-crossing occurs on the second. All modulation changes also occur at rising zero-crossings.

=== Amplitude modulation ===
[[File:DCF77 code.svg|thumb|Amplitude modulated signal of DCF77 as a function of time]]

The DCF77 signal uses [[amplitude-shift keying]] to transmit digitally coded time information by reducing the amplitude of the carrier to 15% of normal (−16½&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]]) for 0.1 or 0.2 seconds at the beginning of each second. A 0.1 second reduction (7750 cycles of the 77500&amp;nbsp;Hz carrier amplitude) denotes a binary 0; a 0.2 second reduction denotes a binary 1. As a special case, the last second of every minute is marked with no carrier power reduction.

There was also a [[Morse code]] station identification until 2006, sent during minutes 19, 39 and 59 of each hour, however this was discontinued as the station is easily identifiable by the characteristic signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.ptb.de/cms/fileadmin/internet/fachabteilungen/abteilung_4/4.4_zeit_und_frequenz/4.42/dcf77.pdf |title=Zeit- und Normalfrequenzverbreitung mit DCF77 |page=6 |language=german |publisher=[[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt]] |accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 250&amp;nbsp;Hz tone was generated by [[square wave]] modulating the carrier between 100% and 85% power, and that tone was used to send one letter per second, between the second marks. During seconds 20–32, the call sign "DCF77" was transmitted twice.

=== Phase modulation ===
In addition, for 793 ms beginning at 200 ms, each time code bit is transmitted using [[direct-sequence spread spectrum]]. The bit is mixed with a 512-bit pseudo-random [[chip (CDMA)|chip]] sequence and encoded on the carrier using ±13° [[phase-shift keying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.ptb.de/cms/en/fachabteilungen/abt4/fb-44/ag-442/dissemination-of-legal-time/dcf77/dcf77-phase-modulation.html |title=DCF77 phase modulation |publisher=Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chip sequence contains equal amounts of each phase, so the average phase remains unchanged. Each chip spans 120 cycles of the carrier, so the exact duration is cycles 15500 through 76940 out of 77500. The last 560 cycles (7.22 ms) of each second are not phase-modulated.&lt;ref name="phasemod"&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://www.ptb.de/cms/fileadmin/internet/fachabteilungen/abteilung_4/4.4_zeit_und_frequenz/pdf/5_1988_Hetzel_-_Proc_EFTF_88.pdf |title=Time dissemination via the LF transmitter DCF77 using a pseudo-random phase-shift keying of the carrier |first=P. |last=Hetzel |date=16 March 1988 |conference=2nd European Frequency and Time Forum |location=Neuchâtel |pages=351–364 |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chip sequence is generated by a 9-bit [[linear feedback shift register]] (LFSR), repeats every second, and begins with 00000100011000010011100101010110000….

A software implementation of a Galois LFSR can generate the full chip sequence:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
  unsigned int i, lfsr;

  lfsr = 0;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 512; i++) {

    unsigned int chip;

    chip = lfsr &amp; 1;
    output_chip(chip);

    lfsr &gt;&gt;= 1;
    if (chip || !lfsr)
      lfsr ^= 0x110;

Each time code bit to be transmitted is [[exclusive-or]]ed with the LFSR output. The final chipped sequence is used to modulate the transmitter phase. During 0 chips the carrier is transmitted with a +13° phase advance, while during 1 chips it is transmitted with a −13° phase lag.

In lieu of the special minute marker used in the amplitude code, bit 59 is transmitted as an ordinary 0-bit, and the first 10 bits (seconds 0–9) are transmitted as binary 1.

When compared to amplitude modulation, phase modulation makes better use of the available frequency spectrum and results in a more precise low frequency time distribution with less sensitivity to interferences. Phase modulation is however not used by many DCF77 receivers. The reason for this is the worldwide availability of the [[GNSS applications|(precise time reference) signals]] transmitted by [[satellite navigation system|global navigation satellite system]]s like the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and [[GLONASS]]. Due to the GPS signal structure and the larger bandwidth available, the GPS reception would, in principle, achieve an uncertainty of the time transmission that is lower by at least [[orders of magnitude (time)|one order of magnitude]] than the uncertainty that can be achieved with DCF77 phase modulation receiving hardware (GPS time is accurate to about ± 10 to 30 [[nanosecond]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David W.

=== Time code interpretation ===
The time is represented in [[binary-coded decimal]]. It represents civil time, including summer time adjustments. The time transmitted is the time of the ''following'' minute; e.g. during December 31 23:59, the transmitted time encodes January 1 00:00.&lt;ref name=timecode&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.ptb.de/en/org/4/44/442/dcf77_kode_e.htm |title=DCF77 time code |publisher=Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt |date=2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 20 seconds are special flags. The minutes are encoded in seconds 21–28, hours during seconds 29–34, and the date during seconds 36–58.

Two flags warn of changes to occur at the end of the current hour: a change of time zones, and a leap second insertion. These flags are set during the hour up to the event. This includes the last minute before the event, during which the other time code bits (including the time zone indicator bits) encode the time of the first minute after the event.

In the event of an added leap second, a 0-bit is inserted during second 59, and the special missing bit is transmitted during the leap second itself, second 60.&lt;ref name=timecode/&gt;

Although the time code only includes two digits of year, it is possible to deduce two bits of century using the day of week. There is still a 400-year ambiguity, as the [[Gregorian calendar]] repeats weeks every 400 years, but this is sufficient to determine which years ending in 00 are leap years.&lt;ref&gt;The date XX00-02-28 must fall on a Monday, Sunday, Friday, or Wednesday. Only the first case is a leap year, followed by Tuesday the 29th. In the other three cases, the next day is March 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The time zone bits can be considered a binary-coded representation of the [[UTC]] offset. Z1 set indicates [[UTC+2]], while Z2 indicates [[UTC+1]].

The phase modulation generally encodes the same data as the amplitude modulation, but differs for bits 59 through 14, inclusive. Bit 59 (no amplitude modulation) is phase-modulated as a 0-bit. Bits 0–9 are phase modulated as 1 bits, and bits 10–14 are phase modulated as 0 bits.&lt;ref name="Engeler"&gt;{{Citation |title=Performance analysis and receiver architectures of DCF77 radio-controlled clocks |first=Daniel |last=Engeler |journal=IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics and Frequency Control |volume=59 |issue=5 |date=May 2012 |pages=869–884 |doi=10.1109/TUFFC.2012.2272 |url=http://caxapa.ru/thumbs/417284/Engeler_DCF77.pdf |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The civil protection warnings and weather information is not included in the phase-modulated data.

==Reception area==
[[Image:Dcf weite.jpg|thumb|DCF77 reception area from Mainflingen]]
[[File:Síla signalu DCF Nerja.png|thumb|DCF77 signal strength over a 24-hour period measured in [[Nerja]], on the south coast of Spain {{convert|1801|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the transmitter. Early at night it peaks at ≈ 100 µV/m signal strength.]]

With a relatively high power of {{nowrap|50 kW}}, the DCF77 transmissions can reliably be received in large parts of Europe, as far as {{convert|2000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the transmitter in Mainflingen. Within this range the [[signal strength]] of the DCF77 signal as specified by the [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt]] (PTB) is ≥ 100 µV/m. This signal strength assessment was made according to the reflection model with a reflection (one hop) on the [[ionospheric]] D-layer. As an example, reception with consumer grade clocks&amp;nbsp;— assuming the employed radio clock can manage reception with ≈ 100 µV/m signal strength&amp;nbsp;— is possible in Norway (Bodø), Russia (Moscow), Turkey (Istanbul), Gibraltar and Portugal (during night hours). Metal structures or interference caused by other electronic devices can cause reception problems within this range.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.meinbergglobal.com/english/faq/faq_21.htm In which area can the DCF77 time signal be received?]&lt;/ref&gt; At shorter distances the DCF77 signal strength is much higher. As an example, under {{convert|500|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the transmitter in Mainflingen the expected signal strength of the [[ground wave]] is ≥ 1 mV/m.&lt;ref name="Reach of DCF77"&gt;[http://www.ptb.de/cms/en/fachabteilungen/abt4/fb-44/ag-442/dissemination-of-legal-time/dcf77/reach-of-dcf77.html Reach of DCF77]&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on signal [[radio propagation|propagation]] and multiple reflections (hops) and local interference the DCF77 signal can sometimes be received further away (see [[tropospheric propagation]]). This is associated with a significant decrease in the signal strength and depends on many factors, e.g., the daytime and season, the angle of incidence of the [[skywave]] on the D-layer and the solar activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heret.de/funkuhr/reichw.htm |title=Reichweite des DCF77-Senders |work=Die Funk-Uhr Homepage |publisher=Robert Heret und Thomas Losert |accessdate=2010-12-12 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control==
[[File:Atomuhr-CS2.jpg|thumb|Atomic master clock CS2 in use at the [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt|PTB]] to check for deviations]]

The control signal is not transmitted by wire from the [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt]] (PTB) in Braunschweig to the transmitting radio station in Mainflingen but is generated at the place of emission using a control unit developed by the PTB. This control unit, which is housed in an air conditioned room of the transmitting station, is shielded against high-frequency interferences and controlled from Braunschweig. For reasons of operational reliability, the control signal is generated by three independent control channels all equipped with their own caesium atomic clock. In addition a rubidium atomic clock is available on site. To avoid incorrect emissions the output of these three channels are compared in two electronic switch circuits on site. Output for transmission is only generated when at least two of the three channels are in agreement. Via the public telephone network operational data of the control unit can be called up with the aid of a telecontrol system. Furthermore, the carrier phase time and the states of the second markers are compared in Braunschweig with the setpoints specified by the PTB's atomic master clocks that provide the UTC(PTB). Of these atomic clocks the CS2 atomic clock in Braunschweig provides the German national legal time standard, and can be used as a highly accurate frequency standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptb.de/cms/en/themenrundgaenge/wegweiser/fragenzurzeit/fragenzurzeit12.html With what accuracy do PTB's atomic clocks work?]&lt;/ref&gt;
If there are deviations, the necessary corrections will be made via the telecontrol system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptb.de/cms/en/themenrundgaenge/wegweiser/fragenzurzeit/fragenzurzeit10.html How is time transmitted?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy==

===Transmission===
The DCF77 transmitted [[carrier frequency]] relative uncertainty is 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; over a 24-hour period and 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; over 100 days, with a deviation in phase with respect to UTC that never exceeds 5.5 ± 0.3 [[microsecond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptb.de/cms/en/fachabteilungen/abt4/fb-44/ag-442/dissemination-of-legal-time/dcf77/dcf77-carrier-frequency.html DCF77 carrier frequency]&lt;/ref&gt; The four German primary caesium (fountain) atomic clocks (CS1, CS2, CSF1 and CSF2) in use by the PTB in Braunschweig ensure significantly less long term [[clock drift]] than the atomic clocks used in the DCF77 facility in Mainflingen. With the aid of external corrections from Braunschweig the control unit of DCF77 in Mainflingen is expected to neither gain nor lose a second in approximately 300,000 years.

In theory, a DCF77 controlled external clock should be able to synchronize to within one half of the period of the transmitted 77.5 kHz carrier frequency of the DCF77 signal, or within ± 6.452 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; s or ± 6.452 microseconds.&lt;ref name="phasemod"/&gt;

===Reception===
[[File:Inside radio clock.jpg|thumb|Consumer grade radio clock movement with the DCF77 receiver (right) in the clock. The small ferrite [[Loop antenna#AM broadcast receiver loop antennas|loopstick antenna]] used in this alarm clock can be seen at the left.]]

Due to the propagation process, phase and/or frequency shifts observed in received signals the practical obtainable accuracy is lower than originally realized with the atomic clocks at the place of transmission. As with any [[Atomic clock#Time signal radio transmitters|time signal radio transmitter]] the precise establishment of time is affected by the distance to the transmitter, as the time signal propagates to a time signal receiver at the [[speed of light]]. For a DCF77 receiver located {{convert|1000|km|mi|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} away from the DCF77 transmitter, due to transit delay the receiver will be set more than 3 [[millisecond]]s late. Such a small deviation will seldom be of interest and if desired instrument grade time receivers can be corrected for transit delay.

Further inaccuracies may be caused by the type of wave the receiver records. In case of just ground wave reception a constant is included in the calculation if the distance is permanent. In case of just space wave reception the reception side cannot influence the time fluctuations. Time fluctuations are influenced directly by the changing altitude of the reflecting and bending layer of the ionosphere. Similar problems arise where [[surface wave|ground]] and [[skywave]]s overlap. This field is not constant but changes in the course of the day between approximately {{convert|600|to|1100|km|mi|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} from the transmitter position.&lt;ref name="Reach of DCF77"/&gt;

Corrected instrument grade DCF77 receivers, using the amplitude-modulated time signals with accompanying antennas oriented [[tangent]]ial to the transmitter's antenna in Mainflingern to ensure the best possible interference-free time signal reception at fixed locations, can achieve a practical accuracy uncertainty better than ± 2 milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hopf-time.com/en/dcf-info.htm How the DCF77-receiver works]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the amplitude-modulated time signal transmission this information is also transmitted since June 1983 by DCF77 via a [[phase modulation]] of the carrier wave with a [[pseudorandom noise]] sequence of 512 bits length. Using [[cross-correlation]] the reproduced signal at the receiving end can be used to determine the beginning of the second markers much more accurately. The drawback of using phase-modulated time signals lies in the complex instrument grade receiving hardware required for using this time signal reception method. Using this method the [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt]] (PTB) measured standard deviations of ± 2 to 22 microseconds between UTC(PTB) and UTC(DCF77), depending on the time in the day and season. This was done in Braunschweig located {{convert|273|km|mi|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} from the transmitter in Mainflingen.&lt;ref name="phasemod"/&gt;

Normal low cost consumer grade DCF77 receivers solely rely on the amplitude-modulated time signals and use narrow band receivers (with 10&amp;nbsp;Hz bandwidth) with small ferrite [[Loop antenna#AM broadcast receiver loop antennas|loopstick antennas]] and circuits with non optimal digital signal processing delay and can therefore only be expected to determine the beginning of a second with a practical accuracy uncertainty of ± 0.1 second. This is sufficient for radio controlled low cost consumer grade clocks and watches using standard-quality [[quartz clock]]s for timekeeping between daily DCF77 synchronization attempts, as they will be most accurate immediately after a successful synchronization and will become less accurate from that point forward until the next synchronization.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Lombardi, [http://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/2429.pdf "How Accurate is a Radio Controlled Clock?], National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Děti Země''' (Children of the Earth - COE) is a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] citizens' association for environmental protection. 

COE was founded in September 1989, shortly before the [[Velvet revolution]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], as an unofficial initiative of several ecological activists in [[Prague]].

In the last two decades Dětí Země lobbied for [[ozone layer]] protection, sustainable transport&lt;ref name=detizeme.cz&gt;{{cite web|title=Vlaky a autobusy budou v Libereckém kraji jezdit zadarmo|url=http://www.detizeme.cz/denbezaut/ukaz.php?co=aktualita&amp;id=11|publisher=detizeme.cz|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and air quality,&lt;ref name=denik&gt;{{cite web|last=Země|first=Děti|title=Jak zplodiny z aut škodí lidskému zdraví?|url=http://denik.obce.cz/clanek.asp?id=6333407|publisher=Denik Verejna Sprava|accessdate=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; among other issues.

[[Image:Flag of Pretoria.svg|right|300px|thumb|The [[flag]] of the city of [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]].]]

The '''flag of Pretoria''' is the [[flag]] that represents the [[city]] of [[Pretoria]], the administrative capital of [[South Africa]]. The flag is simple in design, as it has only two colours, red and yellow. [[Red]] is located on the top half, while [[yellow]] is on the bottom portion. These colours are the official city colours, derived from the city arms.

'''''Fonds d'Investissements pour le Developpement Économique et Social''''' ''(FIDES)'' was the [[France|French]] [[infrastructure]] that delivered aid to its [[French colonial empire|colonies]], particularly in [[Africa]].

It was widely criticized for having failed in many development programs. [[René Dumont]] (1962) writes of FIDES:&lt;blockquote&gt;
"within the framework of FIDES very large sums were granted to [[French colonial empire|French-speaking Africa]]. In face of the immense needs, however, they seemed quite modest. The aid could in fact have been increased many times without a corresponding tax pressure, had [[France]] had the courage politically to [[Decolonization|decolonize]] more rapidly. Forty-six percent of the FIDES grants, particularly in the first four-year plan, were used to build roads, ports and airports. These were indispensable to open up the countries, but could have been achieved at less cost."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dumont|first=René|year=1969|title=False Start in Africa|publisher=Frederick A. Praeger, Inc.|location=New York|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paul Nugent (2004)
"The consensus among historians is that FIDES amounted to much more than an ideological figleaf. It did channel substantial resources into the African colonies - initially ( as in the British case) into infrastructural development, but later also into industrial entreprises and agricultural projects."&lt;ref&gt;Nugent, Paul (2004) Africa since independence, Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ouessant'' (S623)''' is an {{sclass-|Agosta|submarine}} built for the [[French Navy]]. She was completed at the [[Arsenal de Cherbourg]] in 1978 and served the French Navy until her 2001 [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|decommissioning]]. From 2005 to 2009, ''Ouessant'' was employed as a training vessel to train [[Royal Malaysian Navy]] personnel who will operate the two French-built {{sclass2-|Scorpène|submarine|2}}s planned for the Royal Malaysian Navy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2794">The '''Judiciary of Angola''' is defined by the Constitution of [[Angola]], which outlines the structure of a Unified Justice System  (''Sistema Unificado de Justica''). The courts are intended to be independent sovereign bodies administering impartial justice on behalf of the people. Their duty is to guarantee and ensure compliance with the Constitutional and other laws in force, to protect the rights and interests of citizens and institutions and to decide on the legality of administrative acts. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Angola.html#_1.3_The_Courts|title= Republic of Angola - Legal System and Research|publisher= Hauser Global Law|accessdate = 27 February 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

At the lowest level the system involves Municipal Courts, trial courts whose judges are usually laymen. Appeals in civil matters are heard by the Provincial Court and in criminal matters by the Supreme Court.

Provincial Courts administered by the Ministry of Justice and located in each of the 18 provincial capitals (two in Benguela Province) ae trial courts whose judges are nominated by the Supreme Court. Judges of the Provincial Courts, along with two laymen, act as a jury. 

The Supreme Court (''Tribunal Supremo''), founded in 1985 and based in [[Luanda]], hears appeals from the lower courts. It is divided into three chambers, namely the Criminal, Civil and Administration and Working Chambers and is composed of the President of the court, a vice-President and 16 judges, all appointed by the President of Angola. The President of the Supreme Court is known as the Chief Justice.

A Constitutional Court was founded in 2008 to act as the guardian of the Constitution. It is composed of 11 judges, four appointed by the President, four by the National Assembly, two by the Superior Council of the Judiciary, and one by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tribunalconstitucional.ao/Conteudos/Artigos/detalhe_artigo.aspx?idc=148&amp;idsc=156&amp;idl=1|title=Tribunal Constitucional de Angola - Tribunal|website=www.tribunalconstitucional.ao|language=pt|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other specialised courts are the Supreme Military Court (''Supremo Tribunal Militar'') and the Auditing Court (Tribunal de Contas).

The list below includes all entities falling even partially under any of the [[regions of Europe|various common definitions of Europe]], geographical or political. Fifty-six generally recognized sovereign states, one de facto state with limited, but substantial, international recognition, and five largely unrecognized de facto states with limited to no recognition, are listed with territory in [[Europe]] and/or membership in international European organisations. There are eight areas that are not integral parts of a European state or have special political status.

==Geographical boundaries of Europe==
{{Main|Europe|Boundaries between the continents of Earth}}

Under the commonly used geographic definition, the [[boundaries between the continents of Earth|border]] between [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] stretches along the [[Ural Mountains]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles T. Evans |url=http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/HIS241/Notes/Geography/Urals.html |title=Ural Mountains |publisher=Novaonline.nvcc.edu |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ural River]], and [[Caspian Sea]] in the east,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.howstuffworks.com/asia/the-ural-river.htm |title=The Ural River |publisher=Geography.howstuffworks.com |date=2008-03-30 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Greater Caucasus]] range&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles T. Evans |url=http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/HIS241/Notes/Geography/Caucasus.html |title=Caucasus Mountains |publisher=Novaonline.nvcc.edu |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Black Sea]], with its outlets, the [[Bosphorus]] and [[Dardanelles]], in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles T. Evans |url=http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/HIS241/Notes/Geography/Black.html |title=Black Sea |publisher=Novaonline.nvcc.edu |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopaedia 2007 |title=Europe |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopaedia_761570768/Europe.html |accessdate=2007-12-27 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbxqnne?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570768/Europe.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encarta"/&gt; Based on that division, [[list of transcontinental countries|transcontinental states]] [[Azerbaijan]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]], and [[Turkey]] have territory both in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

The [[island]] of [[Cyprus]] in [[Western Asia]] is proximate to [[Anatolia]] (or [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]]), but often considered part of Europe and is a current member of the [[European Union]] (EU). [[Armenia]] is also entirely in [[Western Asia]] but is a member of certain European organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/aboutCoe/index.asp?page=47pays1europe&amp; |title=Council of Europe in Brief |publisher=Coe.int |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722013253/http://www.coe.int/aboutCoe/index.asp?page=47pays1europe&amp; |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Mediterranean Sea]] provides a clearer divide between [[Africa]] and [[Europe]], some traditionally European islands such as [[Malta]], [[Sicily]], [[Pantelleria]] and the [[Pelagian Islands]] are located on the African continental plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA269141 |title=Geological Development of the Sicilian-Tunisian Platform held in Italy (University of Urbino) on November 4, 5, 6, 1992 |publisher=Oai.dtic.mil |date=1992-11-06 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island of [[Iceland]] is part of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], straddling the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/understanding.html |title=Understanding plate motions [This Dynamic Earth, USGS&amp;#93; |publisher=Pubs.usgs.gov |date=1994-06-09 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some territories geographically outside Europe have strong connections with European states. [[Greenland]] has socio-political connections with Europe and is part of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], but closer to the continent of [[North America]] and usually grouped with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gl.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes [[Israel]] is considered as part of [[regions of Europe|geopolitical Europe]] as well.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Other territories are part of European countries but are geographically located in other continents, such as the [[French overseas departments]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Connor |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5106531,00.html |title=French overseas territories vote to remain close to Paris |publisher=Dw-world.de |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Spanish cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] on the coast of Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/4209538.stm |title=Regions and territories: Ceuta, Melilla |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dutch Caribbean]] territories of [[Bonaire]], [[Saba]] and [[Sint Eustatius]].&lt;ref name="Netherlands"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nl.html |title=Netherlands |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Europe countries map en 2.png|thumb|right|Political map of Europe and the surrounding region]]

==Generally recognized sovereign states==
A [[sovereign state]] is a political association with effective [[sovereignty]] over a population for whom it makes decisions in the national interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mil.sagepub.com/content/17/2/227.short |title=Untying the Sovereign State: A Double Reading of the Anarchy Problematique |publisher=Mil.sagepub.com |date=1988-06-01 |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Montevideo convention]], a state must have a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/sovereignty/montevideo-convention-rights-duties-states/p15897 |title=Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States - Council on Foreign Relations |publisher=Cfr.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognised states===
There are 50 internationally recognised sovereign states with territory located within the common definition of Europe and/or membership in international European organisations, of which 44 have their [[capital city]] within Europe. All are either member or observer states of the [[United Nations]] (UN),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/members/ |title=United Nations Member States |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all except Belarus, Kazakhstan and Vatican City are members of the [[Council of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/aboutcoe/index.asp?page=47pays1europe |title=47 countries, 1 Europe |publisher=Council of Europe |accessdate=17 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319025613/http://www.coe.int/aboutCoe/index.asp?page=47pays1europe |archivedate=19 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 28 of these countries have also been [[Member state of the European Union|member states of the EU]] since 2013, which means they are highly integrated with each other and share their sovereignty with [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]].

Each entry in the list below has a map of its location in Europe. Territory in Europe is shown in dark-green; territory not geographically in Europe is shown in a lighter shade of green. The lightest shade of green represents states in the EU and is shown on the maps of all territories within the EU.

===De facto state with substantial, but limited, recognition===

The following state, although not a member or observer of the UN, has, since declaring independence, achieved a considerable percentage of diplomatic recognitions (although slightly below the threshold of wide recognition) and exercises tangible control of most of its claimed territory. In addition, it has been accepted for membership in several international organizations, including two UN agencies, and it currently is seeking EU membership.

===De facto states with little or no international recognition===
The following five entities in Europe have partial [[diplomatic recognition]] by one or more [[member states of the United Nations|UN member states]] (and therefore are defined as states by the [[Sovereign state#Constitutive theory|constitutive theory of statehood]]) or have no [[diplomatic recognition]] by any UN member state but are defined as states by the [[Sovereign state#Declarative theory|declarative theory of statehood]] and are recognised by one or more non-UN member states due to disputes of their sovereignties. None are members of the UN, Council of Europe or EU.

The '''Lower North Sea Group''' (abbreviation: NL) is a [[group (stratigraphy)|group]] of [[formation (stratigraphy)|geologic formations]] in the [[Subsurface (geology)|subsurface]] of the [[Netherlands]] and adjacent parts of the [[North Sea]]. 

The group is part of the [[North Sea Supergroup]] and consists of two marine formations of early [[Paleogene]] age, the older [[Landen Formation]] and younger [[Dongen Formation]]. It is in most places stratigraphically on top of the [[Late Cretaceous]] [[Chalk Group]] and overlain by the late Paleogene [[Middle North Sea Group]].

The Lower North Sea Group [[outcrop|crops out]] in a few spots in the south of the Netherlands but is mostly overlain by younger deposits. It can be found in the subsurface of most of the Netherlands.

'''Montenegrin Argentines''' are people born in [[Argentina]] of [[Montenegrins|Montenegrin]] descent. During the early 1900s, Montenegrins from the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] began emigrating to the country, and nowadays there are approximately 50,000 Montenegrins and descendants living in Argentina. Besides Poles (450,000) and Croatians (440,000) they are one of the most populous Slavic communities in Argentina. Currently most of them are located in the northern province of [[Chaco Province|Chaco]], while the remaining part lives in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Tandil]], [[Venado Tuerto]], and General Madariaga, a town of around 5,000 inhabitants.

Descendants of ethnic [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] established ''Colonia La Montenegrina'', the largest Montenegrin colony in South America, in which they are part of even today. General Madariaga is a specially important place for Montegrins in Argentina since many of them have achieved a remarkable wealth there through the business of cattle breeding, and most Montenegrins and their descendants are buried in its cemetery. Additionally, the Montenegrin-Argentine organization, Yugoslav Society Njegoš (''Sociedad Yugoslava Njegoš'', previously called the Montenegrin Society and Montenegrin-Yugoslav Society for Mutual Aid before World War II) provides mutual aid inside the town.

'''Mutanabbi Street''' ([[Arabian Peninsula|Arabic]]: '''شارع المتنبي''') is located in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], near the old quarter of Baghdad; at [[Al Rasheed Street]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/08/26/culture/ The death of Al Mutanabbi Street]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the historic center of Baghdad bookselling, a street filled with bookstores and outdoor book stalls. It was named after the 10th-century classical [[Iraq]]i poet [[Al-Mutanabbi]].
This street is well established for bookselling and has often been referred to as the heart and soul of the Baghdad literacy and intellectual community. 

A car bomb exploded and killed 26 people on Mutanabbi Street on March 5, 2007, leaving the area littered and unsafe for shoppers, and destroying many businesses.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; In response to the bombing, [[Deema Shehabi]] and Beau Beausoleil edited an anthology in 2012 called ''Al-Mutanabbi Street Starts Here'' of people's responses to the bombing. The 100 contributors included [[The Narcicyst|Yassin Alsalman]] and Pulitzer prize-winning journalist [[Anthony Shadid]], among others.&lt;ref name="Bramley (2014)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bramley|first1=Ellie Violet|title=Literary project honours Baghdad's devastated bookselling district|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/21/literary-project-baghdad-bookselling-district|accessdate=18 April 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=21 January 2014|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2008, [[Iraqi Prime Minister]] [[Nouri al-Maliki]] officially reopened the street after a long period of cleanup and repair.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Then and Now: A New Chapter for Baghdad Book Market|url=http://baghdadbureau.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/then-and-now-a-new-chapter-for-baghdad-book-market/?hp | work=The New York Times | first=Eric | last=Owles | date=December 18, 2008 | accessdate=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mwanzo''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by [[Sauti Sol]], a Kenyan afro-pop band. It was released on August 4, 2009 by Penya Records.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mwanzo/dp/B002GLC72U |title=Mwanzo – Sauti Sol |date=4 August 2009 |publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]] |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Singles==
* "Lazizi" was released as the album's [[lead single]]. The song became popular among the band's fans, with other musicians performing their own [[cover version]]s of it. The song is about an ordinary man's plea to get a lady's number, so he can at least plan to take her out on a date, and earned the band thousands of fans across [[East Africa]].{{Citation needed|reason=Such claims require reliable sources. |date=August 2014}}
* "Blue Uniform" was released as the album's second single. It depicts police harassment towards the youth in Kenya. The band's singers Bien-Aimé Baraza, Willis Austin Chimano and Delvin Mudigi divide their verses into three personas: an innocent arrested youth, a bad police officer and another who explains why police officers sometimes get into corruption, with the story ending with the policeman releasing the youth with a stern warning.
* "Sunny Days" and "Nairobi" were released as the album's third and fourth singles, respectively. Featuring soul singer Stan, "Nairobi" is a tribute to [[Nairobi]]'s beauty, sunshine, people, history, arts and culture.{{Citation needed|reason=The descriptions of the music videos and the chronology of the singles' releases require adequate references. |date=August 2014}}

'''Okongo''' is a constituency in the [[Ohangwena Region]] of [[Namibia]], on the border to [[Angola]]. It has 21,321 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statoids.com/yna.html Constituencies of Namibia, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; The main settlement and district capital is [[Okongo]].

==Politics==
As is common in all constituencies of former [[Owamboland]], Namibia's ruling [[South West Africa People's Organization|SWAPO Party]] won the [[Namibian local and regional elections, 2015|2015 regional election]] by a landslide. Its candidate [[Fanuel Ndadi]] gathered 5,766 votes, while the only opposition candidate, Waldeheim Kanalelo of the [[Rally for Democracy and Progress (Namibia)|Rally for Democracy and Progress]] (RDP), received 241 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Regional Council Election Results 2015 | publisher=[[Electoral Commission of Namibia]] | date=3 December 2015 | page=13 | url=http://www.ecn.na/documents/27857/223442/Regional+Counils+Election+Results_Duly+elected+candidates+2015.pdf/32493774-80b3-4be3-9ca1-1f6ce187673a?version=1.0 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208163948/http://www.ecn.na/documents/27857/223442/Regional+Counils+Election+Results_Duly+elected+candidates+2015.pdf/32493774-80b3-4be3-9ca1-1f6ce187673a?version=1.0 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=8 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Roman Curia}}
The '''Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Health Care Workers''' was set up on 11 February 1985 by [[Pope John Paul II]] who reformed the Pontifical Commission for the Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers into its new form in 1988. It was part of the [[Roman Curia]].

Effective 1 January 2017, the work of the Council was assumed by the [[Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = National Catholic Reporter | date = 31 August 2016 | accessdate = 31 August 2016 | first = Joshua J. | last = McElwee | url = https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/francis-creates-new-vatican-office-charity-justice-peace-migration | title = Francis creates new Vatican office for charity, justice, peace, migration }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://gosc.pl/doc/3625382.Start-najnowszej-watykanskiej-dykasterii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''[[Pastor Bonus]]'' describes the work of the council as:

*''Art. 152 — The Pontifical Council for Pastoral Assistance to Health Care Workers shows the solicitude of the Church for the sick by helping those who serve the sick and suffering, so that their apostolate of mercy may ever more effectively respond to people’s needs.
*Art. 153 — § 1. The Council is to spread the Church’s teaching on the spiritual and moral aspects of illness as well as the meaning of human suffering'' [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19880628_pastor-bonus-roman-curia_en.html#PONTIFICAL%20COUNCILS].

Its tasks also include coordinating the activities of different [[dicasteries]] of the Roman Curia as they relate to health care. The Pontifical Council explains and defends the teachings of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] on health issues. The Council also follows and studies programs and initiatives of health care policy at both international and national levels, with the goal of extracting its relevance and implications for the pastoral care of the Church.

The office of President was left vacant following the death of [[Archbishop]] [[Zygmunt Zimowski]] in July 2016. Monsignor [[Jean-Marie Musivi Mupendawatu]] was the last Secretary of the council. The council was suppressed effective 1 January 2017 with the creation of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development with Cardinal Turkson as the inaugural prefect.

==Work with AIDS patients==
In November 1989 at the annual conference of the Pontifical Council at the Vatican, recognition was given to an American priest from Massachusetts, Rev [[James Martin Graham]], who was the director of the Archdiocese of Hartford's Office of AIDS Ministry, who pleaded for better communication efforts between the Church and governmental health agencies to share information to better combat AIDS. As a result of his proposal, Graham was appointed by then Archbishop Fiorenzo Angelini as the director of the new International Christian AIDS Network (ICAN). As a follow up to this appointment, Archbishop Angelini traveled to the United States in June 1990 and visited Graham's Sts. Martin &amp; James Respite, a hospice and living facility for HIV-positive and AIDS patients in Waterbury, Connecticut, where a 24-hour care residence was named for him. Archbishop Angelini met with several of the patients and gave Father Graham a silver stalk of wheat that would serve as the handle on the door of the Respite's Chapel tabernacle. In an interview with American television, the Archbishop remarked that Graham's Respite was recognized by the Pontifical Council as a model facility that should be followed to make treatment and spiritual care of HIV-positive and AIDS patients available for all. The work of ICAN was short-lived, however, for Father Graham died in 1997.

Monsignor Mupendawatu said, in an interview on Thursday, July 21, 2011 with the semi-official Vatican newspaper [[L'Osservatore Romano]], that a papal foundation affiliated with the Pontifical Council, that is dedicated largely to [[AIDS]] patients, may expand its services to include a global program of distributing [[anti-AIDS drugs]].

The initiative would respond to a shortage of [[antiretroviral drugs]] and other drugs in poorer countries, where the vast majority of AIDS patients receive no adequate treatment.

Mupendawatu is a delegate to the [[Good Samaritan Foundation]], established by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2004, to provide economic support to the sick who are most in need, particularly those suffering from AIDS.

Mupendawatu said the Foundation planned to strengthen its activity, particularly in [[Africa]], by increasing its promotion of donations of pharmaceutical and medical material, and by working more closely with local Catholic leaders to place the Church in the forefront of the care for AIDS patients.

To favor these efforts, he said, the foundation may open offices on every continent, which would function in coordination with the central office at the Vatican in Rome.

"The foundation is also studying the possibility of creating its own 'pharmaceutical center' which would allow the collection and distribution of medicines in poor countries," he said. The center would work in cooperation with other church agencies.

Mupendawatu said that while more than 25 percent of the global health care to AIDS patients is provided by Catholic institutions, the church needs to do even more in the face of the epidemic, which infects about 7,000 additional people each day.

One of the church's priorities is to help make "universal and free access to treatment" a reality for all those infected with AIDS, he said. Today, only about 5 percent of people with AIDS patients receive adequate care, he said.

"It is enough to realize that the majority of AIDS patients in Africa live on a dollar a day and cannot afford any treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to reach the essential goal of no-cost drugs," he said.

Mupendawatu said the church's insistence that education in responsible sexuality be at least a part of any anti-AIDS strategy has found appreciation in scientific circles, in fact, contrary to what the public has been led to believe. The church's position is that effective [[prevention of AIDS]] must include the abandonment of high-risk behavior and the adoption of a "balanced sexuality" based on permanent [[monogamy]]- the inclusion of total premarital chastity and lasting full [[marital fidelity]], he said.

He noted that [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s monthly prayer intention for July evoked the church's commitment to AIDS sufferers: "That Christians may ease the physical and spiritual sufferings of those who are sick with AIDS, especially in the poorest countries."

'''Radio Caroline''' is a British radio station founded in 1964 by [[Ronan O'Rahilly]] to circumvent the record companies' control of popular music broadcasting in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[BBC]]'s radio broadcasting monopoly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Harris |first = Paul |authorlink = Paul Harris (author) |title = Broadcasting From The High Seas |publisher = Paul Harris Publishing Edinburgh |year = 1977 |isbn = 0-904505-07-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlicensed by any government for most of its early life, it was a [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate radio]] station that never actually became illegal, although after the [[Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967|Marine Offences Act]] (1967) it became illegal for a British subject to  associate with it.

The Radio Caroline name was used to broadcast from international waters, using five different ships of three different owners, from 1964 to 1990, and via satellite from 1998 to 2013.  Since 19 August 2000, Radio Caroline has also broadcast 24 hours a day via the internet and by the occasional [[Restricted Service Licence|restricted service licence]].  Currently they also broadcast on [[Digital radio in the United Kingdom|DAB radio]] in certain areas of the UK: these services are part of the [[Ofcom]] small-scale DAB+ trials.  Caroline can be heard on DAB+ in [[Aldershot]], [[Birmingham]], [[Brighton]], [[Glasgow]], [[Norwich]], [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;https://radiotoday.co.uk/2018/04/radio-caroline-now-available-on-london-dab/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portsmouth]] and [[Woking]]. 

In May 2017 [[Ofcom]] awarded the station an [[AM broadcasting|AM]] community licence to broadcast to Suffolk and north Essex;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/media/media-releases/2017/ofcom-awards-five-new-am-community-radio-licences|title=Ofcom awards five new AM community radio licences|website=Ofcom|language=en|access-date=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; full-time AM (medium wave) broadcasting, via a previously redundant BBC World Service transmitter mast at [[Orfordness transmitting station|Orford Ness]], commenced on 22 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://tx.mb21.co.uk/gallery/orfordness.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Caroline broadcasts music from the 1960s to contemporary, with an emphasis on [[album-oriented rock]] (AOR) and "new" music from "carefully selected albums".  On 1 January 2016, a second channel was launched called Caroline Flashback, playing pop music from the late 1950s to the early 1980s.

===Origins===
[[File:Mi Amigo kleine.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[MV Mi Amigo|MV ''Mi Amigo'']], c. 1974, which had been used as the home of Radio Caroline South from 1964–1967]]

Radio Caroline was begun by Irish musician manager and businessman [[Ronan O'Rahilly]]. O'Rahilly failed to obtain airplay on [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] for [[Georgie Fame]]'s records because it was committed to sponsored programmes promoting major record labels; [[EMI]], [[Decca Records|Decca]], [[Pye Records|Pye]] and [[Philips Records|Philips]].

Encouraged by Scandinavian and Dutch pirates, in February 1964 O'Rahilly obtained the 702-ton former Danish passenger ferry, ''Fredericia'', which was converted into a radio ship at the Irish port of [[Greenore]], owned by O'Rahilly's father. At the same time, Allan Crawford's ''Project Atlanta'' was equipping the [[MV Mi Amigo|MV ''Mi Amigo'']] at Greenore, where the two competed to be the first on air.&lt;ref name="Henry/von Joel"&gt;{{cite book

|authors = Mike von Joel and Stuart Henry
|publisher = Blandford Press
|place = Poole, Dorset
|year = 1984
|isbn = 0-7137-1497-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial backing for the venture came from six investors, including John Sheffield, chairman of Norcross, Carl "Jimmy" Ross of Ross Foods, [[Jocelyn Stevens]] of [[Queen (magazine)|''Queen'']] magazine, with which Radio Caroline shared its first office.&lt;ref name="Colophon"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Rahilly named the station after [[Caroline Kennedy]], daughter of [[U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In an extant photo, Caroline Kennedy and her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., are apparently dancing in the oval office as their father looks on, an activity which O'Rahilly reportedly interpreted as a playful disruption of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk/#history_part_2.html|title=Snubbed by the radio and music establishment, O'Rahilly devises the sweet revenge of Radio Caroline|publisher=Radiocaroline.co.uk|accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Life Photo Archives, available online&lt;/ref&gt;

===First transmissions===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
The ''Fredericia'' was renamed MV ''Caroline'' and anchored off [[Felixstowe]], where it began test transmissions on Friday, 27 March 1964. On Saturday, 28 March, it began regular broadcasting at noon on 197.3 metres (1520&amp;nbsp;kHz, announced as 199 metres) with the opening conducted by [[Simon Dee]].&lt;ref&gt;name="Henry/von Joel"&lt;/ref&gt; The first programme, which was pre-recorded, was hosted by [[Christopher Moore (DJ)|Chris Moore]].  Radio Caroline's first musical theme was [[Jimmy McGriff]]'s "Round Midnight", a [[jazz standard]] co-composed by [[Thelonious Monk]]. In March 1964, [[The Fortunes]] recorded ''Caroline'', which became the station's theme. ''Round Midnight'' was confined to close down on Radio Caroline North after [[The World Tomorrow (1934)|The World Tomorrow]]. The station's slogan was ''Your all-day music station'', and it initially broadcast from 6{{nbsp}}am to 6{{nbsp}}pm, seven days a week.

Radio Caroline announced a wavelength of 199 metres, rhyming with the name, but was actually broadcasting on 197.3 metres (1520&amp;nbsp;kHz). Stations in the UK announced the wavelength in metres, and radios at that time were tuned using an analogue dial. The absence of precise digital readouts allowed for some leeway between the precise transmission frequency and the channel announced on the air. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] offshore station [[Radio Veronica]] was on 192 metres (1562&amp;nbsp;kHz) and [[Radio Atlanta]] broadcast on 201 (1493&amp;nbsp;kHz).

Radio Caroline's transmission output was almost 20 [[kW]], achieved by linking two 10&amp;nbsp;kW [[Continental Electronics]] transmitters. Broadcasting hours were 6{{nbsp}}am to 6{{nbsp}}pm to avoid competition from [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]]. After its close-down, the station returned at 8{{nbsp}}pm and continued until after midnight. This was to avoid competition with popular television programmes. Most of Radio Caroline's [[pop music]] programmes were targeted at housewives, and some later programming was aimed at children. Without serious competition, Radio Caroline gained a regular daytime audience of some 10 million.

===Merger with Radio Atlanta===
[[File:ERosko.jpg|upright|thumb|left|alt=Emperor Rosko|Emperor Rosko]]
On 2 July 1964, Radio Atlanta and Radio Caroline's companies, ''Project Atlanta'' and ''Planet Productions.'', announced the stations were to merge, with Crawford and O'Rahilly as joint managing directors. Radio Atlanta closed at 8{{nbsp}}pm that day. It was renamed '''Radio Caroline South''' and MV ''Mi Amigo'' remained off [[Frinton-on-Sea]] while MV ''Caroline'' broadcast as '''Radio Caroline North'''. MV ''Caroline'' sailed from Felixstowe to the Isle of Man, broadcasting as she went. The only broadcast staff on board were [[Tom Lodge]] and [[Jerry Leighton]]. MV ''Caroline'' arrived at her new anchorage in Ramsey Bay on 6 July 1964. The two stations were able to cover most of the British Isles. Later, some programmes were pre-recorded on land and broadcast simultaneously from both ships.

In October 1965, O'Rahilly bought Crawford's interest in the MV ''Mi Amigo'' and engaged [[Tom Lodge]] from Radio Caroline North to make programme changes and regain the audience from [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]]. Lodge hired new DJs and introduced free-form programming which, by August 1966, had succeeded, creating an audience of 23 million.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

When the US-backed  [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]] arrived off the coast of England, there was an unsuccessful attempt to merge its sales operation with that of Caroline before Radio London started transmissions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. The new station introduced British audiences to slick American-style top 40 radio with electronic jingles produced by Dallas-based [[PAMS]]  – and was an immediate success.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Broadcasting personnel===
Radio Caroline's first programme, on 28 March 1964, was presented by [[Christopher Moore (DJ)|Chris Moore]].&lt;ref name="Radio Caroline North"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/caroline/jimmurphy/history.htm |title=Radio Caroline North |year=1992 |work=Selling the Sixties by Robert Chapman, {{ISBN|0-415-07817-2}} |publisher=Routledge |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presenters [[Tony Blackburn]], [[Roger Gale]], [[Mike Allen (radio presenter)|Mike Allen]], [[Ray Teret]], [[Roger Day]], [[Simon Dee]], [[Tony Prince]], [[Spangles Muldoon]], [[Keith Skues]], [[Johnnie Walker (DJ)|Johnnie Walker]], [[Robbie Dale]], [[Dave Lee Travis]], [[Tommy Vance]], [[Tom Edwards (broadcaster)|Tom Edwards]], Paul Noble, Bob Stewart and [[Andy Archer (radio presenter)|Andy Archer]] became well known. Some DJs from the [[United States|USA]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, such as [[Graham_Webb_(broadcaster)|Graham Webb]], [[Emperor Rosko]], Steve Young, [[Keith Hampshire]], Colin Nicol and Norman St John, were also heard. DJ [[Jack Spector]], of the [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] "Good Guys" in New York, regularly recorded for Radio Caroline. Syndicated shows from the US and recorded religious programmes were also broadcast. [[BBC Radio 2]] newsreader [[Colin Berry]] and [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]]'s Nick Bailey started their careers reading the news on Radio Caroline South.

[[File:Tom Lodge 1966 - 2004.jpg|thumb|[[Tom Lodge]] was a radio disc jockey for Radio Caroline from 1964 until his death in 2012]]
In mid-September 1965, the crew and DJs on MV ''Mi Amigo'' were joined for the weekend by 1960s pop singer [[Sylvan Whittingham]], who visited the ship to promote her single "We Don't Belong". Whittingham was unable to leave on the tender when a storm arose. The only singer to stay overnight, she helped present programmes, make jingles, and close the station at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===''Mi Amigo'' runs aground===
On 20 January 1966, the MV ''Mi Amigo'' lost its anchor in a storm, drifted and ran aground on the beach at Frinton-on-Sea. The crew and broadcasting staff were rescued unharmed, but the ship's hull was damaged and repairs were carried out at [[Zaandam]], Netherlands. Between 31 January and 1 May, Radio Caroline South broadcast from the vessel ''Cheeta II'', owned by [[Britt Wadner]] of Swedish offshore station [[Radio Syd]], which was off the air because of pack ice in the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref name="Henry/von Joel" /&gt; The ''Cheeta II'' was equipped for FM broadcasting, so it was fitted with the 10&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter from the ''Mi Amigo'', feeding a makeshift antenna. The resulting signal was low-powered, but ensured that Caroline South's advertising revenue would continue.

The ''Mi Amigo'' returned to its Frinton-on-Sea anchorage with a redesigned antenna and a new 50&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter and attempted to resume broadcasting on 18 April, nominally on 259 metres to enable the same jingles as Radio Caroline North on 1169&amp;nbsp;kHz to be used, but actually 252 metres. The transmitter was initially too powerful for the antenna insulators. On 27 April, the ''Mi Amigo'' was fully operational.

Radio Caroline South's 259 metres signal was now near those of [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]] on 266m (1133&amp;nbsp;kHz) and the [[BBC Light Programme|BBC's Light Programme]] on 247m (1214&amp;nbsp;kHz). Radio Caroline North subsequently moved to 257m (1169&amp;nbsp;kHz) but also called it 259.

===Radio City affair===
In October 1965, negotiations began for Radio Caroline to take over [[Radio City (pirate radio station)|Radio City]], which broadcast from [[Shivering Sands Army Fort]], a Second World War [[Maunsell Sea Forts|marine fort]] off the [[Kent]]&lt;ref name="Henry/von Joel" /&gt; coast. One of Radio Caroline's directors, Major [[Oliver Smedley]], formerly of Radio Atlanta, entered a partnership with Radio City's owner, pop group manager [[Reginald Calvert]] and installed a more powerful transmitter on the fort. However, according to Gerry Bishop's book ''Offshore Radio'' this transmitter was antiquated and failed to work. Smedley later withdrew from the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 20 June 1966, Smedley boarded the Shivering Sands Fort with 10 workmen to repossess a transmitter that he had supplied, but had not been paid for. The next day, Calvert visited Smedley's home in Saffron Walden, Essex, to demand the departure of the raiders and the return of vital transmitter parts. During a violent struggle, Calvert was shot dead. Smedley's men occupied the fort until 22 June.&lt;ref name="Henry/von Joel" /&gt;

Smedley was charged with Calvert's murder on 18 July, but this was reduced to a charge of manslaughter. Smedley's trial opened on 11 October at Chemlsford Assizes, where the jury acquitted him.&lt;ref name="Henry/von Joel" /&gt;

In 1967, the UK Government enacted the [[Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967]], outlawing advertising on or supplying an unlicensed offshore radio station from the UK. In an earlier House of Commons debate (in June 1966), the government had claimed that the pirate ships were a danger because of radio frequency interference to emergency shipping channels, and to overseas radio stations and the pirates were paying no royalties to artists, composers or record companies. Furthermore, it was stated that the pirates' use of wavelengths also broke international agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1966/jun/22/wireless-and-television-pirate-stations |title=WIRELESS AND TELEVISION (PIRATE STATIONS) (Hansard, 22 June 1966) |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=1966-06-22 |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Manx parliament, the [[Tynwald]], attempted to exclude the North ship from the legislation, appealing to the European Court on the legality of the act being applied to the [[Isle of Man]]. Two ([[Radio 270]] and [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]]) of the remaining four UK based offshore stations closed, but the two Caroline ships continued with their supply operation moved to the [[Netherlands]], which did not outlaw unlicensed ship based broadcasting until 1974.

When Marine &amp;c. Broadcasting Offences Act become law on 14 August 1967, Radio Caroline was renamed Radio Caroline International. Six weeks later, the [[BBC]] introduced its new national pop station [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]], modelled largely on the successful offshore station [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]], and employed many of the ex-pirate DJs. The [[BBC Light Programme|BBC Light]], [[BBC Third Programme|Third]], and [[BBC Home Service|Home]] programmes became [[BBC Radio 2|Radios 2]], [[BBC Radio 3|3]] and [[BBC Radio 4|4]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/09/27/bvradio127.xml&amp;page=1 | work = Daily Telegraph | title = The day we woke up to pop music on Radio 1| date = 27 September 2007 | author = Imogen Carter | accessdate = 30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March 1968, the radio ships ''Mi Amigo'' and ''Caroline'', were boarded and seized before the day's broadcasting began. They were towed to Amsterdam by a salvage company to secure unpaid bills for servicing by the Dutch tender company [[Wijsmuller Transport]]&lt;ref name="Henry/von Joel" /&gt;

Because of the rise of land based pirate stations after the MOA became law - Usually stations run from bedrooms or outdoor sheds with small wattage transmitters - At least two stations broadcast using the Caroline name, one based in Dublin. These broadcasts took place between 1970 and 1973. &lt;ref&gt;http://dxarchive.com/ireland_a_to_z_irish_pirates_radio_caroline_dublin_1970.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 March 1970, a radio ship named {{MV|Mebo II||2}} anchored off the east coast of England during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|UK general election]] campaign, broadcasting as [[Radio North Sea International]] (RNI). RNI operated on medium wave, short wave and FM. Its medium wave transmission was [[Radio jamming|jammed]] by the UK authorities and on 13 June, RNI changed its name to Radio Caroline International with co-operation from Ronan O'Rahilly. Radio Caroline lobbied against the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and for the introduction of licensed commercial radio in the United Kingdom. Following the election, RNI resumed its original name but jamming continued under the newly elected Conservative government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk/#history_part_4.html|title=Caroline continues alone, is overwhelmed by difficulties but returns to punish the politicians|publisher=Radiocaroline.co.uk|accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until RNI returned to its original anchorage off the Netherlands that the jamming ceased.

In 1972, MV ''Mi Amigo'' was bought for her scrap value at auction by enthusiast Gerard van Dam, who intended to use her as a free radio museum. O'Rahilly promised financial backing if van Dam could return the ship to broadcasting condition.&lt;ref name="Noakes"&gt;{{cite book
|title = Last Of The Pirates: A saga of everyday life on board Radio Caroline
|author = Noakes, Bob
|publisher = Paul Harris Publishing
|place = Edinburgh
|year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship anchored off the Dutch coastal resort of [[Scheveningen]] and was serviced and operated from [[the Netherlands]]. That autumn various tests, consisting of continuous music, were made on 259 metres. The station restarted just before Christmas as Radio 199 but soon became Radio Caroline with a Top 40 format. DJs Chris Cary, broadcasting as [[Spangles Muldoon]] (who was also station manager), [[Roger Day|Roger 'Twiggy' Day]], Andy Archer, [[Paul Rusling|Paul Alexander]], [[Steve England]], Johnny Jason and Peter Chicago (real name Peter Murtha)&lt;ref name="Noakes" /&gt; manned the station.

In late 1972, Radio Caroline had money problems. On 28 December, unpaid crew cut the ''Mi Amigo'''s generator fuel line and departed. Later that day, the Dutch Royal Navy returned the crew and fighting broke out on board. Two days later, ''Mi Amigo'' was towed to [[IJmuiden]] and seized because of unpaid bills.&lt;ref name="Henry/von Joel" /&gt; Because of the Christmas holidays, no solicitors were available to issue a writ and the ship lay in Amsterdam harbour until O'Rahilly arranged for it to be towed back to sea. The ship was further delayed by hull damage and repaired before writs could be issued.&lt;ref name="Noakes" /&gt;

Between 11 and 20 April 1973, the ship broadcast for Radio Veronica while its ship, the ''[[MV Norderney|Norderney]]'', was aground. Because of a law that allows pirates in distress to come ashore without arrest, the running aground had no consequences for the crew.&lt;ref name="Henry/von Joel" /&gt; During summer 1973, it broadcast separate stations in English and Dutch simultaneously, on 389 m / 773 kHz and 252 m (announced as 259) / 1187&amp;nbsp;kHz. Two aerials and twin transmitters were used for about six weeks until the aerial mast failed. To accommodate the second aerial, a second short mast, just in front of the bridge, was employed as the other end for the main mast.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}

===Radio Atlantis and Radio Seagull===
{{main article|Radio Atlantis}}
Around this time, O'Rahilly decided Caroline should adopt an album format similar to [[progressive rock (radio format)|FM progressive rock]] stations in the USA, an audience not catered for in Europe. This service was Radio Seagull and broadcast live during the evening.

Since Radio Caroline could not find enough advertising, it shared its nominal 259 metre wavelength, actually 1187&amp;nbsp;kHz or 253 metres, with Dutch-language pop stations. The first was a Belgian station called [[Radio Atlantis]], owned by Belgian businessman Adriaan van Landschoot. Programmes were recorded on land and broadcast between 6{{nbsp}}am and 7{{nbsp}}pm. Rough weather sometimes prevented tapes from arriving and old programmes had to be repeated. Later in 1973, when the contract with Radio Caroline ended, the crew of Radio Atlantis moved to their own ship, the {{MV|Jeanine}}.&lt;ref name="Henry/von Joel" /&gt;

Radio Seagull became Radio Caroline on 23 February 1974, retaining the album format. Throughout most of the 1970s, Radio Caroline could be heard only at night, calling itself "Europe's first and only album station".

===Radio Mi Amigo===
Another Belgian station, '''Radio Mi Amigo''', launched on 1 January 1974; it was run by Belgian businessman and [[Waffle|Suzy Waffles]] owner [[Sylvain Tack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offshoreechos.com/Sylvain%20Tack.htm |title=Tribute to Sylvain Tack |publisher=Offshoreechos.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station's offices and studios were in [[Brakel]], Belgium, but moved to [[Castell-Platja d'Aro]], Costa Brava, Spain in March 1975 after a raid by Belgian police. Here they produced programmes for Dutch-speaking holidaymakers, mostly [[Europop]], [[Top 40]], [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] and Dutch language popular music presented by Belgian, Dutch and occasionally English DJs with frequent commercials. Because commercial radio was prohibited in Belgium, Radio Mi Amigo had little competition from the former BRT State Radio and TV (today VRT Flemisch State radio and TV) and became very popular in Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK. For the first years, advertising on the station was in demand. When [[Radio Veronica]] closed in 1974, some presenters moved to Radio Mi Amigo.

===Loving Awareness===
Caroline's album format meant that, although the station served a gap in the market, its audience was smaller than in the 1960s. Caroline also promoted O'Rahilly's concept of ''Loving Awareness'' (LA), a far-eastern philosophy of love and peace. Some DJs were embarrassed but some were fascinated by the challenge of an abstract concept. Disc jockey [[Tony Allan]] developed a following, combining Loving Awareness with a professional style, humanity, knowledge of music and rich radio voice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1974, O'Rahilly set up a pop group called The Loving Awareness Band, comprising [[John Turnbull (musician)|John Turnbull]] (guitar) and [[Mick Gallagher]] (keyboards) both formerly of [[Skip Bifferty]] and two session musicians, [[Norman Watt-Roy]] (bass) and Charlie Charles (drums). In 1976, The Loving Awareness Band released their only album, ''Loving Awareness'' on More Love Records (ML001), a label set up by O'Rahilly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popgeekheaven.com/music-discovery/lost-treasures-loving-awareness|title=Lost Treasures – Loving Awareness|last=Marston|first=Peter|date=17 June 2014|website=Pop Geek Heaven|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was reissued on CD on Ross Records, c.1992, and in a "30th Anniversary Edition" with bonus material on SMC Records in 2005. The band broke up in 1977; Watt-Roy and Charles played on [[Ian Dury]]'s ''[[New Boots and Panties!!]]'' album, and Turnbull and Gallagher joined them on the [[Stiff Records|Stiff]]'s tour, becoming [[The Blockheads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic | class = artist | id = p19030 | tab = biography | label = Biography of Loving Awareness | first = Bruce | last = Eder | accessdate = 18 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch legislation===
The Dutch government banned unlicensed offshore radio on 1 September 1974. Radio Caroline continued, moving its headquarters and servicing operation to Spain. ''Mi Amigo'' moved from the Dutch coast to the [[Knock Deep Channel]], approximately {{Convert|12|mi|km|0}} from the British coast. After 31 August, shows for Radio Mi Amigo were delivered on [[compact cassette|cassettes]] rather than [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tapes. Beginning in 1975, the cassettes were transported from [[Platja d'Aro|Playa d'Aro]] on the Europa Bus service, which carried people from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Madrid]] at low prices. The tapes were picked up in Belgium at a bus stop, taken to a small sports plane and dropped in the sea close to the radio ship. The Mi Amigo "Top 50" tapes were flown over by helicopter to get them on board more quickly.

On 1 September, a small motor launch had difficulties in rough seas. Radio Caroline broadcast appeals for help, giving the ship's position as {{coord|51|41|N|1|35|E}}. A coastguard vessel escorted the launch back to shore, but the authorities were unhappy that Caroline listeners had jammed the emergency switchboards.

The ''Mi Amigo'' was tendered clandestinely from Britain, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Tenders and boat owners were warned, and some were prosecuted for ferrying staff and provisions to the ship. Belgium had outlawed offshore radio in 1962 and prosecuted advertisers, cutting the station's revenue. Belgian courts sentenced Tack and some DJs to fines and jail ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'', although the prison terms were later cancelled.

===Wavelength changes===
The two stations experimented with different frequencies. After a short test on 773&amp;nbsp;kHz in late 1975, in May 1976, Radio Caroline began a daytime service on 1562&amp;nbsp;kHz (192 m) using a 10&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter, while its overnight service continued to share the 50&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter with Radio Mi Amigo's daytime programming on 1187&amp;nbsp;kHz (253 metres, announced as 259).

In December 1976, Radio Mi Amigo moved to 1562&amp;nbsp;kHz on the 50&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter, leaving Caroline on 1187&amp;nbsp;kHz 24 hours a day on the 10&amp;nbsp;kW. Radio Caroline had greater night-time interference, and it was decided to move Caroline to a new frequency. On 3 March 1977, Caroline closed, announcing that it would return six days later on 319 metres. To allow Radio Mi Amigo to continue broadcasting by day, the engineering work for Caroline's move had to be carried out over six nights, after the 50&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter was switched off.

Caroline returned on 9 March 1977 on 953&amp;nbsp;kHz, actually 315 metres but announced as 319. This gave reasonable reception by day but strong [[heterodyne]] interference at night because the transmitter crystal was off-channel. In July Caroline moved to the adjacent channel, 962&amp;nbsp;kHz (312 metres but still called 319) and reception in the UK improved. Meanwhile, Radio Mi Amigo had interference on 1562&amp;nbsp;kHz and changed to 1412&amp;nbsp;kHz (212 m).

Finally, Radio Mi Amigo moved to 962&amp;nbsp;kHz on 1 December. Due to generator trouble, the two services could no longer be broadcast simultaneously and Radio Caroline again broadcast at night with both stations using the 50&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter and Radio Caroline began to receive more mail from the continent. At times, a 10&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter was used to save fuel and relieve the generators. The 10&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters could run on the Henschel generator beside the two main MAN units and also a Cummins unit on the aft deck behind the wheelhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roundsandsounds.co.uk |title=This site is put together by Johnny Lewis, an engineer and presenter who worked on the station at the time |publisher=Roundsandsounds.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1977, Radio Caroline began sponsored evangelical programmes, and music programmes began at 9{{nbsp}}pm. On 20 October 1978, technical and financial problems put the ''Mi Amigo'' off the air. Unhappy at the loss of advertising, Radio Mi Amigo terminated its contract with Caroline in November 1978 and broadcast from its own ship, the [[MV Magdalena|MV ''Magdalena'']] later that year, but this was short-lived. Broadcasting was in Dutch and English by day and in English at night, although for the first few months broadcasting finished at 10{{nbsp}}pm. On 19 January 1979, the ageing ship took in water and a lifeboat was called to rescue the crew members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/seventy.htm |title=The Pirate Radio Hall of Fame: the seventies |publisher=Offshoreradio.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio Caroline returned to the air on 15 April 1979. The first record played was ''[[Fool (If You Think It's Over)]]'', by [[Chris Rea]], dedicated to the British [[Home Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offshoreechos.com/offshorethemes/stations%20a-d.htm |title=STATIONS 1 |publisher=Offshoreechos.com |date=20 April 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period each night transmission of Radio Caroline started with ''Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft'' by the progressive Rock Band [[Klaatu (band)|Klaatu]], issued in 1976 on their album [[3:47 EST|3:47 E.S.T]].

===''Mi Amigo'' sinks===
{{main article|MV Mi Amigo}}

Just after midnight GMT on 20 March 1980, the ''Mi Amigo'' foundered in a storm after losing its anchor and drifting. It began taking in water and the crew was rescued by lifeboat.&lt;ref name="Henry/von Joel" /&gt; The generator was left running but the pumps could not manage and the vessel sank 10 minutes later. Three British nationals, a Dutchman and their canary (named Wilson after the former Labour Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]]) were rescued. The last broadcast from the ''Mi Amigo'' was by Stevie Gordon and Tom Anderson:&lt;ref&gt;http://images.45cat.com/the-one-shots-caroline-jingles-jumbo.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|('''Gordon'''): Well, we're sorry to tell you that due to the severe weather conditions and the fact that we are shipping quite a lot of water, we are closing down, and the crew are at this stage leaving the ship. Obviously, we hope to be back with you as soon as possible, but just for the moment we would like to say goodbye. 
('''Anderson'''): It's not a very good occasion really, we have to hurry this because the lifeboat is standing by. We're not leaving and disappearing, we're going onto the lifeboat hoping that the pumps can take it; if they can, we'll be back, if not, well, we really don't like to say it. 
('''Gordon'''): I think we'll be back in one way or another. 
('''Anderson'''): Yeah. I think so. 
('''Gordon'''): For the moment from all of us, goodbye and God bless.}}

The crew of the [[Sheerness]] lifeboat ''Helen Turnbull'' were commended for the rescue of broadcasters Tom Anderson, Stevie Gordon, Nick Richards and Hans Verlaan from ''Mi Amigo'' while it was sinking in the Black Deep near Long Sand Bank. Having to manoeuvre the lifeboat alongside the stricken vessel 13 times in high seas and a north-easterly gale earned Coxswain Charles Bowry an [[RNLI]] silver medal. Each of his crew was awarded ''The Thanks of the Institution'' on vellum.&lt;ref name="Sheerness"&gt;{{cite web

===MV ''Ross Revenge''===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
The station restarted in August 1983 from a new radio ship, the [[MV Ross Revenge|MV ''Ross Revenge'']], an ex-[[North Sea]] factory [[Commercial trawler|fishing trawler]] used during the [[United Kingdom|Anglo]]-[[Iceland]]ic [[Cod War]] by [[Ross Fisheries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/humberside/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8924000/8924470.stm |title=Appeal for memories of the Grimsby trawler Ross Revenge |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had an antenna system radiating from a {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} high mast, the tallest on any ship in the world. It left Spain, with an incomplete studio, to avoid legal entanglements. Radio Caroline began to broadcast from the ship on 19 August 1983, with unwanted mechanical sounds on speech. The station was opened by DJ Tom Anderson, who had said "goodbye" from the sinking ''Mi Amigo'' in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/DATABASES/CAR/car04.shtml |title=The wet and wild history of Radio Caroline (4) |publisher=Icce.rug.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ross Revenge'' was larger than ''Mi Amigo'' and with more elaborate transmitting equipment: in 1983, two 5&amp;nbsp;kW RCA transmitters and a RCA 50&amp;nbsp;kW unit. One 5&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter was initially not serviceable. When Radio Monique hired the main transmitter, spare parts were taken from a fourth transmitter to convert the 5&amp;nbsp;kW into a 10&amp;nbsp;kW unit, the RCA 5 and 10&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters having similar designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eylard.nl/OffShoreRadio/Caroline/index.htm |title=Photos of the transmitters can be found here |publisher=Eylard.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining 5&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter was later converted for short wave use.

O'Rahilly wanted Radio Caroline to become an [[oldies]] station. He was opposed by some DJs and crew who had worked on the ''Mi Amigo'' and the album format stayed along with presenters such as [[Andy Archer (radio presenter)|Andy Archer]], [[Samantha Dubois]], [[Grant Benson]], Robin Ross and Simon Barrett. Officially, Radio Caroline was managed from offices in North America, with advertising from the US and Canada. In practice, day-to-day servicing was carried from France and the UK.

From the anchorage in the Knock Deep the ''Mi Amigo'''s mast could be seen on the horizon. Four studios were on board, enabling other services. Radio Caroline tried several frequencies, among them 963, 576, 585 (briefly), 558 (after [[Laser 558]] closed) and later 819&amp;nbsp;kHz. European medium wave channels had been reallocated to multiples of nine. In the evenings on 963, some alternative music programmes were tried, including the [[reggae]] "Jamming 963", and in 1986 and early 1987, a progressive and indie rock programme called [[Caroline Overdrive]] hosted by Kevin Turner, Mark Matthews, Peter Phillips, Mick Williams (a.k.a. Ray Clark) and Rob Charles.

On 9 August 1985, an official vessel anchored 150 yards from the ''Ross Revenge''. The UK [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI) put a permanent watch on movements around the ''Ross Revenge'' and the MV ''Communicator'', Laser 558{{'}}s ship. On 3 September 1985 at 24:00 hours the ''[[Dioptric Surveyor]]'' departed in a storm.

===Radio Monique===
{{main article|Radio Monique}}
From December 1984 the ''Ross Revenge'' broadcast ''Radio Monique'', recorded and live Dutch-language programmes of a Dutch music radio production company using the 50&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter during daytime. They were pop and Europop aimed at the mainstream Dutch audience. Radio Monique was popular throughout [[Benelux]].

In the evenings, Radio Caroline transmitted Dutch and American religious [[Evangelism|evangelist]] broadcasters such as [[Johan Maasbach]] and [[Roy Masters (commentator)|Roy Masters]] on medium wave, and later on short wave, under the name ''Viewpoint 963/819'', or ''World Mission Radio (WMR)'' on short wave.

In November 1985, the competing offshore station, Laser 558, closed after electrical problems and Caroline moved from 576&amp;nbsp;kHz to Laser's 558&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency, with a [[Top 40]] music format similar to Laser's under the name Caroline 558. When Laser returned as Laser Hot Hits, it used Caroline's former and inferior frequency of 576&amp;nbsp;kHz.

===The mast collapses===
In 1987, the [[List of Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom Parliament, 1980-1999|Territorial Sea Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&amp;PageNumber=37&amp;NavFrom=2&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1323295&amp;activetextdocid=1323297 |title=Territorial Sea Act 1987 |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; extended the UK maritime limit from three to 12 nautical miles (22&amp;nbsp;km). To remain in international waters, the ship moved to a new, less-sheltered anchorage. Initially this was a minor inconvenience as the {{convert|300|ft|m|sing=on}} mast was thought sturdy enough. However, in October 1987 a [[Great Storm of 1987|massive storm]] hit southern England, causing deaths and severe damage. MV ''Ross Revenge'' weathered the storm in the North Sea.

The following day, Caroline was one of few stations in the South East still broadcasting. However, the storm had weakened the mast, which collapsed in another storm later. Caroline returned to the air using a makeshift aerial with a less powerful signal. This was replaced by a twin-mast T-antenna. For several months only one transmitter could be used, leading to the loss of the income-generating Radio Monique, although a substitute Dutch daytime service, Radio 558 (later Radio 819), was eventually established.

===1989 Anglo-Dutch raid===
During mid-August 1989, authorities in several European countries carried out co-ordinated raids on houses, recording studios and offices believed to be used by Caroline. On 18 August, a British government chartered ship pulled up alongside the ''Ross Revenge'' and asked to board to "discuss the future" of the ''Ross Revenge'' and the stations operating from it. This request, and one to stop transmissions on 819&amp;nbsp;kHz, was refused. A request to stop broadcasting on short wave 6215&amp;nbsp;kHz was complied with, and after several hours the government ship returned to port.

The following day James Murphy, an investigator for the UK Office of the [[Official Solicitor]], acting for the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]], joined colleagues and counterparts from the [[Netherlands Radio Regulatory Authority]] to execute an armed raid on the ''Ross Revenge'' in which equipment was damaged or confiscated.

Part of the raid was broadcast live&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dxradio.co.uk/audio/Caroline_558_19aug1989.mp3|title = Dxradio|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; before officials disabled the transmitters. Dutch nationals were arrested and returned to the Netherlands, together with most of the broadcasting equipment. Non-Dutch staff were given the option of staying on the ship or returning to the Netherlands – most chose to stay on board. Caroline claimed boarding the ship and removal or destruction of equipment was [[piracy]]. The Dutch claimed the ship's Panamanian registration had lapsed in 1987 and it was not under legal protection from any country and that its transmissions breached international regulations which since 1982 had prohibited broadcasting from outside national territories. Several years later some of the seized items were returned to the station.

In 1990 the UK government amended the 1967 anti-offshore law to allow the boarding and silencing of stations in international waters if their signals could be received in the UK, even if their vessels were foreign registered and operated. [[Noel Annan, Baron Annan|Lord Annan]], author of the 1977 [[Annan Committee|Report of the Committee on the Future of Broadcasting]], spoke in defence of Radio Caroline in the House of Lords at report stage on the [[Broadcasting Act 1990]], saying "Why break a butterfly upon the wheel?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1990/jun/05/broadcasting-bill#column_1257 |title=Hansard 5 June 1990 |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1995 article for the pressure group [[Charter88]], Steve McGann commented: &lt;blockquote&gt; "Whether Caroline was right to maintain her defiance for so many years is irrelevant. Her story illustrates how uniquely dangerous government regards an independent voice transmitted over unrestricted airwaves and to what ends it will go to silence it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/charter88archive/pubs/other/mcgann.html |title=The Real story of Radio Caroline |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716163420/http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/charter88archive/pubs/other/mcgann.html |archivedate=16 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; This legislation remains in force.

===1990–1991: After the raid===
On 1 October 1989, Radio Caroline restarted broadcasting from the ''Ross Revenge'' using makeshift equipment and low power, to retain the 558&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency. Engineer Peter Chicago had hidden transmitter parts during the raid and retuned one 5&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter, previously used on short-wave, to 558&amp;nbsp;kHz. Over the following months, Caroline's signal quality improved as transmitting [[Vacuum tube|valves]] were donated and programming returned to normal.

In June 1990, [[Spectrum Radio]], a new multi-ethnic [[community radio]] station in London, was officially allocated 558&amp;nbsp;kHz. Caroline caused more interference to Spectrum than vice versa. Caroline broadcast regular apologies to Spectrum listeners but refused to vacate the channel. Spectrum threatened to sue the [[Radio Authority]], which then allowed Spectrum to temporarily broadcast on 990&amp;nbsp;kHz alongside 558&amp;nbsp;kHz. Eventually, Caroline left 558&amp;nbsp;kHz and moved to 819&amp;nbsp;kHz. On 5 November 1990, lack of fuel and supplies forced the station to cease. The final song was ''[[Pilot of the Airwaves]]'' by [[Charlie Dore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.offshoreechos.com/offshorethemes/1st%20&amp;%20Last%20A-L.htm |title=First &amp; last |publisher=Offshoreechos.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206115136/http://www.offshoreechos.com/offshorethemes/1st%20%26%20Last%20A-L.htm |archivedate=6 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most broadcasting staff left at that time, some remained for a year as caretakers while funding and equipment were sought.  The station tried to obtain a licence from a developing country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sasradiogroup.org/caroline-movement |title=Caroline Movement |publisher=sasradiogroup |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; hoping it might offer protection from the new provisions in the 1990 [[Broadcasting Act 1990|Broadcasting Act]] which came into force on 31 December that year.

In November 1991, the ship lost its anchor in a storm and drifted on to the [[Goodwin Sands]] in the Channel. The crew was rescued by a [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] helicopter. The ''Ross Revenge'' was salvaged and brought into harbour in Dover, ending 27 years of Radio Caroline's unlicensed offshore career.

==1991–present: Licensed Support Group era==
Since 1991, the ''Ross Revenge'' has been maintained by enthusiasts called the ''Radio Caroline Support Group'', originally the ''Ross Revenge Support Group''. From 2007, the ship was docked at [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury]], where a volunteer crew repaired and maintained it. The ship has working radio studios, from which both Caroline and [[BBC Essex]] have broadcast. On 31 July 2014 the ship was moved to the [[Blackwater Estuary]] in [[Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Radio Caroline |url=http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk/#ross_move_pics.html |title=The Ross Revenge Move Gallery |publisher=Radiocaroline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former offshore broadcasters who continue on the station are: Roger Mathews, [[Nigel MacArthur|Nigel Harris]], Martin Fisher, Marc Jacobs, Johnny Lewis, Doug Wood, Dave Foster, Cliff Osbourne, [[Chris Pearson (radio)|Chris Pearson]], Bob Lawrence, Jeremy Chartham and Ad Roberts.  Evangelical programmes and sponsored specialist music are broadcast. During Easter 2008, the station broadcast live for three days from the Ross Revenge, featuring presenters who had worked on the Mi Amigo in the late 1970s: Roger Mathews, Mike Stevens, Bob Lawrence, Brian Martin, Martin Fisher, Cliff Osbourne, Jeremy Chartham, Marc Jacobs, Ad Roberts, Dick Verheul and Kees Borrell.

===Restricted service licences===
Radio Caroline was off the air for most of the 1990s, except for occasional low-power broadcasts of one month. Some of these licensed 28-day [[Restricted Service Licence|restricted service licence]] (RSL) broadcasts took place from the ''Ross Revenge'' during the 1990s, with the ship anchored off Clacton, in London's [[Canary Wharf]], [[Southend Pier]] and off the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in [[Kent]].

On 1 October 2001 at one minute past midnight, Caroline returned on 1503&amp;nbsp;kHz from the LV (Light Vessel) 18 in Harwich harbour. This two-day broadcast featured Phil Mitchell, Paul Dennis, Colin Lamb, John Patrick, Barry James, Steve Cisco and Clive Boutell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Martin van der Ven |url=http://www.radiocaroline.de/platt2.htm |title=Radio Caroline: Into the new millennium |publisher=Radiocaroline.de |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LV 18 would later be used by the BBC for BBC Pirate Radio Essex broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/essex/pirate/exhibition.shtml |title=Pirate BBC Essex |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another RSL broadcast ran from 7 August until 3 September 2004, with the ship moored at the cruise liner terminal jetty at Tilbury in [[Essex]]. It commemorated the 40th anniversary of Radio Caroline and promoted the station's legal internet and satellite programmes. The medium wave frequency was 235 metres (1278&amp;nbsp;kHz) and programmes were sent through [[ISDN]] landline to [[Maidstone]] and via the internet and broadcast on satellite. The supermarket chain [[Asda]] and [[English Heritage]] were among the backers.

The station has subsequently broadcast on 531&amp;nbsp;kHz AM from the ''Ross Revenge'' during some [[bank holiday]] weekends, beginning on 28–31 August 2009 and also within a few days of the 50th anniversary of the ship's first voyage.

===Satellite and internet broadcasting===
Using land-based studios leased in [[Kent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maidstonestudios.com/ |title=Home &amp;#124; The Maistone Television Studios |publisher=Maidstonestudios.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1990s, the station began broadcasting via satellites [[Astra 19.2°E]] and [[Eutelsat 28A]], covering [[western Europe]]. These analogue transmissions ended and a full digital service from [[Astra 28.2°E]] started in February 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk/#history_part_14.html|title=Bringing Caroline into the new millennium|publisher=Radiocaroline.co.uk|accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Caroline began on [[1worldspace|WorldSpace]] satellite radio, continuing until Worldspace went bankrupt and re-organised its operations in 2008. On 12 June 2006, the station bought an [[Electronic program guide|EPG]] slot on [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] channel 0199.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.rnw.nl/medianetwork/radio-caroline-finally-appears-on-sky-epg|title=Radio Caroline finally appears on Sky EPG|publisher=Media Network|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ended on 1 July 2011 after a failure to renegotiate costs with Sky and deciding not pursue a [[Freesat]] EPG slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.rnw.nl/medianetwork/radio-caroline-decides-to-get-rid-of-its-epg-slot|title=Radio Caroline decides to get rid of its EPG slot|publisher=Media Network|date=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys in 2008 and 2010 showed a small percentage listened via Sky, and that satellite listening had dropped by 9% since 2008, while online listening had increased by around 40%. Radio Caroline continued on satellite but required manual tuning.

During 2013, a survey showed a continued move from satellite reception and growth in internet listening.  Following negotiations with the service provider, satellite transmissions ended at midnight on 30 September 2013. Programmes were still heard on satellite until the provider replaced the signal with a 1&amp;nbsp;kHz tone on the morning of 1 October 2013.  Internet streaming of Radio Caroline programmes continued.

The Radio Caroline "album" station has been streamed on the internet for many years, accessible via the station's website, with more streams on various devices.&lt;ref name="Radio Caroline Streams Guide"/&gt;  Dedicated apps for listening via Apple IOS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/caroline/id396905232|title=Radio Caroline App for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch on iTunes Store}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Android&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk/#android_app.html|title=Radio Caroline Android App|publisher=Radiocaroline.co.uk|accessdate=2014-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; devices are also available. In 2011 Radio Caroline joined Radioplayer UK, an internet service formed by the BBC, [[Global Radio]] and the [[Guardian Media Group]] that supplies a live feed of UK radio stations to across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioplayer.co.uk/index.php/about/ |title=Radioplayer UK – About |publisher=Radioplayer.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724053148/http://www.radioplayer.co.uk/index.php/about/ |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 4 May 2015, Radio Caroline has a 24-hour "Flashback" webstream&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Radio Caroline|url = http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk/#home.html|website = www.radiocaroline.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; carrying "oldies" music and jingles.

===Via Manx Radio===
Since September 2015, Radio Caroline has been broadcasting 'live' for one weekend each month&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rayradio.co.uk/home/4562773082|title=rayradio.co.uk|website=www.rayradio.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "Radio Caroline North" (with original DJs and a mixed sixties, seventies and eighties music content and jingles) from its former home the [[MV Ross Revenge|MV ''Ross Revenge'']] on the [[Blackwater Estuary]] in Essex, via [[Manx Radio]]'s 1368&amp;nbsp;kHz 20kW transmitter on the Isle of Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio Caroline North and Manx Radio|url=http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk/manx_info.html|website=Radio Caroline|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio Caroline at 50 years (1964–2014)===
From 31 March to 27 April 2014, a ''Caroline North'' tribute station, based on the Planet Lightship berthed in the Albert Dock complex on Liverpool's waterfront, broadcast locally on 87.7FM and on the internet.  Programmes were presented by current and former DJs from the BBC, ILR, Ireland, Luxembourg, offshore and land-based pirate stations, and other international and freelance backgrounds, including Tony Prince and Emperor Rosko.  Original 1960s Caroline North jingles were interspersed with generic Radio Caroline ones.  The station played a wide selection of music from when Caroline started in the 1960s, but also included music from the 70s and 80s and early 90s to widen the audience profile.  The four-week event was funded through on-air local business commercials.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Medium wave campaign===
In December 2010, Chatham and Aylesford MP [[Tracey Crouch]] presented an [[Early Day Motion]] to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] calling for [[Ofcom]] to allow Radio Caroline to broadcast as a licensed medium wave station to its "traditional heartland of the south east".

The full text of the EDM is:&lt;blockquote&gt; That this House expresses its disappointment that, having pioneered commercial radio in the UK and for the past decade being a fully licensed broadcaster, Radio Caroline, a cornerstone of British radio history, has been denied by OFCOM the opportunity to secure a medium wave frequency from which to broadcast; regrets that as a result its devoted listeners are confined to listening to Radio Caroline via the internet and unable to enjoy its musical offerings in transit; and calls on OFCOM to exhaust all avenues in making the provisions available for Radio Caroline to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2014 by broadcasting on a medium wave frequency which, it appears, is unwanted by both BBC and commercial operators as a broadcast platform."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2010-12/1163 Early day motion 1163]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In May 2017, Ofcom awarded the station a community licence to broadcast to Suffolk and north Essex on 648&amp;nbsp;kHz with a power of 1&amp;nbsp;kW.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AM Plans|url=http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk/#am_plans.html|website=Radio Caroline|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 November 2017, test transmissions commenced from an omni-directional mast (formerly used by the [[BBC World Service]]) at [[Orfordness transmitting station|Orford Ness]], Suffolk.

Commercial programming commenced at noon on Friday 22 December 2017, with a signal that could be heard as far afield as Southampton, Birmingham and Glasgow.

==International operations==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}

===The Netherlands===
In January 2002, a Dutch Caroline fan called Sietse Brouwer launched a Netherlands-based Radio Caroline in [[Harlingen, Netherlands|Harlingen]], broadcasting on the northern Netherlands cable networks and largely independent of UK Caroline. Brouwer intended to obtain an AM frequency from the Netherlands authorities in 2003 when its medium wave frequencies were reallocated. However, Dutch Caroline failed to secure a high power AM frequency and the cable network service was discontinued because of lack of funds. The Dutch Radio Caroline then changed its name to [[:nl:Radio Waddenzee|Radio Waddenzee]] for daytime Dutch and German language, and Radio Seagull for nighttime English language broadcasts, and now broadcasts on 1602&amp;nbsp;kHz every day and on the internet, presenting a progressive rock format. From November 2009, Radio Seagull can be heard periodically on 558&amp;nbsp;kHz in London.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Spain===
In Spain, a station broadcast during the summer 2009 on 102.7&amp;nbsp;MHz in the Costa Blanca from studios in Benidorm. The station had some success but stopped broadcasting due to lack of funding. Broadcasters included Tony Christian, Pawl "Hound Dog" Shanley, Dave Fox, Simon West, Dale Richardson and Peter D.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

===Ireland===
Radio Caroline is broadcast in the Republic of Ireland on channel 927 on the [[UPC Ireland]] [[Cable television|cable]] service in the main cities of [[Dublin]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Galway]], [[Waterford]] and Cappoquin, and the County Waterford towns of Lismore and Tallow.

===New Zealand===
{{see also|Radio Caroline New Zealand}}
In [[Timaru]], an [[NZBC]] station, originally 3XC, later 3ZC, broadcast as Radio Caroline until 1995.  The name was taken from [[Timaru|Caroline Bay]], a popular recreation area nearby.&lt;ref name="Tiramu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theradiovault.net/timaru.htm |title=Timaru |publisher=Theradiovault.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Palmerston, New Zealand|Palmerston]], Radio Caroline International, based in Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain, acquired an AM commercial broadcasting licence in 2008, and was seeking wavelengths in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. Daytime programming was leased to a community radio service called Puketapu Radio on 756&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="Puketapu"&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Republic of Stakhanov''' was a proposed separatist republic of Pavel Dryomov on the territory of the city of [[Stakhanov, Ukraine|Stakhanov]] within the separatist [[Luhansk People's Republic]].&lt;ref name="Cossack Separatist Republics"&gt;[https://medium.com/@Hromadske/a-guide-to-warlords-of-the-ukraine-separatist-republics-2be78dfc7a5e   Cossack Separatist Republics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the war Dryomov was a bricklayer in Stakhanov.&lt;ref name="Cossack Separatist Republics"/&gt; At the beginning of the [[War in Donbass|conflict in Eastern Ukraine]], Dryomov offered Stakhanov citizens an alternate vision to that of the LPR - a new, [[socialist]] neo-[[Soviet]], "Cossack" republic "that works for the poor and elderly". In 2014 Dryomov was called the "savior of Stakhanov" by the British journalist [[Oliver Carroll]] who wrote an article about him in [[Politico]] magazine.&lt;ref name="politico.com"&gt;http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/11/welcome-to-the-cossack-peoples-republic-of-stakhanov-112420&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carroll, one of the main points of departure between The Republic of Stakahnov and the [[Luhansk People's Republic]] was whether to adhere to the [[Minsk Protocol]] ceasefire deal with [[Ukraine]]. Dryomov advocated continuing the [[War in Donbass]]. During a speech, he advocated his views and stated  "We've had enough corruption and slavery here for a century! We're not fools—neither Poroshenko nor Putin are interested in an honest country!" Nothing would be allowed to get in the way of destiny, he declared: "We will build a Cossack republic right here in Stakhanov!"&lt;ref name="politico.com"/&gt;

According to some sources, on September 14, 2014, [[Don Cossacks]] in [[Stakhanov, Ukraine]] proclaimed the Republic of Stakhanov, and that a "Cossack government" now ruled in Stakhanov.&lt;ref name="OSCE17SEPT"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/123628 | title=Latest from OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine based on information received as of 18:00 (Kyiv time), 15 September 2014 | publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe | date=16 September 2014 | accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OSCE17SEPT" /&gt;  However, the following day, this was claimed to be a fabrication, and an unnamed Don Cossack leader stated the September 14 meeting had, in fact, resulted in 12,000 Cossacks volunteering to join the LPR forces.&lt;ref name="OSCE18SEPT"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osce.org/ukraine-smm/123746 | title=Latest from OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine based on information received as of 18:00 (Kyiv time), 18 September 2014 | publisher=Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe | date=18 September 2014 | accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pavel Dryomov died on 12 December 2015 when his car was blown up while he was traveling the day after his wedding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.mobi/a/ukraine-separatist-cossack-commander-killed/27422751.html Separatist Cossack Commander Reported Killed In Ukraine's Luhansk], [[Radio Free Europe]] (12 December 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
