      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9864">The '''1995 Okinawa rape incident''' took place on September 4, 1995, when three  [[Military of the United States|U.S. servicemen]]&amp;nbsp;– [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Seaman]] Marcus Gill and [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] Rodrico Harp and Kendrick Ledet, who were all serving at [[Camp Hansen, Okinawa JA|Camp Hansen]] on [[Okinawa]]&amp;nbsp;– rented a van and kidnapped a 12-year-old Japanese girl. They beat her, [[Duct tape|duct-taped]] her eyes and mouth shut, and bound her hands. Gill and Harp then [[rape]]d her, while Ledet claimed he only pretended to do so out of fear of Gill.&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Watanabe [http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-28/news/mn-62075_1_japanese-girl "Okinawa Rape Suspect's Lawyer Gives Dark Account : Japan: Attorney of accused Marine says co-defendant admitted assaulting 12-year-old girl 'just for fun'". ] ''Los Angeles Times'' October 28, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The incident led to further [[United States Forces Japan|debate over the continued presence of U.S. forces in Japan]]. The offenders were tried and convicted in Japanese court by Japanese law, in accordance with the [[U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement]]. The families of the defendants initially claimed that Japanese officials had racially discriminated against the men because they were all black and coerced confessions from them, but later retracted the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wife Pleads Marine's Case in Okinawa Rape Trial : Justice: Spouse says her husband, accused in brutal attack on schoolgirl, is a gentle and intelligent man|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-05/news/mn-10474_1_okinawa-schoolgirl|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=13 October 2013|date=December 5, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
After the incident became known, public outrage erupted, especially over the [[U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement]], which gives the U.S. service members a certain measure of [[extraterritoriality]] (exemption from jurisdiction of local law) only as it relates to the place the suspects were detained. While the crime was committed away from a U.S. [[military base]], the U.S. initially took the men into custody, on September 6.&lt;ref name="Amcharged"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/29/world/americans-charged-in-rape-in-okinawa.html Americans Charged In Rape in Okinawa]" [[The New York Times]]. September 29, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  Although false rumors spread that the suspects were free to roam the base and had been seen eating hamburgers,&lt;ref name="OKpact"&gt;Watanabe, Teresa. "[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-26/news/mn-61240_1_military-facilities U.S., Japan OK Pact on Military Crime Suspects]" ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' October 26, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; the suspects were in fact held in a military [[brig (prison)|brig]] until the Japanese officials charged them with the crime.&lt;ref name="Amcharged"/&gt;  Despite an immediate request by [[Law enforcement in Japan|Japanese law enforcement]] for custody and eventual trial, the men were only handed over on September 29, after the Japanese had formally indicted them.&lt;ref name="Amcharged"/&gt;  This delay followed the Status of Forces agreement, which states, "The custody of an accused member of the United States armed forces or the civilian component over whom Japan is to exercise jurisdiction shall, if he is in the hands of the United States, remain with the United States until he is charged."&lt;ref&gt;U.S.-Japan SOFA Agreement, Article xvii (5) (c):&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the military drove the suspects to police headquarters in Naha for daily interrogations,&lt;ref&gt;Adam B. Norman, The Rape Controversy: Is A Revision of the Status Forces Agreement with Japan Necessary?, 6 Ind. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. Rev. 717, 724 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; the SOFA provision and the delay in handing over the suspects increased the outrage over the attack, causing the largest [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] demonstrations in Okinawa since the treaty was signed in 1960.

As a consequence of the protests regarding jurisdiction, the U.S. made concessions and agreed to consider handing suspects over to the Japanese before an [[indictment]] if the severity of the alleged crime warranted it.&lt;ref name="OKpact"/&gt; This agreement was hashed out at an emergency meeting between [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Ryutaro Hashimoto]]. The people of Okinawa also placed a full-page ad in ''[[The New York Times]]'' decrying the rape and other aspects of the U.S. bases in Okinawa. In 1996, the United States and Japan signed a [[Bilateralism|bilateral]] agreement to reduce the amount of land on Okinawa covered by U.S. bases by 21 percent&amp;mdash;the U.S. military had previously occupied 19 percent of the island.

U.S. Navy [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Richard C. Macke]] was the commander of [[United States Pacific Command]] at the time of the attack. At a press conference in November 1995, Macke said of the men's actions: "I think it was absolutely stupid. I have said several times: for the price they paid to rent the car [used in the crime], they could have had a girl &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Prostitution in Japan|prostitute]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;." These remarks were condemned as insensitive, and Macke was removed from his post and forced into [[early retirement]]. He was also [[Reduction in rank|reduced in rank]] to [[rear admiral]] (two-star) from full admiral (four-star), which reduced his [[pension]] from US$7,384/month to US$5,903/month.&lt;ref name="retired-pacific-admiral-censured"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1996/vp961016/10160391.htm|title=Retired Pacific Admiral is Censured "Unduly Familiar" Relationship with Marine Corps Office is Cited.|last=Eisman|first=Dale|publisher=The Virginian-Pilot|date=16 October 1996|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214093844/http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1996/vp961016/10160391.htm|archivedate=14 December 2007|accessdate=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
Gill pleaded guilty to the rape, and the other two men pleaded guilty to [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]].  The trial concluded in March 1996.

[[Prosecutor]]s had asked for the maximum [[Sentence (law)|sentences]] for the men, 10 years each. The [[Lay judges in Japan|judge]] sentenced Gill and Harp to seven years' imprisonment; Ledet received six and a half years. Their families also paid "[[Reparation (legal)|reparation]] money" to the family of the victim, a common practice in Japan.

==Aftermath==
The three men served prison terms in [[Penal system of Japan|Japanese prisons]] and were released in 2003 and then given [[Military discharge|other than honorable discharge]] from the military. After release, Rodrico Harp decried prison conditions in Japan and said that the [[Electronics manufacturing|electronics assembly]] [[prison labor]] he was forced to do amounted to [[Slavery|slave labor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/ex-marine-decries-nature-of-japan-prison-work-1.21905|title=Ex-Marine decries nature of Japan prison work|last=Allen|first=David|publisher=Stars and Stripes, Pacific Edition|date=18 July 2004|accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ledet, who had claimed he did not rape the girl, died in 2006 in an apparent [[murder–suicide]] in the United States. He was found in the third-floor apartment of Lauren Cooper, a junior [[Kennesaw State University]] student and acquaintance whom he had apparently [[rape|raped]] and then murdered, by [[Strangling|strangulation]]. He then took his own life by using a knife to slice open his veins at the elbows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2006/08/24/marine-in-slay-suicide-was-jailed-for-95-child-rape/|title=MARINE IN SLAY SUICIDE – WAS JAILED FOR ‘95 CHILD RAPE|last=Fagen|first=Cynthia|publisher=New York Post|date=24 August 2006|accessdate=30 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, the crime continues to be well known and to have political implications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2136025/End-era-U-S-cuts-presence-Japanese-outpost-Okinawa-9-000-Marines-prepare-out.html&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011 then-[[Minister of Defense (Japan)|Defense Minister]] [[Yasuo Ichikawa]] was the subject of a [[censure]] motion from the opposition [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] for failing to know the details of the rape. This followed his subordinate Satoshi Tanaka speaking with reporters in a bar and using euphemisms for rape to discuss moving the US [[Marine Corps Air Station Futenma|Futenma airbase]]. Tanaka was terminated as director of the Okinawa Defense Bureau,&lt;ref&gt;The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111210a2.html Upper House censures ministers - Ichikawa, Yamaoka censured in Diet December 10, 2011] Retrieved on August 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and in the cabinet reshuffle of January 13, 2012, Ichikawa was replaced by [[Naoki Tanaka (politician)|Naoki Tanaka]].&lt;ref&gt;The Japan Times [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120114a1.html New Noda Cabinet on tax push January 14, 2012] Retrieved on August 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A History of Warfare''''' is a book by military historian [[John Keegan]], which was published in 1993 by [[Random House]].

==Summary==
Keegan discusses [[ancient warfare|early warfare]], the proliferation of [[Bronze Age]] warfare and then [[Iron Age]] warfare ([[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[hoplite]]s and [[phalanx]]es, [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Roman legion|legion]]s and [[maniple (military unit)|maniple]]s). He also talks about the conquests of the "[[Eurasian nomads|horse people]]s", first under the [[Assyria]]ns, then the [[Achaemenids]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and [[Sassanids]]; then in the 7th century the [[Arab conquests|Arabs]] conquer a lot of territory, followed by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] under [[Genghis Khan]] and finally the last of the horse peoples under a Mongol named [[Tamerlane]], who unleashes massive carnage and destruction.

The rise of [[medieval Europe]] causes the raising of money for [[castles]], with [[infantry]] being paid to dig under castles for their destruction. [[Western Europe]] perfects castles that are impregnable. At the same time, [[cavalry]] is gradually eliminated from the battlefield; [[matchlock]]s, [[flintlock]]s and eventually [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] [[revolver]]s become dominant (they help [[Japan]] win the [[Russo-Japanese War]]).

In [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], [[mustard gas]], [[grenade]]s, [[artillery]] and [[gun]]s kill a massive number of [[soldier]]s that are buried in muddy graveyards on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. In [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], millions die on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] because of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s theories of living space ([[Lebensraum]])

Keegan takes issue with [[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s idea that war is an extension of politics, implying that war is carried on in a rational way under the conscious control of politicians. Rather he sees the existence of armies and warriors as distorting the nature of politics and of culture, sometimes becoming the dominant cultural form and that war itself is ultimately a disastrous and irrational outcome of a failure of politics and diplomacy. His book is less concerned with the technology and lists of battles as underlying motivations and [[social anthropology]].

Keegan dedicates his book to an ancestor, a Lieutenant Bridgman in the Régiment de Clare, one of the Wild Geese mercenaries of the French Army, who was killed at the [[Battle of Lauffeld]] in 1747.

==Reception==
In a review in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', [[Eliot A. Cohen]] wrote, "Despite some graceful writing and pointed observations, ''A History of Warfare'' fails to live up to the title's promise or the author's reputation". Cohen described it as "a vendetta against a liberal German soldier-theorist of the early nineteenth century [Clausewitz]".&lt;ref name=faffairs&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Eliot A. Cohen|authorlink1=Eliot A.

{{history of war}}

'''Air raid shelters''', also known as '''bomb shelters''', are structures for the protection of [[non-combatants]] as well as [[combatants]] against enemy attacks from the air. They are similar to [[bunker]]s in many regards, although they are not designed to defend against ground attack (but many have been successfully used as defensive structures in such situations).{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Prior to [[World War II]], in May 1924, an Air Raid Precautions Committee was set up in the [[United Kingdom]]. For years, little progress was made with shelters because of the apparently irreconcilable conflict between the need to send the public underground for shelter and the need to keep them above ground for protection against gas attacks. In February 1936 the [[Home Secretary]] appointed a technical Committee on Structural Precautions against Air Attack.

By November 1937, there had only been slow progress, because of a serious lack of data on which to base any design recommendations, and the Committee proposed that the Home Office should have its own department for research into structural precautions, rather than relying on research work done by the Bombing Test Committee to support the development of bomb design and strategy. This proposal was eventually implemented in January 1939.{{sfn|Baker|1978|p={{page needed|date=March 2014}}}}

During the [[Munich crisis]], local authorities dug trenches to provide shelter. After the crisis, the British Government decided to make these a permanent feature, with a standard design of precast concrete trench lining. Unfortunately these turned out to perform very poorly. They also decided to issue free to poorer households the [[#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelter]], and to provide steel props to create shelters in suitable basements.{{sfn|Baker|1978|p={{page needed|date=March 2014}}}}

==In World War II==
Air raid shelters were built specifically to serve as protection against enemy [[airstrike|air raid]]s. However, pre-existing [[edifice]]s designed for other functions, such as [[London Underground|underground]] stations (tube or [[subway station]]s), [[tunnel]]s, [[basement|cellar]]s in houses or [[basement]]s in larger establishments, and railway arches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urban75.org/brixton/history/station4.html |title=This what railway arches look like |publisher=Urban75.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; above ground, were suitable for safeguarding people during air raids. A commonly used home shelter known as the [[#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelter]] would be built in a garden and equipped with beds as a refuge from air raids.&lt;ref name=fortunecity1&gt;{{cite web|title=Air Raid Shelters|url=http://www.fortunecity.co.uk/meltingpot/oxford/330/shel/shel2.html|accessdate=1 Aug 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211142539/http://www.fortunecity.co.uk/meltingpot/oxford/330/shel/shel2.html|archivedate=11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cellars ===
[[File:Bunker04 HLFM01.JPG|right|thumbnail|Single-person air raid shelter on display at the [[Aviation Museum Hannover-Laatzen|Günter Leonhardt aviation museum]] near Hannover, Germany.]]
Cellars have always been much more important in Continental Europe than in the United Kingdom, and especially in [[Germany]] almost all houses and apartment blocks have been and still are built with cellars. For this reason, air-raid precautions during World War II in Germany could be much more readily implemented by the authorities than was possible in the UK. All that was necessary was to ascertain that cellars were being prepared to accommodate all the residents of a building; that all the cellar hatch and window protections were in place; that access to the cellars was safe in the event of an air raid; that once inside, the occupants were secure for any incidents other than direct hits during the air raid; and that means of escape in case of a real emergency were easily available.

However, the inadequacies of cellars and basements became apparent in the firestorms during the [[Firebombing|incendiary attack]]s on the larger German inner cities, especially [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|Hamburg]] and [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden]]. When burning buildings and apartment blocks above them collapsed in the raging winds (which could reach well over 800&amp;nbsp;°C), the occupants often became trapped in these basement shelters, which had also become overcrowded after the arrival of inhabitants from other buildings rendered unsafe in earlier attacks. Some occupants perished from heat stroke or carbon monoxide poisoning.

=== Hochbunker ===
[[File:Hochbunker von Trier.jpg|right|thumb|The Hochbunker in [[Trier]]]]
[[File:Wuensdorf Winkelturm.jpg|right|thumb|Winkelturm in [[Wünsdorf]], [[Brandenburg]]]]

''Hochbunker(s)'', or "high-rise" [[bunker]]s or ([[blockhouse]]s), were a peculiarly German type of construction, designed to relieve the pressure German authorities were facing to accommodate additional numbers of the population in high-density housing areas, as well as pedestrians on the streets during air raids. In contrast to other shelters, these buildings were considered completely bomb-proof. They also had the advantage of being built upward, which was much cheaper than downward excavation. There were no equivalents of ''hochbunkers'' in the cities of the Allied countries.

''Hochbunkers'' usually consisted of large concrete blocks above ground with walls between 1 m and 1.5 m thick and with huge lintels above doorways and openings. They often had a constant interior temperature of 7 to 10&amp;nbsp;°C, which made them perfectly suitable for laboratories, both during and after the war. They were designated to protect people, administrative centres, important archives, and works of art.

Their structures took many forms: usually consisting of square blocks, or of low, long rectangular or triangular shapes; straight towers of a square plan rising to great heights, or round tower-like edifices, even pyramidal constructions. Some of the circular towers contained helical floors that gradually curved their way upward within the circular walls. Many of these structures may still be seen to this day. They have been converted into offices, storage space, and some have even been adapted for hotels, hospitals and schools, as well as many other peacetime purposes. In [[Schöneberg]], a block of flats was built over the Pallasstrasse air-raid shelter after World War II. During the Cold War, NATO used the shelter for food storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://7grad.org/Exkursionen/Muenster/Hochbunker/hochbunker.html |title=Hochbunker |publisher=7grad.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/lupinpooter/berlin.htm Berlin hochbunker, etc.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040505233512/http://www.geocities.com/lupinpooter/berlin.htm |date=May 5, 2004 }} 2009-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ladd|2004|p=393}}

The cost of demolishing these edifices after the war would have been enormous, as the attempts at breaking up one of the six so-called [[Flak tower]]s of Vienna proved. The attempted demolition caused no more than a crack in one of the walls of the tower, after which efforts were abandoned. Only the  [[Zoo Tower]] in Berlin was successfully demolished.

One particular variant of the Hochbunker was the ''Winkeltürme'', named after its designer, Leo Winkel of Duisburg. Winkel patented his design in 1934, and from 1936 on, Germany built 98 ''Winkeltürme'' of five different types. The towers had a conical shape with walls that curved downward to a reinforced base.  The dimensions of the towers varied.  Diameters ranged between 8.4 and 10 meters and the height between 20 and 25 meters. The walls of the towers had a minimum thickness for reinforced concrete of 0.8 m and 1.5 m for ordinary concrete. The towers were able to shelter between 164 and 500 people, depending on the type. The intent with the ''Winkeltürme'' and the other ''hochbunkers'' was to protect workers in rail yards and industrial areas. Because of their shape, the towers became known colloquially as "cigar stubs" or "sugar beets".

The theory behind the ''Winkeltürme ''was that the curved walls would deflect any bomb hitting the tower, directing it down towards the base.  The towers had a small footprint, which was probably a greater protection.  A US bomb did hit one tower in Bremen in October 1944; the bomb exploded through the roof, killing five people inside.

===United Kingdom===

====Cellars====
Cellars in the UK, however, were mainly included only in larger houses, and in houses built up to the period of [[World War I]], after which detached and semi-detached properties were constructed without cellars, usually to avoid the higher building costs entailed. Since house building had increased vastly between the wars, the lack of cellars in more recent housing was to become a major problem in the Air Raid Precautions (ARP) programmes in the UK during World War II.

Alternatives had to be found speedily once it became clear that Germany was contemplating air raids as a means of demoralising the population and disrupting supply lines in the UK. Initial recommendations were that householders should shelter under the stairs. Later, authorities supplied materials to households to construct communal street shelters and [[#Morrison shelter|Morrison]] and [[#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelter]]s.

====Basements====
[[Basement]]s also became available for the use of air raid shelters. Basements under factory premises, schools, hospitals, department stores and other businesses were utilised. However, these ''ad hoc'' shelters could bring additional dangers, as heavy machinery and materials or water storage facilities above the shelter, and insufficient support structures threatened to cause the collapse of basements.

When Wilkinson's Lemonade factory in [[North Shields]] received a direct hit on Saturday, 3 May 1941 during a German attack on the north-east coast of England, 107 occupants lost their lives when heavy machinery fell through the ceiling of the basement in which they were sheltering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/2963761.stm |title=Wilkinson's Lemonade factory |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-04-21 |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://northshields173.org/ |title=Account of raid on Wilkinson's Lemonade factory |website=North Shields 173 |date= |accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Railway arches and subways (underpasses)====
Railway arches and [[Subway (underpass)|subway]]s were also used in the UK for air raid protection at all times during [[World War II]].

Railway arches were deep, curved structures of brick or concrete, set into the vertical sidewalls of railway lines, which had been intended originally for commercial depots, etc. The arches were covered usually with wooden or brick [[screen-wall|screen]]- or [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain walls]], thus giving a considerable amount of protection against air raids – provided, of course, that railway lines were not the prime target of the attack at the particular time and so being more likely to suffer from direct hits. Each arch could accommodate anything from 60 to 150 or so persons. However, fewer people could find shelter at night as sleeping areas for the occupants took up more of the space available – a limitation applying to any other type of shelter as well. Subways were actual [[thoroughfares]] also in the shape of arches, normally allowing [[Transit passage|passage]] underneath railway lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daveh.org.uk/hwyard/arches/ |title=Railway arches |publisher=Daveh.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303081715/http://www.daveh.org.uk/hwyard/arches/ |archivedate=2010-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/ic1/05.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040401070746/http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/ic1/05.html|date=April 1, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====London Underground tube stations====
[[File:London Underground Air Raid Shelter Sign.jpg|right|thumbnail|Recreation of a London Underground air raid shelter sign.]]

Prior to the beginning of the war, shelter policy had been determined by [[Sir John Anderson]], then Lord Privy Seal and, on the declaration of war, Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security. Anderson announced the policy to Parliament on 20 April 1939,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/apr/20/shelter-policy#S5CV0346P0_19390420_HOC_73 |title=Shelter policy |publisher=Hansard.millbanksystems.com |date=1939-04-20 |accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on a report from a committee chaired by Lord Hailey. This reaffirmed a policy of dispersal and eschewed the use of deep shelters, including the use of '''tube stations''' and '''underground tunnels''' as public shelters. Reasons given were the spread of disease due to the lack of toilet facilities at many stations, the inherent danger of people falling onto the lines, and that people sheltering in the stations and tunnels might be tempted to stay in them day and night because they would feel safer there than outside the stations.

None of these concerns had been borne out by experience during the bombing raids of the First World War, when eighty specially adapted tube stations had been pressed into use, but in a highly controversial decision in January 1924,  Anderson, then chairman of the Air Raid Precautions Committee of Imperial Defence and had ruled out the tube station shelter option in any future conflict.

Following the intensive bombing of London on 7 September 1940 and the overnight raids of 7/8 September, there was considerable pressure to change the policy but, even following a review on 17 September, the Government stood firm. On 19 September, William Mabane, parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Home Security, urged the public not to leave their [[#Anderson shelter|Anderson shelter]]s for public shelters, saying it deprived others of shelter. "We're going to improve the amenities in existing shelters," he promised. "We're setting about providing better lighting and better accommodation for sleeping and better sanitary arrangements." The Ministries of Home Security and Transport jointly issued an "urgent appeal", telling the public "to refrain from using Tube stations as air-raid shelters except in the case of urgent necessity".

However, the Government was then confronted with an episode of mass disobedience. Over the night of 19/20 September, thousands of Londoners were taking matters in their own hands. They had flocked to the Tubes for shelter. At some stations, they began to arrive as early as 4pm, with bedding and bags of food to sustain them for the night. By the time the evening rush hour was in progress, they had already staked their "pitches" on the platforms. Police did not intervene. Some station managers, on their own initiatives, provided additional toilet facilities. Transport Minister John Reith, and the chairman of London Transport, Lord Ashfield, inspected [[Holborn tube station]] to see conditions for themselves.

The Government then realised that they could not contain this popular revolt. On 21 September, it abruptly changed policy, removing its objections to the use of tube stations. In what it called part of its "deep shelter extension policy", it decided to close the short section of [[Piccadilly line]] from Holborn to [[Aldwych tube station|Aldwych]], and convert different sections for specific wartime use, including a public air raid shelter at Aldwych. Floodgates were installed at various points to protect the network should bombs breach the tunnels under the Thames, or large water mains in the vicinity of stations. Seventy-nine stations were fitted with bunks for 22,000 people, supplied with first aid facilities and equipped with chemical toilets. 124 canteens opened in all parts of the tube system. Shelter marshals were appointed, whose function it was to keep order, give first aid and assist in case of the flooding of the tunnels.
[[File:Blitz West End Air Shelter.jpg|thumb|left|[[London Underground]] station in use as an air-raid shelter during World War II.]]
Businesses (for example [[Plessey|Plessey Ltd]]) were allowed to use the Underground stations and unopened tunnels, government offices were installed in others and the anti-aircraft centre for London used a station as its headquarters.

However, tube stations and tunnels were still vulnerable to a direct hit and several such incidents did occur:

On 14 October 1940, a bomb penetrated the road and tunnel at [[Balham tube station]], blew up the water mains and sewage pipes, and killed 66 people.

At Bank station a direct hit caused a crater of 120&amp;nbsp;ft by 100&amp;nbsp;ft on 11 January 1941, the road above the station collapsed and killed 56 occupants.

However, the highest death toll was caused during an accident at the unfinished [[Bethnal Green tube station]] on 8 March 1943, when 1,500 people entered the station. The crowd suddenly surged forwards  on hearing the unfamiliar sound of a new type of anti-aircraft rocket being launched nearby. Someone stumbled on the stairs, and the crowd pushing on, were falling on top of one another, and 173 people were crushed to death in the disaster.

Nevertheless, the London Underground system during the war was considered one of the safest means of protecting relatively many people in a high-density area of the capital. An estimated 170,000 people sheltered in the tunnels and stations during World War II. Although not a great number in comparison to the total number of the inhabitants of the capital, it almost certainly saved many lives of the people who probably would have had to find alternative, less secure means of protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwar2exraf.co.uk/Online%20Museum/Museum%20Docs/airraidshelterspage7.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403035111/http://www.worldwar2exraf.co.uk/Online%20Museum/Museum%20Docs/airraidshelterspage7.htm|date=April 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists and photographers such as [[Henry Moore]] and [[Bill Brandt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgfl.net/lgfl/accounts/holnet/upload/learningzone/londonatwar/shelter/index.html |title=HOLNET - London at War 1939–1945 - Shelter |publisher=Lgfl.net |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228044832/http://www.lgfl.net/lgfl/accounts/holnet/upload/learningzone/londonatwar/shelter/index.html |archivedate=December 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were employed as war artists to document life in London's shelters during the Second World War.

====Other tunnels====
Many other types of tunnels were adapted for shelters to protect the civil population, and the military and administrative establishment in the UK during the war. Some had been built many years before, some had been part of an ancient defence system, and some had belonged to commercial enterprises, such as coalmining.

The [[Victoria Tunnel (Newcastle)|Victoria tunnels]] at [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], for example, completed as long ago as 1842, and used for transporting coal from the collieries to the river Tyne, had been closed in 1860 and remained so until 1939. 12 m deep in places, the tunnels, stretching in parts beneath the city of Newcastle, were converted to air raid shelters with a capacity for 9,000 people. Furthermore, tunnels linked to [[Manchester Cathedral Steps|landing stages]] built on the [[River Irwell]] in [[Manchester]] at the end of the 19th century were also used as air-raid shelters.

The large medieval labyrinth of tunnels beneath [[Dover Castle]] had been built originally as part of the defensive system of the approaches to England, extended over the centuries and further excavated and reinforced during World Wars I and II, until it was capable of accommodating large parts of the secret defence systems protecting the British Isles. On 26 May 1940 it became the headquarters under [[Vice Admiral]] [[Bertram Ramsay]] of “[[Operation Dynamo]]”, from which the rescue and evacuation of up to 338,000 troops from France was directed.

In [[Stockport]], six miles south of Manchester, four sets of underground air raid shelter tunnels for civilian use were dug into the red sandstone on which the town centre stands. Preparation started in September 1938 and the first set of shelters was opened on 28 October 1939. (Stockport was not bombed until 11 October 1940.) The smallest of the tunnel shelters could accommodate 2,000 people and the largest 3,850 (subsequently expanded to take up to 6,500 people.) The largest of the [[Stockport Air Raid Shelters]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airraidshelters.org.uk |title=Stockport Air Raid Shelters |publisher=Airraidshelters.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100806045825/http://www.airraidshelters.org.uk/| archivedate= 6 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; are open to the public as part of the town's museum service.

In southeast London, residents made use of the [[Chislehurst Caves]] beneath [[Chislehurst]], a {{convert|22|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} network of underground caves which have existed since the [[Middle Ages]] for the mining of [[chalk]] and [[flint]].

====Street communal shelter====
In the United Kingdom, it was being recognised early that public shelters in open spaces, especially near streets, were urgently needed for pedestrians, drivers and passengers in passing vehicles, etc. The programme of building '''street communal shelters''' commenced in March 1940, the government supplying the materials, and being the moving force behind the scheme, and private builders executing the work under the supervision of surveyors. These shelters consisted of 14-inch brick walls and {{convert|1|ft|m|adj=mid|-thick}} reinforced concrete roofs, similarly to, but much larger than, the private shelters in backyards and gardens being introduced slightly later. The communal shelters were usually intended to accommodate about fifty persons, and were divided into various sections by interior walls with openings connecting the different sections. Sections were normally furnished with six bunks.

The construction work then went on rapidly, until the resources of concrete and bricks began to be depleted due to the excessive demand placed on them so suddenly. Also, the performance of the early street shelters was a serious blow to public confidence. Their walls were shaken down either by earth shock or blast, and the concrete roofs then fell onto the helpless occupants, and this was there for all to see.{{sfn|Baker|1978|p={{page needed|date=March 2014}}}}  At around the same time rumours of accidents started to circulate, such as on one occasion people being drowned due to a burst main filling up the shelter with water. Although much improved designs were being introduced whose performance had been demonstrated in explosion trials, communal shelters became highly unpopular, and shortly afterwards householders were being encouraged to build or have built private shelters on their properties, or within their houses, with materials being supplied by the government.

====Anderson shelter====

[[File:Anderson3.jpg|thumb|right|Children preparing to sleep in the Anderson shelter in their living room during frequent bombing raids on Bournemouth in 1941.]]
The '''Anderson shelter''' was designed in 1938 by William Paterson and Oscar Carl (Karl) Kerrison in response to a request from the Home Office. It was named after Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]], then [[Lord Privy Seal]] with special responsibility for preparing air-raid precautions immediately prior to the outbreak of World War II, and it was he who then initiated the development of the shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.andersonshelters.org.uk/history.html|title=Anderson Shelters - History|website=www.andersonshelters.org.uk|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/21/how-britains-abandoned-anderson-shelters-are-being-brought-back-to-life|title=How Britain's abandoned Anderson shelters are being brought back to life|last=Lavelle|first=Daniel|date=2018-08-21|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After evaluation by Dr David Anderson, Bertram Lawrence Hurst, and Sir Henry Jupp, of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]], the design was released for production.

Anderson shelters were designed to accommodate up to six people. The main principle of protection was based on curved and straight [[corrugated galvanised iron|galvanised corrugated steel]] [[Structural insulated panel|panel]]s. Six curved panels were bolted together at the top, so forming the main body of the shelter, three straight sheets on either side, and two more straight panels were fixed to each end, one containing the door—a total of fourteen panels. A small drainage [[sump]] was often incorporated in the floor to collect rainwater seeping into the shelter. The shelters were {{convert|6|ft|m}} high, {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|6.5|ft|m}} long. They were either buried 4&amp;nbsp;ft (1.2 m) deep in the soil and then covered with a minimum of {{convert|15|in|cm}} of soil above the roof or in some cases installed inside people's houses and covered with sandbags. When they were buried outside, the earth banks could be planted with vegetables and flowers, that at times could be quite an appealing sight and in this way would become the subject of competitions of the best-planted shelter among householders in the neighbourhood. The internal fitting out of the shelter was left to the owner and so there were wide variations in comfort.&lt;ref name="fortunecity1"/&gt;

Anderson shelters were issued free to all householders who earned less than £5 a week (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|5|1939|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-1}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}, when adjusted for [[inflation]]). Those with a higher income were charged £7 (£{{inflation|UK|7|1939|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-1}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}) for their shelter. One and a half  million shelters of this type were distributed between February 1939 and the outbreak of war. During the war a further 2.1 million were erected.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence James. Warrior Race: A History of the British at War (2003) p. 623.&lt;/ref&gt;  Large numbers were manufactured at [[John Summers &amp; Sons]] ironworks at [[Shotton, Flintshire|Shotton]] on Deeside with production peaking at 50,000 units per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.angelfire.com/fl/shotton/history11.html |title=John Summers &amp; Sons |first=Keith|last=Atlkinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anderson shelters performed well under blast and ground shock, because they had good connectivity and ductility, which meant that they could absorb a great deal of energy through plastic deformation without falling apart. (This was in marked contrast to other trench shelters which used concrete for the sides and roof, which were inherently unstable when disturbed by the effects of an explosion – if the roof slab lifted, the walls fell in under the static earth pressure; if the walls were pushed in, the roof would be unsupported at one edge and would fall.) However, when the pattern of all night alerts became established, it was realised that in winter Anderson shelters installed outside were cold damp holes in the ground and often flooded in wet weather, and so their occupancy factor would be poor. This led to the development of the indoor [[#Morrison shelter|Morrison shelter]].{{sfn|Baker|1978|p={{page needed|date=March 2014}}}}

At the end of the war in Europe, households who had received an Anderson shelter were expected to remove their shelters and local authorities began the task of reclaiming the corrugated iron. Householders who wished to keep their Anderson shelter (or more likely the valuable metal) could pay a nominal fee.

Because of the large number made and their robustness, many Anderson shelters still survive. Many were dug up after the war and converted into storage sheds for use in gardens and [[Allotment (gardening)|allotments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.edu/~wgreen/ECDandersonsh.html |title=Development of the Anderson shelter |publisher=Richmond.edu |date= |accessdate=17 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302090230/http://www.richmond.edu/~wgreen/ECDandersonsh.html |archive-date=2007-03-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/21/how-britains-abandoned-anderson-shelters-are-being-brought-back-to-life|title=How Britain's abandoned Anderson shelters are being brought back to life|last=Lavelle|first=Daniel|date=2018-08-21|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Morrison shelter====
{{Commonscat-inline|Morrison shelter}}
[[File:A couple sleeping in a Morrison shelter during the Second World War. D2055.jpg|thumb|A couple demonstrating the use of a Morrison shelter]]
[[File:Morrison Shelter on Trial- Testing the New Indoor Shelter, 1941 D2294.jpg|thumb|A Morrison shelter containing a dummy, after the house it was in had been destroyed as a test]] 
The '''Morrison shelter''', officially termed ''Table (Morrison) Indoor Shelter'', had a cage-like construction beneath it. It was designed by [[John Baker, Baron Baker|John Baker]] and named after [[Herbert Stanley Morrison|Herbert Morrison]], the [[Ministry of Home Security|Minister of Home Security]] at the time. It was the result of the realisation that due to the lack of house cellars it was necessary to develop an effective type of indoor shelter.
The shelters came in [[Ready-to-assemble furniture|assembly kit]]s, to be bolted together inside the home. They were approximately 6&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in (2 m) long, 4&amp;nbsp;ft (1.2 m) wide and 2&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in (0.75 m) high, had a solid 1/8 in (3&amp;nbsp;mm) steel plate “table” top, welded wire mesh sides, and a metal lath “mattress”- type floor. Altogether it had 359 parts and had 3 tools supplied with the pack.

The  shelter was provided free to households whose combined income was less than £400 per year (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|400|1939|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-3}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}).

When Head of the Engineering Department at [[Cambridge University]], Professor Sir John Baker (latterly Baron Baker) presented an undergraduate lecture on the principles of design of the shelter, as an interesting introduction to his theory of plastic design of structures and it can be summarised as follows:

{{quote|It was impractical to produce a design for mass production that could withstand a direct hit, and so it was a matter of selecting a suitable design target that would save lives in many cases of blast damage to bombed houses. Examination of bombed buildings indicated that in many instances, one end wall of a house was sucked or blown out by a nearby blast, and the floor of the first storey pivoted about its other end (supported by a largely intact wall) and killed the inhabitants. The Morrison shelter was therefore designed to be able to withstand the upper floor falling, of a typical two storey-house undergoing a partial collapse. The shelter was designed to absorb this energy by plastic deformation, since this can absorb two or three orders of magnitude more energy than elastic deformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Robertson |url=http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/1925-1950/baker6.html |title=The Baker experiment with a Morrison shelter model |publisher=G.eng.cam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100620211858/http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/125/1925-1950/baker6.html| archivedate= 20 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its design enabled the family to sleep under the shelter at night or during raids, and to use it as a dining table in the daytime, making it a practical item in the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.co.uk/meltingpot/oxford/330/shel/shel3.html |title=The Morrison shelter design |publisher=Fortunecity.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306043354/http://www.fortunecity.co.uk/meltingpot/oxford/330/shel/shel3.html |archivedate=March 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Half a million Morrison shelters had been distributed by the end of 1941, with a further 100,000 being added in 1943 to prepare the population for the expected German [[V-1 flying bomb]] (doodlebug) attacks.

In one examination of 44 severely damaged houses it was found that three people had been killed, 13 seriously injured, and 16 slightly injured out of a total of 136 people who had occupied Morrison shelters; thus 120 out of 136 escaped from severely bomb-damaged houses without serious injury. Furthermore,  it was discovered that the fatalities had occurred in a house which had suffered a direct hit, and some of the severely injured were in shelters sited incorrectly within the houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningcurve.gov.uk/homefront/bombing/shelters/source2.htm |title=Examination of effectiveness of Morrison shelter |publisher=learningcurve.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828204751/http://www.learningcurve.gov.uk/homefront/bombing/shelters/source2.htm |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1950 the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors made an award of £3,000 (£{{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|3000|1950|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=-3}}}}) to Baker for his design of the Morrison shelter.{{sfn|Baker|1978|p={{page needed|date=March 2014}}}}

====Stanton shelters====

[[File:Disused air-raid shelter, Dilton, New Forest - geograph.org.uk - 430429.jpg|right|thumbnail|An abandoned Stanton shelter at the disused airfield, [[RAF Beaulieu]] (2007)]]
A segment shelter manufactured by the Stanton Ironworks, [[Ilkeston]], Derbyshire.  The shop producing spun-concrete lighting columns ceased production and turned over to concrete air-raid shelters, of which 100,000 tons were manufactured, principally for the air ministry. Reinforced concrete proved an ideal material for air-raid shelters, being strong and resistant to shock with no deterioration with the passing of time. This type of segment shelter was of simple design and of low cost—any length of shelter could be built up from the pre-cast steel reinforced concrete segments. The segments were 20&amp;nbsp;inches wide; a pair of them formed an arch 7 feet high and transverse struts were provided to ensure rigidity. These fitted into longitudinal bearers which were grooved to receive the foot of each segment. Each pair of segments was bolted together at the apex of the arch and each segment was also bolted to its neighbour, the joints being sealed with a bituminous compound. The convenient handling of these segments enabled them to be transported onto sites where close access by motor lorry was not possible. Partly buried in the ground, with a suitably screened entrance, this bolted shelter afforded safe protection against blast and splinters.&lt;ref&gt;The Stanton Ironworks Co. Stanton at War 1939–45.

=== Other construction ===
[[File:Children outside air raid shelter, Gresford (4365436432).jpg|thumb|Children outside air raid shelter in [[Gresford]], 1939]]
Some air-raid shelters were constructed in residential building schemes in anticipation of the Second World War. There is a surviving example at [[St Leonard's Court]] in [[East Sheen]], southwest London.

Military air-raid shelters included [[blast pen]]s at [[airfield]]s for the security of [[aircrew]]s and [[aircraft maintenance]] personnel away from the main airbase buildings.

Few shelters could survive a direct bomb-hit. The German authorities claimed that ''hochbunkers'' were totally bomb-proof, but none were targeted by any of the 41 10-ton [[Grand Slam bomb|Grand Slam]] earthquake bombs dropped by the RAF by the end of World War II. Two of these bombs were dropped on the ''U-Bootbunkerwerft'' [[Valentin submarine pens]] near [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] and these barely penetrated {{convert|4|to|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} of reinforced concrete, bringing down the roof.

More recently, the penetration by laser-guided [[smart bomb|"smart bombs"]] of the [[Amiriyah shelter]] during the 1991 [[Gulf War]] showed how vulnerable even reinforced concrete shelters are to direct hits from bunker-buster bombs. However, the air-raid shelters are built to protect the civilian population, so protection against a direct hit is of secondary value. The most important dangers are the blast and shrapnel. It is unlikely that any military enemy would intentionally target a civilian shelter, even if it were [[carpet bombing]] a city.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

== Air-raid shelters in modern times ==

[[File:Beth-El Industries Blast Valves installed in bomb shelter.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Blast protection [[Blast valve|valve]]s installed in a bomb shelter]]

Old air-raid shelters, such as the [[#Anderson shelter|Anderson]], can still be found in back gardens, in which they are commonly used as sheds, or (on the roof which is covered with earth) as vegetable patches. Some are left empty or are filled with debris.

Countries which have kept air-raid shelters intact and in ready condition include [[Switzerland]], [[Spain]] and [[Finland]].

===Switzerland===

Many Swiss houses and apartment blocks still have structurally reinforced, underground basements, often featuring a concrete door around {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick. In more modern, post-war times, these shelters are often used as storage, with the footprint of the reinforced basement divided up into individual storage units according to the number of apartments in the house. The basement shelters are built to more stringent building codes, as the ceiling especially should protect shelter-seeking people from the house collapsing. Although most Swiss houses provide their own shelters, those that don't are required by law to post directions to the nearest shelter.

===Spain===
[[File:Mhcb070401 008.jpg|thumb|Air-raid Shelter 307 (''Refugi 307'') in Barcelona, was built during [[Spanish Civil War]]]]
[[File:ValenciaRefugio.JPG|thumb|Air-raid shelter built during the [[Spanish Civil War]] in Valencia.]]
[[Barcelona]] was [[Bombing of Barcelona|severely bombed]] by Italian and German Air Forces during [[Spanish Civil War]], particularly in 1937 and 1938. Underground tunnels were used as shelters at the same time that the population undertook the building of bomb shelters under the coordination of a committee for civil defense (Catalan: ''Junta de defensa passiva'') providing planning and technical assistance. Hundreds of bomb shelters were built. Most of them are recorded, but only a few are well preserved. Among these stand out the ''Plaça del Diamant'' refuge as well as air-shelter 307 (''Refugi 307''), today one of the [[Barcelona City History Museum]] heritage sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bomb shelter 307 in Barcelona|url=http://museuhistoria.bcn.cat/en/node/661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cities with extant bomb shelters from the Spanish Civil War include [[Madrid]], [[Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha|Guadalajara]], [[Alcalá de Henares]], [[Santander, Spain|Santander]], [[Jaén, Spain|Jaén]], [[Alcañiz]], [[Shelter of Cervantes|Alcoy]], [[Valencia]] and [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]. During the war, Cartagena, an important naval base, was one of the main targets for Franco's bombers. Cartagena suffered between 40 and 117 bombings (sources are mixed about the number of attacks). The most dramatic was one carried on by the German [[Condor Legion]] on November 25, 1936. The largest air raid shelter in Cartagena, which could accommodate up to 5.500 persons, has been a museum since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cartagena Spanish Civil War air raid shelter museum|url=http://www.cartagenapuertodeculturas.com/publicas/que_visitar/refugio/_QpBOWZjSXH_U1cLNsvPN-Q|accessdate=6 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602123922/http://www.cartagenapuertodeculturas.com/publicas/que_visitar/refugio/_QpBOWZjSXH_U1cLNsvPN-Q|archive-date=2016-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Israelis Hiding in a Bomb Shelter.jpg|thumb|The inside of an Israeli bomb shelter in 2012.]]
The [[State of Israel]] required all buildings to have access to air-raid shelters from 1951, and all new flats possess access to [[Merkhav Mugan]]. All medical and educational facilities are prepared for CRBN attacks (as of 2010) (as an example each surgery room is built to withstand a direct missile hit); some are built with closed-cycle air systems and are capable of being resistant to chemical agents for short periods of time; in addition all must include chemical air filtering systems. The public air-raid shelters are commonly employed as game rooms in peacetime so that the children will be comfortable to enter them at a time of need, and will not be frightened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadstreetreview.com/index.php/main/article/in_the_bomb_shelter_the_brighter_side_of_war/ |title=In the bomb shelter: The brighter side of war |publisher=Broad Street Review |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Home front command,תקנות מוסדות בריאות {{c}},2010, p4 section 280 subsection ב [http://www.oref.org.il/sip_storage/FILES/0/1310.pdf]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oref_special_considurations_for_medical_facilities"&gt;Home front command,תקנות מוסדות בריאות {{c}},2010,[http://www.oref.org.il/sip_storage/FILES/0/1310.pdf]{{dead link|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="knesset_law_securing_schools"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/m01664.pdf |title=Shelters in educational institutions |publisher=Israeli government |date= |accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Home front command,תקנות למוסדות חינוך{{c}},2010,[http://www.oref.org.il/sip_storage/FILES/9/1309.pdf] {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===

[[File:Väestönsuojan ovi.jpg|thumbnail|A normal Finnish S1-shelter steel door. S is short for ''suoja'' (protection, shelter).]]
Finland has over 40,000 air-raid shelters which can house 3.8 million people (71% of the population). Private homes rarely have them, but houses over {{convert|600|m2|abbr=on}} are obliged to build them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Interior+Ministry+plans+to+reduce+number+of+new+strategic+shelters++/1135219741094 |title=Helsingin Sanomat - International Edition - Home |publisher=Hs.fi |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fire inspectors check the shelters every ten years and flaws have to be repaired or corrected as soon as possible. The law requires that inhabitants of apartment blocks must clear the shelters and put them into action in less than 72 hours. Half of the air-raid shelter has to be ready to use in two hours. The types of shelters are:
*K, a small shelter for a small apartment house.
*S1, a usual shelter for apartment house.
*S3, lightweight shelter in solid rock or heavyweight shelter of ferroconcrete.
*S6, large shelters in solid rock that must be able to withstand a 6 bar pressure wave.

All shelters must have:
*an electric and hand-operated air-conditioning system, which can protect from biological and chemical weapons and radioactive particles.
*a radiometer
*dry toilets
*a fixed-line interface
*a spare exit
*water tanks
*a first aid kit

===Singapore===

Since 1998, Singapore has required all new houses and flats to have a shelter built to certain specifications. The [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]] rationalizes building such shelters in high-rise buildings by noting that weapon effects tend to be localized, and are unlikely to cause an entire building to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Singapore Civil Defence Force |url=http://www.scdf.gov.sg/building_professionals/FAQ/cd_shelter.html |title=FAQ on CD Shelters |publisher=Scdf.gov.sg |date= |accessdate=2010-06-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528221413/http://www.scdf.gov.sg/Building_Professionals/FAQ/cd_shelter.html |archivedate=28 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alice Jane Evans''' is a British actress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://showbiz.sky.com/showbiz/picture_gallery/0,,50001-1253224,00.html Photo gallery], Showbiz.sky.com; accessed 23 September 2014.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629122227/http://showbiz.sky.com/showbiz/picture_gallery/0%2C%2C50001-1253224%2C00.html |date=29 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Evans, the daughter of educators and the granddaughter of a coal miner, was born in [[Bristol]] England to English parents, mathematician [[David Evans (mathematician)|David Evans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alice Evans|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/700/000352641/|publisher=NNDB|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Janet Evans. She was raised in [[Bristol]], England, along with her two British-born brothers, Anthony and Philip.&lt;ref name="ES"&gt;"Meet La Belle Anglaise" by Anna Pursglove, ''Evening Standard'', 15 December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[University College London]] with a [[2:1]] in French and Italian.&lt;ref name="ES"/&gt;

==Career==
After graduation, she moved to Paris' [[Cours Florent]]. She gained work in French television, with her breakthrough role as French student Susan in the popular French sitcom, ''Elisa Top Modele'', which ran for 18 months. Next, she went to Italy to play "Nathalie", in the 1998 Italian miniseries ''[[Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna]]''. Her first English-speaking role was in the [[Highlander (TV series)|Highlander]] episode 'Patient Number 7'. After making her first film, ''Monsieur Naphtali'' (1999), Oscar-winning director [[Claude Lelouch]] cast Evans as Macha in ''[[Une pour toutes]]'' (1999), alongside [[Sami Naceri]] and [[Anne Parillaud]].

In 1999, [[Disney]] cast Evans alongside [[Glenn Close]], [[Gérard Depardieu]] and her future husband, [[Ioan Gruffudd]], in ''[[102 Dalmatians]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Mia Sulpor|url=https://variety.com/2000/scene/vpage/disney-lets-dogs-out-1117789265|title=Disney lets dogs out|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=15 November 2000|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=102 Dalmatians (2000)|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/102-dalmatians-2000-2|publisher=British Board of Film Classification|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans' mother died at age 59, the day before Evans's final screen test for the role, which introduced her to British viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alice Evans Biography|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0262521/bio|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After appearing in ''[[Blackball (film)|Blackball]]'', she moved to Los Angeles in 2003. She has since appeared in both television and film, such as ''[[The Mentalist]]'', ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers &amp; Sisters]]'', ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', and ''[[Grimm (TV series)|Grimm]]''. Evans also had a recurring turn as the villainous Esther on ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Shaunna Murphy|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2012/02/09/vampire-diaries-esther-arrives-alice-evans|title='The Vampire Diaries': Talk tonight's shocking twist, and find out what's next from producer Julie Plec|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=9 February 2012|accessdate=2 June 2016|quote=When Original vampire mama Esther (Alice Evans) returned to Mystic Falls after spending the last millennium six feet under, we knew she’d have some deeply hidden tricks up her sleeve.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Originals (TV series)|The Originals]]''.

==Personal life==
Evans first met actor [[Ioan Gruffudd]] during the filming of ''102 Dalmatians'', while she was in her eight-year relationship with Olivier Widmaier Picasso, a grandson of painter [[Pablo Picasso]]. She lived with Picasso in Paris, and they became engaged but later broke up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lucy Cavendish|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4721154/La-jeune-fille-anglaise.html|title=La jeune fille anglaise|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=22 January 2001|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gruffudd stated on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' that he and Evans became engaged on New Year's Day 2006 after Evans gave him an ultimatum, declaring that after 7 years together she wasn't going to hang around any longer unless she was his wife.&lt;ref name=late2007&gt;Ioan Gruffudd, ''Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson'', 21 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They married on 14 September 2007 in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Mary Margaret|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20057165,00.html|title=Fantastic Four Star Ioan Gruffudd Gets Married|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=15 September 2007|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple resides in [[Los Angeles, California]], and has two daughters, Ella Betsi Janet (born 6 September 2009) and Elsie Marigold (born 13 September 2013). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Andrew Asare|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/10/02/ioan-gruffudd-alice-evans-baby|title=Ioan Gruffudd and Alice Evans welcome second child|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2 October 2013|accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Art theft]] and [[looted art|looting]] occurred on a massive scale during [[World War II]]. It originated with the policies of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] countries, primarily [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Japan]], which systematically looted occupied territories. Near the end of the war the [[Soviet Union]], in turn, began looting reclaimed and occupied territories. "The grand scale of looted artwork by the Nazis has resulted in the loss of many pieces being scattered across the world." (Minyard, 2007)

Although the looting of "cultural heritage" of the German people and private collectors was not permitted in the 1945 agreement of Yalta, following the defeat of Germany by the Allied forces the following goods disappeared: three truckloads of precious art, which was listed in a confiscated list by the US forces (in the mine Merker in Thuringia), and one trainload of 20 wagons loaded with artwork and jewels from Hungary (named the "gold train").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} According to a 2001 ''Der Spiegel'' article,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} the artwork is suspected to be in the US and has never been officially declared. The lost artworks from the "Grube Merker," about 450 pictures, are not found in any museum and thought to have been sold privately.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

An attempt by the US to confiscate more German art by requesting 202 precious pictures to be taken was prevented by [[Walter Farmer]] on 6 November 1945, an art protection officer in Wiesbaden leading the central art collection store.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Although against his direct orders from the US, he assembled 24 colleagues from Germany and Austria and successfully prevented the removal of the pictures (named as operation "Westward Ho").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-19438032.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Before his death in 1997, Farmer was awarded Germany's highest civilian honor, the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit, for his work in returning the 202 paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary: Walter Farmer. The Economist; London Vol. 344, Iss. 8031, Anonymous (Aug 23, 1997): 67.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the book ''Art as Politics in the Third Reich'' by [[Jonathan Petropoulos|Jonathan Petropoulus]] he outlines how there is a need for further cooperation by smaller art galleries to recover art that they may be holding and not know who it belongs to. He says that there are still many tens of thousands of pieces of art missing today, but there is still more research to be done to get a more accurate number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art as Politics in the Third Reich|last=Petropoulos|first=Jonathan|publisher=Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large plan was drafted by the Nazis for much of the stolen art to be featured in a so-called [[Fuhrermuseum|Führermuseum]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114537/http://www.artrestitution.at/F.prerogative.html "The Führer’s prerogative and the planned Führer Museum in Linz"] Art Database of the National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism &lt;/ref&gt; which would display much of the art plundered by the Nazis. This museum would feature works that were not considered to be "[[degenerate art]]" and would instead solely focus on the aesthetics that Hitler considered to be "good", and was to be created in the city of [[Linz]]. However, this museum was never created, and much of the art that may have been on display there is still missing today.  The Nazis were so vehemently against the loss of the art that they had plundered for this museum that there was a plan to destroy a stockpile of art saved for the Führermuseum at the [[Altaussee]] salt mines, which held over 12000 pieces of stolen art, using eight 500-kilogram bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Edsel |first1=Robert M. |title=The Monuments Men |date=20 August 2009 |publisher=Hachette/Center Street |isbn=978-1-59995-149-2 |pages=303-306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countless pieces of art were stolen during the Holocaust and many were destroyed.  The Nazis were relentless in their efforts to get rid of the Jewish people and their culture. Paintings that had been passed down from generation to generation were taken and destroyed. This was extremely emotionally hard for many Jewish families because it was not only an attack on their families and culture, but also on their history. There have barely been any efforts of restitution. Many of the families who lost art are simply now left with claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Willi|first1=Korte|title=Nazi Looted Art: The Case of the Missing Perspective|journal=First Person Singular|date=September 1, 2006|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the primary problems encountered by individuals pursuing claims is that it is difficult to locate the necessary documentation on provenance. Organizations with information on a piece's history, museums in particular, often have a disincentive to share information that could assist in an heir's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foulkes|first=Lucia|date=2015|title=The art of atonement: how mandated transparency can help return masterpieces lost during World War II|url=|journal=Boston College International and Comparative Law Review|volume=38|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=Research Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ch'orti' language''' (sometimes also ''Chorti'') is a [[Mayan language]], spoken by the [[Maya peoples|indigenous Maya]] people who are also known as the [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']] or Ch'orti' Maya.  Ch'orti' is a direct descendant of the [[Classic Maya language]] in which many of the [[pre-Columbian]] inscriptions using the [[Maya script]] were written. This Classic Maya language is also attested in a number of inscriptions made in regions whose inhabitants most likely spoke a different Mayan language variant, including the ancestor of [[Yukatek Maya language|Yukatek Maya]]. Ch'orti' is the modern version of the ancient Mayan language Ch'olan (which was actively used and most popular between the years of A.D 250 and 850).&lt;ref&gt;•	Houston, S, J Robertson, and D Stuart. "The language of Classic Maya inscriptions." Current Anthropology 41.3 (2000): 321-356. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other Mayan languages==
Ch’orti’ can be called a living “Rosetta Stone” of Mayan Languages. Ch’orti’ language is an important factor to comprehend the contents of Maya hieroglyphic writings, some of which are not yet fully understood. Over several years, many linguists and anthropologists expected to realize the Ch’orti’ culture and language by studying its words and expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Keys, David. "'Lost' Sacred Language of the Maya Is Rediscovered." Mayanmajix.com. N.p., 07 Dec. 2003. Web page: http://www.mayanmajix.com/art439a.html{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ch'orti' is spoken mainly in and around [[Jocotán]] and [[Camotán]], [[Chiquimula]] department, Guatemala, as well as adjacent areas of parts of western [[Honduras]] near the Copan Ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Kerry M. (2003). Verbal art and performance in Ch'orti' and Maya hieroglyphic writing [electronic resource]. Doctoral dissertation, The University of Texas at Austin. Available electronically from http://hdl.handle.net/2152/1240&lt;/ref&gt; Because the classic Mayan language was ancestral to the modern Ch'orti, Ch'orti can be used to decipher the ancient language. For example, it was discovered that the Mayan language had distinct grammatical patterns, such as a consonant/vowel syllable aspect. Researchers realized that the ancient language was based more on phonetics than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;•	Houston, S, J Robertson, and D Stuart. "The language of Classic Maya inscriptions." Current Anthropology 41.3 (2000): 321-356. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mayan Language Map.png|thumb|A map showing the present-day locations of the Mayan Languages. The colours of the language names shows closely related groups. The size of the name shows the relative number of speakers.]]

The name Chorti' (with unglottalized &lt;ch&gt;) means 'language of the corn farmers' which references to the traditional agricultural activity of the Ch'orti' families.  The politicized spelling Ch'orti' was introduced later in an attempt to lessen associations between Ch'orti' speakers and stereotypical professions.

Ch'orti' language is one of the three modern descendants of Ch’olan language which is a sub-group of [[Mayan languages]]. Other two modern descendants are Ch’ontal and Ch’ol.&lt;ref&gt;Mathews,Peter and Bíró,Péter Maya Hieroglyphs and Mayan Languages.[electronic resource] Available electronically from [http://research.famsi.org/mdp/mdp_mayahiero.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
These three descendants are still spoken by people. Ch’orti’ language and Ch’olti language are two sub-branches belong to the Eastern Ch’olan. And Ch’olti language is already extinct today.

[[File:The Ch'olan sub-group of Mayan languages.jpg|The Ch'olan sub-group of Mayan languages]]

Actually there are some debates among the scholars how the Ch’olan language should be classified. John Robertson considered the direct ancestor of colonial Ch'olti' is the language of the [[hieroglyphs]]. The language of the hieroglyphs is realized as 'Classic Ch'olti'an' by John Robertson, David Stuart, and Stephen Houston. And then the language of the [[hieroglyphs]] in turn becomes the ancestor of Ch’orti’.The relationship shows as the chart below.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Kerry M. (2003).

Available electronically from http://hdl.handle.net/2152/1240&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology and orthography ==

The Ch'orti' have their own standard way of writing their language. However, the inaccurate ways to represent phoneme lead to some variations  among all of the publications recently.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Kerry. (2005) "A Dictionary of Ch'orti' Maya, Guatemala."

Ch'orti' 's consonants include glottal stop ', b, b', ch, ch', d, g, j, k, k', l, m, n, p, r, s, t, t', tz, tz', w, x, y.

Both /b/ and /d/ rarely occur in native vocabulary. Instead, they usually appear in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words.  The &lt;j&gt; is a voiceless velar fricative. The &lt;x&gt; is a voiceless palatal fricative. The &lt;w&gt; and &lt;y&gt; are semivowels.

The ordering of terms would be that the consonants follows after the non glottal versions. Besides, words with rearticulated root vowels follow after their corresponding short vowels.

Therefore, the order of presentation will be as follows: a, a', b, b', ch, ch', d, e, 
e', g, i, i', j, k, k', l, m, n, o, o', p, r, s, t, t', tz, tz', u, u', w, x, y.

=== Word order ===

The aspectual system of Ch'orti' language changed to a tripartite pronominal system which comes with different morphemes used for the subject of transitive verbs, the object of transitive verbs and the subject of intransitive completive verbs, and a third set of pronouns only used for the subject of incompletive intransitive verbs.&lt;ref&gt;Law, Danny, John Robertson, and Stephen Houston.

==Extinction of the language and culture==

The Ch'orti' people are descendants of the people who lived in and around [[Copán]], one of the cultural capitals  of the ancient Maya area. This covers parts of modern-day Honduras and Guatemala. Ch'orti is considered an endangered language as well as an endangered culture.

===Geographic location of Ch'orti' speakers===
[[File:Distribution-myn2.png|thumbnail]]
This region is the only region in the world that Ch'orti speakers can be found. Although the area is completely shaded in, the majority of speakers reside in Guatemala, while the rest are sparsely distributed throughout the rest of the area.&lt;ref&gt;•	McAnany, Patricia, and Shoshaunna Parks. "Casualties of Heritage Distancing Children, Ch'orti' Indigeneity, and the Copan Archaeoscape." Current Anthropology 53.1 (2012): 80-107. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honduras===
The government of Honduras has been trying to promote a uniform national language of Spanish, and therefore discourages the use and teaching of native languages such as Ch'orti. The Ch'orti' people in Honduras face homogenization and have to assimilate to their surroundings. The government has been clashing with the Ch'orti people over land disputes from the 1800s, which puts the people (and thus the language) at risk. In 1997, 2 prominent Ch'orti leaders were assassinated. This assassination is just one example of many cases where Ch'orti advocates have been harmed or killed. Every one of these killings reduces the number of Ch'orti speakers.

===Guatemala===
The government of Guatemala has been more supportive of Ch'orti speakers and has promoted programs that encourage the learning and teaching of Ch'orti. The Ch'orti's in Guatemala wear traditional clothing, unlike their counterparts in Honduras, who wear modern-day clothing.&lt;ref&gt;•	"World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples."

The majority of Ch'orti' live in the Chiquimula Department of Guatemala, approximately 52,000. The remaining 4,000 live in Copán, Honduras. Traditionally, the highland Maya Indian people were dependent on maize and beans. The K'iche' Maya however, dominated the Ch'orti' dating back to the early fifteenth century. Warfare as well as disease devastated much of the Ch'orti' during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Much of their land was lost to the Guatemalan government in the nineteenth century as well. More recently, 25 percent of the Guatemalan Ch'orti' went to the United States during the 1980s to escape political persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Chenier, Jacqueline, and Steve Sherwood.

== Copan ==
The communities of Copan are populated by "farmers with indigenous tradition", essentially, agricultural laborers known as the Ch'orti'. Illiteracy rates in these communities fall between 92 and 100 percent, infant mortality rates of 60 percent, and life expectancy being 49 years for men and 55 years for women. A conflict that has effected the Copan area immensely is land tenure. 
Originally, Ch'orti's used communal land and owned individual plots. Shortly after the Spanish conquest, the land and people became Spanish property. The land was then used in the aparceria system (farmers rent land in return for payment of a proportion of the harvest obtained). This system was stable for hundreds of years, until the Honduran government signed Convention 169 of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 1991. This organization was established to protect and benefit indigenous communities such as the Ch'orti' by improving access to land, health, and housing as well as other basic necessities. The murder of Ch'orti leader Candido Amador in April 1997 sparked another conflict, resulting in the government signing an agreement with the Ch'orti' organization (CONICHH) offering 2,000 ha of land in Copan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srdis.ciesin.columbia.edu/cases/Honduras-Paper.html Copan: Collaboration for Identity, Equity and Sustainability (Honduras)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201833/http://srdis.ciesin.columbia.edu/cases/Honduras-Paper.html |date=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clarissa Caldwell Lathrop''' (1847 – September 11, 1892) was an American social reformer and autobiographer.{{sfn|Davis|1989|p=151}} Her prominence came from her remarkable experience, being confined and unlawfully imprisoned in the [[Utica Lunatic Asylum]] for 26 months (October 1880 – December 1882),{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=75}} through a plot of a secret enemy to kill her. She eventually managed to communicate with [[James Bailey Silkman]], a lawyer who, like herself, was confined in the same asylum under similar circumstances. He succeeded in obtaining a [[writ]] of ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and Judge [[George G. Barnard]] of the [[New York Supreme Court]] pronounced Lathrop sane and unlawfully incarcerated.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=598}}

After that time, she devoted her life to ameliorating the laws relating to lunacy.{{sfn|American Woman Suffrage Association|1892|p=170}} Lathrop felt she owed it to women to take her case before the [[New York State Legislature]], and demand reform in this direction, but she was unsuccessful in two efforts and found herself penniless and facing the need to support herself. After several efforts, she became a [[court stenographer]], and ten years after her release, wrote a book, the story of her own institutionalization, entitled ''[[A Secret Institution]].'' Published at her own expense,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; this book led to the formation of the Lunacy Law Reform League, in 1889, a national organization with headquarters in [[New York City]], of which Lathrop became the secretary and was the national organizer.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=598}}

==Early years and education==
Clarissa Caldwell Lathrop was born in [[Rochester, New York]]. She was a daughter of Gen. William E. Lathrop, a Brigadier General of the National Guard. Lathrop’s father had met and married Lathrop’s mother, Jemima, at the age of 42 – Jemima was only 19.  Lathrop had been one of five children, but had lost her eldest brother to disease in 1865 and her second eldest brother moved to the southern part of the country to look for work.  Lathrop’s father passed away in 1877 leaving his wife, and his three daughters to open their home to board strangers for income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She graduated from the Rochester Academy.

Lathrop also often traveled significant distances and visited friends around Rochester.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=Chapter II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Teacher===
Lathrop became a teacher, which, owing to her father's failure in business, became a means of support to her family as well as to herself. She continued to teach successfully until her unlawful imprisonment in the Utica State Hospital (formerly known as the New York State Lunatic Asylum at Utica).{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nysasylum.com/utica/ushhist.htm|title=Utica State Hospital|website=nysasylum.com|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utica Lunatic Asylum incarceration and release===
Lathrop feared that Miss Hamlo, a boarder in her mother's house, was poisoning her. Lathrop was obsessed with a Mr. Zell, a former lover who married another woman after Lathrop rejected him. After repenting her decision to reject Zell, Lathrop became convinced that Hamlo was in alliance with Zell's wife. After Lathrop began seeing Zell eveywhere, she believed he had divorced, and would now marry her if Lathrop survived Hamlo's poisonings.{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=75}} When Lathrop's life was saved on two occasions by friends, she took some of the [[Aconitine|aconite]]-poisoned tea to a chemist for analysis, as she sought reliable proof before making open charges against any one. At the instigation of a doctor who was in sympathy with the plot to incarcerate Lathrop, she went to Utica to consult Dr. [[John P. Gray (psychiatrist)|John P. Gray]], Superintendent of the State Lunatic Asylum in [[Utica, New York]]. Instead of seeing Grey, upon her arrival, she was incarcerated with the insane, without the commitment papers required by law, and kept a prisoner at the asylum for 26 months.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}

She was sent to the asylum at the insistence of her mother and sisters, who lived in Rochester, and who asserted that Lathrop was suffering from the delusion that somebody was trying to poison her. Her answer was that it was not a delusion, that somebody was endeavoring to poison her. But she was willing to accept proof to the contrary, which was also evidence that there was no delusion. Nonetheless, her incarceration ensued.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;  By the time Lathrop was admitted to the asylum, she was 32 years old and unmarried despite engagements to two different men.  Her first engagement was broken off by her fiancé due to cold feet and her second betrothed died from consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The hospital, according to Lathrop was “a living tomb.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few weeks of her arrival at Utica, Lathrop had written letters to two of her physician friends only to find out later that her letters had never been mailed.  The attending physician claimed they were not sent because the asylum was not obliged to send her letters “all over the country.”  Lathrop was “amazed and dumbfounded” at the idea that not only would her letters be read by the asylum doctors, but that they would never reach their intended destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lathrop had easily made a friend who had revealed to her how she would be able to communicate to the outside world without getting caught by the authorities. She obtained paper through another patient who had hidden the contraband in her room. The woman would not out rightly give the paper to Lathrop for fear of punishment for aiding and abetting, but hinted that there was nothing she could do if Lathrop took a page or two while she was elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lathrop also wrote on newspaper edges and scraps of wrapping paper which she also hid in her skirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Secret Institution|last=Lathrop|first=Clarissa Caldwell|publisher=Bryant Publishing Co.|year=1890|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, she managed to communicate with Silkman, a New York lawyer, who had been forcibly carried off and imprisoned in the same insane asylum. He obtained a writ of ''habeas corpus'' at once on behalf of Lathrop, and in December, 1882, Judge Barnard of the New York Supreme Court pronounced Lathrop to be sane and unlawfully incarcerated.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}

===Social reformer and autobiographer===
Immediately upon her release, Lathrop went before the New York State Legislature. She described her experience and the necessity for reform. After making another fruitless effort the succeeding year, she found herself homeless and penniless, and dependent upon a cousin's generosity for shelter and support, forced to begin her new life under the most difficult circumstances.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}}[[File:A Secret Institution (1890).png|thumb|''A Secret Institution'' (1890)]]
Lathrop collected money for a charitable society on a commission, spending her evenings studying stenography and typewriting. She soon started a business of her own and was successful as a [[court stenographer]]. Ten years after her release, she wrote her book, ''A Secret Institution'', which was a history of her own life, written in the style of a novel, and descriptive of what she experienced or witnessed while an inmate of the Utica asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXEEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA450#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Woman of the Century: Fourteen Hundred-seventy Biographical Sketches Accompanied by Portraits of Leading American Women in All Walks of Life|last=Willard|first=Frances Elizabeth|last2=Livermore|first2=Mary Ashton Rice|date=1893|publisher=Moulton|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeping true to her vow “to devote the rest of [her] life to the cause of the insane,” Lathrop formed the Lunacy Law Reform and the Anti-Kidnapping Leagues.  The Leagues provided legal services to asylum patients who felt they were victims of a corrupt legal system. The goal of the leagues was to “protect sane people from false imprisonment.”  Both groups had helped several individuals who had been unjustly incarcerated secure their freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Obituary|last=|first=|date=September 13, 1892|work=The New York Times Herald|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lunacy Law Reform League in 1889, was a national organization having its headquarters in [[New York City]], of which she was secretary and national organizer.
{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=451}} Lathrop spoke out against asylum abuses, and became a spokesperson for others incarcerated as insane.{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=67}} She lived with self-doubt, fear, and suspicion, while trying to understand how incarceration affected her. She struggled with society's perceptions of her mental stability.{{sfn|Wood|1994|p=68}}

Lathrop died in [[Saratoga, New York]], on September 11, 1892,{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=450}} and is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery, in Rochester.

==Legal case==
Albert Bach, legal counsel to Lathrop, held that the interesting point in the case was the question of the deprivation of Lathrop's postal rights while in the asylum. She was not permitted to have writing materials, and even though she succeeded in obtaining them, the asylum authorities disposed of her letters as they pleased. The claim was asserted that asylum managers have no such control over inmates as have prison managers; that the former institutions have more of the character of hospitals. Bach found nothing in the by-laws of the Utica asylum giving the right to this close supervision. He said that there were many instances of wrongful incarceration, and that justice would seem to dictate that inmates of asylums should have access to the mails. Even though much of it would be trash, it would be well worth while to endure that if information could be obtained to the release of a person improperly detained.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Will sue the aslym; Miss Lathrop alleges that she was wrongfully incarcerated.|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/12/20/103287284.pdf|accessdate=11 September 2017|work=The New York Times|date=20 December 1890|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports suggested that Lathrop would bring a suit of U$25,000 damages against the management of the Utica State Insane Asylum. The grounds alleged were the wrongful detention of herself, and the seizure of her letters written to friends asking them to help her to regain her liberty. Lathrop’s lawyer gave the following statement of the scope of the lawsuit: &lt;blockquote&gt;Of course the main point is in regard to the interception of letters that she wrote to friends asking for assistance. If the managers of the asylums have the right to intercept letters, they have the power to shut a person entirely from the world, whether the person be insane or not. This is a difference between a criminal and a lunatic. In the case of a criminal he is in his position through his own fault, but the insane person is a patient, and deserves all possible consideration. If they stop a person’s letters, they virtually remove from that person the possibility of obtaining release. The suit is brought not so much for the sake of damages, as to test the point whether or not the managers of asylums have a right to enforce such a rule. I have become interested in the matter, and intend to follow it up and test the question thoroughly. One of the things I will do will be to write to the Postmaster General, asking if it would not be advisable in case we can prove that the authorities are wrong in prohibiting the forwarding of letters, to place free delivery boxes in all asylums, that the patients may have a chance to correspond without difficulty with their friends. I believe such a system would do away with much of the abuse that without doubt exists in many asylums, and would greatly lessen the chance of sane persons being held in confinement.{{sfn|Jerdone|1891|p=59}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Diane Alexis Whipple''' (January 21, 1968 – January 26, 2001) was a [[lacrosse]] player and college coach.  She was killed in a [[dog attack]] in [[San Francisco]] on January 26, 2001. The dogs involved were two [[Perro de Presa Canario|Presa Canario]]s: a male named Bane and a female named Hera.  Paul Schneider, the dogs' owner, is a high-ranking member of the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and is serving a life sentence in state prison. The dogs were cared for by Schneider's husband-and-wife attorneys, Robert Noel and Marjorie Knoller, who lived in the same apartment building as Diane Whipple.  After the fatal attack, the state brought criminal charges against the attorneys.  Robert Noel, who was not present during the attack, was convicted of [[manslaughter]].  Marjorie Knoller, who was present, was charged with [[malice (law)|implied-malice]] second-degree [[murder]] and convicted by the jury. Knoller's murder conviction, an unusual result for an unintended dog attack, was rejected by the trial judge but ultimately upheld.  The case clarified the meaning of implied malice murder.

== Victim ==

Whipple was born in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. She grew up and attended high school in [[Manhasset, New York]], on [[Long Island]]. She was raised primarily by her grandparents, and was a gifted athlete from a young age. She became a two-time [[All-America]]n lacrosse player in high school, and later at [[Penn State]].  She was twice a member of the U.S. [[Women's Lacrosse World Cup]] team.

Whipple later moved to San Francisco, and came within seconds of qualifying for the U.S. [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]] team in [[track and field]], for the 800 meters. However, she did not compete at the 1996 Olympic Team Trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usatf.org/news/wot96.asp |title=1996 Olympic Team Trials - Women |publisher=USA Track &amp; Field}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became the lacrosse coach at [[Saint Mary's College of California]] in [[Moraga, California]].{{When|date=April 2014}}

At the time of her death, Whipple lived in San Francisco's [[Pacific Heights]] with her [[domestic partner]] of six years, Sharon Smith.&lt;ref name=advocate1&gt;{{cite web |title=Justice for Sharon: the dog-mauling trial ended with guilty verdicts, but for Sharon Smith, partner to the woman killed, another legal battle is about to begin |work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |date=2002-04-30 |first=Dan |last=Allen |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1589/is_2002_April_30/ai_85281811 |accessdate=2007-06-25}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perpetrators ==

'''Marjorie Fran Knoller''' (born c. 1956) and '''Robert Edward Noel''' (born c. 1942) were [[Attorney at law|attorneys]] married to each other. They were caregivers to the dogs that killed Diane Whipple in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] on January 26, 2001.  After a trial that attracted international attention, they were sent to prison for involuntary [[manslaughter]].  However on August 22, 2008, San Francisco Judge Charlotte Woolard reinstated Knoller's [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/22/BAJC12GPD1.DTL&amp;tsp=1] second degree murder conviction.

As Knoller was reported to be 46 years old in 2002,&lt;ref name=Derbeken1/&gt; she was born c.1956. After attending [[Brooklyn College]],&lt;ref name=Costantinou&gt;Costantinou, Marianne.

As Noel was reported to be 60 years old in 2002,&lt;ref name=Derbeken1/&gt; he was born c.1942. He  "graduated from the [[University of Baltimore]] Law School in 1967."&lt;ref name=Derbeken1/&gt;

The two were married in 1989.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; Starting in the mid-1990s, Noel and Knoller ran "their law office... out of a converted closet in their [[Pacific Heights, San Francisco, California|Pacific Heights]] apartment" in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;144)&lt;/sup&gt;

In 2000, Knoller and Noel "obtained their two [[Presa Canario]]s, named Bane and Hera, through their relationship with a pair of [[Pelican Bay State Prison]] inmates, Paul 'Cornfed' Schneider (who they had legally adopted as their son) and Dale Bretches, members of the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] prison gang."&lt;ref name=Derbeken1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Costantinou/&gt; Knoller and Noel had first met Schneider at a trial.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;148)&lt;/sup&gt; Bane was male and Hera female; by January 2001, "Bane weighed 140 pounds and Hera close to 100 pounds."&lt;ref name=Lockyer&gt;Lockyer, Bill, et al.

Warren, Judge. April 11, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events of January 26, 2001 ==

Although because of his larger size Noel "usually handled Bane," Knoller "was home alone with the dogs" on January 26, 2001, and "Bane had to go out," so "she decided to take Bane up to the roof, just one flight up the stairs."&lt;ref name=Costantinou/&gt; Diane Whipple was "returning from a trip to the grocery store" when Bane and possibly Hera attacked her in the hallway.&lt;ref name=Derbeken1/&gt; (Hera's "role in the mauling has never been firmly established."&lt;ref name=Derbeken1/&gt; There was "no way to prove or disprove" that Hera participated in the attack on Whipple; however, "Hera had parts of Diane [Whipple]'s clothes in her feces," and "experts and authorities speculated that the bites on Whipple's inner thighs had most probably come from Hera."&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(pp.&amp;nbsp;277–278)&lt;/sup&gt;.)

== Aftermath ==

Bane "was destroyed immediately after the attack"; Hera was seized and destroyed in January 2002.&lt;ref name=Derbeken1/&gt;

On January 29, 2001, "Knoller and Noel formally adopt[ed] Schneider, who [was] serving a life sentence for aggravated assault and attempted murder."&lt;ref name=Derbeken1/&gt; It was reported that "even their relatives [were] at a loss to understand" the adoption.&lt;ref name=Costantinou/&gt;

In March 2001, a [[grand jury]] indicted Knoller and Noel.&lt;ref name=Chiu&gt;Chiu, Alexis. Grand Jury Indicts Two in Fatal S.F. Dog Mauling. 2nd-Degree Murder, Manslaughter Among Charges Husband, Wife Face. ''San Jose Mercury News'', March 28, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Knoller was indicted for second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, Noel was indicted for involuntary manslaughter, and "both also face[d] felony charges of keeping a mischievous dog."&lt;ref name=Chiu/&gt;

The trial by jury, which began in January 2002, "was moved to Los Angeles because of extensive publicity in the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]."&lt;ref name=Chmielewski1/&gt; Among other aspects, the trial was notable for:
* The participation of [[Kimberly Guilfoyle]] as "second chair" to lead prosecutor James Hammer.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;211)&lt;/sup&gt;
* Opening arguments by Knoller's defense attorney Nedra Ruiz in which she "kicked the jury box, yelled and got down on her hands and knees to re-enact what she described as Knoller's attempts to protect Whipple from the [[dog attack]]."&lt;ref name=Derbeken2&gt;Van Derbeken, Jaxon.

* Knoller's testimony, which included claims that she "attempt[ed] to protect Whipple," that "she... kicked on a neighbor's door for help," and that "12 of 13 incidents recounted by earlier witnesses of attacks by the couple's dogs" had not occurred.&lt;ref name=Chmielewski1/&gt; Prosecutor Hammer attempted "to puncture holes" in this testimony.&lt;ref name=Chmielewski1/&gt;
* "National and international press" coverage (e.g., in "Japan, England, and Australia"), with a "media circus" atmosphere, and a "flood" of talk in Internet [[chat room]]s about the case.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(pp.&amp;nbsp;287–289,293)&lt;/sup&gt;

The jury convicted Knoller and Noel on all counts in March 2002.&lt;ref name=Derbeken1/&gt; Knoller became "the first person ever to be convicted of murder in a dog-mauling case in California."&lt;ref name=Derbeken1/&gt; Jurors interviewed after the trial said that Knoller's testimony was "not believable."&lt;ref name=Derbeken1/&gt;

In April 2002, Knoller replaced her attorney Nedra Ruiz with attorney Dennis Riordan.&lt;ref name=Derbeken2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Derbeken3&gt;Van Derbeken, Jaxon.

Noel was sentenced in June 2002 "to the four-year maximum term" for involuntary manslaughter.&lt;ref name=Derbeken3/&gt; He was sent to [[Deuel Vocational Institution]] but was later moved to Oregon because of "concerns that his having represented inmates and prison guards in California might jeopardize his safety."&lt;ref name=Zamora&gt;Zamora, Jim Herron.

The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the prison gang the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] who was serving a life sentence in [[Pelican Bay State Prison]]. Schneider and his cellmate Dale Bretches were attempting to start an illegal Presa Canario dog-fighting business from prison. They initially asked acquaintances Janet Coumbs and Hard Times Kennel owner/breeder James Kolber of [[Akron, Ohio]] to raise the dogs during their incarceration. Against Kolber's advice, Coumbs chained the dogs in a remote corner of the farm, which caused them to become even more aggressive. After Coumbs fell out of favor with Schneider,&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt; attorneys Noel and Knoller agreed to take possession of the dogs. They had become acquainted with Schneider while doing legal work for prisoners, and had adopted Schneider (then age 38) as their legal son a few days before the mauling. Bane, the larger of the dogs, weighed {{convert|140|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name="Lockyer"&gt;Lockyer, Bill, et al.

Warren, Judge. April 11, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just prior to the attack, Knoller was taking the dogs up to the roof;&lt;ref name="Costantinou"/&gt; Bane {{ndash}} and possibly Hera {{ndash}} attacked Whipple in the hallway.&lt;ref name="Derbeken1" /&gt; (Hera's role in the mauling has never been firmly established.) Whipple suffered a total of 77 wounds to every part of her body except her scalp and bottoms of her feet. Another neighbor called 911 after hearing Whipple's screams.&lt;ref name="Chmielewski2"/&gt; Whipple died hours later at [[San Francisco General Hospital]] from "loss of blood from multiple traumatic injuries (dog bite wounds)".&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

Bane was [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]] immediately after the attack; Hera was seized and later euthanized in January 2002.&lt;ref name="Derbeken1" /&gt;

Whipple's memorial service at St. Mary's College, held on Thursday, February 1, 2001, was attended by more than 400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Kurt Streeter|title=Dog Victim's Passion for Games, Life Recalled Funeral: Diane Whipple's friends and family remember her as a coach and competitor.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/02/news/mn-20041|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=11 August 2014|date=2 February 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal proceedings against dog owners ==

In March 2001, a [[grand jury]] indicted Knoller and Noel. Knoller was indicted for second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, Noel was indicted for involuntary manslaughter, and "both also face[d] felony charges of keeping a mischievous dog".&lt;ref name="Chiu"/&gt;

At trial, Knoller argued that she had attempted to defend Whipple during the attack.  However, witnesses testified that Knoller and Noel had repeatedly refused to control the dogs; a professional dog walker testified that, after she told Noel to muzzle his dogs, he told her to "shut up" and called her offensive names. An acquaintance of Noel's testified that Noel did not apologize after Hera bit him a year before the fatal attack.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Derbeken2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chmielewski1"&gt;Chmielewski, Dawn C. "Testimony Is Challenged - The Prosecutor Disputes Details from Marjorie Knoller, Saying She has Been Inconsistent in Her Accounts in Court and to the S.F. Grand Jury About Efforts to Save Diane Whipple." ''San Jose Mercury News'', March 13, 2002.&lt;sup&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;211)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the jury found both Noel and Knoller guilty of involuntary manslaughter and owning a mischievous animal that caused the death of a human being, and found Knoller guilty of second-degree murder. Their convictions were based on the argument that they knew the dogs were aggressive towards other people and that they did not take sufficient precautions. Whether they had actually trained the dogs to attack and fight remained unclear.&lt;ref name="Derbeken1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zamora"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webby, Sean. "Judge Sentences S.F. Woman to 4 Years for Fatal Mauling - Maximum Term for Neighbor's Death." ''San Jose Mercury News'', July 16, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matier2003"/&gt;

Although the jury found Knoller guilty of second degree murder, trial judge James Warren granted Knoller a new trial on the second-degree murder conviction; the judge believed the appropriate standard for implied malice murder required that Knoller knew taking the dog into the hall involved a high probability of death. Although the judge granted a new trial for the second degree murder charge, he sentenced Knoller to four years in prison for the lesser-included involuntary manslaughter on 15 July 2002.&lt;ref name="Mintz" /&gt;  Manslaughter and murder are exclusive: one cannot be convicted of both manslaughter and murder for killing the same person. The state appealed the judge's action and sought to reinstate the second degree murder conviction.&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt;

After Knoller's and Noel's convictions in 2002, the [[State Bar of California]] suspended their law licenses.&lt;ref name="Lagos"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;State Bar of California. [http://members.calbar.ca.gov/search/member_detail.aspx?x=158054 "Marjorie Fran Knoller - #158054."] Retrieved December 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Noel was [[Disbarment|disbarred]] in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;State Bar of California. [http://members.calbar.ca.gov/search/member_detail.aspx?x=68477 "Robert Edward Noel - #68477."] Retrieved December 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2003, Noel was released from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephanie |last=Chuang |url=https://www.google.com/amp/www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/San-Francisco-Dog-Mauling-Federal-Court-Owner-Marjorie-Knoller-Seeks-to-Overturn-Conviction-350638111.html%3famp=y|title=Dog Owner Seeks to Overturn Conviction in 2001 Mauling Death |work=NBC Bay Area |date=November 16, 2015 |accessdate=October 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charlie |last=Goodyear |url=https://www.google.com/amp/www.sfgate.com/bayarea/amp/Dog-maul-case-figure-paroled-Robert-Noel-2588703.php%3famp=y  |title=Dog-maul case figure paroled / Robert Noel released early from prison |work=SFgate |date=September 15, 2003 |accessdate=October 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2004, both Knoller and Noel had served their terms for the manslaughter convictions, and Knoller was out on [[bail]] while her second-degree murder conviction was under [[appeal]].

In May 2005, the state appellate court reversed the judge's grant of new second-degree murder trial for Knoller.  The appellate court ruled that implied malice murder did not require knowledge of a high probability of death but rather just a conscious disregard of serious bodily injury.&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt;  The appellate court returned the case to the lower court to reconsider Knoller's motion for a new trial using the serious bodily injury standard for implied malice murder.&lt;ref name="Kennard"&gt;[http://www.lawlink.com/research/CaseLevel3/11206 ''People v Knoller''], 41 Cal. 4th 139 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Knoller appealed the appellate court decision to the [[Supreme Court of California]].&lt;ref name="Lockyer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egelko, Bob. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/05/06/BAGC8CL3OM1.DTL "Jury's verdict reinstated in dog mauling. State appeals court overrules judge who reduced conviction."] ''San Francisco Chronicle'', May 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2007, the California Supreme Court rejected the Court of Appeal's decision and ruled that implied malice murder required proof that a defendant acted with "conscious disregard" of the danger to human life.&lt;ref name="Kennard" /&gt;  The Supreme Court held that the trial court's standard for implied malice murder (which required a high probabily of death) was too strict and the appellate court's standard (which required only serious bodily injury rather than a danger to human life) was too broad. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the trial court to reconsider whether to allow the second-degree murder conviction to stand in light of this new reasoning.&lt;ref name="Egelko2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/sfdogattack/caknoller53107opn.html "California Supreme Court Sends Murder Conviction in S.F. Dog Attack Case Back To The Trial Court Using The Correct Test For Implied Malice."] ''California v. Marjorie Knoller'', May 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The San Francisco Superior Court reinstated the conviction for second-degree murder, and on September 22, 2008, the court sentenced Knoller to 15 years to life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202424717879 "Knoller Gets 15 to Life in Dog-Mauling Case"]- law.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kwes.com/global/story.asp?s=13032650 {{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knoller then appealed the trial court's actions.

On August 23, 2010, the First District Court of Appeal unanimously upheld Knoller's conviction, finding that she acted with a conscious disregard for human life when her Presa Canario escaped and killed Whipple. The California Supreme Court declined to hear her appeal of that decision. Knoller is currently serving her sentence at [[Valley State Prison for Women]] in [[Chowchilla, California|Chowchilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2010/12/01/high-court-denies-appeal-in-san-francisco-dog-mauling-case/|title=High Court Rejects Appeal In Fatal San Francisco Dog Mauling Case|date=2010-12-01|publisher=cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Knoller petitioned the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] to overturn her second-degree murder conviction.&lt;ref name="Mintz"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mintz |first=Howard |date=November 15, 2015 |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_29121277/fatal-san-francisco-dog-maul-case-back-spotlight |title=Fatal San Francisco dog maul case back in spotlight |journal=San Jose Mercury News |access-date=2015-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the Ninth Circuit upheld Knoller's second degree murder conviction.&lt;ref&gt;https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/memoranda/2016/02/03/14-16449.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=San Jose Mercury News |title=San Francisco Fatal Dog Mauling Conviction Upheld |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_29480634/san-francisco-fatal-dog-mauling-conviction-upheld |access-date=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whipple's partner, Sharon Smith, also succeeded in suing Knoller and Noel for $1,500,000 in civil damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/11/15/fatal-san-francisco-dog-maul-case-back-in-spotlight/|title=Fatal San Francisco dog maul case back in spotlight|date=2015-11-15|publisher=mercurynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She donated some of the money to [[Saint Mary's College of California]] to fund the women's lacrosse team.

{{Capitalism|Concepts}}
A '''free price system''' or '''free price mechanism''' (informally called ''the price system'' or ''the price mechanism'') is a mechanism of resource allocation that relies upon [[Money|monetary prices]] set by the interchange of [[supply and demand]]. The resulting prices serve as ''[[price signal|signal]]s'' communicated between producers and consumers which serve to guide the production and distribution of resources. Through the free price system, supplies are rationed, income is distributed, and resources are allocated. 

A free price system contrasts with a [[Administered price|fixed price system]] where prices are administered by [[government]] in a [[controlled market]]. The price system, whether ''free'' or controlled, contrasts with physical and non-monetary [[economic planning]].

==Mechanics of a free price system==
[[Image:PriceFreedom.svg|thumb|left|300px|A diagram presenting the argument for free prices]]
Rather than prices being set by the state, as in a [[command economy]] with a ''fixed price system'', prices are determined in a decentralized fashion by trades that occur as a result of sellers' ''asking prices'' matching buyers' ''bid prices'' as a result of [[subjective theory of value|subjective value judgement]] in a [[market economy]]. Since resources of consumers are limited at any given time, consumers are relegated to satisfying wants in a descending hierarchy and bidding prices relative to the urgency of a variety of wants. This information on relative values is communicated, through ''[[price signal]]s'', to producers whose resources are also limited. In turn, relative prices for the productive services are established. The interchange of these two sets of prices establish market value, and serve to guide the rationing of resources, distributing income, and allocating resources.

Those goods which command the highest prices (when summed among all individuals) provide an incentive for businesses to provide these goods in a corresponding descending hierarchy of priority. However, the ordering of this hierarchy of wants is not constant. Consumer preferences change. When consumer preferences for a good increase, then bidding pressure raises the price for a particular good as it moves to a higher position in the hierarchy. As a result of higher prices for this good, more productive forces are applied to satisfying the demand driven by the opportunity for higher profits in satisfying this new consumer preference. In other words, the high price sends a ''price signal'' to producers. This causes producers to increase supply, either by the same firms increasing production or new businesses coming into the market, which eventually lowers the price and the profit incentive to increase supplies. Hence, the now lower price provides a price signal to producers to decrease production and, as a result, a surplus is prevented. Since resources are scarce (including labor and capital), supplies of other goods will be diminished as the productive resources are taken from other areas of production to be applied toward increasing output of the good that has risen in the hierarchy of consumer preferences. Also, as resources become more scarce the price increases, which signals to consumers to reduce consumption thereby ensuring that the quantity demanded does not exceed the quantity supplied. It is in this way that the free price system persuades consumers to ration dwindling resources. Hence, supply and demand affect price, while at the same time price affects supply and demand. If prices remain high because increases in supply cannot keep pace with demand, then this also signals other business to provide substitute goods in order to take advantage of profit opportunities.

Individual employments and incomes are also guided by the price system. Employment will move toward those goods and services that consumers value and away from those with declining importance to consumers as a result of changes in prices.

== History ==

=== First wave of migration ===
The first wave of French immigrants to arrive in Cuba were fleeing the [[Haitian Revolution]] and the new governmental administration of Haiti after independence was declared. This immigration reached its peak between 1800 and 1809, when more than twenty-seven thousand French of all social classes arrived in the eastern part of Cuba. Many of them emigrated to the city of Santiago de Cuba, which had neither sidewalks nor paved streets, and lacked drinking water, supplies and dwellings for the refugees.

The newcomers soon recognized the favorable conditions the new land presented. Initially, they worked in the port, and traded with the [[Catalan people|Catalan]]s who had settled in Santiago. Consequently, the port of Santiago de Cuba saw much more commercial activity. With the resultant increase of the white population of the city, for the first time it had a relative balance between the black and the white populations. An [[apothecary]] and shops selling imported [[comestible]]s were opened, new government buildings were built, and postal service was expanded.

The [[Captaincy General of Cuba]] of the island approved the growing of coffee and many French-Haitian migrants were used for work in the coffee fields, especially those white French who were considered "solvent and reliable". By 1804 there were three thousand men cultivating the land, and agricultural lands were bought, sold and resold while Creole and French investors provided capital for new business ventures that became the economic engine of Santiago.

In 1807, coffee shipped to the United States and Spain was the principal Cuban export. [[Sebastián Kindelán y O’Regan]], governor of Santiago, reported five hundred thousand coffee plants being cultivated on the island; the crop's yield of ten million pounds that year would be quadrupled in 1810. The beginning of the [[Peninsular War]] (1807–1814) between France and Spain caused the Captaincy General of the island to expel Franco-Haitian and French residents, and only those French who were naturalized Spanish citizens and had assimilated into the Spanish culture were allowed to remain. The exact number of French persons expelled from Santiago de Cuba is unknown, most of them moved to the southern United States, especially Louisiana.

=== Second, third and fourth waves of migration ===
In 1814, when peace between France and Spain was restored, the French immigrants who had left Cuba were allowed to return to the island. They, together with new French immigrants, formed a second wave of French immigration to Santiago de Cuba.

This second wave promoted an increase in economic activity in the city, and resulted in Santiago becoming a prime exporter of coffee. Sugarcane-raising expanded in the surrounding [[savanna]]s, while new roads and aqueducts were built to encourage the settling of the [[Sierra Maestra]].

Between 1818 and 1835 a third wave of immigration to Santiago de Cuba occurred, prompted by a royal order from the Spanish Crown intended to increase the proportion of whites in the Cuban population. While only a quarter of the population were engaged in agriculture, commercial activities were much more robust than before.

Since 1821, only a few years after a treaty was signed in 1817 between Spain and England to abolish the slave trade, this trade had nevertheless increased, and increased exports of sugar, honey, wax, coffee, tobacco and rum made the port of Santiago one of Cuba's busiest. With French investment in exploiting the mines in the area, mining had become a new and important sector in the city's economic development. With the general increase in mercantile activity, many new shops of all sorts were opened and tradesmen found a larger market for their products or labor.

The fourth and final wave of French immigrants to Santiago de Cuba occurred between 1836 and 1868. In this period over 2200 French settlers emigrated, most of them coming from the Atlantic coast of France. The local economy was strengthened while the immigrants were absorbed into traditional occupations. In 1851, a French-owned [[steamship]] line was inaugurated to improve communications between Santiago de Cuba and New York City.

The civil engineer Jules Sagebien, a French immigrant from [[Picardy]], after making a trip to Europe to learn engineering techniques for the building of railroads, did some technically challenging work for the Santiago de Cuba Railroad, which traverses rugged mountainous terrain.&lt;ref name="Rielo2009"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Rodolfo Zamora Rielo |title=Revista Opus Habana - La historia cubana de Jules Sagebien |url=http://www.opushabana.cu/index.php/noticias/58-flaschazo/flaschazo/1743- |website=www.opushabana.cu |publisher=Revista Opus Habana |accessdate=31 October 2018 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20160121212250/http://opushabana.cu/index.php/noticias/58-flaschazo/flaschazo/1743- |archivedate=21 January 2016 |language=es-es |date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1844, he surveyed the Santiago-Cobre line built to transport ore from the island's only copper mine to the port of Santiago,&lt;ref name="LecuonaAlvarez1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Oscar Zanetti Lecuona|author2=Alejandro García Alvarez|title=Sugar &amp; Railroads: A Cuban History, 1837-1959|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIgCag5WZI0C&amp;pg=PA131|year=1998|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-4692-6|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; a railway project for the Eastern Department, the first of its kind in the region, according to historian Laura Cruz Ríos.&lt;ref name="Ríos2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Cruz Ríos|title=Flujos inmigratorios franceses a Santiago de Cuba: (1800-1868)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XDh7AAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Editorial Oriente|isbn=978-959-11-0515-8|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Coffee remained the number one crop in the Santiago de Cuba region, exceeding the sugar cane crop in value, until it reached its highest production in the 1840s. Towards the end of this decade, however, coffee production began to decline with the bankruptcy of some of the large landowners; investors then began to direct their capital into copper mining and sugar production. The French still had a presence in diverse sectors of the Cuban economy throughout the 19th century, especially in commercial trade, but also in agriculture, marine shipping, and the [[profession]]s, including medicine, engineering, law, and pedagogy.

== Demography ==

The number of Cubans of French ancestry remains unknown. In some historical works, the number of French emigrants to Cuba is reported to be over 60,000 during the Haitian Revolution. In those days the total population of Cuba was less than 1,000,0000 and the proportion of whites to blacks was about 50% whites and 50% blacks. This meant that 10–12% of whites were French refugees.  On 1 May 2012, the number of registered residents in the French Consulate record was 534, two thirds of them residing in Havana. They were primarily officials of the French Embassy, the Alliance Française and their families, and French expatriates working for French companies operating in Cuba and their families.&lt;ref name="ComunidadFrancesa2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=La comunidad francesa en algunas cifras |url=https://cu.ambafrance.org/La-comunidad-francesa-en-algunas |website=cu.ambafrance.org |publisher=French Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=31 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://web.archive.org/web/20170505153405/https://cu.ambafrance.org/La-comunidad-francesa-en-algunas|archivedate=5 May 2017|language=Spanish translated to English |date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2499">'''Gaeltarra Éireann''' ({{IPA-ga|ˈɡeːl̪ˠt̪ˠaɾˠa ˈeːɾʲən̪ˠ}}, meaning "Gaelic Coal-tar of Ireland") was an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] state industrial development agency set up in 1957 specifically for the [[Gaeltacht]], the [[Irish language|Irish]] speaking areas of Ireland. Gaeltarra Éireann followed on from [[Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs|the dedicated government department]] that had been initiated to coordinate Gaeltacht affairs when the new boundaries were drawn up for the reduced size Gaeltacht in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coimisineir.ie/index.php?page=faoin_teanga&amp;lang=english&amp;tid=23 An Coimisinéir Teanga, ''Protecting language rights''] (retrieved 11 October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gaeltarra's approach to the task at hand was centered on the belief that there had to be some sort of an urban focus in the Gaeltacht. Something that would attract inward industrial investment and keep young people in the area. It created two major industrial estates, one at [[Derrybeg|Na Doirí Beaga]] in northwestern [[County Donegal]], and another around [[Spiddal|An Spidéal]] in southwestern [[County Galway]]. Initially, this was controversial, as [[Crolly|Croithlí]] (Donegal) and [[Tuar Mhic Éadaigh]] (Mayo) already had successful industries, and were established economic bases. Gaeltarra Éireann stated that it picked these two locations as they were, according to the census, the strongest districts linguistically (in terms of Irish), and they sought to "raise the flag" as it were and possibly encourage other people in slightly weaker Gaeltacht areas to continue to speak the language. In terms of creating jobs these schemes were relatively successful. They attracted business into small rural communities on the western fringes of Europe, in areas that had previously been suffering from a long-term economic decline and depopulation.

However, it is now viewed that despite all this Gaeltarra Éireann failed in perhaps its most fundamental objective - to safeguard the use of the [[Irish language]] as the main community language in the Gaeltacht.

There is widespread belief in '''ghosts in Tibetan culture'''. [[Ghosts]] are explicitly recognized in the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] religion as they were in Indian [[Buddhism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Conze |first=Edward |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=A Short History of Buddhism  |origdate= |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition=2 |series= |volume= |year=1993 |publisher=Oneworld  |location=Oxford |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; occupying a distinct but overlapping world to the human one, and feature in many traditional legends.
When a human dies, after a period of uncertainty they may enter the ghost world.
A [[hungry ghost]] ([[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]]: ''yidag'', ''yi-dvags''; [[Sanskrit]]: ''preta'', प्रेत) has a tiny throat and huge stomach, and so can never be satisfied.
Ghosts may be killed with a ritual dagger or caught in a spirit trap and burnt, thus releasing them to be reborn.
Ghosts may also be exorcised, and an annual festival is held throughout Tibet for this purpose.
Some say that [[Dorje Shugden]], the ghost of a powerful 17th-century monk, is a deity, but the [[Dalai Lama]] asserts that he is a wrathful spirit, which has caused a split in the Tibetan exile community.

==Nature of ghosts==
Tibetan Buddhists believe that when a person dies, they enter the intermediate ''[[Bardo]]'' state, from which they may be reborn in this world in a human or animal body, in the ghost world in a ghost body, in one of the paradise realms or in one of the hells. But eventually, the person will die in this after-death world and be reborn as a human or other creature unless they achieve ''[[Nirvana]]'', where they are beyond all states of embodiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Hungry ghosts have their own realm depicted on the [[Bhavacakra]] and are represented as teardrop or paisley-shaped with bloated stomachs and necks too thin to pass food, so that attempting to eat is also incredibly painful. Some are described as having "mouths the size of a needle's eye and a stomach the size of a mountain". This is a metaphor for people futilely attempting to fulfill their illusory physical desires.
Sometime individuals have a predominance of hungry ghost in their makeup. They can never get enough, and are always hungry for more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Tibetan word for the emotional state of the hungry ghost, ''ser na'', literally means "yellow nosed", and could be said to mean "meanness" or "lack of generosity". The person in this state is constantly seeking to consume and to enrich themselves, but can never be satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A [[tulpa]] is a type of ghost or being that is created through mental effort, purely from the thoughts of its creator. A very skilled Buddhist practitioner or sorcerer may have this ability, and in some cases a Tulpa may be created from the collective thoughts of the villagers. Such a ghost is not self-aware at first, but may gradually acquire awareness and go on to become a normal human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Dealing with ghosts==

===Phurba===
The ''[[Kīla (Buddhism)|phurba]]'' ([[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]]: ཕུར་བ, [[Sanskrit]]: ''kīla'') is a ritual dagger used by a [[Vajrayana|tantric]] practitioner to release an evil spirit from its suffering and guide it to a better rebirth. Such a spirit (ghost) is a being which lingers in confusion between different realms. By plunging the dagger into it, it is thrown out of its confusion and gets the chance to be reborn, probably as a lower kind than human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Exorcising-Ghost day===
The Tibetan religious ceremony 'Gutor' ༼དགུ་གཏོར་༽, literally offering of the 29th, is held on the 29th of the 12th Tibetan month, with its focus on driving out all negativity, including evil spirits and misfortunes of the past year, and starting the new year in a peaceful and auspicious way.

The temples and monasteries throughout Tibet hold grand religious dance ceremonies, with the largest at [[Potala Palace]] in [[Lhasa]]. 
Families clean their houses on this day, decorate the rooms and eat a special noodle soup called '[[Guthuk]]'. ༼དགུ་ཐུག་༽
In the evening, the people carry torches, calling out the words of exorcism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==A folk tale==
A story tells of a man who met a ghost while out walking. The ghost started walking with him, which made him very frightened, although he hid his fear and pretended that he too was a ghost. They came to a town. The ghost left the man resting, entered the town and stole the soul of the king's son, tying it up in a yak hair sack. Returning to the man, the ghost left the sack in his care for a while. The man took the sack into the town, where the king was in great alarm because his son was dying. The man promised to revive the boy, conducting rituals and at the same time releasing the boy's soul from the bag. When the boy revived, the king gave the man half of all his property as reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Dorje Shugden==

{{main|Dorje Shugden}}
[[Dorje Shugden]] is the ghost of a powerful 17th-century monk who was murdered in his palace in Tibet. His adherents consider that he is a deity.  However, in the late 1970s the [[Dalai Lama]] reconsidered his faith in Dorje Shugden, and decided that the wrathful spirit was working against him, hampering his goal of seeking autonomy for Tibet with minimal interference from Beijing. This has caused a [[Dorje Shugden controversy|split]] between Tibetan exiles, with often bitter arguments between those who follow the Dalai Lama and those who continue to revere Dorje Shugden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Taetae ni Kiribati''' or '''Gilbertese''', also '''Kiribati''' (sometimes ''Kiribatese''), is a [[Micronesian language]] of the [[Austronesian language]] family. It has a basic [[verb–object–subject]] word order.

==Name==

The word ''Kiribati'' is the modern rendition for "Gilberts", so the name is not usually translated into English. "Gilberts" comes from Captain [[Thomas Gilbert (captain)|Thomas Gilbert]], who, along with Captain [[John Marshall (British captain)|John Marshall]], was one of the first Europeans to visit the [[Gilbert Islands]] in 1788. Some of the islands had been sighted or visited earlier,&lt;ref&gt;Maude, H. E. (1961). Post-Spanish discoveries in the central Pacific. Journal of the Polynesian Society, 67-111.&lt;/ref&gt; including by [[John Byron|Commodore John Byron]], whose ships happened on Nikunau in 1765. Frequenting of the islands by Europeans and Chinese dates from whaling and oil trading from the 1820s, when no doubt Europeans learnt to speak it, as I-Kiribati learnt to speak English and other languages foreign to them. However, it wasn't until [[Hiram Bingham II]] took up missionary work on [[Abaiang]] in the 1860s that the language began to take on the written form known today. For example, Bingham was the first to translate the Bible into Gilbertese, and wrote several hymn books, dictionaries and commentaries in the language of the Gilbert Islands.

The official name of the language is now ''te taetae ni Kiribati'', or 'the Kiribati language'.

The first complete description of this language was in ''Dictionnaire gilbertin–français'' of Father Ernest Sabatier (981 pp, 1954), a Catholic priest. This dictionary was later translated into English by Sister Olivia (with the help of [[South Pacific Commission]]).

==Speakers==
Over 99% of the 103,000 people living in [[Kiribati]] are ethnically I-Kiribati (wholly or partly)&lt;ref name=census&gt;{{cite web |title=Kiribati Census Report 2010 Volume 1 |url=http://www.mfed.gov.ki/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Census-Report-2010-Volume-1.pdf |publisher=National Statistics Office, Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, Government of Kiribati |accessdate=17 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RiBPOvsM?url=http://www.mfed.gov.ki/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Census-Report-2010-Volume-1.pdf |archivedate=10 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and speak Kiribati. Kiribati is also spoken by most inhabitants of [[Nui (atoll)|Nui]] ([[Tuvalu]]), [[Rabi Island]] ([[Fiji]]), [[Mili Atoll|Mili]] ([[Marshall Islands]]) and some other islands where [[demographics of Kiribati|I-Kiribati]] have been relocated ([[Solomon Islands]], notably [[Choiseul Province]]; and [[Vanuatu]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kiribati - Phoenix and Solomon Islands Resettlement Schemes|url=http://www.janeresture.com/kiribati_phoenix/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or emigrated (to [[New Zealand]] and [[Hawaii]] mainly).

Unlike some other languages in the [[Pacific]] region, the Kiribati language is far from extinct, and most speakers use it daily. 97% of those living in Kiribati are able to read in Kiribati, and 80% are able to read [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name="census"/&gt;

=== Countries by number of Kiribati speakers ===

==Linguistics and study==
The Kiribati language has two main [[dialect]]s: the Northern and the Southern dialects. The main differences between them are in the [[pronunciation]] of some words. The islands of [[Butaritari]] and [[Makin Island, Makin|Makin]] also have their own dialect. It differs from the standard Kiribati in vocabulary and pronunciation.

==Written Kiribati==
The Kiribati language is written in the [[Latin script]] and  since the 1840s, when [[Hiram Bingham II|Hiram Bingham]] Jr, a [[missionary]], first translated the [[Bible]] into Kiribati. Previously, the language was unwritten. Long vowels and consonants are represented by doubling the character, and a few digraphs are used for the velar nasals (/ŋ ŋː/) and velarized stops (i.e. /pˠ mˠ/).

===Translating Kiribati===

One difficulty in translating the Bible was references to words such as "[[mountain]]", a geographical phenomenon unknown to the people of the islands of Kiribati at the time (heard only in the myths from [[Samoa]]). Bingham decided to use "[[hill]]y", which would be more easily understood. Such adjustments are common to all languages as "modern" things require the creation of new words. For example, the Gilbertese word for airplane is ''te wanikiba'', "the canoe that flies".

[[Catholicism|Catholic]] missionaries arrived at the islands in 1888 and translated the Bible independently of Bingham, resulting in differences (Bingham wrote [[Jesus]] as "Iesu", while the Catholics wrote "Ietu") that would be resolved only in the 20th century. In 1954, Father [[Ernest Sabatier]] published the bigger and more accurate Kiribati to French dictionary (translated into English by Sister Olivia): ''Dictionnaire gilbertin–français'', 981 pages (edited by South Pacific Commission in 1971). It remains the only work of importance between the Kiribati and a Western language. It was then reversed by Frédéric Giraldi in 1995, creating the first French to Kiribati dictionary. In addition, a grammar section was added by Father Gratien Bermond (MSC). This dictionary is available at the [[French National Library]] (rare language department) and at the headquarters of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (MSC), [[Issoudun]].

(Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. As people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.

They said to each other, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”

But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”

So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city. That is why it was called Babel—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth. [[Book of Genesis]] 11:1–9)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+11:1-9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Stephens Salt''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɔː|l|t|,_|s|ɒ|l|t}}; 20 September 1851 – 19 April 1939) was an English writer and campaigner for social reform in the fields of prisons, schools, economic institutions, and the treatment of animals. He was a noted ethical [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]], anti-[[vivisection]]ist, [[socialist]], and [[pacifist]], and was well known as a literary critic, biographer, classical scholar and [[natural history|naturalist]]. It was Salt who first introduced [[Mohandas Gandhi]] to the influential works of [[Henry David Thoreau]], and influenced Gandhi's study of vegetarianism.&lt;ref&gt;"My faith in vegetarianism grew on me from day to day. Salt's book ''Plea for Vegetarianism'' whetted my appetite for dietetic studies. I went in for all books available on vegetarianism and read them". Mohandas Gandhi, ''[[An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth]]'', Part I, chapter XV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ashe, Geoffrey. Gandhi, a Biography. New York: Cooper Square Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Salt is credited with being the first writer to argue explicitly in favour of [[animal rights]], in his ''[[Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress]]'' (1894), rather than focusing on improvements to [[animal welfare]]. He wrote: "If we are ever going to do justice to the lower races, we must get rid of the antiquated notion of a 'great gulf' fixed between them and mankind, and must recognize the common bond of humanity that unites all living beings in one universal brotherhood."&lt;ref name=Salt1/&gt;

==Early life and career==
The son of a British army colonel, Salt was born in [[Naini Tal]] in India in 1851, but returned with his family to England in 1852 while still an infant. He studied at [[Eton College]], and graduated from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1875.&lt;ref name=bit&gt;H. F. Oxbury, ‘Salt, Henry Shakespear Stephens (1851–1939)’, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37932, accessed 15 Aug 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Cambridge, Salt returned to Eton as an assistant schoolmaster to teach classics. Four years later, in 1879, he married the scholar Catherine (Kate)Leigh Joynes, the daughter of a fellow master at Eton.&lt;ref name=bit/&gt; He remained at Eton until 1884, when, inspired by classic ideals and disgusted by his fellow masters' meat-eating habits and reliance on servants, he and Kate moved to a small cottage at Tilford, Surrey where they grew their own vegetables and lived very simply, sustained by a small pension Salt had built up. Salt engrossed himself in writing and began work on the pioneering Humanitarian League.

==Activism==

===Writing and influence===
During his lifetime Salt wrote almost 40 books.&lt;ref name="henrysalt.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.henrysalt.co.uk/biography.htm ''Henry S. Salt - Biography by Simon Wild''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305211751/http://www.henrysalt.co.uk/biography.htm |date=5 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first, ''A Plea for Vegetarianism'' (1886) was published by the [[Vegetarian Society]], and in 1890, he produced an acclaimed biography of philosopher [[Henry David Thoreau]], two interests that later led to a friendship with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. He also wrote, in ''On Cambrian and Cumbrian Hills'' (1922), about the need for [[nature conservation]] to protect the natural beauty of the British countryside from commercial vandalism.

His circle of friends included many notable figures from late-19th and early-20th century literary and political life, including writers [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Havelock Ellis]], Count [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[William Morris]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Ouida]], George Bernard Shaw and [[Robert Cunninghame-Graham]], as well as Labour leader James [[Keir Hardie]] and [[Fabian Society]] co-founders [[Hubert Bland]] and [[Annie Besant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Winsten|Winsten, Stephen]], ''Salt and His Circle'', 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarian League===
Salt formed the [[Humanitarian League]] in 1891. Its objectives included the banning of hunting as a sport (in this respect it can be regarded as a fore-runner of the [[League Against Cruel Sports]]).  In 1914 The League published a whole volume of essays on ''Killing for Sport'', the preface was written by [[George Bernard Shaw]].  The book formed in summary form the Humanitarian League's arraignment of blood-sports.&lt;ref name="henrysalt.co.uk"/&gt;

===Animal rights===
Keith Tester writes that, in 1894, Salt created an "[[Epistemology|epistemological]] break," by being the first writer to consider the issue of animal rights explicitly, as opposed to better animal welfare.&lt;ref name=TaylorTester&gt;Tester, Keith (1991) cited in Taylor, Angus. ''Animals and Ethics''. Broadview Press, 2003, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress]]'', Salt wrote that he wanted to "set the principle of animals' rights on a consistent and intelligible footing, [and] to show that this principle underlies the various efforts of humanitarian reformers ...":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even the leading advocates of animal rights seem to have shrunk from basing their claim on the only argument which can ultimately be held to be a really sufficient one&amp;mdash;the assertion that animals, as well as men, though, of course, to a far less extent than men, are possessed of a distinctive individuality, and, therefore, are in justice entitled to live their lives with a due measure of that 'restricted freedom' to which Herbert Spencer alludes.&lt;ref name=Salt1&gt;Salt, Henry S. ''[http://www.animal-rights-library.com/texts-c/salt01.htm Animals' Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress]'', Macmillan &amp; Co., 1894, chapter 1. He cited Spencer's definition of rights: "Every man is free to do that which he wills, provided he infringes not the equal liberty of any other man ... Whoever admits that each man must have a certain restricted freedom, asserts that it is right he should have this restricted freedom.... And hence the several particular freedoms deducible may fitly be called, as they commonly are called, his rights."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He wrote that there is no point in claiming rights for animals if we subordinate their rights to human interests, and he argued against the presumption that a human life necessarily has more value than a nonhuman one:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The] notion of the life of an animal having 'no moral purpose,' belongs to a class of ideas which cannot possibly be accepted by the advanced humanitarian thought of the present day&amp;mdash;it is a purely arbitrary assumption, at variance with our best instincts, at variance with our best science, and absolutely fatal (if the subject be clearly thought out) to any full realization of animals' rights. If we are ever going to do justice to the lower races, we must get rid of the antiquated notion of a 'great gulf' fixed between them and mankind, and must recognize the common bond of humanity that unites all living beings in one universal brotherhood."&lt;ref name=Salt1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37391">[[File:Antymasturbation machine.JPG|thumb|Antimasturbation machine in [[Prague]], ([[Sex Machines Museum]]).]]
The '''history of masturbation''' describes broad changes in society concerning the ethics, social attitudes, scientific study, and artistic depiction of [[masturbation]] over the history of human sexuality.

The [[Human sexuality|sexual]] stimulation of one's own [[sex organ|genitals]] has been 
[[Religious views on masturbation|interpreted variously by different religions]], and has been the subject of legislation, social controversy, activism, as well as intellectual study in [[sexology]].
Social views regarding masturbation taboo have varied greatly in different cultures, and over history.

==Ancient history==
There are depictions of male and female masturbation in prehistoric [[rock painting]]s around the world. Most early people seem to have connected human sexuality with abundance in nature. A clay figurine of the 4th millennium BC from a temple site on the island of [[Malta]], depicts a woman masturbating.&lt;ref&gt;"The [[Ħaġar Qim]] woman is... masturbating, with one hand languidly supporting her head. {{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Timothy |title=Uncovering the prehistory of sex |work= British Archaeology, no 15 |date= June 1996 |url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba15/ba15feat.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the ancient world depictions of male masturbation are far more common.

From the earliest records, the ancient [[Sumer]]ians had very relaxed attitudes toward sex.&lt;ref name="Dening1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dening|first=Sarah|date=1996|chapter=Chapter 3: Sex in Ancient Civilizations|title=The Mythology of Sex|url=http://www.ishtartemple.org/myth.htm|location=London, England|publisher=Macmillian|isbn=978-0-02-861207-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sumerians widely believed that masturbation enhanced sexual potency, both for men and for women,&lt;ref name="Dening1996"/&gt; and they frequently engaged in it, both alone and [[Mutual masturbation|with their partners]].&lt;ref name="Dening1996"/&gt; Men would often use ''puru''-oil, a special oil probably mixed with pulverized [[iron ore]] intended to enhance friction.&lt;ref name="Dening1996"/&gt; Masturbation was also an act of creation and, in [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian mythology]], the god [[Enki]] was believed to have created the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers by masturbating and ejaculating into their empty [[Stream bed|riverbeds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Leick|first=Gwendolyn|title=Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-134-92074-7|location=New York City, New York|page=32|quote=|via=|origyear=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKoWblE4pd0C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male masturbation was an even more important image in [[ancient Egypt]]: when performed by a god it could be considered a creative or magical act: the god [[Atum]] was believed to have created the universe by masturbating to ejaculation.

According to the ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' by the third-century AD biographer [[Diogenes Laërtius]], [[Diogenes of Sinope]], the fourth-century BC [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosopher, often masturbated in public, which was considered scandalous.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Examined Lives from Socrates to Nietzsche by James Miller pg:80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Robert H.|date=2006|title=The Classical Origins of Modern Homophobia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_q2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=Diogenes+of+SInope+masturbation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjNiYbQ0IneAhUc0IMKHZzoAvQQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Diogenes%20of%20SInope%20masturbation&amp;f=false|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|publisher=MacFarland &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-7864-2349-1|page=152|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alison2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Calhoun|first=Alison|date=2015|title=Montaigne and the Lives of the Philosophers: Life Writing and Transversality in the ''Essais''|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o0LxBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=Diogenes+of+SInope+masturbation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiojO6AzoneAhVMzIMKHW-3BaQQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Diogenes%20of%20SInope%20masturbation&amp;f=false|location=Newark, Delaware|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=978-1-61149-480-8|page=60|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people confronted him over this, he would say, "If only it were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my belly."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alison2015"/&gt; Diogenes, speaking in jest, credited the god [[Hermes]] with its invention: he allegedly took pity on his son [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], who was pining for [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]] but unable to seduce her, and taught him the trick of masturbation in order to relieve his suffering. Pan in his turn taught the habit to young shepherds.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Crysostom, ''Discourses,'' iv.20&lt;/ref&gt;

Masturbation is little noted in the sources for [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|ancient Roman sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, "Sexuality in the Roman Empire," in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire'' (Blackwell, 2006), p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Martial]] considers it an inferior form of sexual release resorted to by slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Though he admits to resorting to it: Martial, 2.43.14. See Craig A. Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 270; J.P. Sullivan, ''Martial, the Unexpected Classic: A Literary and Historical Study'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Though infrequently mentioned, masturbation was a longstanding theme in Latin satire, appearing in one of the few surviving fragments of [[Gaius Lucilius|Lucilius]], Rome's earliest practitioner of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;''At laeva lacrimas muttoni absterget amica'' ("A girlfriend wipes away Mutto's tears — his left hand, that is"): Lucilius 307 and 959. Kirk Freundenburg has dubbed the ''muttō'' of Lucilius "clearly the least finicky of all personified penises in Roman satire": ''Satires of Rome: Threatening Poses from Lucilius to Juvenal'' (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans preferred the left hand for masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Varone, ''Erotica pompeiana: Love Inscriptions on the Walls of Pompeii'' ("L'Erma" di Bretschneider, 2002), p. 95; ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 4.2066, as cited by John G.

==Cultures without masturbation==
Within the [[Congo Basin|African Congo Basin]], the [[Aka people|Aka]] and [[Ngandu people|Ngandu]] [[ethnic groups]] all lack a word for masturbation in their languages and are confused by the concept of masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SEX AND SEARCHING FOR CHILDREN AMONG AKA FORAGERS AND NGANDU FARMERS OF CENTRAL AFRICA |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726234118/http://jambo.africa.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kiroku/asm_normal/abstracts/pdf/31-3/107-125.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health concerns==
===Insanity===
Several medical papers were written on insanity as a result of masturbation, and was written as a reason for admission when a person was confined in a hospital. A doctor named J W Robertson tried to describe the differences between different types of masturbation in the year 1898, when addressing the Medical Society of the State of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM183503250120703 | volume=12 | title=Insanity, Produced by Masturbation | journal=The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal | pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cX8pdrsVT9YC&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=reasons%20for%20admission%201864%20to%201889&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q=reasons&amp;f=false "Parental Kidnapping in America: An Historical and Cultural Analysis" by Maureen Dabbagh.

===18th century pamphlet===
The first use of the word "onanism" to consistently and specifically refer to masturbation is a pamphlet first distributed in London in 1716 and attributed{{By whom|date=August 2013}} to Dutch theologian Dr. [[Balthazar Bekker]], titled "Onania, or the Heinous Sin of self-Pollution, And All Its Frightful Consequences, In Both Sexes, Considered: With Spiritual and Physical Advice To Those Who Have Already Injured Themselves By This Abominable Practice." It drew on familiar themes of sin and vice, this time in particular against the "heinous sin" of "self-pollution", with dire warnings that those who so indulged would suffer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Disturbances of the stomach and digestion, loss of appetite or ravenous hunger, vomiting, nausea, weakening of the organs of breathing, coughing, hoarseness, paralysis, weakening of the organ of generation to the point of impotence, lack of libido, back pain, disorders of the eye and ear, total diminution of bodily powers, paleness, thinness, pimples on the face, decline of intellectual powers, loss of memory, attacks of rage, madness, idiocy, epilepsy, fever and finally suicide.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Included were letters and testimonials supposedly from young men ill and dying from the effects of compulsive masturbation. The pamphlet then goes on to recommend as an effective remedy a "Strengthening Tincture" at 10 shillings a bottle and a "Prolific Powder" at 12 shillings a bag, available from a local shop.
"Onania" was a huge success with over 60 editions published and being translated into several languages.

===James===
In 1743–45, the British physician [[Robert James (physician)|Robert James]] published ''A Medicinal Dictionary'', in which he described masturbation as being "productive of the most deplorable and generally incurable disorders" and stated that "there is perhaps no sin productive of so many hideous consequences".&lt;ref&gt;Stengers, Jean; van Neck, Anne. ''Masturbation: the history of a great terror''. New York: Palgrave, 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-Wi_E6htSoAC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56 pp. 56–57]. {{ISBN|0-312-22443-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tissot===
[[File:L'onanismo frontispiece.jpg|thumb|1785 Italian edition of Samuel Auguste André David Tissot's book: ''Treatise on the Diseases Produced by Onanism''.]]
One of the many horrified by the descriptions of malady in ''Onania'' was the notable Swiss physician [[Samuel-Auguste Tissot]]. In 1760, he published '''L'Onanisme''', his own comprehensive medical treatise on the purported ill-effects of masturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stolberg|first1=Michael|title=An Unmanly Vice: Self-Pollution, Anxiety, and the Body in the Eighteenth Century|journal=Social History of Medicine|date=April 2000|volume=13|issue=1|page=3|doi=10.1093/shm/13.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing case studies of young male masturbators amongst his patients in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]] as basis for his reasoning, Tissot argued that semen was an "essential oil" and "stimulus", the loss of which in great amounts would cause "a perceptible reduction of strength, of memory and even of reason; blurred vision, all the nervous disorders, all types of [[gout]] and [[rheumatism]], weakening of the organs of generation, blood in the urine, disturbance of the appetite, headaches and a great number of other disorders."

In a 17th-century law code for the [[Puritan]] colony of [[New Haven, Connecticut]], [[blasphemy|blasphemers]], [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]] and masturbators were eligible for the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Though Tissot's ideas are now considered [[hypothesis|conjectural]] at best, his treatise was presented as a scholarly, scientific work in a time when experimental physiology was practically nonexistent. The authority with which the work was subsequently treated – Tissot's arguments were even acknowledged and echoed by luminaries such as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Voltaire]] – arguably turned the perception of masturbation in Western medicine over the next two centuries into that of a debilitating illness.

===Rush===
In 1812 [[Benjamin Rush]] included "Of the Morbid State of the Sexual Appetite" as chapter 18 of his book on diseases of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Rush]] (1812) [http://deila.dickinson.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/ownwords/id/20236 Medical Inquires and Observations upon the Diseases of the Mind], page 347, link from [[Dickinson College]]&lt;/ref&gt; In it he cites excessive eating, intemperance in drinking, and idleness as causative factors of onanism. Earlier in the book (page 33) he claims there is a "train of physical and moral evils which this solitary vice fixes upon the body and mind." In his charge of mentally ill people he notes three driven to mania by onanism (page 48). In his observation of "congenital idiotism" (page 292) he notes, "The venereal appetite exists in them with great force, and they gratify it after puberty by onanism."

By 1838 [[Jean Esquirol]] declared in his ''Des Maladies Mentales'' that masturbation was "recognized in all countries as a cause of insanity."&lt;ref&gt;E.H. Hare (1962) [http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/bjprcpsych/108/452/1.full.pdf Masturbatory Insanity: The History of an Idea], [[Journal of Mental Science]] 108:4 (issue #452)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Dufty]] (1975) [[Sugar Blues]], pages 65,6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White ===

In the 1870 book ''A Solemn Appeal Relative to Solitary Vice, and the Abuses and Excesses of the Marriage Relation'', edited by [[James Springer White]], husband of [[Ellen G. White]],  we find:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
If the practice [of self-indulgence] is continued from the age of fifteen and upward, nature will protest against the abuse he has suffered, and continues to suffer, and will make them pay the penalty for the transgression of his laws, especially from the ages of thirty to forty-five, by numerous pains in the system, and various diseases, such as affection of the [[liver]] and [[lungs]], [[neuralgia]], [[rheumatism]], affection of the [[Vertebral column|spine]], diseased [[kidneys]], and cancerous humors. Some of nature's fine machinery gives way, leaving a heavier task for the remaining to perform, which disorders nature's fine arrangement, and there is often a sudden breaking down of the constitution; and [[death]] is the result.&lt;ref name=White_1870&gt;{{cite book

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Females possess less vital force than the other sex, and are deprived very much of the bracing, invigorating air, by their in-door life. The result of self-abuse in them is seen in various diseases, such as [[catarrh]], [[dropsy]], headache, loss of memory and sight, great weakness in the back and loins, affections of the spine, and frequently, inward decay of the head. Cancerous humor, which would lie dormant in the system their lifetime, is inflamed, and commences its eating, destructive work. The mind is often utterly ruined, and insanity supervenes.&lt;ref name=White_1870/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Kellogg===
Doctor [[John Harvey Kellogg]] was an especially zealous campaigner against [[masturbation]]. Kellogg was able to draw upon many medical sources' claims such as "neither the plague, nor war, nor small-pox, nor similar diseases, have produced results so disastrous to humanity as the pernicious habit of [[onanism]]," credited to one [[Dr. Adam Clarke]]. Kellogg strongly warned against the habit in his own words, claiming of masturbation-related deaths "such a victim literally dies by his own hand," among other condemnations.  Kellogg believed the practice of "solitary-vice" caused cancer of the womb, urinary diseases, nocturnal emissions, impotence, epilepsy, insanity, and mental and physical debility – "dimness of vision" was only briefly mentioned.
In ''Plain Facts for Old and Young'', Kellogg issued a warning on the evils of sex. Of the 644 pages, 97 address "Secret Vice (Solitary Vice or Self-Abuse)", its symptoms and results. Included are 39 signs indicating someone is masturbating. 
He recommended, to cure children from this "solitary vice", bandaging or tying their hands, covering their genitals with patented cages, sewing the foreskin shut and electrical shock, and circumcision without anesthesia, which would break the habit. In order to prevent it, he advised parents first to teach children to avoid handling their genitalia, and as they get more mature, to inform them "of the evil consequences". He also warned parents against "evil associations", servants, and "wicked or ignorant" nurses who would masturbate children in order to quiet them.&lt;ref name=plainfacts&gt;{{cite book |title=Plain Facts for Old and Young |last=Kellogg |first=J.H. |authorlink= |year=1888 |chapter=Treatment for Self-Abuse and Its Effects |publisher=F.

===Freud===
[[Sigmund Freud]] wrote of the "disease of masturbation". "He was suffering from the effects of masturbation." &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XL6hDgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT841&amp;ots=ggUpB8B_Uv&amp;dq=Freud%20by%20a%20large%20stain%20on%20his%20trousers&amp;pg=PT841#v=onepage&amp;q=Freud%20by%20a%20large%20stain%20on%20his%20trousers&amp;f=false "Delphi Collected Works of Sigmund Freud" Sigmund Freud.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===bin Baz===
In the 1990s, [[Abd al-Aziz bin Baz]], the [[Grand Mufti]] of [[Saudi Arabia]], argued masturbation causes disruption of the digestive system, inflammation of the testicles, damage to the spine, "trembling and instability in some parts of the body like the feet", weakening of the "cerebral glands" leading to decreased intellect and even "mental disorders and insanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/17/worlddispatch.egypt/print|title=Seminal questions|accessdate=15 March 2010 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Brian | last=Whitaker | date=2006-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral concerns==
{{main|Religious views on masturbation}}

[[Immanuel Kant]] regarded masturbation as a violation of the moral law. In the ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]'' (1797) he made the ''[[a posteriori]]'' argument that 'such an unnatural use of one's sexual attributes' strikes 'everyone upon his thinking of it' as 'a violation of one's duty to himself', and suggested that it was regarded as immoral even to give it its proper name (unlike the case of the similarly undutiful act of [[suicide]]). He went on, however, to acknowledge that 'it is not so easy to produce a rational demonstration of the inadmissibility of that unnatural use', but ultimately concluded that its immorality lay in the fact that 'a man gives up his personality … when he uses himself merely as a means for the gratification of an animal drive'.

The 18th-century philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] saw masturbation as equal to 'mental rape', and discussed it in both [[Émile: or, on Education|Émile]] and [[Confessions of Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Confessions]]. He argued that it was the corrupting influence of society that led to such unnatural acts as masturbation and that humans living a simple life amidst nature would never do such things.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

This continued well into the [[Victorian Era]], where such medical censure of masturbation was in line with the widespread social [[conservatism]] and opposition to open sexual behavior common at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noharmm.org/paige.htm |title=The Ritual of Circumcision |publisher=Noharmm.org |date=2004-02-20 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stengers and van Neck. ''Masturbation''.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1879, [[Mark Twain]] wrote a speech titled ''[[Some Thoughts on the Science of Onanism]]'' which he ended with the words:
{{Quote box
 |class = &lt;!-- Advanced users only.  See the "Custom classes" section below. --&gt;
 |title = 
 |quote = Of all the various kinds of sexual intercourse, this has the least to recommend it. As an amusement it is too fleeting; as an occupation it is too wearing; as a public exhibition there is no money in it. It is unsuited to the drawing room, and in the most cultured society it has long since been banished from the social board…

So, in concluding, I say: If you must gamble away your life sexually, don’t play a Lone Hand too much.

When you feel a revolutionary uprising in your system, get your Vendome Column down some other way — don’t jerk it down.

There were recommendations to have boys' trousers constructed so that the genitals could not be touched through the pockets, for schoolchildren to be seated at special desks to prevent their crossing their legs in class and for girls to be forbidden from riding horses and bicycles because the sensations these activities produce were considered too similar to masturbation. Boys and young men who nevertheless continued to indulge in the practice were branded as "weak-minded."&lt;ref&gt;[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Sexpatent02.png Surgical Appliance]&lt;/ref&gt; Many "remedies" were devised, including eating a bland, meatless diet. This approach was promoted by [[John Harvey Kellogg|Dr. John Harvey Kellogg]] (inventor of [[corn flakes]]) and [[Sylvester Graham|Rev.

Routine neonatal [[circumcision]] was widely adopted in the United States and the UK at least partly because of its believed preventive effect against masturbation (see also [[History of male circumcision#Male circumcision to prevent masturbation|History of male circumcision]]). In later decades, the more drastic of these measures were increasingly replaced with psychological techniques, such as warnings that masturbation led to blindness, hairy hands or stunted growth. Some of these persist as myths even today. Referring to such viewpoints and treatments, Ollendick and Schroeder stated: "These are some of the darkest pages of religious and medical history."&lt;ref name="OllendickSchroeder2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas H.

==As taboo==
In 1905, [[Sigmund Freud]] addressed masturbation in his ''Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality'' and associated it with addictive substances. He described the masturbation of infants at the period when the infant is nursing, at four years of age, and at puberty.

At the same time, the supposed medical condition of [[female hysteria|hysteria]]&amp;mdash;from the Greek ''hystera'' or uterus&amp;mdash;was being treated by what would now be described as medically administered or medically prescribed masturbation for women.

In 1910, the meetings of the [[Vienna psychoanalytic circle]] discussed the moral or health effects of masturbation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/new_literary_history/v030/30.2bennett.html|title=Burghers, Burglars, and Masturbators: The Sovereign Spender in the Age of Consumerism|accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its publication was suppressed.

Medical attitudes toward masturbation began to change at the beginning of the 20th century when [[H. Havelock Ellis]], in his seminal 1897 work ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', questioned Tissot's premises, cheerfully named famous men of the era who masturbated and then set out to disprove (with the work of more recent physicians) each of the claimed diseases of which masturbation was purportedly the cause. "We reach the conclusion", he wrote, "that in the case of moderate masturbation in healthy, well-born individuals, no seriously pernicious results necessarily follow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Jean Stengers, Anne van Neck|title=Masturbation: the history of a great terror |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-Wi_E6htSoAC&amp;pg=PA133&amp;lpg=PA133|isbn=0-312-22443-5 | year=2001 | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Baden-Powell]], the founder of [[The Scout Association]], incorporated a passage in the 1914 edition of ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' warning against the dangers of masturbation. This passage stated that the individual should run away from the temptation by performing physical activity which was supposed to tire the individual so that masturbation could not be performed. By 1930, however, Dr. [[F. W. W. Griffin]], editor of ''The Scouter,'' had written in a book for Rover Scouts that the temptation to masturbate was "a quite natural stage of development" and, citing [[H. Havelock Ellis|Ellis]]' work, held that "the effort to achieve complete abstinence was a very serious error."

[[Concerning Specific Forms of Masturbation]] is a 1922 [[essay]] by [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[psychoanalyst]] [[Wilhelm Reich]]. 
In the seven and a half page essay Reich accepts the prevalent notions on the roles of [[unconscious fantasy]] and the subsequent emerging [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] feelings which he saw as originating from the act itself.

The works of sexologist [[Alfred Kinsey]] during the 1940s and 1950s, most notably the [[Kinsey Reports]], insisted that masturbation was an instinctive behaviour for both males and females, citing the results of Gallup Poll surveys indicating how common it was in the United States. Some critics of this theory held that his research was biased and that the Gallup Poll method was redundant for defining "natural behavior".

In the US masturbation has not been a diagnosable condition since [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] II (1968).&lt;ref name="Ley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J.

In the 1980s [[Michel Foucault]] was arguing masturbation taboo was "rape by the parents of the sexual activity of their children": 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To intervene in this personal, secret activity, which masturbation was, does not represent something neutral for the parents. It is not only a matter of power, or authority, or ethics; it's also a pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michel Foucault|title=Politics, philosophy, culture: interviews and other writings, 1977-1984 |page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HfWNHGCw55EC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=foucault+masturbation&amp;q=foucault%20masturbation|isbn=0-415-90149-9 | year=1990 | publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1994, when the [[Surgeon General of the United States]], Dr. [[Joycelyn Elders]], mentioned as an aside that it should be mentioned in school [[curriculum|curricula]] that masturbation was safe and healthy, she was forced to resign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Home " Resources " General Articles Question of the Week |url=http://www.jackinworld.com/library/articles/elders.html |title=JackinLibrary: Joycelyn Elders |publisher=Jackinworld.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with opponents asserting that she was promoting the teaching of ''how'' to masturbate.

[[Wank Week]] was a controversial season of television programming that was due to be broadcast in the United Kingdom by [[Channel 4]], expected to consist of a series of three documentary programmes about masturbation. However, plans to broadcast it were cancelled in March 2007.&lt;ref name=Welsh2006-02-02&gt;{{cite web|date=2006-02-02|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a42343/channel-4-abandons-wank-week.html|accessdate=2007-11-02| title= Channel 4 'abandons' "wank week"|last = Welsh|first = James|work=[[Digital Spy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3346">The '''Hiwi''' call themselves the “people of the savannah” for the vast flatlands they inhabit between the [[Meta River|Meta]] and [[Vichada River|Vichada]] rivers in [[Colombia]]. In [[Venezuela]], the Hiwi live in the states of [[Apure (state)|Apure]], [[Guarico (state)|Guarico]], [[Bolivar (state)|Bolivar]], and [[Amazonas (Venezuelan State)|Amazonas]]. Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century historians described the Hiwi as [[nomadic]] [[hunter-gatherers]]. Their long history of violent conflict, extending well into the twentieth century, has meant dramatic changes in their way of life.

Today, when the Hiwi visit [[Criollo people|criollo]] towns, they wear European-style clothing: shirts and pants for the men, and cotton dresses for the women. In their own villages, many continue to wear traditional loincloths made of cloth or of a vegetable bark called marima.

Traditional clothing also includes body ornaments. The Hiwi make necklaces of glass beads as well as shamanic amulet necklaces for ceremonial use, made with animal teeth, hooves, and beaks.

Textile crafts are an important part of their material culture. Using looms, the Hiwi weave high-quality [[hammocks]] with moriche or cumare fibers.

Historically, basketry has been a male occupation among the Hiwi, and the baskets they weave for transporting and storing foodstuffs are decorated with red and black geometric designs. Recently, women have begun to make baskets for commercial sale.

Some Hiwi still make pottery, although far fewer since the introduction of aluminum pots and plastic containers. Traditionally an activity of the dry season, vessels are made by rolling rings of clay over a base. After they dry, they are burned over an open fire and then decorated with vegetable dyes such as cumare and caruto. 

Despite a reputation as less than excellent navigators, the Hiwi do make [[curiaras]] and oars. The curiaras are made from a tree similar to the cedar. After the bark is removed, they use fire, hatchets, and [[machetes]] to shape the wood. From the same wood, they produce oars with round handles and oval paddles. Although made by hand, the completed curiara looks newly manufactured.

The Hiwi make wind and percussion musical instruments for festivities and ceremonial rituals, such as flutes with three holes made from large deer bones. Pan flutes, made with five or six tubes of caña amarga, often are played with another musical instrument made from the skull and antlers of the deer. 

The [[maraca]], the [[shaman]]’s principal musical instrument, is traditionally used for healing. The body of a [[maraca]] is made from a dried gourd, which is then painted with geometric patterns. It is often decorated as well with a tuft of [[curassow]] feathers.

'''Immigration to Pakistan''' refers to the settlement of foreign nationals in [[Pakistan]]. [[Immigration policy]] is overseen by the [[Interior Minister of Pakistan]] through the [[DGIP|Directorate General  Passports]]. Most immigrants are not eligible for [[Pakistani nationality law|citizenship or permanent residency]], unless they are married to a Pakistani citizen or a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] citizen who has invested a minimum of [[Pakistani rupee|PKR]] 5 million in the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgip.gov.pk/Files/Immigration.html|title=Immigration Policy|publisher=Directorate General of Immigration &amp; Passports|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Based on the [[United Nations]] report World Population Policies 2005, the total immigrant population in Pakistan was estimated to be 3,254,000, representing 2.1% of the national population, and ranked 13th in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=YgSsp6S1qnkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=kXSuhAamCt&amp;sig=nf3BbgP2FUT4tFxHgFC1ZrZO_8A&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result#PPP1,M1 "World Population Policies 2005"], United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, March 2006.  {{ISBN|978-92-1-151420-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/2006Migration_Chart/2006IttMig_chart.htm "International Migration 2006"], United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division.

As of 2009, 2.1% of the population of Pakistan had foreign origins. However, the number of immigrants population in Pakistan recently grew sharply.

Shaikh Muhammad Feroze, the chairman of the Pakistani Bengali Action Committee, claimed that there were 200 settlements of Bengali-speaking people in Pakistan, of which 132 are in Karachi. They are found in various areas of Pakistan such as Thatta, Badin, Hyderabad, Tando Adam and Lahore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/347968/fringe-pakistan-bengali-speaking-pakistanis-demand-right-to-vote/|title=Fringe Pakistan: Bengali-speaking Pakistanis demand right to vote|last=|first=|date=10 March 2012|work=Express Tribune|quote=Shaikh Muhammad Feroze, the chairman of the committee, said during a press conference on Friday that political parties and the government should acknowledge the sacrifices of their ancestors. 'We live in Sindh and feel proud to be called Sindhis rather than Bengalis. We appeal to Sindhi nationalists and Sindhis to help us in our struggle,' he added. He said that Bengali-speaking people were not given educational rights as they did not possess national identity cards. 'Our children can’t get an education after matriculation because colleges ask for the identity cards but the National Database Registration Authority has never accepted us as Pakistani citizens.' Shaikh said that over three million Bengalis and Biharis were grateful to the government for accepting them as Pakistani citizens. 'We postponed a hunger strike planned for March 25 after the government made decisions,' he added. 'We can go on a hunger strike, if our rights are not given.' He claimed that there were 200 settlements of Bengali-speaking people across the country, including 132 in Karachi. They populate different parts of Pakistan, including Thatta, Badin, Hyderabad, Tando Adam and Lahore.|access-date=26 December 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts say that the migration of both Bengalis and Burmese ([[Rohingya people|Rohingya]]) to Pakistan started in the 1980s and continued until 1998. Large scale Rohingya migration to Karachi made Karachi one of the largest population centres of Rohingyas in the world after Myanmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1165299|title=Identity issue haunts Karachi’s Rohingya population|last=Rehman|first=Zia Ur|date=23 Feb 2015|work=Dawn|quote=Their large-scale migration had made Karachi one of the largest Rohingya population centres outside Myanmar but afterwards the situation started turning against them.|access-date=26 December 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Burmese community of Karachi is spread out over 60 slums in Karachi such as the Burmi Colony in Korangi, Arakanabad, Machchar colony, Bilal colony, Ziaul Haq Colony and Godhra Camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/the-rohingyas-of-karachi/|title=The Rohingyas of Karachi|last=Khan|first=Naimat|date=12 June 2015|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all of these are asylum seekers waiting to immigrate to [[Australia]], [[North America]], and the [[European Union]]. They only stay in Pakistan as visitors because by international law they cannot apply for asylum in the countries that they escaped from.

==Illegal aliens==
In 2012, a Pakistani official claimed that five million illegal aliens live in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="trib five"/&gt; Since early 2002, Pakistan's government took steps to determine the number of illegal aliens in its country. The National Alien Registration Authority (NARA) started registering illegal aliens in January 2006.

According to some sources, thousands of radicals of [[Arab]] origin who entered the country illegally to fight in Afghanistan after the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion]] in 1979, and later against the [[Operation Enduring Freedom|US-led invasion]] in October 2001, still remain in the country.

Although the presence of illegal aliens in Pakistan is against the law, the [[Government of Pakistan]] did not make a serious effort to deport them until January 2010 when [[Interior Minister of Pakistan|Pakistani Interior Minister]] [[Rehman Malik]] asked illegal aliens to either leave or register themselves with the department concerned, as a major crackdown would soon be initiated against them.

'''Indigenous peoples in Ecuador''', also '''Native Ecuadorians''' or '''Native Americans''', are the groups of people who were present in what became [[Ecuador]] before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. The term also includes their descendants from the time of the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]] to the present. Their history, which encompasses the last 11,000 years,&lt;ref name="Salazar1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Salazar

==Migration==
The first inhabitants of the Americas migrated from Asia across the [[Beringia]] land bridge. The first inhabitants of South America arrived from North America via the [[Panamanian isthmus]].

==Archaeological periods==
While archaeologists have proposed different temporal models at different times, the schematic currently in use divides prehistoric Ecuador into five major [[List of archaeological periods (North America)|time periods]]: [[stone tool|Lithic]], [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]], [[Formative stage|Formative]], Regional Development, and Integration. These time periods are determined by the cultural development of groups being studied, and are not directly linked to specific dates, e.g. through [[carbon dating]].

The Lithic period encompasses the earliest stages of development, beginning with the culture that migrated into the American continents and continuing until the Late [[Pleistocene]] or Early [[Holocene]]. The people of this culture are known as Paleo-Indians, and the end of their era is marked by the extinction of the [[megafauna]] they hunted.

The Archaic period is defined as "the stage of migratory hunting and gathering cultures continuing into the environmental conditions approximating those of the present."&lt;ref name="Willey"&gt;{{cite book |last=Willey |first=Gordon R. |authorlink=Gordon Willey |author2=Philip Phillips |editor=R. Lee Lyman |others=Michael J. O'Brien |title=Method and theory in American archaeology |edition=second |series=Classics in Southeastern Archaeology |volume= |year=2001 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa |isbn=0-8173-1088-6 |pages=104–139 |origyear=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, hunters began to subsist on a wider variety of smaller game and increased their gathering activities.&lt;ref name="Marcos"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcos |first=Jorge G. |editor=J. Scott Raymond |others=Richard L.

The Formative Period is characterized by "the presence of agriculture, or any other subsistence economy of comparable effectiveness, and by the successful integration of such an economy into well-established, sedentary village life."&lt;ref name="Willey"/&gt; In Ecuador, this period is also marked by the establishment of trade networks&lt;ref name="Marcos"/&gt;{{rp|16}} and the spread of different styles of pottery.&lt;ref name="Marcos"/&gt;{{rp|19}} It began in about 3500 and ended around 2200 BP.

[[Regional Development]] is the period, dating roughly 2200&amp;ndash;1300 BP, of the civilizations of the Sierra, described as "localized but interacting states with complex ideologies, symbol systems, and social forms." The people of this period practiced metallurgy, weaving, and ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Peregrine  | first = Peter  | title = Outline of Archaeological Traditions  | publisher = Human Relations Area Files  | date = forthcoming  | location = New Haven  | pages =   | url = http://www.yale.edu/hraf/collections_body_archtraddetail.htm#SA  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Integration Period (1450 BP&amp;mdash;450 BP) "is characterized by great cultural uniformity, the development of urban centres, class-based social stratification, and intensive agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia  | title = Integration Period  | encyclopedia = The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology | volume =  | pages =   | publisher = Oxford University Press  | year = 2003  | id =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Integration Period ends and the historic era begins with the Inca conquest.

==Paleo-Indians==
The oldest artifacts discovered in Ecuador are stone implements discovered at 32 [[Cotton Pre-ceramic]] (Paleolithic) archaeological sites in the [[Santa Elena Peninsula]]. They indicate a [[Hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] economy, and date from the [[Late Pleistocene]] epoch, or about 11,000 years ago. These Paleo-Indians subsisted on the megafauna that inhabited the Americas at the time, which they hunted and processed with stone tools of their own manufacture.

Evidence of Paleoindian hunter-gatherer material culture in other parts of coastal Ecuador is isolated and scattered.&lt;ref name="Stothert"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Stothert  | first = Karen E.  | authorlink =   | author2 = Dolores R.

Despite the existence of these early coastal settlements, the majority of human settlement occurred in the Sierra ([[Andean]]) [[Regions of Ecuador|region]], which was quickly populated.&lt;ref name="Salazar2003"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Salazar  | first = Ernesto  | title = Los primeros habitantes del Ecuador I: Los primeros habitantes-1  | work = [[La Hora]]  | pages = | language = Spanish  | publisher =   | year = 2003 | url = http://www.dlh.lahora.com.ec/paginas/historia/historia1.htm  | accessdate = 2008-07-14  | quote= Los seres humanos parecen haber ocupado rápidamente el callejón interandino.

Due to agricultural disturbances of archaeological remains, it has been difficult to establish a consistent timeline for this site. The oldest artifacts there discovered, however, date to 9,750 BP.&lt;ref name="Salazar2003"/&gt;

In the South, archaeological discoveries include stone artifacts and animal remains found in the Cave of Chobshi, located in the ''[[Cantons of Ecuador|cantón]]'' of [[Sigsig]], which date between 10,010 and 7,535 BP. Chobshi also provides evidence of the domestication of the dog. Another site, Cubilán, rests on the border between Azuay and Loja provinces. Scrapers, projectile points, and awls discovered there date between 9,060 and 9,100 BP, while vegetable remains are up to a thousand years older.

In the Oriente, human settlements have  since at least 2450 BP.&lt;ref name="Rostoker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rostoker |first=Arthur |editor=J. Scott Raymond |others=Richard L. Burger|title=Archaeology of Formative Ecuador |format=PDF |year=2003 |publisher=Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-88402-292-7 |pages=541 |chapter=Formative Period Chronology for Eastern Ecuador |chapterurl=http://www.doaks.org/publications/doaks_online_publications/Ecuador/Ecuador14.pdf |quote=Preceramic and aceramic settlements, as well as later pottery-using societies, likely were already established at some places in the Oriente well before 500 B.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Settlements that probably date from this period have been found in the provinces of [[Napo Province, Ecuador|Napo]], [[Pastaza Province, Ecuador|Pastaza]], [[Sucumbíos Province, Ecuador|Sucumbíos]], and [[Orellana Province, Ecuador|Orellana]].&lt;ref name="Rostoker"/&gt; However, most of the evidence recovered in the Oriente suggest a date of settlement later than in the Sierra or the Coast.

==Origins of agriculture==
The end of the Ice Age brought changes to the flora and fauna, which led to the extinction of the large game hunted by Paleo-Indians, such as [[giant sloth]], [[mammoth]], and other [[Pleistocene megafauna]]. Humans adapted to the new conditions by relying more heavily on farming. The adoption of agriculture as the primary mode of subsistence was gradual, taking up most of the Archaic period. It was accompanied by cultural changes in burial practices, art, and tools.

The first evidence of [[agriculture]] dates anywhere from the Preboreal [[Holocene]] (10,000 years ago)&lt;ref name="Stothert"/&gt; to the Atlantic Holocene (6,000 years ago).&lt;ref name="Salazar1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marcos"/&gt;

Some of the first farmers in Ecuador were the [[Las Vegas culture (archaeology)|Las Vegas culture]] of the Santa Elena Peninsula/, who, in addition to making use of the abundant piscine resources, also contributed to the [[domestication]] of several beneficial plant species, including [[squash (plant)|squash]].&lt;ref name="Stothert"/&gt; They engaged in ritual burial and intensive gardening.

The [[Valdivia culture]], an outgrowth of the Las Vegas culture, was an important early civilization. While archaeological finds in Brazil and elsewhere have supplanted those at Valdivia as the earliest-known ceramics in the Americas, the culture retains its importance due to its formative role in Amerindian civilization in South America, which is analogous to the role of the [[Olmeca]] in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Salazar2003"/&gt; Most of the ceramic shards from the Early Valdivia date to about 4,450 BP (although some may be from up to 6,250 BP), with artifacts from the later period of the civilization dating from about 3,750 BP. Ceramics were utilitarian, but also produced pieces of very original art, like the small feminine figures referred to as "Venuses."

The Valdivia people farmed [[maize]], a large bean (now rare) of the [[Canavalia]] family, [[cotton]], and ''achira'' ([[Canna edulis]]). Indirect evidence suggests that [[yerba maté|maté]], [[coca]], and [[manioc]] were also cultivated. They also consumed substantial amounts of fish. Archaeological evidence from the Late Valdivia shows a decline in life expectancy to approximately 21 years. This decline is attributed to an increase in infectious disease, accumulation of waste, water pollution, and a deterioration in diet, all of which are associated with agriculture itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lippi | first = Ronald D. | title = La Primera Revolución Ecuatoriana: El desarrollo de la Vida Agrícola en el Antiguo Ecuador | publisher = Instituto de historia y antropología andinas | year = 1996 | location = Quito | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Sierra, people cultivated locally developed crops, including tree bean [[Erythrina edulis]], potatoes, [[quinoa]], and [[Lupinus mutabilis|tarwi]]. They also farmed crops that originated in the coastal regions and in the North, including ''ají'', [[peanut]]s, beans, and maize. [[Animal husbandry]] kept pace with agricultural development, with the domestication of the local animals [[llama]], [[alpaca]], and the [[guinea pig]], as well as the coastal [[Muscovy duck]]. The domestication of [[camelid]]s during this period laid the basis for the pastoral tradition that continues to this day.

In the Oriente, evidence of maize cultivation discovered at Lake Ayauchi dates from 6250 BP.&lt;ref name="Marcos"/&gt; In [[Morona-Santiago Province, Ecuador|Morona-Santiago province]], evidence of Regional Development period culture was discovered at the Upano Valley sites of Faldas de Sangay, also known as the Sangay Complex or Huapula, as well as at other nearby sites. These people created ceramics, farmed, and hunted and gathered.&lt;ref name="Rostoker"/&gt; They also built large earthen mounds, the smallest of which were used for agriculture or housing, and the largest of which had ceremonial functions. The hundreds of mounds spread over a twelve square kilometer&lt;ref name="Erickson"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Erickson | first = Clark  | authorlink = | title = Lomas de ocupación en los Llanos de Moxos | journal = Arqueología de las Tierras Bajas | volume =  | issue =  | pages = 207–226 | publisher = | location = Montevideo | year = 2000 | url =http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~cerickso/fishweir/articles/EricksonLomasMoxos2000.pdf |format=PDF| doi =  | id =  | accessdate = 2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; area at Sangay demonstrate that the Oriente was capable of supporting large populations.

The period from 2450 BP&amp;mdash;1450 BP is known as the "Regional Development" period, and is marked by the development of metalworking skills. The artisans of [[La Tolita]], an island in the estuary of the Santiago River, made alloys of platinum and gold, fashioning the material into miniatures and masks. The Jama-Coaque, Bahía, Guangala, and Jambalí also practiced metalwork in other areas of the Ecuadorian coast.&lt;ref name="Shimada"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shimada |first=Izumi|editor=Frank Salomon |others=Stuart B. Schwartz |title=South America |url= |edition=third |series=The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas |volume=III |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-63075-4 |chapter=Evolution of Andean Diversity: Regional Formations (500 B.C.E-C.E. 600)}}&lt;/ref&gt; These goods were traded though mercantile networks.

==Pre-Inca era==
Prior to the invasion of the Inca, the indigenous societies of Ecuador had complex and diverse social, cultural, and economic systems. The ethnic groups of the central Sierra were generally more advanced in organizing farming and commercial activities, and the peoples of the Coast and the Oriente generally followed their lead, coming to specialize in processing local materials into goods for trade.

===Coast===
The coastal peoples continued the traditions of their predecessors on the Santa Elena peninsula. They include the Machalilla, and later the Chorrera, who refined the ceramicism of the Valdivia culture.

===Oriente===
The economy of the peoples of the Oriente was essentially [[silvicultural]], although horticulture was practiced. They extracted dyes from the [[achiote]] plant for face paint, and [[curare]] poisons for blowgun darts from various other plants. Complex religious systems developed, many of which incorporated (or perhaps originated from) the use of hallucinogenic plants such as ''[[Datura]]'' and ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi|Banisteriopsis]]''. They also made coil ceramics.

===Sierra===
In the Sierra, the most important groups were the Pasto, the [[Caras (tribe)|Caras]], the Panzaleo, the Puruhá, the [[Cañari]], and the [[Palta]].&lt;ref name="Rudolph"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Rudolph  | first = James D.  | authorlink =   | title = A Country Study: Ecuador  | publisher = Library of Congress  | year = 1991  | location = Washington, D.C. | pages =   | url = http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ectoc.html  | doi =  | id = LCCN F3708.E383 1991 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They lived on hillsides, [[terrace farming]] maize, [[quinoa]], beans, [[potato]]es and squash, and developed systems of [[irrigation]]. Their political organization was a dual system: one of chieftains, the other, a land-holding system called ''curacazgo'', that regulated the planting and harvesting of multiple cycles of crops. While some historians have referred to this system as the "Kingdom of Quito", it did not approach the level of political organization of the [[State (polity)|state]].

====Economy====
Using the system of multicyclic agriculture, which allowed them to have year-long harvests of a wide variety of crops by planting at a variety of altitudes and at different times, the Sierra people flourished. Generally, an ethnic group farmed the mountainside nearest to it. Cities began to specialize in the production of goods, agricultural and otherwise. For this reason, the dry valleys, where cotton, coca, ''ají'' ([[chili pepper]]s), [[indigo]], and fruits could be grown and where salt could be produced, gained economic importance. Sometimes, tribes farmed lands outside their immediate purview. These goods were then traded in a two-tiered market system.

Free commerce took place in markets called "''tianguez''", and was the means by which ordinary individuals fulfilled their need for tubers, maize, and cotton. Directed commerce, however, was undertaken by specialists called ''mindala'' under the auspices of a ''curaca''. They also exchanged goods at the ''tianguez'', but specialized in products that had ceremonial purposes, such as coca, salt, gold, and beads. Seashells were sometimes used as currency in places such as [[Pimampiro]] in the far North. Salt was used in other parts of the Sierra, and in other places where salt was abundant, such as [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]].

In this manner, the Pasto and the Caras undertook their existence in the [[Chota Valley]], the Puruhá in the Chanchán riverbasin, and the Panzaleos in the Patate and Guayallabamba valleys.

In the coastal lowlands, the Esmeralda, the Manta, the Huancavilca, and the Puná were the four major groups. They were seafarers, but also practiced agriculture and trade, both with each other and with peoples of the Sierra.&lt;ref name="Rudolph"/&gt; The most important commodity they provided, however, were [[Spondylus]] shells, which was a symbol of fertility.&lt;ref name="Shimada"/&gt; In areas such as [[Guayas Province|Guayas]] and [[Manabí Province, Ecuador|Manabí]], small beads called ''chiquira'' were used as currency.

Also following the lead of the Sierra peoples, the people of the Oriente began congregating around sites where cotton, coca, salt, and beads could be more easily produced for trade. ''Tianguez'' developed in the Amazon forest, and were visited by ''mindala'' from the Sierra.

====Political organization====
The [[extended family]], in which [[polygyny]] was common, was the basic unit of society. The extended family group is referred to by the Kichwa word "''ayllu''", although this type of organization predates the arrival of Quechua speakers. Two political systems were built on the basis of the ''ayllu'': the ''curacazgo'' and the ''[[cacicazgo]]''. Each ''curacazgo'' is made up of one or more ''ayllu''. The Ecuadorian ''ayllus'', unlike in the Southern Andes, were small, made up of only about 200 people, although the larger ones could reach up to 1,200 members. Each ''ayllu'' had its own authority, although each ''curaca'' also answered to a chief (''[[cacique]]''), who exercised power over the ''curacazgo''. The ''cacique'''s power depended on his ability to mobilize manual labor, and was sustained by his ability to distribute highly-valued goods to the members of his ''curaca''.

====Religion====
Local beliefs and practices co-existed those practiced regionally, which allowed each ethnic group to maintain its own religious identity while interacting, especially commercially, with neighboring groups. Some regional commonalities were the [[solar calendar]], which marked the solstices and equinoxes, and veneration of the sun, moon, and maize.

==Inca conquest==
The [[Inca]] empire expanded into what later became Ecuador during the reign of [[Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui]], who began the northward conquest in 1463. He gave his son [[Topa Yupanqui|Topa]] control of the army, and Topa conquered the [[Quitu]] and continued coastward. Upon arriving, he undertook a sea voyage to either the [[Galápagos]] or the [[Marquesas Islands]]. Upon his return, he was unable to subdue the people of [[Puná Island]] and the [[Guayas Province|Guayas]] coast. His son [[Huayna Capac]], however, was able to subsequently conquer these peoples, consolidating Ecuador into "Tawantinsuyu", the [[Inca Empire]].&lt;ref name="Rudolph"/&gt;

Many tribes resisted the imperial encroachment, in particular the [[Cañari]] in the south, near modern-day [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]],&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Espinoza E., [http://revistas.arqueo-ecuatoriana.ec/es/apachita/apachita-16/176-tomebamba-pumapungo-hatun-canar ''Tomebamba, Pumapungo, Hatun Cañar''] Arqueología Ecuatoriana 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the Caras and the [[Quitu]] in the North. However, the Inca language and social structures came to predominate, particularly in the Sierra. To reduce the opposition to their rule, one of the Inca's tactics included uprooting groups of Quechua-speakers loyal to the empire and resettling them in areas that offered resistance, a system called [[mitma]]. The [[Saraguro people|Saraguros]] in [[Loja province]] may have their origin from mitmas relocated from other parts of the Inca Empire.

Some scholars dispute the Inca heritage of indigenous people of Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;http://revistas.arqueo-ecuatoriana.ec/es/apachita/apachita-17/184-si-quieren-ser-inkas-que-sean-felices&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish conquest==
In 1534, at the time of the arrival of the first columns of Spanish conquistadores, the population of the present day territories of Ecuador is believed to border the figure of one million inhabitants. This might have been a result of epidemics of smallpox and diphtheria that spread in the Andes after the first contacts with Spanish explorers and their livestock. According to early Spanish chronicles the Inca Huayna Capac died of smallpox and then the territories of Collasuyo and central Peru so a period of civil war for the control of the royal household between two brothers each an heir to the dominions of their respective maternal feudal lands.

Huáscar was a prince born to a noble family of Cuzco and Atahualpa was a son from a noble family of the Quitus. The quitus were a tribe that formed an alliance with the Incas during the conquest of Huayna Capac. Most important in this civil war was the participation of Huayna Capac generals on the side of Athaulpa's faction, probably due to the late sovereign wish.

==Rubber boom==
The 19th century marked a time in history when the need for rubber came into high demand in the world.&lt;ref name="fch.ju.edu"&gt;Ingrid Fernandez, [http://fch.ju.edu/FCH-2007/Fernandez-The%20Upper%20Amazonian%20Rubber%20Boom%20and%20Indigenous%20Rights%201900.htm ''The Upper Amazonian Rubber Boom and Indigenous Rights 1900-1925''] Florida Gulf Coast University&lt;/ref&gt; Many Western Territories including America wanted to produce Rubber Industries in desire to produce economic prosperity. They also expressed an alternative goal, which was to also make better the region they will be in partnership with by improving their land and their economic status as well.&lt;ref name="fch.ju.edu"/&gt;
Reasons as to why they decided to obtain partnership with the Amazonian region was for multiple reasons. One of the reasons was that the location was ideal. Two of the most high quality rubber trees grew in that region; the Hevea tree and the Castilloa.  tree&lt;ref name="collectionscanada.gc.ca"&gt;http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk3/SSU/TC-SSU-05202006230338.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Hevea tree was only able to be used 6 month out of the year while the Castilloa was able to be used the whole year.&lt;ref name="collectionscanada.gc.ca"/&gt; To begin the trading system, the Western territories began to obtain discourse with the Mestizos of the land which were known to be the more prestigious of the different groups residing in Ecuador. They became highly tied into the trading system that was created. There was fast money involved in this system that attracted the Mestizos. Economic prosperity seemed promising. As the rubber industry flourished many other factors came to surface in the system of Rubber production. Because of the high demand for rubber at the time, the Mestizos who became known as the Caucheros (rubber barons) decided that they needed to obtain an abundant amount of workers that would work for low wages.&lt;ref name="fch.ju.edu"/&gt; The indigenous population soon came to mind because of a couple of factors. One was due to the fact that they seemed the best fit to perform the labor. They knew the lands on which they would work because of their long history of living on the land. They were well adapted to the climate and familiar with means of survival like hunting and gathering.&lt;ref name="fch.ju.edu"/&gt; The enslavement of the Indigenous people soon became an epidemic. Natives were taken from their homes by a group called the Muchachos who were African men hired by the Caucheros to do their dirty work.{{r|fch.ju.edu}} They were in turn forced to work in the rubber industries by fear and intimidation and were put on a rubber quota with time constraints and were expected to meet the demands.

If the quotas were not met they were punished. Punishments by the Muchachos were very severe and brutal. Common punishments including flogging, hanging, and being put into a cepo.&lt;ref name="fch.ju.edu"/&gt; When the workers were put into a cepo they were chained in pain inflicting positions and left without food and water for an extended amount of time.&lt;ref name="fch.ju.edu"/&gt; More extreme punishments included the shooting workers if they tried to escape or became too ill to work.&lt;ref name="fch.ju.edu"/&gt; The pay for their hard labor was minimal. They were put on what was called a debt-penoage where they had to work for a long period of time in order to gain funds to pay back debt they owned to the Caucheros for supplies that they were given for their daily tasks such as tools to work, clothes, and food.&lt;ref name="fch.ju.edu"/&gt; The low compensation for their labor often led to working their whole life for the rubber barons. They usually received a small item that they were able to keep, like a hammock, and the rest was given straight to the employer.&lt;ref name="fch.ju.edu"/&gt; There was very little Government intervention thanks to bribery that got local officials to overlook what was occurring and the fear of being attacked by the Indians.&lt;ref name="fch.ju.edu"/&gt; The end of the Rubber Boom was in 1920 when the prices of rubber dropped. The enslavement of the Indigenous people ceased with the end of the rubber boom.

==Modern times==

===Population and demographics===
There is debate about the quantities of indigenous currently inhabiting Ecuador. Some elements of society, most famously the former President [[León Febres Cordero]], have insisted that the indigenous make up no more than two million people. Historian Enrique Ayala Mora, too, estimates that the indigenous population is no more than sixteen percent.&lt;ref name="Gerlach"&gt;Gerlach, Allen. Indians, Oil and Politics: A Recent History of Ecuador. SR Books, Wilmington Delaware. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} Other organizations, such as CONAIE, while giving varying estimates in different years, tend to approximate closer to four million. The discrepancy arises from the ways in which they are counted: "[d]oes one consider them such on the basis of physical characteristics or whether they live in the Andean Indian world?"&lt;ref&gt;''El Comercio'', cited in Gerlach, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 96.4% of Ecuador's Indigenous population are Highland [[Quichua]]s living in the valleys of the Sierra region.&lt;ref name="Gerlach" /&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} They are Quichua speakers and include the Caranqui, the [[Otavaleño]]s, the Cayambi, the Pichincha, the Panzaleo, the Chimbuelo, the Salasacan, the Tungurahua, the Tugua, the Waranka, the Puruhá, the Cañari, and the Saraguro. Linguistic evidence suggests that the Salascan and the Saraguro may be the descendents of Bolivian ethnic groups transplanted to Ecuador in a mitma, or forced migration.

Coastal groups, including the [[Awá (kwaiker)|Awá]], Chachi, and the [[Tsáchila]], make up 0.24% percent of the indigenous population, while the remaining 3.35 percent live in the Oriente and consist of the Oriente Quichua (the Canelo and the [[Quijos-Quichua|Quijos]]), the [[Shuar people|Shuar]], the [[Huaorani]], the [[Siona people|Siona]]&amp;ndash;[[Secoya people|Secoya]], the [[Cofán]], and the [[Achuar]].

===Politics===
In 1986, indigenous people formed the first "truly" national political organization.{{Dubious|date=May 2012}}&lt;ref name="Gerlach"/&gt;{{rp|xv}} The [[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] (CONAIE) has been the primary political organization ever since, and has been influential in national politics, including the ouster of the presidents [[Abdalá Bucaram]] in 1997 and [[Jamil Mahuad]] in 2000.

In 1998, Ecuador signed and ratified the current international law concerning indigenous peoples, [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20021119000740/http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/ratifce.pl?C169 NORMLEX] International Labour Organization (ILO)&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted in 1989 as the [[International Labour Organization]] Convention 169.

===Petroleum operations===
The year 1978 marked the beginning of petroleum production in Ecuador.&lt;ref name="texaco.com"&gt;[http://www.texaco.com/sitelets/ecuador/en/history/background.aspx Background on Texaco Petroleum Company's Former Operations in Ecuador] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816102726/http://www.texaco.com/sitelets/ecuador/en/history/background.aspx |date=August 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Texaco is documented to be the primary international oil company that was given permission to export oil from the coast of Ecuador. This company managed the oil operation from 1971 to 1992.&lt;ref name="ije.oxfordjournals.org"&gt;http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/5/1170.full&lt;/ref&gt; The Ecuadorian government along with Texaco began to scout the Oriente in a joint business known as a consortium.&lt;ref name="texaco.com"/&gt; Major shipments of oil were put into action in 1972 after the Trans-Ecuadorian Pipeline was finished. In the years of production business in oil production increased rapidly and Ecuador soon became the second largest producer of oil in South America.&lt;ref name="counterspill.org"&gt;Carly Gillis, [http://www.counterspill.org/article/ecuador-vs-chevron-texaco-brief-history Ecuador Vs. Chevron-Tesaco: A Brief History] April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Texaco's contract for oil production in Ecuador expired in 1992. PetroEcuador then took over 100% of the oil production management. 1.5 billion barrels of crude oil was reported to have been extracted while under the management of Texaco.&lt;ref name="ije.oxfordjournals.org"/&gt; There were also reports of 19 billion gallons of waste that had been dumped into the natural environment with the absence of any monitoring or overseeing to prevent damages to the surrounding areas.&lt;ref name="ije.oxfordjournals.org"/&gt; In addition there was a report of 16.8 million gallons of crude that was dispersed into the environment in relation to spillage out of the Trans-Ecuadorian pipeline.&lt;ref name="ije.oxfordjournals.org"/&gt;

In the early 1990s a lawsuit led by Ecuadorian government officials of 1.5 billion dollars was presented against the Texaco company with claims that there was an immense pollution epidemic that led to the demise of many natural environments as well as an increase in human illnesses.&lt;ref name="counterspill.org"/&gt; A cancer study was conducted in 1994 by the Centre for Economic and Social Rights which found a rise in health concerns in the Ecuadorian region.&lt;ref name="counterspill.org"/&gt;  it was found that there was a notably higher incidence of cancer in women and men in the countries where there was oil production present for over 20 years.&lt;ref name="ije.oxfordjournals.org"/&gt; Women also reported increased rates in a copious amount of physical ailments such as skin mycosis, sore throat, headaches and gastritis.&lt;ref name="ije.oxfordjournals.org"/&gt; The primary argument against these findings were that they were weak and biased. Texaco decided on jurisdiction in Ecuador. The case put against Texaco remained in the works for some time. In 2001, Texaco was taken over by Chevron, another oil company, which assumed the liabilities left by the previous production.&lt;ref name="counterspill.org"/&gt; On February, 2011 Chevron was found guilty after inheriting the case left by Texaco and was said to be required to pay 9 billion dollars in damages. This is known to be one of the largest environmental lawsuits award recorded.&lt;ref&gt;SIMON ROMERO and CLIFFORD KRAUSS, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/world/americas/15ecuador.html?_r=2&amp;ref=ecuador Ecuador Judge Orders Chevron to Pay $9 Billion] NYTimesFebruary 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Ethnic Wage Gap in Ecuador&lt;/big&gt;'''

Ecuador has a history of Spanish colonization of indigenous people that were enslaved, abused, and exploited. Eventually the country adapted the French Neo-Lamarck ideology leading to “mestizaje.” This “mestizaje” began in the sixteenth century where white colonizers began to mix with indigenous to “improve” the indigenous race. Ecuador’s historical background has left the country with a very stratified social environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Telles|first=Edward|date=May 2013|title=Understanding Latin American Beliefs about Racial Inequality|url=|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=118|pages=1559–1595|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the nucleus of the stratification of different social classes in Ecuador. There have been many attempts to reduce such stratification such as making indigenous languages official in 1998. The Republic of Ecuador also self claimed itself plurinational and intercultural in 2008.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roitman|first=Karem|date=December 2017|title=Mestizo Racism in Ecuador|url=|journal=Ethnic &amp; Racial Studies|volume=40|pages=2768–2786|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential to understand the causes of such racial inequality in a given society in order to be able to approach the problem. Understanding the root of the problems also allows us to understand the existence or lack of public policy initiatives.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Structuralist explanations for such inequality is supported by both the minority and dominant groups. Although 19.5% of Ecuadorians believe the economic inequality between the races is due to insufficient work effort from minorities, 47.0% believe it arises from discrimination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unfortunately, the widest gap of income inequality in the world is in Latin America.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The difference in economic division across ethnicities is a consequence of human capital and discrimination.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=García-Aracil|first=Adela|date=2006|title=Gender and Ethnicity Differentials in School Attainment and Labor Market Earnings in Ecuador|url=|journal=World Development|volume=34|pages=289–307|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be concluded through research that indigenous people in Ecuador are predisposed to live in poverty and be discriminated against.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The percent of indigenous population in Ecuador that lives in poverty differs by 4.5 times that of the non-indigenous population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Education is one of the greatest factors for such economical inequality in the country. The lack of education for many indigenous people makes it difficult for the ethnic group to overcome such poverty. Unfortunately, the probability of indigenous people to stay in school is very low. It is evident that there is an existing difference in education between the ethnic groups. The indigenous population only has an average of 4.5 years of formal education, while non-indigenous population’s average of years is 8.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The minority group has a net secondary school enrollment rate of 14.0% and because of rural residence and work they have a much lower probability of staying in school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There is also a drastic social impact on Indigenous people mainly through exclusion.  This racism raised the use of certain terminology such as “cholo” and “longo” which are threatening because they are not institutionalized to any official ethnic group. With such unhistorical and unstructured rise to the terminology, the terminology is more flexible when used and persistent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The paternalistic system of ethnic discrimination transitioned to a more democratization of racial relations. Although there are no more “hacienda’s” (working systems where Indians were exploited for labor) and Indians now have a right to vote, there is still an everyday discriminatory challenge. Indians often feel vulnerable and predisposed to physical and verbal attacks, which cause them to be more reserved and avoid contact with whites. An indigenous witness claimed he was told to leave a restaurant because “no Indians [were] admitted to [that] locale”.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de la Torre|first=Carlos|date=January 1999|title=Everyday Forms of Racism in Contemporary Ecuador: The Experiences of the Middle-Class Indians|url=|journal=Ethnic &amp; Racial Studies|volume=22|pages=92–112|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Racism can be seen such as travelling in public transportation, interactions in public spaces, and the yearning to be white from Indians.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''International Social Survey Programme''' ('''ISSP''') is a collaboration between different nations conducting surveys covering topics which are useful for social science research. The ISSP researchers develop questions which are meaningful and relevant to all countries which can be expressed in an equal manner in different languages. The results of the surveys provide a cross-national and cross-cultural perspective to individual national studies. Through 2015 58 countries have participated in the ISSP.&lt;ref&gt;ISSP official Statement "About Us" http://issp.org/about-issp/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The ISSP was founded in 1984&lt;ref&gt;ISSP Official Website http://issp.org/about-issp/history/&lt;/ref&gt; by research organizations from four countries:
* Zentrum für Umfragen, Methoden, und Analysen (ZUMA), [[Mannheim]], Germany. now [[GESIS – Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences]]
* [[National Opinion Research Center]] (NORC), [[University of Chicago]], [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States.
* Social and Community Planning Research (SCPR), [[London]], United Kingdom. now [http://natcen.ac.uk/ National Centre for Social Research, NatCen]
* Research School of Social Sciences (RSSS), [[Australian National University]], now [http://demography.anu.edu.au/ School of Demography] [[Canberra]], Australia.

Four different Social Surveys included a common module each year:
* The [[British Social Attitudes Survey]] (BSA) in the UK
* The [[General Social Survey]] (GSS) in the USA
* The [[ALLBUS]] or [[German General Social Survey]] (GGSS) in Germany and 
* The Surveys by the Research School of Social Sciences

Ever since social science institutions from 58 different countries included a 15 minute supplement to their national surveys. The membership to the ISSP is institutional and by country. One or more than one institute in a country can co-operate on ISSP research (cf. France and Spain). The common module surveyed by the member institutions also contains an extensive common core of background varibales. The modules focus on one specific topic each year and were planned to be repeated more or less every five to ten years. When it comes to the researchers choice of topics, the relevance of the area of social sciences in the year of the survey is taken into account.
Given this, the ISSP deliveres data sets helpful for both [[Cross-sectional studies]] and [[Time series analysis]].
Over time the set of modules has grown towards more diverse topics. The latest additions were Leisure and Sports in 2007 as well as Health and Health Care in 2011.

== Organisation ==
The ISSP is a self-funding organisation with an emphasis on democratic decision making stated in its working principles. To accomplish this principle it has set up several groups and committees. These groups either consist of member organizations as a whole or include some particualr social scientists. There are:
* The ISSP secretariat (2015-2018): GESIS-Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences, Germany
* The ISSP archive (collaboration between Spain and Germany)
* Methodology research groups
* The ISSP sub-groups drawn up within the ISSP
* Drafting groups for modules
* The ISSP Standing Committee
Most of the members of these groups are elected democratically at the '''General Assembly.''' These meetings of delegates from every member state of the ISSP are held in May or June in changing locations all around the world. The General Assemblies also serve the function of discussing modules, which are to be completed the same year or begun and surveyed the upcoming one. The delegates also discuss the topics of upcoming modules.

The ISSP also gives importance to the way member organisation implement their surveys. The organisation´s principles are published in its [http://issp.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Rules_and_regulations/ethical_statement_issp.pdf ethical statement] and its [http://issp.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Rules_and_regulations/ISSP_WP_FINAL_2018.pdf working principles].

== Methodology ==
The methodological work in the ISSP is coordinated by a '''Methodology Committee''', consisting of seven members elected at the '''General Meeting'''. It co-ordinates the work of six groups addressing different areas of '''cross-cultural methods''', all concerned with issues of equivalence: demography, non-response, weighting, mode effects, questionnaire design and translation.

'''John Chinaman''' was a stock [[caricature]] of a Chinese laborer seen in [[cartoon]]s of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecore.nus.edu.sg/victorian/periodicals/punch/35.html An example from ''Punch'', May 9, 1857 at www.thecore.nus.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925174716/http://www.thecore.nus.edu.sg/victorian/periodicals/punch/35.html |date=September 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also referenced by [[Mark Twain]] and popular [[United States|American]] songs of the period,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/history/baker/w3630/edit/chinpoem.html An example from ''The California Songster'', 1855, at www.columbia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;  John Chinaman represented, in western society, a typical persona of [[China]]. He was typically depicted with a long [[queue (hairstyle)|queue]] and wearing a [[conical Asian hat|coolie hat]].

American political cartoonist [[Thomas Nast]], who often depicted John Chinaman, created a variant, '''John Confucius''', to represent Chinese political figures. 
 
In Nast's cartoon "A Matter of Taste", published March 15, 1879 (''seen at right''), John Confucius expresses disapproval of [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[James G. Blaine]] for his support of the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]]. Blaine is shown dining in "Kearney's Senatorial Restaurant"—a reference to [[Denis Kearney]], the leader of a violent anti-Chinese movement in [[California]]. John Confucius asks, "How can Christians stomach such diet?"

According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', the term first emerged with British sailors who, uninterested in learning how to pronounce the names of the Chinese stewards, firemen, and sailors who worked as part of their crews, came up with the generic nickname of "John".&lt;ref&gt;"John, n.".

'''Ken Weaver''' (born February 10, 1966) is a former [[NASCAR]] driver from [[Dallas, Texas]]. He drives the 20 [[PhoneCo]] – [[Industrial Lightspeed]] [[Chevrolet]] in the [[Auto Racing Club of America|ARCA]] [[stock car]] series. He ran in [[NASCAR]] in 2004 and 2005, before returning to ARCA.

== Craftsman Truck Series career ==
Weaver has 24 career starts in the Truck Series. Running his #20 PhoneCo Chevy, Weaver made his debut in the [[2003 in NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2003]] race at [[Mesa Marin Raceway]]. It was a decent first race, as Weaver started 26th and finished 29th. However, Weaver improved. In three of the next four races, Weaver finished in the top 10, highlighted by a career best of 5th coming at California Speedway and Daytona International Speedway

Those runs earned him a new ride in [[2004 in NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2004]], driving a [[Green Light Racing]] #08 Chevy, with funding from PhoneCo. He had a best of 8th at [[Texas Motor Speedway|Texas]] and by midseason, Weaver was scaled back to a limited schedule. However, Weaver did manage a new career best start of 16th at [[Milwaukee Mile]] and finished in the top 10.

Weaver continued to race in the trucks in [[2005 in NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2005]]. This time at Daytona, he scored his 4th career top-10 with a 6th at Daytona. Weaver made three more races in 2005. He did not finish two of the three races, and his best finish was an 8th at Atlanta Motor Speedway.

== ARCA career ==
Since joining the series in 2002, Weaver had been a decent driver, earning mid-pack results. However, recently, in 2005 and 2006, Weaver has improved significantly, highlighted by 15 top 10s and four 2nd-place finishes in 2005. He drove the #20 PhoneCo Dodge for the 2006 season.

== Business career ==

Ken Weaver purchased Freedom Power Electric in 2006 which provides pre-paid electricity to Texas consumers with credit problems.

'''Küresünni''' are an ethnic group of [[Turkic people]] who settle in the territory of former [[Salmas County]], [[Urmia County]],  [[Khoy County]],  [[Maku County]] in [[Iran]] and [[Van Province]] in Turkey. It is believed that they descend from [[Chepni]] tribesmen who were settled in the region by the [[Ottoman Empire]] to serve against the [[Qizilbash]]. Küresünni, from the [[Shafi'i]] ''[[madh'hab]]'', continue to be fervent [[Sunnis]]. In the southwest of Khoy, there are Kurdicized&lt;ref name="iranica" /&gt; groups of Küresünni Turks.

Following their conflict with [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] leader [[Simko Shikak]] in 1921, a group of Küresünni took refuge in [[Van Province]] of [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://guneyazerbaycankurtsorunu.blogcu.com/kuresunniler-ve-1921-de-turkiyeye-gocleri/1987883 Güney Azerbaycan ve Kürt Sorunu]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31622">[[File:2 Young Women.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tintype]] of two young women in [[Lowell Massachusetts|Lowell]], [[Massachusetts]]]]
The '''Lowell Mill Girls''' were young female workers who came to work in industrial corporations in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], [[Massachusetts]], during the [[Industrial Revolution in the United States]]. The workers initially recruited by the corporations were daughters of propertied New England farmers, typically between the ages of 15 and 35.&lt;ref name="homblog"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=Rebecca Beatrice|title=What Was the Lowell System Used in the Lowell Mills?|url=http://historyofmassachusetts.org/lowell-mills-factory-system/|accessdate=27 January 2018|work=History of Massachusetts Blog|date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1840, at the height of the Industrial Revolution, the [[textile mills]] had recruited over 8,000 women, who came to make up nearly three-quarters of the mill workforce.

During the early period, women came to the mills of their own accord, for various reasons: to help a brother pay for college, for the educational opportunities offered in Lowell, or to earn supplementary income. Francis Cabot Lowell, specifically emphasized the importance of providing housing and a form of education to mirror the boarding schools that were emerging in the 19th century. He also wanted to provide an environment that sharply contrasted the poor conditions of the British Mills. While their wages were only half of what men were paid, many women able to attain economic independence for the first time, free from controlling fathers and husbands. On average, the Lowell Mill Girls earned between three and four dollars per week. The cost of boarding ranged between seventy-five cents and $1.25, leaving a portion of their pay to themselves. As a result, while factory life would soon come to be viewed as oppressive, it enabled these women to challenge [[gender stereotype]]s. Women were also hired because some factory owners, such as Lowell, were less inclined to hire children for this lesser pay.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist Jr., H. E. “The Boston Manufacturing Company and Anglo-American Relations 1807–1820.” ''Business History 15'', no. 1 (January 1973): 45. https://ezproxy.simmons.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=31h&amp;AN=5954394&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the nature of the new "factory system" became clear, however, many women joined the broader [[Labor history of the United States|American labor movement]], to protest the dramatic social changes of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. While they decried the deteriorating factory conditions, worker unrest in the 1840s was directed mainly against the loss of control over economic life. This loss of control, which came with the dependence on the corporations for a wage, was experienced as an attack on their dignity and independence. Though they lost strike after strike, Labor historian Philip Foner noted, observed, “they succeeded in raising serious questions about woman’s so-called ‘place’.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Myth of the Mill Girls|url= https://www.theattic.space/home-page-blogs/2018/8/30/the-myth-of-the-mill-girls |website=The Attic|accessdate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, after a number of protests and strikes, many operatives came together to form the first union of working women in the United States, the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association. The Association adopted a newspaper called the ''[[Voice of Industry]]'', in which workers published sharp critiques of the new industrialism. The ''Voice'' stood in sharp contrast to other literary magazines published by female operatives, such as the ''[[Lowell Offering]]'', which painted a sanguine picture of life in the mills.

In 1813, businessman [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]] formed a company, the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]], and built a textile mill next to the [[Charles River]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], Massachusetts. Unlike the earlier [[Rhode Island System]], where only [[carding]] and [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] were done in a factory while the weaving was often put out to neighboring farms to be done by hand, the Waltham mill was the first integrated mill in the United States, transforming raw [[cotton]] into cotton [[cloth]] in one building.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist Jr., H. E. “The Boston Manufacturing Company and Anglo-American Relations 1807–1820.” ''Business History 15'', no. 1 (January 1973): 45. https://ezproxy.simmons.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=31h&amp;AN=5954394&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821, Francis C. Lowell's business associates, looking to expand the Waltham textile operations, purchased land around the [[Pawtucket Falls (Massachusetts)|Pawtucket Falls]] on the [[Merrimack River]] in East Chelmsford. Incorporated as the Town of Lowell in 1826, by 1840, the textile mills employed almost 8,000 workers — mostly women between the ages of 15 and 35.&lt;ref name="dublin"&gt;Dublin, Thomas (1975).[http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/whole_cloth/u2ei/u2materials/dublin.html "Women, Work, and Protest in the Early Lowell Mills: 'The Oppressing Hand of Avarice Would Enslave Us'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227063040/http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/whole_cloth/u2ei/u2materials/dublin.html |date=2009-02-27 }}.

The "City of Spindles", as Lowell came to be known, quickly became the center of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in America. New, large scale machinery, which had come to dominate the production of cloth by 1840, was being rapidly developed in lockstep with the equally new ways of organizing workers for mass production. Together, these mutually reinforcing technological and social changes produced staggering increases: between 1840 and 1860, the number of spindles in use went from 2.25 million to almost 5.25 million; bales of cotton used from 300,000 to nearly 1 million, and the number of workers from 72,000 to nearly 122,000.&lt;ref&gt;Lowell (Mass.).

This tremendous growth translated directly into large profits for the textile corporations: between 1846 and 1850, for instance, the dividends of the Boston-based investors, the group of textile companies that founded Lowell, averaged 14% per year. Most corporations recorded similarly high profits during this period.

The social position of the factory girls had been degraded considerably in France and England. In her autobiography, [[Harriet Hanson Robinson]] (who worked in the Lowell mills from 1834–1848) suggests that "It was to overcome this prejudice that such high wages had been offered to women that they might be induced to become mill girls, in spite of the opprobrium that still clung to this degrading occupation.…" &lt;ref&gt;Harriet Robinson,[http://courses.wcupa.edu/johnson/robinson.html]"THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EARLY FACTORY GIRLS", West Chester University, retrieved November 8, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factory conditions===
The [[Lowell System]] combined large-scale mechanization with an attempt to improve the stature of its female workforce and workers. A few girls who came with their mothers or older sisters were as young as ten years old, some were middle-aged, but the average age was about 24.&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt; Usually hired for contracts of one year (the average stay was about four years), new employees were given assorted tasks as spare hands and paid a fixed daily wage while more experienced loom operators would be paid by the piece. They were paired with more experienced women, who trained them in the ways of the factory.&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt;

Conditions in the Lowell mills were severe by modern American standards. Employees worked from 5:00 am until 7:00 pm, for an average 73 hours per week.&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt; Each room usually had 80 women working at machines, with two male overseers managing the operation. The noise of the machines was described by one worker as "something frightful and infernal", and although the rooms were hot, windows were often kept closed during the summer so that conditions for thread work remained optimal. The air, meanwhile, was filled with particles of thread and cloth.&lt;ref name="assoc"&gt;[http://www.kentlaw.edu/ilhs/lowell.html "A Description of Factory Life by an Associationist in 1846"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416222111/http://www.kentlaw.edu/ilhs/lowell.html |date=2009-04-16 }}.

Retrieved on August 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Dickens]], who visited in 1842, remarked favorably on the conditions: "I cannot recall or separate one young face that gave me a painful impression; not one young girl whom, assuming it to be matter of necessity that she should gain her daily bread by the labour of her hands, I would have removed from those works if I had had the power." &lt;ref name="dickens"&gt;Dickens, Charles (1842). ''American Notes''. New York: The Modern Library. {{ISBN|0-679-60185-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was concern among many workers that foreign visitors were being presented with a sanitized view of the mills, by textile corporations who were trading on the image of the 'literary operative' to mask the grim realities of factory life. "Very pretty picture," wrote an operative named Juliana in the ''[[Voice of Industry]]'', responding to a rosy account of life and learning in the mills, "but we who work in the factory know the sober reality to be quite another thing altogether." The "sober reality" was twelve to fourteen hours of dreary, exhausting work, which many workers experienced as hostile to intellectual development. &lt;ref&gt; National Council for Historical Education, "New England Mill Girls," https://www.backstoryradio.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/02/Mill-Girls-Sources.pdf, accessed November 30, 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Living quarters===
The investors or factory owners built hundreds of [[boarding houses]] near the mills, where textile workers lived year-round. A curfew of 10:00 pm was common, and men were generally not allowed inside. About 26 women lived in each boarding house, with up to six sharing a bedroom.&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt; One worker described her quarters as "a small, comfortless, half-ventilated apartment containing some half a dozen occupants".&lt;ref name="Amelia"&gt;"An Operative" (1845). [http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6217 "Some of the Beauties of our Factory System – Otherwise, Lowell Slavery"]. In ''Factory Tracts. Factory Life As It Is, Number One''. Lowell. Online at the [[Center for History and New Media]]; retrieved August 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Life in these boarding houses was typically strict. The houses were often run by widows who kept a close eye on the workers and made church attendance mandatory for all of the girls. &lt;ref&gt; "Rights of Women", ''The Voice of Industry,''http://www.industrialrevolution.org/rights-of-women.html, accessed November 30, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

Trips away from the boarding house were uncommon; the Lowell girls worked and ate together.  However, half-days and short paid vacations were possible due to the nature of the piece-work; one girl would work the machines of another in addition to her own such that no wages would be lost. These close quarters fostered community as well as resentment. Newcomers were mentored by older women in areas such as dress, speech, behavior, and the general ways of the community. The women became very close with one another due to the extensive time they spent together both during work and after work when they would engage in cultural activities, such as music and literature. &lt;ref&gt; "Rights of Women", ''The Voice of Industry,''http://www.industrialrevolution.org/rights-of-women.html, accessed November 30, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

Workers often recruited their friends or relatives to the factories, creating a familial atmosphere among many of the rank and file.&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt; The Lowell girls were expected to attend church and demonstrate morals befitting proper society. The 1848 ''Handbook to Lowell'' noted that the company would "not employ anyone who is habitually absent from public worship on the Sabbath, or known to be guilty of immorality".&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;Hamilton Manufacturing Company (1848).

===Working-class intellectual culture===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
As for many young women, the allure of Lowell was in the opportunities afforded for further study and learning. Most had already completed some measure of formal education and were resolutely bent on self-improvement. Upon their arrival, they found a vibrant, lively working-class intellectual culture: workers read voraciously in Lowell's city library and reading rooms and subscribed to the large, informal "circulating libraries" which trafficked in novels. Many even pursued literary composition. Defying factory rules, operatives would affix verses to their spinning frames, "to train their memories", and pin-up mathematical problems in the rooms where they worked. In the evenings, many enrolled in courses offered by the mills and attended public lectures at the Lyceum, a theatre built at company expense (offering 25 lectures per season for 25 cents). The ''[[Voice of Industry]]'' is alive with notices for upcoming lectures, courses, and meetings on topics ranging from astronomy to music. [http://voiceofindustry.com/lectures-and-learning.html#topoflecturesandlearning ("Lectures and Learning", ''Voice of Industry'')]

The corporations happily publicized the efforts of these "literary mill girls", boasting that they were the "most superior class of factory operative", impressing foreign visitors. But this masked the bitter opposition of many workers to the 12–14 hours of exhausting, monotonous work, which they saw was corrosive to their desire to learn. As one operative asked in the''Voice'', "who, after thirteen hours of steady application to monotonous work, can sit down and apply her mind to deep and long-continued thought?" Another Lowell operative expressed a similar view: "I well remember the chagrin I often felt when attending lectures, to find myself unable to keep awake...I am sure few possessed a more ardent desire for knowledge than I did, but such was the effect of the long hour system, that my chief delight was, after the evening meal, to place my aching feet in an easy position, and read a novel."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.industrialrevolution.org/the-life-of-the-mind.html "Working Class Intellectual Culture"], ''The Voice of Industry'', retrieved November 8, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Lowell Offering'' ==
[[File:Lowell Offering 1.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''The Lowell Offering'', Series 1, Number 1 (1840)]]
{{Main|Lowell Offering}}

In October 1840, the Reverend Abel Charles Thomas of the First Universalist Church organized a monthly publication by and for the Lowell girls. As the magazine grew in popularity, women contributed poems, ballads, essays, and fiction – often using their characters to report on conditions and situations in their lives.&lt;ref name="Dublin"&gt;Dublin, Thomas. "Women at Work: The Transformation of Work and Community in Lowell, Massachusetts, 1826-1860. New York: Columbia University Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Offering"s contents were by turns serious and farcical. In a letter in the first issue, "A Letter about Old Maids", the author suggested that "sisters, spinsters, lay-nuns, &amp; c" were an essential component of God's "wise design".&lt;ref&gt;"Betsy" (1840).

== Strikes of 1834 and 1836 ==
The initial effort of the investors and managers to recruit female textile workers brought generous wages for the time (three to five dollars per week), but with the economic depression of the early 1830s, the Board of Directors decided to and proposed a reduction in wages. This, in turn, led to organized "turn-outs" or [[Strike action|strikes]].

In February 1834, the Board of Directors of Lowell's textile mills requested a 15% wage reduction, to go into effect on March 1. After a series of meetings, the female textile workers organized a "turn-out" or strike. The women involved in "turn-out" immediately withdrew their savings, causing "a run" on two local banks.&lt;ref name="transcript"&gt;''Boston Transcript'' (1834). Online at [http://www.library.csi.cuny.edu/dept/americanstudies/lavender/liberty.html "'Liberty Rhetoric' and Nineteenth-Century American Women"]. Retrieved on August 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The strike failed and within days the protesters had all returned to work at reduced pay or left town, but the "turn-out" or strike was an indication of the determination among the Lowell female textile workers to take labor action. This dismayed the agents of the factories, who portrayed the turnout as a betrayal of [[femininity]]. William Austin, agent of the Lawrence Manufacturing Company, wrote to his Board of Directors, "notwithstanding the friendly and disinterested advice which has been on all proper {{sic|occas|sions}} communicated to the girls of the Lawrence mills a spirit of evil omen&amp;nbsp; … has prevailed, and overcome the judgment and discretion of too many".&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt;

Again, in response to a severe economic depression and the high costs of living, in January 1836, the Board of Directors of Lowell's textile mills absorbed an increase in the textile workers' rent to help in the crisis faced by the company boarding house keepers. As the economic calamity continued in October 1836, the Directors proposed an additional rent hike to be paid by the textile workers living in the company boarding houses.&lt;ref&gt;Faragher, John Mack, et al. ''Out Of Many''. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Pearson Hall, 2006. Pg 346&lt;/ref&gt; The female textile workers responded immediately in protest by forming the Factory Girls' Association and organizing a "turn-out" or strike.
[[Harriet Hanson Robinson]], an eleven-year-old [[doffer]] at the time of the strike, recalled in her memoirs: "One of the girls stood on a pump and gave vent to the feelings of her companions in a neat speech, declaring that it was their duty to resist all attempts at cutting down the wages. This was the first time a woman had spoken in public in Lowell, and the event caused surprise and consternation among her audience."&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt;

This "turn-out" or strike attracted over 1,500 workers – nearly twice the number two years previously - causing Lowell's textile mills to run far below capacity.&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt; Unlike the "turn-out" or strike in 1834, in 1836 there was enormous community support for the striking female textile workers. The proposed rent hike was seen as a violation of the written contract between the employers and the employees. The "turn-out" persisted for weeks and eventually the Board of Directors of Lowell's textile mills rescinded the rent hike. Although the "turn-out" was a success, the weakness of the system was evident, and worsened further in the [[Panic of 1837]].

The sense of community that arose from working and living together contributed directly to the energy and growth of the first union of women workers, the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association. Started by 12 operatives in January 1845, its membership grew to 500 within six months, and continued to expand rapidly. The Association was run completely by the women themselves: they elected their own officers and held their own meetings; they helped organize the city's female workers, and set up branches in other mill towns. They organized fairs, parties, and social gatherings. Unlike many middle-class women activists, the operatives found considerable support from working-class men who welcomed them into their reform organizations and advocated for their treatment as equals.

One of its first actions was to send petitions signed by thousands of textile workers to the [[Massachusetts General Court]] demanding a ten-hour work day. In response, the Massachusetts Legislature established a committee chaired by William Schouler, Representative from Lowell, to investigate and hold public hearings, during which workers testified about conditions in the factories and the physical demands of their twelve-hour days. These were the first investigations into labor conditions by a governmental body in the United States.&lt;ref name="zinn"&gt;Zinn, Howard (1980). ''A People's History of the United States'', p. 225. New York: HarperPerennial. {{ISBN|0-06-092643-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1845 Legislative Committee determined that it was not state legislature's responsibility to control the hours of work. The LFLRA called its chairman, William Schouler, a "tool"&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt; and worked to defeat him in his next campaign for the State Legislature.&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt; A complex election&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=Se3CBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22complex+election%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HJ1WAEeMgE&amp;sig=DkVgrGXqQkLckoVKC4RdcdZS3as&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCGoVChMI_Jbdp675xwIVBy6ICh1pYwCu#v=onepage&amp;q=%22complex%20election%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Schouler lost to another Whig candidate over the issue of railroads. The impact of working men [Democrats] and working women [non-voting] was very limited. The next year Schouler was re-elected to the State Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Cowley, Illustrated History of Lowell.  Boston: Lee and Shepard, 1868&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lowell female textile workers continued to petition the Massachusetts Legislature and legislative committee hearings became an annual event. Although the initial push for a ten-hour workday was unsuccessful, the LFLRA continued to grow, affiliating with the New England Workingmen's Association and publishing articles in that organization's ''[[Voice of Industry]]'', a pro-labor newspaper.&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt; This direct pressure forced the Board of Directors of Lowell's textile mills to reduce the workday by 30 minutes in 1847. The FLRA's organizing efforts spilled over into other nearby towns.&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt; In 1847, New Hampshire became the first state to pass a law for a ten-hour workday, although there was no enforcement and workers were often requested to work longer days. By 1848, the LFLRA dissolved as a labor reform organization. Lowell textile workers continued to petition and pressure for improved working conditions,&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt; and in 1853, the Lowell corporations reduced the workday to eleven hours.

The New England textile industry was rapidly expanding in the 1850s and 1860s. Unable to recruit enough Yankee women to fill all the new jobs, to supplement the workforce textile managers turned to survivors of the [[Great Irish Famine]] who had recently immigrated to the United States in large numbers. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], many of Lowell's cotton mills closed, unable to acquire bales of raw cotton from the South.  After the war, the textile mills reopened, recruiting French Canadian men and women. Although large numbers of Irish and French Canadian immigrants moved to Lowell to work in the textile mills, Yankee women still dominated the workforce until the mid-1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Layer, ''Earnings of Cotton Mill Operatives, 1825-1914''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political character of labor activity ==
The Lowell girls' organizing efforts were notable not only for the "unfeminine" participation of women, but also for the political framework used to appeal to the public. Framing their struggle for shorter work days and better pay as a matter of rights and personal dignity, they sought to place themselves in the larger context of the [[American Revolution]]. During the 1834 "turn-out" or strike – they warned that "the oppressing hand of avarice would enslave us,"&lt;ref name="dublin"/&gt; the women included a poem which read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Let oppression shrug her shoulders,
And a haughty tyrant frown,
And little upstart Ignorance,
In mockery look down.
Yet I value not the feeble threats
Of Tories in disguise,
While the flag of Independence
O'er our noble nation flies.&lt;ref name="cuny"&gt;Quoted in [http://www.library.csi.cuny.edu/dept/americanstudies/lavender/liberty.html "'Liberty Rhetoric' and Nineteenth-Century American Women"]. Retrieved on August 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1836 strike, this theme returned in a protest song:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Oh! isn't it a pity, such a pretty girl as I
Should be sent to the factory to pine away and die?
Oh! I cannot be a slave, I will not be a slave,
For I'm so fond of liberty,
That I cannot be a slave.&lt;ref name="cuny"/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most striking example of this political overtone can be found in a series of tracts published by the Female Labor Reform Association entitled ''Factory Tracts''. In the first of these, subtitled "Factory Life As It Is", the author proclaims "that our rights cannot be trampled upon with impunity; that we WILL not longer submit to that arbitrary power which has for the last ten years been so abundantly exercised over us."&lt;ref name="Amelia" /&gt;

This conceptualization of [[labor activist|labor activity]] as philosophically linked with the American project in democracy has been instrumental for other labor organizing campaigns, as noted frequently by MIT professor and social critic [[Noam Chomsky]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people2/Chomsky/chomsky-con5.html Activism, Anarchy, and Power]. Interview by Harry Kreisler. 22 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; who has cited this extended quote from the Lowell Mill Girls on the topic of [[wage slavery]]:

{{quote|When you sell your product, you retain your person. But when you sell your labour, you sell yourself, losing the rights of free men and becoming vassals of mammoth establishments of a monied aristocracy that threatens annihilation to anyone who questions their right to enslave and oppress.

Those who work in the mills ought to own them, not have the status of machines ruled by private despots who are entrenching monarchic principles on democratic soil as they drive downwards freedom and rights, civilization, health, morals and intellectuality in the new commercial feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economicdemocracy.org/lowell.html "Chomsky quoting Lowell Mill Girls"] from p. 29, ''Chomsky on Democracy and Education'', edited by C.P. Otero&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Marshall Cassidy''' (born 1945) is an [[United States|American]] [[Thoroughbred]] racing official based in [[New York State]], and a former [[public address]] announcer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/13/sports/horse-racing-open-mind-does-the-impossible.html |title=HORSE RACING; Open Mind Does the Impossible |last=Crist|first=Steven|date=13 August 1989 |newspaper=The New York Times |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sportscaster]]. Cassidy is currently a patrol and placing judge for the [[New York Racing Association]], and has also served as an alternate steward.

Cassidy is best known for the 18 years he spent as one of the race callers for NYRA, at [[Aqueduct Racetrack]], [[Belmont Park]] and [[Saratoga Race Course]]. He worked as backup track announcer to [[Dave Johnson (announcer)|Dave Johnson]] and [[Chic Anderson]]. Cassidy became lead announcer after the death of Anderson in March 1979.

Cassidy was the most prominent announcer in racing in the early to mid-1980s, not only for his on-track work but also as a sportscaster calling races for [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] radio, [[CBS]] television, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television, [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] television and [[ESPN]] television.  He was best known for his accuracy, precise diction and upbeat delivery, especially early in his career when calling a close race as the horses ran down the stretch.

Cassidy remained the lead race caller for NYRA until 1990, when he was replaced by track announcer [[Tom Durkin]].  Cassidy called the fourth race at Saratoga Race Course on September 1, 2008.  The race was won by Tommasi.

==Personal==
He is part of a well-known family of racing officials. His maternal grandfather, Marshall Whiting Cassidy, was a race starter and later steward who eventually became racing director for NYRA’s predecessor agencies, and later executive director of [[The Jockey Club]].

The current Marshall Cassidy's maternal great-grandfather, Marshall (Mars) Cassidy, was also a fixture in New York racing as a race starter and the first to use a barrier to start a race.

George Cassidy, the grand-uncle of the current Marshall Cassidy, was a race starter for some five decades (mostly at the NYRA tracks) until he retired late December 1980.

'''Military branch''' (also '''service branch''' or '''armed service''') is according to common standard the subdivision of the national [[armed forces]] of a sovereign nation or state.

==Branches==
===Classical branches===
In classical NATO terminology, the three basic environmental commands military branches are the [[Army]], [[Air Force]], and [[Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;''STANAG 2116: NATO Codes for Grades of Military Personnel.'' NATO. 13 March 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Fleet 5 nations.jpg|&lt;center&gt;'''Navy'''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Specialized branches ===
Countries which do not have access to any of the [[brown water]], [[green water]], [[blue water]] or any oceans generally do not have a national navy.

In some countries there might be other military branches. In addition to the above-mentioned military branches, examples are:

* In [[Argentina]] the [[Argentine National Gendarmerie|National Gendarmerie]] and the [[Argentine Naval Prefecture|Naval Prefecture]]
* In [[China]] the [[People's Liberation Army Rocket Force|Rocket Force]] and the [[People's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force|Strategic Support Force]]
* In [[France]] the [[National Gendarmerie]] and the [[French National Guard|National Guard]]
* In [[Germany]] the [[Bundeswehr Joint Medical Service|Joint Medical Service]], the [[Streitkräftebasis|Joint Support Service]] and the [[Cyber and Information Space Command (Germany)|Cyber and Information Space Command]]
* In [[Italy]] the [[Carabinieri]]
* In [[Norway]] the [[Home Guard (Norway)|Home Guard]] and the [[Norwegian Cyber Defence Force|Cyber Defence Force]]
* In [[Poland]] the [[Polish Special Forces|Special Forces]]
* In [[Russia]] the [[Russian Airborne Troops|Airborne Troops]] and the [[Strategic Missile Troops]]
* In [[South Africa]] the [[South African Military Health Service|Military Health Service]] 
* In [[South Korea]] the [[Republic of Korea Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]
* In [[Taiwan]] the [[Republic of China Military Police|Military Police]]
* In the [[United States]] the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] and the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Historical development ==
The military branches came into being in line with military technical progress and have been developed permanently. With that background, the air force was established early in the 20th century as one of the latest armed service.

The army is traditionally the oldest – and in many countries the biggest armed service.

=== Unified forces ===
The [[Canadian Armed Forces]] is the unified armed forces of Canada. While it has three environmental commands - namely [[Royal Canadian Navy]], [[Canadian Army]] and [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] - it remains a single military service.

===NATO definition===
''Branch of service'' (also ''branch of military service'' or ''branch of armed service'') refers, according to NATO standards, to a branch, employment of combined forces or parts of a [[Military service|service]], below the level of service, military serviced or armed service.&lt;ref&gt;MILITÄRISCHES STUDIENGLOSAR ENGLISCH Teil I, A – K, Bundessprachenamt (Stand Januar 2001), page 226, definition: branch of service.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Livorno, Monumento dei quattro mori a Ferdinando II (1626) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 13-4-2006 01.jpg|thumb|The Monument of the Four Moors]]

The '''Monument of the Four Moors''' ({{Lang-it|Monumento dei Quattro mori}}) is located in [[Livorno]], Italy. It was  completed in 1626 to commemorate the victories of [[Ferdinand I of Tuscany]] over the [[Ottomans]].&lt;ref name="BindmanGates2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Bindman|author2=Henry Louis Gates|author3=Karen C. C. Dalton|title=The Image of the Black in Western Art: From the "Age of Discovery" to the Age of Abolition : artists of the Renaissance and Baroque|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AK_mZsynJ6IC&amp;pg=PA183|year=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05261-1|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the most famous monument of Livorno and is located in Piazza Micheli.&lt;ref name="Italy2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Touring Club of Italy|title=Authentic Tuscany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gu9Ev_4PL5oC&amp;pg=PA52|year=2005|publisher=Touring Editore|isbn=978-88-365-3297-1|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Created by [[Pietro Tacca]], the monument takes its name from the four bronze statues of "[[Moors|Moorish]]" slaves that are found at the base of   an earlier work consisting of the statue of Ferdinando I and its monumental pedestal.&lt;ref name="Italy2005"/&gt;

==History==
In 1617, [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo II]] contracted sculptor [[Pietro Tacca]] to create the monument to commemorate his father, [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando I]]. The completed monument was installed in Livorno in 1626.&lt;ref name="BindmanGates2010"/&gt; It features four bronze statues of enslaved prisoners chained at the base of a statue of Ferdinando I which had been commissioned at an earlier date.&lt;ref name="BindmanGates2010"/&gt; The physical characteristics of three of the statues represent people of the southern [[Mediterranean coast]] while the fourth statue has characteristics of a black African.&lt;ref name="BindmanGates2010"/&gt;

Although the four chained prisoners are meant to represent the victories of Ferdinando I over the Ottomans, there may also be a different interpretation due to the presence of the statue with the black African characteristics; [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando II]], grandson of Ferdinando I, completed the monument and he may also have been involved in [[slave trade]] activities in West Africa in the 1660s, in cooperation with the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoan]]s.&lt;ref name="BindmanGates2010"/&gt; 

The four Moors symbolise the [[four corners of the world]].&lt;ref name="Scigliano2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Scigliano|title=Michelangelo's Mountain: The Quest For Perfection in the Marble Quarries of Carrara|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKDeyBjXzB8C&amp;pg=PA138|date=1 November 2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-9135-1|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tacca's design of the Moors monument is assumed to have been influenced by three columns in the shape of African men supporting a balcony in Via Carriona in [[Carrara]]. The three sculptures are depicted as suffering from the weight they bear supporting the iron structure.&lt;ref name="Scigliano2007" /&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Livorno Quattro mori monument 07.JPG|thumb|upright|Detail of the monument showing the statue with black African characteristics]]
The monument of the four Moors influenced sculptural design for several decades. A fountain in [[Marino, Lazio|Marino]] features four statues of similarly chained prisoners, two of whom possess black African characteristics. The structure was constructed between 1632–1642 to commemorate [[Marcantonio Colonna]]'s participation in the battle of Lepanto in 1571 which led to the defeat of the Ottomans.&lt;ref name="BindmanGates2010"/&gt; 

The monument of the four Moors also influenced [[Bernini]]'s creation of the ''[[Fountain of the Four Rivers]]'' (''Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi''). Bernini may have also been influenced by the Marino monument in his design of the Fountain.&lt;ref name="BindmanGates2010" /&gt;

The ostentatious design of the tomb of [[Doge]] [[Giovanni Pesaro]], which was built in 1669 in Venice, and is found in [[Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]] close to the [[Pesaro Madonna|Pesaro Altarpiece]], was perhaps strongly influenced by Tacca's monument of the four Moors.&lt;ref name="Harper2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

[[File:Frances Benjamin Johnston, Self-Portrait (as "New Woman"), 1896.jpg|thumb|[[Frances Benjamin Johnston]]'s ''Self-Portrait (as "New Woman")'', 1896.]]

The '''New Woman''' was a [[feminism|feminist]] ideal that emerged in the late nineteenth century and had a profound influence on feminism well into the twentieth century. The term "New Woman" was coined by writer [[Charles Reade]] in his novel "A Woman Hater", originally published serially in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'' and in three volumes in 1877. Of particular interest in the context are Chapters XIV and XV in volume two, which made the case for the equal treatment of women and arguably sparked off the whole Women's Movement in the latter part of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=A Woman Hater Vol. II, pp.[1] - 74, and p.149|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, Irish writer [[Sarah Grand]] used the term "new woman" in an influential article, to refer to independent women seeking radical change, and in response the English writer '[[Ouida]]' (Maria Louisa Rame) used the term as the title of a follow-up article.&lt;ref&gt;See Sally Ledger, 'The New Woman: Fiction and Feminism at the Fin de Siecle', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was further popularized by British-American writer [[Henry James]], who used it to describe the growth in the number of feminist, educated, independent career women in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevens|first=Hugh|title=Henry James and Sexuality|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521089852|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independence was not simply a matter of the mind: it also involved physical changes in activity and dress, as activities such as bicycling expanded women's ability to engage with a broader more active world.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts |first1=Jacob |title=Women's work |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=6–11 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/womens-work|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Woman pushed the limits set by a [[androcentrism|male-dominated]] society, especially as modeled in the plays of Norwegian [[Henrik Ibsen]] (1828–1906).

==Changing social roles==
[[File:Their First Quarrel, Gibson.jpg|thumb|''Their First Quarrel'' (1914), an illustration by [[Charles Dana Gibson]]. The [[Gibson Girl]] was a glamorous version of the New Woman, shown here keeping her back turned to her [[suitor]] as they both pretend to read.]]
Writer [[Henry James]] was among the authors who popularized the term "New Woman", a figure who was represented in the heroines of his novels—among them the title character of the novella ''[[Daisy Miller]]'' (serialized 1878), and Isabel Archer in ''[[Portrait of a Lady]]'' (serialized 1880–81). According to historian Ruth Bordin, the term New Woman was {{blockquote|intended by [James] to characterize American expatriates living in Europe: women of affluence and sensitivity, who despite or perhaps because of their wealth exhibited an independent spirit and were accustomed to acting on their own. The term New Woman always referred to women who exercised control over their own lives be it personal, social, or economic.&lt;ref name="Bordin 1993 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordin|first=Ruth Birgitta Anderson|title=Alice Freeman Palmer: The Evolution of a New Woman|year=1993|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472103928|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

The "New Woman" was also a nickname given to [[Ella Hepworth Dixon]], the English author of the novel ''[[The Story of a Modern Woman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;ODNB entry for Ella Hepworth Dixon, by Nicola Beauman. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/56958. Retrieved 25 July 2013. Pay-walled.]; London: W. Heinemann, 1894. ''[[The Story of a Modern Woman]]'', ed. Steve Farmer (Toronto: Broadview Literary Texts, 2004). {{ISBN|1551113805}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postsecondary and professional education===
[[File:Florence Bascom2.jpg|thumb|[[Geology|Geologist]] [[Florence Bascom]] was typical of the New Woman. She was the first woman to earn a Ph.D. from [[Johns Hopkins University]] (1893) and, in 1894, the first woman elected to the [[Geological Society of America]].]]
Although the New Woman was becoming a more active participant in life as a member of society and the workforce, she was most often depicted exerting her autonomy in the domestic and private spheres in literature, theatre, and other artistic representations.&lt;ref name="Bordin 1993 2"/&gt; The 19th-century [[suffragette]] movement to gain women's democratic rights was the most significant influence on the New Woman. Education and employment opportunities for women were increasing as western countries became more urban and industrialized. The "[[pink collar|pink-collar]]" workforce gave women a foothold in the business and institutional sphere. In 1870, women in the professions comprised only 6.4 percent of the United States' non-agricultural workforce; by 1910, that figure had risen to 10 percent, then to 13.3 percent in 1920.&lt;ref name="Lavender"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lavender|first=Catherine|title=Notes on The New Woman|url=https://csivc.csi.cuny.edu/history/files/lavender/386/newwoman.pdf|publisher=The College of Staten Island/CUNY|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More women were winning the right to attend university or college. Some were obtaining a professional education and becoming lawyers, doctors, journalists, and professors, often at prestigious all-female colleges such as the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] schools: [[Barnard College|Barnard]], [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke]], [[Radcliffe College|Radcliffe]], [[Smith College|Smith]], [[Vassar College|Vassar]], and [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]]. The New Woman in the United States was participating in post-secondary education in larger numbers by the turn of the 20th century. [[Alice Freeman Palmer]] became Wellesley's first woman president in 1881, while Mount Holyoke had elected female leadership since its founding in 1837.

===Sexuality and social expectations===
[[File:The new woman--wash day-crop.png|thumb|A satirical photo from 1901, with the caption "New Woman—Wash Day". Shown is a woman wearing [[Knickerbockers (clothing)|knickerbockers]] and knee socks (traditional male attire) and smoking a cigarette, supervising as a man (who appears to be wearing a dress and an apron) does the laundry with a tub and washboard.]]
Autonomy was a radical goal for women at the end of the 19th century. It was historically a truism that women were always legally and economically dependent on their husband, male relatives, or social and charitable institutions. The emergence of education and career opportunities for women in the late 19th century, as well as new legal rights to property (although not yet the vote), meant that they stepped into a new position of freedom and choice when it came to marital and sexual partners. The New Woman placed great importance on her sexual autonomy, but that was difficult to put into practice as society still voiced loud disapproval of any sign of female licentiousness. For [[women in the Victorian era]], any sexual activity outside of marriage was judged to be immoral. Divorce law changes during the late 19th century gave rise to a New Woman who could survive a divorce with her economic independence intact, and an increasing number of divorced women remarried. Maintaining social respectability while exercising legal rights still judged to be immoral by many was a challenge for the New Woman: {{blockquote|[[Mary Heaton Vorse]] put her compromise this way: "I am trying for nothing so hard in my own personal life as how not to be respectable when married."&lt;ref name="Lavender"/&gt;}}

It was clear in the novels of Henry James that however free his heroines felt to exercise their intellectual and sexual autonomy, they ultimately paid a price for their choices.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

Some admirers of the New Woman trend found freedom to engage in lesbian relationships through their networking in women's groups. It has been said that for some of them, "loving other women became a way to escape what they saw as the probabilities of male domination inherent in a heterosexual relationship".&lt;ref name="Lavender"/&gt; For others, it may have been the case that economic independence meant that they were not answerable to a guardian for their sexual or other relationship choices, and they exercised that new freedom.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

===Class differences===
The New Woman was a result of the growing respectability of postsecondary education and employment for women who belonged to the privileged upper classes of society. University education itself was still a badge of affluence for men at the turn of the 20th century, and fewer than 10 percent of people in the United States had a postsecondary education during the era.{{citation needed|date = June 2015}}

The women entering universities generally belonged to the white middle class. Consequentially, the working class, people of color, and immigrants were often left behind in the race to achieve this new feminist model. Woman writers belonging to these marginalized communities often critiqued the way in which their newfound freedom regarding their gender came at the expense of their race, ethnicity, or class. Although they acknowledged and respected the independence of the New Woman, they could not ignore the issue that the standards for a New Woman of the Progressive Era could, for the most part, only be attained by white middle class women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transcending the New Woman: Multiethnic Narratives in the Progressive Era|last=Rich|first=Charlotte|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-8262-6663-7|location=Colombia, United States|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Literary discussions of the expanding potential for women in English society date back at least to [[Maria Edgeworth]]'s ''[[Belinda (Edgeworth novel)|Belinda]]'' (1801) and [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth Barrett's]] ''[[Aurora Leigh]]'' (1856), which explored a woman's plight between conventional marriage and the radical possibility that a woman could become an independent artist. In drama, the late nineteenth century saw such "New Woman" plays as Henrik Ibsen's ''[[A Doll's House]]'' (1879) and ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1890), [[Henry Arthur Jones]]'s play ''The Case of Rebellious Susan'' (1894) and [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s controversial ''[[Mrs. Warren's Profession]]'' (1893) and ''[[Candida (play)|Candida]]'' (1898). 
According to a joke by [[Max Beerbohm]] (1872–1956), "The New Woman sprang fully armed from Ibsen's brain"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/cs6/newwoman.html The New Woman]"&lt;/ref&gt; (an allusion to the birth of [[Athena]]).

[[Bram Stoker]]'s [[Dracula]] makes prominent mention of the New Woman in its pages, with its two main female characters discussing the changing roles of women and the New Woman in particular. Mina Harker goes on to embody several characteristics of the New Woman, employing skills such as typing and deductive reasoning, to the amusement of the older male characters. Lucy Westrenra wonders if the New Woman could marry several men at once, which shocks her friend, Mina. Feminist analyses of ''Dracula'' regard male anxiety about the Woman Question and female sexuality as central to the book.&lt;ref name="Bjørklund"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bjørklund|first1=Miriam|title="To face it like a man": Exploring Male Anxiety in Dracula and the Sherlock Holmes Canon|url=https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/41485/bjorklund_master.pdf?sequence=1|website=Thesis, University of Oslo|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fiction, New Woman writers included [[Olive Schreiner]], [[Annie Sophie Cory]] (Victoria Cross), [[Sarah Grand]], [[Mona Caird]], [[George Egerton]], [[Ella D'Arcy]] and [[Ella Hepworth Dixon]]. Some examples of New Woman literature are Victoria Cross's ''[[Anna Lombard]]'' (1901), Dixon's ''[[The Story of a Modern Woman]]'' and [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[Ann Veronica]]'' (1909).

[[Kate Chopin]]'s ''The Awakening'' (1899) also deserves mention, especially within the context of narratives derived from Flaubert's ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' (1856), both of which chronicle a woman's doomed search for independence and self-realization through sexual experimentation.

The emergence of the fashion-oriented and party-going [[flapper]] in the 1920s marks the end of the New Woman era (now also known as [[First-wave feminism]]).

Women artists became part of professional enterprises, including founding their own art associations. Artwork made by women was considered to be inferior, and to help overcome that stereotype women became "increasingly vocal and confident" in promoting women's work, and thus became part of the emerging image of the educated, modern and freer "New Woman".&lt;ref&gt;Laura R.

In the late nineteenth century [[Charles Dana Gibson]] depicted the "New Woman" in his painting, ''The Reason Dinner was Late'', which is "a sympathetic portrayal of artistic aspiration on the part of young women" as she paints a visiting policeman.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Mowall Mathews.

Retrieved March 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists "played crucial roles in representing the New Woman, both by drawing images of the icon and exemplyfying this emerging type through their own lives". In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries about 88% of the subscribers of 11,000 magazines and periodicals were women. As women entered the artist community, publishers hired women to create illustrations that depicted the world through a woman's perspective. Successful illustrators included [[Jennie Augusta Brownscombe]], [[Jessie Wilcox Smith]], [[Rose O'Neill]], [[Elizabeth Shippen Green]], and [[Violet Oakley]].&lt;ref&gt;Laura R. Prieto.

During the nineteenth century there were a significant number of women who became successful, educated artists, a rarity before that time, with the exception of a few like [[Angelica Kauffman]] (1741–1807) and [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]] (1755–1842).&lt;ref name="Stott p. 75"&gt;Annette Stott.

'''6''': 2 (Spring, 1992). p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The emerging women artists created works with a different perspective than men who represented the feminine in floral depictions of passivity, ornamentality and sexual purity; challenged the limited concepts of femininity; and created a genre of floral-female paintings in which "the artist placed one woman or more in a flower garden setting and manipulated composition, color, texture and form to make the women look as much like flowers as possible" but with a different viewpoint of what feminine meant. The approach was not used for portraits. Its form of feminine representation has largely gone unrecognized by American art scholars and conservative society, ignored in response to the burgeoning "New Woman" beginning in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Annette Stott. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3109092 "Floral Femininity: A Pictorial Definition".] ''American Art.'' The University of Chicago Press.

== Commentary ==
{{quote|The new woman, in the sense of the best woman, the flower of all the womanhood of past ages, has come to stay &amp;mdash; if civilization is to endure. The sufferings of the past have but strengthened her, maternity has deepened her, education is broadening her &amp;mdash; and she now knows that she must perfect herself if she would perfect the race, and leave her imprint upon immortality, through her offspring or her works.|source=[[Winnifred Harper Cooley]]: ''The New Womanhood'' ([[New York, New York|New York]], 1904) 31f.}}

{{quote|I hate that phrase "New Woman." Of all the tawdry, run-to-heel phrases that strikes me the most disagreeably. When you mean, by the term, the women who believe in and ask for the right to advance in education, the arts, and professions with their fellow-men, you are speaking of a phase in civilisation which has come gradually and naturally, and is here to stay. There is nothing new or abnormal in such a woman. But when you confound her with the extremists who wantonly disown the obligations and offices with which nature has honored them, you do the earnest, progressive women great wrong.|source=Emma Wolf, ''The Joy of Life'' (1896).}}

== In Korea ==
In the 1920s, the New Woman's Movement arose among educated Korean women who protested the [[Confucian]] patriarchal tradition. During a period of [[Japanese imperialism]], Christianity was seen as an impetus for [[Christianity in Korea#Korean nationalism|Korean nationalism]] and had been involved in events such as the [[March 1st Movement]] of 1919 for independence. Hence, in contrast to many Western contexts, Christianity informed the ideals of Western feminism and women's education, especially through the [[Ewha Womans University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwon|first=Insook|date=November 1998|title='The New Women's Movement' in 1920s Korea: Rethinking the Relationship Between Imperialism and Women|journal=Gender &amp; History|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=381–405|doi=10.1111/1468-0424.00110|issn=1468-0424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Woman's Movement is often seen to be connected with the Korean magazine ''New Women'' ({{Korean|hangul=신여자|hanja=新女者|rr=|mr=Sin yŏja}}), founded in 1920 by [[Kim Iryeop|Kim Iryŏp]], which included other key figures such as [[Na Hye-sok|Na Hye-sŏk]].&lt;ref name="Choi2012"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EddAmc-SgEUC&amp;pg=PA1|title=New Women in Colonial Korea: A Sourcebook|last=Choi|first=Hyaeweol|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-51709-6|pages=1–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pakistan Association Dubai''' ('''PAD''') is the largest community center for overseas Pakistanis in the world. It was founded in the late 1960s as a platform for advancing the social and cultural interests of Pakistani expatriates residing in [[Dubai]] and more broadly, the [[United Arab Emirates]].

==History==
The Pakistani diaspora in the UAE is the third largest [[overseas Pakistani]] community, and also one of the oldest expatriate groups in the UAE. There are currently over 1.2 million [[Pakistanis in the United Arab Emirates]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/politics/polling-booths-to-be-set-up-across-the-uae-so-pakistanis-can-vote|title=Polling booths to be set up across the UAE so Pakistanis can vote|work=The National|date=8 April 2013|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; out of which over 400,000 are based in Dubai alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/election-looms-for-pakistan-community-group|title=Election looms for Pakistan community group|work=The National|first=Nadeem|last=Hanif|date=8 May 2011|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistanis collectively comprise around 13% of Dubai's population and are the third largest ethnic group in the emirate (after [[Indians in the United Arab Emirates|Indians]] and native [[Emirati people|Emiratis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jandt|first1=Fred E.|title=An Introduction to Intercultural Communication: Identities in a Global Community|date=2012|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781452285757|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; When PAD was founded in the late 1960s by members of the early community, it was initially based at a small rented office space in Murshid Bazar in [[Deira]], where the [[Pakistan Education Academy, Dubai|Pakistan Education Academy]] now exists.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; By the early 1990s, the office was shifted to the Astoria Hotel in [[Bur Dubai]]. Later, the centre where the association is now headquartered was built on [[Oud Metha Road]] in Bur Dubai.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; The objectives of PAD include promoting relations between Pakistan and the UAE, providing community support and welfare, promoting Pakistani culture, organising recreational community events, and enhancing the interests of the Pakistani expatriate community in the UAE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pad.ae/pad-vision/|title=PAD Vision|work=Pakistan Association Dubai|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The association elects a president who formally heads the organisation, typically for a tenure of two to three years. A vice-president, general-secretary and joint-secretary are also elected as part of the executive body. Membership is required to register and participate in the association.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pad.ae/history/|title=History|work=Pakistan Association Dubai|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAD works closely with the [[Consulate-General of Pakistan, Dubai|Consulate-General of Pakistan in Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistanconsulate.ae/association.html|title=Pakistan Associations and Centres in Dubai and Northern Emirates|work=Consulate General of Pakistan, Dubai|accessdate=21 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141124102531/http://www.pakistanconsulate.ae/association.html|archivedate=24 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple community wings operating under PAD.

==Events and activities==
PAD arranges numerous cultural events and gatherings in the community, such as [[Independence Day (Pakistan)|Independence Day]], [[Pakistan Day]] and [[National Day (United Arab Emirates)|UAE National Day]] celebrations, literary events including [[mushaira]]s, [[iftar]] dinners during Ramadan, [[Chaand Raat|chaand raat]] events, [[Meena Bazaar|meena bazaar]]s, fundraising dinners and awareness events, award ceremonies, art exhibitions, sport and leisurely events, as well as workshops and language classes.

==History==
The first Pogopalooza was held in 2004 in a parking lot in [[Nebraska]], organized by [[Dan Brown (blogger)|Dan Brown]], one of the original Xpogo founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pogo Athletes Building Brand New Extreme Sport|url=http://orangeleader.com/v?vid=ndn-23788117&amp;sid=AP%20Editors%20Picks|publisher=The Orange Leader|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the event was small in scope and only drew friends and family, it set the precedent to hold an annual event bringing together extreme pogo athletes from around the country, and eventually the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pogopalooza History|url=http://www.xpogo.com/pogopalooza-history/pogopalooza-1/|publisher=Xpogo.com|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each year since Pogopalooza 1, the event grew in scope and design.  Gaining more structure, media attention, athlete attendance, Pogopalooza progressed steadily for 5 years.  Pogopalooza 6 in 2009, which was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania saw the biggest turnout of athletes yet, over 50+ from across the United States, Canada, and England and involved the whole of the City through four days of events and competition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|last=Maher|first=Kris|title=Boing!

[[The Wall Street Journal]] ran a front-page article on the sport and numerous other countrywide and even international publications began covering athletes, events, and the growth of Xpogo in general.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;  Pogopalooza 7, 8, and 9 represented steady progress as well, leading up to Pogopalooza 10, which stood as another breakout year.   Widely attended and heavily covered, Pogopalooza 10 occurred in New York City across July 26-28th, 2013.  After the event, organizers announced that the Pogopalooza competition would be expanded into a multi-city international touring format for 2014.  Today, the event is referred to as "Pogopalooza: The Xpogo World Championship Series" and occurs multiple times throughout the year in cities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pogopalooza Website|url=http://www.Pogopalooza.com|work=WebPage History|publisher=Xpogo LLC|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Course design and construction===
Xpogo LLC designs and builds the Pogopalooza courses. These courses consist of a series of boxes, ramps, steps, etc., which the jumpers utilize in their runs. The features of the course are most commonly topped with plywood and the frame made from two by fours. The final products are then painted. A new course is constructed for each Pogopalooza and then dismantled afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pogopalooza Facebook Course Album|url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.584611734923110.1073741827.326389647411988&amp;type=3|publisher=Facebook {{!}} Xpogo LLC|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more footnotes|date=June 2013}}
'''Redleg''' is a term used to refer to [[poor white]]s  that live on [[Barbados]], [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]], [[Grenada]] and a few other [[Caribbean]] islands. Their forebears came from [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and the [[West of England]].&lt;ref name="Sheppard"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Sheppard | first = Jill | title = The "Redlegs" of Barbados, their origins and history | publisher = KTO Press | date = 1977 | location = Millwood, N.Y. | page = 18 | isbn = 978-0-527-82230-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
According to [[folk etymology]], the name is derived from the effects of the [[Tropics|tropical]] sun on their fair-skinned legs (AKA sunburn). However, the term "Redlegs" and its variants were also in use for [[Irish Confederate Wars|Irish soldiers of the same sort]] as those later transported to [[Barbados]] by the English. The variant "[[Redshank (soldier)|Red-shankes]]" is recorded as early as the 16th century by [[Edmund Spenser#A View of the Present State of Ireland|Edmund Spenser]] in his dialogue on the current condition of Ireland.

In addition to "Redlegs", the term underwent extensive progression in Barbados and the following terms were also used: "Redshanks", "Poor whites", "Poor Backra", "Backra Johnny", "Ecky-Becky", "Poor Backward Johnnie", "Poor whites from below the hill", "Edey white mice" or "Beck-e Neck" (Baked-neck). Historically everything besides "poor whites" was used as derogatory insults.

== History ==
&lt;ref name="Sheppard"/&gt;
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
Many of the Redlegs' ancestors were [[Penal transportation|forcibly transported]] by [[Oliver Cromwell]] consequent to his [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Conquest of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Fraser | first = Henry | title = A-Z of Barbadian heritage | publisher = Heinemann Publishers (Caribbean) | date = 1990 | location = Kingston, Jamaica | pages = 90 | url = https://books.google.com/books?ei=xBNJTYX6GY7ksQPVg8GWCg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=e7HfAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=the+orders+of+Oliver+Cromwell#search_anchor | isbn = 978-976-605-098-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others had originally arrived on Barbados in the early to mid-17th century as [[indentured servant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=1847175961 |title=To Hell or Barbados: The ethnic cleansing of Ireland |first=Sean |last=O'Callaghan |year=2000 |publisher=Brandon |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=iGyNAwAAQBAJ |via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small groups of [[Holy Roman Empire|Germans]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] were also imported as plantation labourers.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

By the 18th century, indentured servants became less common. African [[slaves]] were trained in all necessary trades, so there was no demand for paid white labour.&lt;!-- Not "labor" as these are Commonwealth countries --&gt; The Redlegs,{{which|date=April 2014}} in turn, were unwilling to work alongside the [[Abolitionism|freed]] slave population on the [[plantations in the American South|plantation]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Therefore, most tried to emigrate to other British colonies whenever the opportunity arose, which reduced the white population to a small minority; and most of the white population that chose to stay eked out, at best, a subsistence living. The Redleg descendants of indentured servants today are extremely poor, almost all living in shacks in the countryside. Many Redlegs reside in St. John's Parish.{{which|date=December 2016}}

Because of the deplorable conditions under which the Redlegs lived, a campaign was initiated in the mid-19th century to move portions of the population to other islands which would be more economically hospitable. The relocation process succeeded, and a distinct community of Redleg descendants live in the ''Dorsetshire Hill'' district on [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]] as well as on the islands of [[Grenada]] around ''Mt. Moritz'' and [[Bequia]].

For the small Redleg community still living on Barbados, most live a poorer standard of life than the blacks, relying on farming or running small shops and brothels that serve the wealthier blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Magan |first=Manchán |authorlink=Manchán Magan |date=1 January 2009 |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/travel/2009/0117/1232059655355.html |title=Red Legs in Barbados| work=[[The Irish Times]] |quote=...most tend to be poorer than the black population. They farm smallholdings of sugar cane on the arid eastern coast of the island or live in Bridgetown, the capital, drinking in local grog shops or running white brothels for middle-class blacks."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sangra''' are a subtribe of [[Hindu]] [[Brahmin|Brahmins]] in the [[Jammu Division|Jaegion]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[India]]. They settled in the districts of Kathua and Jammu. It is widely believed that the Sangras of Kootah village migrated from Sanghar to a village near Purmandal.  

Sangras are also known as Shah Sangras, because of their history. The tales of their riches purport that all Kings of Jammu and Kashmir used to take [[loans]] from Sangra shahs of Kootah to finance state affairs. They owned agricultural lands spreading over several hundred square miles and were gold traders. Notably, in the 1970's, when former Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] was Finance Minister, he visited Kootah to see the financial management of Sangra shahs. 

== Distribution ==
Sangras in other parts of the country are also known as Hindu [[Jat people|jats]] in Punjab and Haryana and are settled in a village in the Thol district of Kurukshetra (Haryana), Hosiarpur (Punjab), India. Hindu Jats claimed that they received the surname ''Sangra'' from Raja Sangu as they are descendants of Raja Sangu.

The surname Sangra comes from the name of a place called Sangra in Ladakh, India, along river [[Suru River (Indus)|Suru]].

A Sangra village is found in the district [[Kargil district|Kargil]] of [[Ladakh]], India, along with [[Suru River (Indus)|Suru River]]. Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus there are all known as Sangras. A Sangar village is sited near the holy place, Purmandal in [[Jammu district]]. From this village Sangras are likely to have moved to various places in the search of fertile land and migrated to various regions nearby i.e. Punjab (Pakistan), Punjab (India), Haryana (India), J&amp;K (India), Sindh (Pakistan) and Tibet.

A [[Muslim Rajput]] tribe found in [[Punjab, Pakistan]] are also classed as Sangra.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;A Glossary of the tribes &amp; castes of Punjab by H. A Rose&lt;/ref&gt; This tribe claims to descend from Sangra, a [[Bhatti]] [[Rajput]] from [[Bikaner]], in what is now [[Rajasthan]]. In the 14th Century the tribe migrated from Rajasthan and settled in [[Kathala Chenab|Kathala]], the ruins of which are near Tibba Tanwi-Wala, near [[Bahwalpur]]. They are said to have converted to [[Islam]] in the 17th century. They use the surname Rai.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Sangras are found throughout the southern Punjab, with concentrations in [[Jhang District]], as well as in some other southern Punjab districts, such as [[Layyah]], [[Multan]], [[Okara, Pakistan|Okara]] and [[Sahiwal]].

Sangras can also be found in Indonesia.

== Demographics ==
Irrespective of religion, they are fond of lands and horse riding, and share physical characteristics: they are usually tall, broad-shouldered and have pointed noses.

The '''Semai''' (also known as '''Mai Semai''' or '''Orang Dalam'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ivor Hugh Norman Evans|title=The Negritos of Malaya|year=1968|publisher=Cass|isbn=0-7146-2006-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are a semi sedentary ethnic group living in the center of the [[Malay Peninsula]] in [[Southeast Asia]], known especially for their nonviolence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Csilla Dallos|title=From Equality to Inequality: Social Change Among Newly Sedentary Lanoh Hunter-Gatherer Traders of Peninsular Malaysia|year=2011|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=144-2661-71-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They speak [[Semai language|Semai]], an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language closely related to [[Temiar language|Temiar]], spoken by [[Temiar people|Temiars]] nearby. The Semai belong to the [[Senoi]] group and are one of the largest [[Orang Asli|indigenous]] ethnic group in the Peninsula and the largest of the Senoi group.

It is thought that the Semai are the remnants of the original, ancient and widespread population of Southeast Asia. According to [[Keene State College]]'s Orang Asli Archive, in 1991 there were 26,627&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.keene.edu:80/mason/orang-asli-archive/ |author= |title=Orang Asli Archive |publisher=Keene State College |date= |accessdate=2018-05-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009211922/http://sites.keene.edu:80/mason/orang-asli-archive/ |archivedate=2014-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the Center for Orang Asli Concern in 2000 there were 34,248&lt;ref name=health&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Center for Orang Asli Concerns|title=Orang Asli Population Statistic|url=http://www.coac.org.my/codenavia/portals/coacv2/code/main/main_art.php?parentID=11374494101180&amp;artID=11432750280711|accessdate=2017-07-11|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002212449/http://www.coac.org.my/codenavia/portals/coacv2/code/main/main_art.php?parentID=11374494101180&amp;artID=11432750280711|archivedate=2011-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semai living on the Malay Peninsula. This number has increased in recent years with the advent of better nutrition as well as improved sanitation and healthcare practices. These numbers, however, do not include other peoples of Semai or mixed descent, most of whom have assimilated into other cultures and have abandoned their ancestral tribal lands in order to seek better employment and education opportunities, especially in the larger cities.

A genetic study conducted in 1995 by a team of biologists from the [[National University of Singapore]] has shown a close relationship between the Semai and the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] of Cambodia. This is in line with the linguistic situation of the Semai, whose [[Semai language|language]] belongs to the [[Mon-Khmer languages|Mon-Khmer]] family. Furthermore, the Semai seem to be more closely related to the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] than to their Malay neighbours on the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;N. Saha, J. W. Mak, J. S. Tay, Y. Liu, J. A. Tan, P. S. Low, M. Singh, "Population genetic study among the Orange Asli (Semai Senoi) of Malaysia: Malayan aborigines", ''[[Human Biology]]'', National University of Singapore, February 1995, 67(1):37-57&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Orang Asli bei der Zubereitung einer Durian (2874318755).jpg|thumb|right|A Semai man in traditional attire opening a [[durian]] fruit in [[Cameron Highlands District]], [[Pahang]], [[Malaysia]].]]
The Semai are [[horticulturalist]]s who have a [[gift economy]].  They are among the indigenous peoples of Malaysia (see [[Orang Asli]]) who have been pushed into the hills and mountains by later, more technologically powerful incoming peoples. They have [[Acephalous society|no police and no government per se]]. According to Dentan, adults appear to be controlled primarily by public opinion. The Semai themselves say "There is no authority here but embarrassment." Although popular and verbally facile individuals are influential in public affairs, the Semai have no formal leaders.

Disputes in the Semai community are resolved by holding a ''becharaa'', or public assembly, at the headman's house.  This assembly may last for days and involves thorough discussion of the causes, motivations and resolution of the dispute by disputants and the whole community, ending with the headman charging either or both of the disputants not to repeat their behavior lest it endanger the community.  The Semai have a saying that "there are more reasons to fear a dispute than a tiger."&lt;ref&gt;De Waal, ''Our Inner Ape'', p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Semai children are never punished or forced against their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Rigby|title=New Perspectives on Bullying|year=2002|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=184-6423-23-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a parent asks a child to do something and the child says "I don't want to," the matter is ended. However, Semai parents use fear of strangers and violence in nature such as thunderstorms and lightning to control children's behavior if ever it becomes necessary. A concept similar to [[karma]] is also prevalent where children are told stories of [[sprite (creature)|sprites]] (mambang in Malay) and forest spirits who will take retribution if their sanctity is violated. Children also appear to be taught to fear their own aggressive impulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kirk Endicott|title=Malaysia's Original People: Past, Present and Future of the Orang Asli|year=2015|publisher=NUS Press|isbn=997-1698-61-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas P. Fry|title=War, Peace, and Human Nature: The Convergence of Evolutionary and Cultural Views|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019-0232-46-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of ''mengalah'' or giving in is most cherished where children since young are taught to 'give way' to others so as to preserve the peace and harmony of the village.

The games Semai children play are non-competitive.&lt;ref&gt;Bonta, "Cooperation and Competition in Peaceful Societies."&lt;/ref&gt; These games include forms of sports that encourage physical activity and exertions so that the body becomes tired and are therefore made ready for sleep and the subsequent [[dream]]ing. One game involves hitting at other children with sticks; the sticks, however, always stop short a few inches from their target so that no one actually gets struck. Modern games are also played but with significant modifications. A game of badminton for example uses no partition nets and keeps no score. The shuttlecock is deliberately hit so that it could be easily intercepted by the other player and passed back, and so forth. The objective seems to be purely for exercise.

With regards to space and dominion, there appears to be no distinction between the public and private realms, and thus, "the Western concept of privacy, domestic or otherwise, is not to be found".&lt;ref&gt;David D. Gilmore, ''Manhood in the Making: Cultural Concepts of Masculinity'' (Yale University Press, 1990: {{ISBN|0-300-04646-4}}), p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is also shared by the rural Malays, of whom, many are descended from mixed marriages with the Semais and other [[Orang Asli]] people. They carry with them the wisdom and lore of the Semais, including their non-violent and [[pacifist]] tendencies, harmonized with other prevailing religions of their adoption.

The Semais live in villages and most of the structures are built with wood, bamboo with weaved walls and thatched roofs using palm leaves. Semai houses have no visible bedrooms, especially for the children, as they all sleep in the main hall. The only separation seems to be in the form of wooden-beaded curtains for the parents' chambers. This form of separation is also adopted by the coastal Malays, who use instead curtains made of [[seashells]], and deutero-Malays, who use the [[batik]] cloth to form the curtains. There are no locks or otherwise, usual devices used to preventing an unwanted entry into any of these rooms. A simple way of telling that an entry is unwanted is by drawing down the curtains. To allow entry, the curtain is drawn to the sides and tied to form an opening. Expressed permission must be requested in cases where entry is needed when the curtains are closed. An entry without permission is a transgression and entails some sort of natural retribution.

The Semai people is also known for their traditional Sewang dance, where it is usually performed in events such as celebrating birth, funerals, circumcision ceremony, healing of sicknesses and for other [[superstition]]s; of which some of those events can last for three to six days.&lt;ref name="MKMSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinarharian.com.my/nasional/mengenali-kehidupan-masyarakat-semai-pantos-1.221212 |title=Mengenali kehidupan masyarakat Semai Pantos |author= |publisher=Sinar Harian |date=15 November 2013 |accessdate=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spirituality and beliefs ==
[[File:Semai - remaja.jpg|right|thumb|Semai teenagers in [[Tapah]], [[Perak]], [[Malaysia]].]]
The animist traditions of the Semai include a thunder [[deity]] called ''Enku''. A small eyeless [[snake]] is called Thunder's headband. One of the most important beings associated with thunder are the [[Nāga]],&lt;ref name="TCBLASP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8506090/The_comparison_between_Lanoh_and_Semai_people |title=The comparison between Lanoh and Semai people |author=Shazwan Aqif |publisher=Academia |year= |accessdate=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group of huge, subterranean dragons that ravage villages during thunder-squalls and are associated with rainbows. ''Chuntah'' is a ritual performed to make the evil spirits leave.&lt;ref name="TCBLASP"/&gt; Chuntah is performed in the middle of a storm where a man collects rain in a [[bamboo]] container until it is nearly full, then gashes his skin and lets the blood run into the container.

The Semai world of animals includes ''cheb'' that has feathers and flies, ''ka''' has  rounded scales or moist skin and lives in or near the water, ''menhar'' lives on the ground or in the trees, menhar also includes [[fungi]]. The Semai usually have restrictions on eating animals that straddle two groups. [[Snakes]] are usually not eaten because moving menhar have legs, but snakes live on land, so the Semai consider this "unnatural."

'''''Spin''''' is a 1995 [[documentary film]] by [[Brian Springer]] composed of raw satellite feeds featuring politicians' pre-appearance planning. It covers, not only the [[United States presidential election, 1992|presidential election]], but also the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] as well as the [[Operation Save America|Operation Rescue]] abortion protests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/282222/Spin/overview The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the 1992 presidential election as his springboard, Springer captures the behind-the-scenes schemings of politicians and newscasters in the early 1990s. [[Pat Robertson]] banters about "homos," [[Al Gore]] learns how to avoid abortion questions, [[George H. W. Bush]] talks to [[Larry King]] about [[Halcion]]—all presuming they are off camera. Composed of 100% unauthorized satellite footage, ''Spin'' is a surreal expose of media-constructed reality.&lt;ref name="art"&gt;{{cite web |title= Spin |publisher= [[Stay Free!]] |url= http://illegal-art.org/video/popups/spin.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20021204011148/http://www.illegal-art.org/video/popups/spin.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2002-12-04 |accessdate= 2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film also documents behind the scenes footage of [[Larry Agran]] who unsuccessfully sought the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination for President. Agran was generally ignored by the media during his candidacy, a topic covered in the documentary. The media did not report his polling numbers even as he met or exceeded the support of other candidates such as [[Jerry Brown]]. Party officials excluded him from most debates on various grounds, even having him arrested when he interrupted to ask to participate. When he managed to join the other candidates in any forum, his ideas went unreported. 

[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said of the film, "a devastating critique of television's profound manipulativeness in the way it packages the news and politics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/06/arts/critic-s-choice-video-festival-of-an-art-for-life-s-dirtier-nooks.html CRITIC'S CHOICE/VIDEO; Festival of an Art for Life's Dirtier Nooks]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Spin'' is a follow-up of the 1992 film ''Feed''; for which Springer provided much of the raw satellite footage.

It is mainly written, and rather less often spoken.

Swiss Standard German is not a [[German dialects|German dialect]], but a variety of standard German. It is not to be confused with [[Swiss German]], an umbrella term for the various [[Alemannic German]] [[dialect]]s (in the sense of "traditional regional varieties") that are the default everyday languages for the majority of the population in German-speaking Switzerland.

German is a [[pluricentric language]]. In contrast with other local [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of German, Swiss Standard German has distinctive features in all linguistic domains: not only in [[phonology]], but also in [[vocabulary]], [[syntax]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[orthography]]. These characteristics of Swiss Standard German are called ''[[Helvetism]]s''. Besides influences from Alemannic German, those characteristics include extensive use of [[loan words]] from [[Romance languages]], especially French.

==Written Swiss Standard German==
Swiss Standard German (SSG) is the official [[written language]] in German-speaking Switzerland. It is used in books, all official publications (including all laws and regulations), in newspapers, printed notices, most advertising and in other printed matter. Authors write literature mainly using Swiss Standard German; some dialect literature exists. SSG is similar in most respects to the Standard German in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]; there are a few differences in spelling, most notably the replacing of the German ligature ''[[ß]]'' with ''ss''. For example:

* ''Strasse'' = ''Straße'' (Germany) = street

There are some differences in vocabulary, including, for instance, using a [[loanword]] from another language. For example:

* ''Billett'' (from French) = ''[[:de:Fahrkarte|Fahrkarte]]'' (Germany) = ticket (for bus/tram/train etc.)
* ''{{Lang|de-CH|Führerausweis}}'' or ''Billet'' (colloquial) = ''[[:de:Führerschein und Fahrerlaubnis|Führerschein]]'' (Germany) = driving licence
* ''Velo'' (from French) = ''[[:de:Fahrrad|Fahrrad]]'' (Germany) = bicycle
* ''[[Natel]]'' or ''Handy'' = ''Handy''/''Mobiltelefon'' (Germany) = mobile phone
* ''parkieren'' = ''parken'' (Germany) = to park
* ''Poulet'' (from French) = ''Hähnchen'' (Germany) = chicken

In addition, SSG uses different orthography in letter writing, and the salutations used for the same also differ from Standard German.

The Swiss use the Swiss Standard German word ''Lernfahrausweis'' for a learner's driving permit (note how it differs from the SSG word for a "regular" driving license: ''Führerausweis'').

The Swiss use the Standard German word ''Spital'' (hospital). ''Spital'' is also found in volumes of Standard German language dictionaries; however, Germans from northern Germany prefer to use ''Krankenhaus'', whereas ''Spital'' is also used in areas of southern Germany, Austria, and Liechtenstein.

There are differences in gender for some nouns:

*de-ch: '''''das''' Tram'' (neuter); de: '''''die''' Tram'' (feminine) (''Straßenbahn'' is used more frequently in Germany); en: tram
*de-ch: '''''das''' E-Mail'' (neuter); de: '''''die''' E-Mail'' (feminine); en: e-mail

Some expressions are borrowed from French and thus differ from usage in Germany, such as

*de-ch: ''ich habe kalt'' (literally "I have cold"), de: ''mir ist [es] kalt'' (literally "[it] is cold to me")
*de-ch: ''das geht dir gut'', de: ''das passt dir gut'' (it suits you)

The [[Keyboard layout#Switzerland|Swiss keyboard layout]] has no {{key press|ß}} key, nor does it have the capital [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] keys ''Ä'', ''Ö'' and ''Ü''. This dates back to mechanical [[typewriter]]s that had the French [[diacritic|diacritical marks]] letters on these keys to allow the Swiss to write French on a Swiss German [[QWERTZ]] keyboard (and vice versa). Thus a Swiss German [[Swissmem|VSM]] keyboard has an {{key press|ä}} key that prints an ''à'' (a-grave) when shifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snv.ch/ |title=Swiss standard: former VSM standard SN 07402 |publisher=Schweizerische Normen-Vereinigung (SNV) |date= |location=Winterhur. Switzerland |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible to write uppercase umlauts by use of [[caps lock]] or by using the {{key press|¨}} [[dead key]].

The names of municipalities, towns, stations, and streets are often not written with a starting capital umlaut, but instead with ''Ae'', ''Oe'' and ''Ue'', such as the Zürich suburb [[Oerlikon (Zürich)|Oerlikon]], or the hamlet [[Aetzikofen]], or the Bernese municipality [[Uebeschi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cadastre.ch/content/cadastre-internet/de/manual-av/publication/recommendation.detail.document.html/cadastre-internet/de/documents/av-empfehlungen/Empfehlung-Schreibweise-Gemeinde-Ortschaftsnamen-de.pdf.html |title=Empfehlungen zur Schreibweise der Gemeinde- und Ortschaftsnamen, Richtlinien zur Schreibweise der Stationsnamen |publisher=Bundesamt für Landestopografie, Bundesamt für Verkehr, Bundesamt für Statistik |language=German| format=PDF |type=Federal Recommendation |page=20 |edition=Version 1.0 |date=20 January 2010 |quote=In der Schweiz sind auf historischen Karten grosse Umlaute mit Ae, Oe und Ue bereits vor der Einführung der Schreibmaschine um ca. 1880 zu finden.

As for the various dialects of Swiss German, they are occasionally written, but their written usage is mostly restricted to informal situations such as private [[texting|text messages]], [[e-mail]]s, [[Letter (message)|letters]], notes, or within social media such as [[Facebook]]. The ability of German Swiss to transliterate their language into writing is an integral and important part of the identity and culture of German-speaking Switzerland.{{sfnb|von Matt|2012}}

==Spoken Swiss Standard German==
The default [[spoken language]] in German-speaking Switzerland is mostly the respective local dialect. Due to a rather large inter-cantonal migration rate (about 5% p.a.) within modern Switzerland for decades, many different Swiss German dialects are spoken in any one place, especially in urban areas; for example, in the city of Zurich (end of 2013): of the 272,700 Swiss (total: 400,000) living in Zurich, only 40% (28%) are from Zurich itself with 51% (36%) from the entire canton of Zurich.&lt;ref name=ZH4Q2013&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/prd/de/index/statistik/publikationsdatenbank/Periodika/Bevoelkerung_Stadt_Zuerich/BEV_4Q_2013.html| title=Bevölkerung Stadt Zürich| edition=Ausgabe 4/2013| publisher=Statistik, Stadt Zürich| language=German| format=PDF| type=Publication| page=5| location=Zürich| date=17 April 2014| accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of any educational setting, Swiss Standard German is spoken in very few specific formal situations, such as in news broadcasts and reputable programmes of the public media channels; in the parliaments of German-speaking [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]]s; in the federal parliament in Berne (unless another official language of Switzerland is used), although dialect is certainly encroaching on this domain; in loudspeaker announcements in public places such as railway stations, etc. Church services, including the sermon and prayers, are usually in Swiss Standard German. Generally in any educational setting Swiss Standard German is used (during lessons, lectures or tutorials). However, outside of lessons Swiss-German dialects are used, even when, for example, talking to a teacher about the class. The situations in which Swiss Standard German is spoken are characteristically formal and public, and there are situations where written communication is also important.

In informal situations, Swiss Standard German is used whenever a German Swiss is communicating with a non-German Swiss and it is assumed that this person does not understand the respective dialect. It is also often used when only one person can speak Swiss German while the other person can understand dialect but cannot speak dialect. Among each other, the German-speaking Swiss mostly use their respective Swiss German dialect, irrespective of social class, education or topic.

Unlike in other regions where [[Standard German|German]] varieties are spoken, there is no continuum between Swiss Standard German and the Swiss German dialects. The speakers speak either Swiss Standard German, or a Swiss German dialect, and they are conscious about this choice.{{sfnb|von Matt|2012}}

Nevertheless, about 11%, or 871,800, of Swiss residents speak ''High German'' (also called Standard German) at home, but mainly due to the presence of German immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/bevoelkerung/sprachen-religionen/sprachen.assetdetail.4842942.html|title=Die am häufigsten üblicherweise zu Hause gesprochenen Sprachen der ständigen Wohnbevölkerung ab 15 Jahren|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=Swiss Federal Statistical Office|location=Neuchâtel, Switzerland|language=German, French, Italian|type=official site|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|accessdate=2018-11-18|quote=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, about 46% of foreign nationals living in German-speaking Switzerland do not use Swiss German at all, but instead (Swiss) Standard German or other languages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/statistiken/kataloge-datenbanken/publikationen.assetdetail.3543997.html|title=Schweizerdeutsch und Hochdeutsch in der Schweiz - Analyse von Daten aus der Erhebung zur Sprache, Religion und Kultur 2014 {{!}} Publikation|last=Statistik|first=Bundesamt für|work=Bundesamt für Statistik|access-date=2018-12-01|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diglossia==
The concurrent usage of Swiss Standard German and Swiss German dialects has been called a typical case of [[diglossia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Ferguson, C. A. |date=1972 |orig-year=orig. 1959-60 |chapter=Diglossia |editor=Giglioli, P. P. |title=Language and Social Context |location=Harmondsworth |publisher=Penguin |pages=232–251}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim has been debated because the typical diglossia situation assumes that the standard variety has high prestige, whereas the informal variety has low prestige.&lt;ref name=Barbour&gt;{{Citation |author1=Barbour, S. |author2=Stevenson, P. |date=1990 |title=Variation in German |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the German-speaking part of Switzerland, however, the Swiss German dialects do not have a low prestige and permeate every socio-economic class of society. Although, dialect is more often used in rural than urban areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since Swiss Standard German is the usual written language and the Swiss German dialects are the usual spoken language, their interrelation has been called a ''medial diglossia''.&lt;ref name=Barbour/&gt;

==Attitude to spoken Swiss Standard German==
Most German Swiss can speak fluent Swiss Standard German, but may or may not like doing so, as it feels stilted and unnatural to many. When they compare their Swiss Standard German to the way people from Germany speak, they think their own proficiency is inferior because it is studied and slower. Most German Swiss think that the majority speak rather poor Swiss Standard German; however, when asked about their personal proficiency, a majority will answer that they speak quite well.{{sfnb|Heule|2006}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28859">{{about|Canadian Football League competition|the series of National Football League games|NFL on Thanksgiving Day}}

The '''Thanksgiving Day Classic''' is an annual [[doubleheader (television)|doubleheader]] held on [[Thanksgiving (Canada)|Thanksgiving]] in the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). It is typically one of two days in which the league plays on a Monday afternoon; the other is the [[Labour Day Classic]]. Unlike the Labour Day Classic, the teams in the Thanksgiving Day Classic rotate each year. The games also lack a presenting sponsor as the Labour Day Classic games have.

The [[Montreal Alouettes]] have traditionally been given hosting duties for the opening game. This was originally started in 1997 to compensate for not being part of the Labour Day Classic festivities; Montreal and the various Ottawa franchises normally play on Labour Day when both franchises are active. The Alouettes' permanent hosting of Thanksgiving remained in place after [[Ottawa Redblacks|Ottawa returned to the league]] in 2014.  The [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] played CFL games annually in all but three years between 1958 and 1982, hosting the vast majority of them; Hamilton also hosted three times in four years from 1990 to 1993 and again hosted a Thanksgiving matchup in 2013 due to stadium construction disrupting their hosting of the 2013 Labour Day Classic.

Since the CFL's creation in [[1958 CFL season|1958]] to the [[2018 CFL season|most recently completed season]], there have been 120 games played on Thanksgiving Day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://d3ham790trbkqy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-CFL-Gm-Notes-73-Cgy-at-Mtl.pdf 2018 CFL Game Notes, Calgary at Montreal]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite Canadian Thanksgiving being a legal holiday in the United States ([[Columbus Day]]), none of the [[Canadian Football League in the United States|CFL's American teams]] ever played the Thanksgiving Day Classic. The games have also not been televised live in the United States since 2009, although one of the two was broadcast on tape-delay in 2013.

==Possible discontinuation or reformatting==
In late 2017, a proposal emerged to move the start of the CFL season to five or six weeks earlier than it begins in the present day, so that the [[Grey Cup]] would be held on the third weekend of October, as opposed to the fourth Sunday in November as it stands as of 2018. The change, designed to accommodate a potential U.S. television agreement with [[NFL Network]], has support among CFL owners and would, if approved, take effect for the [[2019 CFL season]]. If the proposal were to take effect, Thanksgiving Day weekend would overlap with the CFL's conference championship games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawasun.com/sports/football/cfl/grey-cup-in-october-tv-deal-with-nfl-cfl-commish-speaks|first=Tim|last=Baines|title=Grey Cup in October?

"'''The Lorelei Signal'''" is the fourth episode of the [[Star Trek: The Animated Series (season 1)|first season]] of the animated American [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series|Star Trek]]''. It first aired in the [[NBC]] Saturday morning lineup on September&amp;nbsp;29, 1973, and was written by [[Margaret Armen]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This story was expanded into a novelette by science-fiction author [[Alan Dean Foster]] as part of the collection, ''[http://www.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Star_Trek_Log_2 Star Trek Log Two]'' (1974) ({{ISBN|0-345-25812-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; author of three ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Original Series]]'' episodes.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Armen wrote the ''Original Series'' episodes "[[The Gamesters of Triskelion]]", "[[The Paradise Syndrome]]" and "[[The Cloud Minders]]" (teleplay only).&lt;/ref&gt;

Set in the 23rd century, the series follows the adventures of Captain [[James T. Kirk]] (voiced by [[William Shatner]]) and the crew of the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] starship ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]''. In this episode, [[Nyota Uhura|Lt. Uhura]] (voiced by [[Nichelle Nichols]]), [[Christine Chapel|Nurse Chapel]] (voiced by [[Majel Barrett]]) and the ''Enterprise'' women must take charge of the ship from incapacitated male senior officers and rescue Captain Kirk and his landing party held on an alien world.

==Plot==
On [[stardate]] 5483.7, the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] starship ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' investigates a sector of space where [[starship]]s have been disappearing every 27.346 years. A strangely compelling musical signal lures the ''Enterprise'' to a remote planet in the Taurean system some 20 light-years distance. The music works on the men of the ''Enterprise'', affecting their judgement and causing them to experience euphoric hallucinations. [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] (voiced by [[William Shatner]]), First Officer [[Spock]] (voiced by [[Leonard Nimoy]]), Chief Medical Officer [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]] (voiced by [[DeForest Kelley]]), and Lieutenant Carver (voiced by [[James Doohan]]) [[transporter (Star Trek)|beam down]] to the source of the signals.

Arriving on the planet surface they discover the inhabitants are a race of beautiful women who want to celebrate their arrival. They are given drink which they discover is drugged as they begin to fall unconscious. When they awake, they find themselves in a weakened state brought about by rapid aging. They discover headbands locked around their foreheads which somehow transmit their life-force to the bodies of the women, who are growing in strength.

On board the ''Enterprise'', Communications Officer [[Nyota Uhura|Lt. Uhura]] (voiced by [[Nichelle Nichols]]) talks with [[Christine Chapel|Nurse Chapel]] (voiced by [[Majel Barrett]]) about the men's condition and comes to the conclusion that she must take command due to the irrational behavior of [[Montgomery Scott|Chief Engineer Scott]] (voiced by James Doohan) and the other men.

Back on the planet, Kirk and his party manage to gather enough strength to escape to a spacious garden and hide inside a tall urn. They discover that the pace of their loss of strength correlates with the proximity of the women. Rather than just wait to be found or just die, they decide that Spock should go back alone and attempt to find a communicator and contact the ship since he has not deteriorated as much as the others. Spock is able to complete his task and orders Uhura to come down with an all-female rescue party.

Uhura beams down with Chapel and a female security force and quickly stun the now-aggressive women with their [[phaser (Star Trek)|phasers]] then compel them to help rescue the men after being told the story of how the Taurean women came to be in their current situation.

Back on the ''Enterprise'', the aging process is stopped with the removal of the headbands, but they cannot find a treatment that will restore their original age until Spock comes up with the idea of using their original transporter patterns from when they first beamed down.

Uhura returns to the planet, and witnesses the Taurean leader, Theela (voiced by Majel Barrett), destroying the device that had been luring starships, stating that Uhura should tell Kirk she kept her side of the bargain.  Uhura informs them that a ship of women will return to bring them to a habitable world and that the women's bodies should return to normal in a few months.

==Casting==
In addition to her normal role as [[Christine Chapel|Nurse Chapel]], [[Majel Barrett]] supplies the voice of Theela, the head of the Taurean women, [[Nichelle Nichols]] supplies the voice of security officer Lt. Davison in addition to that of [[Nyota Uhura|Lt. Uhura]] and [[James Doohan]] adds the voice of Lt. Carver to his usual role of [[Montgomery Scott|Chief Engineer Scott]]. (Doohan also sings part of an old Scottish folk song as the ''Enterprise'' is seen drifting by the planet, in a segment that lasts over half a minute.)

This is one of three times a woman commands the ''Enterprise'', the other two being in [[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|"The Cage"]] by [[Number One (Star Trek)|Number One]], and "[[Turnabout Intruder]]" by one of Kirk's former lovers.

The origin and the meaning of the name ''Tuareg'' have long been debated, with various etymologies hypothesized. It would appear that ''Twārəg'' is derived from the [[broken plural]] of ''Tārgi'', a name whose former meaning was "inhabitant of ''Targa''", the Tuareg name of the [[Libya]]n region commonly known as [[Fezzan]]. ''Targa'' in Berber means "(drainage) channel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghoubeid|first1=Alojaly|title=Dictionnaire touareg-français|date=2003|publisher=Museum Tusculanum|isbn=87-7289-844-5|page=656|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory is that Tuareg is derived from ''Tuwariq'', the plural of the Arabic exonym ''Tariqi''.&lt;ref name="Shoup"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shoup III|first1=John A.|title=Ethnic Groups of Africa and the Middle East|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=159884363X|page=295|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=GN5yv3-U6goC&amp;pg=PA295#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term for a Tuareg man is ''Amajagh'' (variants: ''Amashegh'', ''Amahagh''), the term for a woman ''Tamajaq'' (variants: ''Tamasheq'', ''Tamahaq'', ''Timajaghen''). Spellings of the appellation vary by Tuareg dialect. However, they all reflect the same linguistic root, expressing the notion of "freemen". As such, the endonym strictly refers only to the Tuareg [[nobility]], not the artisanal client castes and the slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Hourst, pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt; Two other Tuareg self-designations are ''Kel Tamasheq'' ([[Neo-Tifinagh]]: {{lang|tmh-Tfng|Kel Tamasheq|italic=yes}}), meaning "speakers of [[Tuareg language|Tamasheq]]", and ''Kel Tagelmust'', meaning "veiled people" in allusion to the [[tagelmust]] garment that is traditionally worn by Tuareg men.&lt;ref name="Shoup"/&gt; The [[English language|English]] exonym "Blue People" is similarly derived from the [[indigo]] color of the tagelmust veils and other clothing, which sometimes stains the skin underneath.&lt;ref name="GearonEamonn"&gt;Gearon, Eamonn, (2011) ''The Sahara: A Cultural History'' Oxford University Press, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Another term for the Tuareg is ''Imuhagh'' or ''Imushagh'', a cognate to the northern Berber self-name ''Imazighen''.&lt;ref name="Minahan418"&gt;{{cite book|author=James B. Minahan|title=Encyclopedia of Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups around the World|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pGClDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA418|year=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-954-9|page=418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demography and languages==
[[File:Tuareg area.png|thumb|200px|The traditional distribution of the Tuareg in the [[Sahara]]&lt;ref name="Shoup"/&gt;]]
The Tuareg today inhabit a vast area in the [[Sahara]], stretching from far southwestern Libya to southern Algeria, Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso.&lt;ref name="Shoup"/&gt; Their combined population in these territories exceeds 2.5 million, with an estimated population in Niger of around 2 million (11% of inhabitants) and in Mali of another 0.5 million (3% of inhabitants.&lt;ref name=nigertuareg/&gt;&lt;ref name="Imperato2008xxlvii"/&gt; The Tuareg are also the majority ethnic group in the [[Kidal Region]] of northeastern Mali.&lt;ref name="rudolph381"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph R. Rudolph Jr.|title=Encyclopedia of Modern Ethnic Conflicts, 2nd Edition &amp;#91;2 volumes&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OjkVCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA381|year=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-553-4|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tuareg traditionally speak the [[Tuareg languages]], also known as ''Tamasheq'', ''Tamachen'', ''Tamashekin'', ''Tomacheck'' and ''Kidal''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/taq Tamasheq: A language of Mali], Ethnologue&lt;/ref&gt; These tongues belong to the [[Berber languages|Berber]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic family]].&lt;ref name="SIL"/&gt; According to ''[[Ethnologue]]'', there are an estimated 1.2 million Tuareg speakers. Around half this number consists of speakers of the Eastern dialect (''Tamajaq'', ''Tawallammat'').&lt;ref name="SIL"/&gt; The exact number of Tuareg speakers per territory is uncertain. The CIA estimates that the Tuareg population in Mali constitutes approximately 0.9% of the national population (~150,000), whereas about 3.5% of local inhabitants speak Tuareg (Tamacheq) as a primary language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ml.html Mali], CIA Factbook, Accessed on November 7, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Imperato (2008) estimates that the Tuareg represent around 3% of Mali's population.&lt;ref name="Imperato2008xxlvii"/&gt;

[[File:2 - La reine Tin Hinan, 125x150cm, huile sur toile.jpg|thumb|Artist's representation of [[Tin Hinan]], an ancient queen of the [[Hoggar Mountains|Hoggar]]|left]]
In antiquity, the Tuareg moved southward from the [[Tafilalt]] region into the [[Sahel]] under the Tuareg founding queen [[Tin Hinan]], who is believed to have lived between the 4th and 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Brett, Michael; Elizabeth Fentress [https://books.google.com/books?id=vdrAfKmUrLcC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22tin+hinan%22#PPA208,M1 ''The Berbers''] Wiley Blackwell 1997 {{ISBN|978-0631207672}} p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; The matriarch's 1,500 year old monumental [[Tin Hinan tomb]] is located in the Sahara at [[Abalessa]] in the [[Hoggar Mountains]] of southern Algeria. Vestiges of an inscription in [[Tifinagh]], the Tuareg's traditional Libyco-Berber writing script, have been found on one of the ancient sepulchre's walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=L.

External accounts of interaction with the Tuareg are available from at least the 10th century. Ibn Hawkal (10th century), El-Bekri (11th century), Edrisi (12th century), Ibn Batutah (14th century), and Leo Africanus (16th century), all documented the Tuareg in some form, usually as Mulatthamin or “the veiled ones.” Of the early historians, fourteenth century Arab scholar, Ibn Khaldûn probably has some of the most detailed commentary on the life and people of the Sahara, though he apparently never actually met them.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaisen, Johannes and Ida Nicolaisen.

At the turn of the 19th century, the Tuareg territory was organised into confederations, each ruled by a supreme Chief (''Amenokal''), along with a counsel of elders from each tribe. These confederations are sometimes called "''Drum Groups''" after the Amenokal's symbol of authority, a drum. Clan (''Tewsit'') elders, called Imegharan (wisemen), are chosen to assist the chief of the confederation. Historically, there have been seven major confederations:{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In the late 19th century, the Tuareg resisted the [[Second French colonial empire|French colonial invasion]] of their Central Saharan homelands and annihilated a French expedition led by [[Paul Flatters]] in 1881. However, in the long run Tuareg broadswords were no match for the more advanced weapons of French troops. After numerous massacres on both sides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africamission-mafr.org/foucauld2.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051023073845/http://www.africamission-mafr.org/foucauld2.htm |archive-date=23 October 2005 |title=Charles de Foucauld - Sera béatifié à l'automne 2005 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Tuareg were subdued and required to sign treaties in [[Mali]] 1905 and [[Niger]] 1917. In southern Morocco and [[Algeria]], the French met some of the strongest resistance from the [[Ahaggar]] Tuareg. Their ''[[Amenokal]]'', traditional chief [[Moussa ag Amastan]], fought numerous battles in defence of the region. Finally, Tuareg territories were taken under French governance, and their confederations were largely dismantled and reorganised.

===Post-colonial era===
{{see also|Tuareg rebellion (2012)}}
When African countries achieved widespread independence in the 1960s, the traditional Tuareg territory was divided among a number of modern states: [[Niger]], [[Mali]], [[Algeria]], [[Libya]], and [[Burkina Faso]]. Competition for resources in the [[Sahel]] has since led to conflicts between the Tuareg and neighboring African groups, especially after political disruption following French colonization and independence. There have been tight restrictions placed on [[nomad]]ization because of high [[population growth]]. [[Desertification]] is exacerbated by human activity i.e.; exploitation of resources and the increased firewood needs of growing cities. Some Tuareg are therefore experimenting with farming; some have been forced to abandon herding and seek jobs in towns and cities.&lt;ref name=peace&gt;"Does Supply-Induced Scarcity Drive Violent Conflicts in the African Sahel? The Case of the Tuareg Rebellion in Northern Mali" (Nov., 2008) ''Journal of Peace Research'' Vol. 45, No. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mali]], a [[Tuareg Rebellion (1962–1964)|Tuareg uprising]] resurfaced in the [[Adrar N'Fughas]] mountains in the 1960s, following Mali's independence. Several Tuareg joined, including some from the [[Adrar des Iforas]] in northeastern Mali. The 1960s' rebellion was a fight between a group of Tuareg and the newly independent state of Mali. The Malian Army suppressed the revolt. Resentment among the Tuareg fueled the second uprising.&lt;ref name=peace/&gt;
[[File:Le Mali entame le dialogue avec les Touaregs (6972875286).jpg|thumb|Tuareg [[National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad|separatist rebels]] in Mali, January 2012]]
This [[Tuareg Rebellion (1990–1995)|second (or third) uprising]] was in May 1990. At this time, in the aftermath of a clash between government soldiers and Tuareg outside a prison in [[Tchin-Tabaraden]], Niger, Tuareg in both Mali and Niger claimed autonomy for their traditional homeland: ([[Ténéré]], capital [[Agadez]], in Niger and the [[Azawad]] and [[Kidal]] regions of Mali). Deadly clashes between Tuareg fighters (with leaders such as [[Mano Dayak]]) and the military of both countries followed, with deaths numbering well into the thousands. Negotiations initiated by France and [[Algeria]] led to peace agreements (January 11, 1992 in Mali and 1995 in Niger). Both agreements called for decentralization of national power and guaranteed the integration of Tuareg resistance fighters into the countries' respective national armies.&lt;ref&gt;"A Political Analysis of Decentralisation: Coopting the Tuareg Threat in Mali" (Sep. 2001) ''The Journal of Modern African Studies'' Vol. 39, No. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Major fighting between the Tuareg resistance and government security forces ended after the 1995 and 1996 agreements. As of 2004, sporadic fighting continued in Niger between government forces and Tuareg groups struggling for independence. In 2007, a new [[Tuareg Rebellion (2007–2009)|surge in violence]] occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Denise Youngblood Coleman (June 2013) "Niger, Political Conditions" CountryWatch {{cite web |url=http://www.countrywatch.com/country_profile.aspx?vcountry=127 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221185636/http://www.countrywatch.com/country_profile.aspx?vcountry=127 |archivedate=21 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tuareg traditionally adhered to the [[Berber mythology]]. Archaeological excavations of prehistoric tombs in the Maghreb have yielded skeletal remains that were painted with [[ochre]]. Although this ritual practice was known to the [[Iberomaurusian]]s, the custom seems instead to have been primarily derived from the ensuing [[Capsian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ouachi|first1=Moustapha|title=The Berbers and the death|publisher=El-Haraka|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Megalithic tombs, such as the [[Jedars|jedar]] sepulchres, were also erected for religious and funerary purposes. In 1926, one such tomb was discovered south of [[Casablanca]]. The monument was engraved with funerary inscriptions in the ancient Libyco-Berber writing script known as Tifinagh, which the Tuareg still use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ouachi|first1=Moustapha|title=The Berbers and rocks|publisher=El-Haraka|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have also retained elements of pre-Islamic cosmology and rituals, particularly Tuareg women. For example, Tuareg religious ceremonies contain allusions to matrilineal spirits, as well as to fertility, menstruation, the earth and ancestresses.&lt;ref name="Levinson1996tua" /&gt; Norris (1976) suggests that this apparent syncretism may stem from the influence of [[Sufism|Sufi]] Muslim preachers on the Tuareg.&lt;ref name="Norris1976" /&gt;

==Society==
The Tuareg society has traditionally featured clan membership, social status and caste hierarchies within each political confederation.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p499"/&gt;

===Clans===
[[File:Tuareg.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|A Tuareg from [[Algeria]]]]
Clans have been a historic part of the Tuaregs. The 7th century invasion of North Africa from the Middle East triggered an extensive migration of Tuaregs such as the Lemta and the Zarawa, along with other fellow [[pastoralism|pastoral]] Berbers.&lt;ref name="Levinson1996tua"/&gt; Further invasions of [[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]] Arab tribes into Tuareg regions in the 11th century moved the Tuareg southward into seven clans, which the [[oral tradition]] of Tuaregs claims to be descendants of the same mother.&lt;ref name="Levinson1996tua"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolaisen1963"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Nicolaisen|title=Ecology and Culture of the Pastoral Tuareg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLUbAAAAIAAJ| year=1963|publisher=New York: Thames and Hudson; Copenhagen: Rhodos|pages=411–412|oclc= 67475747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Tuareg clan (''tawshet'') is made up of family groups constituting a tribe,{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=16, 17-22, 38-44}} each led by its chief, the ''amghar''. A series of ''tawsheten'' (plural of ''tawshet'') may bond together under an ''[[Amenokal]]'', forming a ''Kel'' clan confederation. Tuareg self-identification is related only to their specific ''Kel'', which means "those of". For example, ''Kel Dinnig'' (those of the east), ''Kel Ataram'' (those of the west). The position of ''amghar'' is hereditary through a matrilineal principle, it is usual for the son of a sister of the incumbent chieftain to succeed to his position. The ''amenokal'' is elected in a ritual which differs between groups, the individual amghar who lead the clans making up the confederation usually have the deciding voice.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=20-21}} The matrilineal inheritance and mythology among Tuareg clans, states Susan Rasmussen, a cultural vestige from the pre-Islamic era of the Tuareg society.&lt;ref name="Levinson1996tua"/&gt;

According to Rasmussen, Tuareg society exhibits a blend of pre-Islamic and Islamic practices.&lt;ref name="Levinson1996tua"/&gt; As such, patrilineal Muslim values are believed to have been superimposed upon the Tuareg's traditional matrilineal society. Other, apparently newer customs include the practice of close-cousin endogamous marriages and polygyny in conformity with Islamic tenets. Polygyny, which has been witnessed among Tuareg chiefs and Islamic scholars, is in turn thought to be contrary to the pre-Islamic monogamous tradition of the nomadic Tuareg.&lt;ref name="Levinson1996tua"/&gt;

===Social stratification===
Tuareg society has featured caste hierarchies within each clan and political confederation.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p499"/&gt;{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=16, 17-22, 38-44}}&lt;ref name="Tamari 1991 221–222, 228–250"/&gt; These hierarchical systems have included nobles, clerics, craftsmen and unfree strata of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Rudolph Jr.|title=Encyclopedia of Modern Ethnic Conflicts, 2nd Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OjkVCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA380 |year=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-553-4|pages=380–381}}, Quote: "The Tuareg are seminomadic people of Berber origin. There are various Tuareg clans and confederation of clans.

====Nobility, vassals and clerics====
[[File:Tuareg2.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|Tuareg man from Algeria]]
Traditionally, Tuareg society is hierarchical, with [[nobility]] and vassals. The linguist [[Karl-Gottfried Prasse]] (1995) indicates that the nobles constitute the highest caste.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=16-17}} They are known in the Tuareg language as ''imúšaɣ'' (''Imajaghan'', "the proud and free" in Arabic&lt;ref name="Gates2010p499"/&gt;). The nobles originally had a monopoly on carrying arms and owning camels, and were the warriors of the Tuareg regions.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=16}} They may have achieved their social status by subjugating other Tuareg castes, keeping arms to defend their properties and vassals. They have also collected tribute from their vassals. This warrior nobility has traditionally married within their caste, not to individuals in strata below their own.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=16}} A collection of tribes, each led by a noble, forms a confederation called ''amanokal'', whose chieftain is elected from among the nobles by the tribal chiefs.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=16-17}}&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt; The chieftain is the overlord during times of war, and receives tribute and taxes from tribes as a sign of their submission to his authority.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=20}}

The vassal-herdsmen are the second free strata within Tuareg society, occupying a position just below that of the nobles.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=17}} They are known as ''ímɣad'' (''Imghad'', singular ''Amghid'') in the Tuareg language.&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt; Although the vassals were also free, they did not own camels but instead kept donkeys and herds of goats, sheep and oxen. They pastured and tended their own herds as well those owned by the nobles of the confederation.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=17}} The vassal strata have traditionally paid an annual ''tiwse'', or tribute to the nobles as a part of their status obligations, and also hosted any noble who was traveling through their territory.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}} In the late Medieval era, states Prasse, the previously existing weapon monopoly of the nobility broke down after regional wars took a heavy toll on the noble warrior strata, and thereafter the vassals carried weapons as well and were recruited as warriors.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}} After the start of the French colonial rule, which deprived the nobles of their powers over war and taxation, the Tuaregs belonging to the noble strata disdained tending cattle and tilling the land, seeking instead soldiering or intellectual work.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}}

A semi-noble strata of the Tuareg people has been the endogamous religious clerics, the ''[[marabout]]s'' (Tuareg: ''Ineslemen'', a loan word that means Muslim in Arabic).{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}} After the adoption of Islam, they became integral to the Tuareg social structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stewart | first=C.

Prasse|1995|pp=17-18}}

====Castes====
[[File:Tahouapaysantouareg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A man from the peasant caste of the Tuareg near [[Tahoua]], [[Niger]]]]
According to the anthropologist Jeffrey Heath, Tuareg artisans belong to separate endogamous castes known as the ''Inhædˤæn'' (''[[Inadan (African caste)|Inadan]]'').&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt;{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=18}} These have included the blacksmith, jewelers, wood workers and leather artisan castes.&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt; They produced and repaired the saddles, tools, household items and other items for the Tuareg community. In Niger and Mali, where the largest Tuareg populations are found, the artisan castes were attached as clients to a family of nobles or vassals, and carried messages over distances for their patron family. They also are the ones who traditionally sacrifice animals during Islamic festivals.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=18}}

These social strata, like caste systems found in many parts of West Africa, included singers, musicians and story tellers of the Tuareg, who kept their [[oral tradition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David C. Conrad|author2=Barbara E. Frank|title=Status and Identity in West Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzeVS6pYS7YC&amp;pg=PA67|year=1995|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-11264-8|pages=67–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are called ''Agguta'' by Tuareg, have been called upon to sing during ceremonies such as weddings or funerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruth M. Stone|title=The Garland Handbook of African Music |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XEeTAgAAQBAJ |year=2010 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-90001-4|pages=249–250}}, Quote: "In Mali, Niger and southern Algeria, Tuareg griots of the artisanal caste practice a related tradition. Known to the Tuareg as agguta, they typically entertain at weddings (...)"&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the artisanal castes are unclear. One theory posits a [[Jews|Jewish]] derivation, a proposal that Prasse calls "a much vexed question".{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=18}} Their association with fire, iron and precious metals and their reputation for being cunning tradesmen has led others to treat them with a mix of admiration and distrust.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=18}}

According to Rasmussen, the Tuareg castes are not only hierarchical, as each caste differs in mutual perception, food and eating behaviors. For example, she relates an explanation by a smith on why there is [[endogamy]] among Tuareg castes in Niger. The smith explained, "nobles are like rice, smiths are like millet, slaves are like corn".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Rasmussen (1996), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3630236 Matters of Taste: Food, Eating, and Reflections on "The Body Politic" in Tuareg Society], Journal of Anthropological Research, University of Chicago Press, Volume 52, Number 1 (Spring, 1996), page 61, Quote: "'Nobles are like rice, smiths are like millet, and slaves are like corn', said Hado, a smith from the Kel Ewey conferdation of Tuareg near Moun Bagzan in northeastern Niger. He was explaining to me the reasons for endogamy."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Tuareg areas of Algeria, a distinct tenant-peasant strata lives around oases known as ''izeggaghan'' (or ''hartani'' in Arabic).{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=19-20}} Traditionally, these local peasants were subservient to the warrior nobles who owned the oasis and the land. The peasants tilled these fields, whose output they gave to the nobles after keeping a fifth part of the produce.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=19-20}} Their Tuareg patrons were usually responsible for supplying agricultural tools, seed and clothing. The peasants' origins are also unclear. One theory postulates that they are descendants of ancient people who lived in the Sahara before they were dominated by invading groups. Some speak a Songhay dialect along with Tuareg and Arabic. In contemporary times, these peasant strata have blended in with freed black slaves and farm arable lands together.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=19-20}}

====Slaves====
{{double image|right|COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van een Bella man met amuletten TMnr 20010119.jpg|120|COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van een Bella vrouw TMnr 20010118.jpg|132| ''Bellah'' constitute the historic slave strata within Tuareg society.&lt;ref name="Hall2011p5"/&gt;}}
The Tuareg confederations acquired slaves as well as tribute paying states by conducting raids on communities to their south in West Africa.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p499"/&gt; They also secured captives as war booty or purchased slaves in markets.{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|pp=18, 50-54}} The slaves or servile communities are locally called ''[[Ikelan]]'' (or ''Iklan'', ''Eklan''), and slavery was inherited, with the descendants of the slaves known as ''irewelen''.&lt;ref name="Gates2010p499"/&gt;{{Sfn|Karl G. Prasse|1995|p=18}}

According to the ethnographer Johannes Nicolaisen (1963), the Ikelan are of assimilated [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] origin rather than of Berber heritage like the ethnic Tuareg. They often live in communities separated from other castes. The Ikelan's Nilotic extraction is denoted via the [[Tamahaq language|Ahaggar Berber]] word ''Ibenheren'' (sing. ''Ébenher''), which alludes to slaves that only speak a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language. The slaves of the Tuareg were generally of Sub-Saharan African heritage (Nilo-Saharan or [[Niger-Congo]] ethno-linguistic origins) and were captured during raids.&lt;ref name="Nicolaisen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicolaisen|first1=Johannes|title=Ecology and Culture of the Pastoral Tuareg: With Particular Reference to the Tuareg of Ahaggar and Ayr|date=1963|publisher=National Museum of Copenhagen| page=16| url=https://www.google.com/books?id=hLUbAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the historian Starratt (1981), the Tuareg evolved a system of slavery that was highly differentiated. They established strata among their slaves, which determined rules as to the slave's expected behavior, marriageability, inheritance rights if any, and occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Starratt | first=Priscilla Ellen | title=Tuareg slavery and slave trade | journal=Slavery &amp; Abolition | publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis | volume=2 | issue=2 | year=1981 | pages=83–113 | doi=10.1080/01440398108574825 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ikelan'' later became a bonded caste within Tuareg society, and they now speak the same Tamasheq language as the Tuareg nobles and share many customs.&lt;ref name="Nicolaisen"/&gt; According to Heath, the ''Bella'' in the Tuareg society were the slave caste whose occupation was rearing and herding livestock such as sheep and goats.&lt;ref name="Heath2005p7"/&gt;

When French colonial governments were established, they stopped acquisition of new slaves and slave trading in markets, but they did not remove or free domestic slaves from the Tuareg owners who had acquired their slaves before the French rule started.{{Sfn|Karl G.

According to Bernus (1972), Brusberg (1985) and Mortimore (1972), French colonial interests in the Tuareg region were primarily economic, with no intention of ending the slave-owning institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/b_fdi_04-05/05798.pdf Edouard Bernus.

In 1946, a series of mass desertions of Tuareg slaves and bonded communities began in [[Nioro du Sahel|Nioro]] and later in [[Menaka]], quickly spreading along the Niger River valley.&lt;ref&gt;Klein (1998) pp. 234–251&lt;/ref&gt; In the first decade of the 20th century, French administrators in southern Tuareg areas of the French Sudan estimated that "free" to "servile" groups within Tuareg society existed at ratios of 1 to 8 or 9.&lt;ref name=Klein1998ApI&gt;Klein (1998) "Appendix I:How Many Slaves?" pp. 252–263&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the servile "''rimaibe''" population of the [[Masina, Kinshasa|Masina]] [[Fula people|Fulbe]], roughly equivalent to the ''Bella'', constituted between 70% to 80% of the Fulbe population, while servile Songhay groups around [[Gao]] made up some 2/3 to 3/4 of the total Songhay population.&lt;ref name=Klein1998ApI /&gt; Klein concludes that approximately 50% of the population of French Soudan at the beginning of the 20th century was in some servile or slave relationship.&lt;ref name=Klein1998ApI /&gt;

While post-independence states have sought to outlaw slavery, results have been mixed.

====Chronology====
[[File:Touareg-blacksmith.jpg|thumb|A Tuareg [[blacksmith]]]]
The Tuareg social stratification involving noble, clerical and artisanal castes likely emerged after the 10th century, as a corollary of the rising slavery system.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan McIntosh|editor=Christopher R.

Archaeological work by Rod McIntosh and Susan Keech McIntosh indicates that long-distance trade and specialized economies existed in the Western Sudan at an early date. During the 9th and 10th centuries, Berbers and Arabs built upon these pre-existing trade routes and quickly developed trans-Saharan and sub-Saharan transport networks. The successive local Muslim kingdoms developed increasing sophistication as states, their martial capacity, slave raiding, holding and trading systems. Among these Islamic states were the [[Ghana Empire]] (11th century), the [[Mali Empire]] (13th and 14th centuries), and the [[Songhay Empire]] (16th century).&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p17"/&gt; Slavery created a template for servile relationships, which developed into more complex castes and social stratification.&lt;ref name="DeCorse2001p19"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan McIntosh|editor=Christopher R.

[[File:Nomad-Tuaregs.jpg|thumb|Tuareg [[nomad]]s in southern Algeria]]
Tuareg culture is largely [[matrilineal]].&lt;ref name=Haven07&gt;{{cite web |last=Haven |first=Cynthia |url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2007/pr-tuareg-052307.html |title=New exhibition highlights the 'artful' Tuareg of the Sahara |quote=A Stanford Univ. news article of 23 May 2007 |publisher=News.stanford.edu |date=2007-05-23 |accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spain, Daphne (1992).

Untitled review of a 1963 major ethnographic study of the Tuareg. ''American Anthropologist, New Series, 68 (1966), No.2'', 554–556.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuareg women have high status compared with their [[Arab]] counterparts (see [[Matrilineality#Tuareg|matrilineality]]). Other distinctive aspects of Tuareg culture include clothing, food, language, religion, arts, astronomy, nomadic architecture, traditional weapons, music, films, games, and economic activities.

===Clothing=== &lt;!-- a redirect target for links from other articles --&gt;
In Tuareg society women do not traditionally wear the [[veil]], whereas men do.&lt;ref name=Haven07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Review66/&gt; The most famous Tuareg symbol is the ''[[Tagelmust]]'' (also called éghéwed and ''[[litham]]''), referred to as a Cheche (pronounced "Shesh"), an often indigo blue-colored veil called ''[[Alasho]]''. The men's facial covering originates from the belief that such action wards off evil spirits. It may have related instrumentally from the need for protection from the harsh desert sands as well. It is a firmly established tradition, as is the wearing of [[amulet]]s containing sacred objects and, recently, verses from the ''[[Qur'an]]''. Taking on the veil is associated with the rite of passage to manhood; men begin wearing a veil when they reach maturity. The veil usually conceals their face, excluding their eyes and the top of the nose.
[[File:Tuareg woman from Mali January 2007.jpg|thumb|Tuareg woman in traditional garb]]
[[File:Tuareg woman from Mali, 2007.jpg|thumb|Tuareg woman with face veil]]
* '''[[tagelmust]]''': turban – men
* '''[[alasho]]''': blue indigo veil – women and men
* '''[[bukar]]''': black cotton turban – men
* '''[[tasuwart]]''': women's veil
* '''[[takatkat]]''': shirt – women and men
* '''[[takarbast]]''': short shirt – women and men
* '''[[akarbey]]''': pants worn by men
* '''[[afetek]]''': loose shirt worn by women
* '''afer''': women's [[pagne]]
* '''tari''': large black pagne for winter season
* '''[[Burnous|bernuz]]''': long woolen cloth for winter
* '''[[akhebay]]''': loose bright green or blue cloth for women
* '''[[ighateman]]''': shoes
* '''[[iragazan]]''': red leather sandals
* '''[[ibuzagan]]''': leather shoes
The Tuareg are sometimes called the "Blue People" because the [[indigo]] pigment in the cloth of their traditional robes and turbans stained their skin dark blue.&lt;ref name="GearonEamonn" /&gt; The traditional indigo turban is still preferred for celebrations, and generally Tuareg wear clothing and turbans in a variety of colors.

===Food===
[[Taguella]] is a flat bread made from wheat flour and cooked on under charcoal fire, the flat disk-shaped bread is buried under the hot sand. The bread is broken into small pieces and eaten with a meat sauce. [[Millet]] [[porridge]] called '''a cink''' or '''a liwa''' is a staple much like [[ugali]] and [[fufu]]. Millet is boiled with water to make a pap and eaten with milk or a heavy sauce. Common [[dairy]] foods are goat's and [[Camel milk|camel's milk]] called '''akh''', as well as cheese '''ta komart''' and '''Tona''' a thick [[yogurt]] made from them. [[Eghajira]] is a beverage drunk with a [[ladle (spoon)|ladle]]. It is made by pounding millet, [[goat cheese]], [[date (fruit)|dates]], milk and sugar and is served on festivals. A popular tea called "atai" or "ashahi" is made from Gunpowder Green Tea mixed with sugar. After steeping, it is poured three times in and out of the tea pot over the tea, mint and sugar and served by pouring from a height of over a foot into small tea glasses with a froth on top.

===Language===
{{Main article|Tuareg languages}}
The Tuareg natively speak the [[Tuareg languages]]. A dialect cluster, it belongs to the [[Berber languages|Berber]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic family]]. Tuareg is known as ''[[Tamasheq language|Tamasheq]]'' by western Tuareg in Mali, as ''[[Tamahaq language|Tamahaq]]'' among Algerian and Libyan Tuareg, and as ''[[Air Tamajeq language|Tamajeq]]'' in the Azawagh and Aïr regions of Niger.

French missionary [[Charles de Foucauld]] compiled a dictionary of the Tuareg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naylor|first1=Phillip C.|title=Historical Dictionary of Algeria|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=0810879190|page=481|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=ftFbCQAAQBAJ|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts===
[[File:Mariage Touareg Niger10.jpg|thumb|A Tuareg husband and wife wearing traditional jewellery]]
Much Tuareg art is in the form of [[jewellery]], leather and metal saddle decorations called '''trik''', and finely crafted swords. The ''Inadan'' community makes traditional handicrafts. Among their products are [[tanaghilt]] or [[zakkat]] (the '[[Agadez Cross]]' or 'Croix d'Agadez'); the Tuareg sword ([[Takoba]]), many gold and silver-made necklaces called 'Takaza'; and earrings called 'Tizabaten'. Pilgrimage boxes have intricate iron and brass decorations, and are used for carrying items.

===Astronomy===
The clear desert skies allowed the Tuareg to be keen observers. Tuareg celestial objects include:
* Azzag Willi ([[Venus]]), which indicates the time for milking the goats
* Shet Ahad ([[Pleiades]]), the seven sisters of the night
* Amanar ([[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]), the warrior of the desert
* Talemt ([[Ursa Major]]), the she-camel wakes up
* Awara ([[Ursa Minor]]), the baby camel goes to sleep

===Nomadic architecture===
While living quarters are progressively changing to adapt to a more sedentary lifestyle, Tuareg groups are well known for their nomadic architecture ([[tent]]s). There are several documented styles, some covered with animal skin, some with mats. The style tends to vary by location or subgroup.&lt;ref&gt;Prussin, Labelle "African Nomadic Architecture" 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The tent is traditionally constructed for the first time during the marriage ceremony and is considered an extension of the union, to the extent that the phrase "making a tent" is a metaphor for becoming married.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scelta |first1=Gabe |year=2011 |title=Much to Learn About Living: Tuareg Architecture and Reﬂections of Knowledge |url=https://www.academia.edu/7963101/Much_to_Learn_About_Living_Tuareg_Architecture_and_Reflections_of_Knowledge |journal= |volume= |issue= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the tent is considered to be under the ownership of a married woman, sedentary dwellings generally belong to men, reflecting a patriarchal shift in power dynamics. Current documentation suggests a negotiation of common practice in which a woman's tent is set up in the courtyard of her husband's house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rasmussen |first1=Susan |year=1996 |title=The Tent as Cultural Symbol and Field Site: Social and Symbolic Space, "Topos", and Authority in a Tuareg Community |url= |journal=Anthropological Quarterly |volume=69 |issue= |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the traditional tent construction and arrangement of living space within it represent a microcosm of the greater world as an aide in the organization of lived experiences&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; so much so that movement away from the tent can cause changes in character for both men and women as its stabilizing force becomes faint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rasmussen |first1=Susan J. |year=1998 |title=Within the Tent and at the Crossroads: Travel and Gender Identity among the Tuareg of Niger |url= |journal=Ethos |volume=26 |issue=2 |page=164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An old legend says the Tuareg once lived in grottoes, ''akazam'', and they lived in foliage beds on the top [[acacia]] trees, ''tasagesaget''. Other kinds of traditional housing include:{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} ''ahaket'' (Tuareg goatskin red tent), ''tafala'' (a shade made of millet sticks), ''akarban'' also called ''takabart'' (temporary hut for winter), ''ategham'' (summer hut), ''taghazamt'' ([[adobe]] house for long stay), and ''ahaket'' (a dome-shaped house made of mats for the dry season and square shaped roof with holes to prevent hot air).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Traditional weapons===
[[File:Tuarick in a Shirt of Leather, Tuarick of Aghades.jpg|thumb|right|Armed Tuareg men depicted in a French book of 1821. Both men carry spears and the ''tellak'' dagger attached to the left forearm, the man on the right (a noble) is also armed with the ''takouba'' sword.]]
* '''[[takoba]]''': 1 meter long straight sword
* '''sheru''': long dagger
* '''tellak''': short dagger kept in a sheath attached to the left forearm.
* '''allagh''': 2 meter long lance
* '''tagheda''': small and sharp [[assegai]]
* '''taganze''': leather covered-wooden bow
* '''amur''': wooden arrow

* '''agher''': 1.50 meter high shield

In 2007, Stanford's Cantor Arts Center opened an exhibition, "Art of Being Tuareg: Sahara Nomads in a Modern World", the first such exhibit in the United States. It was curated by Tom Seligman, director of the center. He had first spent time with the Tuareg in 1971 when he traveled through the Sahara after serving in the [[Peace Corps]]. The exhibition included crafted and adorned functional objects such as camel saddles, tents, bags, swords, amulets, cushions, dresses, earrings, spoons and drums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.stanford.edu/news_room/Tuareg.html "First Exhibition of Tuareg Art and Culture in America Appears at Stanford Before Traveling to the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629051459/http://museum.stanford.edu/news_room/Tuareg.html |date=29 June 2007 }}, Cantor Arts Center&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition also was shown at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] Fowler Museum in Los Angeles and the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of African Art]] in Washington, D.C.

Throughout history, the Tuareg were renowned and respected warriors. Their decline as a military might came with the introduction of firearms, weapons which the Tuareg did not possess. The Tuareg warrior equipment consisted of a ''[[takoba]]'' (sword), ''[[allagh]]'' (lance) and ''aghar'' (shield) made of antelope's skin.

===Music===
{{further|Berber music}}
Traditional Tuareg music has two major components: the monochord violin ''[[anzad]]'' played often during night parties and a small ''[[tanbur|tambour]]'' covered with goatskin called ''[[tende]]'', performed during camel and horse races, and other festivities. Traditional songs called ''[[Asak (Tuareg)|Asak]]'' and ''[[Tisiway]]'' (poems) are sung by women and men during feasts and social occasions. Another popular Tuareg musical genre is ''[[takamba]]'', characteristic for its Afro percussions.

'''Vocal music'''
* '''tisiway''': poems
* '''tasikisikit''': songs performed by women, accompanied by tende (drum); the men, on camel-back, circle the women as they sing.
* '''asak''': songs accompanied by anzad monocord violin.
* '''tahengemmit''': slow songs sung by elder men

* '''Fadangama''' small monocord instrument for children
* '''Odili''' flute made from trunk of sorghum
* '''Gidga''' small wooden instrument with irons sticks to make strident sounds

'''Dance'''

* ewegh: strong dance performed by men, in couples and groups.
* agabas: dance for modern ishumar guitars: women and men in groups.

In the 1980s rebel fighters founded [[Tinariwen]], a Tuareg band that fuses electric guitars and indigenous musical styles. Tinariwen is one of the best known and authentic Tuareg bands. Especially in areas that were cut off during the [[Tuareg rebellion (1990–1995)|Tuareg rebellion]] (e.g., Adrar des Iforas), they were practically the only music available, which made them locally famous and their songs/lyrics (e.g. Abaraybone, ...) are well known by the locals. They released their first CD in 2000, and toured in Europe and the United States in 2004. Tuareg guitar groups that followed in their path include [[Group Inerane]] and [[Group Bombino]]. The Niger-based band ''[[Etran Finatawa]]'' combines Tuareg and ''[[Wodaabe]]'' members, playing a combination of traditional instruments and electric guitars.

Many music groups emerged after the 1980s cultural revival. Among the Tartit, Imaran and known artists are: Abdallah Oumbadougou from Ayr, Baly Othmany of Djanet.

===Economy===
[[File:Touareg-craftmanship.jpg|thumb|right| Tuareg selling crafts to tourists in the [[Ahaggar Mountains|Hoggar]] (Algeria)]]

Tuareg are distinguished in their native language as the ''Imouhar'', meaning the free people{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}; the overlap of meaning has increased local cultural nationalism. 
Many Tuareg today are either settled agriculturalists or nomadic cattle breeders, though there are also [[blacksmith]]s and [[camel train|caravan]] leaders. The Tuareg are a [[pastoral]] people, having an economy based on livestock breeding, trading, and agriculture.&lt;ref name="smithsonian1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africa.si.edu/exhibits/tuareg/who.html|title=Who are the Tuareg?|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caravan Trade'''

Since Prehistoric times Tuareg peoples: the Garamantes have been organising caravans for trading across the Sahara desert. The caravan in Niger from around Agadez to Fachi and Bilma is called in Tamashek: '''Tarakaft''' or '''Taghlamt''' and the one in Mali from Timbuktu to Taoudenni '''Azalay'''.

These caravans used first oxen, horses and later camels as a means of transportation, here different types of caravans:
* caravans transporting food: dates, millet, dried meat, dried Tuareg cheese, butter etc.
* caravans transporting garments, alasho indigo turbans, leather products, ostrich feathers,
* caravans transporting salt: [[salt caravans]] used for exchange against other products.
* caravans transporting nothing but made to sell and buy camels.

Salt mines or '''salines''' in the desert.
* [[Tin Garaban]] near Ghat in [[Azjar]], Libya.
* [[Amadghor]] in Ahaggar, Algeria.
* [[Taoudenni]] in far northern Mali.
* [[Tagidda N Tesemt]] in Azawagh, Niger
* [[Fachi]] in Ténéré desert, Niger
* [[Bilma]] in Kawar, eastern Niger

A contemporary variant is occurring in northern Niger, in a traditionally Tuareg territory that comprises most of the uranium-rich land of the country. The central government in [[Niamey]] has shown itself unwilling to cede control of the highly profitable mining to indigenous clans.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The Tuareg are determined not to relinquish the prospect of substantial economic benefit. The French government has independently tried to defend a French firm, Areva, established in Niger for fifty years and now mining the massive Imouraren deposit.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Additional complaints against Areva are that it is: "...plundering...the natural resources and [draining] the fossil deposits. It is undoubtedly an ecological catastrophe".&lt;ref&gt;Pádraig Carmody. The New Scramble for Africa. Polity. (2011) {{ISBN|9780745647852}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mines yield uranium ores, which are then processed to produce ''[[yellowcake]]'', crucial to the nuclear power industry (as well as aspirational nuclear powers). In 2007, some Tuareg people in Niger allied themselves with the [[Niger Movement for Justice]] (MNJ), a rebel group operating in the north of the country. During 2004–2007, U.S. Special Forces teams trained Tuareg units of the [[Nigerien Army]] in the Sahel region as part of the Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership. Some of these trainees are reported to have fought in [[Second Tuareg Rebellion|the 2007 rebellion]] within the MNJ. The goal of these Tuareg appears to be economic and political control of ancestral lands, rather than operating from religious and political ideologies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Despite the Sahara's erratic and unpredictable rainfall patterns, the Tuareg have managed to survive in the hostile desert environment for centuries. Over recent years however, depletion of water by the uranium exploitation process combined with the effects of climate change are threatening their ability to subsist. Uranium mining has diminished and degraded Tuareg grazing lands. Not only does the mining industry produce radioactive waste that can contaminate crucial sources of ground water resulting in cancer, stillbirths, and genetic defects but it also uses up huge quantities of water in a region where water is already scarce. This is exacerbated by the increased rate of desertification thought to be the result of global warming. Lack of water forces the Tuareg to compete with southern farming communities for scarce resources and this has led to tensions and clashes between these communities. The precise levels of environmental and social impact of the mining industry have proved difficult to monitor due to governmental obstruction.

[[Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] is the most common paternal haplogroup among the Tuareg. Most belong to its [[E1b1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b1b]] (E-M81) subclade, which is colloquially referred to as the ''Berber marker'' due to its prevalence among [[Mozabite people|Mozabite]], [[Middle Atlas]], [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] and other Berber groups. It reaches frequencies of up to 100 percent in some parts of the [[Maghreb]], and is dominated by its sub-clade E-M183. The clade is thought to have originated in North Africa around 14200 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yfull.com/tree/E-M81/|title=E-M81 YTree|website=www.yfull.com|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its parent haplogroup E1b1b is associated with Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations, and is believed to have arisen in the Horn of Africa.&lt;ref name="Cruciani2004"&gt;{{Cite journal |last11=Lavinha |first11=João |last1=Cruciani |first1=Fulvio |last2=Fratta |first2=Roberta La |last3=Santolamazza |first3=Piero |last4=Sellitto |first4=Daniele |last5=Pascone |first5=Roberto |last6=Moral |first6=Pedro |last7=Watson |first7=Elizabeth |last8=Guida |first8=Valentina |last9=Colomb |first9=Eliane Beraud |author10=Boriana Zaharova |last12=Vona |first12=Giuseppe |last13=Aman |first13=Rashid |last14=Calì |first14=Francesco |last15=Akar |first15=Nejat |last16=Richards |first16=Martin |last17=Torroni |first17=Antonio |last18=Novelletto |first18=Andrea |last19=Scozzari |first19=Rosaria  |title=Phylogeographic analysis of haplogroup E3b (E-M215) y chromosomes reveals multiple migratory events within and out of Africa |journal=Am.

Besides E1b1b, Pereira et al. (2011) and Ottoni et al. (2011) observed that certain Tuareg inhabiting Niger and Libya carry the [[Haplogroup E-V38|E1b1a]] haplogroup (see table above). This clade is today primarily found among [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]]-speaking populations, which suggests that some Tuareg tribes in parts of Libya and Niger may have assimilated many persons of West African origin into their communities.&lt;ref name="Ottoni2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pereira2011"/&gt; To wit, around 50% of individuals among the Al Awaynat Tuareg in Libya are E1b1a carriers compared to only 11% of the adjacent Tahala Tuareg. 89% of the Tahala belong instead to the E1b1b Tuareg founding lineage.&lt;ref name="Ottoni2011"/&gt;

===mtDNA===
According to mtDNA analysis by Ottoni et al. (2010), the Tuareg inhabiting the Fezzan region in Libya predominantly carry the [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H1]] haplogroup (61%). This is the highest global frequency found so far of the maternal clade. The haplogroup peaks among Berber populations, and is thought to have arrived from the Iberian Peninsula during the Holocene. The remaining Libyan Tuareg mainly belong to two other West Eurasian mtDNA lineages, [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|M1]] and [[Haplogroup V (mtDNA)|V]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ottoni|year=2010|title=Mitochondria Haplogroup H1 in North Africa: An Early Holocene Arrival from Iberia|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.350.6514&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=5|issue=10|page=e13378|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0013378|pmid=20975840|pmc=2958834}}&lt;/ref&gt; M1 is today most common among other Afro-Asiatic speakers inhabiting East Africa, and is believed to have arrived on the continent along with the [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U6]] haplogroup around 40,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Pereira2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Luísa Pereira|author2=Viktor Černý|author3=María Cerezo |author4=Nuno M Silva |author5=Martin Hájek |author6=Alžběta Vašíková |author7=Martina Kujanová |author8=Radim Brdička |author9=Antonio Salas |title=Linking the sub-Saharan and West Eurasian gene pools: maternal and paternal heritage of the Tuareg nomads from the African Sahel|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=17 March 2010|volume=18|pages=915–923|url=http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v18/n8/full/ejhg201021a.html|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2010.21 |pmid=20234393 |pmc=2987384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pereira et al. (2010) observed greater matrilineal heterogeneity among the Tuareg inhabiting more southerly areas in the Sahel. The Tuareg in the Gossi environs in Mali largely bear the H1 haplogroup (52%), with the M1 lineage (19%) and various Sub-Saharan [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2]] subclades (19%) next most common. Similarly, most of the Tuareg inhabiting Gorom-Gorom in Burkina Faso carry the H1 haplogroup (24%), followed by various L2 subclades (24%), the V lineage (21%), and haplogroup M1 (18%). The Tuareg in the vicinity of Tanout in Maradi Region and westward to villages of Loube and Djibale in Tahoua Region in Niger are different from the other Tuareg populations in that a majority carry Sub-Saharan mtDNA lineages.  In fact, the name for these mixed blood Tuareg-Haussa people is "Djibalawaa" named after the village of Djibale in Bouza Department, Tahoua Region of Niger. This points to significant assimilation of local West African females into this community. The most common maternal haplogroups found among the Tanout Tuareg are various L2 subclades (39%), followed by [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3]] (26%), various [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1]] sublineages (13%), V (10%), H1 (3%), M1 (3%), [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U3a]] (3%), and [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0a1a]] (3%).&lt;ref name="Pereira2010"/&gt;

'''Ukrainian mafia''' is a type of criminal organization with origins in [[Ukraine]]. Such organizations are regarded as one of the most influential types of organized crime coming out of the former [[USSR]] next to the established [[Russian mafia]], [[Georgian mafia]], [[Chechen mafia]], [[Armenian mafia]] and [[Azerbaijani mafia]]. Ukrainian criminal organizations are involved in a vast amount of illegitimate enterprises. Although Ukrainian criminal organizations are for the most part independently operating enterprises they are most closely connected with [[Russian mafia]] organizations, as is the case with [[Semyon Mogilevich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/events/panorama/transcripts/transcript_06_12_99.txt|title=Panorama: The Billion Dollar Don|work=BBC|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following the collapse of the former [[Soviet Union]], there were large stockpiles of arms left in [[Ukraine]]. The first prominence of the '''Ukrainian mafia''' came through their participation in the illicit international trafficking in these arms. Between 1992 and 1998, some $32 billion in military material disappeared from military depots in Ukraine and ended up primarily in [[West Africa]] and [[Central Asia]]. Allegedly, Ukrainian criminal organizations were also behind trafficking weapons to war-torn places such as Afghanistan at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=-L8B8ydtHZ4C&amp;q=ukrainian#v=snippet&amp;q=ukrainian&amp;f=false|title=Organized Crime|publisher=Books.google.be|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From trafficking in arms, Ukrainian crime syndicates entered into the international trade in illegal drugs, becoming a major player in the narcotics traffic from Central Asia to Central Europe. The reach of Ukrainian gangs has become extended, having been reported from Central European countries such as the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Hungary]], where they're involved in prostitution, to North American countries and Israel, where they founded a significant power base following the mass immigration of [[Ukrainian Jews]] which among the many law-abiding people had also criminal elements profiting from the open borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/198321.pdf|format=PDF|title=Organized Crime in Ukraine: Challenge and Response|publisher=Ncjrs.gov|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Odessa mafia/ Malina==
The most infamous form of Ukrainian organized crime, and the one which became the most famous, is the so-called '''Odessa mafia''' named after the Black Sea port city of [[Odessa]]. Odessa is an infamous smugglers’ haven and a key hub in post-Soviet global trafficking networks, not least moving Europe-bound Afghan heroin arriving from the Caucasus. Even in Ukraine's west, gangs are often closely involved in the lucrative trafficking of heroin, people, and counterfeit cigarettes into Europe, often in cooperation with [[Russian mafia]] gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/05/01/ukraines-mob-war/|title=Ukraine’s Mob War|work=Foreign Policy|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Odessa traditionally had an ancient culture of banditry, dating back to the large and impoverished Jewish population. Famous writers such as [[Isaac Babel]] often wrote about the infamous exploits of Jewish gangsters, thieves and crime lords in the port city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/culture/2/Literature/Yiddish_and_Ladino/European_Writing/Isaac_Babel.shtml|title=Gangsters, beggars, prostitutes and other inhabitants of Jewish Odessa.|publisher=Myjewishlearning.com|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20th century thuggery made way for sophisticated organized crime when local crime lords began to use the city's sprawling port to their advantage. The at first locally active ''Odessa mafia'', sometimes also called the '''Malina''', became well known when it branched out to [[New York City]] at first and later on [[Israel]], when both countries gave the opportunity to Soviet Jews to immigrate. Many people from Odessa's Jewish population migrated abroad, among them a large part of the city's most infamous career criminals. Although the gang was born in the city of Odessa, it has since established most of its headquarters in cities such as [[New York City]], [[Miami]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Antwerp]] and [[Budapest]] with brigades composed of former Odessan or Odessa-connected criminals active in a large amount of other cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GN54aY1YVigC&amp;pg=PA147 |title=In the Golden Land|via=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]] the Odessa mafia is based in the [[Brighton Beach]] district of Brooklyn, New York. It is regarded as the most powerful post-Soviet criminal organization in the US and has since expanded its operations to [[Miami]] and [[Los Angeles]], where it has established connections with locally based Armenian and Israeli crime figures, along with [[San Francisco Bay]]. It's known for being a very secretive organization, being involved in protection rackets, loan-sharking, murder-for-hire, as well as the infamous fuel tax fraud rackets and narcotics trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=-L8B8ydtHZ4C&amp;q=ukrainian#v=onepage&amp;q=odessa%20mafia&amp;f=false |title=Organized Crime |via=[[Google Books]] |accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless a large amount of Odessa Mafia-connected gangsters have become part of the US' criminal folklore, examples being [[Marat Balagula]], [[Evsei Agron]] and [[Boris Nayfeld]]. Feuds, often resulting in extreme violence, happened in the 1980s and 1990s between Odessa gangsters such as the internal war between Balagula and Agron at first, and later on between the Nayfeld brothers and Monya Elson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2-dance-bullet-ballet-article-1.762670|title=2 DANCE BULLET BALLET|work=NY Daily News|accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The group was founded in February 1954 in Los Angeles, California by [[Ernest L. Norman]] (1904–1971)&lt;ref name="zeller2"&gt;Zeller, Benjamin E. (2009). Apocalyptic thought in UFO-based religions. In Kinane, Karolyn and Michael A. Ryan, eds. ''End of days: essays on the apocalypse from antiquity to modernity'' McFarland, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4204-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife [[Ruth E. Norman]] (1900–1993).&lt;ref name="bloom1993"&gt;Bloom, Barry M. (July 29, 1993). Ruth Norman, 92; poet, humanitarian, cosmic visionary. ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

From the period of 1954–1971, when Ernest Norman still controlled the organization, the organization defined "the mission" as the explanation and promotion of an interdimensional science of life in the books he wrote. He said that he had [[Mediumship#Channeling|channeled]] the material via his psychic connections with extraterrestrial intelligences.

Between 1972–1993, while Ruth Norman guided it, the organization experienced renewed growth and public awareness.&lt;ref name=tumm/&gt; "The mission" became bringing Unarius to the masses. Ruth Norman granted interviews, appeared on [[Late Night with David Letterman]] and [[David Susskind Show|The David Susskind Show]] and kept very up-to-date technologically with a video production studio built in the late 1970s, when such equipment was still in its infancy. Unarius video productions began appearing on [[Public-access television]] [[cable TV]] stations all over the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Unarius Light Newsletter, 1978–80&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Diana Tumminia stated that in several cities in Southern California, the local public access channels carried weekly showings of Unarian films.&lt;ref name=t2000/&gt;

Unarius has been featured in countless newspaper and magazine articles as well as radio and television spots.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia (1995) p85&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ruth Norman's death in 1993, Charles Louis Spiegel&lt;ref name=T2005p165&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) p165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2003) p65-67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) p193&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as  Antares) became director, a post he retained until his death in December 22, 1999.&lt;ref name=S2003p192&gt;Saliba, John A. (2003) p192&lt;/ref&gt; Since Ruth Norman's death in 1993, the organization has struggled, particularly since 2001, when a space-fleet landing predicted by Charles Spiegel in 1980 failed to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/11398098.html?dids=11398098:11398098&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+07%2C+1997&amp;author=DUANE+NORIYUKI&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Age+of+Unarius%3B+El+Cajon+Group+Believes+UFOs+are+Coming+to+Them+in+2001&amp;pqatl=google|title=Age of Unarius; El Cajon Group Believes UFOs are Coming to Them in 2001|last=Noriyuki|first=Duane|date=April 7, 1997|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unariuns&lt;ref&gt;Although often spelt ''Unarian'' other in sources (using the standard English suffix [[Wiktionary:-ian|''-ian'']]), the word is invariably spelt ''Unariun'' on the Academy's website (see the "External links" section below).&lt;/ref&gt; believe in [[immortality]] of the soul, and that all people have [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] many times.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia (2005) p6&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe that our [[solar system]] was once inhabited by ancient interplanetary civilizations.

The aliens are said to be "human beings" who have lived on Earth and on other planets outside our solar system.  They are said to be more advanced than humans, spiritually and scientifically.&lt;ref name=S2003p194&gt;Saliba, John A. (2003) p194&lt;/ref&gt;

While the group seems to have similarity to the [[Aetherius Society]] or to [[Raëlism]], as they emphasize "space brothers" who will come from the stars in 33 spaceships to improve humanity, these beliefs are not held by all Unariuns and in fact, are discounted by many as contradictory to true Unariun principles.

In his book, ''The Truth About Mars'', Ernest Norman claimed that the [[China|Chinese]] evolved from ancient interstellar migrants who began colonizing [[Mars]] a million years ago. They are reported to have returned to Mars, where they live in underground cities, after being attacked by natives of the Earth. A group which had become separated did not return with them and this group branched off and formed the various Asian racial genotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Norman; The Truth About Mars, 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founders ==
Ernest Norman claimed to have been a child prodigy, having read all his father's (a physician from [[Scandinavia]]) books eagerly, self-educating himself alongside his formal schooling. He also claimed that as a child, he performed to family, neighbors and teachers unexpected feats such as moving a heavy rabbit hutch using Archimedean principles and small logs, building radios and winning arguments with parents and teachers at an early age. According to Unarius, Ernest Norman was a scientist, and  an aeronautical engineer from whom the idea of the television tube was stolen.&lt;ref name=T2005&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) p37&lt;/ref&gt;

Claiming to possess [[psychic]] ability, he began his metaphysical career reading palms and also claimed to have told women of their loved one's whereabouts and often deaths during the [[World War II]] years of 1942–1945.&lt;ref name=T2005/&gt; When this practice of describing fatalities allegedly lowered morale at war plants where he worked, he left and started to give lectures of his own philosophy in theosophical churches during the mid to late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Norman; ''Biography of Unarius'', 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Previous to meeting Ruth and the beginning of their mission, Ernest Norman gave psychic readings at spiritualist churches.&lt;ref name=T1995p86&gt;Tumminia, Diana (1995) p86&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Norman was the oldest of eight children, born in 1900. She took many jobs early on to help support her family, and worked as a fruit packer, and at other various jobs, including as a live-in maid.  Her first marriage produced a daughter.  After this she worked at many jobs including store clerk, nanny, short-order cook, waitress, ran a real estate office and eventually owned and managed some property.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) pp163-4&lt;/ref&gt; She had purchased a motel, run a restaurant, worked at a cannery and worked in numerous other professions during her first fifty years.

Both Ernest and Ruth had experiences in Spiritualism before the UFO theme became common in the late 1940s.&lt;ref name=zeller/&gt;&lt;ref name=C2006p588&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Peter B. editor|title=Encyclopedia of new religious movements|date=2006|page=588}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1950s, mystics at a psychic convention she attended told her that she was being followed around by long-bearded wise men carrying books and that she would help bring in these books in her future. This same thing had been told to Ernest by other mystics at this same convention and when the two met and later married. Books date their marriage to 1954, and their anniversary is celebrated by Unarius on February 14.  Tumminia states that their union brought forth their "mission".&lt;ref name=T2005p164/&gt;&lt;ref name=T1995p86/&gt;

Within weeks, Ernest began to produce, by channeling, the first Unarius book, ''The Voice of Venus''.&lt;ref&gt;Norman; ''Bridge to Heaven'', 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth was later known within the group as both "Ioshanna" (1972–1979) and "Uriel" (1980–1993).

== Early years ==
Ernest Norman became a "channeler", the process by which he "wrote" his books.  Unarian channeling is a process of relaxed contemplation in which the practitioner closes the eyes and enters into a composed state, allowing thoughts and images to flow freely, as he or she voices "messages" received from a supposedly higher consciousness, or "other beings" which speak to or through him or her.&lt;ref name="T2005"/&gt; Coupling "channeling" with "past life" readings, the Normans developed a devoted following.

Ernest Norman's first books contain themes similar to those of other metaphysical American religions and early 1950s [[contactee]]s.  While the Normans had dealings with other early contactee groups, initially Ernest Norman concerned himself with the "spiritual nature" of planets and their supposed history.  He briefly mentioned flying saucers, saying that residents of more "spiritual" worlds were concerned about [[Atomic testing]] and responded by making their spacecraft visible and increasing contact with Earth people in order to attract attention.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) p38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saliba, John A. (2003) p195&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernest Norman claimed to receive ‘transmissions’ from Mars and Venus, the homes of ‘great teachers’ and [[Ascended Masters]] who described their cities to him.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (1995) pp86,88&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether, channeled descriptions of seven spiritual planets including Venus, claimed to be ‘advanced teaching centers’, comprise the set of books known as the "Pulse of Creation Series".&lt;ref name=T1995p86/&gt;

The Normans operated out of their home, and in the 60s and early 70s, they moved to different cities in California, eventually settling in [[Escondido, California|Escondido]].&lt;ref name="T1995p88"/&gt;  During that time, Norman and Ruth claimed past lives as [[Jesus]] and [[Mary Magdalene]] respectively, as well as other famous people.&lt;ref name="T1995p88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C2006p588"/&gt;&lt;ref name="T2000p300"&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2000) p300&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1970, Norman channeled his prime lesson book for a student of the science, "The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation".&lt;ref name="T1995p88"/&gt;&lt;ref name="T2005p166"&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the mission in February, 1954 by Ernest and Ruth Norman, led to the publication of the "Voice Series" of books. The first book, ‘Voice of Venus’ (1956), concerned a [[Astral projection|a psychic trip]] to Venus and described the advanced wonders of that civilization.  Now known as ‘the Moderator’, he explained the existence of ‘healing wards’ on that planet where troubled souls go to recuperate from traumatic experiences.&lt;ref name=T2003/&gt; He explained this book was not channeled in the usual type of meditative, trance-like state or in a darkened room, but spoken normally and recorded on tape. Norman generally held modern [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] movements and practices to be backwards and less enlightened. The work describes communication from Mal-Var of [[Venus]] who gives a tour of the Venusian capital. In the work, [[Venusians]] are described as having "energy bodies" and living in a [[Etheric plane|higher vibratory plane]] that would be [[invisible]] to a human were he to stand in the middle of the capital city known as ''Azure''. The planet Venus and its culture are said to be more spiritual than that of the [[Earth]] and that more advanced Earth-dwellers visit and study on Venus when they sleep. Healing wards for human [[suicides]], [[alcoholism|alcoholics]], the [[mentally disabled|mentally impaired]] and similar human wreckage exist in Azure and these souls are treated with positive energy and light to help them [[reincarnate]] with greater integration.&lt;ref&gt;Norman; ''Voice of Venus'', 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

The Voice Series consists of seven books:
* ''The Voice of Venus''
* ''The Voice of Eros''
* ''The Voice of Orion''
* ''The Voice of Hermes''
* ''The Voice of Muse, Unarius &amp; Elysium''

The seven books describe the seven planes of [[Shambhala|Shamballa]], which are claimed to exist outside the conventional [[atom]]ic spectrum and are spiritual or non-physical [[world]]s. Each plane has a specialty in the teaching of advanced principles, for the betterment of an individual's progressive evolution from life to life.

The planes' specialties are:
* Venus – Healing
* Eros – Science
* Orion – Education
* Hermes – Philosophy
* Muse – The Arts
* Unarius – Leadership
* Elysium – Devotion

These books authored by Ernest Norman, along with ''The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation'', which were a series of 13 lectures given in 1956 and later compiled into book form with seven advanced lesson courses, constitute the early teachings and beliefs of Unarius. The ''Voice Series'' books are written with famous past Earth denizens acting as the tour guides for these various planes.

== Origin of name ==
Unarius is an [[acronym]] which stands for "Universal Articulate Interdimensional Understanding of Science".&lt;ref name=T1995p102/&gt;&lt;ref name="hillinger" /&gt;&lt;ref name=S2003p192/&gt;&lt;ref name=C2006p588/&gt;

==Classification as a religion==
Unarius, as an organization, is strongly opposed to its common classification as a religion.&lt;ref name=T2007p85&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2007) p85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=S2003p199&gt;Saliba, John A. (2003) p199&lt;/ref&gt; Unarians consider their teaching or beliefs as a science and not a religion&lt;ref name=T2007p85/&gt; and assert that they practice  a science that teaches the 'spiritual' understanding of high energy-physics and reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2003) p62&lt;/ref&gt;

Saliba points out that Unarius lacks the main elements that one normally associates with religion, e.g. a hierarchical structure, priests and clergy, initiation rites, weekly services or ceremonies.  Neither do the members offer prayers to God or higher entities. Unarius feels more comfortable with the world ‘spiritual’, and admits that its teachings are ‘spiritual’ and that human beings have a spiritual nature.&lt;ref&gt;Saliba, John A. (2003) pp199-200&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding, the beliefs of Unarius do satisfy many religious criteria in that spiritual reality is taught: humans develop their spiritual potential over lifetimes; the concept of the Space Brothers is basically a supernatural assumption as they seem different in kind, and are empirically unprovable; it involves a western concept of good and evil and an eastern concept of karma; higher entities are channeled; the texts read like sacred scriptures; its system of beliefs can explain or dispel all phenomena, and thus satisfy all questions of meaning for adherents.. Because of this many writers regard it as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;Saliba, John A. (2003) pp200-201, p204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) pp186-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernest Norman presents the case against religion in several books, most notably ''The Infinite Contact'', copyrighted in 1960, which describes in detail the origins of Christianity as rooted in [[Mithraism]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and assorted ancient belief structures. Norman agreed with [[Karl Marx]] that religions were "[[Opium of the People|the opium of the people]]", and yet also claimed to realize that many individuals were still at such a point in their [[evolution]] where religions still served a positive purpose and kept them from harming their fellowmen. Unarius calls its content and activities teaching "interdimensional science".

== Principles and beliefs ==
Unarius was established to teach the 'fourth-dimensional science’ aka "the Science of Life"&lt;ref name=T2003/&gt; which incorporates harmonic frequencies, karma, reincarnation, past-life memories, channeling, and an elaborate cosmology of ‘spiritual planets.’ Central tenets of the belief system include contact with the ‘Space Brothers’ and a millenarian prophecy that predicts a mass landing of starships.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) pp5-7&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Science" asserts that everything is energy: atoms, higher knowledge, our bodies and our experiences.   This energy ‘vibrates in frequencies and wave forms’.  ‘Understanding’ these vibrational energies allows contact with all things: higher intelligence, the ‘advanced teaching centers’ and our ‘past lives’.  By being ‘in tune with spiritual frequencies’ we can heal ourselves of mental and physical illness.&lt;ref name=T1995p88/&gt;

Saliba summarises Unarian belief under four basic themes: [1] intelligent life on other planets/galaxies; [2] an infinite creative intelligence (God);  [3] that human beings are developing into an advanced state of consciousness;  [4] the millennial hope of the advent of a landing.&lt;ref name=S2003p194/&gt;  According to Unarius, the purpose of the research institution is "to awaken the individual to previous life encounters, the clairvoyant aptitude of the mind, and the reality of one's spiritual connection."&lt;ref&gt;Saliba, John A. (2003) p197&lt;/ref&gt;

Practicing Unariuns hold the following beliefs:
* Everything is energy.
* [[Energy is never created or destroyed]], it merely changes form.
* You are energy and the energy that comprises you is never destroyed, it just changes form.
* You, as a form of indestructible energy, possess a soul that has recorded data from past lives.
* All that is currently happening to you has their origins in past lives and past actions.
* To progress one must record more positive actions than negative actions.
* Negative acts must be compensated for by positive acts.
* Various strata exist (outside of physical worlds) where beings of higher and lower nature reside.

These are the primary principles as explained by Norman in ''The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation'', Copyright 1956, 1960 Edition.

For the practicing Unariun these are the most important aspects of Unarius. Although the group is generally known for its predictions regarding [[flying saucers]] landing on Earth, Ernest L. Norman stressed these scientific core understandings as the key to personal development and mastery over material circumstances and in one instance derided flying saucer chasers as just another manifestation of people pursuing an "escape mechanism".&lt;ref&gt;Norman; ''The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation'', 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 1970s ==
With the death of co-founder Ernest in 1971, the mission was continued by his wife and partner Ruth. New ''Sub-Channels'' now authored the books with her. The two sub-channels, Thomas Miller (Cosmon) and Louis Spiegel (Antares), are credited on a number of the organization's books starting in 1972.&lt;ref name=T1995p88/&gt;&lt;ref name=T2005p165/&gt;

After a channeling revealed a lifetime lived in ancient [[Atlantis]] with the name ''Ioshanna'', she adopted the name ''Ioshanna'' during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1083751452.html?dids=1083751452:1083751452&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+25%2C+1986&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Unarius+Students+Await+Dawning+of+a+New+Age&amp;pqatl=google|title=Unarius Students Await Dawning of a New Age|last=Granberry|first=Mike|date=October 26, 1986|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether she claimed over 200 previous lives.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2003) p67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) Appendix III&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of Unarian cosmology and lore revolves around the past lives of Uriel.&lt;ref name=T2000p300/&gt;

From 1954–1974, meetings were held in Ruth Norman's home or at public meeting facilities.&lt;ref name="Unarius Light, 1975"&gt;''Unarius Light'', 1975&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the channeled messages referred to "33 worlds of an interplanetary confederation". These worlds all had various problems and by communicating with Ioshanna, many of their hang-ups were solved or on the way to resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Miller, Spiegel; ''33 Worlds Speak to Earth'', 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth became an exuberant visionary, and with help rapidly increased the ‘messages from space’.   In 1973, she became known as ‘Uriel the Archangel’ said to be her ‘higher self’ and to stand for Universal, Radiant Infinite Eternal Light.&lt;ref name=S2003p192/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (1995) pp88-89&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1973, Uriel purchased 67 acres in Jamul, California, for a proposed landing site for the Space Brothers.&lt;ref name=T2005p166/&gt;

In 1974, in the "Tesla Speaks" volumes, Uriel completely redefined the Unarian mission by introducing the concept of the Interplanetary Confederation and the prophecy of a 33 vehicle spacefleet landing, in which she began to play the role of cosmic emissary uniting the confederation.  The media joined in, the landing date was revised, and eventually pushed back to 2001.  All unfulfilled prophecies were explained as being a reliving of Unarian past lives in the Isis-Osiris cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) pp38-42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (1995) pp89-93&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the organization moved its base from Glendale, California to El Cajon, California where a store front center was opened.&lt;ref name="tumm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (1995) p93&lt;/ref&gt;   Unarius was also incorporated as a non-profit, tax-exempt, educational foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) pp166-7&lt;/ref&gt; In El Cajon, Uriel became well known for driving a blue 1969 Cadillac Coupe d’Ville adorned with airbrushed depictions of spaceships with a large metal flying saucer on the roof; the car remains with Unarius and is driven every year in the annual El Cajon Mother Goose Parade.&lt;ref name = "Schmidt" /&gt;

In 1976, ‘past life’ therapy (called ‘psychic group therapy’) became formalised as part of the curriculum, eventually became the main activity of students, and was regarded as a healing practice.&lt;ref name=S2003p199/&gt;&lt;ref name=T2005p167&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) p167&lt;/ref&gt; The content of Unarian belief increased as these revelations evolved into collective biographies of members who are believed to have acted under Uriel on Earth and many other planets throughout millennia.  Tumminia comments that this type of collective weaving of past-life narratives as a regular practice of intersubjectivity may be unique to Unarius.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) p7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (1995) p93-96&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Unariuns were skeptical about the future predictions of a spacefleet landing, also channeled by Louis Spiegel. Many Unariuns felt that these predictions undermined the original mission of Ernest Norman and a falling out occurred. Circa 1980, Thomas Miller, the primary sub-channel, left the organization, leaving Louis Spiegel as the only sub-channel.&lt;ref name="Unarius Light, 1980"&gt;''Unarius Light'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; From this point forward, ever more activities revolved around these predictions. Ruth Norman, now 80, participated less and less in the goings on at the center and so Unariuns turned primarily to Louis Spiegel (aka "Antares", "Vaughn" and "Charles") for guidance and instruction.&lt;ref&gt;''Unarius Light'', 1981–88&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, a "Conclave of Light" celebration was staged at the U.S. Grant Hotel in [[San Diego]], California and repeated yearly at different venues, and after 1975, at the Unarius center in El Cajon, California.&lt;ref name="Unarius Light, 1975" /&gt; Every October, they stage their "Interplanetary Conclave of Light", which will include a visit to the Jamul landing site, the release of white doves, and 90 minutes of "mental communication with the Space Brothers."&lt;ref name = "Schmidt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/sep/17/la-mesas-wizard-of-weird-walks-on-the-wilder-side/?page=1#article|title=David Moye, La Mesa's wizard of weird, works the wilder side|last=Schmidt|first=Steve|date=September 17, 2012|work=San Diego Union Tribune|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 70s, Unarius started to make films and videos.&lt;ref name=T2005p167/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (1995) p94&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schism ==
Unarius generally has two types of students: the followers of Ernest Norman's original texts and works and those who believe in every channeling that occurred after his death. The latter group is often blamed by the former for the ridicule and mockery the organization has received by the general public since the early 1980s and more so in the [[Internet]] age for the conversion of the group to a "flying saucer group."

== The 1980s ==

The Unarius center reached its heyday in the 80s.&lt;ref name=T1995p97&gt;Tumminia, Diana (1995) p97&lt;/ref&gt;

The early eighties brought about the development of a video production studio and the marketing of Unarius videos through [[public-access television]] [[cable TV]] channels all over the nation.&lt;ref&gt;''Unarius Light'', 1983&lt;/ref&gt; From a public relations standpoint, Unarius made big inroads during this period, with new centers being opened up in the United States, Canada and Nigeria. During this period, the public identity of the organization changed from one which was teaching a "metaphysical science of life" to that of a "flying saucer group."

In 1984, Uriel declared Spiegel to have overcome his past negative karma as the Fallen Angel, Satan, and renamed Him Antares. Subsequently, he channeled elements of the millenarian prophecy, including a new planet Myton which would send a spaceship in the year 2001&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2003) p68&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Unarius also held its first annual Interplanetary Confederation Day (later called the Conclave of Light), which commemorates the ‘union of the planets under the guidance of Uriel'.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) p168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tummnia, Diana (1995) p96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saliba, John A. (2003) p198&lt;/ref&gt;

Altogether, Uriel directed the organisation for two decades and published over 80 books.&lt;ref name=S2003p192/&gt;

Uriel broke her hip in 1988&lt;ref name=T2003p69&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2003) p69&lt;/ref&gt; and the next year her health began to slip.&lt;ref name=T1995p97/&gt;

== The 1990s ==
Ruth Norman, after several falls and surgeries in the late eighties, had more limited physical contact with the students and members but said she was "psychically" communicating with them on a day-to-day basis.

Uriel became bedridden, rarely visiting the center herself, and let members know that her work was over. She died in 1993.&lt;ref name=T1995p97/&gt; Her death disconfirmed a long-held prophecy that the landing would take place in her lifetime.&lt;ref name=T2003p69/&gt;  Her will stated that she would return with the Space Brothers in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2003) p72&lt;/ref&gt; Louis Spiegel assumed leadership in the organization.

&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2003) p77&lt;/ref&gt; As director, Spiegel wrote many books on reincarnation and consciousness.  Unlike the Normans, he did not claim to have made ‘psychic/mental voyages’ to other planets. He has been known to claim he's channeling Uriel herself.&lt;ref name=S2003p192/&gt;

After Ruth's death and into the 1990s, some long-term students left over disagreements with Antares. These members wished to return focus to the original teachings of Ernest Norman and the more scientific aspects of Unarius. Some students disputed the importance of Uriel and prophecies concerning her.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2005) p170-171&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiegel died in December 1999, and in 2000, a board of directors formed to guide the center. The board legitimated its cooperative authority through channeled messages, in particular from Uriel and Antares, who are now ‘Space Brothers’.  Channeling ‘explained’ that the Space Brothers are actually guiding the world invisibly and cannot become visible until the world becomes less warlike.  Routinisation of charisma in this organisation thus proceeded smoothly{{clarify|They came up with a standardized procedure for charisma?|date=November 2015}}, 'channelled advice' and the invocation of 'past-life memories' confirming the need for cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Tumminia, Diana (2003) pp77-80&lt;/ref&gt;

Students also left or became home-study students because they disagreed with the channelings of Louis Spiegel, particularly one which claimed that it was time for Ruth, then quite ill but still living, to return to the unseen world. This was in complete opposition to previously expounded Unariun principle, wherein members, no matter how far advanced, ''never'' engaged in interfering with or predicting future human activities. Many Unariuns perceived this as a power-grab against Ruth Norman. In the belief system of the school, this was related to a "negative reliving" of a previous existence, creating false, negative messages.&lt;ref&gt;''Unarius Light'', 1991–1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Norman has been criticized for her flamboyance and costumes worn in later years. Alex Heard, in ''Apocalypse Pretty Soon: Travels In End-Time America'' {{ISBN|0-385-49852-7}}, quipped of her that she was, "a true American original who combined the couture sensibilities of a [[drag queen]] with the ''joie de vivre'' of a [[Frisbee]]-chasing [[Irish Setter]]."

Tumminia stated in the year 2000, that the local public access channels carried weekly showings of Unarian films in several cities in Southern California.&lt;ref name=t2000/&gt;

== 2001 ==
With 2001 having come and gone, and no space fleet landing having occurred, Unarius as an organization demonstrates both a returning to its roots and the principles, books and works of Ernest Norman, while simultaneously demonstrating a belief in a future landing by [[extraterrestrials]] to assist humankind. With the passing of Louis Spiegel in late 1999, the organization has formed a small council which shares leadership and management responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;''Unarius Light'', Online Edition, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Unarius continues to be active both in the US and in several European countries.&lt;ref name=C2006p588/&gt;

According to Zeller, the millennial aspect of Unarius reverted to a more privatised rapture-oriented mIllennialism after the death of Uriel.   He stated that this more individualised approach confirms the quasi-rapture orientation of Ernest Norman.&lt;ref&gt;Zeller Benjamin E. (2009) p326-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of Life Sciences in Poznań''' ({{lang-pl|Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu}}, literally "University of Nature in Poznań") is a higher-education institution in [[Poznań]], [[Poland]]. It officially gained university status on 11 April 2008. Its previous name was ''Akademia Rolnicza im. Augusta Cieszkowskiego w Poznaniu'', literally "[[August Cieszkowski]] Agricultural Academy in Poznań", although it styled itself in English as "The August Cieszkowski Agricultural University of Poznań".

The institution was established in 1951 from Agriculture and Forestry faculties which had existed since 1919 at [[Adam Mickiewicz University]].

The university has faculties of [[Agronomy]], [[Forestry]], [[Animal Breeding]] and [[Biology]], Wood Technology, [[Horticulture]], [[Food Science]] and [[Nutrition]], [[Land reclamation|Land Reclamation]] and [[Environmental Engineering]], and [[Economics]] and [[Social Sciences]].

'''William Dathan Holbert''' (born September 12, 1979), also known as '''Wild Bill''', is a self-confessed [[murderer]] from [[Hendersonville, North Carolina]]. He is currently serving a 47-year sentence for the killings of five Americans in Panama.

Prosecutors allege Holbert, a former associate of the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-potok/national-alliance_b_1694730.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Ten Years After the Founder's Death, Key Neo-Nazi Group a 'Joke' | date=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; confessed to killing five people in [[Panama]] and one person in [[Costa Rica]] to get their money and properties. Prosecutors say Holbert befriended the victims, shot them in the head, buried their bodies, and then stole their homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="nypostjuly16"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Getlen|first1=Larry|title=How a small-time crook became a ruthless killer — with a passion for real estate|url=https://nypost.com/2016/07/10/how-a-small-time-crook-became-a-ruthless-killer-with-a-passion-for-real-estate/|accessdate=28 January 2017|work=New York Post|publisher=NYP HOLDINGS, INC.|date=10 July 2016|ref=nypostjuly16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holbert now operates and chairs "Los Reos Unificados," a syndicated Christian inmate organization, on the national level in the Republic of Panama. Holbert also operates "Panama Human Rights," an international human rights organization for prisoners. In September 2014, Holbert's lawyer issued a statement saying that Holbert had been appointed Chaplain of the Catholic Church in the Public Jail of David; however, the Directorate General for Prisons immediately issued a statement of denial indicating that was not the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.telemetro.com/nacionales/Desmienten-Wild-Bill-designado-capellan_0_731627270.html | title=Desmienten que "Wild Bill" haya sido designado como capellán | publisher=telemetro.com | accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/05/william-holbert-panama-mu_n_671658.html | title=William Holbert Panama Murders: More Bodies Found At Hostel Of U.S. Man Accused Of Serial Killings | publisher=huffingtonpost.com | accessdate=28 March 2014 | first=Nicholas | last=Sabloff | date=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six years after his confession for the killing five people in Panama, the Superior Court of the province of Chiriqui in Panama set a trial date for Dec. 5 2016.&lt;ref name="ctoct16"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Margulis|first1=Abigail |title=Trial date set for confessed serial killer, WNC native  'Wild Bill' |url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/crime/2016/10/21/trial-date-set-serial-killer-and-wnc-native-wild-bill/92505902/|accessdate=28 January 2017|work=Citizen Times|publisher=www.citizen-times.com | date =21 October 2016 |ref=ctoct16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holbert was sentenced to 47 years on the 14th of August 2017 for the killings of the five victims in Panama.

==Media coverage==
''[[Dateline NBC]]'' season 20 episode 7 "Rescue on the Mountainside/Stealing Paradise", original air date October 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2389">The '''Wopkaimin''' are a small [[indigenous people|aboriginal tribe]] that lives in the remote [[Star Mountains]] in western [[Papua New Guinea]] in what is known as the [[Fly River|Fly River socio-ecological region]]. The tribe speaks [[Faiwol language|Faiwol]]. The [[Ok Tedi Mine]], the third largest open pit [[copper]] and [[gold]] [[mining|mine]] in the world is located in their traditional territory.&lt;ref name=GoldMountain&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Sacred Mountain of Gold: The Creation of a Mining Resource Frontier in Papua New Guinea|journal=The Journal of Pacific History|date=December 1994|volume=29|issue=2|pages=203–221|jstor=25169228|author=David Hyndman|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd.|doi=10.1080/00223349408572772}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the coming of the mine with construction starting in 1981 the Wopkaimin lived in a [[subsistence economy]]. The mine severely impacted the tribe, totally disrupting their traditional patterns of life. For one thing, [[Tabubil, Papua New Guinea|Tabubil]] a town of 12,500 to house mine workers was built in the midst of their territory. Work for wages was available to tribal members, but only at the unskilled level and not on a regular basis.  The Wopkaimin along with many other ethnic groups living in the area now live on a rotating basis between the town of Tabubil, roadside villages along the [[Kiunga-Tabubil Highway]], and in villages away from the mine as jobs are lost or become available.

In 1992 a species of [[bat]], [[Bulmer's fruit bat]] (''Aproteles bulmerae'') previously thought extinct was discovered to still live in [[Luplupwintem Cave]], an enormous [[cave]] above the [[Hindenburg Wall]] in their territory. This bat was first discovered in the 1970s by David Hyndman, who studied the Wopkaimin. However the contemporaneous introduction of the [[shotgun]] was thought to have resulted in the [[extinction]] of the species.

'''Yevanic''', also known as '''Judæo-Greek''', '''Romaniyot''',&lt;ref&gt;Spolsky, B., S. B. Benor. 2006. "Jewish Languages." In Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics, 120-124. http://legacy.huc.edu/faculty/faculty/benor/Spolsky%20and%20Benor%20jewish_languages%20offprint.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Romaniote''', and '''Yevanitika''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/3201?hl=es|title=¿Sabías que el Yevanic es una lengua clasificada como|author=|date=|website=Idiomas en peligro de extinción|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Hellenic languages|Greek dialect]] formerly used by the [[Romaniotes]] and by the [[Constantinopolitan Karaites]] (In this case the language is called '''Karaitika''' or '''Karæo-Greek'''&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, P. Jewish and Non-Jewish Creators of "Jewish" Languages, p. 17. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Dalven, R. Judeo-Greek. In: Encyclopedia Judaica. 1971:426&lt;/ref&gt; The Romaniotes are a group of [[History of the Jews in Greece|Greek Jews]] whose presence in [[the Levant]] is documented since the [[Byzantine period]]. Its [[linguistics|linguistic]] lineage stems from the [[Jewish Koine Greek|Jewish Koine]] spoken primarily by [[Hellenistic Jews]] throughout the region, and includes [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] elements. It was mutually intelligible with the Greek dialects of the Christian population. The Romaniotes used the [[Hebrew alphabet]] to write Greek and Yevanic texts. Judaeo-Greek has had in its history different spoken variants depending on different eras, geographical and sociocultural backgrounds. The oldest [[Modern Greek]] text, has been found in the [[Cairo Geniza]] and is actually a Jewish translation of the book [[Ecclesiastes]] (Kohelet).&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Bremer, Susanne Röhl. Language of Religion, Language of the People: Medieval Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, pp. 30-35, Wilhelm Fink Verlag, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Origin of name==
The term ''Yevanic'' is an artificial creation  from the [[Biblical]] word ''Yāwān'' referring to the [[Greeks]] and the lands that the Greeks inhabited. The term is an overextension of the Greek word Ἰωνία ([[Ionia]] in English) from the (then) easternmost Greeks to all Greeks. The word for Greece in [[modern Israeli Hebrew]] is ''Yavan''; likewise, the word ''yevanit'' is used to refer to the modern Greek language in Hebrew.

==Geographical distribution==
A small number of [[Romaniote Jews]] in the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] have small knowledge of the Judaeo-Greek language.
The language is highly endangered and could completely die out. There are no preservation programs to promote or to revive the language.&lt;ref&gt;Vlachou, Evangelia, Papadopoulou, Chrysoula, Kotzoglou, Georgios. Before the flame goes out: documentation of the Yevanic dialect. 2014. Sponsored by the Latsis Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;
There are about 35 speakers left in [[Israel]], the majority are located in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/yej|title=Yevanic|author=|date=|website=ethnologue.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
Greece, Constantinople, Asia Minor, Southern Italy, the Balkans and Eastern Europe had originally a Greek-speaking Jewish community. After the arrival of Jewish refugees into these areas from the Iberian Peninsula, Northern Italy and Western Europe the Greek-speaking Jewish communities began to almost disappear while integrating into the group of the newcomers which did not constituted in every area of their new homeland the majority.&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, Steven (1985). "Language and Literature". The Jews of Byzantium 1204-1453. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: University of Alabama Press. p. 758.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2014/04/01/news-opinion/world/greeces-romaniote-jews-remember-a-catastrophe-and-grapple-with-disappearing|title=Greece’s Romaniote Jews remember a catastrophe and grapple with disappearing - Jewish Telegraphic Agency|author=|date=|website=www.jta.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avigdor Levy; The Jews of the Ottoman Empire, New Jersey, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

The immigration of Italian and Spanish-speaking people into Greece in the late 15th century altered the culture and vernacular of the Greek Jews. A lot locales picked up on Judeo-Spanish language and customs, however some communities in Epirus, Thessaly, the Ionian Islands, Crete, Constantinople and Asia Minor kept the old, so-called "Romaniote minhag" and the Judaeo-Greek language. By the early 20th century, the Jews living in places such as [[Ioannina]], [[Arta (regional unit)|Arta]], [[Preveza]], and [[Chalkida]] still spoke a form of Greek that slightly differentiated the Greek of their Christian neighbors. These differences, semantically, do not go beyond phonetic, intonational, and lexical phenomena. It is different from other Jewish languages, in that there is no knowledge of any language fragmentation ever taking place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewish-languages.org/judeo-greek.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==

The [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the Romaniote communities by the [[Ladino language|Ladino]]-speaking [[Sephardi]] Jews, the [[emigration]] of many of the Romaniotes to the United States and Israel, the murder of many of the Romaniotes during the [[Holocaust]] have been the main reasons of the decline of Judao-Greek. The survivors were too scant to continue an environment in which this language was dominant and more recent generations of the survivors have moved to new locations such as Greece, Israel, and The United States and now speak the respective languages of those countries; [[Standard Modern Greek]], [[Hebrew]], and [[English language|English]]  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projetaladin.org/holocaust/en/a-muslims-guide-to-judaism/jewish-culture/jewish-languages.html|title=Holocaust - Jewish languages|author=|date=|website=www.projetaladin.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonfil, Robert (2011). Jews in Byzantium: Dialectics of Minority and Majority Cultures. Jerusalem Studies in Religion and Culture. Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jews have a place of note in the history of Modern Greek. They were unaffected by [[Atticism]] and employed the current colloquial vernacular which they then transcribed in Hebrew letters. The Romaniotes were Jews settled in the Eastern Roman Empire long before its division from its Western counterpart, and they were linguistically assimilated long before leaving the Levant after [[Hadrian]]'s decree against them and their religion. As a consequence, they spoke Greek, the language of the overwhelming majority of the populace in the beginning of the Byzantine era and that of the Greek élite thereafter, until the fall of the Ottoman Empire. Some communities in Northern Greece and Crete maintained their specific Romaniote practices since these communities were either geographically apart from the Sephardim or had different synagogues, and because their liturgies differed greatly.&lt;ref&gt;Zunz, Leopold "Ritus. 1859. Eine Beschreibung synagogaler Riten".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Luzzato, S. D. Introduction to the Mahzor Bene Roma, p. 34. 1966&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 19th century, the Romaniote community of Greece made an effort to preserve the Romaniote liturgical heritage of Ioannina and Arta, by printing various liturgical texts in the Hebrew printing presses of Salonika.&lt;ref name="Greece p. 40"&gt;The Jewish Museum of Greece, The Jewish Community of Ioannina: The Memory of Artefacts, p. 40 (Booklet). 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
There is a small amount of literature in Yevanic dating from the early part of the modern period, the most extensive document being a translation of the [[Pentateuch]]. A polyglot edition of the [[Bible]] published in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] in 1547 has the Hebrew text in the middle of the page, with a Ladino ([[Judaeo-Spanish]]) translation on one side and a Yevanic translation on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Natalio Fernandez Marcos, ''The Septuagint in Context: Introduction to the Greek Versions of the Bible'' (2000) p 180. The Greek text is published in D. C. Hesseling, ''Les cinq livres de la Loi'' (1897).&lt;/ref&gt;
In its context, this exceptional cultivation of the vernacular has its analogue in the choice of Hellenistic Greek by the translators of the [[Septuagint]] and in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;Lockwood, W. B. 1972. "A Panorama of Indo-European Languages." Hutchinson. London.&lt;/ref&gt;
