'''Proposition 200''', the "Arizona Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act," was an [[Arizona]] state [[initiative]] passed in 2004 that basically requires: (a) persons to provide [[Citizenship in the United States|proof of citizenship]] to register to vote; (b) voters to present a photo identification before receiving a ballot at the polling place; and (c) state and local agencies to verify the identity and eligibility, based on immigration status, of applicants for non-federally mandated public benefits. The proposition also makes it a [[misdemeanor]] for public officials to fail to report violations of [[U.S. immigration law]] by applicants for those public benefits and permits private lawsuits by any resident to enforce its provisions related to public benefits. The requirement to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote was later ruled invalid in federal court.

Authors of the ballot measure, the "Protect Arizona Now" committee, claimed that the provision of state identification and public benefits to individuals without adequately verifying their immigration status gave rise to opportunities for voter fraud and imposed economic hardship on the state.

Opponents of the ballot measure asserted that it was [[nativism (politics)|anti-immigrant]] and reminiscent of [[California]]'s 1994 [[Proposition 187]], as well as disputed the existence of voter fraud and argued that immigrants were important contributors to the state's economy.

==Proponents==
Two separate, rival groups supported Proposition 200. The first group was the proposition's sponsor, the Protect Arizona Now (PAN) committee, led by Kathy McKee and supported at the national level by the Carrying Capacity Network (CCN) and Population-Environment Balance (PEB). The second group was the Yes on 200 committee, led by Rusty Childress, a Phoenix-area car dealer, and supported at the national level by the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] (FAIR).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} There was a split within PAN, which McKee described as an "attempted hijacking of a local effort by greedy, out-of-state interests"; this split highlighted an ongoing feud within the [[immigration reduction]] movement between FAIR and the other two groups dating back to at least 2003, with CCN and PEB issuing frequent statements accusing FAIR (as well as [[NumbersUSA]]) of being "reform lite" and "undermining real immigration reform."{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

PAN was formed by McKee and Childress, who became its chair and treasurer, respectively. The PAN National Advisory Board was chaired by Dr. [[Virginia Abernethy]], and included Dr. [[David Pimentel]] and [[Marvin Gregory]]. Childress later joined a separate effort, Yes On 200, organized by FAIR.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

During the signature gathering campaign, McKee accused Childress of withholding funds and petitions from PAN and fired him.  Childress sued McKee over custody of PAN's signatures and funds, but the court ruled in favor of McKee. Childress and the two most prominent supporters of the initiative within the Arizona state legislature, [[Russell Pearce]] and [[Randy Graf]], then formed a separate organization, Yes On 200, which was funded almost entirely by out-of-state interests.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

When FAIR began an independent signature gathering campaign to collect the remaining signatures needed to put the initiative on the ballot, McKee accused FAIR of attempting a hostile takeover of PAN.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} When McKee named Abernethy, an avowed "ethnic separatist," as the chair of PAN's national advisory board, FAIR responded by issuing a press release calling for both McKee and Abernethy to resign from PAN and saying that Abernethy's views were "repugnant, divisive and do not represent the views of the vast majority of Arizonans who support Proposition 200." Abernethy's appointment drew harsh criticism from an anti-bigotry group based in Chicago, which noted her "leadership roles in other extremist organizations," such as [[The Occidental Quarterly]] and the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/news/article_bb6cb865-a006-5636-915d-89e501942701.html Migrant Foe Tied to Racism], East Valley Tribune (Tempe, AZ), August 16, 2004 (updated October 6, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
On July 5, 2004, Protect Arizona NOW's Chairman, Kathy McKee, pursuant to Arizona law, submitted 190,887 signatures to the [[Arizona Secretary of State]]'s office, surprising critics, who had believed organizers would not be able to garner enough signatures before the deadline.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} A counter-organization, the [[Statue of Liberty Coalition]], was formed to block Proposition 200, claiming the initiative was [[racist]] and would violate [[Latino]] [[civil rights]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Opposition to Proposition 200 was bipartisan, including Senator [[John McCain]] (R), Senator [[Jon Kyl]] (R), Governor [[Janet Napolitano]] (D), the [[Arizona Republican Party]], the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]], the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], and the [[AFL-CIO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://phoenix.about.com/b/2004/08/23/protect-arizona-now.htm About.com Guide: Protect Arizona Now, Judy Hedding, August 23, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Tamar Jacoby]], a writer on immigration-related issues in articles for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby, Tamar. "Flawed proposition". ''The Wall Street Journal'': September 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/12/opinion/oe-jacoby12 Anti-Immigrant Fever in Arizona, Los Angeles Times, July 12, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters partly relied for justification on a 2004 FAIR study that estimated that Arizona taxpayers were annually paying $1 billion to cover the education, uncompensated health care, and incarceration costs of illegal immigration, net of the taxes paid by the illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairus.org/site/DocServer/azcosts2.pdf?docID=101 The Costs of Illegal Immigration to Arizonans], FAIR, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This study appeared to contradict a 2003 study performed by a team at the [[Thunderbird School of Global Management]] and sponsored by [[Wells Fargo]] and the Consul General of Mexico in Phoenix, which estimated that immigrants were annually contributing $318 million more in income and sales taxes than they were costing the state in services and uncompensated health care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derechoshumanosaz.net/images/pdfs/arizona.pdf The Economic Impact of Arizona-Mexico Relationship], Thunderbird School of Global Management, Wells Fargo, and Consul General of Mexico in Phoenix, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not clear whether that estimate was based on all immigrants or only illegal immigrants.

In November 2004, the electorate passed Proposition 200, with 56% of voters voting in the affirmative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/ballot.measures/ CNN.com Election 2004 - Ballot Measures]&lt;/ref&gt; Exit polls found that 47% of Latino voters voted in favor of the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/AZ/I/01/epolls.0.html CNN.com Election 2004 - Ballot Measures / Arizona Proposition 200 / Exit Poll]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
A substantial legal battle erupted over the precise definition of "public benefits." Arizona's [[Attorney General]] ruled that the law pertains to only discretionary state programs. Federally funded entitlements like [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]] and subsidized school lunches are examples of public benefits to which, given the Attorney General's finding, the new law would not apply. PAN interpreted the proposition to apply the welfare portion of the initiative to the nearly 60 programs contained in Arizona Revised Statutes Title 46, "Welfare."

Despite withstanding three pre-election and two post-election lawsuits, at least one lawsuit related to Proposition 200 is still pending. "Yes on 200" filed a post-election lawsuit, initially dismissed in the lower court but currently on appeal, saying that the Attorney General overstepped his bounds when he narrowed the definition of "public benefits."

On December 23, 2004, the federal appeals court in [[Tucson, Arizona]] removed an earlier restraining order that had kept the state from implementing the law. The entire law, with one exception, is in effect, using the definition of "public benefits" promulgated by the Governor and Attorney General. State, county, and city workers may be fined up to $700 for each instance in which they provide such benefits to persons who cannot produce evidence of citizenship.

Kathy McKee has since started a new group, Protect America NOW, to support similar initiatives in other states.

==Voter registration and identification at the polls==
Proposition 200 required, among other things, proof of citizenship to register to vote and voter identification at the polling place. No major elections took place after its adoption before November 7, 2006, and the actual implementation of these two provisions of the proposition remained unclear. Opponents challenged the constitutionality of these requirements upon voters, arguing that such a law could be used to discriminate against ethnic groups, thus violating the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

On October 5, 2006, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] temporarily suspended these requirements, a little over a month before the election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azsos.gov/releases/2006/pressrelease26.htm AZ Secretary of State - Press Release: Sec. of State Brewer Expresses Concern and Alarm over Court Decision] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122202526/http://www.azsos.gov/releases/2006/pressrelease26.htm |date=November 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ruling was stayed fifteen days later by the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azsos.gov/releases/2006/pressrelease29.htm AZ Secretary of State - Press Release: Sec. of State Brewer Gets ID at Polls Reinstated] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122205401/http://www.azsos.gov/releases/2006/pressrelease29.htm |date=November 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Purcell v. Gonzalez]]'', [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/06pdf/06A375.pdf On Applications of Stay], 549 U. S. 1 (October 20, 2006)(U.S. Supreme Court)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, the Ninth Circuit held that the requirement to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote is invalid as [[Federal preemption|preempted]] by the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]] (NVRA) and that the requirement to provide voter identification at the polling place is valid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/files/08-17094-arizonavotercitizenship.pdf ''Gonzales v. Arizona''], No. 08-17094, (9th Cir. Oct. 26, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in April 2011, the court granted Arizona's petition for ''en banc'' review of this ruling, and it heard oral arguments on June 21, 2011.&lt;ref name="en banc review"&gt;[http://www.azag.gov/press_releases/june/2011/citizenship%20to%20vote%206-21-11.html Arizona Attorney General Press Release: "Horne Argues in Favor of Arizona's Law Requiring Proof of Citizenship to Vote"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930142035/http://www.azag.gov/press_releases/june/2011/citizenship%20to%20vote%206-21-11.html |date=September 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the ''en banc'' court also held that the requirement to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote is invalid as preempted by the NVRA and that the requirement to provide voter identification at the polling place is valid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2012/04/17/08-17094.pdf ''Gonzales v. Arizona''], No. 08-17094 (''en banc''), (9th Cir. April 17, 2012) at 4148.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declined to stay the ruling on June 28, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/062812zr.pdf ''Arizona, et al. v. Abeytia, et al.''], No. 11-A-1189 (order), (U.S. Supreme Court, June 28, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Arizona submitted to the Supreme Court a petition for writ of certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's ruling that the state's proof of citizenship requirement is preempted by the NVRA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sblog.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/12-71-Gonzalez-S-Ct-Pet-for-Cert-2012.pdf Arizona v.

Inter Tribal Council, Grant of Petition for Writ of Certiorari] (U.S. Supreme Court, October 15, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and it heard oral arguments on March 18, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/12-71.pdf Arizona, et. al., Petitioners, v. The Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc., Transcript of Oral Argument] (U.S. Supreme Court, March 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; On June 17, 2013, the Supreme Court affirmed, in a 7-2 vote with Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] delivering the Court's opinion, the Ninth Circuit's ruling that Arizona's proof of citizenship requirement is preempted by the NVRA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-71_7l48.pdf ''Arizona v.

The '''American Museum of Tort Law''' is a [[museum]] developed by [[Ralph Nader]], located in his hometown of [[Winsted, Connecticut]]. The museum focuses on topics of civil justice and "aspects of the legal system that handle wrongful actions that result in injury".&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ralph-nader-is-on-track-to-open-a-tort-museum-in-september-1434502337 |title=Buckle Up for Ralph Nader's 'Tort Museum' |accessdate=2015-09-23 |date=2015-06-16 |first=Alison Leigh |last=Cowan |work=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum opened to the public in September 2015.

== Exhibits ==

The museum offers displays regarding the evolution of tort law, precedent setting cases, and cases that made a difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tortmuseum.org/visit |title=Visit |publisher=American Museum of Tort Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eisterhold Associates designed the museum's exhibits. That firm also lent its efforts to a number of museums across the nation, including the [[National Civil Rights Museum]] in Memphis, Tennessee, and the Jurassic Park Discovery Center at [[Universal's Islands of Adventure]] in Orlando, Florida.&lt;ref name="Lambert"/&gt;

== History ==

Originally announced in 1998,&lt;ref name="pinto"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03EEDA1638F93BA15754C0A96E958260 |title=Nader's Museum of Liability: Corvairs, Pintos and Implants |accessdate=2008-04-23 |date=1998-07-28 |first=Jonathan |last=Rabinovitz |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; at an expected cost of $5{{nbsp}}million&lt;ref name="fun"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04EED71038F931A3575BC0A96E958260 |title=A Tort Museum!

The museum planned to include exhibitions on some famous cases including [[Liebeck v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2055">The '''Ancient Monuments Act 1931''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that aimed to improve the protection afforded to ancient monuments in Britain.

==Details==

The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]] had begun the process of establishing legal protection for some of Britain's ancient monuments; these had all been prehistoric sites, such as ancient [[tumulus|tumuli]]. The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900]] had continued this process, empowering the government's Commissioners of Work and local County Councils to protect a wider range of properties. In 1908 a royal commission concluded that there were gaps between these two pieces of legislation, and the [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1910]]. These were felt to be unwieldy, and the Ancient Monuments Act repealed all three in 1913, replacing them with the new Ancient Monuments Board to oversee the protection of such monuments. Powers were given for the Board, with Parliamentary approval, to issue preservation orders and to protect the lands immediately around an ancient monument.&lt;ref&gt;Mynors, pp8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Monuments Act was passed in 1931 to deal with gaps in this system. In particular, the new act extended the definition of an ancient monument to include a cave or an underground archaeological artefact; it also extended the powers of the state to manage development in the area around an ancient monument, allowing them to introduce preservation schemes to protect the wider neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;Mynors, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38707">Humanitarian [[aid workers]] belonging to [[United Nations]] organisations, [[Private voluntary organization|PVO]]s / [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s or the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross / Red Crescent]] have traditionally enjoyed both international legal protection, and ''[[de facto]]'' immunity from attack by belligerent parties. However, '''attacks on humanitarian workers''' have occasionally occurred, and became more frequent since the 1990s and 2000s. In 2012 there were 167 incidents of major violence against aid workers&lt;ref name="aidworkersecurity.org"&gt;https://aidworkersecurity.org/sites/default/files/AidWorkerSecurityReport_2013_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 there were 474 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;http://reliefweb.int/report/world/attacks-humanitarian-aid-workers-five-new-findings&lt;/ref&gt; This is attributed to a number of factors, including the increasing number of humanitarian workers deployed, the increasingly unstable environments in which they work, and the erosion of the perception of neutrality and independence{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. In 2012, road travel was seen to be most dangerous and kidnappings of aid workers have quadrupled in the decade with more aid workers victims of kidnapping than any other form of attack.&lt;ref name="aidworkersecurity.org"/&gt; ICRC promotes a framework for Neutral Independent Humanitarian Action (NIHA) to enable differentiated role understanding.

==Legal basis for protection of humanitarian workers==

The legal basis for protection of humanitarian workers in [[armed conflicts]] is contained in the [[Geneva Conventions]] of 1949 and the related [[Protocol I|Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of 1977. These treaties describe the category of [[civilians]] and outline the rights and obligations of [[non-combatants]] during armed conflicts. These rights include the right to be treated humanely; to have access to food, water, shelter, medical treatment, and communications; to be free from violence to life and person, [[hostage|hostage taking]], and humiliating or degrading treatment; and the prohibition against [[collective punishment]] or [[imprisonment]]. ''Non-combatants'' include citizens and nationals of countries that are not party to the conflict.

While the Geneva Conventions guarantee protection for humanitarian workers, they do not guarantee access of humanitarian workers to affected areas: [[governments]] or [[Military occupation|occupying forces]] may, if they wish, ban a relief agency from working in their area. [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] was created in 1971 with the express purpose of ignoring this restriction, by providing assistance to populations affected by the [[Biafra]]n civil war despite the prohibitions of the government of [[Nigeria]].

In addition, the Geneva Conventions do not require that parties to the conflict guarantee the safety of humanitarian workers. The Conventions prohibit [[combatants]] from attacking non-combatants, and they require occupying forces to maintain general order. However, the Conventions do not require that combating parties provide security escorts, for example, when other factions threaten the safety of non-combatants operating in their area.

In 2003, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1502|Resolution 1502]] giving greater protection to humanitarian workers and treating attacks on them as a [[war crime]].

== Motives ==
The method of targeting foreigners through suicide bombings, IEDs and kidnappings (often closely associated with criminal and political actors) are strong evidence of at least some political motivations against aid workers.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Abby Stoddard, Adele Harmer and Victoria DiDomenico (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3250&amp;title=violence-aid-workers-operational-response-2009 Providing Aid in Insecure Environments: Trends in violence against aid workers and the operational response (2009 Update)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430172646/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=3250&amp;title=violence-aid-workers-operational-response-2009 |date=April 30, 2010 }} [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is very hard often to precisely ascertain a motive; for instance, in 55% of the incidents recorded by the AWSD in 2008, the motive was described as ‘undetermined’.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; However, of those that were determined, political motivations have increased (29% of the determined total in 2003 to 49% in 2008) relative to economic motivations, or when the victim’s status as an aid worker was only incidental.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Afghanistan, as one of the most dangerous countries for humanitarian workers to operate in is influential in this changing dynamic; in 2007 61% of incidents were carried out by criminals and 39% by political opposition groups, but in 2008, 65% of incidents were the work of armed opposition groups.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

Aid workers can be targeted for political reasons both directly and by association.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Sometimes the humanitarian organisation may be targeted for something that it has done or a statement it has made, or simply for the delivery of aid to a population, to whom others do not wish aid to reach.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; It can also be targeted as a result of being associated as an entity collaborating with the 'enemy' (a government, rebel group or foreign power).&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; The dangers of being associated with specific governments or armed forces has further increased the determination of aid workers to be seen as separate, independent and neutral politically.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; However, evidence shows that this has little impact and instead that western aid agencies are perceived as an intrinsic part of the western 'agenda' and not merely associated with it.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; In the case of Afghanistan, with the notable exception of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], it has been surmised that locals no longer make distinctions (as they once did) between organisations, e.g. those were working with the coalition force’s [[Provincial Reconstruction Teams]] and those that did not.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; In remote areas, they sometimes represent the only accessible western target.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; Although empirical studies on aid worker insecurity have been scarce, two have been conducted in Afghanistan. Watts (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Clinton. 2004. [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA467616 Indicators of NGO security in Afghanistan]. West Point: United States Military Academy, The Combating Terrorism Center.&lt;/ref&gt; did not find evidence indicating heightened aid worker insecurity in provinces where the US military was present. Similarly, Mitchell (2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=David | url=http://www.stabilityjournal.org/articles/10.5334/sta.ev/ | title=Blurred Lines? Provincial Reconstruction Teams and NGO Insecurity in Afghanistan, 2010–2011 | journal=Stability: International Journal of Security &amp; Development | last1=Mitchell | year=2015 | volume=4 | issue=1 | pages=1–18 | doi=10.5334/sta.ev | id=Art. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; was unable to discover a relationship between attacks against NGOs and their proximity to the US military or US-led PRTs respectively; however, his study did reveal that aid workers were more likely to encounter a greater number of security incidents in provinces with PRTs not led by the US.

==Trends in risks faced by humanitarian workers==

* Wars between states became much less common in the period following the end of the [[Cold War]]. Unfortunately, these wars have been largely replaced by an increased incidence of internal conflict and resulting violence and miscommunication, increasing the risk to civilians and humanitarian workers alike.
* Between 1985 and 1998 slightly less than 50% of all humanitarian worker deaths came from workers in UN programs. 25% of these deaths were UN peacekeepers.
* Between 2006-2008 Sudan (Darfur), Afghanistan and Somalia – accounted for more than 60% of violent incidents and aid worker victims.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
* Most deaths of aid workers are due to deliberate violence.
* One third of deaths occur in the first three months of deployment, with 17% occurring within the first 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;Sheik, Gutierrez, et al., British Medical Journal 2000;321:166–8&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since 2006, violence is once again on the increase and growth in the number of incidents is faster than the growth in the number of humanitarian aid workers.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
* Kidnapping in particular is on the rise, with a 350% increase between 2006 and 2008.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

Although there were Attorneys General that served the Colony of Sierra Leone, the Office of the Attorney General and Ministry of Justice that still stands today was first established in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ryIyBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq|title=Universal Jurisdiction: The Sierra Leone Profile|last=Thompson|first=Justice Bankole|date=2015-03-12|publisher=Springer|isbn=9789462650541|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would not combine with the Ministry of Justice until 1978 when the country's constitution was amended. The office is responsible for prosecuting all offenses in the name of the Republic of Sierra Leone. The Solicitor General and the Director of Public Prosecutions are two sub-units of the Office of Attorney General and Ministry of Justice.

The '''BC Legislature Raids''' (also known as '''Railgate''' after [[-gate|Watergate]]) resulted from search warrants executed on the [[British Columbia Parliament Buildings|Legislature of British Columbia]], [[Canada]], in 2003 and has become a collective term for the associated criminal proceedings and ensuant controversies. Hearings began in [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|BC Supreme Court]] in April 2007. The proceedings brought to light questions concerning the propriety of the sale of [[BC Rail]] to [[CN Rail]] and the conduct of various government officials and consultants as well as the role of various members of the government, including Premier [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] and his advisers. In October 2010, ministerial aides Dave Basi and Bob Virk pleaded guilty to breach of trust and receiving a benefit for leaking information about the BC Rail bidding process.

==Drug sting "Everywhichway" leads to government aides==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
According to the RCMP, the Raids arose from information uncovered during a drug sting.&lt;ref&gt;CanWest News Service, "Drug link alleged in Basi case," Times Colonist, May 08, 2007, retrieved from [http://www2.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=82eeca7a-4f77-49f4-ad9b-949c6e66795c&amp;k=99781 here on March 30 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neal Hall and Jim Beatty, "B.C.'s Hells Angels," Vancouver Sun, Page A01, September 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the RCMP were monitoring Dave Basi's conversations on his home, government, and cellular phones, as well as his e-mails. At that time the police were focused on breaking up a [[marijuana]] and [[cocaine]] smuggling ring between [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]] run by his cousin [[Jasmohan Singh Bains]].&lt;ref&gt;"Drug dealer linked to legislature raid imprisoned: RCMP oddly silent about key victory against cocaine ring", Ian Mulgrew, ''Vancouver Sun'', February 17, 2008, retrieved here [https://vancouversun.com/news/Drug+dealer+linked+legislature+raid+imprisoned/1297264/story.html on March 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the police investigation of Basi's activities investigators became interested in Basi's dealings as Ministerial Assistant to then Finance Minister [[Gary Farrell-Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Bailey, "Ex-minister wants spy tape released", ''The Province'', A10, February 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A second investigation was launched that had no connection to drug related activities but rather to the [[Influence peddling|sale of benefits]] in regard to the tendering process for the sale of BC Rail.&lt;!--this would be the sale of BC Rail stuff, I'd think, but this is typical of the muzzling of this article: what other kinds of activities?  Influence peddling and "sale of benefits" that's what...--&gt;

On December 28, 2003, a series of search warrants was executed at various locations throughout the [[Lower Mainland]] and in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]. There were four separate applications by the RCMP in 2004 to obtain warrants, and according to the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] these were executed at nine separate premises including the [[British Columbia Parliament Buildings|Parliament Buildings]] in Victoria. As a result, allegations of bribery were made (including money and the offer of potential employment in return for confidential government information).

The sale of BC Rail involved a tax indemnity.  This was structured so that if CN would not have been refunded [[Canadian Dollar|$]]415 million from the Federal Government, then the Province would be required to return this amount to CN.  This had the effect of reducing the sale price of BC Rail from $1.05 billion to under $500 million, thereby in essence short-changing taxpayers more than $550 million.&lt;ref&gt;"A BC Rail time bomb is still ticking for B.C. taxpayers", ''Vancouver Sun'', April 21, 2009, retrieved here [http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=106ef17b-3f69-4946-8132-4ce69f85d065&amp;k=60220]&lt;/ref&gt; (This is in addition to $750 million cash payments and $250 million in direct tax credits, as noted in the section on Patrick Kinsella below.) The BC Rail tax indemnity was taken off the Public Accounts in January 2005, before the May 2005 election, when it was reclassified a contingent liability.

===BC Rail link===

On April 3, 2006, a Justice of the British Columbia Supreme Court ordered the further release of various documents used by police to obtain the search warrants served on individuals linked to the Raids.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/jdb-txt/SC/06/20/2006BCSC2084.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Further charges were laid against two Victoria area developers.

===Agricultural Land Commission &lt;!--and Tsawassen Treaty--&gt;connection===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Basi has also been charged for accepting $50,000 in connection with &lt;!--attempting to negotiate with--&gt; the [[Agricultural Land Reserve|Agricultural Land Commission]]&lt;!-- on removal of land from the Agricultural Land Reserve to benefit a losing bidder in the process, OminTRAX--&gt;.

===Liberal "insiders"===

Several of the people cited by online commentators or certain reporters in the story surrounding the raid are politically active people who had come into contact with Basi. Examples include provincial ministers, staff or officials in the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] or the [[Paul Martin]] leadership campaign.

Search warrants were executed at several locations in addition to the BC Legislature.  The Vancouver home office of Erik Bornmann, the Vancouver home of Bruce Clark (brother of Christy Clark, CKNW 980 talk show host), and the offices of Pilothouse public affairs in Victoria in December 2003.  It has been reported that Erik Bornmann, Brian Kieran and Jamie Elmhirst will testify for the Crown.  The RCMP also attended Ms. Clark's home that she shared with her ex-husband Mark Marissen.&lt;ref&gt;''Vancouver Province'' newspaper&lt;/ref&gt;

The RCMP made it very clear that no elected officials were implicated in their investigation, and also provided a letter to Marissen (Paul Martin's BC Campaign Chair) confirming that he was also not implicated in any way and that they came to his house without a search warrant to seek his help because they thought he might be the "innocent recipient" of emails related to Virk's and Basi's resumes, because it was alleged that they were seeking job recommendations for federal political employment in [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6611281e-d916-4335-a77d-6ca1a05d2a55&lt;/ref&gt; Basi was an active volunteer for the Paul Martin campaign in British Columbia, who recruited many members of the Indo-Canadian community to the Liberal Party to vote in the leadership process. This has led to rampant speculation and innuendo as government critics attempt to link Basi's activities to federal and provincial politicians and operatives, and spread "guilt by association". Part of this speculation is fuelled by comments made to the media at the time of the raids by the officer in charge, that organized crime and corruption were present in "the highest levels of the government".

===Charges laid===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
In December 2004 three men were charged in connection with this investigation and in 2006 two more men were charged.

Those charged include:
*David Basi
*Robert Virk
*Aneal Basi
*Tony Young
*James Duncan

===Legality of warrants===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
Complications in the case included controversy as to whether the police may have misled a judge in the course of obtaining warrants for the investigation which involved eavesdropping on conversations between the [[Premier of British Columbia|Premier]] and the Finance Minister. Twice the warrants were rejected on grounds of privilege, with the third warrant issued without naming the premises, which were the Legislature Buildings.

==Developments in 2009==

===Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act===

The preliminary hearings into eventual criminal court proceedings were kept sealed from the public until opened up in the public's interest, and by requests from defence council, in the fall of 2008 by the presiding justice, [[Elizabeth Bennett (judge)|Elizabeth Bennett]], who struck down the court ban in the grounds of the importance of an open court in regard to the importance of the case to the public interest, contrary to the objections of the government-appointed Special Prosecutor. On February 25, 2009, Judge Bennett released 8000 pages of documents relating to the legislature raids to the New Democrat Official Opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Hume, "Provincial NDP obtain files related to sale of BC Rail", ''Globe and Mail'', February 25, 2009, retrieved from [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090225.wbasi26/BNStory/politics here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents produced attention immediately, first to what appeared to be [[British Columbia Liberal Party|B.C. Liberal Party]] fundraising activities originating from the Finance Minister's office,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Smyth, "NDP stymied in attempt to get Stonewally to open up", ''The Province'', March 3, 2009, retrieved from [https://theprovince.com/Sports/stymied+attempt+Stonewally+open/1347007/story.html here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bcndpcaucus.ca/files/09FOI/Key_documents/kdfundraise.pdf |title=a digital copy of the documents released by Judge Bennett which appears to show partisan fundraising being conducted from the Finance Minister's office |access-date=2009-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320011738/http://www.bcndpcaucus.ca/files/09FOI/Key_documents/kdfundraise.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew MacLeod, "Liberals used government offices for fundraising work", The Tyee, Hook Blog, March 2, 2009 [https://thetyee.ca/Blogs/TheHook/BC-Politics/2009/03/02/LiberalFundraising/ retrieved here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; then to the B.C. Liberal government's strategy for dominating the media discourse and neutralizing question period.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Smyth, "Priceless view that cost us lots", ''The Province'', March 5, 2009, retrieved from [https://theprovince.com/News/Priceless+view+that+cost+lots/1355603/story.html here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Tieleman, "Document urges BC Liberal aides to avoid answers, spin the media", The Tyee, Hook Blog, March 2, 2009, retrieved from [https://thetyee.ca/Blogs/TheHook/BC-Politics/2009/03/02/BC-Liberals-aides-spin-media/ here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Smith, "Premier Gordon Campbell's office: 'It's Question Period, not Answer Period'", ''The Straight'', March 7, 2009, retrieved from [https://www.straight.com/article-205046/bc-premiers-office-its-question-period-not-answer-period here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bcndpcaucus.ca/files/09FOI/Binder_14_Premiers_Office/14-06.pdf |title=a digital copy of the document entitled 'House Review: A Day In The Life' as released by Judge Elizabeth Bennett |access-date=2009-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706170057/http://www.bcndpcaucus.ca/files/09FOI/Binder_14_Premiers_Office/14-06.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, 2009, after raising these two stories the B.C. New Democratic Party caucus released the documents to the public through their website.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford Killian, "NDP posts documents from BC Rail trial", The Tyee, Hook Blog, March 6, 2009, retrieved from [https://thetyee.ca/Blogs/TheHook/BC-Politics/2009/03/06/RailTrial/ here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090310002437/http://www.bcndpcaucus.ca/en/bcrailcorruption way back machine retrieval of the online archive of B.C. Rail Documents released to the New Democrat Caucus]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Kinsella connection===
Shortly after the B.C. New Democratic Caucus won access to the 8000 pages of B.C. rail documents, their researchers uncovered a link between long-time [[British Columbia Liberal Party|B.C. Liberal Party]] insider [[Patrick Kinsella]] &lt;ref&gt;Andrew MacLeod, "Pat Kinsella's Bumpy Career", The Tyee, June 16, 2008, retrieved from [https://thetyee.ca/News/2008/06/16/PatKinsella/ here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and B.C. Rail while looking through public documents available at the legislative library. The documents showed that between 2002 and 2004, B.C. Rail paid $297,000 to the group of companies owned by Kinsella.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn Palmer, "Stonewally to the fore as NDP pounds Kinsella connection", ''Vancouver Sun'', March 12, 2009, retrieved from [https://vancouversun.com/columnists/Stonewally+fore+pounds+Kinsella+connection/1380115/story.html here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovered documents were first aired in question period on Tuesday, March 10, 2009. When questioned by New Democratic Party justice critic, [[Leonard Krog]], about what Kinsella was paid by B.C. Rail to do, the Attorney General, [[Wally Oppal]], claimed that "the issue relating to B.C. Rail is before the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and we will not comment on the matter." &lt;ref&gt;Hansard, Tuesday, March 10, 2009, Afternoon, Vol. 39, No. 11, oral question period, ROLE OF PATRICK KINSELLA IN B.C. RAIL SALE, retrieved from [http://www.leg.bc.ca/hansard/38th5th/H90310p.htm here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsella's company, the Progressive Group, issued a statement claiming that Kinsella "was engaged by BC Rail to assist in understanding and interpreting the Core Review Process as to its potential impact on the Corporation", while on B.C. Rail's payroll.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Fowlie and Neal Hall, "Judge raises Kinsella lobbying in Basi-Virk case", ''Vancouver Sun'', March 13, 2009, retrieved from [https://vancouversun.com/news/Judge+raises+Kinsella+lobbying+Basi+Virk+case/1384615/story.html here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Questioned outside of the legislature Oppal said that he had no idea if Kinsella's activities were connected to the B.C. Rail trial.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay Kines, "B.C. Liberals silent on payments to party official", ''Times Colonist'', March 12, 2009, retrieved from [http://www.timescolonist.com/Liberals+silent+payments+party+official/1380978/story.html here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
Soon after, a defence lawyer involved in the trial alleged that Kinsella was working for both CN Rail and BC Rail in the time before the $1-billion sale of BC Rail to CN was finalized.&lt;ref&gt;Neal Hall and Johnathan Fowlie, "Kinsella worked for both sides, lawyer says", ''Vancouver Sun'', March 27, retrieved from [http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=29986828-6c14-4b9e-a1f9-aecb43f1b87b here on March 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsella wrote the B.C. Liberal Party election platform for the 2003 and 2005 elections.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Fowlie, "A quiet titan finds an uncomfortable limelight" , ''Vancouver SunMarch 16, 2009, retrieved from [https://vancouversun.com/news/quiet+titan+finds+uncomfortable+limelight/1394234/story.html here on April 2, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsella's involvement in the political corruption trial &lt;ref&gt;Mark Hume and Justine Hunter, "Campbell's ally in spotlight at corruption trial", ''Globe and Mail'', March 27, 2009, retrieved from [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20090327.BCBASI27/TPStory/National here on April 2, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; has led observers to draw a link between the B.C. rail scandal &lt;ref&gt;Gary Mason, "Whiff of scandal envelops sale of BC Rail", ''Globe and Mail'', March 26, retrieved from [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090326.wbcmason26/BNStory/Front here on April 2, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Mason, ''Globe and Mail'', "Premier faces questions, and voters need answers, about sale of BC Rail", Page A10, March 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gary Mason, "As election looms, new revelations about BC Rail stir up waters", ''Globe and Mail'', March 28, 2009, retrieved from [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090328.wbcmason28/BNStory/politics/home here on April 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaughn Palmer, "Campbell's BC Rail deal just can't shake whiff of scandal", ''Vancouver Sun'', March 14, 2009, retrieved from [http://www2.canada.com/vancouversun/columnists/story.html?id=e6153f49-fa40-4b39-81b1-774b47f32070 here on April 2, 2009] relevant quote "Campbell, Kinsella in BC Rail tryst".&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an email cited by defense lawyer Kevin McCullough, Kinsella may have interceded with Premier Gordon Campbell's chief of staff to keep the sale of B.C. rail to C.N. from "going off the tracks." &lt;ref&gt;Keith Fraser, "Liberal insider accused of double-dealing 'sham'", Page A12, ''The Province'', March 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsella is alleged to have been involved in entering the $505 million BC Rail tax indemnity (refund) on the books at 255 million.  

The sale of BC Rail included a $505 million BC Rail tax indemnity on top of $750 million cash and $250 million in direct tax credits.  Under the terms of the indemnity, if CN would not have been refunded the amount of the indemnity from the Federal Government, then the Province would be required to return this amount.  This reduced the sale price of BC Rail from $1.05 billion to roughly $500 million, thereby benefiting private shareholders of CN, albeit at the expense of the public at large. The BC Rail tax indemnity was taken off the Public Accounts in January 2005, before the May 2005 election, when it was reclassified a contingent liability.  

The BC Rail sale Annual Report was defective and did not cite the indemnity, and recorded these tax credits at zero [[book value]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://vancouversun.com/Rail+time+bomb+still+ticking+taxpayers/1517685/story.html "A BC Rail time bomb is still ticking for B.C. taxpayers: Campbell Liberals left us on the hook for half a billion", Vaughn Palmer, ''Vancouver Sun'', April 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BREEAM''' ('''Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method'''), first published by the [[Building Research Establishment]] (BRE) in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BREEAM: What is BREEAM?|url=http://www.breeam.org/about.jsp?id=66|publisher=Building Research Establishment|accessdate=8 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194348/http://www.breeam.org/about.jsp?id=66|archive-date=2015-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the world's longest established method of assessing, rating, and certifying the [[Sustainable development|sustainability]] of buildings.  More than 250,000 buildings have been BREEAM-certified and over a million are registered for certification – in more than 50 countries worldwide. BREEAM also has a tool which focuses on neighborhood development. 

==Purpose==
'''BREEAM''' is an assessment using scientifically based [[Sustainability metrics and indices]] that covers a range of environmental issues. Its categories evaluate energy and water use, health and wellbeing, pollution, transport, materials, waste, ecology and management processes. Buildings are rated and certified on a scale of 'Pass', 'Good', 'Very Good', 'Excellent' and 'Outstanding'.  It is carried out by independent, licensed assessors.

It works to raise awareness amongst owners, occupiers and designers of the benefits of taking a sustainability approach. It helps them to successfully adopt sustainable solutions in a cost effective manner, and provides market recognition of their achievements. It aims to reduce the negative effects of construction and development on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lowe, Watts|first=Jack, Norman|year=2011|title=An Evaluation of A BREEAM Case Study Project|url=http://shura.shu.ac.uk/7585/1/2011_3(1)_watts.pdf|journal=Sheffield Hallam University Built Environment Research Transaction|volume=|pages=42-53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Work on creating BREEAM began at the [[Building Research Establishment]] (based in [[Watford]], [[England]], [[UK]]) in 1988. The first version for assessing new office buildings was launched in 1990. This was followed by versions for other buildings including superstores, industrial units and existing offices.

In 1998 there was a major revamp of the '''BREEAM Offices standard''', and the scheme's layout, with features such as weighting for different sustainability issues, was established. The development of BREEAM then accelerated with annual updates and variations for other building types such as retail premises being introduced.

A version of BREEAM for new homes called [[EcoHomes]] was launched in 2000. This scheme was later used as the basis of the [[Code for Sustainable Homes]], which was developed by BRE for the UK Government in 2006/7 and replaced EcoHomes in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. In 2014, the Government in England signalled the winding down the Code for Sustainable homes, since then BRE has developed the Home Quality Mark which is part of the BREEAM family of schemes. 

An extensive update of all BREEAM schemes in 2008 resulted in the introduction of mandatory post-construction reviews, minimum standards and innovation credits. International versions of BREEAM were also launched that year.

Another major update in 2011 resulted in the launch of BREEAM New Construction, which is now used to assess and certify all new UK buildings. This revision included the reclassification and consolidation of issues and criteria to further streamline the BREEAM process. The latest update of BREEAM UK New Construction was launched in March 2018 at [[Ecobuild]].

==Scope==
BREEAM has expanded from its original focus on individual new buildings at the construction stage to encompass the whole life cycle of buildings from planning to in-use and refurbishment. Its regular revisions and updates are driven by the ongoing need to improve sustainability, respond to feedback from industry and support the UK's sustainability strategies and commitments.

Highly flexible, the BREEAM standard can be applied to virtually any building and location, with versions for new buildings, existing buildings, refurbishment projects and large developments:

'''BREEAM New Construction''' is the BREEAM standard against which the sustainability of new, non-residential buildings in the UK is assessed. Developers and their project teams use the scheme at key stages in the design and procurement process to measure, evaluate, improve and reflect the performance of their buildings.

'''BREEAM International New Construction''' is the BREEAM standard for assessing the sustainability of new residential and non-residential buildings in countries around the world, except for the UK and other countries with a national BREEAM scheme (see below). This scheme makes use of assessment criteria that take account of the circumstances, priorities, codes and standards of the country or region in which the development is located.

'''BREEAM In-Use''' is a scheme to help building managers reduce the running costs and improve the environmental performance of existing buildings. It has three parts – Parts 1 (building asset) and 2 (building management) are relevant to all non-domestic, commercial, industrial, retail and institutional buildings. Part 3 (occupier management) of the BREEAM In-Use certification scheme is currently restricted to offices. BREEAM In-Use is widely used by members of the International Sustainability Alliance (ISA) which provides a platform for certification against the scheme.

'''BREEAM Refurbishment''' provides a design and assessment method for sustainable housing refurbishment projects, helping to cost effectively improve the sustainability and environmental performance of existing dwellings in a robust way.
A scheme for non-housing refurbishment projects is being developed and is targeted for launch in early 2014. The launch date will be announced once the piloting and independent peer review processes has been completed.

'''BREEAM Communities''' focusses on the [[Urban planning|masterplanning]] of whole communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharifi|first=Ayyoob|author2=Akito Murayama|title=Neighborhood Sustainability Assessment in Action: Cross-Evaluation of Three Assessment Systems and Their Cases from the US, the UK, and Japan|journal=Building and Environment|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.11.006|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sharifi|first=Ayyoob|author2=Murayama, Akito|title=Viability of using global standards for neighbourhood sustainability assessment: insights from a comparative case study|journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management|date=28 January 2014|pages=1–23|doi=10.1080/09640568.2013.866077}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is aimed at helping construction industry professionals to design places that people want to live and work in, are good for the environment and are economically successful.

BREEAM includes several sustainability categories for the assessment, generally

* Management
* Energy
* Health &amp; wellbeing
* Transport
* Water
* Materials
* Waste
* Land use and ecology
* Pollution

Home Quality Mark was launched in 2015 as part of the BREEAM family of schemes. It rates new homes on their overall quality and sustainability, then provides further indicators on the homes impact upon the occupants 'Running costs', 'Health and wellbeing' and 'Environmental footprint'.

==National Operators==
BREEAM is used in more than 70 countries, with several in Europe having gone a stage further to develop country-specific BREEAM schemes operated by National Scheme Operators (NSOs). There are currently NSOs affiliated to BREEAM in:

*''' [[Netherlands]]''' – the Dutch Green Building Council operates BREEAM NL
*'''[[Spain]]''' – the Instituto Tecnológico de Galicia operates BREEAM ES [http://www.breeam.es www.breeam.es]
*'''[[Norway]]''' – the Norwegian Green Building Council operates BREEAM NOR
*'''[[Sweden]]''' – the Swedish Green Building Council operates BREEAM SE
*'''[[Germany]]''' – the German Institute for Sustainable Real Estate (DIFNI) is operating BREEAM DE.

Schemes developed by NSOs can take any format as long as they comply with a set of overarching requirements laid down in the Code for a Sustainable Built Environment. They can be produced from scratch by adapting current BREEAM schemes to the local context, or by developing existing local schemes.

==The cost and value of sustainability==
A growing body of research evidence is challenging the perception, still held by many, that sustainable buildings are significantly more costly to design and build than those that simply adhere to regulatory requirements. Research by the [[Sweett Group]]&lt;ref&gt;Sweett Group, BRE. Putting a price on sustainability – an update. IHS BRE Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; into projects using BREEAM, for example, demonstrates that sustainable options often add little or no capital cost to a development project. Where such measures do incur additional costs, these can frequently be paid back through lower running expenses, ultimately leading to saving over the life of the building.

Research studies have also highlighted the enhanced value and quality of sustainable buildings. Achieving the standards required by BREEAM requires careful planning, design, specification and detailing, and a good working relationship between the client and project team – the very qualities that can produce better buildings and better conditions for building users.&lt;ref&gt;Yates A. Sustainable Buildings : benefits for occupiers/designers/investors and developers/constructors. BRE IP 13/03 Parts 1-4. BRE Bookshop, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; A survey commissioned by [[Schneider Electric]] and undertaken by [[BSRIA]]&lt;ref&gt;BSRIA in association with Schneider Electric. The Value of BREEAM. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; examined the experiences of a wide range of companies that had used BREEAM. The findings included, for example, that 88% think it is a good thing, 96% would use the scheme again and 88% would recommend BREEAM to others.

The greater efficiency and quality associated with sustainability are also helping to make such building more commercially successful. There is growing evidence, for example, that BREEAM-rated buildings provide increased rates of return for investors, and increased rental rates and sales premiums for developers and owners. A [[Maastricht University]] document, published by [[RICS]] Research,&lt;ref&gt;Chegut A, Eicholtz P, Kok N. Supply, Demand and the Value of Green Buildings. Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; reported on a study of the effect of BREEAM certification on office buildings in London from 2000–2009. It found, for example, that these buildings achieved a 21% premium on transaction prices and an 18% premium on rents.

'''''Black and White Taxicab and Transfer Company v. Brown and Yellow Taxicab and Transfer Company''''', 276 U.S. 518 (1928), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court refused to hold that federal courts sitting in [[diversity jurisdiction]] must apply [[U.S. state|state]]  [[common law]].  Ten years later, in ''[[Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins]]'', the Court reversed course, and overturned ''[[Swift v. Tyson]]''.

It is most famous for the dissent of Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]].

==Case details==
Brown and Yellow Cab Company, a Kentucky corporation, sought to create a business association with the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]], where Brown and Yellow would have a monopoly on soliciting passengers of the [[The Historic Railpark and Train Museum|railroad station]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]], effectively eliminating the competition, the Black and White Cab Co. Such an agreement was illegal under Kentucky common law, as interpreted by Kentucky's highest court. Brown and Yellow dissolved itself, reincorporated in Tennessee, and executed the agreement there, where such an agreement was legal, bringing suit against Black and White in a Kentucky federal court to prevent them from soliciting passengers. The federal court upheld the agreement, citing Swift, and arguing that under general federal common law, the agreement was valid

'''Brazil Can Do More''' ({{lang-pt|O Brasil pode mais}}), renamed '''Change Brazil''' ({{lang-pt|Muda Brasil}}) as of 2014, is a [[Centrism|centrist]] electoral coalition in [[Brazil]] formed around the centrist [[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB) for the [[Brazilian presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election]]. It is formed by six parties: PSDB, [[Democrats (Brazil)|Democrats]] (DEM), [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|Brazilian Labour Party]] (PTB), [[Socialist People's Party (Brazil)|Socialist People's Party]] (PPS), [[Party of National Mobilization]] (PMN) and [[Avante (political party)|Labour Party of Brazil]] (PTdoB). Its presidential candidate is former [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] Governor [[José Serra]] from PSDB and the vice-presidential candidate is [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] federal deputy [[Indio da Costa]] from DEM.

On October 3, Serra was the second top voted candidate at the presidential election. Because the top voted candidate, [[Dilma Rousseff]], was not able to get 50% of the unspoilt votes, she faced Serra in a run-off on October 31, which Rouseff won.

At the [[Brazilian legislative election, 2010|legislative election]], the Brazil Can Do More coalition gained 136 out of 513 seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/especiais/eleicoes-2010/noticia/2010/10/saiba-nova-composicao-da-camara.html G1 – Saiba a nova composição da Câmara – notícias em Eleições 2010].

Noticias.r7.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-31.&lt;/ref&gt; This result was an all-time low for the [[Lulism|lulist]] opposition. On the other hand, the [[Centre-left politics|center-left]] [[With the Strength of the People|For Brazil to Keep on Changing]] coalition, which gathered around Lula's chosen successor Dilma Rousseff, reached an all-time high.

For the [[Brazilian general election, 2014|2014 elections]], the alliance changed its name to Change Brazil ({{lang-pt|Muda Brasil}}) and was led by [[Aécio Neves]].

[[File:C3s logo.png|thumb|200px|Logo of the C3S]]
The '''Cultural Commons Collecting Society SCE mbH''', abbreviated as '''C3S''' is a [[European Cooperative Society]] which aims to create a [[Collecting Society]] for music.

The project is currently coordinated and operated by ''OpenMusicContest.org'', a Düsseldorf-based association which considered it necessary to create a Collecting Society that would compete with [[Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte|GEMA]] which currently holds a monopoly on music licensing. C3S aims to be different from GEMA: All C3S members are allowed to vote in the members' assembly and will be able to choose which of their works they want to have handled by C3S and under which licenses. Accounting is intended to be fully automated.

Initial funding for the project came from a crowd funding campaign that yielded 119,000 €. The project also got a positive rating at the "Digitales Medienland NRW" innovation competition. As a result of this, C3S will receive 200,000 € of government funds from the state of Northrine-Westphalia if they manage to collect another 200,000 € themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrw.de/landesregierung/initiative-digitales-medienland-nrw-nrw-foerdert-innovative-digitalprojekte-14685/ Initiative Digitales Medienland NRW] on ''nrw.de''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2013, C3S was founded as a [[European Cooperative Society]] in Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.c3s.cc/grundung-der-gema-alternative-c3s-hamburg/ Gründung der GEMA-Alternative C3S in Hamburg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214057/http://blog.c3s.cc/grundung-der-gema-alternative-c3s-hamburg/ |date=4 October 2013 }} on blog.c3s.cc&lt;/ref&gt; C3S plans to file a license application with the [[Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt|German Patent and Trademark Office]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/medien/gema-alternative-c3s-legaler-tausch-schliesst-profit-nicht-aus-12578461.html Legaler Tausch schließt Profit nicht aus] on [[FAZ.NET]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Danish nationality law''' is ruled by the [[Constitution of Denmark|Constitutional act of Denmark]] (of 1953) and the Consolidated Act of Danish Nationality (of 2003, with amendment in 2004).
[[Kingdom of Denmark|Danish]] [[nationality]] can be acquired in one of the following ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bekendtgørelse af lov om dansk indfødsret|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/r0710.aspx?id=28974}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Automatically at [[birth]] if born in the [[Danish Realm|Kingdom of Denmark]] and at least one of the parents has Danish citizenship.
*Automatically at birth if born outside the Kingdom of Denmark and at least one of the parents has Danish citizenship. 
*Automatically if a person is [[adoption|adopted]] as a child under 12 years of age
*By declaration for nationals of another [[Nordic countries|Nordic country]]
*By [[Naturalization|naturalisation]], that is, by statute
*Automatically at birth if either parent is a Danish citizen, [[Jus sanguinis|regardless of birthplace]], if the child was born on or after July 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automatisk erhvervelse af dansk statsborgerskab|url=http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/arbejdsomr%C3%A5der/statsborgerskab/danske-statsborgere/automatisk-erhvervelse-af-dansk-statsborgerskab|website=Justitsministeriet (Danish Ministry of Justice)|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Danish nationality can be lost in one of the following ways==
*Automatically if a person acquired Danish nationality by birth, but was not born in the Kingdom of Denmark and has never lived in the Kingdom of Denmark by the age of 22 years (unless this would render the person [[Stateless person|stateless]] or the person has lived in another Nordic country for an aggregate period of no less than 7 years)
*By [[court order]] if a person acquired his or her Danish nationality by fraudulent conduct (E.g：[[Sham marriage]])

*By court order if a person is convicted of violation of one or more provisions of Parts 12 and 13 of the Danish Criminal Code (crimes against national security), unless this would render the person stateless
*By voluntary application to the [[Minister for Refugee, Immigration and Integration Affairs]] (a person who is or who desires to become a national of a foreign country may be released from his or her Danish nationality by such an application)

==Naturalisation as a Danish citizen==
* One must have permanent residence status in the Kingdom of Denmark in order to become a citizen.
* 9 years of continuous residence, with restricted allowance for interrupted residence of up to 1 year or 2 years in special circumstances (education, family illness). Continuous residence is not clearly defined, but one must state periods of absence from the Kingdom of Denmark longer than 14 days.
* 8 years of continuous residence for people who are stateless or with refugee status
* Each year of marriage to a Danish citizen reduces the requirement by one year, to a maximum reduction of 3 years. For example, as little as 6 years of continuous uninterrupted residence for people who have been married to Danish nationals for 3 years. One year of cohabitation before marriage counts as a year of marriage for this purpose. {{confusing|date=January 2018}}
* There is a special and little mentioned clause which allows for absences from the Kingdom of Denmark of longer than 1 or 2 years if one is married to a Danish citizen. The total period of continuous residence should be at least 3 years and it must exceed the total periods of absence, AND either: the period of marriage being at least 2 years or the total period of residence in the Kingdom of Denmark being 10 years less the period of marriage and 1 year for cohabitation before marriage). One must still have permanent residence.{{clarify|date=February 2012}}
* If one is married to a Dane working 'for Danish interests' in a foreign country, then this period of absence from the Kingdom of Denmark can be regarded as residence in the Kingdom of Denmark.

According to [[Statistics Denmark]], 3,267 [[Alien (law)|foreigners]] living in Denmark replaced their foreign [[citizenship]] with Danish citizenship in 2012. A total of 71.4% of all those who were naturalized in 2012 were from the [[Western world|non-Western world]]. Half of all new Danish citizenships in 2012 were given to people from [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Somalia]] and [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectOut/PxSort.asp?file=2013102623517129625246DKSTAT&amp;PLanguage=0&amp;MainTable=DKSTAT&amp;MainTablePrestext=Personer,%20der%20har%20skiftet%20til%20dansk%20statsborgerskab&amp;potsize=233 "Personer, der har skiftet til dansk statsborgerskab" (= "People who have changed to Danish citizenship"), Danmarks Statistik (= Statistics Denmark), 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual citizenship==
In October 2011, the newly elected centre-left coalition government indicated its intention to permit [[dual citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;Bramsen, C.B. [http://politiken.dk/debat/kroniker/ECE1412805/danskere-i-udlandet-har-ogsaa-rettigheder/ Danskere i udlandet har også rettigheder] (in Danish). Politiken.dk. Retrieved 2011-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rgOct2011&gt;{{cite journal|title=regeringsgrundlag (oct. 2011) |date=October 2011 |url=http://www.stm.dk/publikationer/Et_Danmark_der_staar_sammen_11/Regeringsgrundlag_okt_2011.pdf |accessdate=8 July 2012 |author=Regeringen |pages=54–55 |location=Denmark |language=Danish |quote=Danmark er et moderne samfund i en international verden.

On December 18, 2014, Parliament passed a bill to allow Danish citizens to become foreign nationals without losing their Danish citizenship, and to allow foreign nationals to acquire Danish citizenship without renouncing their prior citizenship. A provision in the bill also allows former Danish nationals who lost their citizenship as a result of accepting another to reobtain Danish citizenship. This provision expires in 2020. A separate provision, lasting until 2017, allows current applicants for Danish citizenship who have been approved under the condition they renounce their prior citizenship to retain their prior nationality as they become Danish citizens. The law came into force on September 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Folketinget - L 44 - 2014-15 (oversigt): Forslag til lov om ændring af lov om dansk indfødsret. (Accept af dobbelt statsborgerskab og betaling af gebyr i sager om dansk indfødsret).|url=http://www.ft.dk/samling/20141/lovforslag/L44/index.htm|website=Folketinget|publisher=Parliament of Denmark|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anyone with Danish (or other) citizenship may be required by a country of which they are also citizens to [[Multiple citizenship#Complex laws on dual citizenship|give up their other (Danish) citizenship]], although this cannot be enforced outside the jurisdiction of the country in question. For example [[Japanese nationality law#Dual nationality|Japan does not permit multiple citizenship]], while [[Argentine nationality law#Dual citizenship|Argentina has no restrictions]].

==Citizenship of the European Union==
[[Citizenship of the European Union]] for Danish citizens varies in each part of the [[Danish Realm]].

Danish citizens in Denmark proper are also citizens of the [[European Union]] under [[European Union law]] and thus enjoy [[Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states|rights of free movement]] and [[Denmark (European Parliament constituency)|have the right to vote]] in [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/denmark/index_en.htm | title=Denmark | publisher=European Union | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in a non-EU country where there is no Danish embassy, Danish citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Stated_rights|Rights abroad: Right to consular protection]]: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). [[Antigua and Barbuda]] (UK), [[Barbados]] (UK), [[Belize]] (UK), [[Central African Republic]] (France), [[Comoros]] (France), [[Gambia]] (UK), [[Guyana]] (UK), [[Liberia]] (Germany), [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] (UK), [[San Marino]] (Italy), [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] (Portugal), [[Solomon Islands]] (UK), [[Timor-Leste]] (Portugal), [[Vanuatu]] (France)&lt;/ref&gt; Danish citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in [[Treaties of the European Union|Article 21 of the EU Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF |format=PDF|title=Treaty on the Function of the European Union  (consolidated version)|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenland]] joined the [[European Economic Community]] along with Denmark proper in 1973 but left in 1985. Although Greenland is not part of the EU, Danish citizens residing in Greenland are EU citizens.

The [[Faroe Islands]] have never been part of the EU or its predecessors, and [[Treaties of the European Union|EU treaties]] do not apply to the islands. Consequently, Danish citizens residing in the Faroe Islands are not EU citizens within the meaning of the treaties. However, they can choose between a non-EU [[Danish passport|Danish-Faroese passport]] (which is green and modelled on pre-EU Danish passport) or a regular Danish EU passport. Some EU member states may treat Danish citizens residing in the Faroe Islands the same as other Danish citizens and thus as EU citizens.

Concerning citizenship of the European Union as established in the [[Maastricht Treaty]], Denmark proper obtained an opt-out in the [[Edinburgh Agreement (1992)|Edinburgh Agreement]], in which EU citizenship does not replace national citizenship and each member state is free to determine its nationals according to its own nationality law. The [[Amsterdam Treaty]] extends this to all EU member states, which renders the Danish opt-out ''de facto'' meaningless.

==Travel freedom of Danish citizens==

{{Main|Visa requirements for Danish citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Danish citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for Danish citizens]]]]
Visa requirements for Danish citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]]. In May 2018, Danish citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 185 countries and territories, ranking the Danish passport 5th in the world according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Henley visa restrictions index]].

The Danish nationality is ranked fourth in [[The Quality of Nationality Index]] (QNI). This index differs from the [[Henley Passport Index]], which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, besides travel freedom, internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development as well.

'''''Devine v Quebec (AG)'''''{{ref|name}}, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 790 is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on the constitutional protection of [[minority language]] rights.

==Background==
[[Allan Singer]] was a Montreal printer who mostly served anglophone clientele. For over 30 years, his store front had a sign advertising his store that was written in English only. He was charged under the ''[[Charter of the French Language]]'' for having an English sign.

Singer and several others brought an action to strike down provisions of the French Language Charter and the ''Regulation respecting the language of commerce and business'', which required commercial signs to be in French only, as being laws that were ''[[ultra vires]]'' the province, and in violation of his freedom of expression under section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter and section 3 of the Quebec Charter, right to equality under 15(1) of the Canadian Charter, and his right against discrimination under section 10 of the Quebec Charter.

==Issues==
The issues before the Supreme Court were:
# whether the Language Charter was valid provincial law
# whether the provisions prohibiting English signs violated the right to freedom of expression under [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2(b)]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Canadian Charter]]''
# and if so, could it be saved under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]] of the ''Canadian Charter''.

==Judgment of the Court==
In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court held that the Language Charter concerned a valid provincial matter but it violated Singer's freedom of expression under section 2(b) of the ''Canadian Charter'' as it prohibited the use of English.

The Court rejected Singer's argument that the law restricted mobility as protected under the Charter. The law only established conditions for doing business but did not restrict anyone's comings or goings.

On the federalism issue, the Court rejected Singer's argument that the law constituted [[Criminal law under the Constitution Act, 1867]]. Though there was a prohibition and a penalty, the Act as a whole it constituted a regulatory scheme directed as the linguistic mode of certain commercial activities, and did not resemble any traditional criminal matters based on morality or public order.

The '''Doctor of Public Administration''' ('''D.P.A.''') is a terminal applied-research doctoral degree in the field of [[public administration]] (government), which is a sub-discipline of [[political science]]. The D.P.A. requires significant coursework beyond the masters level and a [[dissertation]] that contributes to theory or practice. Upon successful completion, the title of "Doctor" is awarded and the post-nominal letters of D.P.A. or DPA can be used.

==Overview==
Like a Ph.D., a D.P.A. is normally a terminal research degree. The [[U.S. Department of Education]] and the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) recognize the D.P.A. as an academically equivalent degree to the more common Ph.D. and they do not discriminate between the two degrees.

In many cases, D.P.A. programs are identical to Ph.D. programs. Additionally, the D.P.A. dissertation is usually at the same level as a Ph.D. in terms of effort, rigor, contribution to knowledge, supervision and assessment. A study published by the [[National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration]] titled ''What's in a Name? Comparing DPA and Ph.D. Programs'' concluded that there was "few differences between the programs, noting that degree title is more informative about the type of students recruited than outputs"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

D.P.A. research is both theoretical and practical, but the research focus of the typical D.P.A. addresses applied issues, with the results providing professional outcomes that are of direct relevance to practice. While also intended to prepare graduates for academic careers, the D.P.A., by virtue of its focus on application of theory, has more practical application in managerial settings than the Ph.D. degree. Most D.P.A. graduates lead careers as senior-level practitioners, while others enter academia. This is similar to other professional research doctorates such as the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) and Doctor of Education (Ed.D).

A Ph.D. is more concentrated on developing theory and conducting specialized scholarly research.  This degree is more appropriate for people who wish to become professional researchers, or who wish to pursue a career in academia. Most Ph.D. graduates lead careers as university researchers and professors or as senior researchers in business or government.

== Purpose ==
The Doctor of Public Administration program is designed to provide senior-level public managers, or quasi-public managers, with the substantive skills, knowledge and values necessary in this area. Students in most programs develop a thorough knowledge of the legal, ethical and political environments of public administrators. Students understand the administrative functions of governmental agencies and gain expertise in strategic planning, advanced management techniques, program implementation and results-based leadership.

The official policy of [[Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration]] (NASPAA) is that the doctorate is a research degree, regardless of degree title. Its "Policy on Doctoral Education in Public Affairs/Public Administration" (1983,1987,1) states that: "Doctoral programs in public administration...should prepare students to undertake significant research in their subsequent careers, whether in government, academic life, or other settings; the capacity to do significant research, rather than access to a particular career setting, is the appropriate goal of doctoral training."

== Structure of programs ==
Most D.P.A. programs require about 90 credit hours of combined graduate coursework. Students are expected to take a number of core classes, electives, research/method classes, and dissertation credits. Some programs also require comprehensive examinations. All programs require a doctoral dissertation that contributes to knowledge. Candidates typically work with a committee and advisors throughout the process and the dissertation eventually requires an oral defense to the student's committee. Curricula may be offered on a full-time or part-time basis. The normal duration of a doctorate should correspond to 3–5 years of full-time graduate study or 7–10 years of sustained part-time graduate study.

The D.P.A. is preceded by a master's degree, typically the [[Master of Public Administration]] or the [[Master of Public Policy]]. D.P.A. programs are most common in the United States and the Philippines. The D.P.A. degree may have a specialization such as [[management science]], [[organizational behavior]], implementation, [[non-profit management]], [[public finance]], [[national security]], [[defense policy]], [[education policy]], [[environmental policy]], [[international trade]] and [[immigration]], policy making, [[Policy analysis|policy evaluation]], program evaluation, [[criminal justice]], [[civil rights]], health and welfare, [[federalism]], [[strategic management]], [[public health]], [[administrative law]], [[social welfare]], [[tax policy]], government-business relations, [[economic policy]], and [[public management]].

A '''harmless error''' is a ruling by a [[trial]] [[judge]] that, although mistaken, does not meet the burden for a losing party to reverse the original decision of the trier of fact on [[appeal]], or to warrant a new trial.  Harmless error is easiest to understand in an [[Evidence (law)|evidentiary]] context.  Evidentiary errors are subject to harmless error analysis, under [[Federal Rule of Evidence]] 103(a) ("Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalevidence.com/rules-of-evidence#Rule103 |title=Federal Rules Of Evidence (2015) &amp;#124; Federal Evidence Review |publisher=Federalevidence.com |date= |accessdate=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The general burden when arguing that [[evidence (law)|evidence]] was improperly excluded or included is to show that the proper ruling by the trial judge may have, on the [[balance of probabilities]], resulted in the opposite determination of fact.

In the case of ''Earll v. State of Wyoming'', the [[Wyoming Supreme Court]] distinguished between [[reversible error]] (which requires a [[conviction]] be overturned) and harmless error (which does not), as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://wyomcases.courts.state.wy.us/applications/oscn/deliverdocument.asp?citeid=274666 2001 WY 66] [[Case citation|29 P.3d 787]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Cquote|Before we hold that an error has affected an accused’s substantial right, thus requiring reversal of a  conviction, we must conclude that, based on the entire record, a reasonable possibility exists that, in the absence of the error, the verdict might have  been more favorable to the accused.&lt;ref&gt;''Jones v. State'', [[Case citation|735 P.2d 699]], 703 (Wyo. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the evidentiary context, a harmless error is usually one where the evidence had no relevance to the issues to be decided by the trier of fact, evidence admitted actually helped the party seeking the reversal, or the remaining evidence was overwhelmingly against the party seeking reversal.

For example, a [[prosecutor]] may try to bolster his case by bringing in an [[expert witness]] to explain the behavior of one of the key witnesses.  If the judge allows the expert to testify that there was a reason to explain away inconsistencies in the witness's testimony, this will most likely be grounds for an appeal, as in most cases evidence that only bolsters the [[credibility]] of a witness is not [[Admissible evidence|admissible]].  However, if there were a number of other witnesses against the losing party, the [[appellate court]] may rule that this mistake was of no consequence and that even if the evidence had been excluded, the losing party would have lost.

[[Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure]] 52(a) provides that "Any error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2901">In [[law]], a '''hereditament''' (from [[Latin]] ''hereditare'', to inherit, from ''heres'', heir) is any kind of [[property]] that can be [[inheritance|inherited]].

Hereditaments are divided into corporeal and incorporeal. '''Corporeal hereditaments''' are "such as affect the senses, and may be seen and handled by the body; incorporeal are not the subject of sensation, can neither be seen nor handled, are creatures of the mind, and exist only in contemplation".&lt;ref&gt;[[William Blackstone|Blackstone]], ''Commentaries''&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a corporeal hereditament is [[real property|land]] held in [[Fee simple|freehold]] and in [[leasehold]].

Examples of '''incorporeal hereditaments''' are [[hereditary title]]s of honour or dignity, heritable titles of office, [[coats of arms]], [[prescriptive barony|prescriptive baronies]], [[pension]]s, [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuities]], [[rentcharge]]s, [[exclusive right|franchises]] &amp;mdash; and any other interest having no physical existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/manors/practice-guide-22-manors HM Land Registry Practice Guide 22 Manors at section 2: Lordship titles&lt;/ref&gt; Two categories have been abolished in [[England and Wales]] and certain other parts of the British Isles which related to the church: [[tithe]]s and [[advowson]]s. The term featured in the one-time "sweeper definition", catch-all phrase, "lands, [[tenement (law)|tenements]] and hereditaments" deprecated in contemporary legal documents. The terms "land, buildings" and where such land is unregistered "[[wikt:appurtenant|appurtenant]] rights" invariably coupled with itemised lists more properly describe property respectively forming and connected with land, as distinguished from goods and [[Personal property|chattel]]s or movable property.

==Other meanings==
In the UK the word is used in annual property taxation; its practical definition being the answer to the question, “as a matter of fact and degree, is or will the building, as a building, be ready for occupation, or capable of occupation, for the purposes for which it is intended?” combined with tests surrounding whether it is a dwelling and [[common law|case law decisions]], for example whether:
*other structures than homes such as garages part of the ''hereditament''
*the addition or reduction of small parcels of land constitutes a new "hereditament".&lt;ref name=voa&gt;http://manuals.voa.gov.uk/corporate/publications/Manuals/CouncilTaxManual/council_tax_man_pn/c-ct-man-pn1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Subsections 21 (2) and (3) of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 - incorporates the taxation definition of '''hereditament''' in an otherwise repealed section of the General Rate Act 1967.

'''''Hors de combat''''', literally meaning "outside the fight", is a French term used in [[diplomacy]] and [[international law]] to refer to persons who are incapable of performing their ability to wage [[war]]. Examples include [[fighter pilot]]s or [[aircrew]]s [[Attacks on parachutists|parachuting from their disabled aircraft]], as well as the sick, wounded, detained, or otherwise disabled. Persons ''hors de combat'' are normally granted special protections according to the [[law of war|laws of war]], sometimes including [[prisoner-of-war]] status, and therefore officially become [[non-combatant]]s. 

Under the [[Geneva Conventions|1949 Geneva Conventions]], [[unlawful combatant]]s ''hors de combat'' are granted the same privilege and to be treated with humanity while in captivity but unlike lawful [[combatant]]s, they are subject to trial and punishment, which includes [[capital punishment]].

[[Protocol I]] to the Geneva Conventions defines:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebART/470-750050?OpenDocument |work=International Humanitarian Law|title=Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), 8 June 1977, Part III : Methods and means of warfare – Combatant and prisoner-of-war status #Section I – Methods and means of warfare, Article 41 – Safeguard of an enemy hors de combat, Paragraph 2|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=2009-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A person is ''hors de combat'' if:
: (a) he is in the power of an adverse Party;
: (b) he clearly expresses an intention to surrender; or
: (c) he has been rendered unconscious or is otherwise incapacitated by wounds or sickness, and therefore is incapable of defending himself;
provided that in any of these cases he abstains from any hostile act and does not attempt to escape.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In literature==

*[[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] wrote of Froggy Parker as Amory Blaine flirted with Isabelle in ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'': {{Quote|On her right Froggy was ''hors de combat already'', although he hadn't quite realized it.}}
*[[Baroness Orczy]] wrote in her famous novel ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'': {{Quote|When we find them, there will be a band of desperate men at the bay. Some of our men, I presume, will be put hors de combat. These royalists are good swordsmen, and the Englishman is devilish cunning, and looks very powerful.}}
*[[Kurt Vonnegut]] described himself as ''hors de combat'' on the title page of his famous anti-war novel, ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'': {{Quote|...who, as an American infantry scout hors de combat, as a prisoner of war, witnessed the [[fire bombing of Dresden]]...}}
*[[Jules Verne]], in ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'', has [[Captain Nemo]] explain: {{Quote|Professor, I am sorry for one of the best vessels in the American navy; but they attacked me, and I was bound to defend myself. I contented myself, however, with putting the frigate hors de combat; she will not have any difficulty in getting repaired at the next port.}}
*[[Alexandre Dumas]]'s characters in ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' several times refer to men wounded as "hors de combat", specifically when describing fights to others as a method of recounting casualties, such as the King [[Louis XIII of France]] to the Musketeers after a violent time in the city: {{Quote| Seven of his Eminence's Guards placed ''hors de combat'' by you four in two days! That's too many, gentlemen, too many!&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1257/1257-h/1257-h.htm#his-majesty-king-louis-xiii&lt;/ref&gt;}}
*The well-known safari-hunting author [[Peter Hathaway Capstick]] uses the phrase in various contexts in his books ''The Last Ivory Hunter'', ''Death in the Long Grass'', and ''Death in the Silent Places''.
*[[Tom Wolfe]] in the final chapter of his last novel ''[[Back to Blood]]'': {{Quote|Publisher desPortes did not seem to be in any rush to avenge the honor of the Miami Herald. In fact, as his presumed French ancestors might have put it, he seemed decidedly ''hors de combat''.}}

The taxable amount a company is liable for is composed of its tax base multiplied with the relevant tax rate in its country of settlement. The tax base for a company will in general be the final amount reported in the statement of profit or loss plus or minus any comprehensive income or loss. There are however situations where the accounting profit may differ from the taxable profit. This difference that arises most likely needs to be settled in a future period. Therefore the difference needs to be recognised on the balance sheet as a tax asset or liability. A tax asset is only recognisable to the extent that is likely to be recovered in the future, where a tax liability always needs to be recognised in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Accounting Standard 12 - Income Taxes|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/docs/consolidated/ias12_en.pdf|website=Europa.eu|publisher=European Union|accessdate=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32693">The '''International Association for the Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy''' (IVR) is a learned society for science and was founded in 1909 as the "Internationale Vereinigung für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie". The IVR is the world's central academic organization for the study and advancement of legal and social philosophy.

==Mission==

The primary activities of the IVR include a World Congress every two years, publication of the international journal ''Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie'' (ARSP)&lt;ref&gt;https://ivronlineblog.wordpress.com/arsp/&lt;/ref&gt;, and the IVR Encyclopedia of the Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy. The seat of IVR is in Wiesbaden, in the Federal Republic of Germany.

The IVR is divided into autonomous national sections embracing most of the nations of the world. 

Many notable academics have served as president of the organization, including [[Neil MacCormick]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12454642.Law_professor_still_doing_his_job_justice/&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Scotland]]), Ulfrid Neumann ([[Germany]]), Enrico Pattaro ([[Italy]]), Eugenio Bulygin ([[Argentina]]) and [[Mortimer Sellers]]&lt;ref&gt;https://ivronlineblog.wordpress.com/2015/07/31/new-president-and-executive-committee-of-the-ivr/&lt;/ref&gt; (U.S.).

==History==

===Founding and early years===
The International Association for the Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy (IVR) was founded in 1909 as the “Internationale Vereinigung für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie”.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Carl Wellman, ''One Hundred Years of the IVR'', in: ARSP Vol. 95, 2009, pp. 1–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years ago, the journal „Archiv für Rechts- und Wirtschaftsphilosphie mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der Gesetzgebungsfragen“ („Archive for Philosophy of Law and Economic Philosophy with special Regard to the Issues of Legislation“) had been found. The foundation of the „Archive“ took place during a phase of revivification of the philosophy of law in Germany, which began at the end of the 19th century and continued to spread at the beginning of the 20th century. The founding fathers of both the „Archive“ in 1907 and later in 1909 also of the IVR were [[Josef Kohler]] (1849–1919) and [[Fritz Berolzheimer]] (1869–1920).

'''Founding father Fritz Berolzheimer (1869–1920):'''
From Arthur Kohler‘s essay „Von der Wiege des Archivs“ (From the cradle of the Archive) from 1930/31 we know, that the idea for founding a Journal for the philosophy of law on a neo-idealistic basis was from Fritz Berolzheimer, a lawyer and private scholar from Munich. This idea coincided with Kohler‘s distinctive interest in founding new academic enterprises. Both men knew each other from academic correspondence, which derived from the publishing of Berolzheimer‘s five-volume „System der Rechts- und Wirtschaftsphilosophie“ („A system of Philosophy of Law and Economic Philosophy“, 1904–1907/08). This opus dealt not only with Hegel, but also with Josef Kohler‘s philosophy intensively. In 1906, Berolzheimer even wrote an article on „J. Kohler as an philosopher of law“ („J. Kohler als Rechtsphilosoph“).

'''Founding father Josef Kohler (1849–1919):'''
Josef Kohler was born in Offenburg, Grand Duchy of Baden (Southwestern Germany). After studying law in Freiburg and Heidelberg, Kohler at first worked as lawyer and-later-as a judge in Mannheim. In 1878 he was appointed professor for Civil Procedure in Würzburg, which is remarkable because even though Kohler was a doctor of law and was experienced in the practice of law, he was not officially qualified to give postdoctoral lectures. After ten years in Würzburg, Kohler in 1888 accepted a call to a chair in Berlin. It was Berlin which inspired him to go further, scientifically and as an artist. He died there after 30 years of tireless work in 1919. 

'''Kohler and Berolzheimer:'''
Kohler and Berolzheimer were as different as they could be. Berolzheimer was not, as Kohler, an unresting scientist, who „wants to deduce and thus conquer one sphere of being after the other“&lt;ref&gt;Georg Lasson, ''Fritz Berolzheimer'', in: ARWP Vol. 14 (1920/1921), p. 238–250, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;. Other than Kohler, Berolzheimer was oriented „to the great principles fully“. A "systematic", who subordinated „all findings to these principles“. And he was „tirelessly“ trying to „convince and persuade his fellow men and women of these principles.“&lt;ref&gt;Lasson, ibid., p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Founding father Walter Rothschild (1879–1967):'''
With Kohler and Berolzheimer there were two motivated and proficient authors. But they lacked somebody to give them a voice. The man to give Kohler and Berolzheimer this voice was young publisher Walther Rothschild (1879-1967), who was about to establish a Publishing house for cultural studies and political philosophy. He made the duo a triumvirate. With regard to this triumvirate, Arthur Kohler, the son of Josef Kohler, reports: „Josef Kohler was a great inspirer and stimulator, though every detail had to be reviewed by him, and he entertained international connections and footing; Berolzheimer was particularly engaged in the details of editing and was a proficient organizer; Rothschild knew how to propagate expertly.“&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Kohler, ''Von der Wiege des Archivs'', in: ARWP Vol. 24 (1930/31), pp. 3–6, as cited in: Ziemann, pp. 412–413, p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rothschild Publishing House:'''
The "Archive" originally was published by the Dr. Walther Rothschild Verlagsbuchhandlung (Dr. Walther Rothschild Publishing House). Estimated in 1905, Rothschild Publishing House soon became a well respected Publisher for cultural studies, political philosophy, and philosophy of law. 
The fundamental idea of Rothschild Publishing House is well described by the following words celebrating the 25th anniversary in 1930: “The work of the scholar prospers in solitude. Trusting his own strain of thoughts alone and without any help, the scholar seeks to deduce the laws of the world, to find formulations that are valid. (…) For the scientific person, the penetration of the absolute means happiness and fulfillment. The general public is indifferent to this internal process, at first. The sphere of privacy will be crossed only when the publisher gives these thoughts a broader footing; when he makes a book out of a manuscript. In this way, ideas go out to the world. Printed work imparts results and further tasks to the scientific world. It creates intellectual currents which connect times and countries.”&lt;ref&gt;Otto Bettmann, ''Staat und Menschheit. Ideengeschichte des Verlags Dr. Walter Rothschild'', 1930.&lt;/ref&gt;
Owner and leading figure of the publishing house was Historian Walther Rothschild (1879–1967). Historian Walter Rothschild (Doctor of philosophy 1902) was owner and leading figure of the Dr. Walther Rothschild Verlagsbuchhandlung (Dr. Walther Rothschild Publishing House). Although of the same name, he was not related to the famous Jewish family. However, Rothschild was forced to withdraw from the publishing business in 1933. He then emigrated to the USA, where he died in Carmel/CA in 1967.
In 1933, Rothschild Publishing House ended publishing the „Archive“. It was the same year the publishing house „vanished“ from the index of Berlin booksellers—the reason for this has not been clarified until now. The „Archive“ was taken over by the „Verlag für Staatswissenschaften und Geschichte“ (1933-38; „Publishing house for Political Sciences and History“), followed by the „Albert Limbach Verlag“ (1938–44).

===IVR‘s Founding Organization 1909===

====IVR Founding Members 1909====
166 Persons have been listed as Founding Members of the IVR in Oct. 1st, 1909 &lt;ref&gt;List of Founding Members from 1909, in: ARWP, Vol. 3, 1909/10.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mainly they came from: Germany (96), Austria-Hungary (14), The Netherlands (11), Switzerland (9), Italy (6), Russia (6).

====IVR Presidents and Committee Members 1909====

'''Presidents:'''
According to its Statute of 1909, the IVR was chaired by three Presidents: Fritz Berolzheimer as Managing President (Geschäftsleitender Vorsitzender), Carl Fürstenberg as Financial President (Vorsitzender für die Vermögensangelegenheiten), and Josef Kohler as Honorary President (Ehrenpräsident).

'''Honorary Council:'''
Moreover, the Statute of 1909 demanded a Council of Honorary Councillors from 15 non-German nations (Ehrenrat der außerdeutschen Kulturstaaten&lt;ref&gt;Cf. § 12 Statute of 1909&lt;/ref&gt;. Among these were well-known scholars like French sociologist Émile Durkheim and Italian legal philosopher. But among these councillors were also delegates from far-away countries like Ernesto Quesada from Buenos Aires (Argentina), Clovis Bevilaqua from Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Govindo Dàs from Benares (India).

'''Advisory Committee:'''
The Managing President was also supported by an Advisory Committee consisting of 40 members, who were in charge for advisory opinions for important matters.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. § 13 IVR Statute of 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IVR Patrons:'''
It was clear to the founders that the activities of the new association had to be financed. In order to fulfil this need, the IVR Statute of 1909 ruled that a patronage could be achieved by donating at least 1.000 Marks. In the history of the association, two persons opened up their wallets and served as IVR Patrons: Industrialist and maecenas Wilhelm Merton (1848–1916). He was the owner of the Metallgesellschaft, which was one of the largest industrial companies in the world. Merton is regarded as one of the most prominent industrialists in the Wilhelmenian period. Bankier Wilhelm von Pechmann (1859–1949), who was Directorate Member of the Bayerische Handelsbank München (Bavarian Merchant Bank). Patronage was abolished under the rule of the Statute of 1935/36.

'''IVR Protector:'''
According to § 7 of the IVR statute of 1909, one could become Protektor of the association (meaning a patron). At this time, protectorate mainly was offered to nobility. In 1910, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine (1868–1937; Reign 1892–1918) agreed to be a IVR Protector. The Grand Duke was a great patron of the arts; his motto was “My Hesse should flourish, and the art in Hesse too” (“Mein Hessenland blühe und in ihm die Kunst”). In his residence at the south Hessian city of Darmstadt, he was founder of the Darmstadt Artists' Colony with Art Nouveau buildings (in Germany commonly known as “Jugendstil”). It was this very city where the association's second congress took place in 1911. The Protectorate was abolished by the statute of 1935/36, one year before the death of the last Grand Duke of Hesse in 1937.

===Early IVR congresses===

'''First IVR congress in Berlin 1910:'''
In May 1910, the first IVR Congress was held in Berlin at the Preußisches Herrenhaus (Prussian House of Lords). The Congress was attended by about 70 participants and 20 accompanying wives - mostly, but not all, Germans. The academic program, consisting of about 10 lectures, focused on basic questions of the philosophy of Law. Both founding fathers Kohler and Berolzheimer gave programmatic lectures: Kohler gave one on „Aufgaben und Ziele der Rechtsphilosophie“ („Tasks and Aims of Philosophy of Law“) and Berolzheimer on „Der Methodenstreit in der Rechtsphilosophie der Gegenwart“ („Dispute over Method in current Philosophy of Law“). A lecture was given by Walter Pollack using a diascope ("Lichtbilderdemonstration"). The social program of the first congress was quite modest: a welcoming evening at the Palace Hotel and two afternoon receptions at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Kohler and Mr. and Mrs. Fürstenberg (the latter having a grand villa in western Berlin, in Grunewald). In 1910 as well, Kohler was dean of the faculty of law, celebrating the jubilee of the University‘s founding. Under the aegis of dean Kohler, American president Roosevelt and the German Emperor were granted Honorary Doctors.

'''Second IVR Congress in Darmstadt 1911:'''
In 1911, the second IVR congress took place in Darmstadt under the patronage of Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine (1868–1937). The congress was attended by about 120 delegates – many of them members from South Hessian judicial authority. On the second day, even the Grand Duke himself was attending the congress. The academic program consisted of about 12 lectures. Special attention was given to questions of reform, especially with regard to legal education and judicial training.

'''Third IVR Congress in Frankfurt 1914:'''
In 1914, the third IVR congress took place in Frankfurt. Originally the congress was intended to take place at the Royal Academy in the east Prussian city of Posen (Poznań, now west-central Poland), but was relocated to Frankfurt. In Frankfurt, the congress took place at the Akademie für Sozial- und Handelswissenschaften (Academy for Social and Commercial Sciences). The academy was founded in 1901 and was financed by the city of Frankfurt. It became one of the founding institutions of the university in 1914. The congress was attended by about 170 delegates and concentrated on practical questions of law and economy; nevertheless, IVR Presidents Josef Kohler und Fritz Berolzheimer contributed programmed lectures on “Grenzen der Rechtsphilosophie” (Limits of the Philosophy of Law) and “Programm des Neo-Hegelianismus” (Programme of Neo-Hegelism).
Coincidentally, the congress files of the third congress have been preserved at the Frankfurt city archive: letters by the organizing committee, minutes of meetings. Even the invoice of the reception at the Römer (The Roman), Frankfurt town hall, has been preserved - by the way, the same place, the reception of the 25th World Congress will take place. The preserved writings provide an insight into the process of organizing a congress in the early days of the IVR. In fact, many matters the organizers had to arrange with, sound familiar: continuous meetings of the organizing committee; negotiations about favourable alternatives for accommodation and transport etc.; configuration of a social program (Geselligkeitsprogramm) for all participants, consisting of a city reception, a reception at the Frankfurt Chamber of Trade (Handelskammer), and an excursion to the reconstructed Roman fort Saalburg located on the Taunus ridge near famous spa town Bad Homburg. The reception at the Town hall was paid by the city of Frankfurt (in total 1092,90 Marks). Besides the cost of catering, this sum included cigars (35,35 Marks) and a red carpet at the Kaisertreppe (Emperor‘s staircase). The staircase was destroyed in World War II, but its portal has remained and can be seen during the City Reception.

===Interwar period and dissolution===
In the years 1919/1920, the Association had to bear a big loss - the passing of its founders Josef Kohler (†1919) and Fritz Berolzheimer (†1920). The IVR was then presided by private law scholar Peter Klein (1880-1926), and after his death in 1925, by criminal law scholar Wilhelm Sauer (1879–1962) and Goetz Briefs (1889–1974). The last congress of old series was held in Berlin in 1926.
In 1933, two changes took place: firstly, the Archive‘s name was changed to „Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie“ („Archive for Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy“); secondly, Rothschild Publishing House seized to publish the „Archive“ and vanished from the index of Berlin booksellers – the reason for this has not been clarified until now. 
After the takeover of power by the National Socialists in 1933, Vice President Goetz Briefs, being a Catholic social philosopher, was removed from office and forced to leave the country. He emigrated to the USA. After being a guest lecturer at the Catholic University in Washington D.C., he became a full Professor at Georgetown University in 1937.
In 1935, Carl August Emge (1886–1970) became president of the IVR and also editor of the „Archive“. Since 1933, Emge was a professor for philosophy of law at Berlin University. Concerning the political orientation, in 1948, it was emphasized in favor of Emge, "that the IVR was not subordinated to any other organization and maintained its apolitical, purely scientific character".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Minute of meeting, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1944, the IVR was dissolved in the war-confusion. At this time, the association had nearly 1000 members.

===From resurrection to present time===
After resurrection in 1948, the first IVR world congress was held in Saarbrücken (Germany) in 1957, followed by the Congress in Vienna (Austria), in 1959. After this, the world congresses were ordinarily organized every four years, occasionally supplemented by an extraordinary congress. Since 1981, the world congress is organized every two years (see box below). The first congress outside Europe was organized by Gray Dorsey (IVR President 1975-79) in St. Louis (USA) in 1975. Before this, the IVR primarily was a European organization with a few national sections abroad, the largest in Japan and in the USA. During the presidency of Dorsey, the IVR became a worldwide organization. Soon after the congress in St. Louis, Congresses were held in Australia (Sydney &amp; Canberra 1977), Mexico (Mexico City 1981), and Japan (Kobe 1987).

==Structure==
The association has over 2000 members worldwide. They are organized in 41 national sections, which are autonomous with respect to the organization of their events and also solely responsible for their financial affairs.

==Trivia==

===Founding Era - Editorial meetings held at Café===
As we get to know by Arthur Kohler, the son of IVR’s Founding father Josef Kohler, in former times the „Archive‘s“ editorial meeting were held at the Romanisches Café in Berlin (Romanesque Cafe). 
The Romanisches Café (Romanesque Café) was located in the ground floor of a neo-romanesque building complex vis-à-vis to the famous Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche (Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church) in western Berlin, which was also build in romanesque style. Towards the end of World War I, the Café became the meeting place of the bohemian society of Berlin, especially after the „Café des Westens“ (Café of the West), a famous artists‘ café, had to relocate and was shut down in 1915. Every group had its regulars table - painters, philosophers, journalists, critics, dramatists, essayists, psychoanalysts. Following a secret hierarchy, the café was divided in two sections: a place called „nonswimmer pond“ („Nichtschwimmer-Bassin“) for guests and tourists, and the „swimmer pond“ „Schwimmer-Bassin“) for regulars, celebrities and - on a gallery - chess players. The permission to enter the swimmer pond had to be worked on hard and was strictly controlled by the doorman.
German Author and satirist Erich Kästner reports: „The “Romanisches Café“ (Romanesque Café) is the ante room for talents. There are people who have been waiting here for twenty years, every day, for talent. They possess, if nothing else, the ability to wait to an extraordinary degree. (…) They are an infernal mass of eccentrics and those who would like to be so. The first impression is: Hair, manes, curls that fall into eyes, fraught with meaning. The second impression: How often do they change their underwear? This impression may be unjustified in many cases. But on the other hand, nothing could be more distinctive for the seen, than that one has this impression in the first place.“&lt;ref&gt;Erich Kästner, ''Das Rendezvous der Künstler'', in: Neue Leipziger Zeitung, 26 April 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding father Arthur Kohler - A Legal Graphomaniac===
2.482 publications derive from Kohler‘s hand. The bibliography from 1931/12, which was compiled by his son Arthur Kohler in 10 years of work, enlists publications concerning truly to all branches of law such as Patent Law, Intellectual Property Law, and Comparative Law. Moreover, Kohler was artistically active, composing music and poetry. It has been calculated, that Kohler in average published one paper a week&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Gängel &amp; Michael Schaumburg, ''Josef Kohler – Rechtsgelehrter und Rechtslehrer an der Berliner Alma mater um die Jahrhundertwende'', in: ARSP Vol. 75 (1989), p. 289–312, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;; and his son reports of 20 hour shifts&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Kohler, ''Zur Ehrung Josef Kohlers. II. Erinnerungen an Josef Kohler'', in: ARWP Vol. 26 (1932/33), p. 212–217, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; For his contemporary colleagues, this overwhelming creative power was either criticized because of its skechyness or admired as product of the last „universal scholar“, sometimes this creativity was even perceived as „eerie“ (&lt;ref&gt;v.Jhering, as cited in: Rainer Maria Kiesow, ''Josef Kohlers Poesie'', in: Rainer Maria Kiesow et al. (eds.), Summa – Dieter Simon zum 70. Geburtstag. Frankfurt am Main 2005, p. 297–318, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; Surely „the greatest legal graphomaniac of all times and worlds“ &lt;ref&gt;Rainer Maria Kiesow, ''Josef Kohlers Poesie'', in: Rainer Maria Kiesow et al. (eds.), Summa – Dieter Simon zum 70. Geburtstag. Frankfurt am Main 2005, p. 297–318, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Religious Liberty Association''' ('''IRLA''') is a non-sectarian and non-political organization promoting religious freedom. It was originally organized by the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] leaders in 1893 to campaign for [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]] for all when the danger of restrictions from [[blue laws]] became apparent. Its headquarters are in [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], [[Maryland]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;[http://www.irla.org/aboutus/index.html About Us]. International Religious Liberty Association. Retrieved 2009-08-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission statement==
The IRLA's mission statement says: "The International Religious Liberty Association will disseminate the principles of religious liberty throughout the world; defend and safeguard the civil right of all people to worship or not to worship, to adopt a religion or belief of their choice, to manifest their religious convictions in observance, promulgation, and teaching, subject only to the respect for the equivalent rights of others; support the right of religious organizations to operate freely in every country by their establishing and owning charitable or educational institutions; and organize local, regional, and national chapters as well as seminars, and congresses."

==History==

{{Empty section|date=June 2010}}

== Activities ==
Since 2003, IRLA has organized the annual ''Religious Liberty Dinner'' to celebrate and bring attention to freedom of religion or belief, both in the United States and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irla.org/oct-2003|title=October 2003 Report to Constituent Members|last=|first=|date=|website=International Religious Liberty Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.religiouslibertydinner.com/|title=Religious Liberty Dinner|last=|first=|date=|website=Religious Liberty Dinner|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also presents ''International Religious Freedom Award'' to individuals for their outstanding service to freedom of religion or belief.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12470">'''Jurisdictional arbitrage''' is the practice of taking advantage of the discrepancies between competing legal [[jurisdiction]]s. It takes its name from [[arbitrage]], the practice in [[finance]] of purchasing a good at a lower price in one market and selling it at a higher price in another. Just as in financial arbitrage, the attractiveness of jurisdiction arbitrage depends largely on its [[transaction cost]]s, here the costs of switching legal service providers from one [[government]] to another.&lt;ref name=dyn&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The lower the [[Departure tax|exit costs]] for leaving the jurisdiction (unrestricted emigration, cheap travel, [[liquidity]] of assets) the more desirable and feasible it is. Conversely, high [[entry cost]]s into the more favourable jurisdiction are an inhibitor on jurisdictional arbitrage; certain [[tax haven]]s such as [[Andorra]] grant permanent residency rights to immigrants only if they meet certain criteria. Jurisdictional arbitrage is a significant concept in modern free market [[anarcho-capitalism]], not to be confused with [[anarchism]] per se.

== Applications ==
The practice of individuals [[asylum seeker|seeking asylum]] involves appealing to a jurisdiction with favorable individual rights for residency, where the individual's native jurisdiction is seen to offer insufficient protection. For example, women have fled West African nations which practice tribal [[female genital mutilation]] and/or [[Wahhabism|extremist Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;No interpretation of Islam demands female circumcision, contrary to popular opinion. See ''Reliance of the Traveller and Tools of the Worshipper (Umdat al-Salik)'', trans. Nuh Ha Mim Keller&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of [[Europe]]an and [[North America]]n jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;

To avoid arbitrary restrictions on skilled immigration, high-tech companies may set up offices in countries neighboring those with the restrictive policies, preferably in locations close to the border, as was the case with [[Microsoft]]'s plans to open a satellite office in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft pressures U.S. in Vancouver move |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=3a2cbdc5-95ad-45b5-9fb1-fe1fb3656f37&amp;k=23394 |publisher=[[National Post]] |accessdate=2012-03-02 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65rMazlyZ?url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=3a2cbdc5-95ad-45b5-9fb1-fe1fb3656f37 |archivedate=2012-03-02 |date=2007-07-06 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; situated only 140 miles (225&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Microsoft Redmond Campus|its headquarters]] in the [[Seattle]] suburb of [[Redmond, Washington]] in the United States. In [[Silicon Valley]], a project is underway to launch a ship 12 [[nautical miles]] from the shore, in [[international waters]], with the goal of allowing entrepreneurs without US work visas to legally create and work for companies close to the area (see [[Blueseed]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCullagh |first=Declan |title=Visa problems?

On the other hand, jurisdictional arbitrage has also been utilized to hinder attempts at governmental prosecution, by transnational criminals such as [[terrorists]],&lt;ref&gt;"Anti-terror measures hit formal finance", ''[[Oxford Analytica]]'', 2004-05-25. Retrieved 2008-02-29. "This is especially important given terrorists' ability to exercise jurisdictional arbitrage."&lt;/ref&gt; [[money laundering|money launderers]], and [[cyber warfare|cyber-attackers]].&lt;ref name=kshetri&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to recent international mobilization against the practice, there existed a long-standing tradition of ousted state leaders such as [[Erich Honecker]], [[Idi Amin]] and [[Augusto Pinochet]] finding refuge and retirement abroad to avoid prosecution in their native jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Universal Jurisdiction: National Courts and the Prosecution of Serious Crimes Under International Law|editor=Stephen Macedo |date=February 1, 2006 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1950-3|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinochet, one-time military leader of [[Chile]] sought to evade retributive prosecution in his native jurisdiction by seeking refuge in the [[United Kingdom]]. He was later prosecuted by a [[Spain|Spanish]] court according to the principle of [[universal jurisdiction]].

To counteract this phenomenon, most countries have signed bilateral [[extradition]] treaties with most other countries, and some governments adopted the principle of universal jurisdiction, which has enabled individuals to be prosecuted for offences (particularly alleged [[human rights]] violations and [[war crime]]s) committed outside the jurisdiction of prosecution &amp;ndash; the legal structure of nations such as [[Belgium]] and [[Spain]] allow for this, as does that of international tribunals operating under the aegis of the [[United Nations]].

A similar attempt at governmental collusion to limit the use of jurisdictional arbitrage for [[tax avoidance]] is the policy of [[tax harmonization]]. The membership of European governments in the [[European Union]] resulted in a collection of nations with a limited set of common legal structures ([[Four Freedoms (European Union)|Four Freedoms]]) which has resulted in  [[tax competition]] by the otherwise less-developed nations (such as the [[Republic of Ireland]] in the early 1990s) whereby governments compete for [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] by lowering their tax rates significantly below those of their neighbours. This strategy has been adopted in the form of a [[flat tax]] by various Eastern European nations, which has resulted in calls for harmonization of tax rates by the traditionally more developed nations such as [[France]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Advocates ==
[[Anarcho-capitalists]] hope that by subdividing existing governmental jurisdictions into [[city-state]]s (such as [[Singapore]]), competition among jurisdictions for citizens will lead to a diversity of legal climates including more favourable jurisdictions for [[liberty]] and [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[seasteading]] is an attempt to increase the possibility of jurisdictional arbitrage by decreasing the cost of switching governments. It is worth noting that there is nothing [[anarchist]] about jurisdictional arbitrage, since it is a strategy based on profiting from the differences between regulatory regimes, and therefore incompatible with the abolition of the state.

A notable proponent and practitioner of jurisdictional arbitrage is Canadian businessman and [[perpetual traveler]]  [[Calvin Ayre]], founder of [[online gambling]] consortium Bodog Entertainment Group.&lt;ref name=ayre&gt;{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Bashir |title=Online Gambling Mogul Living it Up |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=2108601&amp;page=1 |work=[[ABC News]] |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=2006-07-07 |accessdate=2008-02-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although online gambling is illegal in the [[United States]], a market which accounts for 95% of Bodog's sales, the company pays no [[corporate tax]]es there as its activities are distributed across different jurisdictions to minimise tax burden. "We run a business that can't actually be described as gambling in each country we operate in. But when you add it all together, it’s Internet gambling."&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news |first=Matthew |last=Miller |title=Catch Me If You Can |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2006/0327/112_print.html |work=[[Forbes]] |date=2006-03-27 |accessdate=2008-02-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 165(c) of the United States [[Internal Revenue Code]] limits losses that [[taxpayer]]s can deduct into three categories: business or trade losses, investment losses, and losses incurred from casualty or theft. A loss incurred by a taxpayer from the sale of the taxpayer's personal [[Household|residential property]] is not deductible. Personal residential property losses do not fit under any of the enumerated categories under Internal Revenue Code section 165(c). Furthermore, [[Income tax|Income Tax]] Treasury Regulation section 1.165-9 states that a loss sustained on the sale of residential property purchased or constructed by the taxpayer for use as his personal residence and so used by him up to the time of the sale is not deductible under Internal Revenue Code section 165(a).

However, if, prior to the sale of the personal residence, the taxpayer converts the residential property into a [[Renting|rental property]], a loss sustained on the sale of the property will be deductible under Internal Revenue Code section 165(c)(2). To calculate the loss on residential property that was converted into a rental, prior to the sale of the property, Treasury Regulation section 1.165-9(2) states that the basis of the property will be the lesser of either the [[fair market value]] at the time of conversion or the [[adjusted basis]] determined under Treasury Regulation section 1.1011-1.

==Early life==
Gogulski's grandparents emigrated to the U.S. in the 19th century; his paternal grandparents from near [[Poznań]], [[Poland]] and his maternal grandparents from Germany. Gogulski was born in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], but his family moved to [[Orlando, Florida]] soon after due to his father's job as an [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] engineer. He has a younger sister, Karen.&lt;ref name="Markiza"/&gt; He attended [[Lake Howell High School]], where he was a [[National Merit Scholarship Program]] finalist and a brain bowl team member; he graduated in 1990.&lt;ref name="OrlandoSentinel19920517"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-05-17/news/9205170281_1_computer-crime-hackers-computer-experts|first=Sharon|last=McBreen|title=Hacker's Arrest Highlights Trend: Phone Service Theft|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=1992-05-17|accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogulski entered [[Orlando College]] in 1990 to study computer science.&lt;ref name="Markiza"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OrlandoSentinel19921007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-10-07/news/9210070463_1_gogulski-guilt-plea-agreement|title=Casselberry Man Admits Guilt In Phone Fraud Case|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=1992-10-07|accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1992, while still a student there and living in [[Casselberry, Florida]], he became the first person to be arrested by the [[Orange County Sheriff's Office (Florida)|Orange County Sheriff's Office]] for computer hacking. Police stated that he had stolen at least $30,000 of long-distance telephone services.&lt;ref name="OrlandoSentinel19920517"/&gt; Among the victims of the theft were the county government, a tutorial service at the University of Florida, and an auto dealership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1290&amp;dat=19920501&amp;id=lU5UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=r40DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2697,87769|title=Teen faces charges of computer crimes|work=The News|date=1992-05-01|accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charged with one count of violating the Florida Communications Fraud Act, he pleaded guilty in [[Eighteenth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida|Seminole County Circuit Court]]; under a [[plea bargain|plea agreement]], he received two years of probation, but a formal ruling of guilt was withheld and no further charges were filed.&lt;ref name="OrlandoSentinel19921007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-04-30/news/9204300427_1_computer-lines-gogulski-agents|first=Sharon|last=McBreen|title=Computer Hacker Arrested|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=1992-04-30|accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later lost interest in his studies and withdrew from school. Nevertheless, he went on to a ten-year career as a [[system administrator]].&lt;ref name="Markiza"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mojcasopis.sk/zaujimave/pribeh/7395-trapi-ma-slovesny-vid.html |title=Trápi ma slovesný vid! |work=[[Markíza]] |date=2009-07-02 |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713042503/http://www.mojcasopis.sk/zaujimave/pribeh/7395-trapi-ma-slovesny-vid.html |archivedate=13 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogulski's father died in 2001. In 2004, Gogulski left the U.S. to teach English in [[Eastern Europe]]. He eventually ended up in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]], where he became a translator, proofreader, and editor.&lt;ref name="Markiza"/&gt;

==Renunciation of citizenship==
Gogulski renounced his citizenship in December 2008, though his name did not appear in the [[Internal Revenue Service]]'s [[Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to Expatriate]] until February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/02/11/2011-3178/quarterly-publication-of-individuals-who-have-chosen-to-expatriate-as-required-by-section-6039g|title=Quarterly Publication of Individuals, Who Have Chosen To Expatriate, as Required by Section 6039G|work=Federal Register|volume=76|issue=7907|pages=7907–7913|author=Internal Revenue Service|date=2011-02-11|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMwsc7d8LTI|title=US largest criminal in world|work=Russia Today|date=2010-08-04|accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was living in [[Slovakia]] at the time. After Gogulski renounced, the Slovak authorities issued a stateless person's travel document to him. He thus needs a [[United States visa]] in order to visit his mother, but he suspects that he would be unable to obtain one. He states that he is eligible to apply for [[Citizenship Act (Slovakia)|Slovak citizenship]], but prefers to remain stateless.&lt;ref name="GlobalPost"/&gt; As a legal resident of Slovakia, he can travel freely throughout the [[Schengen Area]]. In 2012 he was denied a British visa, an issue which he attributed to the short remaining validity period of his travel document.&lt;ref name="Spears"/&gt;

Gogulski stated that he renounced his citizenship in order to repudiate the American system, which he felt was the source of many wrongs in the world.&lt;ref name="GlobalPost"/&gt; Gogulski has stated that he hopes to start a mass movement of Americans giving up citizenship and making themselves stateless ''en masse''. He receives occasional enquiries from others who are interested in following in his footsteps and becoming stateless themselves; he advises them to "understand all the implications" before they make the leap, pointing out that while he has faced few hardships due to his statelessness, others may find it more difficult due to their personal situations.&lt;ref name="GlobalPost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spears"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spearswms.com/spears-world/article-of-the-week/47957/will-the-wealthy-burn-their-passports-the-pros-and-cons-of-modern-statelessness.thtml|first=Sophie|last=McBain|title=The Pros and Cons of Modern Statelessness|work=Spear's|date=2013-06-25|accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism==
In 1999, Gogulski founded the Connecticut Cannabis Policy Forum, which aimed to [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|remove all penalties for adult marijuana consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hemp.net/news/9905/28/pot_politics.shtml|first=Ken|last=Krayeske|title=Pot Politics|work=Hartford Advocate|date=1999-05-20|accessdate=2012-07-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012052328/http://www.hemp.net/news/9905/28/pot_politics.shtml|archivedate=12 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Gogulski founded the Private Manning Support Network, which organised protests in support of [[Chelsea Manning]] (a U.S. soldier convicted of disclosing classified documents to [[WikiLeaks]]) and raised $50,000 to fund her legal defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.english.rfi.fr/node/41402|first=Courtney|last=Traub|title=Free WikiLeaks Suspect Manning, say activists|work=[[Radio France Internationale]]|date=2010-08-20|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://antiwar.com/radio/2010/08/02/mike-gogulski-2/|title=Scott Horton Interviews Mike Gogulski|work=[[Antiwar.com]]|date=2010-08-02|accessdate=2012-05-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427120138/http://antiwar.com/radio/2010/08/02/mike-gogulski-2/|archivedate=27 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Justice of the German Democratic Republic''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Justizministerium der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik'' was established in 1949 in [[East Germany]] and dissolved in 1990. Its duties were subsequently taken up by the federal [[Federal Ministry of Justice (Germany)|Ministry of Justice]] of the united Germany, and the justice ministries of the six new federal states. The Ministry was housed at 93 Dorothea Street (Dorotheenstraße 93), the former offices of the Weimar and Nazi Interior Ministry. It published the journal ''[[Neue Justiz]]''.

==History==
After the [[Second World War]] and the collapse of [[Nazism]] in May 1945, [[Germany]] was divided into four [[Allied-occupied Germany|zones of occupation]], with the area that would become East Germany [[Soviet occupation zone|occupied]] by the [[Soviet Union]]. It was governed by the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]], ([[German language|German]]: ''Sowjetische Militäradministration in Deutschland'' (SMA)). On 17 July 1945, the SMAD issued Order No. 17, which established a judicial system in the Soviet occupation zone. The German Central Administration for Justice (German: Deutsche Zentralverwaltung für Justiz (DJV)) was subsequently founded in November 1945, with the SMAD appointing [[Eugen Schiffer]] as their first DJV president, though he was dismissed and replaced in 1948 with [[Max Fechner]]. In 1949, with the founding of the [[German Democratic Republic]] as a nominally independent state, the DJV was transformed into the Ministry of Justice.

Max Fechner was appointed the first Minister of Justice. By this time, the judiciary had already been brought into line with communist policy. Though mentioned in the [[Constitution of East Germany]], there was no guarantee of [[judicial independence]]. The use of [[Volksrichter]] ([[English language|English]] People's Judges) also helped to bring the courts closer to the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]]. In 1953, the [[States of Germany|Länder]] of the Eastern Zone were abolished, and their Justice Ministries became part of the central ministry. After speaking critically of the prosecution of strikers in the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|protests of June 1953]] in an interview with [[Neues Deutschland]], Fechner was removed from office, denounced as an "enemy of the state and the party" and spent three years in prison and [[Stasi]] internment. He was replaced by [[Hilde Benjamin]], who had presided over the [[show trials]] of the 1950s.

In 1963, the power of the ministry was weakened by a decree which transferred responsibility for control of the courts to the [[Supreme Court of East Germany]], which reported directly to the [[State Council of the German Democratic Republic|State Council]]. 

After the [[Die Wende|fall of the Berlin wall]], the Ministry of Justice oversaw the transfer of its powers back to the states and the drafting of the [[German reunification#German Reunification Treaty|Unification treaty]] under the supervision of Kurt Wünsche.

'''Misfeasance''', '''nonfeasance''' and '''malfeasance''' are types of failure to discharge public [[obligations]] existing by [[common law]], [[custom (law)|custom]] or [[statute]]. 

The [[Carta de Logu]] caused [[Eleanor of Arborea]] to be remembered as one of the first lawmakers to set up the crime of misfeasance.&lt;ref name="4Lalli2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Virginia Lalli|title=Women in Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpX8AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=February 2014|publisher=Author House|isbn=978-1-4918-6454-8|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and relevant rules of law==
When a contract creates a duty that does not exist at common law, there are three things the parties can do wrong:
* '''Nonfeasance''' is the failure to act where action is required — willfully or in neglect.
* '''Misfeasance''' is the willful inappropriate action or intentional incorrect action or advice.
* '''Malfeasance''' is the willful and intentional action that injures a party.

For example, if a company hires a catering company to provide drinks and food for a retirement party, and the catering company fails to show up, it is considered nonfeasance. If the catering company shows up but provides only the drinks (but not the food, which was also paid for), it is considered misfeasance. If the catering company accepts a bribe from the client's competitor to undercook the meat, thereby giving those present [[food poisoning]], it is considered malfeasance.

The rule of law laid down is that an action in contract (''[[ex contractu]]'') will lie for any of the three. However, an action in tort (''[[ex delicto]]'') will lie only in misfeasance or malfeasance. The doctrine was formerly applied to certain callings carried on publicly.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Kilderby'', 1669, 1 Will. Saund. 311, 312 c&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, the terms misfeasance and nonfeasance are most often used with reference to the conduct of municipal authorities with reference to the discharge of their statutory obligations; and it is an established rule that an action lies in favour of persons injured by misfeasance, by [[negligence]] in discharge of the duty but that in the case of nonfeasance the remedy is not by action but by indictment or ''[[mandamus]]'' or by the particular procedure prescribed by the statutes.

This rule is fully established in the case of failure to repair public highways, but in other cases, the courts are astute to find evidence of carelessness in the discharge of public duties and on that basis to award damages to individuals who have suffered.

Misfeasance is also used with reference to the conduct of directors and officers of [[joint-stock companies]]. The word is sometimes used as equivalent to [[medical malpractice|malpractice]] by a medical practitioner.

'''''Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp.''''', 571 U.S. ___ (2014), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court determined whether a [[class-action]] suit was properly removed to federal district court as a [[Mass tort|mass action]] under the [[Class Action Fairness Act of 2005|Class Action Fairness Act]].&lt;ref name="judgement"&gt;{{ussc|name=Mississippi ex rel. Hood v. AU Optronics Corp.|volume=571|docket=12-1036}} (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  The court unanimously determined ([[Sonia Sotomayor|Justice Sotomayor]] delivering the court's opinion) that since the state of [[Mississippi]] was the sole plaintiff in the lawsuit, the case did not constitute a mass action for the purposes of the Act.&lt;ref name="judgement"/&gt;

The case turned on a question of statutory construction. The Act defined a mass action as 'any civil action ... in which monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs’ claims involve common questions of law or fact'. The State of Mississippi sought restitution from a liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturer, including restitution for purchases of LCD products made by Mississippi citizens.  The court held that the reference in the Act to '100 or more persons' referred to actual plaintiffs and not to any individuals (in this case, unnamed Mississippi citizens) who may have an interest in, or benefit from, the action.&lt;ref name="judgement"/&gt;

'''''Mohr v. Williams''''', 104 [[North Western Reporter|N.W.]] 12 ([[Minnesota Supreme Court|Minn.]] 1905) is a decision of the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] authored by [[Calvin L. Brown]]. For almost a century, this case has been used in first-year [[Torts]] classes in [[Law school in the United States|American law schools]] to teach students about [[consent]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[John Henry Wigmore]], ''Select Cases on the Law of Torts'' (1912), Vol. 2, pp. 78-81; [[Richard Allen Epstein|Richard Epstein]], ''Cases and Materials on Torts'' (8th ed., 2004), pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Dr. Williams was a [[physician]] and [[surgeon]], practicing in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] and [[Specialty (medicine)|specializing]] in disorders of the [[ear]].&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"&gt;''Mohr v. Williams'', 104 N.W. 12 (Minn. 1905)&lt;/ref&gt;  Mrs. Mohr was a patient who came to Dr. Williams complaining of trouble with her right ear.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;  Dr. Williams examined her right ear and he discovered that there was a large perforation in the [[eardrum]], that there was a large [[Polyp (medicine)|polyp]] in the [[middle ear]], and that the [[ossicles]] of the middle ear were probably diseased.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;  Dr. Williams also examined Mrs. Mohr's left ear, but he was unable to make a full examination because of a foreign substance in the left ear.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;

On Dr. Williams' recommendation, Mrs. Mohr agreed to have [[surgery]] on her right ear to remove the polyp and diseased ossicles.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;  [[Anesthetics]] were used during the operation.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;  After the patient was unconscious, Dr. Williams made a full examination of Mrs. Mohr's left ear and discovered that it was in a worse state than her right ear: there was a small perforation high up in the drum membrane, hooded and with rough edges, and the bone of the inner wall of the middle ear was diseased and dead.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;  Dr. Williams also examined the right ear and found that it was not in as bad a condition as he had anticipated.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;  He therefore decided to operate on the left ear instead of the right, performing an ossiculectomy, removing a part of the drum membrane and scraping away the diseased portion of the inner ear.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;

Mrs. Mohr later brought suit against Dr. Williams, claiming that he had damaged her hearing and seriously injured her person, and that, because she had not [[consent]]ed to surgery on her left ear, his actions were wrongful and unlawful and constituted an [[Assault (tort)|assault]] and [[Battery (tort)|battery]].&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;  Mrs. Mohr asked the court to award her $20,000 in [[damages]].&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;  A [[trial]] was held in the district court for [[Ramsey County, Minnesota]] and the [[jury]] found for Mrs. Mohr and awarded her $14,322.50 in damages.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;  The trial judge set aside the jury's verdict as excessive.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;  Both parties appealed.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;

On appeal, Mrs. Mohr's lawyers, H. A. Loughran and S. C. Olmstead, argued that Mrs. Mohr's consent was necessary and without consent, Dr. Williams' actions constituted an assault and battery.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;  Dr. Williams' lawyers, Keith, Evans, Thompson &amp; Fairchild and John D. O'Brien, argued that in circumstances such as this, where a physician acted to arrest disease and save life, a physician's actions should be held lawful even if the patient did not explicitly consent to the surgery.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==

In an opinion authored by [[Calvin L. Brown]], the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Mrs. Mohr.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;

Justice Brown began by noting the basic principle of the law that "every person has a right to complete immunity of his person from physical interference of others, except in so far as contact may be necessary under the general doctrine of privilege; and any unauthorized touching of the person of another, except it be in the spirit of pleasantry, constitutes an assault and battery."&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;  Unlike the [[crime]] of [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] which requires proof of a bad [[intent (law)|intent]], for the tort of assault and battery, a touching is unlawful if it is unauthorized regardless of the defendant's intent.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;  Whether Dr. Williams' actions were authorized by Mrs. Mohr was a [[question of fact]] to be determined by the jury.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;  The court held that the fact that Mrs. Mohr's family physician attended the operation and agreed with Dr. Williams' decision to operate on the left ear was irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;

The court therefore affirmed the orders of the lower court.&lt;ref name="Minn 1905"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="909">A '''notice of default''' is a notification given to a [[borrower]] stating that he or she has not made their [[payment]]s by the predetermined deadline, or is otherwise in default on the mortgage contract. Other ways a borrower may be in default include not providing proper insurance coverage for the property, or not paying due property taxes as agreed. It dictates that if the money owed (plus an additional [[legal fee]]), or other breach(es) are not paid/remedied in a given time, the [[lender]] may choose to [[foreclose]] the borrower's property. Any other people who may be affected by the [[foreclosure]] may also receive a copy of the notification.

In the [[warez scene]], '''nuke''' refers to labeling content as "bad", for reasons which might include unusable software, bad video/audio quality, [[computer virus|virus]]-infected content, deceptively labeled (fake) content or not following the [[Standard (warez)|rules]]. Also duplicates and stolen releases from other pirates that do not attribute the other pirates will be nuked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rules.nukenet.info/t.html?id=2002_TV.nfo |title=TV release rules v1.5 |date=2002-11-16 |quote=A release is considered as a NUKE, if: It's a DUPE. It has technical issues. Wrong or no source/cap information is specified in the .nfo. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119163526/http://rules.nukenet.info/t.html?id=2002_TV.nfo |archivedate=2016-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Craig2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=goode /&gt;&lt;ref name="basamanowicz" /&gt; When a [[Warez scene|scene]] release is "nuked", a message is attached to its listing informing other sceners of its "nuked" status, as well as the specific nature of the problem.&lt;ref name="FunnyNukes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filenetworks.blogspot.com/2009/06/scene-nukewars-funniest-nuke-reasons.html |title=Funniest nuke reasons ever |date=2009-05-12 |work=FileNetworks |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708035407/http://filenetworks.blogspot.com/2009/06/scene-nukewars-funniest-nuke-reasons.html |archivedate=2011-07-08 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to what the term implies, a nuke does not actually destroy offending content or prevent anyone from downloading it. A nuke merely serves as a cautionary flag to potential users. The person that uploaded the nuked content to a [[Topsite (warez)|site]] will lose credits.&lt;ref name=Craig2005 /&gt;

==Issuing and removing nukes==

===Global nukes===
Titles can only be officially labeled as "nuked" by people who have special access to a listing [[database]], often referred to as "nukers". The nuke is issued by a nuke command in a nuke channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scenerules.irc.gs/rules.html |title=Basic nuke channel rules |work=SceneRules |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67WmOjQcv?url=http://scenerules.irc.gs/rules.html |archivedate=2012-05-09 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
 !nuke release reason [source]             (nukes a release)
 !unnuke release reason [source]           (unnukes a release)
 !renuke release reason [source]           (renukes a release)
 !modnuke release reason [source]          (modifies a nuke reason)
 !snuke release reason [source]            (a silent nuke: not announced in announce channels)
 !oldnuke release reason [source]          (for old releases, also a silent nuke)
Erroneous nukes are usually "un-nuked" easily, by the same people who have access to issue nukes, that nukes and unnukes happen on [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]. These nuke networks have their own guidelines on how to nuke a release.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
 |url=http://justsomerules.synthasite.com/onenet-rules.php 
 |title=oneNET nuke net rules 
 |date=2008-04-18

 |archivedate=2010-02-25 
 |deadurl=no 
 |df= 
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, twelve of those nuke networks created a coalition to work together "to ensure nukers bias, nukewars and many other problems that plague the nuke [[Warez scene|scene]] become a thing of the past."&lt;ref name="The.2008.Nuke.Ruleset-NukeCouncil"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scenerules.org/t.html?id=2008_NC.nfo|title=The.2008.Nuke.Ruleset-NukeCouncil|date=2008-11-08|work=SceneRules}}&lt;!-- original file: ncr-2008.nfo, pre date: 2008-11-08 22:13:55 CET, http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=1718 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local nukes===
Local nukes or site nukes can be issued by a [[Topsite (warez)|topsite]] administrator and are only applicable to that site. Each individual site has rules for which kind of releases that are allowed. e.g. no VCD releases. Hence a locally nuked release can still be valid.
:{{details|Topsite (warez)#Credit system}}

==Nukewars==
The situation where a release is nuked or unnuked more than four times is called a nukewar.&lt;ref name="FunnyNukes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The.2008.Nuke.Ruleset-NukeCouncil"/&gt;

Example&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.rlslog.net/hellgate-london-vitality-vs-flt/ |title=Hellgate London: nukewar between ViTALiTY and FLT |author=Martin |date=2007-11-01 |work=RlsLog.net |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721075153/http://www.rlslog.net/hellgate-london-vitality-vs-flt/ |archivedate=2011-07-21 |deadurl=no
}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a nukewar. The first two columns represent the time when the release was pred or when a nuke was issued. The next column is the category of the release.&lt;ref name="FunnyNukes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doopes.com/index.php?cat=33792&amp;lang=0&amp;num=2&amp;mode=0&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;exc=&amp;inc=Crossing.Jordan.S06E07&amp;opt=0 |title=Crossing Jordan: nukewar between NoTV and XOR |work=Doopes.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710144326/http://doopes.com/index.php?cat=33792&amp;lang=0&amp;num=2&amp;mode=0&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;exc=&amp;inc=Crossing.Jordan.S06E07&amp;opt=0 |archivedate=2011-07-10 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example two releases were released at almost the same time.

The clock of a computer is not always accurate.

==Examples==
Examples of content that could be "nuked" include non-working [[software]], non-working [[software crack|cracks]], videos with out-of-sync audio, watermarked videos, or music recordings with excessive "skips". The reason for a nuke is based on violations of the [[Standard (warez)|standards]] that must be followed.

Release database 
When a group pre's a release, the release will automatically be registered in the pre-database. This is huge database which contains all the releases ever release into the scene. This release databases records release names and their release date &amp; time, although fields vary from database to database. Examples of other common fields include genres (for mp3 releases), sections, and nuke details. Release databases are maintained to provide release groups with a service for checking existing release titles, to avoid a dupe (duplicate). Also users are able to check whether or not, for example, a movie was already released, the releasedate, the status (nuked or not) and more. Release databases are updated by automatic processes that either recurse selected topsites searching for new releases (spidering), or catch pre-release announcements from site channels.

Nukes 
If a group publishes a release which already has been released by another releasegroup, it's a dupe (duplicate). Then the release will be nuked. This means that it's marked as a bad release. Releasegroup try to avoid nukes, since this will give them a bad reputation. Except for dupe, releases can be nuked for other reasons too. First of all, there are 2 types of nuke:
- Global Nuke
Nuked because of the release itself. It is nuked because something is wrong with the release, for example: sound errors, dupe, freezing video, bad rip, etc. If a group realise there is something wrong, they can request a nuke. Common nuke releases:
» Dupe
» Bad aspect ratio
» Bad inverse telecine, the process of converting framerates was incorrect
» Interlaced, black lines on movement as the field order is incorrect
- Local Nuke
Nuked because of the environement. Individual sites will nuke for breaking their rules, for example: no telesyncs, no dvd's subbed in languages other then english and dutch, etc. So there is nothing wrong with the release. Because of these releases are nuked locally, they can still be traded on other sites.
--&gt;

==Pre network==
Pre network (aka Nukenet) is a collection of databases which share information about releases among the members of the network. There are approximately 20 different pre networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scenegrouplist.com/lists_nukenets.php |title=Incomplete list of Nukenets |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919153652/http://scenegrouplist.com/lists_nukenets.php |archivedate=2010-09-19 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://predb.in/database.txt|title=Network statistics|date=2011-09-18|work=PreDB.in|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105041227/http://predb.in/database.txt|archivedate=2012-11-05}}&lt;!--

==Pre database==
Each release that gets released will result as a record in a pre-database.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/27-years-of-warez-scene-release-info-leaked-in-giant-database/ |title=27 Years of Warez Scene Release Info Leaked in Giant Database

|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203004715/http://torrentfreak.com/27-years-of-warez-scene-release-info-leaked-in-giant-database/}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
This record will at least contain the time the release was released and the release name (the name of the folder that contains the files of the release).&lt;ref name="atssystem"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutthescene.com/thescene/system.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122030345/http://www.aboutthescene.com/thescene/system.html |archivedate=2007-01-22 |title=The scene / topsite system}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The size and nature of the release are often provided too.&lt;ref name="NfoKingz.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulli.com/news/1830-nfokingzorg-admins-im-interview-2009-05-15 |title=NfoKingz.org: Admins im Interview |trans-title=NfoKingz.org: Admins interview |language=German |work=[[Gulli.com]] |date=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nukes are linked with their release in these databases when a nuke is issued. To check if a release is nuked, a scener uses an IRC channel to query the database by typing commands. These IRC channels are called pre channels and are often not accessible for the general public.&lt;ref name="trac3.me"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://filenetworks.blogspot.com/2010/02/trac3me-public-predb-scene-release.html |title=TRAC3.ME – Public PreDB, Scene Release Index and Torrent Tracer |date=2010-02-25 |quote=Trace.M3 maintains a pre database that indexes hundreds of scene and p2p releases daily. However, T.ME's PreDB differs from those run by pure sceners  – first of all it's publicly accessibly by anyone. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708035652/http://filenetworks.blogspot.com/2010/02/trac3me-public-predb-scene-release.html |archivedate=2011-07-08 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The database is updated automatically through [[spidering]] topsites or by catching pre-release announcements from site channels.&lt;ref name="atssystem" /&gt;
The purpose of these different worldwide and mirrored pre databases is to check for fakes and that for example a music album or movie isn't pred more than once and thus reducing traffic.&lt;ref name="NfoKingz.org" /&gt;

=== List of public predb websites ===
There are now several public websites and IRC channels that list the contents of pre-databases. Most of them are regularly updated and show nuke reasons next to their release. They can be regularly down, very slow when searching or disappeared entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tarnkappe.info/nfo-sites-sterben-langsam-vor-sich-hin/ |title=NFO Sites sterben langsam vor sich hin |language=German |trans-title=NFO sites are slowly dying out in front of us |date=2015-07-05 |first=Lars |last=Sobiraj |website=Tarnkappe |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906192507/https://tarnkappe.info/nfo-sites-sterben-langsam-vor-sich-hin/ |archivedate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The server time is shown on some of them.

==Pre channel==
A pre channel is an [[IRC]] channel in which a [[Internet Relay Chat bot|prebot]] announces new warez (pre) releases in real time. Pre channels are generally provided as a convenience to members of the [[Warez scene|scene]], often in conjunction with a [[Topsite (warez)|topsite]]. Pre channels are typically private.

Advantages:
* Members of a pre channel are notified about new warez releases as they are released. This is of particular benefit to [[Topsite (warez)#Couriers|couriers]] and [[Warez group|release groups]].
* Pre channels commonly announce when a release is nuked or un-nuked.
* Pre channels provide a search facility that allows users to find out if a release exists, when it was released, and if it has been nuked. This function may also be used by release groups to avoid dupes (duplicates).
* Pre channels are also used for [[Topsite (warez)|topsites]] to measure how fast they received the release, otherwise known as the pretime.
Disadvantages:
* Pre channels are often supplied with events from other pre channels, so spam may spread quickly. Many prebots employ elaborate filters to ensure only valid release events are announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/shining-light-on-the-warez-darknet-a-scene-insider-speaks/ |title=TorrentFreak - Interview with a scene insider |date=2007-05-18 |author=enigmax |publisher=[[TorrentFreak]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707101123/http://torrentfreak.com/shining-light-on-the-warez-darknet-a-scene-insider-speaks/ |archivedate=2010-07-07 |deadurl=no}} Scener mentions bullshit nukes.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It just gives you the release name and no quality details, plot/features or links to downloads.&lt;ref name="rlslog_prechannel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rlslog.net/public-irc-pre-channel-and-how-to-use-it/ |title=Public IRC PRE Channel and How to use it |author=Martin |work=RlsLog.net |date=2008-08-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618104532/http://www.rlslog.net/public-irc-pre-channel-and-how-to-use-it/ |archivedate=2010-06-18 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prebot==
A prebot is commonly known as an automated script in IRC channels that announces new releases and can let users query its database to view past warez release dates and nukes, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/haaja/prebot&lt;/ref&gt; Another kind of prebot was adopted in 2000 due to the increased competition among release groups. This prebot automatically distributed new releases to affiliated [[Topsite (warez)|topsites]] of a group to release faster and more efficiently. This solved geographical and time zone related issues.&lt;ref name="rise-and-fall" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="856">Various state and local [[taxation|taxing authorities]] in the US require an employer or the employee to withhold and remit a tax on the [[wages]] paid to an employee.  Some states require both the employer and employee to remit a portion of the total '''occupational privilege tax''' (OPT), while others only require one or the other to do so.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.auroragov.org/AuroraGov/Departments/Finance/Taxes___Licenses/Taxes/Occupational_Privilege_Tax/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, it is a type of [[payroll tax]].  The genesis of this tax is the state’s claim in recovering [[accrued benefits]] provided to the taxpayer in enabling them to become employed and allowing for the state or [[municipality]] to further provide for taxpayers in the future.

$1 million in [[Bitcoin]] was seized, along with [[€]]180,000 in cash, gold, silver and drugs.&lt;ref name=europol/&gt; Of the 
"illicit services" that were initially claimed to have been shut down,&lt;ref name="takedown"/&gt; few were online marketplaces like Silk Road. A complaint filed on 7 November 2014 in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], "seeking the forfeiture of any and all assets of the following dark market websites operating on the Tor network", referred to just 27 sites, fourteen of which were claimed to be drug markets; the others allegedly sold counterfeit currency, forged identity documents or stolen credit cards.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/katevinton/2014/11/07/operation-onymous-dark-markets/|title=So Far Feds Have Only Confirmed Seizing 27 "Dark Market" Sites In Operation Onymous|work=Forbes|author=Kate Vinton|date=7 November 2014|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US and European agencies sought to publicise the claimed success of their six-month-long operation, which "went flawlessly".&lt;ref name=crypto/&gt;&lt;ref name=insider/&gt; The UK [[National Crime Agency]] sent out a [[Tweet (Twitter)|tweet]] mocking Tor users.&lt;ref name=crisis/&gt; The official [[Europol]] [[press release]] quoted a US [[Homeland Security Investigations]] official, who stated: "Our efforts have disrupted a website that allows illicit black-market activities to evolve and expand, and provides a safe haven for illegal vices, such as weapons distribution, drug trafficking and murder-for-hire."&lt;ref name=europol&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/global-action-against-dark-markets-tor-network|title=Global Action Against Dark Markets On Tor Network|publisher=Europol|date=7 November 2014|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=insider&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/police-shut-down-over-400-deep-web-sites-as-part-of-operation-onymous-2014-11?r=US|title=More Details Emerge Of How Police Shut Down Over 400 Deep Web Marketplaces As Part Of 'Operation Onymous'|work=UK Business Insider|author=James Cook|date=7 November 2014|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other leading drug markets in the [[Dark Web|Deep Web]] were unaffected, such as [[Agora (online marketplace)|Agora]], [[Evolution (online marketplace)|Evolution]] and Andromeda. Whereas Silk Road did not in fact distribute weapons, or offer [[contract killing]]s, Evolution did allow trade of weapons as well as drugs.&lt;ref name=dark&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/09/dark-web-evolution/|title=The Dark Web Gets Darker With Rise of the 'Evolution' Drug Market|work=Wired|author=Andy Greenberg|date=18 September 2014|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the closure of Silk Road 2.0, Agora already carried more listings than Silk Road, and Evolution was also expected to overtake it.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/06/the-fbi-promises-a-perpetual-futile-drug-war-as-it-shuts-down-silk-road-2-0/|title=The FBI promises a perpetual, futile drug war as it shuts down Silk Road 2.0|work=Washington Post|author=Christopher Ingraham|date=6 November 2014|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agora and Evolution are more professional operations than Silk Road, with more advanced security; the arrest of the alleged Silk Road manager is thought to have been largely due to a series of careless mistakes.&lt;ref name=crisis/&gt;&lt;ref name=dark/&gt;&lt;ref name=flaws&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/11/operation-onymous-flaws-tor|title=Operation Onymous may have exposed flaws in Tor, developers reveal|work=The Guardian|author=Alex Hern|date=11 November 2014|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tor 0-day exploit ==
The number of sites that police initially claimed to have infiltrated led to speculation that a weakness in the Tor network had been exploited. This possibility was downplayed by Andrew Lewman, a representative of the not-for-profit [[Tor project]], suggesting that execution of traditional police work such as following [[Bitcoin]]s&lt;ref name="overblown"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Dave|title=Dark net raids were 'overblown' by police, says Tor Project|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29987379|accessdate=22 August 2015|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wakefield|first1=Jane|title=Huge raid to shut down 400-plus dark net sites|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29950946|accessdate=9 August 2015|date=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crisis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/politics/tor-crisis-of-confidence/|title=The truth behind Tor's confidence crisis|publisher=The Daily Dot|author=Patrick Howell O'Neill|date=7 November 2014|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techspot.com/news/58751-operation-onymous-seizes-hundreds-darknet-sites-17-arrested.html|title=Operation Onymous seizes hundreds of darknet sites, 17 arrested globally|publisher=Techspot|author=Shawn Knight|date=7 November 2014|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewman suggested that such claims were "overblown" and that the authorities wanted to simply give the impression they had "cracked" Tor to deter others from using it for criminal purposes.&lt;ref name="overblown" /&gt; A representative of Europol was secretive about the method used, saying: "This is something we want to keep for ourselves. The way we do this, we can’t share with the whole world, because we want to do it again and again and again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=Global Web Crackdown Arrests 17, Seizes Hundreds Of Dark Net Domains|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/11/operation-onymous-dark-web-arrests/|accessdate=9 August 2015|date=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that hidden services could have been deanonymized if law enforcement replicated the research by [[CERT Coordination Center|CERT]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] up until the July 30th patch to mitigate the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gingold|first1=Naomi|title=Did the FBI Break Tor?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/12/silk_road_2_0_arrests_operation_onymous_did_the_fbi_break_tor.2.html|accessdate=9 August 2015|date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If sufficient relay nodes were [[DDOS]]ed, an attacker could perform traffic confirmation attacks in conjunction with a [[Sybil attack]], by forcing traffic to route over law enforcement controlled nodes, a theory partially supported by logs released by the administrator of [[Doxbin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Did Feds Use DDoS Attacks to Deanonymize Darknet Sites Seized in Operation Onymous?|url=http://leaksource.info/2014/11/11/did-feds-use-ddos-attacks-to-deanonymize-darknet-sites-seized-in-operation-onymous/|accessdate=9 August 2015|date=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Court documents released in November 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/court-docs-show-a-university-helped-fbi-bust-silk-road-2-child-porn-suspects|title=Court Docs Show a University Helped FBI Bust Silk Road 2, Child Porn Suspects|work=Motherboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; generated serious research ethics concerns in the Tor and security research communities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/11/why-the-attack-on-tor-matters/|title=Why the attack on Tor matters|work=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.torproject.org/blog/did-fbi-pay-university-attack-tor-users|title=Did the FBI Pay a University to Attack Tor Users?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the warrantless exploit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=19097|title=Tor Project claims FBI paid university researchers $1m to unmask Tor users|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which presumably had been active from February 2014 to July 4, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/attack-on-tor-has-likely-stripped-users-of-anonymity-1613247621|title=Attack on Tor Has Likely Stripped Users of Anonymity|author=Kate Knibbs|publisher=Gawker Media|work=Gizmodo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tor Project patched the vulnerability and the FBI denied having paid Carnegie Mellon $1 million to exploit it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/11/fbi-the-allegation-that-we-paid-cmu-1m-to-hack-into-tor-is-inaccurate/|title=FBI: "The allegation that we paid CMU $1M to hack into Tor is inaccurate"|work=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie Mellon also denied receiving money.&lt;ref&gt;https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2015/11/20/carnegie-mellon-denies-fbi-payment-for-tor-cracking-technique/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Schlechtriem''' (March 2, 1933 in [[Jena]] – April 23, 2007 in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]) was a German jurisprudential scholar.

==Biography==
Peter H. Schlechtriem was born March 2, 1933 in [[Jena]] (Germany) and studied law at the [[University of Hamburg]] and the [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität|Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg]]. After having passed both his State Examinations in law, he in 1964 received the title of Doctor iuris from the [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität|Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg]] for his dissertation on foreign inheritance law. In 1965 the [[University of Chicago Law School]] awarded him a Master of Comparative Law. Peter Schlechtriem subsequently returned to Freiburg where in 1970 he completed his Habilitation with a substantial book on the relationship between liability in contracts and tort, written under the supervision of [[Ernst von Caemmerer]].

In 1971 he was offered professorships at both the University of Erlangen and the [[University of Heidelberg]]. He accepted the chair in Heidelberg, where he headed the Institute for Foreign and International Private Law. In 1977, he accepted a professorship in Freiburg and became the successor of his academic teacher Ernst von Caemmerer. When being offered a chair by the [[University of Vienna]] (Austria) in 1984, he declined.

==Work==
Peter Schlechtriem's academic work focused on the law of contracts, comparative law and international uniform law. His two textbooks on the German law of contracts, contributions to commentaries and numerous articles have significantly influenced the development of the law in Germany and abroad. His article-by-article commentary on the 1980 Vienna Sales Convention (CISG), published both the German and in English, has been particularly successful. Peter Schlechtriem's writings have been translated into a number of languages.

Peter Schlechtriem served on numerous international commissions. He was a member of the German delegation at the Diplomatic Conference in Vienna that adopted the [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods]] in 1980. During the creation of the new Civil Codes of Estonia, Lithuania, Russia and Slovakia, he acted as a consultant and advisor. Peter Schlechtriem was a member if the Commission for the Reform of the German Law of contracts (Kommission zur Reform des deutschen Schuldrechts) and thus exercised considerable influence on the new general law of contracts and law of sales in force in Germany since 2002. He acted as a member of the German Council on International Private Law, of the [[UNIDROIT]] Working Group on the development of the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts 2004, of the Study Group for a European Civil Code and was an Advisor of both the [[American Law Institute]] and the [[National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform State Laws]] in the United States. 
From 1990 until 1997, Peter Schlechtriem was President of the German [[Gesellschaft für Rechtsvergleichung]]. He served as the first Chairman of the [[CISG Advisory Council]] (from 2001 until 2004).

==Honours and international recognition==
Peter Schlechtriem served as a Visiting Professor at the [[University of Chicago Law School]], [[Harvard Law School]], [[Victoria University of Wellington]], the [[University of Fribourg]] (Switzerland), the [[University of Zurich]] and [[Oxford University]]. In 1995 he received a ''Doctorate honoris causa'' from the [[University of Basle]], and in 2002 a ''Doctorate honoris causa'' from the [[University of Tartu]] (Estonia). He became a Fellow of [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St. Catherine’s College in Oxford]] in 2001. Peter Schlechtriem was a member of the [[International Academy of Comparative Law]]. On occasion of his 70th birthday in 2003, he was presented with a substantial [[Festschrift]].

[[Image:Red flag II.svg|thumb|[[Red flag (politics)|Red flags]] associated with [[marxism]]]]
'''Political symbolism''' is symbolism that is used to represent a political standpoint.  The symbolism can occur in various media including [[banners]], [[acronyms]], [[pictures]], [[flags]], [[mottos]], and countless more. For example, [[Red flag (politics)|Red flags]] have traditionally been flown by [[socialists]], [[left-wing]] radicals, and [[communist]] groups to represent the "blood of the workers". Black flags have traditionally been flown by [[anarchists|anarchism]], and [[left-wing]] radicals to represent the absence of all oppressive structures. A combination of the two colors in a black flag represents social anarchism, such as [[anarchist communism]] and [[anarcho syndicalism]].

Many groups use the [[political colour]] associated with their political philosophy, for example blue, particularly dark blue, is often associated with [[Conservative political parties|Conservative parties]].

Cultural groups may use symbols in what many consider to be a political way, for example [[LGBT symbols]] like the [[Rainbow flag]] are used to promote the political goal of [[LGBT]] rights.

'''Power harassment''' is [[harassment]] or unwelcome attention of a political nature, often occurring in the environment of a workplace including hospitals, schools and universities. It includes a range of behavior from mild irritation and annoyances to serious [[abuse]]s which can even involve forced activity beyond the boundaries of the job description. Power harassment is considered a form of illegal [[discrimination]] and is a form of political and [[psychological abuse]], and [[bullying]].

==By country==
===Japan===
Although the phenomenon power harassment is not uniquely Japanese, since it has occurred in many environments, the term is a Japanese coinage.  It has received significant attention in Japan in recent years as a workplace problem.&lt;ref&gt;''Rochelle Kopp'' (2012).[http://www.japanintercultural.com/en/news/default.aspx?newsid=167 Power Harassment], ''Japan Intercultural Consulting''&lt;/ref&gt; For many Japanese, the only kind of management style they have ever experienced is one in which subordinates are treated harshly and no complaints are tolerated.  This makes the nightmare boss seem normal, and those who have never had a different role model for management style find themselves falling back on the old methods.  And indeed, many Japanese admire authoritarian bosses, finding them to be strong and admiring their "passion" that may be expressed in angry outbursts.&lt;ref&gt;''Rochelle Kopp'' (2014). [http://www.japanintercultural.com/en/news/default.aspx?newsID=292 Power harassment – Japanese workplace bullying]. ''Japan Intercultural Consulting''&lt;/ref&gt;    The term itself was coined by Yasuko Okada in 2002&lt;ref&gt;''Yasuko Okada (岡田康子)'' [https://www.tokyo-jinken.or.jp/publication/tj_15_relay.html 職場で深刻化する「パワー・ハラスメント」]. In TOKYO JINKEN vol. 15. (Published 2002-09-20 by Tokyo Metropolitan Human Rights Promotion Center) (Available only in Japanese). &lt;/ref&gt; and is used mainly in Japan. It is analogous to "[[abuse of authority]]" or [[rankism]] in the workplace. Yuichiro Makiguchi is one of the researchers of power harassment at [[Tokoha Gakuen Junior College]] in Japan.

===South Korea===
{{main|Gabjil}}
The topic of power harassment is known in South Korea as [[Gabjil]], and it has been recently increasingly discussed in Korean media and scholarly works.

==Example==
Many workers are forced by their [[Superior (hierarchy)|superiors]] to perform tasks outside of their job description and [[working time|working hours]]. It is common for workers to be fired or suffer severe repercussions if they do not satisfy their superior's orders, despite there being no justifiable basis for such orders. 
Situations exist where employees are treated in a manner that far oversteps the bounds of what is proper between a boss and his or her workers. Someone in a position of power should never be allowed to exercise the power in a [[workplace bullying|bullying]] or discriminatory fashion. This can create an unhappy and unsafe work environment not just for those being harassed but for the entire work force. 
Typical examples of power harassment include: 
# being scolded in front of other colleagues, rebuked in a loud voice
# [[neglect]]
# false evaluation and demotion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1713">A '''privy examination''', or "separate examination", was a United States legal practice in which a married woman who wished to sell her property had to be separately examined by a [[judge]] or [[justice of the peace]] outside of the presence of her husband and asked if her husband was pressuring her into signing the document.  This practice, which emerged from English [[common law]], was seen as a means to protect married women's property&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awlaw3/property_law.html |title=Married Women's Property Laws |publisher=Law Library of Congress |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; from overbearing husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/marriedwomensproperty/a/property_1848ny.htm |title=Married Women's Property Act: 1848, New York State |author=Jone Johnson Lewis |accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of U.S. states continued to require privy examinations into the late 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1850">A '''Public Force''' is a force which has a legitimate and legalised use of physical force in order to serve the public interests. 

The term is broad and loosely defined. Public force could be used to refer to either police or military forces.

==Original use of the term==
The first use of the concept of a '''public force''', in French '''''Force Publique''''', is in the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] of 1789.'' 

'' '''Article XIII''' - For the maintenance of the public force and for the expenditures of administration, a common contribution is indispensable; it must be equally distributed between all the citizens, by reason of their faculties [i.e., ability to pay].''

The declaration sought to regulate the relationship between the citizen and the legitimate use of violence. In contrast to similar declarations of rights from [[Anglo-Saxon]] countries, the emphasis is on the citizen's duty to contribute to the existence of such a force, rather than on the citizen's rights vis-a-vis such a force.

==Further use of the term==
The concept was also used in other countries, e.g. in Thomas Jefferson's [[s:Thomas Jefferson's Sixth State of the Union Address|Sixth State of the Union Address]].

'''''Force Publique''''' was the title of the colonial army and gendarmerie of the [[Congo Free State]] and [[Belgian Congo]] from 1885-1960 (''see: '''[[Public Force (Congo)]]'''''). 

The term has been used as a designation for police or military forces in other countries, e.g. [[Panama]] and [[Costa Rica]], and is commonly used as a conceptual term in several countries, e.g. [[France]] and [[Morocco]].

A '''Public Lending Right (PLR)''' programme, is a programme intended to either compensate authors for the potential loss of sales from their works being available in [[public library|public libraries]], or as a governmental support of the arts, through support of works available in public libraries, such as books, music and artwork.

Twenty-eight countries have a PLR programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.plrinternational.com/faqs/faqs.htm#recognise |title="Public Lending Right (PLR) International Network website." |access-date=2009-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228224731/http://www.plrinternational.com/faqs/faqs.htm#recognise#recognise |archive-date=2014-02-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and others are considering adopting one.  [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], all the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Israel]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] currently have PLR programmes.  There is ongoing debate in [[France]] about implementing one.  There is also a move towards having a Europe-wide PLR programme administered by the [[European Union]].

The first PLR programme was initiated in [[Denmark]] in 1941. However, it was not properly implemented until 1946 due to [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | issn = 0024-2594
  | accessdate = 2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea spread slowly from country to country and many nations' PLR programs are quite recent developments.

==National variations==
PLR programmes vary from country to country.  Some, like Germany and the Netherlands, have linked PLR to [[copyright]] legislation and have made libraries liable to pay authors for every [[book]] in their collection.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}  Other countries do not connect PLR to copyright. For a nation like Canada or Australia the majority of funds would be going to authors outside the country, much of it to the United States, which is unpalatable to those nations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In Denmark, the current programme is considered a type of governmental support of the arts, not reimbursement of potential lost sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotekogmedier.dk/medieomraadet/biblioteksafgift-mv/biblioteksafgift-for-boeger/ Styrelsen for Bibliotek og Medier] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912014140/http://www.bibliotekogmedier.dk/medieomraadet/biblioteksafgift-mv/biblioteksafgift-for-boeger/ |date=2009-09-12 }} (Danish) 2009-08-19&lt;/ref&gt; Types of works supported are books, music, and visual artworks, created and published in Denmark, and available in public and school libraries.

===Payments===
How amounts of payment are determined also varies from country to country.  Some pay based on how many times a book has been taken out of a library, others use a simpler system of payment based simply on whether a library owns a book or not.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The amount of payments is also variable.  The amount any one author can receive is never very considerable.  In Canada for instance the payment is [[Canadian dollar|C$]]38.30 per book per library, with a maximum of C$2,681 (in 2008) for any one author in a year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} In the United Kingdom authors are paid on a per-loan basis calculated from a representative sample of libraries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} The current rate is 7.82 [[Pound sterling|pence]] per individual loan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bl.uk/britishlibrary/~/media/bl/global/services/plr/pdfs/newsletters/2017newsletter.pdf PLR News 2017 (British Library)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eligibility criteria===
Different countries also have differing eligibility criteria.  In most nations only published works are accepted, government publications are rarely counted, nor are [[bibliography|bibliographies]] or [[dictionary|dictionaries]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}  Some PLR services are mandated solely to fund literary works of [[fiction]], and some such as [[Norway]], have a sliding scale paying far less to [[non-fiction]] works.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}  Many nations also exclude scholarly and academic texts.

==EU directive==
Within the [[European Union]], the public lending right is regulated since November 1992 by [[directive 92/100/EEC]] on rental right and lending right. A report in 2002 from the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu.int/cgi-bin/eur-lex/udl.pl?REQUEST=Seek-Deliver&amp;COLLECTION=com&amp;SERVICE=eurlex&amp;LANGUAGE=en&amp;DOCID=502PC0502&amp;FORMAT=pdf Report from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on the public lending right in the European Union]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PDF), 2002-09-16
&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that many member countries had failed to implement this directive correctly.

The PLR directive  has met with resistance from the side of the [[International Federation of Library Associations]] (IFLA). The IFLA has stated that  the principles of 'lending right' can jeopardize free access to the services of publicly accessible libraries, which is the citizen's human right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifla.org/III/clm/p1/PublicLendingRigh.htm The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) Position on PLR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010081153/http://www.ifla.org/III/clm/p1/PublicLendingRigh.htm |date=2006-10-10 }} (April 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The PLR directive and its implementation in public libraries is rejected by a number of European authors, including Nobel Laureates [[Dario Fo]] and [[José Saramago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nopago.org/ |title=Campagna europea contro l'introduzione del prestito a pagamento in biblioteca (in Italian) |publisher=Nopago.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, more than 3000 authors signed a petition opposing PLR cuts in 2010.

'''The Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (War Restrictions) Act, 1915''' (Rent Restrictions Act) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which restricted increases in rent and the rate of mortgage interest during [[World War I]]. The Act was in place on 25 November 1915 with its restrictions retrospectively in place from 4 August 1914.&lt;ref name=RRA &gt;{{cite book|title=1914-16 The Public General Acts Passed in the Fifth and Sixth Years of the Reign of King George the Fifth; Being the Fifth Session of the Thirtieth Parliament of the United Kingdom and Ireland.|date=1916|pages=345–351|accessdate=10 January 2016|chapter=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was, in part,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Castells|first1=Manuel|title=The City and The Grassroots|date=1983|publisher=Edward Arnold|location=London|isbn=0-7131-6370-4|page=27|chapter=The Industrial City and the Working-Class: The Glasgow Rent Strike of 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; a result of a [[Red Clydeside#Rent Strikes|rent strike]] which had taken place in Glasgow between 1914&amp;ndash;15 as landlords sought to capitalise on the large influx of people into Glasgow that the promise of war and munitions work had brought into Glasgow. At its peak the rent strike involved as many as 20,000 people with its influence extending to other working-class communities in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burness|first1=Catriona|editor1-last=Gall|editor1-first=Gregor|editor2-last=Phillips|editor2-first=Jim|title=Remember Mary Barbour|journal=Scottish Labour History|date=2015|volume=50|page=85|publisher=The Scottish Labour History Society|issn=1472-6041}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis of the rent strike was brought to a head when Mr. Nicholson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Craig|first1=Maggie|title=When The Clyde Ran Red|date=2011|publisher=Mainstream|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-84596-735-2|page=115|chapter=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a factor in the Partick area of the city, sought the prosecution of eighteen strikers in the small debt court. On 17 November 1915, thousands of shipyard workers came out on strike and alongside what had become known as "Mrs Barbour's Army" descended on the court in Brunswick Place, Glasgow. Despite the possibility of further industrial unrest disrupting the supply of war munitions, the factor insisted on pursuing the case. Only when it was revealed that [[David Lloyd George]] had telephoned Nicholson's solicitor urging the prosecution to wait on the findings of a parliamentary Commission of Inquiry was the prosecution dropped. Within a month of the court case the Rent Restrictions Act was in place, and was designed to stop landlords from profiteering during the war years when housing demand was high and supply was low.&lt;ref name=HoC&gt;{{cite web|last1=Research Paper|title=The historical context of rent control in the private rented sector|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06747#fullreport|website=www.Parliament.UK|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=10 January 2016|date=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act was divided into five sections:
# Restrictions on raising rent or rate of mortgage interest
# Interpretation and application
# Rules as to procedure
# Application to Scotland and Ireland
# Short title and duration&lt;ref name=RRA /&gt;

The Act was initially intended as a temporary measure lasting during the continuance of the war and for a period of until six months after the end of the war.&lt;ref name=RRA /&gt; although certain sections were not actually repealed until 1989 when rents were deregulated during the third term of [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher#Third government 1987.E2.80.931990|Margaret Thatcher]]'s Conservative government.&lt;ref name=HoC /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38243">'''Renunciation''' is the voluntary act of relinquishing one's [[citizenship]] or [[nationality]]. It is the opposite of [[naturalization]]–whereby a person voluntarily acquires a citizenship, and is distinct from [[denaturalization]]–where the loss of citizenship is forced by a state.

==Historic practices==
The [[common law]] doctrine of perpetual allegiance denied an individual the right to renounce obligations to his sovereign. The bonds of subjecthood were conceived in principle to be both singular and immutable. These practices held on in varying ways until the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/alumni/uvalawyer/sp05/martin_lecture.htm|first=David A.|last=Martin|title=Dual Nationality: TR's 'Self-Evident Absurdity'|journal=UVA Lawyer|date=Spring 2005|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://history.uark.edu/OHR2011.pdf|first=Daniel|last=Rice|title=The 'Uniform Rule' and its exceptions: a history of Congressional naturalization legislation|journal=Ozark Historical Review|volume=40|year=2011|accessdate=2012-06-11|ref=harv|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305175501/http://history.uark.edu/OHR2011.pdf|archivedate=2013-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The refusal of many states to recognize expatriation became problematic for the United States, which had a large immigrant population. The [[War of 1812]] was caused partly by Britain's [[impressment]] of U.S. citizens born in the UK into the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy]]. Immigrants to the U.S. were sometimes held to the obligations of their foreign citizenship when they visited their home countries. In response, the U.S. government passed the [[Expatriation Act of 1868]] and concluded various treaties, the [[Bancroft Treaties]], recognizing the right to renounce one's citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Citizenship today: global perspectives and practices|author=Thomas Alexander Aleinikoff, Douglas B. Klusmeyer|publisher=Books.google.com|year=2001|isbn=978-0-87003-184-7|page=70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVnb-HA3K6sC&amp;pg=PA70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=I-Mien|last=Tsiang|title=The question of expatriation in America prior to 1907|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press|year=1942|oclc=719352|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] lists both the right to leave any country, including one's own (Article 13(2)) and the right to change one's nationality  (Article 15(2)), which implicitly recognizes the right to renounce citizenship.{{citation needed|date = July 2015}}

==In modern law==
Renunciation of citizenship is particularly relevant in cases of [[multiple citizenship]], given that additional citizenships may be acquired automatically and may be undesirable. Many countries have pragmatic policies that recognize the often arbitrary nature of citizenship claims of other countries and negative consequences, such as loss of [[security clearance]], can mostly be expected only for actively exercising foreign citizenship, for instance by obtaining a foreign passport. People from some countries renounce their citizenship to avoid [[Conscription|compulsory military service]]. However, some people may wish to be free even of the purely theoretical obligations and appearance of [[dual loyalty]] that another citizenship implies. Even in countries that allow dual citizenship, such as [[Australia]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Pakistan]], electoral laws demand that politicians not be under an obligation of allegiance to any foreign country, and so when politicians have been found to be violating such laws, they stepped down and renounced their other citizenships in response to the public controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/greens-senator-larissa-waters-resignation-triggers-wave-of-mps-declaring-australian-allegiance-20170718-gxdhzv.html|first=Amy|last=Remeikis|title=Greens senator Larissa Waters' resignation triggers wave of MPs declaring Australian allegiance|work=The Sydney Morning Hearald|date=2017-07-19|accessdate=2017-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/malik-suspended-from-senate-over-dual-nationality/article3490046.ece|first=Anita|last=Joshua|title=Malik suspended from Senate over dual nationality|work=The Hindu|date=2012-06-04|accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/JLP-PNP-dual-citizenship-deal_7812572|first=Paul|last=Henry|title=JLP–PNP dual citizenship deal|work=Jamaica Observer|date=2010-07-20|accessdate=2013-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example may be political refugees who would wish to renounce allegiance to the country from which they escaped. {{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Renunciation law in specific countries==
Each country sets its own policies for formal renunciation of citizenship. There is a common concern that individuals about to relinquish their citizenship do not become a [[stateless person]] and many countries require evidence of another citizenship or an official promise to grant citizenship before they release that person from citizenship. Some countries may not allow or do not recognize renunciation of citizenship or establish administrative procedures that are essentially impossible to complete.{{For example?}}

Mexico requires renunciation of all other citizenships as a condition of naturalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From migrants to citizens: membership in a changing world|author=Douglas B. Klusmeyer, Thomas Alexander Aleinikoff|page=19|isbn=978-0-87003-159-5|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel allows dual citizenship upon naturalization through the [[Law of Return]], but [[Knesset]] (Israeli parliament) members are required to renounce all foreign citizenships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/1.649065|title=Five new MKs must give up foreign citizenship|publisher=[[Haaretz]]|year=2015|accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=7193|title=Knesset tells dual-citizen MKs to ditch their foreign passports|publisher=[[Israel HaYom]]|year=2013|accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renunciation of citizenship is most straightforward in those countries which recognize and strictly enforce a single citizenship. Thus, voluntary [[naturalization]] in another country is considered as "giving up" of one's previous citizenship or implicit renunciation. For practical reasons, such an automatic renunciation cannot officially take place until the authorities of the original country are informed about the naturalization. In [[Japanese nationality law|Japan]], a formal report is required from the renouncing person to be submitted at an embassy. Germany actively investigates whether its citizens living abroad have naturalized there when they apply for a passport; for instance in Canada, German passport applicants have to submit a search of citizenship record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ottawa.diplo.de/Vertretung/ottawa/en/04/passports/UB_20passports.html |title=Embassy and Consulates General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Canada - Home |publisher=Ottawa.diplo.de |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada and Australia are signatories to the United Nations Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, and renunciation is possible only if it will not result in [[Stateless person|statelessness]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/applications/guides/CIT0302ETOC.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209175238/http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/applications/guides/CIT0302ETOC.html |date=December 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/pdf/128.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110223023/http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/pdf/128.pdf |date=January 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications for renunciation of citizenship need to be submitted in those countries with a waiting time of several months until approval.

===Nigeria===
The right to renounce Nigerian citizenship is established in § 29 of the 1999 [[Constitution of Nigeria]], which states that "any citizen of Nigeria of full age who wishes to renounce his/her Nigerian citizenship shall make a declaration in the prescribed manner for the renunciation", which the government is obliged to register except when Nigeria is physically involved in a war or when the [[President of Nigeria]] is of the opinion that the renunciation is contrary to public policy. Under § 29(4)(a), a person of either gender becomes "of full age" at eighteen years, while under § 29(4)(b) a girl younger than that is still deemed to be "of full age" if she is married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=179202|title=Constitution of the Republic of Nigeria|publisher=[[World Intellectual Property Organization]]|year=1999|accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Senate of Nigeria]] proposed a constitutional amendment to delete § 29(4)(b), which would have the effect that girls could only renounce Nigerian citizenship at the age of eighteen or older regardless of their marital status; the amendment passed by a vote of 75–14, two votes greater than the two-thirds [[supermajority]] required for the passage of constitutional amendments. However, after the vote, a [[point of order]] was raised against the amendment by Senate Deputy Minority Leader [[Ahmad Sani Yerima]] ([[All Nigeria Peoples Party|ANPP]]-[[Zamfara State|Zamfara]]), who stated that Schedule 2 of the Constitution prohibited the [[National Assembly of Nigeria]] from legislating on any matters relating to [[customary law|customary]] or [[Islamic law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nigeriapoliticsonline.com/david-mark-ahmed-yerima-exchange-hot-words-over-marriage-age/|title=David Mark, Ahmed Yerima exchange hot words over marriage age|work=Nigerian Politics Online|date=2013-07-17|accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources suggested that the amendment would have the effect of outlawing [[child marriage]], a matter of personal concern to Yerima due to his 2009 marriage to an Egyptian girl then only 13 years old. [[President of the Senate of Nigeria|Senate President]] [[David Mark]] was initially disinclined to permit a second vote on the matter, but relented after an argument. Yerima's arguments were sufficient to convince enough erstwhile supporters and non-voters to oppose the amendment; with a vote of 60–35, it was deprived of its supermajority and failed to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://premiumtimesng.com/news/141117-yerima-makes-senate-back-underage-marriage-as-lawmakers-oppose-local-government-autonomy.html|first=Ini|last=Ekott|title=Yerima makes Senate back underage marriage, as lawmakers oppose local government autonomy|work=[[Premium Times]]|date=2013-07-17|accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailyindependentnig.com/2013/07/senate-votes-against-direct-funding-to-lgs-6-year-tenure/|first=Celestine|last=Okafor|title=Senate votes against direct funding to LGs, 6-year tenure|work=Daily Independent|date=2013-07-17|accessdate=2013-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
Citizens of Singapore can only renounce Singaporean citizenship if they have acquired citizenship of another country. At the time of renunciation, renunciants must submit their [[Singaporean passport]]s and [[National Registration Identity Card]]s for cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.sg/sanfrancisco/SGrenounce.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502084643/http://www.mfa.gov.sg/sanfrancisco/SGrenounce.html|title=Items to note for renunciation|publisher=Singapore Consulate-General in San Francisco|date=2007-10-01|accessdate=2012-05-18|archivedate=2010-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Male Singaporeans generally cannot renounce citizenship until completing military service, though there are exceptions for those who emigrated at a young age (generally those who were not educated in Singapore).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/news_and_events/nr/2006/jan/16jan06_nr.html|title=Ministerial Statement on National Service Defaulters by Minister for Defence Teo Chee Hean|publisher=Singapore Ministry of Defence|date=2006-01-16|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a Hong Kong-born man who had acquired Singaporean citizenship by registration while a minor filed a lawsuit regarding this requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jakartaglobe.beritasatu.com/archive/hong-kong-born-teen-trying-to-give-up-singapore-citizenship/|first=K.

About 1,200 Singaporean citizens renounce their citizenship every year, a quarter of them naturalised citizens. Singapore does not permit [[multiple citizenship]] for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/2/29/asia/10821784&amp;sec=asia|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717234352/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2012/2/29/asia/10821784&amp;sec=asia|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-17|title=1,200 renounce their citizenship every year|work=The Star|date=2012-02-29|accessdate=2012-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of renunciants from 2001 to 2011 was roughly 10,900. Of these, roughly half were [[Chinese Singaporean]]s (who comprise about three-quarters of the population), while the rest were of other ethnicities such as [[Malays in Singapore|Malay]] or [[Indians in Singapore|Indians]] (who comprise about one-quarter of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://app4.mha.gov.sg/news_details.aspx?nid=MjcyNg==-jg0ohVz0UMM=|title=Written Reply to Parliamentary Questions on Renuniciation of Singapore Citizenship|publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs|date=2012-11-12|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Overview====
[[File:Certificate_of_Loss_of_Nationality_of_the_United_States.jpg|thumb|A Certificate of Loss of Nationality, issued to a former Citizen of the United States]]

Although renunciation may be the most commonly used term when referring to loss of U.S. nationality, renunciation is only one of the seven expatriating acts that may be performed voluntarily and with the intent to relinquish U.S. nationality stated in Section 349 of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] ({{usc|8|1481}}).&lt;ref name="Robert F.

United States law requires that an individual appear in person before a consular officer at a U.S. embassy or consulate outside the United States and sign an oath or affirmation that the individual intends to renounce U.S. citizenship. Exceptions to this rule are permitted in times of war and under special circumstances.&lt;ref name=statedept&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal-considerations/us-citizenship-laws-policies/renunciation-of-citizenship.html]|title=from the [[United States State Department]|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1481.html |title=8 U.S. Code § 1481 - Loss of nationality by native-born or naturalized citizen; voluntary action; burden of proof; presumptions &amp;#124; US Law |publisher=LII / Legal Information Institute (law.cornell.edu) |date= |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the expatriation procedure, the individual must complete several documents and demonstrate in an interview with a consular officer that the renunciation is voluntary and intentional. Depending on the embassy or consulate, the individual is often required to appear in person two times and conduct two separate interviews with consular officers over the course of several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://renunciationguide.com/Renunciation-Process-Step-By-Step.html |title=Renunciation Process Step-by-Step |publisher=Renunciationguide.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 235 renunciants in 2008,&lt;ref name="bloomberg20130809"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-09/americans-giving-up-passports-jump-sixfold-as-tougher-rules-loom.html|title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?|website=www.bloomberg.com|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 731 and 743 in 2009, and about 1485 in 2010;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/us/26expat.html?_r=1 "More American Expatriates Give Up Citizenship"], ''The New York Times'', April 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://renunciationguide.com/Data-On-Renunciants.html Data on Renunciations of U.S. Citizenship: A Web Guide] Data on renunciations, including analysis of the errors in the Federal Register lists.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, there were 1781 renunciants.&lt;ref name="cnn120511"/&gt; A total of 2,999 Americans renounced their citizenship in 2012-2013;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wood |first=Robert |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2014/02/06/americans-renouncing-citizenship-up-221-all-aboard-the-fatca-express/ |title=Americans Renouncing Citizenship Up 221%, All Aboard The FATCA Express |publisher=[[Forbes]] |date=2014-02-06 |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014, 3415 have renounced their USA citizenship or long term residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Saunders |first=Laura |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/record-number-gave-up-u-s-citizenship-or-long-term-residency-1423582726 |title=Record Number Gave Up U.S. Citizenship or Long-Term Residency |publisher=WSJ |date=2015-02-10 |accessdate=2015-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department estimates 5986 renunciants and 559 relinquishers during FY2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Documentation for Loss of Nationality |work=Schedule of Fees for Consular Services, Department of State and Overseas Embassies and Consulates-Passport and Citizenship Services Fee Changes |publisher=Office of the Federal Register |location=United States |date=2015-09-08 |url= https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/09/08/2015-22054/schedule-of-fees-for-consular-services-department-of-state-and-overseas-embassies-and#h-15 |accessdate=2016-03-24 |quote="The existing fee definition covers a projected 5,986 applicants renouncing their U.S. nationality in FY 2015.

Since 1998, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] has also maintained its own list of people who have renounced citizenship under {{USCSub|8|1481|a|5}}. This is one of the categories of people who are prohibited from purchasing firearms under the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]], and whose names must be entered in the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System]] (NICS) under the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]] of 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/general-information/fact-sheet |title=National Instant Criminal Background Check System: Fact Sheet |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1997-06-27/html/97-16900.htm |author=John W.

NICS covers a different population than the ''Federal Register'' expatriate list: the former includes only those who renounce U.S. citizenship, while the latter should include those who voluntarily lose citizenship by any means, and possibly certain former [[permanent residence (United States)|permanent residents]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giving Up US Citizenship:  Is it right for you?|url=http://www.usvisalawyers.co.uk/article14.html|website=Gudeon &amp; McFadden|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GlobalNews20140212"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1142010/did-exactly-3000-lose-u-s-citizenship-in-2013-maybe-but-data-is-suspect/ |first=Patrick |last=Cain |title=U.S. list of ex-citizens full of errors, duplication |work=Global News |date=2014-02-12 |accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fiscal year 2015, the State Department estimated there were 5,986 applications for renunciation of nationality, and forecast an additional 559 citizenship relinquishments. The discrepancy between this total of 6,545 compared to the 4,279 announced by the Treasury Department is speculated to be at least partly due to different counting of long-term green card holders, but no department of the government has released an official explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/expat/2015/09/16/is-the-irs-undercounting-americans-renouncing-u-s-citizenship/ |title=Is the IRS Undercounting Americans Renouncing U.S. Citizenship? |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Treasury Department published 1,151 names of people who expatriated in Q1 FY2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-05/pdf/2016-10578.pdf |title=Quarterly Publication of Individuals,  Who Have Chosen To Expatriate, as  Required by Section 603 |newspaper=Federal Register |date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For all of the year 2016, the published number of renunciants was 5,411, a 26% increase from 4,279 in 2015—a record high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Samuelson |first=Kate |title=Americans Renouncing Their Citizenship Is at a Record High |publisher=Fortune |date=2017-02-10 |url= http://fortune.com/2017/02/10/americans-renounce-citizenship/ |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Certificate of Loss of Nationality====
Formal confirmation of the loss of U.S. citizenship is provided by the [[Certificate of Loss of Nationality]] (CLN) and is received by the renunciant a number of months later.

As recently as November 2014, individuals renouncing US citizenship waited up to 6 months for the official certificate of renunciation, while many renunciants, particularly those who renounced in consulates not located in the most common European cities such as London and Zurich, were never provided with a CLN and were told that the statement signed at the oath of renunciation is the only form given. Unofficial statements by the US State Department ascribe the problems to the fact that before 2010, the system was not efficiently designed and consular officers often improvised their own procedures based on the rough guidelines in their instructions. Since the passage of FATCA, the large increase in renunciations led the Department of State to re-organize the process so it is clear and follows the same steps in all consulates, although as of 2016, a backlog of several months still exists in many consulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://renunciationguide.com/Renunciation-Process-Step-By-Step.html |title=Renunciation Process Step-by-Step |publisher=Renunciationguide.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Statelessness====
Although many countries require citizenship of another nation before allowing renunciation, the United States does not, and an individual may legally renounce U.S. citizenship and become stateless. Nonetheless, the [[United States Department of State]] warns renunciants that, unless they already possess a foreign nationality or are assured of acquiring another nationality shortly after completing their renunciation, they would become stateless and without the protection of any government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_776.html |title=U.S. State Department warnings to potential renunciants |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420135022/http://travel.state.gov/law/citizenship/citizenship_776.html |archivedate=2013-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://glr.com/cln |title=Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States (Stateless) |publisher=glr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one case, [[Vincent Cate]], an [[encryption]] expert living in [[Anguilla]], chose to renounce his US citizenship to avoid the possibility of violating US laws that may have [[export of cryptography in the United States|prohibited US citizens from "exporting" encryption software]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efc.ca/pages/media/nytimes.06sep98.html Peter Wayner, "Encryption Expert Says U.S. Laws Led to Renouncing of Citizenship"], ''The New York Times Sunday'', September 6, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

====Renunciation fee====
Renunciation of U.S. citizenship was free until July 2010, at which time a fee of $450 was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128414887 |title=Passport Fees Scheduled To Increase |publisher=NPR.org |date=July 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increase to $2,350, effective September 12, 2014, was justified as "reflective of the true cost" of processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fees for Consular Services to Change on September 12, 2014|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/231128.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=September 6, 2014|date=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2014/08/28/u-s-hikes-fee-to-renounce-citizenship-by-422/ |title=U.S. Hikes Fee To Renounce Citizenship By 422% |publisher=[[Forbes]] |date=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed a fee increase of approximately 220% in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/renouncing-u-s--citizenship-is-about-to-get-a-lot-more-expensive-150405883.html |title=Renouncing U.S. citizenship is about to get a lot more expensive |publisher=[[Yahoo News]] |date=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase took effect in January 2015.{{citation needed|reason=This statement is not supported by following citation -- January 2015 appears nowhere -- and it contradicts a previous sentence in this paragraph about it being effective Sept 2014|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/08/28/2014-20516/schedule-of-fees-for-consular-services-department-of-state-and-overseas-embassies-and#p-amd-2 |title=Schedule of Fees for Consular Services, Department of State and Overseas Embassies and Consulates-Visa and Citizenship Services Fee Changes |date=August 28, 2014| publisher=Office of the Federal Register |location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
On  October 26, 2015 [[Forbes]] reported that  during 2014, American [[dual citizens]] in Canada who were  trying to [[Renunciation of a United States citizenship|renounce their U.S. citizenship]] created a backlog at the [[U.S. Consulate in Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wood |first=Robert |title=Reverse Immigration: Americans Renounce Citizenship in Record Numbers |publisher=Forbes |date=2015-10-26 |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2015/10/26/reverse-immigration-americans-renounce-citizenship-in-record-numbers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Taxation====

People giving up U.S. citizenship may be subject to an [[expatriation tax]]. Originally, under the Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966, people determined to be giving up citizenship for the purpose of avoiding [[Taxation in the United States|U.S. taxation]] were subject to 10 years of continued taxation on their U.S.-source income, to prevent ex-citizens from taking advantage of special tax incentives offered to foreigners investing in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.senate.gov/library/reports/committee/download/?id=4ee7ee42-2874-4976-8161-00919c85e474|title=Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966; Presidential Election Fund Act; and other amendments|publisher=[[United States Senate Committee on Finance]]|date=1966-10-11|accessdate=2014-06-04|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] included various changes to the tax treatment of people who give up U.S. citizenship. First, it defined concrete criteria to determine whether an ex-citizen or ex-permanent resident was a "covered expatriate" presumed to have given up U.S. status for tax reasons, based on the person's income and assets, or inability to certify compliance with their tax filing and payment obligations for the past five years ({{USCSub|26|877|a|2}}). Second, it required the Department of the Treasury to "name and shame" people who give up U.S. citizenship by listing their names in the [[Quarterly Publication of Individuals Who Have Chosen to Expatriate]] in the ''[[Federal Register]]'' ({{USCSub|26|6039G|d}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=552730|first=Michael S.|last=Kirsch|title=Alternative Sanctions and the Federal Tax Law: Symbols, Shaming, and Social Norm Management as a Substitute for Effective Tax Policy|journal=Iowa Law Review|volume=89|issue=863|year=2004|accessdate=|ref=harv}} The provision in question is codified at {{USCSub|26|6039G|d}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The list does not appear to contain the names of all people who give up U.S. citizenship. though tax lawyers disagree whether that is because the list is only required to contain "covered expatriates", or due to bureaucratic errors or other reasons. Names of those renouncing in the last months of the year will mostly appear on the list before they have filed IRS form 8854 establishing covered or non-covered status, so it does not seem possible that the list is only required to contain covered expatriates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2014/05/03/americans-are-renouncing-citizenship-at-record-pace-and-many-arent-even-counted/|first=Robert|last=Wood|title=Record Numbers Renounce U.S. Citizenship — And Many Aren't Counted|work=Forbes|date=2014-05-03|accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/expat/2015/09/16/is-the-irs-undercounting-americans-renouncing-u-s-citizenship/|title=Is the IRS Undercounting Americans Renouncing U.S. Citizenship?|work=Wall Street Journal|date=2015-09-16|accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchel"&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://intltax.typepad.com/intltax_blog/2014/02/quarterly-list-of-expatriates-source-of-data.html|chapter=Quarterly List of Expatriates: Source of Data|title=International Tax Blog|publisher=Andrew Mitchel LLC, Attorneys at Law|date=2014-02-12|accessdate=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Advisor20130216"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.advisor.ca/news/industry-news/fbi-and-irs-differ-on-u-s-citizenship-data-107927|title=FBI and IRS differ on U.S. citizenship data|work=Advisor.ca|publisher=[[Rogers Media]]|date=2013-02-16|accessdate=2013-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]] included a provision, the [[Reed Amendment (immigration)|Reed Amendment]] ({{USCSub|8|1182|a|10|E}}), to bar entry to any individual "who officially renounces United States citizenship and who is determined by the Attorney General to have renounced United States citizenship for the purpose of avoiding taxation by the United States".

[[List of laws enacted during the 110th United States Congress|In 2008, Congress]] enacted the [[Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008|Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Act]], which changed the expatriation tax to a one-time mark-to-market worldwide capital gains tax rather than ten years of taxation on U.S.-source income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-110publ245/pdf/PLAW-110publ245.pdf |title=Info re United States "exit tax" |format=PDF |accessdate= 2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective June 2008, U.S. citizens who renounce their citizenship are subject under certain circumstances to an [[expatriation tax]], which is meant to extract, from the expatriate, taxes that would have been paid had he or she remained a citizen.

At the time of his death, he was Frank Henry Sommer Professor of Law and Philosophy at [[New York University]] and Professor of Jurisprudence at [[University College London]]. Dworkin had taught previously at [[Yale Law School]] and the [[University of Oxford]], where he was the Professor of Jurisprudence, successor to renowned philosopher [[H. L. A. Hart|H. L. A. Hart]]. An influential contributor to both [[jurisprudence|philosophy of law]]  and [[political philosophy]], Dworkin received the 2007 [[Holberg International Memorial Prize]] in the Humanities for "his pioneering scholarly work" of "worldwide impact."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/authors/90 "Ronald Dworkin"]. ''New York Review of Books''. Nybooks.com. Accessed 29 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a survey in ''[[The Journal of Legal Studies]]'', Dworkin was the second most-cited American legal scholar of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Fred R.|year=2000|title=The Most-Cited Legal Scholars|journal=Journal of Legal Studies|volume=29|issue=1|pages=409–426|doi=10.1086/468080}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his death, the Harvard legal scholar [[Cass Sunstein]] said Dworkin was "one of the most important legal philosophers of the last 100 years. He may well head the list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-15/the-most-important-legal-philosopher-of-our-time |title=The Most Important Legal Philosopher of Our Time |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2013-02-15 |accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His theory of [[law as integrity]] as presented in his book titled ''[[Law's Empire]]'', in which [[judge]]s interpret the law in terms of consistent moral principles, especially justice and fairness, is among the most influential contemporary theories about the nature of law. Dworkin advocated a "moral reading" of the [[United States Constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=yeUg-wglsK0C&amp;dq=ronald+dworkin Freedom's Law: The Moral Reading of the American Constitution]''.

He was a frequent commentator on contemporary political and legal issues, particularly those concerning the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], often in the pages of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.

==Early life and education==

Ronald Dworkin was born in 1931 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], United States, the son of Madeline (Talamo) and David Dworkin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/feb/14/ronald-dworkin|title=Ronald Dworkin obituary|last=Hodgson|first=Godfrey|date=2013-02-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family was Jewish. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1953 with an [[A.B.]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'', then attended [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], where he was a [[Rhodes Scholar]] and a student of [[Rupert Cross|Sir Rupert Cross]] and [[J.H.C. Morris]]. After he completed his final year's exams at Oxford, the examiners were so impressed with his script that the Professor of Jurisprudence (then [[H. L. A. Hart]]) was summoned to read it. He was awarded a B.A. with a [[Congratulatory first]]. Dworkin then attended [[Harvard Law School]], graduating in 1957 with an [[LL.B]] ''[[magna cum laude]]''.&lt;ref name="Liptak"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/us/ronald-dworkin-legal-philosopher-dies-at-81.html?pagewanted=all|title=Ronald Dworkin, Scholar of the Law, Is Dead at 81|first=Adam|last=Liptak|date=14 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then [[Law clerk|clerked]] for Judge [[Learned Hand]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]. Judge Hand would later call Dworkin "the law clerk to beat all law clerks"&lt;ref name="Liptak"/&gt;—and Dworkin would recall Judge Hand as an enormously influential mentor.&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, Ronald (1996), Freedom's Law: The Moral Reading of the American Constitution, Oxford: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-826470-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After clerking for Judge Learned Hand, Dworkin was offered the opportunity to clerk for Justice [[Felix Frankfurter]].&lt;ref name="Liptak"/&gt;  He turned down the offer and joined [[Sullivan &amp; Cromwell]], a prominent law firm in New York City.&lt;ref name="Liptak"/&gt; After working at the firm, Dworkin became a Professor of Law at [[Yale Law School]],&lt;ref name="Liptak"/&gt; where he became the holder of the [[Wesley N. Hohfeld]] Chair of Jurisprudence.

In 1969, Dworkin was appointed to the [[Professor of Jurisprudence (University of Oxford)|Chair of Jurisprudence at Oxford]], a position in which he succeeded H. L. A. Hart (who remembered Dworkins's Oxford examination and promoted his candidacy) and was elected Fellow of [[University College, Oxford]]. After retiring from Oxford, Dworkin became the [[Quain Professor]] of [[Jurisprudence]] at [[University College London]], where he subsequently became the Bentham Professor of Jurisprudence. He was Frank Henry Sommer Professor of Law at [[New York University School of Law]] and professor of Philosophy at [[New York University]] (NYU),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://its.law.nyu.edu/faculty/profiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=cv.main&amp;personID=19891|title=Ronald M.

He co-taught a colloquium in legal, political, and social philosophy with [[Thomas Nagel]]. Dworkin had regularly contributed, for several decades, to ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. He delivered the [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] Lecture at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], the Storrs Lectures at [[Yale University|Yale]], the Tanner Lectures on Human Values at [[Stanford University|Stanford]], and the Scribner Lectures at [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. In June 2011, he joined the professoriate of [[New College of the Humanities]], a private college in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nchum.org/who-we-are/the-professoriate |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608234526/http://www.nchum.org/who-we-are/the-professoriate |archivedate=2011-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisprudence and philosophy==
===Law as rule and principle===
Dworkin as a critic of HLA Hart's [[legal positivism]] has been summarized by the ''Stanford Encyclopedia'' which has stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Dworkin, as positivism's most significant critic, rejects the positivist theory on every conceivable level. Dworkin denies that there can be any general theory of the existence and content of law; he denies that local theories of particular legal systems can identify law without recourse to its moral merits, and he rejects the whole institutional focus of positivism. A theory of law is for Dworkin a theory of how cases ought to be decided and it begins, not with an account of the political organization of a legal system, but with an abstract ideal regulating the conditions under which governments may use coercive force over their subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/legal-positivism/|title=Legal Positivism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|publisher=Plato.stanford.edu|date=2003-01-03|accessdate=2013-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:RonaldDworkin.jpg|thumb|left|Ronald Dworkin in 2008]]

Dworkin is most famous for his critique of [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart's]] [[legal positivism]]; he sets forth the fullest statement of his critique in his book ''[[Law's Empire]]''. Dworkin's theory is '[[interpretivism (legal)|interpretive]]': the law is whatever follows from a constructive interpretation of the institutional history of the legal system.

Dworkin argues that moral principles that people hold dear are often wrong, even to the extent that certain crimes are acceptable if one's principles are skewed enough. To discover and apply these principles, courts interpret the legal data (legislation, cases etc.) with a view to articulating an interpretation that best explains and justifies past legal practice. All interpretation must follow, Dworkin argues, from the notion of "[[law as integrity]]" to make sense.

Out of the idea that law is 'interpretive' in this way, Dworkin argues that in every situation where people's legal rights are controversial, the best interpretation involves the right answer thesis, the thesis that there exists a right answer as a matter of law that the judge must discover. Dworkin opposes the notion that judges have a discretion in such difficult cases.

Dworkin's model of legal principles is also connected with Hart's notion of the [[Rule of Recognition]]. Dworkin rejects Hart's conception of a master rule in every legal system that identifies valid laws, on the basis that this would [[logical consequence|entail]] that the process of identifying law must be uncontroversial, whereas (Dworkin argues) people have legal rights even in cases where the correct legal outcome is open to reasonable dispute.

Dworkin moves away from [[legal positivism|positivism's]] separation of law and morality, since constructive interpretation implicates moral judgments in every decision about what the law is.

Despite their intellectual disagreements, Hart and Dworkin "remained on good terms."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===The right answer thesis===
In Dworkin's own words, his "right answer thesis" may be interpreted through the following words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose the legislature has passed a statute stipulating that "sacrilegious contracts shall henceforth be invalid." The community is divided as to whether a contract signed on Sunday is, for that reason alone, sacrilegious. It is known that very few of the legislators had that question in mind when they voted, and that they are now equally divided on the question of whether it should be so interpreted. Tom and Tim have signed a contract on Sunday, and Tom now sues Tim to enforce the terms of the contract, whose validity Tim contests. Shall we say that the judge must look for the right answer to the question of whether Tom's contract is valid, even though the community is deeply divided about what the right answer is? Or is it more realistic to say that there simply is no right answer to the question?&lt;ref&gt;Dworkin, 1985, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of Dworkin's most interesting and controversial theses states that the law as properly interpreted will give an answer. This is not to say that everyone will have the same answer (a consensus of what is "right"), or if it did, the answer would not be justified exactly in the same way for every person; rather it means that there will be a necessary answer for each individual if he applies himself correctly to the legal question. For the correct method is that encapsulated by the metaphor of Judge Hercules, an ideal judge, immensely wise and with full knowledge of legal sources. Hercules (the name comes from a classical mythological [[Hercules|hero]]) would also have plenty of time to decide. Acting on the premise that the law is a seamless web, Hercules is required to construct the theory that best fits and justifies the law as a whole ([[law as integrity]]) in order to decide any particular case. Hercules, Dworkin argues, would always come to the one right answer.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Dworkin does not deny that competent lawyers often disagree on what is the solution to a given case. On the contrary, he claims that they are disagreeing about ''the'' right answer to the case, the answer Hercules would give.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Dworkin's critics argue not only that ''law proper'' (that is, the legal sources in a positivist sense) is full of gaps and inconsistencies, but also that other legal standards (including principles) may be insufficient to solve a hard case. Some of them are [[commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]]. In any of these situations, even Hercules would be in a [[dilemma]] and none of the possible answers would be the ''right'' one.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Discussion of the right answer thesis===

Dworkin's metaphor of judge Hercules bears some resemblance to [[John Rawls|Rawls]]' [[veil of ignorance (philosophy)|veil of ignorance]] and [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]]' ideal speech situation, in that they all suggest idealized methods of arriving at somehow valid normative propositions. The key difference with respect to the former is that Rawls' veil of ignorance translates almost seamlessly from the purely ideal to the practical. In relation to [[politics]] in a [[democracy|democratic]] society, for example, it is a way of saying that those in power should treat the [[Opposition (politics)|political opposition]] consistently with how they would like to be treated when in opposition, because their present position offers no guarantee as to what their position will be in the political landscape of the future (i.e. they will inevitably form the opposition at some point). Dworkin's Judge Hercules, on the other hand, is a purely idealized construct, that is ''if'' such a figure existed, he would arrive at a right answer in every [[moral dilemma]]. For a critique along these lines see Lorenzo Zucca's ''Constitutional Dilemmas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Law/ConstitutionalLaw/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199204977|title=Oxford University Press: Constitutional Dilemmas: Lorenzo Zucca|publisher=Oup.com|accessdate=2013-02-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330082707/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Law/ConstitutionalLaw/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199204977|archivedate=2012-03-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dworkin's right answer thesis turns on the success of his attack on the skeptical argument that right answers in legal-moral dilemmas cannot be determined. Dworkin's anti-skeptical argument is essentially that the properties of the skeptic's claim are analogous to those of substantive moral claims, that is, in asserting that the truth or falsity of "legal-moral" dilemmas cannot be determined, the skeptic makes not a metaphysical claim about the way things are, but a ''moral'' claim to the effect that it is, in the face of epistemic uncertainty, unjust to determine legal-moral issues to the detriment of any given individual.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Moral reading of the Constitution===
In her recent book on [[Hans Kelsen]], Sandrine Baume&lt;ref&gt;Baume, Sandrine (2011). ''Hans Kelsen and the Case for Democracy'', ECPR Press, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; identified Ronald Dworkin as a leading defender of the "compatibility of judicial review with the very principles of democracy." Baume identified John Hart Ely alongside Dworkin as the foremost defenders of this principle in recent years, while the opposition to this principle of "compatibility" was identified as Bruce Ackerman and Jeremy Waldron.&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, Jeremy (2006). "The Core of the case against judicial review," ''The Yale Law Review'', 2006, Vol. 115, pp 1346–406.&lt;/ref&gt; Dworkin has been a long-time advocate of the principle of the moral reading of the Constitution whose lines of support he sees as strongly associated with enhanced versions of judicial review in the federal government.

===Theory of equality===
Dworkin has also made important contributions to what is sometimes called the ''[[egalitarianism|equality of what]]'' debate. In a famous pair of articles and his book ''Sovereign Virtue'' he advocates a theory he calls 'equality of resources'. This theory combines two key ideas. Broadly speaking, the first is that human beings are [[Moral responsibility|responsible]] for the life choices they make. The second is that natural endowments of intelligence and talent are [[moral luck|morally arbitrary]] and ought not to affect the distribution of [[Natural resource|resources]] in society. Like the rest of Dworkin's work, his theory of equality is underpinned by the core principle that every person is entitled to [[Social equality|equal]] concern and respect in the design of the structure of society. Dworkin's theory of equality is said to be one variety of so-called [[luck egalitarianism]], but he rejects this statement (''Philosophy and Public Affairs'', v. 31: 2).

===Positive and negative liberty===
In the essay "Do Values Conflict? A Hedgehog's Approach" (''Arizona Law Review'', Vol 43:2), Dworkin contends that the values of liberty and equality do not necessarily conflict. He criticizes [[Isaiah Berlin]]'s conception of liberty as "flat" and proposes a new, "dynamic" conception of liberty, suggesting that one cannot say that one's liberty is infringed when one is prevented from committing murder. Thus, liberty cannot be said to have been infringed when no wrong has been done. Put in this way, liberty is only liberty to do whatever we wish so long as we do not infringe upon the rights of others.

==Personal life and death==
While working for Judge Learned Hand, Dworkin met his future wife, Betsy Ross, with whom he would have twins Anthony and Jennifer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Betsy was the daughter of a successful New York businessman.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They were married from 1958 until Betsy died of cancer in 2000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-ronald-dworkin-legal-philosopher-acclaimed-as-the-finest-of-his-generation-8497540.html|title=Professor Ronald Dworkin: Legal philosopher acclaimed as the finest of his generation|first=Marcus|last=Williamson|date=15 February 2013|newspaper=The Independent|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dworkin later married Irene Brendel, the former wife of pianist [[Alfred Brendel]].

Dworkin died of [[leukemia]] in London on February 14, 2013 at the age of 81.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ronald Dworkin, Legal Scholar, Dies at 81|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2013/02/14/world/europe/ap-eu-britain-obit-dworkin.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;_r=0|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|author=The Associated Press|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/02/14/3233930/us-legal-scholar-ronald-dworkin.html|title=LONDON: US legal scholar Ronald Dworkin dies in UK aged 81|publisher=MiamiHerald.com|date=February 14, 2013|accessdate=2013-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by his second wife, two children, and two grandchildren.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/law-obituaries/9873847/Professor-Ronald-Dworkin.html|title=Professor Ronald Dworkin|date=15 February 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In September 2007, Dworkin was awarded the [[Holberg International Memorial Prize]]. The award citation of the Holberg Prize Academic Committee recognized that Dworkin has "elaborated a liberal egalitarian theory" and stressed Dworkin's effort to develop "an original and highly influential legal theory grounding law in morality, characterized by a unique ability to tie together abstract philosophical ideas and arguments with concrete everyday concerns in law, morals, and politics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holberg.uib.no/HP_prisen/en_hp_2007_dworkin.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330021554/http://www.holberg.uib.no/HP_prisen/en_hp_2007_dworkin.html |archivedate=2008-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York University]] [[NYU Annual Survey of American Law|Annual Survey of American Law]] honored Dworkin with its 2006 dedication.

In 2006, the Legal Research Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico honored Dworkin with the International Prize of legal Research "Dr. Héctor Fix-Zamudio".

In June 2000, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/v46/n27/commencement2K.html#r |title=COMMENCEMENT 2000: Honorary Degree Recipients - Almanac, Vol. 46, No. 27, 4/4/2000 |website=Upenn.edu |date=2000-04-04 |accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2009, he was awarded an honorary doctorate of law by Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/2009/06/05_dworkin.html |title=Ronald Dworkin ’57 receives honorary doctorate from Harvard - Harvard Law Today |website=Law.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2011, the [[University of Buenos Aires]] awarded Dworkin an honorary doctorate. The resolution noted that he "has tirelessly defended the rule of law, democracy and human rights."  These were among a number of honorary doctorates conferred upon him.&lt;ref name="otago.ac.nz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.otago.ac.nz/law/news/otago042519.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202201948/http://www.otago.ac.nz/law/news/otago042519.html |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 2012, he received the [[Balzan Prize]] for Jurisprudence in Quirinale Palace, Rome, from the President of the Italian Republic. The Balzan Prize was awarded "for his fundamental contributions to Jurisprudence, characterized by outstanding originality and clarity of thought in a continuing and fruitful interaction with ethical and political theories and with legal practices".

He was an honorary [[Queen's Counsel]] (QC).&lt;ref name="otago.ac.nz"/&gt;

'''Scientific jury selection''', often abbreviated '''SJS''', is the use of social science techniques and expertise to choose favorable [[jury|juries]] during a criminal or civil [[trial (law)|trial]]. Scientific jury selection is used during the [[jury selection]] phase of the trial, during which lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the [[Lawyer|attorney]]'s use of [[peremptory challenge]]s—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the [[Law of the United States|American legal system]].

Scientific jury selection is based on the work of Fred L. Strotbeck, the research director on the American Juries Project headed by Harry Kalvin, Jr and Hans Zeisel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Kalven |first = Harry, Jr. |first2 = Hans |last2 = Zeisel |last-author-amp = yes |year = 1966 |title =  The American Jury |location = Boston |publisher = Little, Brown and Company }}{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He considered juries to be small groups and taped mock juries in Chicago and St. Louis  and actual juries in Wichita, Kansas with the permission of the attorneys and judge but not the jurors.  The study revealed that the characteristics of individual jurors influenced jury deliberations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first = Fred L. |last = Strodtbeck |first2 = Rita M. |last2 = James |first3 = Charles |last3 = Hawkins |last-author-amp = yes  |title = Social Status in Jury Deliberations |work =  American Sociological Review |volume = 22 |issue = 6 |date = December 1957 |pages = 713-719 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SJS has roots in criminal trials during the [[Vietnam War]] era, but in modern times is usually employed in high-stakes civil litigation (where only money is usually at issue, in contrast to criminal trials, where the defendant can go to prison). SJS practitioners determine what background characteristics and attitudes predict favorable results, and then coordinate with attorneys in choosing the jury. Studies are mixed as to the effectiveness of the practice, though it is clear that the evidence presented at trial is the most important determiner of verdicts (the trial result) and that SJS is more likely to have an impact where that evidence is ambiguous. SJS's potential to unfairly skew the jury has led to some reform proposals, but none have yet been implemented. The limited fictional portrayals of SJS have been negative towards the practice.

==History and use==
[|Former Attorney General [[Ramsey Clark]] rated jurors and led the discussion among defendants, attorneys, and social scientists about jury selection in the Harrisburg Seven case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first = Jay |last = Schulman |display-authors = etal |date = May 1973 |title = Recipe for a Jury |work = [[Psychology Today]] |page = 41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During [[jury selection in the United States]], attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option is a ''[[challenge for cause]]'', in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second option is a [[peremptory challenge]], where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have a limited number of peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-[[capital crime|capital]] [[felony]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Mariana |first = G. |year = 1975 |title = Peremptory challenge—divining rod for a sympathetic jury? |work = The Catholic Lawyer |volume = 21 |pages = 68–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorneys have long used peremptory challenges to exclude "undesirable" prospective jurors, but have not always been successful at identifying these. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Plutchik |first = R. |last2 = Schwartz |first2 = A. K. |last-author-amp = yes  |year = 1965 |title = Jury Selection: Folklore or science? |work = Criminal Law Bulletin |volume = 1 |pages = 3–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 [[Joan_Little#The_trial|Joan Little trial]], defense attorneys used an [[astrology|astrologer]] to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 [[Harrisburg Seven]] trial.&lt;ref name=Hutson/&gt; During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' subscribers would be better for the prosecution.&lt;ref name=Hutson&gt;{{cite magazine |first = Matthew |last = Hutson |url = http://psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20070302-000001.html |title = Unnatural Selection |date = March–April 2007 |work = [[Psychology Today]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.

[[File:O.J. Simpson (1986) cropped.jpg|thumb|right|100px|The [[O. J. Simpson]] murder trial was marked by efforts to choose a friendly jury.]]
A jury consultant helped pick the jury in the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O. J. Simpson murder trial]]. [[Criminology|Criminologist]] Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a [[Jury questionnaire|questionnaire]] and response and body language during [[voir dire]] (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Linder |first = Douglas O. |year = 2000 |url = http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/Jurypage.html#Selection%20of%20the |title = The O.

Simpson Trial: Selection of the Jury |access-date = July 14, 2006 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110209115654/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/Jurypage.html#Selection%20of%20the |archivedate = February 9, 2011 |df = mdy-all }}{{full|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutor [[Vincent Bugliosi]] gives more credit to the traditional [[change of venue]]. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Vincent |last = Bugliosi |year = 1997 |title = Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O.J. Simpson Got Away With Murder. |location = |publisher = Island Books |pages = 56-64 |isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor dismissed her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process.&lt;ref name=Hutson /&gt;

Contemporary jury consultants are often sociologists, people with experience in communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently [[psychology|psychologists]] who specialize in [[legal psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite magazine |last = Strier |first = Franklin |first2 = Donna |last2 = Shestowsky |last-author-amp = yes |year = 1999 |title = Profiling the profilers: a study of the trial consulting profession, its impact on trial justice, and what, if anything, to do about it |work = Wisconsin Law Review |pages= 441+, at 445 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in [[tort]]s (civil litigation),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Strier|Shestowsky|1999|pp=450-51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested large sums of money in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury and [[trial consulting]] firms have emerged, earning multi-million dollar revenues, mostly from such high-stakes [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] [[Lawsuit|litigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first = Gary |last = Moran |first2 = Brian L. |last2 = Cutler |first3 = Anthony |last3 =De Lisa |last-author-amp = yes  |title = Attitudes Toward Tort Reform, Scientific Jury Selection, and Juror Bias: Verdict Inclination in Criminal and Civil Trials |year = 1994 |work = Law and Psychology Review |volume = 18 |pages = 310–1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book |last = Kressel |first = Neil J. |first2 = Dorit F. |last2 = Kressel |last-author-amp = yes |year =2004 |title = Stack and Sway: The New Science of Jury Consulting |location = Boulder, CO |publisher = Westview Press |isbn = 978-0-8133-9772-6 |ref = harv |pages = 79-81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written extensively about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in the jury system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Abramson |first = Jeffrey |year = 1994 |title = We, the Jury: The Jury System and the Ideal of Democracy |location =  New York |publisher = BasicBooks |pages = 153-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
The theory behind SJS is that juror attitudes predict voting preferences most effectively. By discovering what relationships exist between certain attitudes, attorneys can exclude those from the jury whose attitudes would predispose them to an unfavorable verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Lieberman |first = Joel D. |last2 = Sales |first2 = Bruce D. |last-author-amp = yes |year = 1996 |title = Scientific Jury Selection |location = |publisher = American Psychological Association |page =  |isbn = }}{{full|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Researcher Shari Diamond indicates that jury consultants primarily rely on two methods: telephone surveys and mock trials (trial simulations).&lt;ref name=Diamond&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Diamond |first = S. S. |year = 1990 |title = Scientific Jury Selection: What Social Scientists Know and Do Not Know |work = Judicature |volume = 73 |pages = 180–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Telephone [[Statistical survey|surveys]] are the practitioners' "primary research method". During a survey of the community where the trial is taking place, jury consultants ask about:

# background characteristics of the jury pool such as race, sex, marital status, age, income, and job; and perhaps more specific questions that depend upon the case itself;
# beliefs and attitudes likely associated with a favorable or unfavorable verdict; and
# (after reading a summary of the facts of the case) which verdict the survey respondent would favor.

[[File:Jury selection - Faulk.jpg|thumb|220px|right|An attorney asking questions during [[jury selection]].]]
Diamond writes that jury consultants then compare the three data sets to determine which background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and verdicts, and which attitudes correlate to favorable verdicts. Attorneys can then use that information to select favorable jurors, based either on prospective jurors' characteristics or whatever an attorney can learn about jurors' attitudes. This has prompted the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with favorably biased or credulous jurors; in turn, practitioners insist this is impossible and that bias can only be removed from a jury pool.&lt;ref name=Diamond /&gt;

An alternative is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with [[opening statements]] or a full-blown [[mock trial]] instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher cost of a mock trial allows for a more realistic portrayal of the real trial and (researchers hope) more accurate data. It also provides a better opportunity to question the subjects, before and after the trial simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more representative sample of the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both methods have advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case.&lt;ref name=Diamond /&gt;

Besides the occasional astrologer or psychic, a few practitioners use unorthodox methods, such as in-courtroom assessment of posture, pupil dilation, or breathing to judge jurors both during selection and during trial. Though such methods have the veneer of science, psychologists reject them as nonsense and "science fiction".&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book |last = Kassin |first = Saul M. |first2 = Lawrence S. |last2 = Wrightsman |last-author-amp = yes |year = 1988 |title = The American Jury on Trial: Psychological Perspectives |location = Bristol, PA |publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn = 978-0-89116-856-0 |ref = harv |page = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding this, Jo-Ellan Dimitrius (from the Simpson trial) indicates that she also relies on appearance, body language, conduct, and even smells such as perfume or medication. She sometimes decides based upon her "gut feeling" about a juror.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kressel|Kressel|2004|pp= 94–5}}; the Kressels are repeatedly quoting from {{cite book |first = Je-Ellan |last = Dimitrius |title = Reading People |location = Ballantine |year = 1998}}{{full|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research psychologists Kassin and Wrightsman indicate that the model employed (demographic factors predict attitudes that predict verdicts) has empirical weaknesses. That attitudes predict verdicts is taken for granted and rarely studied. For example, veterans might favor current troops, but that does not necessarily translate into a likelihood to acquit their brethren of crimes. However, the relationship between demographics and verdicts can be more reliably predicted by mock trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kassin|Wrightsman|1988|p= 61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Successful prediction of jury verdicts often requires data specific to the case and jurisdiction. The sheer number of ways that one case can be unique outstrips the published research on the subject, so [[original research]] is often required. That necessity is exacerbated by the fact that many modern consultants are reluctant to share knowledge, even with other firms, because of paranoia, client confidentiality, and their regard for their work as "[[trade secrets]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kressel|Kressel|2004|p= 76}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One important variation is "group dynamics analysis". Some jury selection is concerned with the attitudes and bias of individuals. Some trial consultants also try to predict how individuals will form themselves into groups in the jury and which jurors will become leaders and followers in those groups. Consultants also use this tool after jury selection is over.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Strier|Shestowsky|1999|p= 455}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy==
Although advocates and practitioners of scientific jury selection claim the practice is overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The results indicated that the juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Diamond |first = S.S. |last2 =  Zeisel |first2 = H. |last-author-amp = yes |year = 1974 |title = A courtroom experiment on juror selection and decision-making |work = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume = 1 |pages =  276–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another simplified experiment indicated that lawyers trained in a systematic selection method made better predictions of juror verdicts in two of four cases – the sale of illegal drugs and a military court-martial (the other two cases were murder and drunk driving). The systematic method was more effective in those two cases where the predictive relationships between demographic variables and attitudes/verdicts were strongest, and least effective where such predictive relationships were weak or nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first = Irwin A |last = Horowitz |year = 1980 |title = Juror Selection: A Comparison of Two Methods In Several Criminal Cases |magazine = Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume = 10 |issue = 86 |page = }}{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academic researchers argue that the actual efficacy of SJS is obscured by poor research [[methodology]]. Specifically, demographic characteristics used to predict juror attitudes and juror verdicts may not hold true across all types of cases. For example, men convict more frequently than women in some types of criminal trials but less frequently in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Shell |first = Roberta Wyper |title = Scientific Jury Selection: Does It Work? |work = Barrister |date = Summer 1980 |page=  47}} Citing {{harvp|Mills|Bohannon|1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this, demographic characteristics are often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kressel|Kressel|2004|p= 105}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual efficacy of jury consultants may not be very important because the demographic composition of the jury has little effect on the verdict it renders, usually causing only a 5%–15% variance in verdicts.&lt;ref name=FP&gt;{{cite magazine |first = Solomon M. |last = Fulero |first2 =Steven D. |last2 = Penrod |last-author-amp = yes  |year = 1990 |title = Attorney Jury Selection Folklore: What Do They Think And How Can Psychologists Help? |work = Forensic Reports |volume = 3 |pages = 251, 252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Mills |first = C. J. |last2 = Bohannon |first2= W. E. |last-author-amp = yes  |year =1980 |title = Juror characteristics: To what extent are they related to jury verdicts? |work = Judicature |volume = 64 |pages = 22–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence presented at trial has far more impact on what the verdict will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kassin|Wrightsman|1988|p= 61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Kressel and Kressel indicate, "when the evidence is strong, nothing else matters much" and even when the evidence is ambiguous, demographic characteristics of jurors are a relatively minor influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kressel|Kressel|2004|p= 105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers argue that a significant improvement in jury selection, however small, may be worthwhile when the stakes are high, as with a defendant accused of a capital crime or a corporation that stands to lose millions of dollars in a civil suit.&lt;ref name=FP /&gt;

A popular "proof is in the pudding" argument is often made, especially by consultants themselves; the argument goes that since attorneys and clients pay such high fees (sometimes as much as $500,000) for consultants, their services must be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Jonakait |first = Randolph N. |year = 2003 |title = The American Jury System |location = New Haven, CT |publisher = Yale University Press |isbn = 978-0-300-12463-7 |ref = harv |page = 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shell|1980|p= 47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that most attorneys are unaware of the social science research on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jonakait|2003|p= 160}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of scientific jury selection has also been comparison tested against other methods, such as attorney folklore and intuition. For trial attorneys, justifying the expense of SJS is contingent upon an improvement over their own jury selection abilities. Several empirical studies of traditional jury selection (by attorneys acting alone) have indicated that it and SJS are about equally effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Robert |last = Macon |year = 2000 |chapter = Inside the Black Box: What Empirical Research Tells Us about Decisionmaking by Civil Juries |editor-first = Robert E. |editor-last = Litan |title = Verdict: Assessing the Civil Jury System |location = Washington D.C. |publisher = The Brookings Institution |page = 151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last = Broeder |first = D. W. |year = 1965 |title = Voir dire examination: An empirical study |work = Southern California Law Review |volume = 38 |issue = 744–61 |page =  528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suggested reforms==
In light of the criticisms leveled against scientific jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and increases the influence of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;''[[Batson v. Kentucky]]'' (1986) is the seminal case in this area, finding race-based use of peremptory challenges by prosecutors unconstitutional. ''[[Georgia v. McCollum]]'' (1992) extended the same prohibition to defense attorneys. The relevant precedents in civil law are ''[[Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company]]'' (1991) (regarding race) and ''[[J.E.B. v. Alabama]]'' (1994) (regarding gender).&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a [[challenge for cause]] argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly in the context of a limited voir dire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Strier|Shestowsky|1999|pp= 483–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other proposals include:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jonakait|2003|pp+ 163–5, 170–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''lower the number of peremptories'' to force attorneys to use them only on the most clearly biased jurors and severely curtail their ability to "shape" the jury with peremptory challenges.
*''ban jury consulting'' through legislative action, though it may be impossible to fairly draw a line that excludes SJS but doesn't exclude advice from other attorneys in the same firm, for example.
*''limit useful information'' by severely curtailing verbal questioning and written questionnaires of prospective jurors. This may have the perverse effect of encouraging many erroneous [[Batson v. Kentucky#Batson in modern law|Batson challenges]] based solely on race or gender instead of more sophisticated metrics of bias.
*''prohibit investigation'' of the jury pool or release the list of prospective jurors on the eve of jury selection to make investigation of prospective jurors impossible.
*''force disclosure'' of consultant use by making surveys of prospective jurors or the community [[Discovery (law)|discoverable]] by (legally accessible to) the opposing party. If consultants' research is discoverable, each party could use and benefit from their research.

Despite serious discussion among lawyers, scholars, legislators, and others about various reform proposals, none have been implemented and no consensus exists about which remedy, if any, would be the most appropriate and effective.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{harvp|Strier|Shestowsky|1999|pp= 480-495}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
The major fictional representations to date have largely portrayed jury consultants as villains that are highly effective at influencing the jury, often using illegal tactics that mainstream practitioners do not use. Consultants are major characters in [[John Grisham]]'s novel ''[[The Runaway Jury]]'' and the similar [[Runaway Jury|film adaptation]]. In the film, Rankin Fitch, "jury consultant for the defense", leads a team that uses high technology and sometimes-illegal tactics to prevent a judgment against their corporate client in what ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]'' calls "our worst nightmare of corporate arm-twisting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Charles |last = Taylor |url = http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/movies/review/2003/10/17/runaway/index.html |title = Runaway Jury |work = [[Salon.com|Salon]] |date = October 17, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about the book, Kressel and Kressel say Grisham "plays on fears that the American justice system has been hijacked by crafty attorneys and immensely effective hired-gun social scientists".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kressel|Kressel|2004|p= 71}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Jean Hanff Korelitz's ''A Jury of Her Peers'' stretches the known reality of consulting much further. Korelitz's fictional consultants are part of an unscrupulous firm that charges prosecutors to kidnap homeless people, program them with drugs into conviction-only jurors, and substitute them for those hoping to avoid jury duty. Jonakait says the novel is "hardly realistic" but "reveals the distrust engendered by jury consultants".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jonakait|2003|p= 163}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a fifth-season episode of the [[CBS]] television series ''[[Numb3rs]]'', entitled "Guilt Trip", an [[arms trafficking|illegal arms dealer]] ([[James Marsters]]) is tried for [[racketeering]] and the murder of the key witness against him. After he is unexpectedly acquitted, the investigation reveals that he had hired a sleazy jury consultant to not only identify those jurors who would most likely sway the rest of the jury's deliberations, so as to [[bribery|bribe]] and [[extortion|extort]] them into pushing for acquittal, but also train one of his henchmen to pose as the perfect "prosecutor's juror" and get placed on the jury. In [[List_of_Leverage_episodes#Season_1_.282008.E2.80.932009.29|season one, episode eleven]], of the television series ''[[Leverage (TV series)|Leverage]]'', a pharmaceutical company is under fire for a wrongful death case involving a stimulative all-natural herbal supplement. In an attempt to prevent major losses for the pharmaceutical company in question, and to protect the investment of a soon-to-be-parent company's subsidiary, scientific jury selection is used. However, the ''Leverage'' team thwarts their efforts every step of the way, similar to a giant chess match.

In the CBS television show ''[[Bull (2016 TV series)|Bull]]'', the lead character operates a trial analysis company, which specializes in utilizing psychological profiles built by observing jurors during voir dire and online profiles to both select the jury and try arguments against mirror jurors.  The show is based on the early career of [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil McGraw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cbs.com/shows/bull/about/ |title = About ''Bull'' |publisher = [[CBS]] |access-date = October 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999''' is a [[statutory instrument]] of the United Kingdom government, defining "the boundaries between waters which are to be treated as internal waters or territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland and those which are not." It was introduced in accordance with the [[Scotland Act 1998]], which established the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]].

==Defining jurisdictions==
The territorial waters thus defined as Scottish waters come under the [[jurisdiction]] of [[Scots law]], and are also used for defining the area of operation of [[Marine Scotland]], the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]], and other [[Scottish Government]] agencies and [[Scottish public bodies|public bodies]]. This is, for example, of importance to the [[Scottish fishing industry]], the [[North Sea oil]] industry, and in the competing claims for the resources of the [[Rockall Trough]].

The territorial waters thus defined as ''not'' being Scottish waters come under the jurisdiction of either [[English law]] or [[Northern Ireland law]]. Therefore, because it defines the territorial limits of the three separate [[jurisdiction (area)|jurisdiction]]s, it comprises a piece of [[constitutional law]] in the [[constitution of the United Kingdom]].

==Changes==

The law effectively curved the maritime jurisdictional boundary between Scotland and England north. Previously, the boundary was a straight line heading east across the North Sea from [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]]. The movement of the line meant that some oil fields previously in Scottish waters were now under English jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20042070|date=16 April 2013|accessdate=2016-09-21|title=Who has a right to claim North Sea oil?|last=Brocklehurst|first=Steven|website=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Alex Kemp of the [[University of Aberdeen]] argued that the movement of the line did not make much difference from an economic perspective, "because [these] are just a handful of fields, and [no longer] very important ones".&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seeds of Hope''' was a [[Plowshares Movement|plowshares]] group of women who damaged a [[BAE Hawk]] fighter jet at the [[BAe Systems|British Aerospace]] [[Warton Aerodrome]] site near [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], England, in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i4aFpr6uoWEC&amp;pg=PA274|page=274|title=Strategies for Social Change|editor=Gregory M. Maney|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|isbn=978-0816672899|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they stated in the explanatory video film left in the aircraft after their attack, they wanted to inspire hope instead of violence and greed, hence their choice of name. The group was also called the "Warton Four."&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:jCOpHwmTlhsJ:www.abolishwar.org.uk/downloads/SongsForEducation.pdf+%22warton+four%22&amp;hl=sv&amp;gl=se&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgvcX_VUddz8dgHYv3K6zI87voXVcYOIaTVzJoM2bCrmCH645moBFaSis8tZ8hQjHfkJ-V6tSUDtK66zzpi8QPGHtShc4_33dwoK1Q1J4tdGovaxn9cumTS1k1plEvIDdXWJ__O&amp;sig=AHIEtbSgRfQE5IvJSBpRwetZGBqlwuI5uA Movement for the Abolition of War - SONGS WITH 'AN ATTITUDE' ABOUT WAR p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Direct action==

On the 29 January 1996, Andrea Needham, Joanna Wilson and Lotta Kronlid broke into BAe's Warton Aerodrome at Warton and caused £1.7m worth of damage to [[BAe Hawk]] [[Aircraft registration|tail number]] ZH955, a training aircraft that was to have been supplied, along with 23 other jets, to the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] regime of [[Indonesia]].

==Trial==
Accused of causing, and conspiring to cause, criminal damage, with a maximum ten-year sentence, they argued that what they did was not a crime but that they ''"were acting to prevent British Aerospace and the British Government from aiding and abetting genocide"''. Meaning the one taking place in [[East Timor#History|East Timor]]. They were found not guilty of criminal damage at [[Liverpool Crown Court]], after a jury deemed their action was reasonable under the [[Genocide Act 1969]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/campaigners-face-jail-for-raid-on-military-jet-1329683.html Campaigners face jail for raid on military jet - Home News, UK - The Independent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Stanford Environmental Law Journal''''' is a student-run [[law review]] published at [[Stanford Law School]] that covers [[natural resources law]], [[environmental policy]], [[law and economics]], [[International law|international environmental law]], and other related disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Stanford Environmental Law Journal}}, [http://journals.law.stanford.edu/stanford-environmental-law-journal-elj/ Homepage].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The journal was established in 1978 as the ''Stanford Environmental Law Annual'' to "provide a forum for student papers in developing areas of environmental law."&lt;ref&gt;''Forward'', 1 {{smallcaps|Stan. Envtl. L. Ann.}} i (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; After a three-year hiatus between 1983 and 1986, the journal resumed publication as the ''Stanford Environmental Law Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;''President's Page'', 6 {{smallcaps|Stan. Envtl. L. J.}} 1 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2016 [[Washington and Lee University]] Law Journal Rankings, the journal was the second-highest rated environmental, natural resources, and land use law journal by [[impact factor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawlib.wlu.edu/LJ/index.aspx "Law Journals: Submission and Ranking, 2008-2015,"] Washington &amp; Lee University (Accessed: September 25, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Articles in the journal have been cited by many [[state supreme courts]]&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Peace v. Northwestern Nat'l Ins. Co.'', 228 Wis. 2d 106 (1999); ''Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of Indians v. Washoe County'', 112 Nev. 743 (1996); ''Surface Waters of the Yakima River Drainage Basin v. Yakima Reservation Irrigation Dist.'', 121 Wn. 2d 257 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[United States Courts of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''NRDC v. EPA'', 529 F.3d 1077 (D.C. Cir. 2008); ''Second Generation Props., L.P. v. Town of Pelham'', 313 F.3d 620 (1st Cir. 2002); ''Mont. Wilderness Ass'n v. McAllister'', 666 F.3d 549 (9th Cir. 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Articles also appear in treatises written by ''[[American Law Reports]]''&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ann K. Wooster, ''Designation of "Critical Habitat" Under Endangered Species Act'', 176 {{smallcaps|A.L.R. Fed.}} 405.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Westlaw]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Tracy Bateman Farrell, ''Conservation Easements'', 28 {{smallcaps|CA Jur Easements and Licenses in Real Property}} § 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4255">The '''Stefanus Prize''' is a human rights prize awarded to individuals for their outstanding contributions to defending [[Freedom of religion|freedom of religion or belief]] as defined by the Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stefanus.no/no/hva_gjor_vi+/stefanusprisen/ About the Stefanus Prize (Norwegian)&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Stefanus Prize was established in 2005 by the Norwegian NGO [[Stefanus Alliance International]], and has been awarded biennially since 2008. The award ceremony takes place in November in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].

The first recipient of the Stefanus Prize was the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] Bishop Thomas of [[Egypt]]. He received the award on November 11, 2005 for his "fearless and courageous commitment to freedom of belief and human rights in Egypt."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanus.no/no/hva_gjor_vi+/stefanusprisen/2005__biskop_thomas/|title=Stefanusprisen 2005|last=|first=|date=|website=Stefanus Alliance International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selection Committee ==
The laureates are chosen by a committee appointed by the [[Stefanus Alliance International]]. The committee was composed of following members in 2016: [[Knut Vollebæk]] (former Ambassador and Minister of Foreign Affairs), [[Odd Einar Dørum]] (former Minister of Justice), [[Line Henriette Holten Hjemdal]] (member of the [[Storting|Parliament of Norway]]), and Gard Lindseth (board member of the [[Stefanus Alliance International]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanus.no/no/hva_gjor_vi+/stefanusprisen/2016__yildirim_+_erdemir/|title=Stefanusprisen 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=Stefanus Alliance International|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4106">'''Tabnabbing''' is a computer [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] and [[phishing]] attack, which persuades users to submit their [[login]] details and [[password]]s to popular [[website]]s by impersonating those sites and convincing the user that the site is genuine. The attack's name was coined in early 2010 by [[Aza Raskin]], a security researcher and design expert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Claburn |first=Thomas |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/storage/security/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=225200157&amp;subSection=News |title=Tabnapping attack makes phishing easy |publisher=Information Week |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/a-new-type-of-phishing-attack/ |title=Aza Raskin's original tabnabbing disclosure |publisher=Azarask.in |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack takes advantage of user trust and inattention to detail in regard to tabs, and the ability of browsers to navigate across a [[Same-origin policy|page's origin]] in inactive tabs a long time after the page is loaded. Tabnabbing is different from most phishing attacks in that the user no longer remembers that a certain tab was the result of a link unrelated to the login page, because the fake login page is loaded in one of the long-lived open tabs in their browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christina Warren 164 |url=http://mashable.com/2010/05/25/tabnabbing-phishing/ |title=New Type of Phishing Attack Goes After Your Browser Tabs |publisher=Mashable.com |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attack causes the browser to navigate to the impersonated page after the page has been left unattended for some time. A user who returns after a while and sees the login page may be induced to believe the page is legitimate and enter their login, password and other details that will be used for improper purposes. The attack can be made more likely to succeed if the attacker is able to check for well known websites the user has loaded in the past or in other tabs, and loads a simulation of the same sites. This attack can be done even if [[JavaScript]] is disabled, using the "[[meta refresh]]" [[meta element]], an [[HTML attribute]] used for page redirection that causes a reload of a specified new page after a given time interval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adler |first=Eitan |url=http://blog.eitanadler.com/2010/05/tabnabbing-without-javascript.html |title=Eitan Adler's thoughts: Tabnabbing Without Javascript |publisher=Blog.eitanadler.com |date=2010-05-30 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[NoScript]] extension for [[Mozilla]] [[Firefox]] defends both from the JavaScript-based and from the scriptless attack, based on meta refresh, by preventing inactive tabs from changing the location of the page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noscript.net/changelog#1.9.9.81 |title=NoScript 1.9.9.81 changelog announcing specific tabnapping protection |publisher=Noscript.net |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because there are legitimate purposes for inactive tab redirects, it cannot be disabled in all browsers by default without breaking some applications. The attack is also not very common, giving browser vendors little incentive to implement a breaking change.

==Example==
"It can detect that you're logged into [[Citibank]] right now and Citibank has been training you to log into your account every 15 minutes because it logs you out for better security. It's like being hit by the wrong end of the sword.", said [[Aza Raskin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Magid |first=Larry |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-19518_3-20007518-238.html |title=Tabnabbing: Like phishing within browser |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2010-06-11 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3492">'''Tampering with evidence''', or '''evidence tampering''', is an act in which a person alters, conceals, falsifies, or destroys [[evidence (law)|evidence]] with the intent to interfere with an investigation (usually) by a law-enforcement, governmental, or regulatory authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanchirico|first1=Chris W.|title=Evidence Tampering|journal=Duke Law Journal|date=February 2004|volume=53|issue=4|page=1215|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1218&amp;context=dlj|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a [[criminal law|criminal offense]] in many jurisdictions.

Tampering with evidence is closely related to the legal issue of [[spoliation of evidence]], which is usually the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] or [[due process]] version of the same concept (but may itself be a crime).  Tampering with evidence is also closely related to [[obstruction of justice]] and [[perverting the course of justice]], and these two kinds of crimes are often charged together.  The goal of tampering with evidence is usually to [[cover-up|cover up]] a [[crime]].

==By law enforcement==
When police confiscate and destroy a citizen's photographs or recordings of [[police misconduct|officers' misconduct]], the police's act of destroying the evidence may be prosecuted as an act of evidence tampering, if the recordings being destroyed are potential evidence in a criminal or regulatory investigation of the officers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Know Your Rights: Protesters and Photographers|url=https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/photographers-what-do-if-you-are-stopped-or-detained-taking-photographs?redirect=free-speech/know-your-rights-photographers|website=ACLU|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a notable case in [[Nebraska]], officers were charged with the [[felony]] charge of evidence tampering, as well as [[misdemeanor]] [[obstruction of justice|obstruction]] and [[theft]], when they committed [[police brutality|brutality]] and forcibly stole and destroyed the recordings, which was exposed due to a third party's recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanley|first1=Jay|title=Hidden Third Cameraman Proves Crucial in Nebraska Photographer-Abuse Case|url=https://www.aclu.org/blog/hidden-third-cameraman-proves-crucial-nebraska-photographer-abuse-case?redirect=blog/free-speech-criminal-law-reform/hidden-third-cameraman-proves-crucial-nebraska-photographer|website=ACLU|accessdate=21 July 2017|date=8 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, when police departments lose [[exoneration|exonerating]] evidence that would create [[reasonable doubt]] for defendants in the cases they [[prosecute]], such as dashboard-camera footage from patrol cars, it may be regarded as [[spoliation of evidence]], potentially justifying [[motion to dismiss|motions to dismiss]] and/or [[mistrial]]s.  Police's loss of evidence such as footage may be considered as both spoliation and tampering, if it both exonerates the defendant and proves police misconduct.  Spoliation of exonerating evidence in criminal cases may also constitute [[prosecutorial misconduct]] if the [[prosecutor]] is [[complicity|complicit]] in doing so.

[[File:財政部中區國稅局.jpg|thumb|National Taxation Bureau of the Central Area of the [[Ministry of Finance (Republic of China)|Ministry of Finance]]]]

[[Tax]]es provide an important source of revenue for various levels of the [[Government of the Republic of China]]. The tax revenue of Taiwan in 2015 amounted NT$2.1 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=241203&amp;ctNode=2182|title=Taiwan tax revenues top US$62 billion in 2015 - Taiwan Today|first=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China|last=(Taiwan)|date=13 January 2016|website=Taiwan Today|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax administration==
The [[Ministry of Finance (Republic of China)|Ministry of Finance]], which is part of the [[Executive Yuan]], is the highest government entity responsible for implementing taxation policies and overseeing the leveling and collection of taxes. Taxation occurs at both the national and local government level.

===National taxes===
Two broad categories of taxes exist at the national level: customs duties and inland taxes. Customs duties are administered by the Directorate-General of Customs, which has local offices throughout the country. Five national tax administrations who are directly subordinate to the central government handle oversight of all inland taxes. Inland taxes is a broad term that includes:&lt;ref name="types"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ttc.gov.tw/public/Attachment/17259265274.pdf|title=Chapter 1: A General Description of Taxation, Guide to ROC Taxes 2011|author=|date=|website=ttc.gov.tw|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local taxes===
[[File:Brief classification of real estate related tax in Taiwan.jpg|thumb|Brief classification of real estate related tax in Taiwan]]
Individual [[Administrative divisions of the Republic of China|municipalities, counties, and cities]] have set up Revenue Service Offices responsible for collecting a range of taxes, including:&lt;ref name="types" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntat.gov.tw/county/ntat_ch/ntat_en/en1-02.jsp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113030039/http://www.ntat.gov.tw/county/ntat_ch/ntat_en/en1-02.jsp |archivedate=2012-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax legislation==
Unlike the [[Internal Revenue Code]] in the [[United States]], there isn't one law that governs taxation in Taiwan. Rather, taxes are governed by a series of laws and regulations each related to a specific type of tax. As the chief legislative body, the [[Legislative Yuan]] plays an important role in formulating and revising tax related laws. The Income Tax Act is the primary law that governs individual income and profit-seeking enterprise income taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.moj.gov.tw/eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=G0340003 Income Tax Act], Laws &amp; Regulations Database of the Republic of China. Retrieved 24 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual Income Tax==
Both residents and non-residents are assessed individual income tax on Taiwan-sourced income unless an exception is provided in the Income Tax Act and related laws. Individuals are considered residents of Taiwan for tax purposes if they are either domiciled there, or spend for 183 days or longer in a taxable year.

Income received in exchange for services rendered while physically present in Taiwan is considered to be Taiwan-sourced income regardless of if the payer is a local or offshore person or entity. One major exception to this rule exists for non-residents who are physically present in Taiwan for less than 91 calendar days in a year and who are only paid compensation by offshore entities.&lt;ref name="pwctax32"&gt;[http://www.pwc.com/en_TW/tw/publications/assets/taiwan-pocket-tax-book-2011.pdf Introduction to Taiwan tax rules: Taiwan Pocket Tax Book 2011], Page 32. PricewaterhouseCoopers Taiwan. Retrieved 25 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progressive tax===
Taiwan has implemented a [[progressive tax]] system for individual income taxes. For the 2017 tax year, the tax rates were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ttc.gov.tw/public/Attachment/1725927583.pdf|title=Chapter 2: Individual Income Tax, Guide to ROC Taxes 2011|author=|date=|website=ttc.gov.tw|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| 10,310,001 and over || 45%
|}

===Filing of individual income tax===
By default, the tax year for all individuals and profit-seeking enterprises follows the calendar year. Income tax returns are due by May 31 of the following year, with no extension of time allowed.&lt;ref name="pwctax32" /&gt; Taxpayers, including foreigners, are able to complete and file their tax return electronically through software provided by the local taxing authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntat.gov.tw/county/ntat_ch/ntat_en/en9-06.jsp "Taipei National Tax Administration, Ministry of Finance-e-Filing"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205080437/http://www.ntat.gov.tw/county/ntat_ch/ntat_en/en9-06.jsp |date=2011-12-05 }} Retrieved 25 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax==
All profit-seeking businesses in Taiwan are subject to the Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax. [[Sole proprietorship|Sole proprietors]] and [[General partnership|partners]] must file a return. However, their portion of the taxable income is reported on their individual income tax return.&lt;ref name="guidechapter3"&gt;[http://www.ttc.gov.tw/public/Attachment/1725927223.pdf Chapter 3: Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax], Guide to ROC Taxes 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Income tax rate of profit-seeking enterprises===
In 2010, the top tax rate was reduced from 25% to 17%, and the threshold below which no tax is owed was raised from NT$50,000 to NT$120,000. Therefore, the current profit-seeking enterprise tax rates are as follows:&lt;ref name="guidechapter3" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Taxable Income !! Tax Rate
|-
| Below NT$120,000 || 0%
|-
| Above NT$120,000 || 17%
|}

The amount of tax payable shall not exceed half of the amount of the taxable income in excess of NT$120,000.
==Business tax ([[value-added tax]])==
:&lt;code&gt;Tax amount = (sales - purchases) * tax rate &lt;/code&gt;
In 2017, tax rate is 5%.

==Securities transaction tax==
This tax is paid by sellers of Republic of China [[Security (finance)|securities]] at a rate of 0.3% of the gross proceeds from the sale of [[Share (finance)|shares]] issued by companies. A rate of 0.1% applies on the gross proceeds of [[corporate bond]]s, however, an exemption has been put in place through 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntat.gov.tw/county/ntat_ch/ntat_en/en1-03-6.jsp Securities Transactions Tax] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008015336/http://www.ntat.gov.tw/county/ntat_ch/ntat_en/en1-03-6.jsp |date=2011-10-08 }}, Taipei National Tax Administration&lt;/ref&gt; This tax is governed by the regulations set forth in the Securities Transaction Tax Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=G0340078 Laws &amp; Regulations Database and The Republic of China]. Retrieved 26 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real estate speculation and the luxury tax==
Aimed at cooling off [[real estate]] speculation that was driving up the cost of living in [[Taipei City]] and other urban areas, the Republic of China government implemented a new [[luxury tax]] in June 2011. The law imposes a 15% sales tax on owners of second homes who sell within one year of purchase. Additionally, a 10% sales tax is charged against properties sold after being owned for between one and two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aALL&amp;ID=201201150022 "Property market seen likely to recover after poll"], Focus Taiwan News Channel. Published 15 January 2012. Retrieved 26 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Data provided by the Republic of China government in late 2011 showed that the luxury tax was having the desired effect, causing the average housing price in Taipei to fall nearly 12% while reducing overall volume of real estate transactions island-wide by nearly 15% in the June–October time period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2011/12/16/2003520826 "Luxury tax is bringing down prices, ministry says"], Taipei Times.

==Uniform invoice lottery==
{{details|topic=Uniform invoice lottery|Uniform Invoice lottery}}

First conceived in the 1950s, the Taiwan government created a uniform invoice system to encourage honest reporting of sales and prevent underpayment of taxes by businesspeople. To provide an incentive, the government launched a receipt lottery system. Each receipt is coded with an [[alphanumeric]] number, and every two months a lottery drawing is held with prizes ranging up to [[New Taiwan Dollar|NT$]]10 million (approximately $335,000 [[United States Dollar|USD]] as of February 2012) depending on how many numbers match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/02/03/2003524579 "Unlucky bemoan single digit in invoice lottery"] ''Taipei Times''.

'''United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314 (XXIX) (Definition of Aggression)''' was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 14, 1974 as a non-binding recommendation to the [[United Nations Security Council]] on the definition it should use for the [[crime of aggression]].&lt;ref name=Yoram/&gt;

== Background ==
The adoption of the definition was the culmination of a long process begun in 1923 under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]]. In December 1967 the General Assembly adopted Resolution 2330 (XXII), which established a Special Committee on the Question of Defining Aggression. This body comprised 35 member states.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES2330XXII_page2"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-2330(XXII) |type=Resolution| body=General Assembly |page=2 |accessdate=2007-11-13|date=18 December 1967|title=Need to expedite the drafting of a definition of aggression in light of the present international situation}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seven years, it reported back to the General Assembly with draft proposals that formed the basis of the final Definition of Aggression.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES3314XXIX_page1"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-3314(XXIX) |type=Resolution| body=General Assembly ||page=1 |accessdate=2007-11-13| title=Definition of aggression}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The definition of aggression ==
The definition makes a distinction between ''[[aggression]]'' (which "gives rise to international responsibility") and ''[[war of aggression]]'' (which is "a crime against international peace"). Article 3 "in accordance with the provisions of article 2", defines certain acts as aggression, such as armed invasions or attacks, bombardments, blockades, armed violations of territory, permitting other states to use one's own territory to perpetrate acts of aggression and the employment of armed irregulars or mercenaries to carry out acts of aggression. Article 2 states that the first use of force in contravention of the UN Charter will be prima facie evidence of aggression, but the Security Council has the authority to determine that given the circumstances aggression has not taken place. A war of aggression is a series of acts committed with a sustained intent. The definition's distinction between an ''act'' of aggression and a ''war'' of aggression make it clear that not every act of aggression would constitute a crime against peace; only war of aggression does. States would nonetheless be held responsible for acts of aggression.

== Criticisms of the definition ==
The wording of the definition has been criticised by many commentators. Its clauses on the use of armed irregulars are vague, as it is unclear what level of "involvement" would entail state responsibility. It is also highly state-centric, in that it deems states to be the only actors liable for acts of aggression. Domestic or transnational insurgent groups, such as those that took part in the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] and the [[Yugoslav Wars]], were key players in their respective conflicts despite being non-state parties; they would not have come within the scope of the definition.

The Definition of Aggression also does not cover acts by international organisations. The two key military alliances at the time of the definition's adoption, [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], were non-state parties and thus were outside the scope of the definition.&lt;ref&gt;Ingrid Detter Delupis, ''The Law of War'', pp. 69-70. Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the definition does not deal with the responsibilities of individuals for acts of aggression. It is widely perceived as an insufficient basis on which to ground individual criminal prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;L.F. Damrosch, "Enforcing International Law through Non-forcible Measures", p. 202. ''Recueil De Cours/Collected Courses'', Académie de Droit International de La Haye, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition is not binding on the Security Council. The [[United Nations Charter]] empowers the General Assembly to make recommendations to the [[United Nations Security Council]] but the Assembly may not dictate to the Council. The resolution accompanying the definition states that it is intended to provide guidance to the Security Council to aid it "in determining, in accordance with the Charter, the existence of an act of aggression".&lt;ref name=Yoram&gt;[[Yoram Dinstein]], ''War, Aggression and Self-Defence'', p. 118. Cambridge University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council may apply or disregard this guidance as it sees fit. Legal commentators argued in 1999 that the Definition of Aggression has had "no visible impact" on the deliberations of the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Bassiouni and B.B. Ferencz, "The Crime against Peace", ''International Criminal Law'', I, 313, 334 (M.C. Bassiouni ed., 2nd ed., 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Court for China''' was a [[United States district court]] that had [[Extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] jurisdiction over [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizens]] in [[China]]. It existed from 1906 to 1943 and had jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters, with appeals taken to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] in [[San Francisco]].

==Consular Courts prior to establishment of court==

[[Extraterritoriality|Extraterritorial]] jurisdiction in China was first granted to the United States by the [[Treaty of Wanghia]] upon ratification in 1845,&lt;ref&gt;implemented in ''An Act to Carry Into Effect Certain Provisions in the Treaties Between the United States and China and the Ottoman Porte, Giving Certain Judicial Powers to Ministers and Consuls of the United States in Those Countries'', {{USStatute|30|150|9|276|1848|8|11}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[Treaty of Tientsin]] ratified in 1860.

Under the treaties, cases against US citizens were tried in US [[consular court]]s, while cases against Chinese nationals were tried in Chinese courts.{{sfn|Ruskola|2008|p=220}} Consuls had jurisdiction in the following matters:

:* criminal cases where the punishment for the offense charged did not exceed a $100 fine or 60 days imprisonment, from which there was no appeal;&lt;ref&gt;1848 Act, s. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
:* criminal cases where the punishment for the offense charged did not exceed a $500 fine or 90 days imprisonment, from which an appeal was available to the commissioner of the United States in China;&lt;ref&gt;1848 Act, s. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and
:* civil cases, in which those for damages not exceeding $500 were generally not subject to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;1848 Act, s. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The commissioner had jurisdiction to hear all cases, and could prescribe rules of civil and criminal procedure for the consuls to follow.&lt;ref&gt;1848 Act, s. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment of Court==
[[File:American Consulate General and US Court for China, Shanghai 1907.png|thumb|[[Consulate General of the United States, Shanghai|American Consulate General]] and US Court for China, Shanghai 1907]]
The Court was established in 1906 by the Act Creating a United States Court for China.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act Creating a United States Court for China and prescribing the jurisdiction thereof'', {{USStatute|59|403|34|814|1906|6|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Court was similar in structure to the [[British Supreme Court for China and Corea]] that had been established in Shanghai in 1865. 

The court was originally headquartered in [[Consulate General of the United States, Shanghai|American Consulate General]] building on Huangpu Road in the [[Shanghai International Settlement]], with additional sessions held at least annually in the Chinese cities of [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[Tianjin|Tientsin]], and [[Hankou|Hankow]]. The court moved with the [[Consulate General of the United States, Shanghai|US Consulate]] when the consulate was moved from its previous premises in the years 1911, 1930 and 1936.

The Court had only one full time judge, and those on trial sometimes had to wait months for proceedings. In the 1930s, the law was amended to allow the appointment of special judges, allowing trials to proceed in the judge's absence.  Appeals were allowed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;1906 Act, s. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ninth Circuit 1905.jpg|thumb|left|The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco which heard appeals from the US Court for China]]

The U.S. [[consular court]]s in China retained limited jurisdiction, including civil cases where property involved in the controversy did not exceed $500 and criminal cases where the punishment did not exceed $100 in fines or 60 days' imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;1906 Act, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Court exercised appellate jurisdiction over them, as well as, until 1910 when Japan annexed Korea, US Consular Courts in Korea.

==Jurisprudence==
The court's jurisdiction was given an expansive interpretation:

:* while the Treaty strictly covered only US citizens, the Court assumed jurisdiction over [[United States nationality law#Nationals who are not citizens|US non-citizen national]]s who originated from "possessions" (i.e. colonies) such as the [[Insular Government|Philippines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= United States v. Scogin|vol= I|reporter= Extraterritorial Cases|opinion= 376|pinpoint= |court= USC-C|date= 1914|url= https://archive.org/stream/extraterritorial01unit#page/376/mode/2up|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= United States v.

:* even where the [[State Department]] discriminated against [[Chinese-American]]s living abroad in China, the Court held that "an American citizen in China, whether residing temporarily or permanently, remains as much under the jurisdiction of his government, its laws and its institutions as if he were residing at home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= In re Robert Lee's Will|vol= I|reporter= Extraterritorial Cases|opinion= 699|pinpoint= 710|court= USC-C|date= 1918|url= https://archive.org/stream/extraterritorial01unit#page/698/mode/2up|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* it enforced consular title deeds where US citizens held land in trust for Chinese beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Latter|first= A.M.|date= 1903|title= The Government of the Foreigners in China|url= |journal= [[Law Quarterly Review]]|publisher= |volume= 19|issue= |pages= 316}}, at 322&lt;/ref&gt;
:* in divorce and annulment cases, only the plaintiff had to be an American resident in China: there were no residency or nationality requirements for defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Richards v. Richards|vol= I|reporter= Extraterritorial Cases|opinion= 480|pinpoint= |court= USC-C|date= 1915|url= https://archive.org/stream/extraterritorial01unit#page/480/mode/2up|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:6Consulate ca 1916 from river.jpg|thumb|The [[Consulate General of the United States, Shanghai|United States Consulate]] on the banks of the Huangpu River. The court was in the building on the left from 1911 to 1930]]
The sources of law drawn upon by the Court were quite varied:

:* Because the court was based outside of the United States, the [[United States Constitution]] did not apply; there was no right to a jury trial nor to constitutional [[due process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Casement v. Squier|vol= 138|reporter= F.2d|opinion= 909|pinpoint= |court= 9th Cir.|date= 1943|url= https://casetext.com/case/casement-v-squier-2|accessdate= |quote=}}, citing ''[[In re Ross]]'', {{ussc|140|453|1891}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* It was also provided that where "the laws of the United States ... are deficient in the provisions necessary to give jurisdiction or to furnish suitable remedies, the common law and the law as established by the decisions of the courts of the United States shall be applied."&lt;ref&gt;1906 Act, s.4&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The municipal regulations of the [[Shanghai International Settlement]] were also recognized and given effect.{{sfn|Ruskola|2008|p=233}}
:* [[Traditional Chinese law]] was applied by the Court in some cases, as well as local "[[compradore]]" or "Chinese custom."{{sfn|Ruskola|2008|p=233}}

The question as to what constituted "common law" led to severe difficulties, because U.S. federal law did not cover many criminal offenses or civil matters (which were normally provided for by U.S. state law). The [[Ninth Circuit]] provided a solution to this conundrum in the case of ''Biddle v. United States'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Biddle v. United States|vol= 156|reporter= F.|opinion= 759|pinpoint= |court= 9th Cir.|date= 1907|url= https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F/0156.f1.hein.pdf|accessdate= |quote=}}, reversing (on other grounds) {{cite court |litigants= United States v. C.A. Biddle|vol= I|reporter= Extraterritorial Cases|opinion= 84|pinpoint= 87|court= USC-C|date= 1907|url= https://archive.org/stream/extraterritorial01unit#page/84/mode/2up|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was held that the laws of the [[Territory of Alaska]] or the [[District of Columbia]] were federal law and could be applied by the Court.{{efn|Judge [[Charles S. Lobingier]] gave detailed evidence on the workings of, and application of law by, the court and extraterritoriality in China to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Hearings before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives, 65th Congress Sept 27 and 28 and 1 October 1917&lt;/ref&gt;}} As a result, Judge Lobingier would later hold that "there can be no half way adoption of that doctrine; it includes all such laws or none. It cannot logically be restricted to any particular class of acts. It is just as applicable to civil laws as to criminal; just as 'necessary' in respect to corporations as to procedure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= United States ex rel. Raven v. McRae|vol= I|reporter= Extraterritorial Cases|opinion= 655|pinpoint= 664|court= USC-C|date= 1917|url= https://archive.org/stream/extraterritorial01unit#page/654/mode/2up|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ka Lee Hotel, circa 1914.png|thumb|left|The former Kalee Hotel, the court was located on the 2nd floor from 1930 to 1936]]
The Court prescribed its own rules for procedures to be followed.&lt;ref&gt;1906 Act, s. 5&lt;/ref&gt; This was in contrast to the situation in the States, where [[Civil procedure in the United States|civil procedure]] in actions at law (i.e., most lawsuits for monetary damages) in U.S. federal courts was normally provided for by state law, by virtue of the Conformity Act of 1872,&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to further the Administration of Justice'', {{USStatute|42|255|17|196|1872|6|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the promulgation of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in 1938.

The [[United States Congress]] also passed several statutes conferring specific powers on the Court:

:* '' An Act to Regulate the Practice of Pharmacy and the Sale of Poison in the Consular Districts of the United States in China'', {{USStatute|63|262|38|817|1915|3|3}}
:* ''China Trade Act, 1922'', {{USStatute|67|312|42|849|1922|9|19}}, as amended by {{USStatute|68|484|43|995|1925|2|26}}

==Court Seal==
[[File:Certificate of Clerk of US Court for China under seal.png|thumb|100px|Certificate of Clerk of US Court for China bearing the seal of the court]]
The act establishing the court provided:  "The seal of the United States Court for China shall be the arms of the United States, engraved on a circular piece of steel of the size of a half dollar, with these words in the margin 'The Seal of the United States Court for China'".  The seal was to be used to seal all writs, processes and other documents issued by the court.

==Imprisonment==
[[File:McNeil Island Penitentiary - NARA - 299566.tif|thumb|left|McNeil Island Penitentiary in 1937]]
Persons who were convicted of criminal offences for relatively short sentences for either imprisoned in the Consular Gaol in the consulate or [[Tilanqiao Prison|Ward Road Gaol]] (and sometimes Amoy Road Gaol) run by the [[Shanghai Municipal Council]].  Those serving longer sentences were sent to [[New Bilibid Prison|Bilibid Prison]] in the [[Philippines]] and later from the 1920s were generally sent to the [[McNeil Island Corrections Center|federal penitentiary]] at [[McNeil Island]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] State to serve their sentence.{{sfn|Allman|1943|p=99}}

==Abolition==
[[File:Development Building (2).JPG|thumb|right|The Development Building on Fuzhou Road.  The court was located on the 6th floor of this building from 1936 to 1941.]] The United States Consulate and Court in Shanghai were occupied by the Japanese on 8 December 1941 at the beginning of the [[Pacific War]].  The Judge and other staff were interned for 6 months before being repatriated.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, "US Officials kept in Hotel, December 9, 1941 and "Gripsholm brings 1,500 from the Orient" August 26, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;  

Americans continued to enjoy extraterritorial rights in those parts of China not occupied by the Japanese. On 11 January 1943, the U.S. and China signed the [[Sino-American New Equal Treaty|Treaty for Relinquishment of Extraterritorial Rights in China]], thereby relinquishing all U.S. extraterritorial rights.   The treaty was ratified by the [[United States Senate]] and came into force on 20 May 1943. As a result, both the U.S. Court for China and the U.S. Consular Courts in China were abolished. However, their judgments continued to serve as [[res judicata]] within China.

The very last case before the court was heard in [[Kunming]] starting on 14 January 1943. Boatner Carney of the [[Flying Tigers]] was prosecuted for manslaughter before Special Judge Bertrand E Johnson.  Carney was convicted of unlawful killing and sentenced to two years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sun Herald|The Daily Herald]]'' (Biloxi and Gulfport), Jan 18, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; He was pardoned 6 months later by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].
