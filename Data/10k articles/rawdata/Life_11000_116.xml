'''0010x0010''' is a Dutch-born [[audiovisual art]]ist, currently living in Los Angeles.

==Early years==
In his early years, being inspired by underground techno, he released a series of [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]] under various pseudonyms (only one using his real name) and he performed live [[acid techno]] sets at underground parties such as Acid Rain at Amsterdam Graansilo. During the recording sessions for one of the tracks he produced for ex [[Soul II Soul]] and [[The Shamen]] singer Victoria Wilson James's album on Sony Music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Victoria-Wilson-James-Colorfields/release/591843|title=Victoria Wilson-James - Colorfields|website=Discogs|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was suggested that he audition for the "De Bende van Venlo", a theatre piece based on a true crime story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theaterencyclopedie.nl/wiki/De_bende_van_Venlo_-_Stichting_Theaterwerkplaats_Limburg_Het_Kruis_van_Bourgondi%C3%AB_-_1997-07-04|title=De bende van Venlo - Stichting Theaterwerkplaats Limburg Het Kruis van Bourgondië - 1997-07-04 - TheaterEncyclopedie|website=theaterencyclopedie.nl|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cast in one of the lead roles and performed over thirty European shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1997/07/05/vooral-sfeer-en-spektakel-in-stuk-de-bende-van-venlo-7359654-a1211521|title=Vooral sfeer en spektakel in stuk De Bende van Venlo|website=nrc.nl|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/toneelstuk-over-bende-van-venlo-begint-met-rap-gewetenloze-killers-een-gruwelijke-afslachting~a484780/|title=Toneelstuk over Bende van Venlo begint met rap 'Gewetenloze killers, een gruwelijke afslachting' – Binnenland – de Volkskrant|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/theater/de-bende-van-venlo-zit-vol-met-gemiste-kansen~a494401/|title=De Bende van Venlo zit vol met gemiste kansen – Theater – de Volkskrant|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Los Angeles==
After the theatre experience, Universal / [[Island Records]] won the label-bidding and signed him as an artist and producer.He released one single and one video before he left the label due to creative differences and moved from London to Los Angeles to work on his art, film, photography and editing &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2011/01/in-the-works-new-doc-from-paris-is-burning-director-sundances-pariah-chicago-mob-boss-more-243995/|title=In the Works: New Doc from "Paris is Burning" Director, Sundance’s "Pariah," Chicago Mob Boss &amp; More - IndieWire|first=Bryce J.|last=Renninger|website=www.indiewire.com|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; career. He took a break from that to release the track ''LA Mellow'' (as D'ray), a collaboration with Dutch Dj, producer [[Gregor Salto]]. ''Ultimate Miami 2'', the album with ''LA Mellow'' and music by artists like [[Wiwek]], [[Zki &amp; Dobre|Chocolate Puma]] and [[Sidney Samson]] reached No. 6 at Beatport's House top 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bptoptracker.com/artist/dray/298277/releases|title=D'RAY – Beatport Top Tracker|first=Julien|last=Mahin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2015, he finished working as the visual supervisor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiancemagazine.com/2010/07/31/interview-with-dutch-filmmaker-mziah|title=Interview with Dutch filmmaker mZiah – Asiance Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a documentary about Russian director [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] based on his diaries [[Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970–1986|Time within Time]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2311128/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|title=Tarkovsky: Time Within Time|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/tarkovsky-does-berlin-0817|title=Among the Tarkovsky Fanatics at an Underground Retrospective in Berlin – VICE – United States|date=18 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Tonino Guerra]]. In 2016, he released two EPs (as 0010x0010 and T3TSUO 303) on his Generation Acid label which both landed in the [[Beatport]] Techno Top 100 charts. The May 2017 released [[acid techno]] album |||Ø||| &lt;ref&gt;https://www.discogs.com/0010X0010-%C3%98/release/10234031&lt;/ref&gt; made it to the techno and house top 10 charts on both [[Beatport]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bptoptracker.com/label/generation-acid/28924/releases|title=Generation Acid – Beatport Top Tracker|first=Julien|last=Mahin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Juno Records]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2764">'''Alogobotur''' ({{lang-bg|Aлогоботур}}) (died 926) was a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] noble and military commander during the reign of [[Tsar]] [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon the Great]] (893&amp;ndash;926). He was probably a ''komit'' (duke) of one of [[Bulgaria]]'s provinces. Some scholars indicate that the name is not a personal name, but a Bulgar military title ''alp [[Baghatur|bagatur]]'' (great hero) or ''alo bagatur'' (commander of heroes).&lt;ref name="Rogers2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Clifford|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Medieval Warfare and Military Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzwpq6bLHhMC&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=29 April 2012|date=21 June 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533403-6|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Constantine Porphyrogennetos]] argues that for some time Alogobotur led all of the Bulgarian armies.&lt;ref name="Rogers2010"/&gt; In 926, Alogobotur was in command of a campaign against the [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Serbs]] who were plotting with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] against the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Иречек, К. История на българите, 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="naukite)fakultet1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Institut za istorii͡a͡ (Bŭlgarska akademii͡a͡ na naukite)|author2=Sofiĭski universitet.

The Serbs were easily defeated and fled to Croatia but the campaign in the later ended with a disaster: the Bulgarian army was completely defeated in the [[battle of the Bosnian Highlands]] by the [[Croats]] under their King [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] in 926.&lt;ref name="Ireland(Organization)1882"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|author2=JSTOR (Organization)|title=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tnxrpm8qbxUC|accessdate=29 April 2012|year=1882}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alogobotur most probably perished in the battle along with most of his soldiers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1914">'''Alonso (or Alfonso) de Burgos''' (before 1477 – 1499) was the royal confessor of [[Ferdinand and Isabella]].

He was born of a noble family in [[Burgos]] and died at [[Palencia]] in 1499.

He was conspicuous for learning before his entrance into the [[Dominican order]], early in life. His preaching attracted the notice of Ferdinand and Isabella, who selected him as royal confessor. On the recommendation of the latter, Alfonso was appointed to the see of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Córdoba|Córdoba]] by [[Sixtus IV]], 30 April 1477. Remaining there only four years, he was transferred to the [[Bishopric of Cuenca]], and in 1484, or according to [[P. B. Gams]] (''Series Episcoporum'', P. 64) in 1486, to [[Palencia]].

At the same time he held successively the office of Grand Chaplain of the Court, Counsellor of the Catholic King, and President of the [[Council of Castile]].
 
In the latter capacity he was instrumental in getting pecuniary grants from the crown for Columbus. During the years 1487 and 1488 he obtained eight thousand pounds at various times for the fitting out of a fleet. In the absence of the king he exercised his right as President of the Council in giving orders for a payment of three thousand pounds to the discoverer.

These duties did not hinder him from repairing many dilapidated churches of his diocese. He built, out of his own revenues, the Dominican convent of St. Vincent Ferrer at Palencia, in 1486. He takes a high rank in the history of Spanish education for completing the [[Colegio de San Gregorio]] at [[Valladolid]], begun by King [[Alfonso the Wise]] (1252–1284). Posterity justly calls him the founder of this famous college of his order.

{{refimprove|date=April 2018}}

In 2018, China's [[artificial intelligence]] industry lags behind that of the [[United States]], both in terms of technological and theoretical development. However, in 2017 China issued a [[Artificial_intelligence_industry_in_China#New_Generation_of_Artificial_Intelligence_Development_Plan|plan]] to become the global leader in artificial intelligence by 2030. 

==Current industry and academia==
[[China]] is home to several major AI-centric companies, including [[Baidu]], [[Tencent]], and [[Alibaba]]. China is also home to countless startups related to the development of AI. SenseTime, founded in 2014 by researchers at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], produces computer vision technology for large Chinese companies such as [[China Mobile]] and [[JD.com]]. Peking University introduced the first academic course on AI in 2004, leading many other Chinese universities to adopt AI as a discipline.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cyranoski|first1=David|title=China enters the battle for AI talent|journal=Nature|date=January 17, 2018|volume=553|issue=7688|page=260-261|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-00604-6|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-00604-6|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with the West==
The gap between China's AI industry and that of the [[United States]] is closing fast in terms of private investment, patents, and publications &lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;. Many AI experts have speculated that China will struggle to recruit experts in the field &lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;. However, China also boasts of some advantages which could prove to be critical. China has a strong precedent of government investment leading to industrial development. Further, fewer regulations hinder data collection and usage in China, which has proven to be advantageous in the realm of facial recognition &lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knight|first1=Will|title=China's AI Awakening|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/609038/chinas-ai-awakening/|accessdate=April 3, 2018|agency=MIT|publisher=Technology Review|date=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In summary, China benefits from stronger government dedication to the industry and fewer obstacles related to privacy and data integrity.

In April 2018, [[CNN]] noted that the two AI startups with the highest evaluation, SenseTime (4.5 billion USD) and Yitu Technology (2.4 billion USD), are both Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pham|first1=Sherisse|title=Chinese AI startup dwarfs global rivals with $4.5 billion valuation|url=http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/09/technology/china-ai-sensetime-startup/index.html|accessdate=10 April 2018|work=CNNMoney|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Complete List of Unicorn Companies|url=https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies|website=CB Insights|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New generation of artificial intelligence development plan==
China's State Council issued the "A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan" (State Council Document [2017] No. 35) on July 8, 2017, in which the [[Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China|CCP Central Committee]] and the State Council urge the governing bodies of China to promote the development of artificial intelligence. The State Council predicts that China will become a world-leader in artificial intelligence by 2030. Specifically, the State Council plans to spend $2.1 billion on an AI industrial park in [[Mentougou_District|Mentougou district]] &lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;. In order to achieve this end, the State Council states the need for massive talent acquisition, theoretical and practical developments, and public and private investments. In the document, the State Council lists myriad sectors open to the future influence of artificial intelligence, including transportation, healthcare, environmental protection, national security, social governance, and education. Throughout the document, the State Council emphasizes the need for focus on the ethics of artificial intelligence. &lt;ref name="State"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Council Notice on the Issuance of the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan|url=https://na-production.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/translation-fulltext-8.1.17.pdf|publisher=New America|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

The State Council cites many motivating factors in their desire to become a global leader in artificial intelligence. Primarily, the [[State_Council_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China|State Council]] focuses on the potential for industrial growth and transformation. The State Council recognizes that "AI has become the core driving force for a new round of industrial transformation."&lt;ref name="State" /&gt; Many of their motivating factors resemble those of the West -- industry and national security, as well as "education, medical care, pensions, environmental protection, urban operations, judicial services, and other fields."&lt;ref name="State" /&gt; However, the State Council also alludes to motivating factors that do not resemble those of the West. The State Council details the potential of artificial intelligence to "grasp group cognition and psychological changes in a timely manner... elevate the capability and level of social governance... maintain social stability." &lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

==Relative advantages and disadvantages==
The State Council acknowledges several relative advantages and disadvantages with regard to AI innovation potential, when compared to the West.

===Advantages===
The State Council cites preceding development plans, such as the National Key Research and Development Plan, Internet +, and AI Three-Year Activities and Implementation Program as evidence of forthcoming success. The State Council draws attention to the fact that China is "leading the world in voice recognition and visual recognition technologies."&lt;ref name="State" /&gt; Further, they note that China is second in the world in international publications and patents in the domain of artificial intelligence. Instructing their audience to "fully give play to the advantages of the socialist system," the State Council claims that the greater levels of central coordination will allow them to more efficiently make advancements in such a complex industry.&lt;ref name="State" /&gt; Developments in AI will require a collaboration between the regulatory bodies, private enterprises, educational institutions, and military researchers, so they make a valid point with their claim. 

===Disadvantages===
The State Council acknowledges that China is not quite at the level of developed countries (particularly the United States) with regard to AI development. They admit that China is "lacking major original results in basic theory, core algorithms, key equipment, high-end chips, major products and systems. foundational materials, components, software and interfaces, etc." &lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

==Timeline==
The State Council reports three general milestones for their integration of artificial intelligence into their industrial economy.

===2020===
By 2020, China expects to be "in step with globally advanced levels" of artificial intelligence theoretical and technological development. The State Council foresees that by this time "AI technology applications will have become a new way to improve people's livelihoods." The State Council predicts that China will have contributed globally to hardware, software, and methods pertinent to artificial intelligence. Specifically, the State Council projects the value of AI core industry in China to be worth 150 billion RMB, with a value of over 1 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.&lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

===2025===
By 2025, the State Council aims for China to have fundamentally contributed to basic AI theory, solidifying its place as a global leader in AI research. Further, the State Council aims that "AI becomes the main driving force for China's industrial upgrading and economic transformation" by this time. The State Council projects the value of AI core industry in China to be worth 400 billion RMB, with a value of over 5 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.&lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

===2030===
By this time, the State Council targets China to be the global leader in the development of artificial intelligence theory and technology. The State Council claims that China will have developed a "mature new-generation AI theory and technology system." At this point, the State Council projects the value of AI core industry to be worth 1 trillion RMB, with a value of over 10 trillion RMB when accounting for related industries.&lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

==Talent acquisition==
The State Council recognizes that talent acquisition is arguably the most crucial endeavor in bolstering its AI industry. The State Council wishes to produce individuals capable of reasoning about the whole spectrum of AI development, including components such as basic theory, application, and product development. The State Council states a desire to solidify AI as a discipline, and formalize its treatment in universities. Further, they plan on constructing "national AI industrial parks." They even go so far as to suggest AI-related courses in primary and secondary schools. Extending upon educational infrastructure, the State Council aims to provide "AI 'hackerspaces'" and "entrepreneurial service agencies" dedicated to AI.&lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

==Ethical considerations==
The State Council emphasized the importance of ethics in AI development. In each of their three milestones (2020, 2025, and 2030), the State Council includes a specific goal related to the development of research into or enforcement of AI-related ethics. Despite the fear of many Westerners that the Chinese will disregard privacy concerns and other data-related rights infringements, the State Council states its wishes to "increase disciplinary efforts aimed at the abuse of data, violations of personal privacy, and actions contrary to moral ethics." In the short term, the State Council aims to look into AI's effects on employment, while it aims to look into AI's effects on social ethics in the long term.&lt;ref name="State" /&gt;

{{Martin Luther King Jr. sidebar}}
[[Martin Luther King Jr.]], an American [[clergyman]] and civil rights leader, was shot at the [[Lorraine Motel]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], on April 4, 1968. King was rushed to [[St. Joseph's Hospital (Memphis, Tennessee)|St. Joseph's Hospital]], and was pronounced dead at 7:05&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|CST]]. He was a prominent [[Leadership|leader]] of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate who was known for his use of [[nonviolence]] and [[civil disobedience]].

[[James Earl Ray]], a fugitive from the [[Missouri State Penitentiary]], was arrested on June 8, 1968, in [[London]] at [[Heathrow Airport]], extradited to the United States, and charged with the crime. On March 10, 1969, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 99 years in the [[Tennessee State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Pepper|2003|page=8}} He later made many attempts to withdraw his guilty plea and be tried by a jury, but was unsuccessful; he died in prison on April 23, 1998, at age 70.{{sfn|Pepper|2003|page=97}}

==Background==

===King on death===
As early as the mid-1950s, King had received death threats due to his prominence in the Civil Rights Movement. He had confronted the risk of death, including a [[Izola Curry#Assassination attempt on Martin Luther King Jr.|nearly fatal stabbing]] in 1958, and made its recognition part of his philosophy. He taught that murder could not stop the struggle for equal rights. After the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President Kennedy]] in 1963, King told his wife [[Coretta Scott King|Coretta]], "This is what is going to happen to me also. I keep telling you, this is a sick society."&lt;ref name=MED08&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/April-1968-Martin-Changed-America/dp/0465002129|last=Dyson|first=Michael Eric|title=April 4, 1968: Martin Luther King Jr.'s death and how it changed America|year=2008|publisher=[[Haymarket Books#Imprints|Basic Civitas Books]]|edition=1st|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=978-0465002122|chapter=Fighting Death}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WAA69&gt;(via Google News) {{cite news|title=King had predicted he too would be killed|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZrYlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8_QFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3439%2C4781621|accessdate=July 20, 2012|work=[[The Washington Afro American]]|publisher=[[Baltimore Afro-American]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|date=September 9, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memphis===
{{Main|Memphis sanitation strike}}
King traveled to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], in support of striking African American city sanitation workers. The [[Memphis sanitation strike|workers had staged]] a walkout on February 11, 1968, to protest unequal wages and working conditions imposed by then-mayor [[Henry Loeb]]. At the time, Memphis paid black workers significantly lower wages than whites. There were no city-issued uniforms, no restrooms, no recognized union, and no grievance procedure for the numerous occasions on which they were underpaid. During Loeb's tenure as Mayor, conditions did not significantly improve, and the gruesome February 1968 deaths of two workers in a garbage-compacting truck turned mounting tensions into a strike.&lt;ref name="Southern Hollows podcast"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Accident on a Garbage Truck That Led to the Death of Martin Luther King, Jr.|publisher=Southern Hollows podcast|url=http://www.southernhollows.com/episodes/memphissanitationstrike|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King participated in a massive march in Memphis on March 28, 1968, that ended in violence.&lt;ref name="Southern Hollows podcast"/&gt; On April 3, King returned to Memphis to attempt a successful new march later that week. His airline flight to Memphis was delayed by a bomb threat but he arrived in time to make a planned speech to a gathering at the [[Mason Temple]] (World Headquarters of the [[Church of God in Christ]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/04/04/time-looks-back-martin-luther-kings-assassination/|title=TIME Looks Back: The Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|author=Time Magazine Staff|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|location=United States|date=April 4, 2013|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/tony-norman/2008/04/04/The-last-sermon-Memphis-April-3-1968/stories/200804040201|title=The last sermon, Memphis, April 3, 1968|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|publisher=[[Block Communications]]|location=[[Pittsburgh]]|date=April 4, 2008|first=Tony|last=Norman|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="About.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Jennifer|title=Martin Luther King Jr. Assassinated|url=http://history1900s.about.com/cs/martinlutherking/a/mlkassass.htm|work=20th Century History|publisher=About.com|accessdate=July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There, King delivered the speech, now known as the "[[I've Been to the Mountaintop]]" address. In it, he recalled his 1958 attempted assassination, noting that the doctor who treated him said that because the knife used to stab him was so near to his aorta, any sudden movement, even a sneeze, might have killed him.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;Alexandra S. Levine, ”New York Today: If Martin Luther King Had Sneezed” , ''New York Times'', January 12, 2017. Accessed August 11, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; He referred to a letter, written by a young girl, who told him she was happy he had not sneezed. He used that reference to say,

{{quote|I, too, am happy that I didn’t sneeze. Because if I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have been around here in 1960, when students all over the South started sitting-in at lunch counters. If I had sneezed, I wouldn’t have been around here in 1961, when we decided to take a ride for freedom and ended segregation in interstate travel.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;}}

He repeated the phrase, "If I had sneezed", several more times, recalling numerous other events and acts of civil disobedience of the previous several years: the [[Albany Movement]] (1962), the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in 1963, and the [[Selma to Montgomery March]] (1965).&lt;ref&gt;The King Encyclopedia, “[https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/ive-been-mountaintop I've Been to the Mountaintop]", The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute (Stanford). Accessed August 11, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

As he neared the close, he referred to the bomb threat:

{{quote|And then I got to Memphis. And some began to say the threats... or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers? Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn't matter with me now. Because I've been to the mountaintop. And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've ''seen'' the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land! And so I'm happy, tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. My eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/publications/speeches/I've_been_to_the_mountaintop.pdf "I've Been to the Mountaintop"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216012709/http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/publications/speeches/I%27ve_been_to_the_mountaintop.pdf |date=February 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Assassination==

On Thursday, April 4, 1968, King was staying in room 306 at the [[National Civil Rights Museum|Lorraine Motel]] in Memphis. The motel was owned by businessman Walter Bailey and named after his wife. Reverend [[Ralph Abernathy]], a colleague and friend, later told the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] he and King had stayed in room 306 at the Lorraine Motel so often that it was known as the "King–Abernathy Suite".&lt;ref name="usdoj"&gt;{{cite web |title=United States Department of Justice Investigation of Recent Allegations Regarding the Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr - VII.

According to biographer [[Taylor Branch]], King's last words were to musician [[Ben Branch]], who was scheduled to perform that night at a planned event. King said, "Ben, make sure you play '[[Take My Hand, Precious Lord]]' in the meeting tonight. Play it real pretty."{{sfn|Branch|2007|page=766}}

King had gone out onto the balcony and was standing near his room when he was struck at 6:01&amp;nbsp;p.m. by a single [[.30-06 Springfield|.30-06 bullet]] fired from a [[Remington Model 760]] rifle.&lt;ref name="tcl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/assassins/ray/7.html|title=James Earl Ray: The Man Who Killed Dr. Martin Luther King|first=Mark|last=Gribben|publisher=truetv.com|accessdate=February 5, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131212711/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/terrorists_spies/assassins/ray/7.html|archive-date=January 31, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bullet entered through King's right cheek, breaking his jaw and several [[vertebra]]e as it traveled down his spinal cord, severing his [[jugular vein]] and major arteries in the process, before lodging in his shoulder. The force of the shot ripped King's necktie off. King fell violently backward onto the balcony, unconscious. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Shortly after the shot was fired, witnesses saw a man, later believed to be [[James Earl Ray]], fleeing from a rooming house across the street from the Lorraine Motel. Ray had been renting a room there. Police found a package dumped close to the site, which included a rifle and binoculars, both with Ray's fingerprints. Ray had purchased the rifle under an alias six days earlier. A worldwide manhunt was triggered, which culminated in the arrest of Ray at [[London]]'s [[Heathrow Airport]] two months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/mlk1.html|title=Martin Luther King, Jr.: Assassination Conspiracy Theories|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Abernathy heard the shot from inside the motel room and ran to the balcony to find King on the deck, bleeding profusely from the wound in his cheek.&lt;ref name="tcl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CHI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. |publisher=Christian History Institute|date=March 2007|url=http://chi.gospelcom.net/lives_events/more/mlk.shtml|accessdate=July 21, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070811134531/http://chi.gospelcom.net/lives_events/more/mlk.shtml |archivedate=August 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesse Jackson stated after the shooting that he cradled King's head as King lay on the balcony, but this account was disputed by other colleagues of King; Jackson later changed his statement to say that he had "reached out" for King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Koch Says Jackson Lied About Actions After Dr. King Was Slain |date=April 18, 1988 |last=Purnick |first=Joyce |accessdate=June 11, 2008 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/18/us/koch-says-jackson-lied-about-actions-after-dr-king-was-slain.html |archivedate=January 4, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DQKbK1JD?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/18/us/koch-says-jackson-lied-about-actions-after-dr-king-was-slain.html |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Young]], a colleague from the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], first believed King was dead, but found he still had a pulse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Andrew Young|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/jesse/interviews/young.html|accessdate=February 4, 2013|newspaper=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King was rushed to [[St. Joseph's Hospital (Memphis, Tennessee)|St. Joseph's Hospital]], where doctors opened his chest and performed [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]]. He never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead at 7:05&amp;nbsp;p.m. 
Paul Hess, assistant administrator at St. Joseph's Hospital, where Dr. King died despite emergency surgery, said the minister had "received a gunshot wound on the right side of the neck, at the root of the neck, a gaping wound. He was pronounced dead at 7:05 P.M. Central standard time (8:05 P.M. New York time) by staff doctors," Mr. Hess said. "They did everything humanly possible." 
According to Taylor Branch, his autopsy revealed that despite being aged just 39, his heart was in the condition of a 60-year-old man, which Branch attributed to the stress of his 13 years in the Civil Rights Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/mlk/filmmore/pt.html|title=Citizen King'|work=[[American Experience]]|publisher=[[PBS]]|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==

===Coretta Scott King===
Mrs. King had difficulty settling her children with the news that their father was deceased. She received a large number of telegrams, including one from [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]'s mother, which she regarded as the one that touched her the most.{{sfn|Clarke|2007|page=124}}

===Within the movement===
For some, King's assassination meant the end of the strategy of [[nonviolence]].&lt;ref name=NYTnonviolence&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0115.html|title=Martin Luther King Jr.: Leader of Millions in Nonviolent Drive for Racial Justice|accessdate=October 19, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=April 5, 1968|first=Murray|last=Schumach}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others in the movement reaffirmed the need to carry on King's and the movement's work.

===Robert F. Kennedy speech===
{{Main|Robert F. Kennedy's speech on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.}}

That night, Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]], running to gain the presidential nomination to represent the Democratic Party, spoke about the assassination. Kennedy had spoken earlier that day in Indiana{{sfn|Klein|2006|page=2}} and learned about the shooting before boarding a plane to [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]]. He had a speech scheduled there in a predominantly black neighborhood of the city. His press secretary [[Frank Mankiewicz]] suggested he ask the audience to pray for the King family and to follow King's practice of nonviolence.{{sfn|Klein|2006|page=3}} Kennedy did not learn King had died until he landed in Indianapolis.

Mankiewicz and speechwriter Adam Walinsky drafted notes for Kennedy's use, but he refused them, using some he likely had written during the ride to the site.{{sfn|Klein|2007|3–4}} The Indianapolis chief of police advised Kennedy he could not provide protection and was worried he would be at risk in talking about the death of the revered leader.&lt;ref name="Scarborough"&gt;[http://www.joescarborough.com/view.asp?ID=31 Scarborough Country] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025062559/http://www.joescarborough.com/view.asp?ID=31 |date=October 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy decided to go ahead. Standing on a flatbed truck, Kennedy spoke for four minutes and fifty-seven seconds.{{sfn|Klein|2006|pages=1, 4}}

He was the first to tell the audience King had died; some of the attendees screamed and wailed in grief. Several of Kennedy's aides were worried that the delivery of this information would result in a riot.&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klein|first=Joe|url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/klein/article/0,9565,1181593,00.html|title=Pssst!

He said: "For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man." These remarks surprised his aides, who had never heard him speak publicly of his brother's death.{{sfn|Klein|2007|page=6}} Kennedy said the country had to make an effort to "go beyond these rather difficult times", and quoted a poem by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] playwright [[Aeschylus]], "Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God." In conclusion, he said the country needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the audience members to pray for the King family and the country, quoting the Greeks again.

His speech was credited in part with preventing post-assassination rioting in Indianapolis, on a night where such events broke out in major cities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indygov.org/eGov/Mayor/PR/2006/4/20060404b.htm Statement of Mayor Bart Peterson] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114222940/http://www.indygov.org/eGov/Mayor/PR/2006/4/20060404b.htm |date=November 14, 2007 }} April 4, 2006, press release&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered one of the greatest speeches in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 100 American Speeches of the 20th Century|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/007256296x/77464/top100_only.html|accessdate=August 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy subsequently canceled all of his scheduled campaign appearances and withdrew to his hotel room.

He assigned Attorney General [[Ramsey Clark]] to investigate the assassination in Memphis. He made a personal call to King's wife, [[Coretta Scott King]], and declared April 7 a [[national day of mourning]], on which the U.S. flag would be flown at half-staff.{{sfn|Kotz|2006|page=415}}

===Riots===
{{Main|King assassination riots}}
Colleagues of King in the Civil Rights Movement called for a nonviolent response to the assassination, to honor his most deeply held beliefs. [[James Farmer Jr.]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dr. King would be greatly distressed to find that his blood had triggered off bloodshed and disorder. I think instead the nation should be quiet; black and white, and we should be in a prayerful mood, which would be in keeping with his life. We should make that kind of dedication and commitment to the goals which his life served to solving the domestic problems. That's the memorial, that's the kind of memorial we should build for him. It's just not appropriate for there to be violent retaliations, and that kind of demonstration in the wake of the murder of this pacifist and man of peace.&lt;ref name="1968 Year In Review, UPI.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1968/Martin-Luther-King-Assasination/12303153093431-4/|title=News, Photos, Audio - Archives - UPI.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the more militant [[Stokely Carmichael]] called for forceful action, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;White America killed Dr. King last night. She made it a whole lot easier for a whole lot of black people today. There no longer needs to be intellectual discussions, black people know that they have to get guns. White America will live to cry that she killed Dr. King last night. It would have been better if she had killed [[Rap Brown]] and/or [[Stokely Carmichael]], but when she killed Dr. King, she lost.&lt;ref name="1968 Year In Review, UPI.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the urging for calm by many leaders, a nationwide wave of [[Mass racial violence in the United States|riots]] erupted in more than 100 cities.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=1968: Martin Luther King shot dead|work=On This Day|publisher=[[BBC News]]|year=2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/4/newsid_2453000/2453987.stm|accessdate=September 17, 2006|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the assassination, the city of Memphis quickly settled the strike on favorable terms to the sanitation workers.&lt;ref name="AFSCME-WEB3"&gt;{{cite web|title=AFSCME Wins in Memphis |work=[[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees|AFSCME]] |publisher=[[AFL–CIO]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |date=April 1, 1968 |url=http://www.afscme.org/about/1533.cfm |accessdate=December 23, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206211308/http://www.afscme.org/about/1533.cfm |archivedate=December 6, 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSCME-WEB4"&gt;{{cite web|title=1968 Memphis Sanitation Workers' Strike Chronology |work=[[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees|AFSCME]] |publisher=[[AFL–CIO]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |year=1968 |url=http://www.afscme.org/about/1548.cfm |accessdate=December 23, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206211158/http://www.afscme.org/about/1548.cfm |archivedate=December 6, 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Garment workers listen to funeral service for MLK on portable radio April 8 1968.jpg|thumb|Garment workers listen to the funeral service for Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on a portable radio. April 9, 1968]]

On April 8, King's widow, [[Coretta Scott King]], together with the couple's four small children, led a crowd estimated at 40,000 in a silent march through the streets of Memphis to honor the fallen leader and support the cause of the city's black sanitation workers.&lt;ref name="digital"/&gt;

The next day, funeral rites for King were held in his hometown of [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The service at [[Ebenezer Baptist Church (Atlanta, Georgia)|Ebenezer Baptist Church]] was nationally televised, as were these other events. A funeral procession transported King's body for 3.5 miles through the streets of Atlanta, followed by more than 100,000 mourners, from the church to his alma mater of [[Morehouse College]]. A second service was held there before the burial.&lt;ref name="digital"&gt;[http://crdl.usg.edu/events/mlk_assassination/?Welcome "Dr. King's Assassination: Background"], Civil Rights Digital Library, Digital Library of Georgia, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of King's assassination, journalists reported some callous or hostile reactions from parts of white America, particularly in the [[American South|South]]. [[David Halberstam]], who reported on King's funeral, recounted a comment heard at an affluent white dinner party:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the wives—station wagon, three children, forty-five-thousand-dollar house—leaned over and said, "I wish you had spit in his face for me." It was a stunning moment; I wondered for a long time afterwards what King could possibly have done to her, in what conceivable way he could have threatened her, why this passionate hate.&lt;ref name=MED08/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reporters recounted that many whites were also grief-stricken at the leader's death. In some cases, the shock of events altered opinions. A survey later sent to a group of college trustees revealed their opinions of King had risen after his assassination.&lt;ref name=MED08 /&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised King in an editorial, calling his murder a "national disaster" and his cause "just".&lt;ref name=NYTneed&gt;{{cite news|title='The Need of All Humanity'|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=April 5, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SD&gt;{{cite web|last=Catalyst|title=White America's reaction to the shooting of MLK?|url=http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showpost.php?s=83c87316412df8355c276ee759f16c59&amp;p=6774594&amp;postcount=16|publisher=Straight Dope|accessdate=July 20, 2012|date=November 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public figures generally praised King in the days following his death. Others expressed political ideology. [[Governor of Alabama|Governor]] [[George Wallace]] of Alabama, known as a segregationist, described the assassination as a "senseless, regrettable act".&lt;ref name=NYTnonviolence /&gt; But [[List of Governors of Georgia|Governor]] [[Lester Maddox]] of Georgia called King "an enemy of our country" and threatened to "personally raise" the state capitol flag back from half-staff. California [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Ronald Reagan]] described the assassination as "a great tragedy that began when we began compromising with law and order and people started choosing which laws they'd break". [[Strom Thurmond]], South Carolina [[List of United States Senators from South Carolina|Senator]], wrote to his constituents: "We are now witnessing the whirlwind sowed years ago when some preachers and teachers began telling people that each man could be his own judge in his own case."{{sfn|Perlstein|2009|page=257}}

==FBI investigation==
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] was assigned the lead to investigate King's death. [[J. Edgar Hoover]], who had previously made efforts to undermine King's reputation, told Johnson his agency would attempt to find the culprit(s).{{sfn|Kotz|2006|page=415}} Many documents related to this investigation remain classified, and are slated to remain secret until 2027.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In 2010, as in earlier years, some argued for passage of a proposed [[Martin Luther King Jr. Records Collection Act|Records Collection Act]], similar to a [[President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992|1992 law]] concerning the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy assassination]], in order to require the immediate release of the records.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The measure did not pass.

==Funeral==
{{main|Funeral of Martin Luther King Jr.}}
A crowd of 300,000 attended his funeral on April 9.{{sfn|Kotz|2006|page=415}} Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] attended on behalf of Johnson, who was at a meeting on the Vietnam War at [[Camp David]]. (There were fears that Johnson might be hit with protests and abuses over the war if he attended). At his widow's request, King's last sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church was played at the funeral; it was a recording of his "Drum Major" sermon, given on February 4, 1968. In that sermon, he asked that, at his funeral, no mention of his awards and honors be made, but that it be said he tried to "feed the hungry", "clothe the naked", "be right on the [Vietnam] war question", and "love and serve humanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_drum_major_instinct_1968/index.html | title=Drum Major Instinct (1968) |encyclopedia=Martin Luther King Jr. and the Global Freedom Struggle | publisher=[[Stanford University]] |access-date=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capture and guilty plea===
The FBI investigation found fingerprints on various objects left in the bathroom from where the gunfire had come. Evidence included a Remington Gamemaster rifle from which at least one shot had been fired. The fingerprints were traced to an escaped convict named James Earl Ray.&lt;ref name=mlkassassin&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/03/28/mlk.ray.case/index.html|title=The case against James Earl Ray|first=James|last=Polk|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|date=December 29, 2008|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after assassinating King, Ray was captured at [[London]]'s [[Heathrow Airport]] while he was trying to depart from the [[United Kingdom]] for either [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Rhodesia]], or [[Apartheid|apartheid South Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gb2AwFMso9UC&amp;pg=PA296&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;ots=PXCtNMafRF&amp;sig=iBF3veEDQIZMCWWWbiJBP7MBA68|title=Defining Danger: American Assassins and the New Domestic Terrorists|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|last=Clarke|first=James W.|location=[[Piscataway, New Jersey]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0765803412}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a false [[Canadian passport]] in the name of Ramon George Sneyd.{{sfn|Borrell|1968|page=2}} Ray was quickly extradited to Tennessee and charged with King's murder.

Ray confessed to the assassination on March 10, 1969. On the advice of his [[Lawyer|attorney]] [[Percy Foreman]], Ray took a guilty plea to avoid a conviction and potential [[death penalty]]. Ray was sentenced to a 99-year prison term; he recanted his confession three days later.&lt;ref name=recant&gt;{{cite news|last=Jerome|first=Richard|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20125261,00.html|title=Dead Silence|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=May 11, 1998|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray fired Foreman as his attorney and claimed a man he met in [[Montreal]] with the alias "Raul" was involved, as was Ray's brother Johnny, but that he was not. He said through his new attorney [[Jack Kershaw]] that, although he did not "personally shoot King", he may have been "partially responsible without knowing it", hinting at a conspiracy. In May 1977, Kershaw presented evidence to the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] that he believed exonerated his client, but tests did not prove conclusive. Kershaw also claimed Ray was somewhere else when the shots were fired, but he could not find a witness to corroborate the claim.&lt;ref name=Kershaw&gt;{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/us/24kershaw.html|title=Jack Kershaw Is Dead at 96; Challenged Conviction in King's Death|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=September 24, 2010|accessdate=September 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Cites paragraph. --&gt;

===Escape===
Ray and seven other convicts escaped from [[Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary]] in [[Petros, Tennessee]], on June 10, 1977. They were recaptured on June 13, three days later, and returned to prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://knoxville.fbi.gov/hist.htm FIELD OFFICE ESTABLISHED] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524142603/http://knoxville.fbi.gov/hist.htm |date=May 24, 2008 }} Knoxville Field Office, FBI.&lt;/ref&gt; A year was added to Ray's sentence.

Ray worked for the remainder of his life attempting (unsuccessfully) to withdraw his guilty plea and secure a full trial. In 1997, King's son [[Dexter King|Dexter]] met with Ray; he publicly supported Ray's efforts to obtain a [[retrial]].&lt;ref name="CNN2"&gt;{{cite news|title=James Earl Ray, convicted King assassin, dies|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]]([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|date=April 23, 1998|url=http://edition.cnn.com/US/9804/23/ray.obit/#2|accessdate=September 17, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061029154237/http://edition.cnn.com/US/9804/23/ray.obit/|archivedate=October 29, 2006|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Francis Pepper]] remained James Earl Ray's attorney until Ray's death. He carried on the effort to gain a trial on behalf of the King family, who do not believe Ray was responsible, but that there was a conspiracy by elements of the government against King.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thekingcenter.org/news/trial.html#Statement KING FAMILY STATEMENT ON THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT "LIMITED INVESTIGATION" OF THE MLK ASSASSINATION] The King Center&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Ray died in prison on April 23, 1998, at the age of 70 from kidney and liver failure, caused by [[hepatitis C]] (probably contracted as a result of a [[blood transfusion]] given after a [[stabbing]] while at [[Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary]]).

==Conspiracy theories==

===Loyd Jowers===
{{anchor|Loyd Jowers and conspiracy}}
In December 1993, [[Loyd Jowers]], a white man from Memphis, appeared on ABC's ''[[Prime Time Live]].'' He had gained attention by claiming an alleged conspiracy involving the Mafia, the Federal government, and himself to kill King. According to Jowers, Ray was a scapegoat, and not directly involved in the shooting. Jowers claimed he hired someone to kill King as a favor for a friend in the [[mafia]], Frank Liberto, a produce merchant who died before 1993.

According to the Department of Justice, Jowers had inconsistently identified different people as King's assassin since 1993. He had alternatively claimed the shooter was: (1) an African American man who was on South Main Street on the night of the assassination (the "Man on South Main Street"); (2) Raoul; (3) a white "Lieutenant" with the Memphis Police Department; and (4) a person whom he did not recognize. The Department does not consider Jowers' accusations credible, and refers to two of the accused individuals by pseudonym.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Because [The Department of Justice] does not credit Jowers' inconsistent allegations, we refer to the two assassins he has named as the "Man on South Main Street" and the "Lieutenant", respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; DOJ has stated the evidence allegedly supporting the existence of a third assassin, "Raoul", is dubious.&lt;ref name=DOJMLK&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/mlk/part1.php#toc "United States Department of Justice Investigation of Recent Allegations Regarding the Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr"].

====''Coretta Scott King v. Loyd Jowers''====

In 1997, King's son [[Dexter King|Dexter]] had a meeting with Ray and asked him, "I just want to ask you, for the record, um, did you kill my father?"  Ray replied, "No. No I didn't," and King told Ray he, along with the King family, believed him; the King family also urged that Ray be granted a new trial.&lt;ref name=book&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LDpmCpVl0A John Ray (brother of James Earl) on Fox] at YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFMorg1jhPM Today in History March 27] at YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sack|first=Kevin|title=Dr. King's Son Says Family Believes Ray Is Innocent|date=March 28, 1997|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/28/us/dr-king-s-son-says-family-believes-ray-is-innocent.html|accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the King family filed a [[civil case]] against Jowers and unnamed co-conspirators for the [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] of King.&lt;!--&lt;ref group=note&gt;''[[Coretta Scott King v.

Loyd Jowers|Coretta Scott King, et al. vs. Loyd Jowers et al.]]'', Case No. 97242, was tried in the circuit court of Shelby County, Tennessee, from November 15 to December 8, 1999.

Attorney [[William Francis Pepper]], representing the King family, presented evidence from 70 witnesses and 4,000 pages of transcripts. Pepper alleges in his book, ''An Act of State'' (2003), that the evidence implicated the FBI, the CIA, the Army, the Memphis Police Department, and organized crime in the murder of King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Act-State-Execution-Martin-Luther/dp/1859846955|last=Pepper|first=William F.|authorlink=William F.

Accessed January 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

After hearing no evidence from the government, and only testimony and pleadings cooperatively submitted by the plaintiffs and Jowers, the jury—six blacks and six whites—found King had been the victim of assassination by a conspiracy involving the Memphis police as well as federal agencies. Local Assistant District Attorney John Campbell, who was not involved in the case, said the case was flawed and "overlooked so much contradictory evidence that never was presented."&lt;ref name="Emily"&gt;{{cite news|last=Yellin|first=Emily|title=Memphis Jury Sees Conspiracy in Martin Luther King's Killing|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=December 9, 1999|accessdate=June 8, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/09/us/memphis-jury-sees-conspiracy-in-martin-luther-king-s-killing.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This civil verdict against Jowers has been claimed by some persons to have established Ray's criminal innocence, which the King family has always maintained, but it has no bearing on his having pleaded guilty.

In 1998, CBS reported the two separate ballistic tests conducted on the Remington Gamemaster allegedly used by Ray in the assassination were inconclusive.&lt;ref name="CBS-WEB1"&gt;{{cite news |title=James Earl Ray Dead At 70 |publisher=[[CBS]] |date=April 23, 1998 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/04/23/national/main7900.shtml |accessdate=December 23, 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061212203833/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/04/23/national/main7900.shtml|archivedate=December 12, 2006 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-WEB1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Questions left hanging by James Earl Ray's death |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=April 23, 1998 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/82893.stm|accessdate=December 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, witnesses with King at the moment of the shooting say the shot was fired from a different location; from behind thick shrubbery near the rooming house, and not from a window of the rooming house.&lt;ref name="AO-WEB2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Martin Luther King - Sniper in the Shrubbery? |publisher=africanaonline.com |year=2006 |url=http://www.africanaonline.com/mlk_shrubbery.htm |accessdate=December 23, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606035126/http://www.africanaonline.com/mlk_shrubbery.htm|archivedate=June 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King's friend and SCLC organizer, Reverend [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], has suggested the impending occupation of Washington, DC, by the [[Poor People's Campaign]] was a primary motive for the assassination.&lt;ref name=Douglass2000/&gt; Lawson also noted during the civil trial that King alienated President Johnson and other powerful government actors when he repudiated the [[Vietnam War]] on April 4, 1967—exactly one year before the assassination.&lt;ref name=transcript /&gt;

King had been targeted by [[COINTELPRO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/08/opinion/oe-jalon8| author=Allan M. Jalon| title=A break-in to end all break-ins| work=Los Angeles Times| date=March 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had also been under surveillance by military intelligence agencies during the period leading up to his assassination under the code name Operation Lantern Spike.{{sfn|United States Congress|2002|page=15235}}

A church minister, Ronald Denton Wilson, claimed his father, Henry Clay Wilson, assassinated Martin Luther King Jr., not James Earl Ray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/05/us/a-minister-says-his-father-now-dead-killed-dr-king-403377.html|title=A Minister Says His Father, Now Dead, Killed Dr. King|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=April 6, 2002|accessdate=December 29, 2008|first=Dana|last=Canedy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated, "It wasn't a racist thing; he thought Martin Luther King was connected with communism, and he wanted to get him out of the way." But Wilson had reportedly previously admitted his father was a member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news|last=Canedy|first=Dana|title=My father killed King, says pastor, 34 years on|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=April 6, 2002|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/04/06/1017206269495.html|accessdate=September 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Jesse Jackson]], who was with King when he was assassinated, noted:

{{quote|The fact is there were saboteurs to disrupt the march. [And] within our own organization, we found a very key person who was on the government payroll.

According to biographer Taylor Branch, King's friend and colleague [[James Bevel]] put it more bluntly:  "There is no way a ten-cent white boy could develop a plan to kill a million-dollar black man."{{sfn|Branch|2007|page=770}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7124">'''Brain-body interactions''' are patterns of neural activity in the [[central nervous system]] to coordinate the activity between the brain and body. The nervous system consists of [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] nervous systems and coordinates the actions of an animal by transmitting [[Action potential|signals]] to and from different parts of its body. The [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]] are interwoven with the body and interact with other [[organ system]]s through the [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]], [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] and [[Enteric nervous system|enteric]] nervous systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freund|first=Patrick|last2=Friston|first2=Karl|last3=Thompson|first3=Alan J.|last4=Stephan|first4=Klaas E.|last5=Ashburner|first5=John|last6=Bach|first6=Dominik R.|last7=Nagy|first7=Zoltan|last8=Helms|first8=Gunther|last9=Draganski|first9=Bogdan|date=2016|title=Embodied neurology: an integrative framework for neurological disorders|journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology|volume=139|issue=Pt 6|pages=1855–1861|doi=10.1093/brain/aww076|issn=1460-2156|pmc=4892755|pmid=27105896|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neural pathway]]s regulate brain-body interactions and allow to [[Interoception|sense]] and [[Motor control|control]] its body and interact with the environment.

== Types of interactions ==
Various types of brain-body interactions have been distinguished.

'''Clarissa Chapman Armstrong''' (May 15, 1805 – July 20, 1891) was an American missionary in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and [[Marquesas Islands]], from 1832 until 1847. She was part of the Fifth Company of missionaries sent to Hawaii by the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] (ABCFM).

==Early life==
Clarissa Chapman was born and raised on a farm in [[Russell, Massachusetts]]. Her father was "crippled by rheumatism" and she remembered assisting him in farm work.&lt;ref name="Ludlow"&gt;Helen W. Ludlow, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv5BAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;ots=SmZcB4Ey9v&amp;dq=Clarissa%20Chapman%20Armstrong&amp;pg=PA255-IA3#v=onepage&amp;q=Clarissa%20Chapman%20Armstrong&amp;f=false "Clarissa Chapman Armstrong"] in Hiram Collins Haydn, ed., ''American Heroes on Mission Fields: Brief Missionary Biographies'' (American Tract Society 1894): 255-298.&lt;/ref&gt; She trained as a teacher. Her brother was [[Reuben Atwater Chapman]], a judge in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="Engs"&gt;Robert Francis Engs, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zB1IIBd3_EwC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;ots=uc2Q16C4lo&amp;dq=Clarissa%20Chapman%20Armstrong&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=Clarissa%20Chapman%20Armstrong&amp;f=false ''Educating the Disfranchised and Disinherited: Samuel Chapman Armstrong and Hampton Institute, 1839–1893''] (University of Tennessee Press 1999). {{ISBN|9781572330511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission work==
Clarissa Chapman Armstrong sailed for Hawaii on a whaling ship in 1831, with her new husband, a Presbyterian minister.&lt;ref name="Ludlow" /&gt; They were part of the Fifth Company of missionaries sent to Hawaii by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). She was pregnant for the entire six-month journey. Her first child, Caroline, was born two months after the couple arrived, in [[Honolulu]]. The couple with [[Benjamin Wyman Parker|Benjamin]] and [[Mary Barker Parker]] were assigned as missionaries to [[Nuku Hiva]] in the Marquesas Islands from 1833 to 1834. Their first son was born there.&lt;ref name="Okihiro"&gt;Gary Y. Okihiro, [https://books.google.com/books?id=T7MwDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA239&amp;ots=67HaYTkl5d&amp;dq=Clarissa%20Chapman%20Armstrong&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q=Clarissa%20Chapman%20Armstrong&amp;f=false ''Island World: A History of Hawai’i and the United States''] (University of California Press 2009): 98-104. {{ISBN|9780520261679}}&lt;/ref&gt; The failure of the Marquesan mission prompted them to return to Hawaii.&lt;ref name="KjellgrenIvory2005" /&gt; They lived at [[Wailuku]] on Maui from 1835 to 1840, and then moved to Honolulu.&lt;ref name="Engs" /&gt; Clarissa Chapman Armstrong taught literacy and Bible study classes for women. She did not always enjoy living among the native residents of Hawaii, writing that "Week after week passes and we see nothing but naked, filthy, wicked heathen with souls as dark as the tabernacles which they inhabit."&lt;ref name="Okihiro" /&gt;

Armstrong also made watercolor sketches of native Marquesan and Hawaiian people and places.&lt;ref name="KjellgrenIvory2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Kjellgren|author2=Carol S.

Richard Armstrong left mission work in 1847 to take secular employment as the Minister of Public Instruction under [[King Kamehameha III]]. Clarissa Armstrong no longer taught classes, but continued to hold Bible study meetings, now with other wives of Hawaiian chiefs and government officials, including Queen [[Kalama]].&lt;ref name="Ludlow" /&gt; The Armstrongs lived in "the Stone House", a property of the Kingdom of Hawaii, which Clarissa kept as her residence after Richard's death in 1860. She sold the Honolulu house in 1881, and moved to [[San Francisco, California]], to join her daughter's work at a Christian mission in that city's Chinatown.&lt;ref name="Ludlow" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Clarissa Chapman married [[Richard Armstrong (Hawaii)|Richard Armstrong]] on September 5, 1831, in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. They had ten children.

'''Coeurl''' is a fictional [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] race of predators created by [[List of science fiction authors|science fiction novelist]] [[A. E. van Vogt]] (1912–2000) and featured in his first published short story "Black Destroyer" (1939), later incorporated in the novel ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'' (1950). The species' appearance is comparable to a large [[cat]], except in that its forelegs are twice as long as its hind legs, and it possesses [[tentacles]] attached to its shoulders that terminate in [[suction cup]]s. Its skin coloration is not mentioned (except as implied by the title), but was depicted as black in the cover art for its original magazine appearance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vanvogt.www4.mmedia.is/images/large/Astounding%20Science%20Fiction%20July%201939%20--Black%20Destroyer.jpg |title=Astounding Science Fiction July 1939 --Black Destroyer.jpg (350×490) |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019213439/http://vanvogt.www4.mmedia.is/images/large/Astounding%20Science%20Fiction%20July%201939%20--Black%20Destroyer.jpg |archive-date=2010-10-19 |access-date= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It sustains itself by feeding upon a substance it calls the ''Id'' of other beings.

The species appears indifferent to environment and can survive in different [[atmosphere]]s. It can manipulate [[electromagnetic radiation|EM radiation]] (referred to as "electric vibrations" in the story) at will and seems to communicate via that method.

==Creation==
In "Black Destroyer", a sentient creature that calls itself Coeurl lives on an alien planet. When a human [[starship]] arrives, they find a Coeurl but assume it is an unintelligent animal, and even allow it to come on board. The Coeurl realizes it can feed on humans but plays along in order to learn more about them and their ship. Eventually, however, it kills and feeds on one of the ship's crew. The crew suspects the Coeurl did it and tries to prove it by feeding the creature organically bound [[phosphorus]] similar to that in the victim's bones, but the Coeurl is smart enough to pass the test. It is later found out and tries to escape, but it is no match for the humans' technology, and in the end commits suicide.

When "Black Destroyer" was incorporated into ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'', several changes were made in Coeurl's anatomy and physiology—for example, Coeurl's tentacles originally ended in tentacled [[finger]]s, but were changed in the novel to suction cups, and the dietary chemical was changed from phosphorus to [[potassium]].  In the novel, it is theorized that the members of Coeurl's race were pets or servants of the original inhabitants of the planet.

== Other appearances ==
* [[Final Fantasy bestiary (A-E)#Coeurl|Coeurl]] appear as feline enemies in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, usually with enlarged tentacle-like whiskers. They are usually associated with the "Blaster" attack, which causes dangerous status effects at random, usually paralysis or instant death.
* The [[displacer beast]] in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]] was inspired by the coeurl,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ridureyu.tripod.com/ggygax.html |title=ggygax.html |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308031559/http://ridureyu.tripod.com/ggygax.html |archive-date=2007-03-08 |access-date= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; being a large feline with shoulder tentacles.
* The [[Dirty Pair]] have a Coeurl named Mughi as a sidekick.
* Coeurls inhabit Mount Zoaka in the MUD ''[[Lusternia]]''.
* A combat droid used by the lead character in [[David Gerrold]]'s novel ''[[A Season for Slaughter]]'' is similarly catlike and vocalises the word "Coeurl" when it is on standby and awaiting further orders.
* Also by David Gerrold in his ''[[Star Trek]]'' novel ''The Galactic Whirlpool'', the lieutenant Kevin Riley uses holographic creatures as part of a disorientating tactic during a commandeering action, of which the "prowlers" use the same "Coeurl" vocalisation. 
* The ''[[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game]]'' was able to secure permission for a single use of Van Vogt's original Coeurl in the adventure booklet ''The End of Eternity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Coeurl|title=Coeurl – PathfinderWiki|work=pathfinderwiki.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the Liar-soft [[Visual Novel]] ''Sekien no Inganock ~ What a Beautiful People'', mutated "fantastic humans" whose mutations changed their body parts to those of cats are referred to as Coeurl.
* In the MMORPG ''[[Guild Wars 2]]'', colocals are a type of enemy that resembles a Coeurl and can be found in various zones across the game world.
* In the anime muv-luv alternative: Total Eclipse, episode 18 The sound of twisted wings, there is a moving van with the logo containing a red and yellow coeurl with the words COEURL EXPRESS stamped on the side.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="649">In [[law]], a '''comminatory''' is a [[clause]] inserted into a law, [[edict]], [[patent]], etc., describing a [[punishment]] that is to be imposed on delinquents, which, however, is not in practice executed with the rigor that is conveyed in the description, or not even executed at all.

Thus, in some countries, when an exile is enjoined not to return on pain of death, it is deemed a comminatory penalty, since, if he did return, it is not strictly executed, but instead the same threat is laid on him again, which is more than comminatory.

'''Daniel A. Vallero''' is an American environmental author&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.elsevier.com/Daniel-Vallero/ELS_1007685/ Author page at Elsevier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470259603.fmatter/summary/ Author page at John Wiley &amp; Sons]&lt;/ref&gt; and scientist. He was born in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]] and grew up in [[Collinsville, Illinois]]. He received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in city and regional planning from [[Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville]].  He also earned a masters in civil and environmental engineering (environmental health sciences) from the [[University of Kansas]] and a PhD in civil and environmental engineering from [[Duke University]] with a thesis on "“Dicarboximide Fungicide Flux to the Lower Troposphere from an Aquic Hapludult Soil”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cee.duke.edu/faculty/daniel-vallero Faculty page at Duke]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fds.duke.edu/db/pratt/cee/faculty/daniel.vallero/files/CV.pdf Curriculum vitae at Duke]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Vallero is recognized internationally for advancing the state of environmental science and engineering, as an author, educator, engineer and scientific researcher. He has appeared on news and other shows, recently discussing [[plastic recycling]] on NBC's [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]] (http://www.today.com/video/today/51620316) and on [[MSNBC]], and current state of ethics in research at universities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/articles/2012/05/31/ethics-courses-trending-at-graduate-engineering-schools?page=2 U.S. News &amp; World Report]&lt;/ref&gt; He began his professional career in the Kansas City regional office of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1976 and has worked in numerous other scientific venues since then.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-05/documents/vallero_daniel_sed.pdf Researcher page at EPA]&lt;/ref&gt; He directed the Science, Technology and Human Values Program at [[Duke University]] from 1997 to 2005. Beginning in 2005, he has been  adjunct Professor of  Engineering Ethics at  Duke University, with a joint appointment in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and  the Trinity School of Arts and Sciences. He held appointments also at the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City]], [[North Carolina Central University]], and as science staff member on Energy and Power Subcommittee of the [[United States House of Representatives]].
 
In his books and other writings, Vallero has taken the systems view of living systems, As such he has bridged [[biomedical engineering]] with [[environmental engineering]]. He stresses the need to incorporate the [[social sciences]] into every engineering and design project.  As a leader in [[engineering ethics]], he has served the [[National Academy of Engineering]] as a member of the Online Ethics Committee and the Executive Board of the National Institute of Engineering Ethics. Vallero has also advised [[Sigma Xi]], universities and other institutions on science and [[research ethics]] and the responsible conduct of research (RCR).

Vallero is editor for the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]]' journal, ''Process Safety and Environmental Protection'', as well as the [[MDPI]] journal, ''Sustainability''. He is also the environmental engineering subject editor of the [[McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology]] and the ''McGraw-Hill Yearbook of Science &amp; Technology''.

== Works ==

Vallero is a pioneer of [[green engineering]] and the application of [[life cycle analysis]] to engineering design. He was among the first to question the sustainability and ethics of using corn as a source of ethanol fuel. His reasoning was that current farming practice's dependence on fossil fuels needed to grow (including fertilizer and pesticides), harvest and ferment the corn is highly inefficient thermodynamically. The use of corn for fuel is especially problematic, since only the seed are used, not to mention the misuse of an important part of the global food supply.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008). Teaching green engineering: The case of ethanol life cycle analysis. Bulletin of
Science, Technology &amp; Society. 28 (3): 236-243.&lt;/ref&gt; Vallero argued that other crops are much more sustainable, especially those that make use of the whole plant, including cellulosic material, like [[switchgrass]] (Panicum virgatum).

In the book, "DUST: The inside Story of its Role in the September 11th Aftermath," &lt;ref&gt;P.J. Lioy (2010). DUST: The Inside Story of Its Role in the September 11th Aftermath (Forward By Tom Kean). Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield. {{ISBN|1-4422-0148-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the late American scientist [[Paul Lioy]] credited Vallero with leading the way to sampling of hazardous air pollutants in and around Ground Zero following the [[9/11]] attacks on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. Lioy collaborated with Vallero in establishing a protocol for characterizing exposure in risk assessments following such emergencies. Lioy and Vallero coined the term “5 R’s” to delineate how exposure assessment varies during the five stages following a disaster: 1. Rescue; 2. Recovery; 3. Reentry; 4. Restoration; and 5. Rehabitation.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero  and P. Lioy (2012). The 5-R’s: Reliable Post-Disaster Exposure Assessment. Leadership and Management and Engineering. 12 (4):  247-253. (October 2012). {{DOI|10.1061/(ASCE)LM.1943-5630.0000200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With architect, Chris Brasier, Vallero coined the term "synthovation," as a new design process for green engineering and [[green architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of synthesis and innovation, sustainable design does not consider innovation to be an interruption (feedback loop) to the design process as in traditional "concept to completion" design. Rather, innovations are to be expected and integrated. Differing from the traditional step-wise process, synthovation is a spiral, dynamic, and continuously moving process toward completion of the design and throughout the life of the project, including end-of life recycling and design for disassembly, a component of [[design for environment]] (DfE), with innovations added along the way that will increase the [[sustainability]] of the project over its entire [[Enterprise life cycle|life cycle]].

In her book, "Hormone Deception",&lt;ref&gt;L. Berkson (2010), Hormone Deception. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; 1 edition, {{ISBN|1453741275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsey Berkson credits Vallero as among the first to apply [[exposure science]] to [[endocrine disruptors]].

'''Elizabeth Aldworth''' (1693/1695&lt;ref group = "note"&gt;''AQC'' and ''Memoir'' both indicate a birthdate of 1693, while the cathedral plaque indicates 1695.&lt;/ref&gt;–1773/1775&lt;ref group = "note" name = "ex02"&gt;''AQC'' indicates 1773, ''Memoir'' and the cathedral plaque both indicate 1775.&lt;/ref&gt;), born '''Elizabeth St Leger''', was known in her time as "The Lady Freemason" and was the first recorded woman to be initiated into Regular [[Freemasonry]].

She was the daughter of [[Arthur St Leger, 1st Viscount Doneraile]], of [[Doneraile]] Court, [[County Cork]], Ireland.&lt;ref name="memoir"&gt;Day, John, ed. ''The Memoir of the Lady Freemason.'' Cork: Guy &amp; Co., 1914.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} She was married in 1713 to Richard Aldworth, Esq.,&lt;ref name="memoir"/&gt;{{rp|7}} in Newmarket.&lt;ref&gt;Lewistown Gazette (Lewistown, PA USA) February 16, 1860 Pg. 1 Col. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; During the duration of the Hon. Elizabeth Aldworth—‘Whenever a benefit was given at the theaters in Dublin or Cork for the Masonic Female Orphan Asylum, she walked at the head of the Freemasons with her apron and other insignia of Freemasonary, and sat in the front row of the stage box. The house was always crowded on these occasions. Her portrait is in the lodge-room of almost every lodge of Ireland.’&lt;ref&gt;Ibid 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Initiation==
The date of her initiation into Freemasonry is uncertain, but the ''Memoir of a Lady Freemason'' indicates that it was between 1710–1712, before her marriage. In his paper in ''Ars Quatuor Coronatorum'' in 1895, Edward Conder states that it was sometime between 1710–1718.&lt;ref name = "AQC"&gt;Conder, Edward. [http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/aqc/aldworth.html "The Hon. Miss St. Leger and Freemasonry"]. The Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon.  Reprinted with permission from ''Ars Quatuor Coronatorum: the Transactions of Quatuor Coronati Lodge No. 2076, UGLE'', vol. viii (1895), pp. 16–23. Accessed 13 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a reply to the paper, Masonic scholar William James Hughan stated: "Until Bro. Conder’s investigations we had all assumed that the various reports respecting the initiation of the Hon. Elizabeth St. Leger, though not always in agreement, were correct as to the occurrence being of a later date than 1730."  Hughan also found the facts related to contradict the statements made by an Aldworth descendant.&lt;ref name = "AQC"/&gt;

Those facts are found in the ''Memoir'', extracted from the records of the First Lodge of Ireland, which state that Arundel Hill was present at the initiation and often sat in Lodge with her.&lt;ref name="memoir"/&gt;{{rp|8}}  The ''Memoir'''s editor also indicates that Conder's work was the first fixing of the date, which as of 1864 was not known.&lt;ref name="memoir"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

Conder also states that the particular Lodge in which she was initiated, while commonly thought at the time of his research to be known, is also unknown, but that it may have been a private Lodge warranted out of London by her father.&lt;ref name = "AQC"/&gt; Conder also seems to be refuting an unelaborated-upon statement that Aldworth was initiated after the formation of the [[Grand Lodge of Ireland]].  He indicates that since the Viscount died in 1727, she could not have been initiated after that point, and at that time it seems that the commonly accepted date of formation of the Grand Lodge was 1729–30.  It is now taken to be 1725.

The tradition of Aldworth's initiation is that Aldworth had fallen asleep while reading on a dim winter evening in the library, which was located next to the room in which the Lodge was meeting.  In consequence of construction going on in the library, she was woken by the voices she heard next door, and the light shining through the loose brickwork.  She removed some of the bricks and watched the proceedings.  When she understood the solemnity of the proceedings, she wished to retreat, but was caught by the Lodge [[Tyler (Masonic)|Tyler]], who was also the family butler.  Realizing her predicament, she screamed and fainted.  The tyler summoned the Brethren (among them her father), and they ultimately decided to initiate her into the Lodge.&lt;ref name = "AQC"/&gt;

==Later life and death==
[[Image:2005 FinbarreCathedral AldworthPlaque.jpg|thumb||250px|1775 burial in [[Saint Finbarre's Cathedral]]]]
{{Freemasonry}}
In the reply to Conder's presentation, a Bro. Rylands indicated that "there was no evidence forthcoming" that Aldworth served as Master of a Lodge, or that she regularly attended.&lt;ref name = "AQC"/&gt;
Elizabeth Aldworth died in 1775.  There was a plaque erected at the new St. Finbarre's Cathedral by the Masons of Cork, which reads:
&lt;center&gt;In Pious Memory of&lt;br&gt;

In [[cultural anthropology]], the distinction between a '''guilt society''' (or '''guilt culture'''), '''shame society''' (also '''shame culture''' or '''honor-shame culture'''), and a '''fear society''' (or [[culture of fear]]) has been used to categorize different cultures.  The differences can apply to how behavior is governed with respect to government laws, business rules, or social etiquette. This classification has been applied especially to [[Apollonian and Dionysian#In_anthropology|apollonian]] societies, sorting them according to the emotions they use to control individuals (especially children) and maintaining [[social order]], swaying them into norm obedience and conformity.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Alan [https://books.google.com/books?id=gqyiX6bg0TYC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161 ''Jews, Myth and History: A Critical Exploration of Contemporary Jewish Belief ''] p.161&lt;/ref&gt; 

* In a [[guilt society]], control is maintained by creating and continually reinforcing the feeling of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] (and the expectation of [[punishment]] now or in the [[afterlife]]) for certain condemned behaviors. The guilt-innocence world view focuses on law and punishment.  A person in this type of culture may ask, "Is my behavior fair or unfair?"{{fact|date=June 2018}}  This type of culture also emphasizes individual [[conscience]].&lt;ref name="DeMente96p79"/&gt; 
* In a shame society, the means of control is the [[inculcation]] of [[shame]] and the complementary threat of [[social rejection|ostracism]]. The shame-honor worldview seeks an "honor balance" and can lead to [[revenge#Revenge dynamics|revenge dynamics]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}  A person in this type of culture may ask, "Shall I look ashamed if I do X?" or "How people will look at me if I do Y?"  Shame cultures are typically based on the concepts of [[pride]] and [[honour]],&lt;ref name="LloydJones1983p26"&gt;Lloyd-Jones, Hugh (1983) [https://books.google.com/books?id=68j3DZ-a04YC&amp;pg=PA26 ''The Justice of Zeus'']&lt;/ref&gt; and appearances are what counts.
* In a fear society, control is kept by the [[fear]] of retribution. The fear-power worldview focuses on physical dominance.  A person in this culture may ask, "Will someone hurt me if I do this?"{{fact|date=January 2018}}

The terminology were popularized by [[Ruth Benedict]] in ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'', who described [[American culture]] as a "guilt culture" and [[Japanese culture]] as a "shame culture".&lt;ref&gt;Ezra F. Vogel, Foreword, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword (Boston: Houghton Mifflin 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ying and Wong. "Cultural Models of Shame and Guilt". ''Cultural Influences''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the same person may emphasize different considerations depending on the situation, government and business projects that bring together people from different types of cultures may experience problems.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==Guilt societies==

In a guilt society, the primary method of [[social control]] is the [[inculcation]] of feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] for behaviors that the individual believes to be undesirable. A prominent feature of guilt societies is the provision of sanctioned releases from guilt for certain behaviors, whether before or after the fact.  There is opportunity in such cases for authority figures to derive power, monetary and/or other advantages, etc. by manipulating the conditions of guilt and the forgiveness of guilt.

[[Paul Hiebert (missiologist)|Paul Hiebert]] characterizes the guilt society as follows:

:Guilt is a feeling that arises when we violate the absolute standards of [[morality]] within us, when we violate our conscience. A person may suffer from guilt although no one else knows of his or her misdeed; this feeling of guilt is relieved by confessing the misdeed and making restitution. True guilt cultures rely on an internalized conviction of sin as the enforcer of good behavior, not, as shame cultures do, on external sanctions. Guilt cultures emphasize punishment and forgiveness as ways of restoring the moral order; shame cultures stress self-denial and humility as ways of restoring the social order. (Hiebert 1985, 213)

==Geographical distribution==
* Guilt-Innocence: more associated with Catholicism and Judaism{{fact|date=June 2018}}
* Shame-Honour: more associated with Islam, Protestantism, and Eastern religions{{fact|date=June 2018}}
* Fear-Power: more associated with animist and tribal societies{{fact|date=June 2018}}

===England===
[[Anglo-Saxon England]] is particularly notable as a shame culture, and this trait survived even after [[Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England|its conversion to Christianity]], which is typically a guilt culture.&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Bjork, John D. Niles (1998) [https://books.google.com/books?id=SaFdpGdjvtoC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;lpg=PA285 ''A Beowulf Handbook''] p.285 quotation: {{quotation|The introduction of a new state-sanctioned (or ruler-sanctioned) religion does not necessarily effect radical changes in a culture's basic structure of values. Not only ''Beowulf'' but the ''Maxims'' of the Exeter Book — "Dom bib selast" (Fame is best, 80) — and  ''The Battle of Maldon'' attest to the vitality of the shame culture and its values in Anglo-Saxon England long after the Conversion. The theme of "worship" (i.e., Anglo-Saxon weordscipe [honor]) running through Malory's stories suggests that the ethos of the shame culture survived both the Conversion and the Conquest.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of shame culture under Christianity are the cultures of [[Mexico]],&lt;ref name="DeMente96p79"&gt;De Mente, Boye Lafayette (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=RL_UsrfTICoC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79 ''There's a Word for It in Mexico''] pp.79-80&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andalusia]]&lt;ref name="LloydJones1983p26"/&gt; and generally Christian [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean societies]].&lt;ref&gt;Satlow, Michael L. (1995) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XJjXAAAAMAAJ ''Tasting the dish: rabbinic rhetorics of sexuality''] p.142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odd Magne Bakke (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=cI1btFqWegoC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305 ''"Concord and Peace"''] p.305&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In China, the concept of shame is widely accepted&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bedford|first1=Olwen|title=Source:2014 Journal Citation Reports® (Thomson Reuters, 2015) The Individual Experience of Guilt and Shame in Chinese Culture|journal=Culture &amp; Psychology|date=2004|volume=10|issue=1|pages=29–52|doi=10.1177/1354067X04040929}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teachings. In ''[[Analects]]'', [[Confucius]] is quoted as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lead the people with administrative injunctions and put them in their place with penal law, and they will avoid punishments but will be without a sense of shame. Lead them with excellence and put them in their place through roles and ritual practices, and in addition to developing a sense of shame, they will order themselves harmoniously.&lt;ref&gt;Confucius, ''The Analects''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Japan ===
The society of traditional [[Japan]] was long held to be a good example of one in which shame is the primary agent of social control.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} The first book to cogently explain the workings of the Japanese society for the Western reader was ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' by [[Ruth Benedict]]. This book was produced under less than ideal circumstances since it was written during the early years of [[World War II]] in an attempt to understand the people who had become such a powerful enemy of the West. Under the conditions of war, it was impossible to do [[field research]] in Japan.

Without being able to study in Japan, Benedict relied on newspaper clippings, histories, literature, films, and interviews of [[Japanese-American]]s. Her studies came to conclusions about Japanese culture and society that are still widely criticized today, both in America and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kent|first=Pauline|title=Japanese Perceptions of The Chrysanthemum and the Sword|journal=Dialectical Anthropology|date=June 1999|volume=24|issue=2|pages=181–192|doi=10.1023/a:1007082930663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romani ===
To the [[Romani people|Roma]], though living as local minorities in mostly [[Christianity|Christian]] or [[Islam]]ic societies, the concept of ''lajav'' ("shame") is important, while the concept of ''bezax'' ("sin") does not have such significance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Delia Grigore]], ''Rromanipen-ul (rromani dharma) şi mistica familiei'' "Rromanipen (Rromani Dharma) and the Family Mystics" (2001, Salvaţi copiii, Bucharest)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haven Herefords''' is the oldest family run herd of [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford cattle]] in the world and is operated from the hamlet known as The Haven at [[Dilwyn]] in [[Herefordshire]], UK.

==Herd history==
[[File:T. Lewis - Hereford cattle breeder.png|thumb|left|Thomas Lewis - founder of The Haven herd]]

===Thomas Lewis===

One of the cows that they brought from ''The Woodhouse'' was Teresa 2nd, who founded the Tiny and Thrush families that are still prominent in the herd today.&lt;ref name="Watkins"/&gt; Among his most successful bulls during this period was Leyburn, a notable breeder of the day who produced a son, Haven Turgot, who was Champion at Hereford Show and Sale in 1917. Turgot was the first bull to be brought out by a Lady in Hereford Market, this being James Lewis' daughter as his son Edward was away at [[World War I]].
{{clearleft}}
===Edward Lewis===
Edward Lewis took over The Haven from his father, James, when he married Beatrice Francis in 1928. This being the period of the [[Great Depression]], the first ten years of his breeding was concentrated on survival and maintenance of the best attributes of the Hereford strain. He managed this by acquiring Free Town Bodyguard in 1946, a son of Bodyguard. Haven Victory was sold to Senor Duggan from Argentina in the February Show and Sale and Haven Broadside, another son of Bodyguard, was the first bull to make 1000 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] at the Hereford April Sale when sold to the [[Henry Pelham-Clinton-Hope, 9th Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]]. In 1948, Haven Idol, son of Tarington Magnate, was purchased by The Woodlands stud in Australia, where he proved to be an outstanding sire. [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|The Queen]] viewed the cattle at Hereford Market in this year.

===E. L. Lewis &amp; Son===
E. L. Lewis &amp; Son was formed in 1949 when Edward's son, Leslie,&lt;ref name=GlasgowHerald19760816&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=Glasgow Herald |date=16 August 1976 |title=Three judges at auction of Haven stock |first=Ian |last=Morrison |page=10 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qZFAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_6QMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=lewis%20haven%20hereford%20-milford%20-monty%20-kevin-lewis&amp;pg=4228%2C2845219|accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and daughter, Sybil, joined their father. Their first purchase was Shucknall Favourite, who proved to be one of the top breed sires for over a decade. Many of his progeny were exported throughout the world and were almost unbeatable in the show ring. The Haven acquired the female lines namely the Pinky, Prunella and Julia families formerly of the Vern herd and the Lady Lynda's of the Tarrington herd.

The ''[[Glasgow Herald]]'' reported that representative animals from the herd "swept the boards" at the [[Royal Highland Show]] of 1964 and "stole the show" at the 1965 event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=Glasgow Herald |date=23 June 1965 |title=Best Bull Display In Shorthorns: Entries From Haven Herefords Very Much To The Fore |page=16 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YG5AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iqMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2655%2C3847592 |accessdate=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the same newspaper noted that the herd was "internationally famous", with sales having been made to Canada, China, Egypt, Israel, Russia, South Africa and South America. It was also noted that Edward and Leslie Lewis had produced "many champion Herefords". At that time it was stated that on-the-farm auctions were planned to be an annual event.&lt;ref name=GlasgowHerald19760816/&gt;

'''Henry Ulke''' (January 29, 1821 – February 17, 1910) was an American photographer and portrait painter.

==Biography==
Henry Ulke was born in [[Brankenstein, Daxony|Brankenstein]], [[Prussia]],&lt;ref name=SIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Ulke Family, Ulke Family Papers, 1924, 1933, 1947 and undated|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_217579|work=SIA RU007424|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Archives]]|accessdate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied painting in [[Breslau]], and also in [[Berlin]] under [[Karl Wilhelm Wach|Wach]]. For a time he was occupied in decorating the Royal Museum of Berlin, but became involved in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in Germany|Revolution of 1848]], and was compelled to leave his native land.

Henry and his brothers Julian and Lee moved from Germany to the United States in 1852.  Henry worked in New York designing banknotes, then illustrations for [[Harper's Weekly|Harper's]] and [[Frank Leslie's Weekly|Leslie's]] weeklies in Philadelphia from approximately 1853 to 1860. They settled in [[Washington D.C.]] in 1860, finding residence in the [[Petersen House (Washington, D.C.)|Petersen boarding house]] at 516 Tenth Street, NW, across the street from [[Ford's Theater]], where President [[Abraham Lincoln]] was shot by [[John Wilkes Booth]] on April 14, 1865. It is presumed that Julian Ulke took a famous photo of the Petersen house room in which Lincoln died on the morning of April 15.

[[File:Ugrant.jpeg|thumb|left|Portrait of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], March 2, 1875]]
The brothers had a portrait studio in Washington, D.C. at 1111 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., around the corner from their boarding house. For 40 years, Henry painted portraits of a series of American politicians, scientists and noteworthy individuals - some from his own photos.  Portraits include Earls Elgin and Gray, Sir Frederick Bruce, [[Robert Kennicott]], [[William Stimpson]], [[Edwin M. Stanton]], [[Charles Sumner]], [[James G. Blaine]], Treasury Secretaries [[William H. Crawford|Crawford]], [[Roger B. Taney|Taney]], [[George M. Bibb|Bibb]], [[Salmon P. Chase|Chase]], and [[John G. Carlisle|Carlisle]], Generals Grant, Rawlins, and Blair, as well as [[Samuel D. Ingham]] (1893).

[[Image:MegatheriumClub.jpg|right|thumb|Henry Ulke, upper right - a member of the Megatherium Club, Smithsonian Institution, approximately 1864.]]
Ulke died in Washington, D.C. in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcBBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA401#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=American Art Annual, Volume 8 | publisher=MacMillan Company | year=1911 | pages=401}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[New York Times]]'' obituary says, "Henry Ulke, whose portraits of Presidents and Cabinet Ministers at Washington gained for him the soubriquet of 'Painter of Presidents,' died ... as the result of a fall at his home... He was 89 years old.  Mr. Ulke was a personal friend of Abraham Lincoln, and at the time of the assassination the dying President was carried into the famous Tenth Street house, where he was boarding.  One of Mr. Ulke's best paintings was a portrait of [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]], which now hangs in the long gallery of the White House..."

Henry was a member of the Smithsonian [[Megatherium Club]], and collected beetles.&lt;ref name=SIA/&gt; His beetle collection has been called "one of the largest and most perfect collections of the beetles of North America in existence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Holland |first=W. J. |journal=[[Popular Science Monthly]]|date=May 1901|page=13|volume=59|issue=1|title=The Carnegie Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; He donated his collection to the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History|Carnegie Museum]].&lt;ref name=SIA/&gt; Henry photographed [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Lincoln]] in mourning after [[William Wallace Lincoln|Willie Lincoln's]] death.

==Family==
Henry married Veronica Schultze in 1865.

'''''How Much is Enough?: Money and the Good Life''''' is a 2012 popular [[economics]] book by [[Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky|Robert Skidelsky]] and Edward Skidelsky. It was published initially by [[Other Press]] and later by [[Penguin Books]].

The book asks why Westerners work so many hours per week and lead lives that revolve around money, business and financial decisions in defiance of [[John Maynard Keynes]]' 1930 assertion&lt;ref&gt;[[Yale University]] http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that there would come a time (around 2015) when [[capitalism]] would be able to provide for all our needs and the work week would drop to 10 or even 5 hours.

The book (and Edward Skidelsky's writing generally&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]] https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/23/consumerism-good-life-economic-system&lt;/ref&gt;) looks into the idea of [[Eudaimonia|the good life]] and how capitalism may have been the key to it, but we have now lost sense of the good life as a priority.

The solutions offered to this problem are to "curb insatiability" and to consider a form of [[basic income]] for society.&lt;ref&gt;[[New Escapologist]] http://newescapologist.co.uk/2012/12/06/how-much-is-enough/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

"The over-all thrust of their polemic is a welcome call to reinvigorate society's ethical aspect and bring about the good life for everyone." —''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[The New Yorker]] http://www.newyorker.com/arts/reviews/brieflynoted/2012/08/13/120813crbn_brieflynoted1&lt;/ref&gt;

"How Much Is Enough? is a delightful book. It addresses a Big Question without the jargon and obfuscation that pollutes so much philosophy. The prose is lucid, and all the relevant issues are raised and addressed." —''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Wall Street Journal https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444450004578002083763099910&lt;/ref&gt;

"The authors turn to historical fiction, philosophy, and political theory, drawing on Faust, Marx's critique of capitalism, and Aristotle's uses of wealth. Their conclusion that concepts like respect, friendship, and community are more likely to contribute to satisfaction and overall happiness than wealth makes for a fascinating, if cerebral, read."  —''[[Publishers Weekly]]''&lt;ref&gt;Publishers Weekly http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-59051-507-5&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Skidelskys move seamlessly from the abstract to the concrete; from philosophy to public policy." —''[[The Independent]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Independent https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/book-of-the-week-how-much-is-enough-the-love-of-money-and-the-case-for-the-good-life-by-robert-skidelsky--edward-skidelsky-7917722.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Posner]], in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', disagreed with both the book's concept of leisure and its proposition that more leisure time would lead to overall personal betterment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Posner|first1=Richard|title=Working 9 to 12 ‘How Much Is Enough?’ by Robert Skidelsky and Edward Skidelsky|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/books/review/how-much-is-enough-by-robert-skidelsky-and-edward-skidelsky.html|accessdate=31 July 2015|work=NY Times|date=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[artificial intelligence]], an '''intelligent agent''' ('''IA''') is an [[autonomous]] entity which observes through sensors and acts upon an [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] using actuators (i.e. it is an [[Software agent|agent]]) and directs its activity towards achieving goals (i.e. it is "[[rational choice theory|rational]]", as defined in [[economics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|loc=chpt. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Intelligent agents may also [[machine learning|learn]] or use [[knowledge representation|knowledge]] to achieve their goals. They may be very simple or [[Complexity|very complex]]. A reflex machine, such as a [[thermostat]], is considered an example of an intelligent agent.&lt;ref&gt;According to the definition given by {{harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|loc=chpt. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IntelligentAgent-SimpleReflex.png|thumb|right|408px|Simple reflex agent]]
Intelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a [[computer program]]. For this reason, intelligent agents are sometimes called '''abstract intelligent agents''' ('''AIA'''){{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} to distinguish them from their real world implementations as computer systems, biological systems, or organizations. Some definitions of intelligent agents emphasize their [[Wiktionary:Autonomy|autonomy]], and so prefer the term '''autonomous intelligent agents'''. Still others (notably {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003}}) considered goal-directed behavior as the essence of intelligence and so prefer a term borrowed from [[economics]], "[[rational agent]]".

Intelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related to [[agent (economics)|agent]]s in [[Agent-based computational economics|economics]], and versions of the intelligent agent paradigm are studied in [[cognitive science]], [[ethic]]s, the philosophy of [[practical reason]], as well as in many [[interdisciplinary]] [[socio-cognitive]] [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] and computer [[social simulation]]s.

Intelligent agents are also closely related to [[software agent]]s (an autonomous computer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users). In [[computer science]], the term ''intelligent agent'' may be used to refer to a software agent that has some intelligence, regardless if it is not a rational agent by Russell and Norvig's definition. For example, autonomous programs used for operator assistance or [[data mining]] (sometimes referred to as ''[[bot (disambiguation)|bots]]'') are also called "intelligent agents".

==A variety of definitions==
&lt;!-- Ideally, this should be an accurate survey of all the definitions in use. This requires the editor to have an accurate understanding of which definitions are mainstream and which are obscure. Thus the expert tag. ---&gt;
Intelligent agents have been defined many different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Some definitions are examined by {{Harvnb|Franklin|Graesser|1996}} and {{Harvnb|Kasabov|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nikola Kasabov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kasabov|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; AI systems should exhibit the following characteristics:
* Accommodate new [[problem solving]] rules incrementally
* Adapt [[online]] and in [[Real-time computing|real time]]
* Are able to analyze [[self-concept|themselves]] in terms of behavior, error and success.
* Learn and improve through interaction with the environment ([[embodied agent|embodiment]])
* Learn quickly from large amounts of [[data (computing)|data]]
* Have memory-based exemplar [[computer storage|storage]] and retrieval capacities
* Have [[parameter (computer science)|parameters]] to represent short and long term memory, age, forgetting, etc.

==Structure of agents==
A simple agent program can be defined mathematically as an [[agent function]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; which maps every possible percepts sequence to a possible action the agent can perform or to a coefficient, feedback element, function or constant that affects eventual actions:
:&lt;math&gt;f : P^\ast \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;
Agent function is an abstract concept as it could incorporate various principles of decision making like calculation of [[utility]] of individual options, deduction over logic rules, [[fuzzy logic]], etc.&lt;ref name="Salamon2011"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Salamon | first1 = Tomas | title = Design of Agent-Based Models | location = Repin | publisher = Bruckner Publishing | year= 2011 | pages = 42–59 | isbn = 978-80-904661-1-1 | url=http://www.designofagentbasedmodels.info/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[program agent]], instead, maps every possible percept to an action{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}.

We use the term percept to refer to the agent's perceptional inputs at any given instant. In the following figures an agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.

==Architectures==
{{Harvtxt|Weiss|2013}} defines four classes of agents:
*Logic-based agents – in which the decision about what action to perform is made via logical deduction;
*Reactive agents – in which decision making is implemented in some form of direct mapping from situation to action;
*Belief-desire-intention agents – in which decision making depends upon the manipulation of data structures representing the beliefs, desires, and intentions of the agent; and finally,
*Layered architectures – in which decision making is realized via various software layers, each of which is more or less explicitly reasoning about the environment at different levels of abstraction.

Generally, an agent can be constructed by separating the body into the sensors and actuators and that operates with a complex perception system that takes the description of the world as input for a controller and outputs commands to the actuator. However, a hierarchy of controller layers if often necessary to balance the immediate reaction desired for low-level tasks and the slow reasoning about complex, high-level goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Poole|first1=David|last2=Mackworth|first2=Alan|title=1.3 Agents Situated in Environments‣ Chapter 2 Agent Architectures and Hierarchical Control‣ Artificial Intelligence: Foundations of Computational Agents, 2nd Edition|url=https://artint.info/2e/html/ArtInt2e.Ch2.S3.html|website=artint.info|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classes==

[[Image:IntelligentAgent-Learning.png|thumb|right|408px|A general learning agent]]

{{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003}} group agents into five classes based on their degree of perceived intelligence and capability:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=46–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# simple reflex agents
# model-based reflex agents
# goal-based agents
# utility-based agents
# learning agents

===Simple reflex agents===
Simple reflex agents act only on the basis of the current percept, ignoring the rest of the percept history. The agent function is based on the ''condition-action rule'': if condition then action.

This agent function only succeeds when the environment is fully observable. Some reflex agents can also contain information on their current state which allows them to disregard conditions whose actuators are already triggered.

Infinite loops are often unavoidable for simple reflex agents operating in partially observable environments. Note: If the agent can randomize its actions, it may be possible to escape from infinite loops.

===Model-based reflex agents===
A '''model-based agent can handle partially observable environments. Its current state is stored inside the agent maintaining some kind of structure which describes the part of the world which cannot''' be seen. This knowledge about "how the world works" is called a model of the world, hence the name "model-based agent".

A model-based reflex agent should maintain some sort of [[Mental model|internal model]] that depends on the percept history and thereby reflects at least some of the unobserved aspects of the current state. Percept history and impact of action on the environment can be determined by using internal model. It then chooses an action in the same way as reflex agent.

An agent may also use models to describe and predict the behaviors of other agents in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;S.V. Albrecht and P. Stone (2018). Autonomous Agents Modelling Other Agents: A Comprehensive Survey and Open Problems.
Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 258, pp. 66-95. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2018.01.002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goal-based agents===
Goal-based agents further expand on the capabilities of the model-based agents, by using "goal" information. Goal information describes situations that are desirable. This allows the agent a way to choose among multiple possibilities, selecting the one which reaches a goal state. Search and [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] are the subfields of artificial intelligence devoted to finding action sequences that achieve the agent's goals.

===Utility-based agents===
Goal-based agents only distinguish between goal states and non-goal states. It is possible to define a measure of how desirable a particular state is. This measure can be obtained through the use of a ''utility function'' which maps a state to a measure of the utility of the state. A more general performance measure should allow a [[comparison (computer programming)|comparison]] of different world states according to exactly how happy they would make the agent. The term utility can be used to describe how "happy" the agent is.

A rational utility-based agent chooses the action that maximizes the expected utility of the action outcomes - that is, what the agent expects to derive, on average, given the probabilities and utilities of each outcome. A utility-based agent has to model and keep track of its environment, tasks that have involved a great deal of research on perception, representation, reasoning, and learning.

===Learning agents===
Learning has the advantage that it allows the agents to initially operate in unknown environments and to become more competent than its initial knowledge alone might allow. The most important distinction is between the "learning element", which is responsible for making improvements, and the "performance element", which is responsible for selecting external actions.

The learning element uses feedback from the "critic" on how the agent is doing and determines how the performance element should be modified to do better in the future.
The performance element is what we have previously considered to be the entire agent: it takes in percepts and decides on actions.

The last component of the learning agent is the "problem generator". It is responsible for suggesting actions that will lead to new and informative experiences.

==Hierarchies of agents==
{{Main|Multi-agent system}}

To actively perform their [[function (engineering)|functions]], Intelligent Agents today are normally gathered in a hierarchical structure containing many “sub-agents”. Intelligent sub-agents process and perform lower level functions. Taken together, the intelligent agent and sub-agents create a complete system that can accomplish difficult tasks or goals with behaviors and responses that display a form of intelligence.

== Applications==

Intelligent agents are applied as [[automated online assistant]]s, where they function to perceive the needs of customers in order to perform individualized [[customer service]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59512">'''Interplanetary contamination''' refers to [[biological contamination]] of a [[planetary body]] by a [[space probe]] or [[spacecraft]], either deliberate or unintentional.

There are two types of interplanetary contamination:
*'''''Forward contamination''''' is the transfer of life and other forms of contamination from Earth to another celestial body. 
*'''''Back contamination''''' is the introduction of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] organisms and other forms of contamination into [[Earth]]'s [[biosphere]]. It also covers infection of humans and human habitats in space and on other celestial bodies by extraterrestrial organisms, if such habitats exist.

The main focus is on [[microbial life]] and on potentially [[invasive species]]. Non-biological forms of contamination have also been considered, including contamination of sensitive deposits (such as lunar polar ice deposits) of scientific interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=S.T. Shipley , P.T. Metzger  and J.E. Lane|title=Lunar Cold Trap Contamination by Landing Vehicles| url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140017853.pdf|website=Earth and Space 2014 - Proceedings of the 14th Biennial ASCE Conference on Engineering, Science, Construction, and Operations in Challenging Environments}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of back contamination, multicellular life is thought unlikely but has not been ruled out. In the case of forward contamination, contamination by multicellular life (e.g. lichens) is unlikely to occur for robotic missions, but it becomes a consideration in [[Human mission to Mars|crewed missions to Mars]].&lt;ref name="PHYS-20180227"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff - [[Purdue University]] |title=Tesla in space could carry bacteria from Earth |url=https://phys.org/news/2018-02-tesla-space-bacteria-earth.html |date=27 February 2018 |work=[[phys.org]] |accessdate=28 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current space missions are governed by the [[Outer Space Treaty]] and the [[COSPAR]] guidelines for [[planetary protection]]. Forward contamination is prevented primarily by sterilizing the spacecraft. In the case of [[sample-return mission]]s (back contamination) the aim of the mission is to return extraterrestrial samples to Earth, and sterilization of the samples would make them of much less interest. So, back contamination would be prevented mainly by containment, and breaking the chain of contact between the planet of origin and Earth. It would also require [[quarantine]] procedures for the materials and for anyone who comes into contact with them.

==Overview ==

Most of the [[Solar System]] appears hostile to life as we know it. No extraterrestrial life has ever been discovered, but there are several locations outside Earth where microbial life could possibly exist, have existed, or thrive if introduced. If extraterrestrial life exists, it may be vulnerable to interplanetary contamination by foreign microorganisms. Some [[extremophile]]s may be able to survive space travel to another planet, and foreign life could possibly be introduced by spacecraft from Earth and transform the location from its current pristine state. This poses scientific and ethical concerns.

Locations within the Solar System where life might exist today include the oceans of liquid water beneath the icy surface of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and [[Enceladus]], and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] (its surface has oceans of liquid [[ethane]] / [[methane]], but it may also have liquid water below the surface and [[cryovolcano|ice volcanoes]]).&lt;ref name=smallsolarsystembodies&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~spi/COSPAR_OP_PP_Workshop_final_Aug2009.pdf COSPAR Workshop on Planetary Protection for Outer Planet Satellites and Small Solar System Bodies] European Space Policy Institute (ESPI), 15–17 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2011/06/29/Rummel_COSPAR_COPUOS_PPS_9May11_-_TAGGED.pdf COSPAR power point type presentation, gives good overview of the detailed category decisions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019160210/http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2011/06/29/Rummel_COSPAR_COPUOS_PPS_9May11_-_TAGGED.pdf |date=2013-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple consequences for both forward- and back-contamination. If a planet becomes contaminated with Earth life, it might then be difficult to tell whether any lifeforms discovered originated there or came from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/read/if-there-are-microbes-on-mars-we-could-have-put-them-there If there Are Microbes on Mars, We Might Have Put Them There]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the organic chemicals produced by the introduced life would confuse sensitive searches for [[biosignature]]s of living or ancient native life. The same applies to other more complex biosignatures. Life on other planets could have a common origin with Earth life, since in the early Solar System there was much exchange of material between the planets which could have transferred life as well. If so, it might be based on [[nucleic acid]]s too ([[RNA]] or [[DNA]]). 

This is true of species detected in spacecraft [[cleanroom]]s. The majority of the species isolated are not well understood or characterized and cannot be cultured in labs, and are known only from DNA fragments obtained with swabs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v2/n1/full/ismej200798a.html Archaeal diversity analysis of spacecraft assembly clean rooms], he ISME Journal (2008) 2, 115–119; {{DOI|10.1038/ismej.2007.98}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a contaminated planet, it might be difficult to distinguish the [[DNA]] of extraterrestrial life from the DNA of life brought to the planet by the exploring. Most species of microorganism on Earth are not yet well understood or DNA sequenced. This particularly applies to the unculturable [[archaea]], and so are difficult to study. This can be either because they depend on the presence of other microorganisms, or are slow growing, or depend on other conditions not yet understood. In [[Agar plate|typical habitats]], 99% of microorganisms are not [[Microbiological culture|culturable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12004133 | doi=10.1126/science.1070633 | volume=296 | title=Isolating "uncultivable" microorganisms in pure culture in a simulated natural environment | journal=Science | pages=1127–9 | last1 = Kaeberlein | first1 = T | last2 = Lewis | first2 = K | last3 = Epstein | first3 = SS|bibcode = 2002Sci...296.1127K }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Introduced Earth life could contaminate resources of value for future human missions, such as water.&lt;ref name=groundwatercontamination&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-27526981 Queens University Belfast scientist helps NASA Mars project] "No-one has yet proved that there is deep groundwater on Mars, but it is plausible as there is certainly surface ice and atmospheric water vapour, so we wouldn't want to contaminate it and make it unusable by the introduction of micro-organisms."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Invasive species]] could outcompete native life or consume it, if there is life on the planet.&lt;ref name=martianrabbit&gt;Rachel Courtland [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16546-should-mars-be-treated-like-a-wildlife-preserve.html#.UgZ6qpJMu84 Should Mars be treated like a wildlife preserve?] New Scientist, February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; One argument against this is that the native life would be more adapted to the conditions there. However, the experience on Earth shows that species moved from one continent to another may be able to outcompete the native life adapted to that continent.&lt;ref name=martianrabbit /&gt; Additionally, evolutionary processes on Earth might have developed biological pathways different from extraterrestrial organisms, and so may be able to out-compete it. The same is also possible the other way around for back contamination introduced to Earth's [[biosphere]].

In addition of science concerns, [[Ethics|ethical]] or moral issues have also been raised on accidental and intentional interplanetary transport of life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/ast.2012.0891 Ethical Considerations for Planetary Protection

== Evidence for possible habitats outside Earth ==

[[Enceladus]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] show the best evidence for current habitats, mainly due to the possibility of their hosting liquid water and organic compounds.

There is ample evidence to suggest that Mars once offered habitable conditions for microbial life.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131209"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=On Mars, an Ancient Lake and Perhaps Life |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/science/space/on-mars-an-ancient-lake-and-perhaps-life.html |date=December 9, 2013 |work=[[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20131209"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Various |title=Science - Special Collection - Curiosity Rover on Mars |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/extra/curiosity/ |date=December 9, 2013 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore possible that microbial life may have existed on Mars, although no evidence has been found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1002/2014GL060302/ Experimental evidence for the formation of liquid saline water on Mars ], Erik Fischer, Germán M.

However, since a great variety of microbes tolerate this type of radiation at similar or even greater doses than those found on Mars, ionizing radiation cannot be considered a limiting factor for microbial life on Mars and thus here we will limit our study to solar UV shielding and VIS radiation pentration."&lt;/ref&gt;

These samples also were subjected to a simulated Martian atmosphere using EuTEF. Most of the organisms exposed to solar UV radiation in space and in the Mars spectrum were killed, but when UV rays were filtered out and samples were kept in the dark, about 50 percent or more of those subjected to other space- and Mars-like conditions survived. That makes it likely that spores could survive a trip on a spacecraft to Mars if they are sheltered against solar radiation, perhaps in a tiny pocket of the spacecraft surface or underneath a layer of other spores."&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, Mars may have already been interplanetarily contaminated.

Other studies have suggested the potential for life to survive using [[Hygroscopy#Deliquescence|deliquescing salts]]. These, similarly to the lichens, use the humidity of the atmosphere. If the mixture of salts is right, the organisms may obtain liquid water at times of high atmospheric humidity, with salts capture enough to be capable of supporting life.

Research published in July 2017 shows that when irradiated with a simulated Martian UV flux, [[perchlorate]]s become even more lethal to bacteria ([[bactericide]] effect).

=== Enceladus ===

The [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'' spacecraft]] [[Cassini-Huygens#Enceladus flybys|directly sampled]] the plumes escaping from Enceladus. Measured data indicates that these geysers are made primarily of salt rich particles with an 'ocean-like' composition, which is thought to originate from a [[Ocean#Extraterrestrial oceans|subsurface ocean]] of liquid saltwater, rather than from the moon's icy surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Cassini-Huygens/Cassini_samples_the_icy_spray_of_Enceladus_water_plumes Cassini samples the icy spray of Enceladus' water plumes]; June 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the geyser flythroughs also indicate the presence of organic chemicals in the plumes. Heat scans of Enceladus' surface also indicate warmer temperatures around the fissures where the geysers originate from, with temperatures reaching -93&amp;nbsp;°C (-135&amp;nbsp;°F), which is 115&amp;nbsp;°C (207&amp;nbsp;°F) warmer than the surrounding surface regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20080326.html Cassini Tastes Organic Material at Saturn's Geyser Moon]; March 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europa ===

Europa has much indirect evidence for its sub-surface ocean. Models of how Europa is affected by [[tidal heating]] require a subsurface layer of liquid water in order to accurately reproduce the linear fracturing of the surface. Indeed, observations by the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' spacecraft]] of how Europa's magnetic field interacts with Jupiter's field strengthens the case for a liquid, rather than solid, layer; an [[Dynamo theory|electrically conductive fluid]] deep within Europa would explain these results.&lt;ref&gt;[https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/europa/evidence.cfm What Makes Us Think There is an Ocean Beneath Europa's Icy Crust?], Paragraphs 4 - 7&lt;/ref&gt; Observations from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] in December 2012 appear to show an ice plume spouting from Europa's surface,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129502.700-water-plumes-spark-a-race-to-jupiter-moon-europa.html#.VAYIo_ldWSo Water plumes spark a race to Jupiter moon Europa], Lisa Grossman, New Scientist 31 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; which would immensely strengthen the case for a liquid subsurface ocean. As was the case for Enceladus, vapour geysers would allow for easy sampling of the liquid layer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/hubble-europa-water-vapor Hubble Space Telescope Sees Evidence of Water Vapor Venting off Jupiter Moon], Paragraph 4; December 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there appears to be little evidence that geysering is a frequent event on Europa due to the lack of water in the space near Europa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/signs-of-europa-plumes-remain-elusive-in-search-of-cassini-data Signs of Europa Plumes Remain Elusive in Search of Cassini Data]; December 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planetary protection==
{{main|Planetary protection}}

Forward contamination is prevented by [[Sterilization (microbiology)#Spacecraft|sterilizing space probes]] sent to sensitive areas of the Solar System. Missions are classified depending on whether their destinations are of interest for the search for life, and whether there is any chance that Earth life could reproduce there.

NASA made these policies official with the issuing of Management Manual NMI-4-4-1, ''NASA Unmanned Spacecraft Decontamination Policy'' on September 9, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meltzer|first1=Michael|title=When Biospheres Collide: A History of NASA's Planetary Protection Programs|date=May 31, 2012|isbn=978-0-16-085327-2|pages=46–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to NMI-4-4-1 the same sterilization requirements were required on all outgoing spacecraft regardless of their target.  Difficulties in the sterilization of Ranger probes sent to the Moon are the primary reasons for NASA's change to a target-by-target basis in assessing the likelihood forward contamination.
 
Some destinations such as [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] need no precautions at all. Others such as the Moon require documentation but nothing more, while destinations such as Mars require sterilization of the rovers sent there. For the details, see [[Planetary protection]].

Back contamination would be prevented by containment or quarantine. However, there have been no sample-returns thought to have any possibility of a back contamination risk since the [[Apollo program|Apollo missions]]. The Apollo regulations have been rescinded and new regulations have yet to be developed, see [[#Precautions suggested for sample-return|Precautions suggested for sample-return]]

== Crewed spacecraft ==

[[Human spaceflight|Crewed spacecraft]] are of particular concern for interplanetary contamination because of the impossibility to sterilize a human to the same level as a robotic spacecraft. Therefore, the chance of forward contamination is higher than for a robotic mission.&lt;ref name=biospherescollide /&gt; Humans are typically [[Host (biology)|host]] to a hundred trillion microorganisms in ten thousand species in the [[human microbiome]] which cannot be removed while preserving the life of the human. Containment seems the only option, but effective containment to the same standard as a robotic rover appears difficult to achieve with present-day technology. In particular, adequate containment in the event of a hard landing is a major challenge.

Human explorers may be potential carriers back to Earth of microorganisms acquired on Mars, if such microorganisms exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10360&amp;page=37 Safe on Mars page 37] "Martian biological contamination may occur if astronauts breathe contaminated dust or if they contact material that is introduced into their habitat. If an astronaut becomes contaminated or infected, it is conceivable that he or she could transmit Martian biological entities or even disease to fellow astronauts, or introduce such entities into the biosphere upon returning to Earth. A contaminated vehicle or item of equipment returned to Earth could also be a source of contamination."&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is the contamination of the water supply by Earth microorganisms shed by humans in their stools, skin and breath, which could have a direct effect on the long-term human colonization of Mars.&lt;ref name=groundwatercontamination /&gt;

==The Moon as a testbed ==

The [[Moon]] has been suggested as a testbed for new technology to protect sites in the Solar System, and astronauts, from forward and back contamination. Currently, the Moon has no contamination restrictions because it is considered to be "not of interest" for prebiotic chemistry and [[abiogenesis|origins of life]].  Analysis of the contamination left by the [[Apollo program]] astronauts could also yield useful ground truth for planetary protection models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/file_download/53/Conley_Rummel_Acta_Astro_PP_Mars_Moon.pdf Mars and the Moon (C.

== Non-contaminating exploration methods ==
[[File:Teleroboitcs image2.jpg|thumb|Telerobotics exploration on Mars and Earth]]

One of the most reliable ways to reduce the risk of forward and back contamination during visits to extraterrestrial bodies is to use only [[Robotic spacecraft]].&lt;ref name=biospherescollide&gt; [http://www.nasa.gov/connect/ebooks/when_biospheres_collide_detail.html#.U_uVh_mwJcQ When Biospheres Collide - a history of NASA'S Planetary Protection Programs], Michael Meltzer, May 31, 2012. See Chapter 7, Return to Mars. Quote: "One of the most reliable ways to reduce the risk of forward contamination during visits to extraterrestrial bodies is to make those visits only with robotic spacecraft. Sending a person to Mars would be, for some observers, more exciting. But in the view of much of the space science community, robotic missions are the way to accomplish the maximum amount of scientific inquiry since valuable fuel and shipboard power do not have to be expended in transporting and operating the equipment to keep a human crew alive and healthy. And very important to planetary protection goals, robotic craft can be thoroughly sterilized, while humans cannot. Such a difference can be critical in protecting sensitive targets, such as the special regions of Mars, from forward contamination." "Perhaps a change in the public's perspective as to just what today's robotic missions really are would be helpful in deciding what types of missions are important to implement. In the opinion of Terence Johnson, who has played a major role in many of NASA's robotic missions, including serving as the project scientist for the Galileo mission and the planned Europa Orbiter mission, the term "robotic exploration" misses the point. NASA is actually conducting human exploration on these projects.  The mission crews that sit in the control panel at JPL, "as well as everyone else who can log on to the Internet" can observe in near real-time what is going on. The spacecraft instruments, in other words, are becoming more like collective sense organs for humankind. Thus, according to Johnson, when NASA conducts its so-called robotic missions, people all around the world are really "all standing on the bridge of Starship Enterprise". The question must thus be asked, when, if ever, is it necessary for the good of humankind to send people rather than increasingly sophisticated robots to explore other worlds." &lt;/ref&gt; Humans in close orbit around the target planet could control equipment on the surface in real time via telepresence, so bringing many of the benefits of a surface mission, without its associated increased forward and back contamination risks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/category/wiredscience?p=136729 Almost Being There: Why the Future of Space Exploration Is Not What You Think]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://telerobotics.gsfc.nasa.gov/  First Exploration Telereobotics Symposium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705060719/http://telerobotics.gsfc.nasa.gov/ |date=2015-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[HERRO: A Science-Oriented Strategy for Crewed Missions Beyond LEO HERRO: A Science-Oriented Strategy for Crewed Missions Beyond LEO]
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Back contamination issues ==

Since the Moon is now generally considered to be free from life, the most likely source of contamination would be from Mars during either a [[Mars sample-return mission]] or as a result of a [[Human mission to Mars|crewed mission to Mars]]. The possibility of new human pathogens, or environmental disruption due to back contamination, is considered to be of extremely low probability but cannot yet be ruled out.

There are no immediate plans for a Mars sample-return, but it remains a high priority for NASA and the ESA because of its great potential biological and geological interest. The European Space Foundation report cites many advantages of a Mars sample-return. In particular, it would permit extensive analyses on Earth, without the size and weight constraints for instruments sent to Mars on rovers. These analyses could also be carried out without the communication delays for experiments carried out by Martian rovers. It would also make it possible to repeat experiments in multiple laboratories with different instruments to confirm key results.&lt;ref name=esf2012_PP-advanntages&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/17/ESF_Mars_Sample_Return_backward_contamination_study.pdf European Science Foundation - Mars Sample Return backward contamination - strategic advice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602150139/http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/17/ESF_Mars_Sample_Return_backward_contamination_study.pdf |date=2016-06-02 }} July, 2012, {{ISBN|978-2-918428-67-1}} - see 2. From remote exploration to returning samples. (for more details of the document see [http://elib.dlr.de/78092/ abstract] )&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Sagan]] was first to publicise back contamination issues that might follow from a Mars sample-return. In ''Cosmic Connection'' (1973) he wrote:
{{bq|Precisely because Mars is an environment of great potential biological interest, it is possible that on Mars there are pathogens, organisms which, if transported to the terrestrial environment, might do enormous biological damage.&lt;ref name=cosmicconnection&gt;Carl Sagan,[http://www.e-reading.org.ua/bookreader.php/148581/Sagan_-_The_Cosmic_Connection___An_Extraterrestrial_Perspective.pdf ''The Cosmic Connection - an Extraterrestrial Perspective''] (1973) {{ISBN|0521783038}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Later in ''Cosmos'' (1980) Carl Sagan wrote:
{{bq|Perhaps Martian samples can be safely returned to Earth. But I would want to be very sure before considering a returned-sample mission.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Sagan [https://books.google.com/books/about/Cosmos.html Cosmos] Random House Publishing Group, 6 Jul 2011&lt;/ref&gt;}}

NASA and ESA views are similar. The findings were that with present-day technology, Martian samples can be safely returned to Earth provided the right precautions are taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Assessment of Planetary Protection Requirements for Mars Sample Return Missions |publisher=National Research Council |year=2009|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12576&amp;page=46}}| Quote: "The risks of [[Environmental degradation|environmental disruption]] resulting from the inadvertent contamination of Earth with putative martian microbes are still considered to be low. But since the risk cannot be demonstrated to be zero, due care and caution must be exercised in handling any martian materials returned to Earth."
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suggested precautions for sample-returns ===

NASA has already had experience with returning samples thought to represent a low back contamination risk when samples were returned for the first time by [[Apollo 11]]. At the time, it was thought that there was a low probability of life on the Moon, so the requirements were not very stringent. The precautions taken then were inadequate by current standards, however. The regulations used then have been rescinded, and new regulations and approaches for a sample-return would be needed.&lt;ref name=race&gt;M. S.

==== Receiving facility ====

[[File:NIAID Integrated Research Facility - Positive Pressure Personnel Suit.jpg|thumb|Working inside a BSL-4 laboratory with air hoses providing positive air pressure to their suits]]

To receive, analyze and curate extraterrestrial soil samples, NASA has proposed to build a biohazard containment facility, tentatively known as the Mars Sample Return Receiving Facility (MSRRF).&lt;ref name=samplereceivingfacility&gt; [http://www.lpi.usra.edu/pss/presentations/200803/04-Atlas-PPSonMSR.pdf Mars Sample Return Receiving Facility].

The facility's systems must be able to contain unknown biohazards, as the sizes of any putative Martian microorganisms are unknown. In consideration of this, additional requirements were proposed. Ideally it should filter particles of 0.01&amp;nbsp;µm or larger, and release of a particle 0.05&amp;nbsp;µm or larger is unacceptable under any circumstance.&lt;ref name='GTA 2013'&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/17/ESF_Mars_Sample_Return_backward_contamination_study.pdf European Science Foundation - Mars Sample Return backward contamination - Strategic advice and requirements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602150139/http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/17/ESF_Mars_Sample_Return_backward_contamination_study.pdf |date=2016-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The reason for this extremely small size limit of 0.01&amp;nbsp;µm is for consideration of [[gene transfer agent]]s (GTAs) which are virus-like particles that are produced by some microorganisms that package random segments of [[DNA]] capable of [[horizontal gene transfer]].&lt;ref name='GTA 2013'/&gt; These randomly incorporate segments of the host genome and can transfer them to other evolutionarily distant hosts, and do that without killing the new host. In this way many archaea and bacteria can swap DNA with each other. This raises the possibility that Martian life, if it has a common origin with Earth life in the distant past, could swap DNA with Earth microorganisms in the same way.&lt;ref name='GTA 2013'/&gt; In one experiment reported in 2010, researchers left GTAs (DNA conferring antibiotic resistance) and marine bacteria overnight in natural conditions and found that by the next day up to 47% of the bacteria had incorporated the genetic material from the GTAs.&lt;ref name=naturegta&gt;Amy Maxmen [http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100930/full/news.2010.507.html Virus-like particles speed bacterial evolution] published online 30 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lauren D. McDaniel, Elizabeth Young, Jennifer Delaney, Fabian Ruhnau, Kim B. Ritchie, John H. Paul [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6000/50 High Frequency of Horizontal Gene Transfer in the Oceans] Science 1 October 2010: Vol. 330 no. 6000 p. 50 {{DOI|10.1126/science.1192243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the 0.05&amp;nbsp;µm limit is because of the discovery of [[ultramicrobacteria]] as small as 0.2&amp;nbsp;µm across.&lt;ref name='GTA 2013'/&gt;

The BSL-4 containment facility must also double as a [[cleanroom]] to preserve the science value of the samples. A challenge is that, while it is relatively easy to simply contain the samples once returned to Earth, researchers would also want to remove parts of the sample and perform analyses. During all these handling procedures, the samples would need to be protected from Earthly contamination. A [[cleanroom]] is normally kept at a higher pressure than the external environment to keep contaminants out, while a biohazard laboratory is kept at a lower pressure to keep the biohazards in. This would require to compartmentalize the specialized rooms in order to combine these in a single building. Solutions suggested include a triple walled containment facility, and one of the suggestions include extensive robotic handling of the samples.&lt;ref name=MSRRF-clean-room-quote&gt;{{cite report |title=Mars Sample Return Receiving Facility - A Draft Test Protocol for Detecting Possible Biohazards in Martian Samples Returned to Earth |year=2002 |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/pss/presentations/200803/04-Atlas-PPSonMSR.pdf| quote=''A Sample Return Facility will require combining technologies used for constructing maximum containment laboratories (e.g. Biosafety Level 4 labs) with cleanroom technologies which will be needed to protect the Mars samples from Earth contamination.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marsinstitute.info/epo/docs/draft_protocol.pdf A Draft Test Protocol for Detecting Possible Biohazards in Martian Samples Returned to Earth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222131531/http://www.marsinstitute.info/epo/docs/draft_protocol.pdf |date=2006-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/1395.pdf CLEANROOM ROBOTICS – APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY FOR A SAMPLE RECEIVING  FACILITY 2005 update on the Draft Test Protocol ].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/reports/13117/App%20G%2008_Mars-Sample-Return-Orbiter.pdf 2010 Mars Sample Return Orbiter decadal survey]: Quote: The NASA Planetary Protection Officer commissioned the development of a draft test protocol that would represent one "necessary and sufficient" approach to evaluate the safety of the samples while safeguarding the purity of the samples from terrestrial contamination. A Draft Test Protocol for Detecting Possible Biohazards in Martian Samples Returned to Earth was published in October 2002 [7]. In 2003, three architectural design teams independently examined the scope, approach, cost, and technology required for the SRF, using the Draft Test Protocol for requirements. The approaches varied from allrobotic handling of samples to more traditional glove box implementations. The studies indicated that the principles and techniques required are generally mature. Biosafety laboratories, the NASA Lunar Sample Facility, pharmaceutical laboratories, and electronic fabrication cleanrooms perform most of the required individual functions. However, there are some areas needing early development, such as ensuring sample preservation and bio-safety together, representing new challenges that were addressed by techniques like dual-walled containers (and gloves) with positive pressure clean inert gas in between the walls. This, as well as some further development in ultra-clean sample manipulation, safe and pure transport of samples, and sample sterilization techniques, are planned in the technology program.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility would be expected to take 7 to 10 years from design to completion,&lt;ref name='Assessment 2009'&gt;{{cite report |title=Assessment of Planetary Protection Requirements for Mars Sample Return Missions |publisher=National Research Council |year=2009 |chapter=7: "Sample-Receiving Facility and Program Oversight" |page=59 |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12576&amp;page=59 |quote=''It has been estimated that the planning, design, site selection, environmental reviews, approvals, construction, commissioning, and pre-testing of a proposed safe room facility (SRF) will occur 7 to 10 years before actual operations begin.

==== Dissenting views on back contamination ====

Robert Zubrin, from the [[Mars Society]], maintains that the risk of back contamination is negligible. He supports this using an argument based on the possibility of transfer of life from Earth to Mars on meteorites.&lt;ref name=zubrin&gt;Robert Zubrin "Contamination From Mars: No Threat", [http://www.planetary.org/explore/the-planetary-report/ The Planetary Report] July/Aug. 2000, P.4–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- I haven't yet been able to obtain this article --&gt;&lt;!-- he says it in this later interview as well however, which is available online--&gt;&lt;ref name=zubrin-interview&gt;[http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/cwc/Teaching/SpaceCol/sts497i/Zubrin/transcript.txt transcription of a tele-conference interview with ROBERT ZUBRIN] conducted on March 30, 2001 by the class members of STS497 I, "Space Colonization"; Instructor: Dr. Chris Churchill&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legal process of approval for Mars sample-return ====

Margaret Race has examined in detail the legal process of approval for a MSR.&lt;ref name="race"/&gt; She found that under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (which did not exist in the Apollo era) a formal environment impact statement is likely to be required, and public hearings during which all the issues would be aired openly. This process is likely to take up to several years to complete.

During this process, she found, the full range of worst accident scenarios, impact, and project alternatives would be played out in the public arena. Other agencies such as the Environment Protection Agency, Occupational Health and Safety Administration, etc., may also get involved in the decision making process.

The laws on quarantine will also need to be clarified as the regulations for the Apollo program were rescinded. In the Apollo era, NASA delayed announcement of its quarantine regulations until the day Apollo was launched, so bypassing the requirement for public debate - something that would be unlikely to be tolerated today.

It is also probable that the presidential directive NSC-25 will apply which requires a review of large scale alleged effects on the environment and is carried out subsequent to the other domestic reviews and through a long process, leads eventually to presidential approval of the launch.

Then apart from those domestic legal hurdles, there are numerous international regulations and treaties to be negotiated in the case of a Mars sample-return, especially those relating to environmental protection and health. She concluded that the public of necessity has a significant role to play in the development of the policies governing Mars sample-return.

=== Alternatives to sample-returns ===

Several exobiologists have suggested that a Mars sample-return is not necessary at this stage, and that it is better to focus more on in situ studies on the surface first. Although it is not their main motivation, this approach of course also eliminates back contamination risks.

Some of these exobiologists advocate more in situ studies followed by a sample-return in the near future. Others go as far as to advocate in situ study instead of a sample-return at the present state of understanding of Mars.&lt;ref name=JeffreyBada&gt;Jeffrey L. Bada, Andrew D. Aubrey, Frank J. Grunthaner, Michael Hecht, Richard Quinn, Richard Mathies, Aaron Zent, John H. Chalmers [https://archive.org/details/JeffreyLBada Seeking signs of life on mars: in situ investigations as prerequisites to sample return missions] Independent Contribution to the Mars Decadal Survey Panel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paige&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/robomars/pdf/6199.pdf Mars Exploration Strategies: Forget About Sample Return] D. A. Paige, Dept. of Earth and Space Sciences, UCLA,
Los Angeles, CA 90095&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/18322-mars-sample-return-humans-robots.html Future Mars Missions: Can Humans Trump Robots?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their reasoning is that life on Mars is likely to be hard to find. Any present day life is likely to be sparse and occur in only a few niche habitats. Past life is likely to be degraded by cosmic radiation over geological time periods if exposed in the top few meters of the Mars surface. Also, only certain special deposits of salts or clays on Mars would have the capability to preserve organics for billions of years. So, they argue, there is a high risk that a Mars sample-return at our current stage of understanding would return samples that are no more conclusive about the origins of life on Mars or present day life than the Martian meteorite samples we already have.

Another consideration is the difficulty of keeping the sample completely free from Earth life contamination during the return journey and during handling procedures on Earth. This might make it hard to show conclusively that any biosignatures detected does not result from contamination of the samples.

Instead they advocate sending more sensitive instruments on Mars surface rovers. These could examine many different rocks and soil types, and search for biosignatures on the surface and so examine a wide range of materials which could not all be returned to Earth with current technology at reasonable cost.

A sample-return to Earth would then be considered at a later stage, once we have a reasonably thorough understanding of conditions on Mars, and possibly have already detected life there, either current or past life, through biosignatures and other ''in situ'' analyses.

==== Study and analyses from orbit ====

During the “Exploration	Telerobotics	Symposium" in 2012 experts on telerobotics from industry, NASA and academics met to discuss telerobotics, and its applications to space exploration. Amongst other issues, particular attention was given to Mars missions and a Mars sample-return.

They came to the conclusion that telerobotic approaches could permit direct study of the samples on the Mars surface via telepresence from Mars orbit, permitting rapid exploration and use of human cognition to take advantage of chance discoveries and feedback from the results obtained so far.&lt;ref name="lpi.usra.edu"&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/marsconcepts2012/pdf/4214.pdf LOW-LATENCY TELEROBOTICS FROM MARS ORBIT: THE CASE FOR SYNERGY BETWEEN SCIENCE AND HUMAN EXPLORATION], Concepts and Approaches for Mars Exploration (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

They found that telepresence exploration of Mars has many advantages. The astronauts have near real-time control of the robots, and can respond immediately to discoveries. It also prevents contamination both ways and has mobility benefits as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telerobotics.gsfc.nasa.gov/papers/TelepresenceSymposiumfinal.pdf  Space	Exploration Enabled by Telepresence: Combining	Science	and Human Exploration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217143104/http://telerobotics.gsfc.nasa.gov/papers/TelepresenceSymposiumfinal.pdf |date=2013-02-17 }} Based on Findings from: "Exploration Telerobotics Symposium". May 2-3, 2012 NASA Goddard Space Flight Center&lt;/ref&gt;

Return of the sample to orbit has the advantage that it permits analysis of the sample without delay, to detect volatiles that may be lost during a voyage home. This was the conclusion of a meeting of researchers at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in 2012.&lt;ref name="lpi.usra.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://telerobotics.gsfc.nasa.gov/papers/SymposiumReport-ExtendedVersion29Oct.pdf Space Exploration  Via Telepresence: The Case for Synergy Between Science and	Human Exploration, Findings and Observations from: "Exploration Telerobotics	Symposium".

[[File:Telerobotics image1 large.jpg|thumb|Telerobotics exploration of Mars]]

Similar methods could be used to directly explore other biologically sensitive moons such as [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], or [[Enceladus]], once the human presence in the vicinity becomes possible.

'''Intra-species recognition''' is the recognition by a member of a [[species]] of a [[conspecific]] (another member of the same species).  In many species, such recognition is necessary for procreation.

Different species may employ different methods, but all of them are based on one or more [[sense]]s (after all, this is how the organism gathers information about the environment). The recognition may happen by [[chemistry|chemical]] signature ([[olfaction|smell]]), by having a distinctive shape or color ([[Visual perception|sight]]), by emitting certain sounds ([[hearing (sense)|hearing]]), or even by behaviour patterns. Often a combination of these is used.

Among [[human being]]s, the sense of sight is usually in charge of recognizing other members of the same species, with maybe the subconscious help of smell. In particular, the human [[brain]] has a disproportionate amount of processing power dedicated to finely analyze the features of a human face. This is why we are able to distinguish basically all six billions of human beings from each other (barring [[look-alike]]s), and a human being from a similar species like some anthropomorphic [[ape]], with only a quick glance.

Intra-species recognition systems are often subtle.  For example, ornithologists have great difficulty in distinguishing the [[Common chiffchaff|chiffchaff]] from the [[willow warbler]] by eye, and there is no evidence that the birds themselves can do so other than by the different [[Bird vocalization|songs]] of the male.  Sometimes, intra-species recognition is fallible: in many species of [[frog]], the males are not uncommonly seen copulating with females of the wrong species or even with inanimate objects.

''[[Heliconius charithonia]]'' displays intra-species recognition by roosting with conspecifics.  They do this with the help of UV rhodopsins in the eye that help them distinguish between ultraviolet yellow pigments and regular yellow pigments.&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, Seth M., Furong Yuan, Monica D.

'''John of Luxembourg''' (died 22 June 1476) was Count of Marle and [[Count of Soissons]] between 1462 and 1476, Lord of [[Dunkirk]], [[Gravelines]] and [[Bourbourg]].

He was the eldest son of [[Louis de Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol]] and [[Jeanne de Bar, Countess of Marle and Soissons]].&lt;br&gt;
When his mother died in 1462, he became Count of Marle and Soissons.&lt;br&gt;
John became a Knight in the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] in 1473.&lt;br&gt;
When his father was beheaded for treason in 1475, John wasn't able to inherite his lands, because they were confiscated.

John was killed one year later at the [[Battle of Morat]].

He never married and his lands went to his younger brother [[Peter II, Count of Saint-Pol|Peter]].

[[File:Aldea.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Juan de Dios Aldea on the Monument to the Heroes of Iquique, Valparaíso]]

'''Juan de Dios Aldea''' (1853–1879) was a [[Chile]]an sailor. His remains rest in the crypt of the Monument to the Heroes of the [[Battle of Iquique]], in [[Valparaíso]].

== Early life ==
He was born to a modest family. He was the son of professor Jose Manuel Aldea and Ursula Fonseca.   His childhood was spent in [[Santiago]] with his paternal grandparents, Juan de Dios Aldea and Maria Antonieta Contreras.  At the age of 8 he enrolled in the Franciscan School of [[Chillán]], directed by his father. Here he distinguished himself with his excellent handwriting and his evident interest for military exercises.

== Career ==
After living for four years with his aunt, on August 1, 1872, he enrolled as a volunteer soldier in the Financial Commission sent by the Navy's Artillery Battalion; an organization located in [[Valparaiso]] which was dependent on the General Command of the [[Chilean Navy]].  In this battalion, he also served as a chief.

He stayed in the First Company of that battalion for two years.  In April 1874 he was sent on commission to [[Valdivia]] and on May 11 was promoted to 2nd Corporal.

On January 1, 1876 he was promoted to 1st Corporal, and a year later to 2nd Sergeant.

In June 1877 he embarked on the corvette [[Esmeralda (1855)|''Esmeralda'']]. In February 1878 he was transferred to the pontoon ''Thalaba'', and, after staying a month, he returned to the First Company of the Battalion. In October he was back in the ''Thalaba'' and in December returned to the Company of the Battalion, having transferred to the post of Guard of the Municipality of Valparaíso.

[[File:Sinking of the Esmeralda during the battle of Iquique.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Battle of Iquique|Naval Battle of Iquique]] during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1884).]]

Due to his impeccable service record, upon the declaration of the [[War of the Pacific]], he was assigned to the corvette ''Esmeralda''.

On May 21, 1879, the ''Esmeralda'', along with the [[Spanish schooner Virgen de Covadonga|''Covadonga'']], blockaded the Peruvian port of [[Iquique]]. After the lookout of the ''Covadonga'' spotted the Peruvian ships [[Huáscar (ironclad)|''Huascar'']] and [[Peruvian ironclad Independencia|''Independencia'']], Aldea joined the gunners and took over their combat post. After an hour of combat, the Peruvian Commander [[Miguel Grau Seminario]] ordered the ''Huascar'' to ram the Esmeralda.

The '''Judoon''' are a fictional [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] species of [[mercenary]] [[police]] from the British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] programme ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and [[Spin-off (media)|its spin-offs]]. They first appeared in the episode "[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]" in 2007, at which time, The Doctor was portrayed by David Tennant.

==Depiction==
===Characteristics===
Judoon are [[galactic]] police, brutal in their precise application of the law and highly logical in their battle tactics, but not very intelligent. In fact, [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] states that, whilst their behaviour is (on the surface) that of a [[military police]] force, they are really little more than "interplanetary thugs". They have no jurisdiction on Earth and no authority to deal with human crime (when hunting a fugitive alien in an Earth hospital, they transported the building to the Moon); they will, however, strictly obey any laws on the planet they are on (e.g. road speed limits).&lt;ref&gt;''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' Season 3, Episode 1, ''Prisoner of the Judoon''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Judoon carry [[Raygun|energy weapons]] which can incinerate humans.

Judoon are upright-standing [[Bipedalism|bipeds]], with [[rhinoceros]]-like heads and only four digits on each hand: they wear black, bulky armour with heavy boots. According to the Doctor, the Judoon have a "great big lung reserve" which allows them to survive for extended periods in a limited oxygen environment. They have yellow blood.

===History===
In "[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]", the Doctor had never encountered the race on-screen before, but during the episode he repeatedly demonstrates considerable knowledge of them and their methods. The Judoon used an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Scoop to bring a hospital which held the Tenth Doctor and [[Martha Jones]] to the moon where the Judoon could apprehend a criminal (species Plasmavore), which disguised itself as [[List of Doctor Who villains#Florence Finnegan|Florence Finnegan]]. The Judoon came in [[List of Doctor Who vehicles#Judoon rocket|ships]] and landed on the moon, trying to find Finnigan with their scanners, but at first couldn't due to Finnigan assimilating human blood. However she was revealed when Finnigan took the Doctor (a non-human)'s blood. They executed her for murdering an alien princess and afterwards transported the hospital back to Earth.

In ''[[Revenge of the Slitheen]]'', from the spin-off series ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'', they were mentioned by the [[Slitheen]], who said that the Intergalactic Police were after them.

In the novella ''[[Revenge of the Judoon]]'', where they seized [[Balmoral Castle]] in 1902 after being conned into a fraudulent mission, they made a deal with the Doctor that meant Earth was off-limits to them, something confirmed as canonical with the TV series by the BBC ''Monster Files'' feature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/videos/S4_08 BBC – Doctor Who – Videos – Series Four&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Judoon are also mentioned in the ''Doctor Who Adventures'' comic "The Great Mordillo."

They appear in "[[The Stolen Earth]]" as guards at the Shadow Proclamation. The [[TARDIS]] does not translate their language, because it is the universal law, like The Shadow Proclamation, and the Doctor replies in their language rather than in English. They only begin speaking English once he has introduced himself.

In ''[[Prisoner of the Judoon]]'', Captain Tybo, a Judoon, crashes on Earth while his prisoner, Androvax, escapes, leaving Tybo hunting for him. He is knocked unconscious by Androvax and saved by [[Sarah Jane Smith]] and her gang, who helped him find Androvax 'the Annihilator' who, as a veil form, has the ability to possess people; he uses this to possess Sarah Jane. Captain Tybo commandeers a [[London Metropolitan Police]] car and goes to Bannerman Road where he receives a call that more Judoon are coming. When Tybo and the gang go in they find that Sarah Jane has ordered [[Mr Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Mr Smith]] to blow up in 60 seconds, but [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke]] stops him by reminding him that he is programmed to protect the planet. Tybo goes to the genetic system and regroups with the rest of the Judoon, finds Androvax and takes him back to the [[Whoniverse#Features|Shadow Proclamation]].  Despite the Judoon's nominal lack of jurisdiction on Earth, Tybo aggressively enforces English car radio volume limits and once points his machine gun at the driver of a nearby car whose music was too loud. Additionally, he and his colleagues summarily sentence [[Clyde Langer]] and [[Rani Chandra (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Rani Chandra]] to restriction to Earth as punishment for their interference.

Judoon are seen as part of an alliance of the Doctor's enemies in "[[The Pandorica Opens]]", who imprison him in the Pandorica beneath Stonehenge, believing he will destroy the Universe.

In "[[A Good Man Goes to War]]", a small group of Judoon are recruited by the Doctor to join his army in the Battle of Demon's Run. Alongside [[Sontaran]] commander Strax, a large battalion of [[Silurian (Doctor Who)|Silurian]] warriors, and the [[The Curse of the Black Spot|newly space-pirating]] former crew of [[Henry Every|the ''Fancy'']], they help to apprehend Colonel Manton and his Cleric forces.

Individual Judoon are seen in a handful of other episodes: eyeing a [[Slitheen|Raxacoricofallapatorian]] in a Zagizalgul bar in ''[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]''; when [[List of Doctor Who hencmen#Colony Sarff|Colony Sarff]] visits the Shadow Proclamation in "[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]; and living in the trap street in "[[Face the Raven]]".

'''''Kasztanka''''' ({{IPAc-pl|k|a|sz|'|t|a|N|k|a}}; [[Polish language|Polish]] for "chestnut mare"; born 1909 or 1910, died November 23, 1927) was the famous [[mare]] that belonged to [[Second Polish Republic|interwar Poland]]'s leader, Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]]. 

==Life==
[[File:Kossak Wojciech - Piłsudski on Horseback.jpg|thumb|left|''Piłsudski on Horseback'', astride Kasztanka, by [[Wojciech Kossak]]&lt;ref name="Kossak"/&gt;]]
''Kasztanka'' is the [[Polish language|Polish]] word for the [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] color in mares, and Piłsudski so named his horse due to her color. 

She was foaled at Ludwik Popiel's ''Czaple Małe'' (Little Herons) estate probably in 1909 or 1910, and reared at his ''Czaple Wielkie'' (Great Herons) estate, in [[Miechów County]], [[Kraków Voivodeship|Kraków Province]]. Offered by her owner to the riflemen of the [[I Brigade of the Polish Legions|First Brigade]] of the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]], she became the service mount of Commandant [[Józef Piłsudski]], who entered [[Kielce]] on her in August 1914 and kept her as a riding horse until her untimely death 13 years later.&lt;ref name="Kukawski"&gt;{{cite web

She was an elegant mare of moderate height, about {{hands|14.3}} at the [[withers]], [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]] (light reddish-brown) in color, with [[horse markings|markings]] that included a blaze and four white stockings.  

Kasztanka was [[Józef Piłsudski]]'s favorite horse and faithful companion in the Polish Legions' battles at the side of [[Austro-Hungary]] and [[German Empire|Germany]] in [[World War I]], for the independence of Poland. Indeed, she acknowledged only Piłsudski. Her task was to carry the Commandant during the First Brigade's marches. She was not remarkable for any unique [[horse gait|gait]] nor for extraordinary feats of courage, but she was very loyal. Kasztanka was somewhat high-strung and hated [[artillery]] fire, but when her master asked, she remained controlled and obedient under difficult conditions, reciprocating his devotion.&lt;ref name="Kukawski"/&gt;

The [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]]' First Uhlan Regiment, commanded by Colonel [[Władysław Belina-Prażmowski]], presented Piłsudski with new trappings for Kasztanka, and it was in these that she henceforth appeared.&lt;ref name="Kukawski"/&gt;

In 1922 Kasztanka went to [[Mińsk Mazowiecki]] into the care of the 7th [[Lublin]] Uhlan Regiment. From there she would be sent to [[Warsaw]] when Marshal Piłsudski, as Commander-in-Chief, was to take part in state ceremonies and, seated astride Kasztanka, review military parades. When he was at his country house in [[Sulejówek]], the mare was sometimes brought there to visit, especially to the Marshal's daughters, [[Wanda Piłsudska|Wanda]] and Jadwiga.&lt;ref name="Kukawski" /&gt;

Kasztanka gave birth to two [[foal]]s over the course of her life, a [[colt (horse)|colt]] and a [[filly]]. Other than that in both cases she gave birth when she was stabled at the 7th Uhlan Regiment in [[Mińsk Mazowiecki]], little information has been preserved concerning their sires, except that they were government-owned [[stallion]]s. The colt, a [[gray (horse)|gray]] named ''Niemen'' after the [[Niemen River|river]], inherited only his dam's good looks but not her personality; he was lazy. He was proposed to succeed Kasztanka in serving Marshal Piłsudski, but never did.&lt;ref name="Kukawski" /&gt; Kasztanka's filly, which Piłsudski christened ''Mera'' in memory of the river that flowed through [[Zułów]], the family estate where he had been born, was foaled April 10, 1925, and was a chestnut like Kasztanka.  In 1930, according to her surviving records, Mera was in the care of the First Light Cavalry Regiment as "officer's service horse of First Marshal Józef Piłsudski."&lt;ref name="Kukawski" /&gt;

Marshal Piłsudski rode Kasztanka for the last time on November 11, 1927, at the Polish Independence Day parade on [[Warsaw]]'s Saxon Square (now [[Piłsudski Square]]).&lt;ref name="Kukawski"/&gt;

==Death==
Ten days after Kasztanka's final parade, on November 21, 1927, she was sent by rail back to the 7th Uhlan Regiment at [[Mińsk Mazowiecki]], where she was stabled. However, she became ill or injured en route and died two days later. The final report on her, in an addendum to the Regimental order of the day dated November 25, 1927, read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"On November 3, 1927, the mare Kasztanka, property of Marshal Piłsudski, was sent to Warsaw for a parade celebrating the ninth anniversary of Poland's Independence on November 11.  She was sent on the instructions of the military cabinet of the Minister of Military Affairs.  Kasztanka was a saddle mare that had been ridden by Marshal Piłsudski since 1914.  Kasztanka took part on November 11 in the parade, being mounted for the last time by Marshal Piłsudski.  On November 21, 1927, she was sent by rail transport to Mińsk Mazowiecki, and became ill en route.  Upon arrival at the railroad station, despite assistance rendered by the 7th Uhlan Regiment's doctor of veterinary medicine, Lt. W. Koppe, she was unable to rise.  She was transported to barracks.  In view of the worsening state of her health, veterinary assistance was summoned from Warsaw, and on the night of November 21–22 Lt. Col. Konrad Millak and Lt. Col. Władysław Kulczycki arrived.  These doctors of veterinary medicine took further energetic measures.  They did not succeed in improving the state of [Kasztanka's] health, and at 10 o'clock that day they issued the following assessment:  'Grave internal [[Physical trauma|trauma]]... severe distress to [[blood vessel]]s and [[heart]].' Kasztanka died on November 23, 1927, at five o'clock in the morning."&lt;ref name="Kukawski" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The order of the day was signed by the 7th Uhlan Regiment's commander at the time, Lt. Col. Zygmunt Piasecki, who later complained that after Kasztanka's death Marshal Piłsudski would not talk to him.&lt;ref name="Kukawski" /&gt;  

Reportedly on the train, Kasztanka had attempted to get to the other side of a partition and had struck her backbone against a pole with all her force, and this was the cause of her injury and death.&lt;ref name="Kierklewicz"&gt;{{cite web
|last = Kierklewicz

&lt;!--Curious if more sources on this--the description of her death suggests that she may have colicked, which is common when shipping, and thrashing around when colicking could have caused such an injury, and a twisted intestine is consistent with the "injury to blood vessels and heart" postmortem.  See [[horse colic]]--&gt;

==Legacy==
After her death, Kasztanka's body underwent [[taxidermy]]; in this form, after Marshal Piłsudski's death in 1935, she was given a place in the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]] museum.  The rest of her remains were buried in a park at the barracks of the 7th Uhlan Regiment, beneath a stone inscribed, "Here lies ''KASZTANKA'', favorite combat mare of Marshal Piłsudski."&lt;ref name="Kukawski" /&gt;

During [[World War II]], under German occupation, the stuffed ''Kasztanka'' ended up in Warsaw's Museum of the Polish Armed Forces. The mount survived the war, but due to lack of routine care for the collections, was badly damaged by [[moth]]s. After the war she was probably [[cremate]]d. By some accounts, this was done at the behest of [[Marshal of Poland|Marshal]] [[Michał Rola-Żymierski]], who had opposed Marshal Piłsudski's [[May Coup (Poland)|May 1926 Coup d'État]] and been [[court-martial]]led and demoted from general to private, but during World War II had been restored by the [[Soviet Union]]'s Marshal [[Joseph Stalin]] to the rank of general and on May 3, 1945, promoted to Marshal.&lt;ref name="Kukawski" /&gt;

==In art==
Kasztanka earned a place not only in the hearts of Marshal Piłsudski and his family, but in those of their countrymen. She became an [[equine]] [[celebrity]]. The first songs of Polish soldiers during [[World War I]], written by K. Biernacki and B. Lubicz, featured ''Kasztanka''.&lt;ref name="Kierklewicz" /&gt;

She was also a subject of [[Wojciech Kossak]]'s 1928 painting ''Piłsudski on Horseback'', which hangs in the [[National Museum, Warsaw]].&lt;ref name="Kossak"&gt;{{cite web

|work=Gallery of Polish Painting Masterpieces
|accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This painting remains one of the most popular artistic portrayals of Piłsudski.

''Kasztanka'' figured as well in satirical artwork and songs produced by Piłsudski's political opponents.&lt;ref name="Kierklewicz" /&gt;

In 1940 he was appointed Head of the  Municipal Museums of [[Strasbourg]] as well as Chief Commissioner of the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] Museums. In 1956 he  became Director of the  Karlsruher Kunstakademie (Academy of Art Karlsruhe), and in 1957 General  Director of the [[Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen|Bayerischen Staatsgemäldesammlungen]] (Bavarian State Painting Collection).

Martin was a [[Protestant]]. He was married to Dr. med. Hildegard Wangrin since 1928.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{NDB|16|281|282|Martin, Kurt|Elfriede Schulze-Battmann|116805188}} ("''Martin, Kurt", New German Biography'')&lt;/ref&gt;

== Childhood, adolescence, participation in the war and studies ==

Kurt Martin was born on January 31, 1899 in [[Zurich]], as the third son of Rudolf Martin (1864–1925), professor of [[anthropology]] from Baden, and his wife Anna Hein (1865–1940). In [[Zurich]], he attended elementary school before changing to the [[Secondary education in France|École]] Nouvelle in [[Lausanne]] and later to a [[secondary school]] in [[Karlsruhe]]. There he passed his [[Abitur]] (final secondary school examinations) in 1917. He served as a soldier in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Tessa Friederike Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin und das Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg. Museums- und Ausstellungspolitik im 'Dritten Reich‘ und in der unmittelbaren Nachkriegszeit", ''(Kurt Martin and the Fine Arts Museum in Strasbourg. Exhibition and Museum Policies in the Third Reich and right after the war)'' Akademie-Verlag, Berlin 2012, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 he started his  [[philosophy]]  studies  (among  others  with [[Martin Heidegger]]  and  [[Edmund Husserl]])  and majored in [[art history]] (with [[Hans Jantzen]]) at the [[Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg|University of Freiburg]]. He completed his art studies in 1924 at the [[Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München]] with [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945) with his PhD thesis on the subject of "Die Nürnberger Steinplastik im 14. Jahrhundert" (The Nuremberger [[Effigy]] in the 14th century).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== 1927 - 1934: Mannheim and Badisches Landesmuseum (''Baden State Museum'') ==

Martin started his career in 1927 as a volunteer at the [[Kunsthalle Mannheim]] (''Art Gallery Mannheim'') with Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub. Soon he was appointed research assistant and subsequently [[curator]] at the Baden State Museum, [[Karlsruhe]]. In 1931 he addressed himself to the task of organizing the exhibition "German Poets as Painters and Drawers" for the Kunstverein (''art society'') [[Heidelberg]].

== Badisches Armeemuseum (''Army Museum of Baden'') ==

In the early 1930s Martin met [[Robert Heinrich Wagner|Robert Wagner]], a confidant of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[NSDAP]] politician with whom Martin would have to do until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee: "Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich". Wer war was vor und nach 1945. (''Dictionary of the people of the Third Reich. Who was who before and after 1945'') Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, 2nd updated edition, Frankfurt am Main 2005,&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|978-3-596-16048-8}}, p.&amp;nbsp;651, s.&amp;nbsp;a. Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", p.&amp;nbsp;25–34&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1933 Wagner commissioned Martin with the development and organization of an army museum of Baden. Together with the retired [[Colonel]] Erich Blankenhorn, who had just been dismissed as chief of the Badische [[Landespolizei]] (''[[State Police]] of Baden)'' by the new rulers, he built up an independent museum under the aegis of the Baden State Museum Karlsruhe (Badisches Landesmuseum).&lt;ref&gt;Vereinigung der Freunde des Wehrgeschichtlichen Museums Schloss Rastatt e.&amp;nbsp;V. [ed.]:&amp;nbsp;''Gang durch die Geschichte. 75&amp;nbsp;Jahre Wehrgeschichtliches Museum und 50 Jahre Vereinigung der Freunde des WGM. ''Katalog zur Sonderausstellung 18. Juli bis 31.

Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", pp.&amp;nbsp;49–53&lt;/ref&gt; For this purpose premises were made available in the former stables of the [[Karlsruhe]] Palace, the residence of the State museum. On May 13, 1934 Robert Wagner and Kurt Martin inaugurated the museum with 80.000 guests and two days of celebration. Besides departments of the army of the Reich ([[Reichswehr]]) and color guards of the military associations, a row of delegations of [[National Socialist|NS]]-organizations, including [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], [[SS]] and Reich Labor Service ([[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]), marched up in the [[demilitarized zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Der Führer, edition: 13 May 1934: "Militär-Großkonzert mit Schlachtenfeuerwerk im Stadtgarten", "Der Aufmarsch am Sonntag", "Ruf an die Soldaten", "Ein Rundgang durchs Armee-Museum" (''"Grand military concert and battle fireworks in the city garden", "The deployment in sunday", "Call to the soldiers", "A tour through the Army Museum")''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Der Führer, edition: 13 May 1934,&amp;nbsp;Le Temps, 13 May 1934, p.&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;"DÉPÊCHES DE L' ÉTRANGER", s.&amp;nbsp;a. Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", pp.&amp;nbsp;49–53&lt;/ref&gt;

In his opening speech from the balcony of the palace, Martin declared that the museum had benefited from over one thousand donations of military [[antique]]s. The museum was not only supposed to include the [[regiment]]s of Baden, but also the regiments of the earlier 15th Alsatian army corps. The museum was supposed to be a "speaking memorial, teaching everyone the military-political achievements of our frontier people. [...] Here the youth shall learn to respect and understand the achievements of their fathers."&lt;ref&gt;Badische Werkkunst, (''Art creation in Baden'') Year 1934/35, August, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–4 and Durlacher Tagblatt, edition: 14 May 1934&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner said about the purposes of the museum: "What is given to the public today in the shape of the Army Museum is nothing else than an intellectual [[:wikt:legacy|legacy]] from a time of struggling and fighting for our [[Germany]] for the struggle and fight for our [[Germany]]."&lt;ref&gt;Der Führer, edition: 13 May 1934, p. 1: "Das Badische Armeemuseum eröffnet: Ein Stützpunkt deutscher Zukunftshoffnung. Riesenkundgebung auf dem Karlsruher Schloßplatz – Reichsstatthalter Robert Wagner über die Bedeutung des Museums" ("''The Badische Armeemuseum opens: A base for german hope for the future: Great manifestation on the Schlossplatz in Karlsruhe - The Reichstatthalter Robert Wagner on the importance of the museum"'')&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the exhibition was nothing more than a "Potemkin village". Erich Blankenhorn commented on the state of the museum on the date of the opening and said that due to the short preparation period "it was only possible to decorate the first royal stables with historically incoherent paintings and objects." For that reason the museum was closed one day after the opening.&lt;ref&gt;Vereinigung der Freunde des Wehrgeschichtlichen Museums Schloss Rastatt e.V. [ed..]: "Gang durch die Geschichte", p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1934: Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (''National Art Gallery Karlsruhe'') ==

On July 2, 1934 Wagner appointed Martin head of the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe]] (''National Art Gallery Karlsruhe''). He succeeded Hans Adolf Bühler who was loyal to the party line and whose management of the museum was characterized by a radical opposition to the so-called degenerate art.&lt;ref&gt;Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", p.&amp;nbsp;63&lt;/ref&gt; Martin remained head of the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle]] until 1956.

=== Exhibitions 1934-1940 ===

Between 1934 and 1939 the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle]] was limited in its activities. In the years between 1934 and 1937 the orangery building of the [[botanical garden]] was remodeled in order to accommodate a special department for the [[Baden]] paintings of the late [[19th]] and [[20th]] century as from 1938. Since 1934 the department of the old [[Germans|German]] [[Masterpiece]]s had been reorganized. It was reopened to the public in 1937. Finally, the also redesigned department of the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Flemish]] painters reopened as well.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen. Jg. 8 (1939) (''Yearbook of the Museums of the Upper Rhine, 8th year''), pp. 199-203; Rosebrock loc. cit., p. 61 and 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1934 and 1937 several exhibitions were organized in the gallery of prints, including an exhibition about [[Hans Thoma]] in 1934 and an exhibition of the most recent acquisitions of old German masterpieces by the Staatliche Kunsthalle in 1936.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Furthermore, two travelling exhibitions were organized for the [[elementary schools]] in Baden. In 1936 an exhibition about Hans Thoma was shown in 55 locations and totaled about 90.000 visitors, and in 1937 an exhibition about [[Albrecht Dürer]] was shown in 25 locations and registered about 45.000 visitors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Between 1934 and 1937 the Staatliche Kunsthalle organized annually, among others, about forty tours for the [[Reichsarbeitsdienst]] (''Reichs Labor Service''), the organization "Kraft durch Freude" ([[Strength Through Joy|KdF]]) (''Strength Through Joy''), the [[NS-Frauenschaft]] (''Nazi women’s organization''), the sisterhood of the Red Cross and schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Just before the beginning of the [[war]], on July 2, 1939, the museum was reopened and back in full operation.&lt;ref&gt;Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (Tätigkeitsbericht 1938/39 - ''activity report 1938/1939''), in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen (''Yearbook of the Upper Rhine Museums)'' Year 9, 1940, P. 226–227,  s.&amp;nbsp;a. Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", p.&amp;nbsp;62&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the Kunsthalle celebrated its 100th anniversary. On this occasion [[Robert Wagner]] opened a memorial exhibition for Hans Thoma showing 180 works. Besides private collectors and galleries, the [[Nationalgalerie]] (''National Gallery'') in [[Berlin]], the [[Hamburger Kunsthalle]] (''Art Gallery Hamburg'') and the Städtische Galerie Frankfurt (''Municipal Gallery Frankfurt'') contributed to this exhibition with loans. Martin meant to present Thoma as "a master of the German landscape and as a great portraitist".&lt;ref&gt;e. g. "Hans-Thoma-Schau in Karlsruhe (…) Unterredung mit Direktor Dr. Martin von der Staatlichen Kunsthalle" ''("Hans Thoma show in Karlsruhe (...) Discussion with director Dr. Martin from the Staatliche Kunsthalle")''and from 2 July 1939, p.4: "Hans-Thoma-Gedächtnis-Ausstellung in Karlsruhe. 180 auserlesene Meisterwerke – Die erste Ausstellung in Deutschland zum 100jährigen Geburtstag des Meisters" ("''Hans Thoma memorial exhibition in Karlsruhe. 180 chosen masterpieces - The first exhibition in Germany for the 100th birthday of the Master"'')&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the newly renovated "Feuerbachsaal" was reopened to the public. It contained the German paintings of the 19th century that had been "rearranged". The [[state government]] of Baden donated a work of [[Trübner]], and the city of [[Karlsruhe]] a work of Thoma.

From 1940 on, the [[Kunsthalle]] remained closed.&lt;ref&gt;Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen. (''Yearbook of the Upper Rhine Museums)'' Year 8 (1939), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art acquisitions in general ===

Between 1934 and 1937 the Kunsthalle acquired 115 paintings under the direction of Martin, including works of [[Hans Thoma]], Emil Lugo and Hermann Daur.&lt;ref&gt;Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen. Jg. 8 (1939) (''Yearbook of the Museums of the Upper Rhine, 8th year''), P. 199-203. According to Rosebrock, P. 61 and 75 Martin would have closed the museum for a few years after beginning to work there. It would have been his goal to draw the public attention away from the museum through that. The renovation works therefore would only have been a pretext.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1938 to 1939 the Kunsthalle acquired 53 paintings. Martin emphasized paintings of [[Wilhelm Trübner]], [[Anselm Feuerbach]] and [[Hans Thoma]] in his account report. Among the works that were marked as "transfers" were paintings by Karl Buchholz, Hermann Burte, [[Joseph Fratrel]] and [[Adolph von Menzel]]. At the same time the Kunsthalle acquired 175 drawings, 636 graphic print works and four sketchbooks. Regarding the drawings, Martin emphasized eight sheets by [[Ferdinand Kobell]], three by [[Franz Kobell]] and nine by [[Wilhelm Trübner]], as well as – a gift of the NSDAP-Gauleitung of Baden – the "valuable early drawing of [[Hans Thoma]], Schönau im Wiesental (Schönau in the valley of Wiesen)".&lt;ref&gt;Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (Tätigkeitsbericht 1938/39 - activity report 1938/1939), in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen. (''Yearbook of the Upper Rhine'') Year 9, 1940, P. 226–227, Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P. 61–64&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, the collection of the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe "was enriched by a few works mainly by artists from Baden". For example, the museum acquired paintings from Albert Lang, Fritz Boehle, [[Ferdinand Keller (painter)|Ferdinand Keller]], Ernst Württemberger, and Eduard Hunziker, and several drawings by [[Hans Thoma]] and [[Ferdinand Keller (painter)|Ferdinand Keller]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe, in Oberrheinische Kunst. Jahrbuch der oberrheinischen Museen. (''Yearbook of the Upper Rhine Museum)'' Year 8 (1939), S. 199-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his activities report for the year 1940, Martin wrote: "The General Administration managed to accomplish a few essential acquisitions for the public museums which will be reported about later in context."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Art acquisition from Jewish collections ===

The Kunsthalle Karlsruhe continuously took over art works from originally Jewish property. In a statement from 1947, Martin listed about 100 works, including works from the collections of [[Richard Lenel]], Mannheim (one work), Benno Weil, Mannheim (one work), Siegfried Reiss, Mannheim (44 works), Arthur Levis, Karlsruhe (one work), E. Reiss, Heidelberg (three works), Paul Homburger, Karlsruhe (three works), [[Ettlinger]], Karlsruhe (one work),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ehre: "Monument Man" in Karlsruhe {{!}} Jüdische Allgmeine|url = http://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/article/view/id/18414|website = www.juedische-allgemeine.de|accessdate = 2015-06-10|first = "Monument Man in Karlsruhe", from the Jüdische Allegmeine, February 18th, 2014|last = Article from Georg Patzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klara Goldschmit, Karlsruhe, Salomon, Karlsruhe (one work), Ernst Gallinek, Baden Baden (16 works and a porcelain collection including more than 400 objects)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lostart.de/Webs/EN/Datenbank/EinzelobjektFund.html?cms_param=EOBJ_ID%3D407997%26_page%3D0%26_sort%3Dperson_en%26_anchor%3Did4442|title = Lost Art Database|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = See|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Violetta von Waldberg, Heidelberg (wife of [[Max von Waldberg]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = German Website of the Historical Society of Heidelberg (Heidelberger Geschichtsverein e.V.) on the life of Max von Waldberg|url = http://www.s197410804.online.de/Personen/WaldbergM.htm|website = www.s197410804.online.de|accessdate = 2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (four works). The Kunsthalle took over these works from other State authorities that had expropriated the previous owners. Most of the works mentioned by Martin were transferred to the Kunsthalle from authorities, partly against payment. The Kunsthalle acquired 20 works on its own initiative from an "Auction Sale of Jewish Property 6th-9th August 1941 in Karlsruhe".&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Martin: ''Verzeichnis der von der Staatlichen Kunsthalle Karlsruhe seit 1933 aus jüdischen Besitz erworbenen Gemälde, Zeichnungen und druckgraphische Blätter''.

Badischer Kunstverein Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe 1987 (''Art society of Baden''), P. 139, 155. and Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Kurt Martin acquired the work ''Portrait of the Marchesa Veronica Spinola Doria'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] for 63.000 Reichsmark at the liquidation auction of the gallery van Diemen &amp; Co. GmbH.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Graupe (Editor): ''Die Bestände der Firmen [[Eduard Plietzsch|Galerie van Diemen &amp; Co.]]GmbH – Altkunst, Antiquitäten, GmbH: beide in Liquidation''; II.

In 2000 a new compensation was claimed without success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe (State Art Gallery of Karlsruhe)|url = http://www.lootedart.com/MFEU4D92814_print%25253bY|website = www.lootedart.com|accessdate = 2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This acquisition was not mentioned in the report for the years 1934 until 1937.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1940 - 1944: "Oberrheinische" museums ("''Upper Rhine" museums'') ===
With the occupation of [[Alsatia]], Robert Wagner became chief of the Alsatian [[Civilian]] [[Administration (government)|Administration]] and had complete political freedom. It was his main objective to ensure that Alsatia become "German" again, in particular that [[Strasbourg]] become the "preeminent first cultural center of the [[German Reich]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P.&amp;nbsp;30–34&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued this goal in the performing arts by founding several theatres and establishing German libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Lothar Kettenacker: "Nationalsozialistische Volkstumspolitik im Elsaß", Stuttgart 1973, P.&amp;nbsp;180–183 ''(Nazi Nation Politics in Alsatia'')&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he prohibited the use of the French language in public and Germanized all toponyms.&lt;ref&gt;Kettenacker: a.&amp;nbsp;a.&amp;nbsp;O., P.&amp;nbsp;74&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt Martin was responsible for the museums and helped Wagner prepare his "vision of a cultural model-district Alsatia-Baden".&lt;ref&gt;Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P.&amp;nbsp;83f&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State representative for the museums in Alsatia ===
[[File:Master of Frankfurt 002.jpg|thumb|NK 2556: Master of Frankfurt – ''St. Christopherus'', 1942, bought from Paul Cassirer, Amsterdam]]
On November 17, 1940, as "State Representative for the Museums in Alsatia", Martin describes the initial situation in [[Strasbourg]] in the light of the new political realities in an article about the future of the museums in "our land at the Upper Rhine": In the city, the Palais Rohan&lt;ref&gt;The Archeological Museum (Musée Archéologique), the Decorative Arts Museum (Musée des Arts décoratifs), the Graphic and Print Museum (Cabinet des estampes et dessins) and the Museum of Fine Arts (Musée des Beaux-arts) were located in the Palais Rohan.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Frauenhausmuseum]] unite the architecture of the Middle Ages and the 18th century in a "unique way in Germany". This unity is also reflected in the museums' inventories. Martin aimed especially at the development of museums as places of national education with a regional and local focus.

With this scope in mind, Martin aimed at the expansion of the Strasbourg collection "on [[Europe]]an grounds". He wanted to develop the collection as a collection of European significance.&lt;ref&gt;Der Führer, Sonderausgabe (''Special Edition'') 17.11.1940, "Museen am Oberrhein" (''Museums of the Upper Rhine'')&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Director of the Municipal Museums of Strasbourg and Chief Commissioner of the Upper Rhine Museums ===
At the instigation of Wagner, Martin became director of the Municipal Museums of Strasbourg.&lt;ref&gt;Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P. 90&lt;/ref&gt; He also kept his position in Karlsruhe. As of April 1, 1941 he became the Director of the General Administration of the Upper Rhine Museums, thus of all museums in Baden and Alsatia.

=== Purchase of art in the Netherlands ===
From 1941 to 1944, Martin purchased about 40 paintings and a series of other objet d'arts in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Distilled overview by Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P. 125 Remark number 171, above all P. 147–160 and P. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Some works with Dutch provenance, which Martin purchased, are part of the Dutch art collection (NK Collection) today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herkomstgezocht.nl/eng/nkcollectie/index.html NK-Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924025801/http://www.herkomstgezocht.nl/eng/nkcollectie/index.html |date=2015-09-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the database of the NK Collection, the following purchases of Martin are listed:

Kurt Martin was able to reintegrate his position as director of the [[Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe]] immediately in the summer of 1945, especially because Walter W. Horn, officers from the French Art Protection and his former French colleagues from Strasbourg confirmed his great integrity and qualification. Martin supported the French and American authorities in locating and rescuing the artworks that had been stored for purposes of protection during wartime.&lt;ref&gt;Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P.&amp;nbsp;253–261&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 he co-founded the [[International Council of Museums]] and remained director of the German National Committee for 15 years. From 1948 until shortly before his death in 1975, he was a member of the administrative board of the Germanic National Museum in [[Nuremberg]].&lt;ref name="Elfriede Schulze-Battmann 1990"&gt;Elfriede Schulze-Battmann:&amp;nbsp;''Martin, Kurt.''&amp;nbsp;In:&amp;nbsp;''Neue Deutsche Biographie''&amp;nbsp;(NDB). ''(New German Biography)'' Volume&amp;nbsp;16, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Berlin 1990, {{ISBN|3-428-00197-4}}, S.&amp;nbsp;281&amp;nbsp;f. (Digitalisat).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947  he was already able to exhibit masterpieces of the museum in [[Saint Gall|St. Gall.]] In 1951 he reopened the museum in Karlsruhe. He added a pedagogical department to the museum, which was a novel idea at the time. In 1948 he curated an exhibition of German art for the [[Federal Foreign Office]], which was shown in several cities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Rosebrock: "Kurt Martin", P. 332f&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 he organized the exhibition ''Des maîtres de Cologne à Albrecht Dürer'' showing works of old German masters in Paris. He initiated the exhibition ''German watercolors, drawings and prints: A midcentury review'', which was shown by the German government in the US in 1956. Martin was one of the co-founders of the ''[[documenta]]'' in [[Kassel]], an exhibition for contemporary art that took place for the first in time 1956. He was a member of the documenta-council for many years.&lt;ref name="Elfriede Schulze-Battmann 1990"/&gt;

In 1956 he became director of the Academy of Art Karlsruhe. In 1957 he transferred to [[Munich]], succeeding Ernst Buchner in the General Direction of the [[Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen]] (''Bavarian State Painting Collections''). He retired in 1964. In Munich, Martin was responsible for the establishment of several museum branches in different cities in Bavaria. He also promoted the extension of the Munich Museum collections to contemporary art works.

== Appreciation ==
Kurt Martin was one of the leading museum directors of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Fork:&amp;nbsp;''Martin, Kurt''. In:&amp;nbsp;''Metzler Kunsthistoriker Lexikon. Zweihundertzehn Porträts deutschsprachiger Autoren aus vier Jahrhunderten.''&amp;nbsp;(''Metzler Dictionary of Art Historians. Two hundred portraits of German authors from four centuries'') 2nd edition. Metzler, Stuttgart 1999, P. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a wide range of research interests. He published several articles about the art of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the French painters of the 19th century and modern art.

In 1963 he received the Bavarian order of merit and in 1964 he was appointed to Dr.-Ing. e.h. by the TH Karlsruhe.

==Evansville Purple Aces plane crash==
In 1977, fourteen members of the [[Evansville Purple Aces men's basketball]] team [[Air Indiana Flight 216|died in a plane crash]], along with fifteen others. The players killed were: 
* Seniors: Kevin Kingston, John Ed Washington, and Marion Anthony “Tony” Windburn
* Juniors: Stephen Miller and Bryan Taylor
* Sophomores: Keith Moon
* Freshmen: Warren Alston, Ray Comandella, Mike Duff, Kraig Heckendorn, Michael Joyner, Barney Lewis, Greg Smith, and Mark Siegel
David Furr, the lone member of the team who did not board Air Indiana Flight 216, died two weeks later in a car accident, meaning all the members of the team died during the 1977-1978 season.

[[File:Hanako.jpg|thumb|[[Hanako (fish)|Hanako]], a Japanese [[Koi]] that lived for 226 years (1751–1977).]]

This is a list of the '''longest-living organisms'''; that is, the individual member(s) (or in some instances, [[cloning|clones]]) of a species. This may be, for a given species:

# Oldest verified known individuals that are currently alive
# Verified Record holders, such as the longest-lived human, [[Jeanne Calment]], or the longest-lived domestic cat, [[Creme Puff (cat)|Creme Puff]] (1967-2005)

Ordinarily, this does not consider the age of the species itself, comparing species by the range of age-span of their individuals, or the time between first appearance ([[speciation]]) and [[extinction]] of the species.

==Biological immortality==
[[File:Hydra-Foto.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydras]]'' may not [[senescence|grow old]].]]
{{Main|Biological immortality}}
If the mortality rate of a species does not increase after maturity, the species does not age and is said to be [[Biological immortality|biologically immortal]]. Many examples exist of plants and animals for which the mortality rate actually decreases with age, for all or part of the lifecycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(07)62033-8 |title=Evolution's greatest mistakes |year=2007 |author=Ainsworth, C |journal=New Scientist |volume=195 |pages=36–39 |last2=Lepage |first2=M|issue=2616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the mortality rate remains constant, the rate determines the mean lifespan. The lifespan can be long or short, though the species technically "does not age".

* ''[[Hydra (genus)|Hydra]]'' species were observed for four years without any increase in mortality rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martínez |first=Daniel E. |year=1998 |title=Mortality patterns suggest lack of senescence in Hydra |journal=Experimental Gerontology |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=217–225 |publisher=Elsevier Science Inc |doi=10.1016/S0531-5565(97)00113-7 |pmid=9615920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other species have been observed to regress to a larval state and regrow into adults multiple times.
 
* The [[hydrozoa]]n species ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]'' (formerly ''Turritopsis nutricula'') is capable of cycling from a mature adult stage to an immature [[polyp]] stage and back again. This means no natural limit to its lifespan is known.&lt;ref name=turritopsis&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Scott F. |year=2010 |url=http://9e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HGLFzSKv?url=http://9e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6 |archivedate=2013-06-10 |title=Developmental Biology |chapter=The Immortal Life Cycle of Turritopsis |edition=9th |publisher=Sinauer Associates |isbn=978-0-878-93384-6 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no single specimen has been observed for any extended period, and estimating the age of a specimen is not possible by any known means.
* At least one hydrozoan (''Laodicea'' undulata&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|title = Evidence of reverse development in Leptomedusae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa): the case of Laodicea undulata (Forbes and Goodsir 1851)|last = De Vito|date = 2006|journal = Marine Biology|volume = 149|issue = 2|pages = 339–346|doi = 10.1007/s00227-005-0182-3|pmid = |access-date = 2015-12-31|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and one scyphozoan (''Aurelia'' sp.1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|title = Life Cycle Reversal in Aurelia sp.1 (Cnidaria, Scyphozoa)|last = He|date = 2015-12-21|journal = PLoS ONE|volume = 10|issue = 12|pages = e0145314|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145314|pmid = 26690755|pmc = 4687044|access-date = 2015-12-31|display-authors=etal|bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1045314H}}&lt;/ref&gt;) can also revert from medusa stage into polyp stage.

* In July 2018, scientists from four [[Russia|Russian]] institutions collaborating with [[Princeton University]] reported that they had analyzed about 300 prehistoric worms recovered from [[permafrost]] above the [[Arctic Circle]] in [[Yakutia|Sakha Republic]], and that after being thawed, two of the [[nematode|nematodes]] revived and began moving and eating. One found in a [[Pleistocene]] [[squirrel]] burrow in the Duvanny Yar outcrop on the [[Kolyma River]] was believed to be about 32,000 years old, while the other, recovered in 2015 near the [[Alazeya River]], was dated at approximately 41,700 years old. These nematodes were believed to be the oldest living multicellular animals on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Worms frozen in permafrost for up to 42,000 years come back to life |url=https://siberiantimes.com/science/casestudy/news/worms-frozen-in-permafrost-for-up-to-42000-years-come-back-to-life/ |accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with all long-lived plant and fungal species, no individual part of a [[clonal colony]] is [[Characteristics of life|alive]] (in the sense of active [[metabolism]]) for more than a very small fraction of the life of the entire colony. Some clonal colonies may be fully connected via their [[root|root systems]], while most are not actually interconnected, but are genetically identical clones which populated an area through [[vegetative reproduction]]. Ages for clonal colonies, often based on current growth rates, are estimates.&lt;ref name="conifers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conifers.org/topics/oldest.htm|title= How Old Is That Tree?|accessdate= 2006-07-25|author= Gymnosperm Database|date= 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6157">'''Marshall Estus Sehorn''' (June 25, 1934 &amp;ndash; December 5, 2006) was an [[United States|American]] [[A&amp;R]] man, songwriter, music publisher and entrepreneur who played an important role in the development of [[R&amp;B]] and [[popular music]] in [[New Orleans]] between the 1950s and 1970s, particularly as the business partner of [[record producer]] [[Allen Toussaint]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Concord, North Carolina|Concord]], [[North Carolina]], and played guitar in local bands while attending [[North Carolina State University]].  After graduating, he moved to [[New York City]] in 1958, and joined the [[A&amp;R]] staff at [[Bobby Robinson (record producer)|Bobby Robinson]]'s [[Fury Records|Fury]] and [[Fire Records|Fire]] [[record label]]s as their [[Southern United States|Southern]] promotions executive.&lt;ref name=kelly&gt;[http://www.charliegillett.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=3500  Red Kelly, ''Marshall Sehorn'', at CharlieGillett.com]. Retrieved 8 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  He soon discovered singer [[Wilbert Harrison]], whose recording of the [[Leiber and Stoller]] song "[[Kansas City (Leiber and Stoller song)|Kansas City]]" topped the US pop and [[R&amp;B chart]]s in 1959. The following year he secured another [[chart-topper]] for the Fire label, when he signed flamboyant New Orleans singer [[Bobby Marchan]], who had a hit with "[[There's Something on Your Mind]]". He also discovered [[Lee Dorsey]], pairing him with young songwriter and pianist Allen Toussaint, and helped secure hits for [[Gladys Knight and the Pips]] and [[Buster Brown (musician)|Buster Brown]].&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/marshall-sehorn-mn0000358929  Biography by Jason Ankeny at Allmusic.com]. Retrieved 8 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He ran sessions for the Fire and Fury labels in New Orleans, until the labels collapsed in 1963. He was credited as co-writer on many recordings including "[[One Way Out (song)|One Way Out]]", which is usually credited to Sehorn and [[Elmore James]].&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt;

Sehorn remained in New Orleans after the labels folded, and set up his own [[music publisher (popular music)|music publishing]] company, Rhinelander Music.  He persuaded Toussaint to write new material for Lee Dorsey, which included "Ride Your Pony" and "[[Working in the Coal Mine]]", both of which became international hits. With Toussaint, he founded the Sansu record label, and signed singer [[Betty Harris]]. Harris' records for the label, including "Nearer To You", were among the first to feature the label's house band, who became [[The Meters]].&lt;ref name=kelly/&gt; By the late 1960s, Sehorn and Toussaint had become "the most influential music-makers in New Orleans",&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt; and built the '''''Sea-Saint recording studio''''' in [[Gentilly, New Orleans|Gentilly]].  There they recorded such musicians as [[Dr. John]], [[The Neville Brothers]], and [[Labelle]], whose "[[Lady Marmalade]]" was the studio's biggest hit.  The studio also attracted [[Paul McCartney]], whose 1975 [[Wings (band)|Wings]] album ''[[Venus and Mars (Wings album)|Venus and Mars]]'' was largely recorded there.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;

==Legal History==
Marshal Sehorn decided in the 1970s to get out of the actual producing and recording of music, and he entered into the licensing end of the business. He started multiple companies, including Blue Dog Express, Red Dog Express and White Dog Records by which he exploited the rights to music, some of which he did not own.

He attempted to acquire certain rights to the [[Chess Records]] catalogue but [[MCA Records]] exercised a superior claim to the titles in the [[Chess Records]] catalogue, and sued him for infringement in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-16/business/fi-6571_1_la-monte | title=Rights to Rock Treasure Chest at Issue in Trial | date=August 16, 1992 | first=David | last=Williams | work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate=May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In an action brought by MCA, the Los Angeles Superior Court determined that Red Dog and its owner, Marshall Sehorn, never in fact had any rights to the Chess Masters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://openjurist.org/108/f3d/338/mca-records-inc-v-charly-records-ltd | title=108 F. 3d 338 - MCA Records Inc v.

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sehorn lost, and when he could not pay the judgment, he and his companies declared bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="sirshambling.com"&gt;http://www.sirshambling.com/articles/betty_harris/&lt;/ref&gt; The bankruptcy estate started a company called Gulf Coast Music to hold the titles to music in Sehorn's Express company catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;https://casetext.com/case/gulf-coast-music-v-vee-jay-limited-partnership&lt;/ref&gt; Gulf Coast Music then turned over titles of songs to artists like [[Betty Harris]] who had been denied royalties for decades by Sehorn.&lt;ref name="sirshambling.com"/&gt; In bankruptcy, drummer [[Joseph Modeliste]] of [[The Meters]] sought to file a claim for assets of Sehorn's estate, but the [[Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed that Modeliste filed his claims with the bankruptcy court too late.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions%5Cunpub%5C98/98-31065.0.wpd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Sehorn had been sued before over unpaid royalties by artists like [[the Shirelles]] and [[B.J. Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leagle.com/decision/20001010104FSupp2d906_1932/THOMAS%20v.%20LYTLE&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael John Anthony Kealy''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|DSO}} (29 May 1945 – 1 February 1979) was a [[British Army]] officer serving in the [[Special Air Service]], who was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his role in the [[Battle of Mirbat]] in 1972. Kealy was the commander of a nine-member SAS squad, which came under attack from hundreds of [[Popular Front for the Liberation of the Occupied Arabian Gulf|PFLOAG]] guerillas during the [[Dhofar Rebellion]] in [[Oman]].

==Death==
Kealy died of [[hypothermia]] in February 1979 when he joined SAS candidates on a selection march in the [[Brecon Beacons]] in deteriorating weather conditions. He was found alive (but in poor condition) by a two-man search party—one of whom stayed with him and attempted to keep him warm. It was later acknowledged by the coroner that one of the major contributory factors in his death was the delay in retrieving him from the hillside—a delay of some 19 hours due to inclement weather. Another factor was that Kealy had not packed cold weather gear, instead carrying bricks in his Bergen pack to increase its weight to 50 pounds. When offered warm clothing by the search party, he refused—and even threw a warm blanket away. A combination of Kealy's bloody-minded stubbornness and the effects of hypothermia clouding his judgement seems to have been the tipping point.

As a direct result of this and similar incidents, those attempting SAS selection are now allowed to carry only useful items in their bergens when marching.

==In fiction==
Sir [[Ranulph Fiennes]] turns the real Mike Kealy into a fictional character in his book ''[[The Feather Men]]''. In the novel, Mike Kealy is murdered by a group of contract killers called "The Clinic" in revenge for his role in Oman that had resulted in the killing of a sheik's son. Rather than succumbing to the extreme weather conditions while on an endurance march, as actually happened, the fictional character dies after going into diabetic shock following him being injected with insulin by "The Clinic".

==Homochirality==
Many of the essential molecules for life on Earth can exist in two mirror-image forms, referred to as "left-handed" and "right-handed", but living organisms do not use both. [[Protein]]s are exclusively composed of left-handed [[amino acids]]; [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] contain only right-handed [[sugar]]s. This phenomenon is known as [[homochirality]].&lt;ref name=Plaxco&gt;{{cite book |last1=Plaxco |first1= Kevin W. |last2=Michael |first2=Michael |title= Astrobiology: A Brief Introduction |date=2011 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn= 978-1-4214-0194-2 |pages=140-141}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether homochirality emerged before or after life, whether the building blocks of life must have this particular chirality, or indeed whether life needs to be homochiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sedbrook |first1= Danielle |title=Must the Molecules of Life Always be Left-Handed or Right-Handed? |url= https://www.smithsonianmag.com/space/must-all-molecules-life-be-left-handed-or-right-handed-180959956/ |accessdate=8 May 2018 |work= Smithsonian.com |date=28 July 2016 |language= en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protein chains built from amino acids of mixed chirality tend not to fold or function as catalysts, but mirror-image proteins have been constructed that work the same but on substrates of opposite handedness.&lt;ref name=Plaxco/&gt;

==The concept==
It is thought that such mirror organisms can be highly incompatible with existing microbes (viruses, bacteria, protozoa, etc.). Hypothetically, it is possible to recreate an entire ecosystem from the bottom up, in chiral form. In this way, the creation of an Earth ecosystem without microbial diseases might be possible. In some distant future, mirror life could be employed to create robust, effective and disease-free ecosystems for use on other planets.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{Cite journal |url= https://www.wired.com/2010/11/ff_mirrorlife/ |last=Bohannon |first=John |title=Mirror-image cells could transform science - or kill us all |issue=12 |journal=Wired |volume=18 |date=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in [[synthetic biology]], like [[synthetic virology|synthesizing viruses]] since 2002, [[Mycoplasma laboratorium |partially synthetic bacteria]] in 2010, or [[synthetic ribosome]]s in 2013, may lead to the possibility of fully synthesizing a living cell from small molecules, where we could use mirror-image versions ([[enantiomer]]s) of life's building-block molecules, in place of the standard ones. Some proteins have been synthesized in mirror-image versions, including [[polymerase]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=nat1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1= Zimou |last2=Xu |first2=Weiliang |last3=Liu |first3=Lei |last4=Zhu |first4=Ting F. |title= A synthetic molecular system capable of mirror-image genetic replication and transcription |journal=Nature Chemistry |volume= 8 |issue=7 |year=2016 |pages=698–704 |issn=1755-4330 |doi= 10.1038/nchem.2517 |pmid= 27325097 |bibcode= 2016NatCh...8..698W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconstructing regular lifeforms in mirror-image form, using the mirror-image (chiral) reflection of their cellular components, could be achieved by substituting left-handed amino acids with right-handed ones, in order to create mirror reflections of all regular proteins. Analogously, we could get reflected sugars, DNA, etc., on which reflected enzymes would work perfectly. Finally we would get a normally functioning mirror reflection of a natural organism - a chiral counterpart organism - with which natural viruses and bacteria couldn't interact. Electromagnetic force (chemistry) is unchanged under such molecular reflection transformation ([[parity (physics)|P-symmetry]]). There is a small alteration of weak interactions under reflection, which can produce very small corrections, but these corrections are many orders of magnitude lower than thermal noise - almost certainly too tiny to alter any biochemistry.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} However, there are also theories that weak interactions can have a greater effect on longer nucleic acids or protein chains, resulting in much less efficient conversion of mirror ribozymes or enzymes than normal ribozymes or enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pitkänen |first1=M. |title=Could the replication of mirror DNA teach something about chiral … |url=http://tgdtheory.fi/public_html/articles/mirrordna.pdf |website=Topological Geometrodynamics |accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiral animals would need to feed on reflected food, produced by reflected plants. The great advantage, though, is that such chiral organisms should enjoy a disease-free life, completely immune to all viruses and microbes (which virologists are now beginning to understand underlie a huge number of diseases).

Viruses would be completely incompatible with the reflected cellular structures; and bacteria, protozoa, and fungi could not function because they would not be able to find normal sugars inside reflected organisms. The reverse sugars circulating in the chiral organism's body would be indigestible as far as normal bacteria are concerned, so any bacterium entering a chiral organism would simply starve to death. The chiral environment is hostile for normal viruses, protozoa, bacteria, etc.

Mirror life presents potential dangers. For example, a chiral-mirror version of [[cyanobacteria]], which only needs achiral nutrients and light for [[photosynthesis]], could take over Earth's ecosystem due to lack of natural enemies, disturbing the bottom of the food chain by producing mirror versions of the required sugars. Some bacteria can digest [[L-Glucose|L-glucose]]; exceptions like this would give some rare lifeforms an unanticipated advantage.

==Direct applications==
Direct application of mirror-chiral organisms can be mass production of [[enantiomer]]s (mirror-image) of molecules produced by normal life.

*[[Enantiopure drug]]s - some pharmaceuticals have known different activity depending on enantiomeric form,
*[[Aptamer]]s ([[L-Ribonucleic acid aptamer|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-ribonucleic acid aptamers]]): "That makes mirror-image biochemistry a potentially lucrative business. One company that hopes so is [[Noxxon Pharma]] in Berlin. It uses laborious chemical synthesis to make mirror-image forms of short strands of DNA or RNA called aptamers, which bind to therapeutic targets such as proteins in the body to block their activity. The firm has several mirror-aptamer candidates in human trials for diseases including cancer; the idea is that their efficacy might be improved because they aren't degraded by the body's enzymes. A process to replicate mirror-image DNA could offer a much easier route to making the aptamers, says Sven Klussmann, Noxxon Pharma's chief scientific officer."&lt;ref name=polym&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Peplow |first1=Mark |title=Mirror-image enzyme copies looking-glass DNA |journal=Nature |date=16 May 2016 |volume=533 |issue=7603 |pages=303–304 |doi= 10.1038/nature.2016.19918 |pmid=27193657 |bibcode= 2016Natur.533..303P}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[L-Glucose]], enantiomer of standard [[glucose]], for which tests showed that it tastes likes standard sugar, but not being metabolized the same way. However, it was never marketed due to excessive manufacturing costs.&lt;ref name=diab&gt;[https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2004/ch_4.html ''A natural way to stay sweet''], NASA&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research allows cheap production with high yields, however the authors state that it is not usable as a sweetener due to laxative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Martinez |first1=RF |title= Short and sweet: (D)-glucose to (L)-glucose and (L)-glucuronic acid |journal= Angewandte Communications|date= 5 December 2013 |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages= 1160-2 |doi= 10.1002/anie.201309073 |id= Epub 2013 Dec 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==

The creation of one chiral human is the basis of 1950 Arthur C. Clarke's story "[[Technical Error]]", from The Collected Stories. In this story, a physical accident transforms a person into his mirror image, speculatively explained by travel through a fourth physical dimension.

An alien machine that reverses chirality, and a blood-symbiote that functions properly only when in one chirality, were central to Roger Zelazny's 1976 novel [[Doorways in the Sand]].

In the 2017 [[Daniel Suarez (author)|Daniel Suarez]] novel "Change Agent", an antagonist, Otto, nicknamed the "Mirror Man", is revealed to be a genetically-engineered enantiomeric human. He views other humans with disdain and causes them to feel an inexplicable repulsion by his very presence.

'''Mitr Chaibancha''' ([[Thai alphabet|Thai]] มิตร ชัยบัญชา ([http://www.forvo.com/word/Mitr_Chaibancha#th Pronunciation]), January 28, 1934 in [[Phetchaburi]], [[Thailand]] - October 8, 1970&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.535159/qx/details.htm http://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.535159/qx/details.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Thai (ethnic group)|Thai]] [[film actor]] who made 266 films from 1956 to 1970.

He died on October 8, 1970 at Dongtan Beach, [[Pattaya#Jomtien Beach|Jomtien]], [[Pattaya]], after falling from a [[helicopter]] during the filming of a stunt for the final scene of ''[[Insee thong]]'' (''Golden Eagle'').

At the height of his career in the 1960s, Mitr, along with [[Petchara Chaowarat]], made a string of hit films that packed cinemas. Of the 75 to 100 films produced each year by the Thai film industry during this period, Mitr starred in nearly half of them.

==Early life==
Mitr was born into poverty as Pichet Pumhem. His parents separated when he was an infant. At age 8, Mitr and his mother moved to [[Bangkok]], where he was enrolled in a [[Thai boxing]] school. He became the lightweight boxing champion for his school in 1952, and went on to win three lightweight division titles. After finishing secondary school, he studied at Pranakhon College. He was then accepted into the [[Royal Thai Air Force]] aviation school, where he was trained as a pilot. After graduation, he worked as a flight instructor at [[Don Muang Royal Thai Air Force Base]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Mitr-red.jpg|left|thumb|Mitr in character as the masked crime fighter, Insee Daeng, the Red Eagle, one of his most famous roles.]] --&gt;
In 1956 some friends showed his photograph to journalist Kingkaew Kaewprasert, who introduced him to Surat Pukkawet, the editor of a movie magazine. Before long Mitra starred in his first film, ''Chart Sua'' (''Tiger Instinct''). It was then he decided to change his name from Pichet Pumhem to Mitr Chaibancha. He caught the attention of movie fans after starring in ''Chao Nakleng'' (''Gangster Lord''), using the character name Rom Ritthikrai from author Sake Dusit's ''Insee Daeng'' (''Red Eagle'') series of novels.

He married his wife, Jaruwan, in 1959. In 1961 a son, Yuthana, or Ton, was born. However, the marriage ended in a divorce.

==Height of fame==
In 1961 Mitr starred in ''Banthuk Rak Pimchawee'' (''Love Diary of Pimchawee''), his first film with Petchara Chaowarat. This was the beginning of the most celebrated hero-heroine partnerships in Thai cinematic history. The Mitr-Petchara duo made about 165 films together.

One of the pair's most famous films was 1970's ''[[Monrak luk thung]]'' ({{lang-th|มนต์รักลูกทุ่ง}}, or ''Magical Love of the Countryside''), a musical romantic comedy rhapsodizing Thai rural life.

Mitr was an extremely busy actor and was always on the move, going from set to set and sleeping as little as a two or three hours per night.

Another of his best-known movies, ''Pet Tad Pet'' (''Operation Bangkok''), was shot in both Bangkok and [[Hong Kong]], and featured Kecha Plianvitheee and Luecha Naruenart as the villains, as well as Hong Kong's then top actress, Regina Piping.

''Monrak luk thung'' was one of Mitr's last films. It played in Bangkok cinemas for a solid six months in 1970 and took in 6 million [[baht]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaiworldview.com/tv/act.php?myChoice=Mitr%20Chaibancha&amp;mySearch=1 Mitr Chaibancha&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; its popularity spurred by the best-selling soundtrack album and Mitr's accidental death while filming ''[[Insee Thong]]''.

''[[Insee thong]]'' was the first film that Mitr produced himself, and it featured the return of his popular character, the masked crime-fighter, Insee Daeng (Red Eagle), the secret alter ego of alcoholic detective Rom Rittikrai.

On the last day of shooting, the script called for Mitr, having vanquished the villains, to fly off into the sunset in a helicopter. As the camera rolled, Mitr leapt from the ground to grab a rope ladder hanging from the aircraft, only managing to reach the lowest rung. Unaware of this, the helicopter pilot flew higher and higher, and Mitr finally lost his grip and fell to the ground. The accident was all caught on film and was actually left in the final theatrical release. The fatal fall has since been removed from DVD versions of the film, with Mitr simply flying off into the distance and some onscreen text paying tribute to the star.

It was another death that would make 1970 a difficult year for the Thai film industry, as months earlier pioneering director [[Rattana Pestonji]] collapsed while giving a speech urging government officials to support the domestic film industry. He died several hours later.

Mitr’s death was ruled as a tragic accident. For safety, there should have been two takes for the final scene. The first would have been of Mitr grabbing the ladder and flying off at low altitude. Then, a [[stunt double]] would have performed a second shot at a higher altitude.

==Funeral and memorial shrine==
[[Image:Mitr chaibancha23022007 021.jpg|right|thumb|The statue of Mitr Chaibancha in a shrine in Jomtien Beach, Thailand.]]
On the day of his funeral, the streets leading to the [[Buddhist]] temple were packed, with tens of thousands trying to attend his [[cremation]] rites. On the DVD of ''[[Insee thong]]'', release in 2005 in Thailand, one of the special features is footage of the cremation ceremony. Mitr's body is held up so the throngs of onlookers could catch a last glimpse of the dead star. He was survived by his former wife and one son.

A memorial shrine to Mitr is situated on a small street in [[Pattaya#Jomtien Beach|Jomtien]], off Jomtien Road in front of the [[Amphoe Bang Lamung]] Revenue Department, behind Jomtien Palm Beach Hotel. The shrine is open from 6:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. daily. Inside the [[spirit house]] is a statue of Mitr holding a pistol in his right hand, reminiscent of his numerous roles as an action movie star. The walls are lined with photographs and other memorabilia. Fortune seekers visit the shrine, shake [[Kau Cim]] sticks and then check for the corresponding fortune on tablets hung on the shrine. If wishes have been granted, fortune seekers return and purchase a small offering to leave at the shrine.

'''Stephen Lawrence''' (13 September 1974 – 22 April 1993) was a [[black British]] teenager from [[Plumstead]], [[South East (London sub region)|south east London]], who was murdered in a [[Hate crime|racially motivated attack]] while waiting for a bus in [[Well Hall]], [[Eltham]] on the evening of 22 April 1993.&lt;ref name="BBC inquiry" /&gt; The case became a cause célèbre; its fallout included cultural changes of attitudes on racism and the police, and to the law and police practice. It also led to the partial revocation of the rule against [[double jeopardy]]. Two of the perpetrators were convicted of murder in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-26465916 Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline of how the story unfolded]". BBC, 6 March 2014. Retrieved 4 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the initial investigation, five suspects were arrested but not charged.&lt;ref name="BBC detective"&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC News|title=Lawrence detective denies claim|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5232372.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=31 July 2006|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested during the investigation that Lawrence was killed because he was black, and that the handling of the case by the police and [[Crown Prosecution Service]] was affected by issues of race. A 1998 [[public inquiry]],&lt;ref name="Lawrence Inquiry"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir William Macpherson's Inquiry Into The Matters Arising From the Death of Stephen Lawrence|publisher=Official Documents Archive|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/sli-00.htm|date=24 February 1999|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;br /&gt;(see also summary: {{cite news|title=Lawrence: Key recommendations |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/285537.stm|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 March 1999}})&lt;/ref&gt; headed by [[William Macpherson (judge)|Sir William Macpherson]], examined the original [[Metropolitan Police Service]] (MPS) investigation and concluded that the force was [[Institutional racism|institutionally racist]]. It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be repealed in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence: this was effected in 2005 upon enactment of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]]. The publication in 1999 of the resulting Macpherson Report has been called "one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in Britain".&lt;ref name="bbcqna"&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC News|title=Q&amp;A: Stephen Lawrence murder| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3685733.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=5 May 2004|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Straw]], [[Home Secretary]] from 1997 to 2001, commented in 2012 that ordering the inquiry was "the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Justice at last for Stephen Lawrence|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/crime/article3275748.ece|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the case was said to be "one of the highest-profile unsolved racially motivated murders".&lt;ref name="high profile"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawrence murder suspect jailed for dealing|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/lawrence-murder-suspect-jailed-for-dealing-2022528.html|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Independent]] / [[Press Association]]|date=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May 2011, after a further review,&lt;ref name="cold case"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawrence: Killers Face Jail As Parents Speak|url=http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16141887|accessdate=4 January 2012|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was announced that two of the original suspects, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were to stand trial for the murder in the light of new evidence.&lt;ref name="BBC trial"&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC News|title=Stephen Lawrence pair face murder trial|url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13438629|publisher=BBC News|date=18 May 2011|accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time it was disclosed that Dobson's original acquittal had been quashed by the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]], allowing a retrial to take place.&lt;ref name="cps statement May 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint CPS and MPS statement on Stephen Lawrence case|url=http://blog.cps.gov.uk/2011/05/joint-cpsmps-statement-on-stephen-lawrence-case-.html|publisher=[[Crown Prosecution Service]]|accessdate=5 January 2012|date=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an appeal had only become possible following the 2005 change in the law, although Dobson was not the first person to be retried for murder as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/5412264.stm Double jeopardy man is given life], BBC News. 6 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 January 2012, Dobson and Norris were found guilty of Lawrence's murder;&lt;ref name="Dodd Laville 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dodd|first1=Vikram|last2=Laville|first2=Sandra|title=Stephen Lawrence verdict: Dobson and Norris guilty of racist murder|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/03/stephen-lawrence-verdict-guilty-murder?newsfeed=true|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pair were [[Minor (law)|juveniles]] at the time of the crime and were sentenced to [[At Her Majesty's pleasure|detention at Her Majesty's pleasure]], equivalent to a [[life sentence]] for an adult,&lt;ref name="sentencing remarks"&gt;{{cite web|title=R v DOBSON &amp; NORRIS, Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Treacy, 4 January 2012|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/sentencing-remarks-dobson-norris-120104.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with minimum terms of 15 years 2 months and 14 years 3 months respectively&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandra Laville and  Vikram Dodd|title=Stephen Lawrence murder: Norris and Dobson get 14 and 15 years|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/04/dobson-norris-murder-stephen-lawrence|accessdate=4 January 2012|date=4 January 2012|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; for what the judge described as a "terrible and evil crime".&lt;ref name="Richards sentence"&gt;{{cite news|last=Richards|first=David|title=Gary Dobson jailed for minimum of 15 years and 2 months and David Norris to 14 years and 3 months for 'terrible and evil crime'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2082021/How-long-Judge-forced-sentence-killer-pair-juveniles-adults-means-13-years-bars.html|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after Dobson and Norris were sentenced, the case regained prominence when concerns of corrupt police conduct during the original case handling surfaced in the media. Such claims had surfaced before, and been investigated in 2006, but were reignited in 2013 when a former undercover police officer stated in an interview that, at the time, he had been pressured to find ways to "smear" and discredit the victim's family, to mute and deter public campaigning for better police responses to the case. Although further inquiries in 2012 by both [[Scotland Yard]] and the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] had ruled that there was no basis for further investigation, [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] ordered an independent inquiry by a prominent [[Queens Counsel|QC]] into undercover policing and corruption, which was described as "devastating" when published in 2014. An inquiry into whether members of the police force shielded the alleged killers was set up in October 2015.

== Murder ==
Lawrence had spent the day of Thursday 22 April 1993 at Blackheath Bluecoat School.&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe 1999"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sutcliffe|first=Roger|title=The murder of Stephen Lawrence [Archived]|url=http://www.dialogueworks.co.uk/newswise/months/feb99/lasen.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116082756/http://www.dialogueworks.co.uk/newswise/months/feb99/lasen.html|archivedate=2007-11-16|work=February 1999|publisher=Newswise|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After school, he went to [[Lewisham]] to look around shops.  After this, he travelled by [[bus]] to an uncle's house in [[Grove Park, Lewisham|Grove Park]].  He was joined there by [[Duwayne Brooks]], and they played [[video game]]s until leaving at around 10:00 pm.&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry - Appendices - CM 4262-II (Revised)|last=|first=|publisher=The Stationery Office|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After realising that the 286 bus on which they were travelling would get them home late, they decided to change for either bus routes 161 or 122 on [[Well Hall Road]].&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe 1999" /&gt;

Lawrence and Brooks arrived at the bus stop on Well Hall Road at 10:25 pm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He walked along Well Hall Road to the junction of Dickson Road to see if he could see a bus coming and then went back towards the bus stop.&lt;ref name="Macpherson C1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Macpherson|first=William|title=THE MURDER OF STEPHEN LAWRENCE, Chapter 1|publisher=Official Documents Archive|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/sli-01.htm|date=24 February 1999|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks was still on Well Hall Road, part way between Dickson Road and the roundabout with Rochester Way and [[Westhorne Avenue]].&lt;ref name="Macpherson C1" /&gt;

At this point, Brooks saw a group of five or six [[White British|white]] youths crossing over Rochester Way on the opposite side of the street near the area of the [[zebra crossing]] moving towards them.&lt;ref name="Macpherson C1" /&gt; At or just after 10:38&amp;nbsp;pm, he called out to ask whether Lawrence saw the bus coming. Brooks claimed that he heard one of Lawrence's assailants saying: "What, what, [[nigger]]?"&lt;ref name="Macpherson C1" /&gt; as they all quickly crossed the road and "engulfed" Lawrence.

The attackers forced Lawrence down and stabbed him to a depth of about {{convert|5|in|cm|0}} on both sides of the front of his body, in the right [[collarbone]] and left shoulder. Both wounds severed [[axillary artery|axillary arteries]] before penetrating a lung. Lawrence lost all feeling in his right arm and his breathing was constricted, while he was losing blood from four major blood vessels. Brooks began running, and shouted for Lawrence to run to escape with him. While the attackers disappeared down Dickson Road, they both ran in the direction of Shooters Hill, though Lawrence collapsed and bled to death after running {{convert|130|yd|m}}.&lt;ref name="Macpherson C1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/16/stephen-lawrence-murder-trial|title=Stephen Lawrence killed because of 'the colour of his skin'|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 November 2011|first=Sandra|last=Laville|first2=Vikram|last2=Dodd|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cathcart|first=Brian|title=The Case of Stephen Lawrence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Inr4-HJGhrAC&amp;pg=PT25|accessdate=25 July 2014|date=7 March 2012|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-241-96324-1|pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initial investigations, arrests and prosecutions ===
Within three days of the crime, prime suspects had been identified. No arrests were made, however, until over two weeks after the killing. Detective Superintendent Brian Weeden, the officer who had been leading the murder investigation from its third day, and who would ultimately lead the [[murder squad]] for 14 months, explained to an incredulous public inquiry in 1998 that part of the reason no arrests had taken place by the fourth day after the killing (Monday 26 April) was that he had not known the law allowed arrest upon [[reasonable suspicion]] – a basic point of criminal law.&lt;ref name="Guardian-1998"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pallister|first=David|title=Police bungling that betrayed Stephen Lawrence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1998/jul/18/lawrence.ukcrime|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=18 July 1998}} – stated in the text to be "now, on the 49th day of the inquiry".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC timeline"/&gt;

On 7 May 1993, the Acourt brothers and Dobson were arrested. Norris turned himself in to police and was likewise arrested three days later.  Knight was arrested on 3 June. Neil Acourt, picked out at an [[identity parade]], and Luke Knight were charged with murder on 13 May and 23 June 1993 respectively, but the charges were dropped on 29 July 1993, the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] citing insufficient evidence.&lt;ref name="BBC OTD"&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC News|title=1997: Lawrence 'killed by racists'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/14/newsid_2723000/2723721.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=14 February 1997|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An internal review was opened in August 1993 by the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]]. On 16 April 1994, the Crown Prosecution Service stated they did not have sufficient evidence for murder charges against anyone else, despite a belief by the Lawrence family that new evidence had been found.&lt;ref name="Guardian-1998" /&gt;

=== Private prosecution ===
In April 1994,&lt;ref name="BBC timeline"&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC News|title=Stephen Lawrence – timeline of events|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/stephen_lawrence/timeline.htm|publisher=BBC News|date=2 December 1999|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence's family initiated a [[private prosecution]] against the initial two suspects and three others: Jamie Acourt, Gary Dobson and David Norris. The family were not entitled to [[legal aid]] and a fighting fund was established to pay for the analysis of [[Forensic science|forensic evidence]] and the cost of tracing and re-interviewing witnesses. The family were represented by counsel [[Michael Mansfield]] QC, Martin Soorjoo and Margo Boye who worked ''[[pro bono]]''.&lt;ref name="Lawyer funds"&gt;{{cite news|author="The Lawyer"|title=Funds pour in for Lawrence action|url=http://www.thelawyer.com/funds-pour-in-for-lawrence-action/84152.article|publisher=[[The Lawyer]]|date=5 February 1995|accessdate=10 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges against Jamie Acourt and David Norris were dropped before the trial for lack of evidence. On 23 April 1996, the three remaining suspects were acquitted of murder by a jury at the Central Criminal Court, after the trial judge, the Honourable Mr Justice Curtis, ruled that the identification evidence given by Duwayne Brooks was unreliable.&lt;ref name="bbcqna"/&gt; The Macpherson report endorsed the judgement, stating that "Mr Justice Curtis could [have] properly reach[ed] only one conclusion" and that "[t]here simply was no satisfactory evidence available".&lt;ref name="Lawrence Inquiry" /&gt;

=== Subsequent events (1994–2010) ===
[[File:Murderers_(Daily_Mail,_1997).jpg|thumb|After the February 1997 inquest returned a verdict of unlawful killing, the front page of the ''Daily Mail'' labelled all five suspects "murderers" and instructed them to sue if the assumption was wrong. Lawrence's parents and numerous political figures praised the ''Daily Mail'' for taking the potential financial risk of this front page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Carroll|first1=Lisa|title=Stephen Lawrence's parents thank Daily Mail for 'going out on a limb'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/04/stephen-lawrence-parents-daily-mail|accessdate=28 September 2017|work=The Guardian|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An inquest into the death of Lawrence was held in February 1997. The five suspects refused to answer any questions, claiming privilege against self-incrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/wall-of-silence-from-white-youths-at-lawrence-inquest-1278182.html |title=Wall of silence from white youths at Lawrence inquest |publisher=The Independent |date=12 February 1997 |accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inquest concluded on 13 February 1997, with the jury returning a verdict after 30 minutes' deliberation of unlawful killing "in a completely unprovoked racist attack by five white youths"; this finding went beyond the bounds of their instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Ailsen Daniels, Duncan Campbell, "'Unlawfully killed in an unprovoked racist attack by five white youths'", ''The Guardian'', 14 February 1997, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 February 1997, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper labelled all five suspects "murderers". The headline read, "Murderers: The Mail accuses these men of killing. If we are wrong, let them sue us." Underneath this headline appeared pictures of the five suspects: Dobson, Neil and Jamie Acourt, Knight, and Norris.&lt;ref name="Wright victory"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Stephen|title=The Mail's victory: How Stephen Lawrence's killers were finally brought to justice years after our front page sensationally branded the evil pair murderers|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2080159/Stephen-Lawrence-case-How-killers-finally-brought-justice.html|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="British Library"&gt;{{cite web|author=British Library|title=Stephen Lawrence murder|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/features/frontpage/lawrence.html|publisher=[[British Library]]|year=1997|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the men ever sued for [[defamation]] and strong public opinions rose against the accused and the police who handled the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Adam|title=This Daily Mail Headline May Have Been Crucial in Putting Racist Murderers Behind Bars|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/stephen-lawrence-daily-mail-paul-dacre-2012-1|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=[[Business Insider]]|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1997 an inquiry was ordered by the [[Home Secretary]] to identify matters related to the killing, known as the Macpherson Report, which was completed in February 1999  ''([[#The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry (published as "The Macpherson report")|see below]])''. In 2002, David Norris and Neil Acourt were convicted and jailed for racially aggravated harassment after an incident involving a plain-clothes black police officer.&lt;ref name="BBC Norris Acourt jailed"&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC News|title=Lawrence pair jailed for race attack|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2240697.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=6 September 2002|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the law was changed. As part of the findings on the Lawrence case, the Macpherson Report had recommended that the rule against [[double jeopardy]] (the [[common law]] rule that once acquitted an accused person could not be tried a second time for the same crime) should be [[repeal]]ed in murder cases, and that it should be possible to subject an acquitted murder suspect to a second trial if "fresh and viable" new evidence later came to light. The [[Law Commission]] later added its support to this in its report "Double Jeopardy and Prosecution Appeals" (2001). A parallel report into the [[criminal justice system]] by [[Robin Auld|Lord Justice Auld]], a former senior presiding judge for England and Wales, had also commenced in 1999 and was published as the Auld Report 6 months after the Law Commission report. It opined that the Law Commission had been unduly cautious by limiting the scope to murder and that "the exceptions should [...] extend to other grave offences punishable with life and/or long terms of imprisonment as Parliament might specify."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Review of the Criminal Courts of England and Wales by The Right Honourable Lord Justice Auld|url=http://www.criminal-courts-review.org.uk/|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20090607141016/http://www.criminal-courts-review.org.uk/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-06-07|accessdate=5 January 2012|date=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These recommendations were implemented within the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2003/30044--k.htm Criminal Justice Act 2003 (c. 44)]. Opsi.gov.uk (23 December 2011).

Between the Lawrence murder and early 2010, Dobson was arrested or charged a number of times for offences such as theft and burglary. Some of these charges were dropped, at least one resulted in a small fine. None led to imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Mail drugs"&gt;{{cite news |author= Daily Mail |title=Justice at last: Thug accused of murdering Stephen Lawrence gets five years for drug dealing|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1293203/Stephen-Lawrence-murderer-Gary-Dobson-jailed-gets-years-drug-dealing.html|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 July 2006, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' repeated its now famous "Murderers" front page. In July 2010, Gary Dobson was jailed for five years for [[drug dealing|possessing and supplying]] 49&amp;nbsp;kg of [[Drugs controlled by the UK Misuse of Drugs Act#Class B drugs|class B drugs]] with a street value of around £350,000&lt;ref name="Mail drugs" /&gt; (approximately US$550,000&lt;ref&gt;GBP:USD exchange rate on 23 February 2010, the time of the attempted drug deal: £1 = [http://www.xe.com/currencytables/?from=GBP&amp;date=2012-02-02 $1.5812], therefore £350,000 = approx. US$550,000&lt;/ref&gt;). At the time of Dobson's sentencing for drug dealing, ''[[The Independent]]'' described the Lawrence killing – despite it having happened more than 17 years previously – as "one of the highest-profile unsolved racially motivated murders".&lt;ref name="high profile" /&gt;

=== Cold case review and new evidence ===

In June 2006, a [[Cold case|cold case review]] commenced, involving a full re-examination of the forensic evidence.&lt;ref name="cold case" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC trial" /&gt; Initially this was held in secrecy and not publicised;&lt;ref name="Guardian forensics"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dodd|first1=Vikram|last2=Hodgson|first2=Martin|title=Lawrence murder: new forensic clue|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lawrence/Story/0,,2207231,00.html|publisher=[[Guardian Online]]|date=8 September 2007|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, in November 2007, police confirmed they were investigating new scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="Guardian forensics" /&gt;

The most important of the new evidence comprised:&lt;ref name="chan4 evidence"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawrence murder trial: the forensic evidence|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/lawrence-murder-trial-the-forensic-evidence|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=Channel 4 News|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc evidence"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Lawrence murder: Dobson and Norris found guilty|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16257377|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A microscopic (0.5 x 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm) stain of Lawrence's blood in Dobson's jacket.&lt;ref name="new evidence"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Lawrence murder: Tiny forensic evidence proved key|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/886302-stephen-lawrence-murder-tiny-forensic-evidence-proved-key|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=Metro|date=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had dried into the fibres and its tiny size implied this had happened very quickly. The forensic analysis concluded it had not been transferred there from elsewhere as dried blood or later soaked into the fabric, but was deposited fresh, and would have dried almost immediately after being deposited due to its microscopic size.
* Fibres from Lawrence's clothing, and hairs with a 99.9% chance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Lawrence murder: Dobson and Norris found guilty|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16257377|accessdate=5 January 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=3 January 2012|quote=A geneticist examined MtDNA databases and told the court the chance of it not coming from Stephen was one in 1,000}}&lt;/ref&gt; of coming from Lawrence, found on the two men's clothes from the time or in the evidence bag holding them.&lt;ref name="new evidence" /&gt; (The defence later argued unsuccessfully at trial that these were present due to contamination or lack of care of evidence&lt;ref name="chan4 evidence" /&gt;).

The police unit manager involved in the matter commented that the new evidence was only found because of scientific developments and developments in forensic approaches that had taken place since 1996 which allowed microscopic blood stains and hair fragments to be [[DNA analysis|analysed for DNA]] and other microscopic evidence to be found and used forensically.&lt;ref name="new evidence" /&gt;

=== 2011–2012 trial ===
Gary Dobson and David Norris were arrested and charged without publicity on 8 September 2010&lt;ref name="BBC trial" /&gt; and on 23 October 2010 the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]], [[Keir Starmer]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], applied to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales#Criminal Division|Court of Appeal]]  for Dobson's original acquittal to be quashed.&lt;ref name="cps statement May 2011" /&gt; Dobson was in prison at the time for [[drug dealing]].&lt;ref name="Mail drugs" /&gt; Norris had not been previously acquitted, so no application was necessary in his case. For legal reasons – to protect the investigation and ensure a fair hearing – [[Publication ban|reporting restriction]]s were put in place at the commencement of these proceedings; the arrests and subsequent developments were not publicly reported at the time.&lt;ref name="cps statement May 2011" /&gt;

Dobson's acquittal was quashed following a two-day hearing on 11 and 12 April 2011, enabling his retrial.&lt;ref name="quash ruling"&gt;{{cite web|title=R. v. Dobson, &lt;nowiki&gt;[2011]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWCA Crim 1256|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2011/1256.html|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 May 2011, the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment and the reporting restrictions were partially lifted.&lt;ref name="cps statement May 2011" /&gt; It was announced by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] that the two would face trial for Lawrence's murder in light of "new and substantial evidence".&lt;ref name="BBC trial" /&gt; The judgment of the court stated that "[i]f reliable, the new scientific evidence would place Dobson in very close proximity indeed to Stephen Lawrence at the moment of and in the immediate aftermath of the attack, proximity, moreover, for which no innocent explanation can be discerned".&lt;ref name="quash ruling" /&gt; The ruling also emphasised that this was to be "a new trial of a defendant who, we repeat, is presumed in law to be innocent," and suggested a cautious and fact-based reporting style to avoid [[contempt of court]] or risk of prejudice to the future trial.&lt;ref name="quash ruling" /&gt;

The judge stated that the sentences reflected the fact that Dobson and Norris were [[minor (law)|juveniles]] (Dobson 17, and Norris 16&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8991251/Stephen-Lawrence-murder-Gary-Dobson-and-David-Norris-face-reduced-sentences.html|title=Stephen Lawrence murder: Gary Dobson and David Norris face reduced sentences|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first1=Mark|last1=Hughes|first2=Martin|last2=Evans|first3=Victoria|last3=Ward|date=4 January 2012|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) at the time of the offence, which took place before the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]]; the starting point for the minimum term was therefore 12 years.

=== Immediate aftermath of trial ===
Following the 2012 convictions, [[Paul Dacre]], ''Daily Mail'' [[newspaper editor|editor]] since 1992, issued a comment on his 1997 headline decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title=Stephen Lawrence front page 'was a monumental risk' says Daily Mail editor|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/03/stephen-lawrence-daily-mail-paul-dacre|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dacre|first=Paul|title=Paul Dacre, Daily Mail Editor, on the risks he and the Mail ran to secure justice for Stephen Lawrence: Paul Dacre's Statement in full|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2081736/Stephen-Lawrence-trial-verdict-Paul-Dacre-Daily-Mail-editor-shares-views.html|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that if it hadn't been for the ''Mail''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s headline in 1997 —'Murderers: The Mail accuses these men of killing'—and our years of campaigning, none of this would have happened. Britain's police might not have undergone the huge internal reform that was so necessary. Race relations might not have taken the significant step forward that they have.  And an 18-year-old A-Level student who dreamed of being an architect would have been denied justice. The ''Daily Mail'' took a monumental risk with that headline. In many ways, it was an outrageous, unprecedented step.}}

Others have argued that, in writing the above, Dacre was overselling his involvement in what had finally been achieved. For instance, an article in the February 2012 edition of the ''[[Socialist Review]]'' stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Brian|title=It wasn't the Daily Mail wot won it! |url=http://socialistreview.org.uk/366/it-wasnt-daily-mail-wot-won-it|accessdate=26 April 2018|newspaper=[[Socialist Review]]|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is ... disingenuous of Dacre to claim that the Stephen Lawrence Family Campaign would have petered out if his paper had not ridden heroically to its rescue. The "Murderers" story appeared in February 1997, almost four years after Stephen was killed. For much of the intervening period the mainstream press, including the Daily Mail, were openly hostile and suspicious of a family that so vocally criticised the police.}}

===Appeals===
On 5 January 2012, it was reported that the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] was reviewing the minimum terms at the request of a member of the public, to determine whether he believed them to be "unduly lenient", and if so whether to apply to the Court of Appeal for an increase in the minimum terms.&lt;ref name="leniency"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16430633 |title=Stephen Lawrence: Attorney General to review sentences |publisher=BBC News |date=5 January 2012|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile minimum life sentences in a 2000 review (i.e. before the 2003 act passed into law) varied from a "most common" minimum of 10 years to a maximum of 20, placing Dobson and Norris in the middle of that range.&lt;ref name="leniency" /&gt; On 1 February 2012, the Attorney General announced that he would not be referring the sentences to the Court of Appeal, as he believed that "the minimum terms [were] ... within the appropriate range of sentences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16840950|title=Stephen Lawrence killers' sentences will not be reviewed|date=1 February 2012|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2012, it emerged that Norris and Dobson were seeking leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal against their convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Stephen|last=Wright|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2093955/Stephen-Lawrence-Norris-Dobson-appeal-conviction.html|title=Murderers pile on agony for the Lawrence parents: Norris and Dobson will use legal aid to appeal against convictions|publisher=The Daily Mail|date=30 January 2012|accessdate=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August 2012, it was reported that Norris and Dobson had lost the first round of their appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19352974|title=Lawrence murder pair lose appeal|date=23 August 2012|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2013, it was announced that Gary Dobson had dropped his appeal against his murder conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9933116/Gary-Dobson-drops-Stephen-Lawrence-murder-appeal.html|title=Gary Dobson drops Stephen Lawrence murder appeal|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=15 March 2013|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other inquiries and investigations ==

=== The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry (published as "The Macpherson report") ===
On 31 July 1997, the [[Home Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] ordered a [[public inquiry]], to be conducted by [[William Macpherson (judge)|Sir William Macpherson]] and officially titled "The Inquiry Into The Matters Arising From The Death of Stephen Lawrence".&lt;ref name="inquiry letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/sli-pre.htm|title=The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken "more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/sli-02.htm|title=The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded that the original Metropolitan Police Service investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including: failing to give [[first aid]] when they reached the scene; failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation; and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 [[Scarman Report]], compiled following [[1981 England riots|race-related riots]] in [[Brixton]] and [[Toxteth]], had been ignored.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Inquiry" /&gt;

Detective Superintendent Brian Weeden said during the inquiry that mistakes had been made in the murder investigation, including his own ignorance that he could have arrested the suspects four days after the killing simply on [[reasonable suspicion]], a basic point of criminal law.&lt;ref name="Guardian-1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC timeline"/&gt;

The report also found that the Metropolitan Police was [[institutional racism|institutionally racist]].  A total of 70 recommendations for reform, covering both policing and criminal law, were made. These proposals included abolishing the [[double jeopardy]] rule and criminalising racist statements made in private. Macpherson also called for reform in the [[British Civil Service]], local governments, the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]], schools, and the judicial system, to address issues of institutional racism.&lt;ref name="Holdaway O'Neill 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holdaway|first1=Simon|last2=O'Neill|first2=Megan|title=Institutional Racism after Macpherson: An Analysis of Police Views|journal=Policing and Society|volume=16|issue=4|pages=349–369|year=2006|doi=10.1080/10439460600967885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report was criticised at the time by [[Michael Gove]] (later [[Secretary of State for Education]] and [[Lord Chancellor]]) in ''[[The Times]]'', who said, "The tendentious reasoning and illiberal recommendations of that document have been brilliantly anatomised by the ethical socialists [[Norman Dennis]] and George Erdos and the Kurdish academic Ahmed al-Shahi in the [[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]] pamphlet ''Racist Murder and Pressure Group Politics''."{{Clarify|A summary of the key points made in that pamphlet would be appropriate, please|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref name="Gove 2000"&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Gove|authorlink=Michael Gove|title=Be politically astute, not politically correct|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/be-politically-astute-not-politically-correct-gqpt762l75m|work=The Times |location=UK|date=10 October 2000|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public complaints about mishandling of case===
In 1997, Lawrence's family registered a formal complaint with the [[Police Complaints Authority (United Kingdom)|Police Complaints Authority]] (PCA), which in 1999 exonerated the officers who had worked on the case of allegations of racism.  Only one officer, Detective Inspector Ben Bullock, was ordered to face disciplinary charges for neglect of duty. Bullock, who was second in command of the investigation, was later found guilty of failure to properly brief officers and failure to fully investigate an anonymous letter sent to police, but he was acquitted of 11 other charges. Four other officers who would have been charged as a result of the inquiry retired before it concluded.

Bullock retired the day after his punishment was announced, so that it amounted to a mere caution. Neville Lawrence, Stephen's father, criticised the punishment, saying that Bullock was "guilty on all counts." However, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Federation stated that Bullock had been "largely vindicated" in the proceedings.&lt;ref name="BBC whitewash"&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC News|title=Lawrence hearing a "whitewash"|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/393790.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=13 July 1999|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March 2006, the Metropolitan Police Service announced that it would pay Duwayne Brooks £100,000 as compensation for the manner in which police had handled his complaints about their actions toward him after the murder.&lt;ref name="BBC sue"&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC News|title=Lawrence friend sues police|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/428210.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=23 August 1999|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC payout"&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC News|title=Police payout for Lawrence friend|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4793426.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=10 March 2006|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=January 2012}}

=== Concerns and inquiries of alleged police corruption and undercover officer conduct ===

==== Investigation into police corruption (2006) ====
On 25 July 2006, the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) announced that it had asked the Metropolitan Police to look into alleged claims of police corruption that may have helped hide the killers of Lawrence.

A [[BBC]] investigation alleged that the murder inquiry's Det. Sgt. John Davidson had taken money from known drug smuggler Clifford Norris, the father of David Norris, a chief suspect in the investigation.&lt;ref name="BBC corruption"&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC News|title=Lawrence case 'corruption' probe|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5214644.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=26 July 2006|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Putnam, a former corrupt police detective turned [[whistleblower]], told a BBC investigation that Clifford Norris was paying Davidson to obstruct the case and to protect the suspects. "Davidson told me that he was looking after Norris and that to me meant that he was protecting him, protecting his family against arrest and any conviction," Putnam said.&lt;ref name="BBC corruption"/&gt; Davidson denied any such corruption.

The [[Metropolitan Police Service]] announced that it was to open up a special incident room to field calls from the public, following the BBC documentary ''The Boys Who Killed Stephen Lawrence''. The [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] later stated that the claims made in the programme were unfounded.&lt;ref name="BBC nocorruption"&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC News|title='No corruption' in Lawrence case|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7043064.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=13 November 2007|accessdate=4 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 2009, Independent Police Complaints Commission investigators and officers from the Metropolitan Police's directorate of professional standards arrested a former police constable and a serving member of Metropolitan Police staff on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice by allegedly withholding evidence from the original murder inquiry, the Kent investigation and the Macpherson inquiry. Dr Richard Stone, who sat on the Macpherson inquiry, commented that the panel had felt that there was "a large amount of information that the police were either not processing or were suppressing" and "a strong smell of corruption". Baroness Ros Howells, patron of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, agreed: "Lots of people said they gave the police evidence which was never produced."&lt;ref name="Laville withheld"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laville|first1=Sandra|last2=Muir|first2=Hugh|title=Stephen Lawrence case pair arrested over evidence 'withheld' since murder|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/18/stephen-lawrence-case-evidence-withheld|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=18 December 2009|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 March 2010 the IPCC announced that "No further action will be taken against the two men arrested following concerns identified by the internal Metropolitan police service (MPS) review of the murder of Stephen Lawrence" and the two were released from [[bail]].&lt;ref name="Davies hidden evidence"&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Caroline|title=No action over 'hidden evidence' claims in Stephen Lawrence murder case|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/mar/01/stephen-lawrence-hidden-evidence-claim|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=1 March 2010|accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Revelations about undercover police conduct (2013)====
On 23 June 2013, an interview with Peter Francis, a former under-cover police officer, was published in ''[[The Guardian]]''. In the interview Francis disclosed that while he was working undercover within an anti-racist campaign group in the mid-1990s, he was constantly pressured by superiors to "smear" the credibilities of the family of Lawrence so as to put an end to campaigns for a better investigation into Lawrence's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Lawrence family and friends targeted by police 'smear' campaign|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/23/stephen-lawrence-undercover-police-smears|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 June 2013|first=Rob|last=Evans|first2=Paul|last2=Lewis|authorlink2=Paul Lewis (journalist)|accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the revelation, [[Theresa May]], the UK's home secretary pledged to be "ruthless about purging corruption from the police", and Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] ordered Police to investigate the allegations, saying of them that he was "deeply worried about the reports".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mason|first=Rowena|title=Home Secretary pledges to 'purge corruption' from police after Stephen Lawrence family smear allegations|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10139347/Home-Secretary-pledges-to-purge-corruption-from-police-after-Stephen-Lawrence-family-smear-allegations.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Constable]] Mick Creedon, who is leading [[Operation Herne]], an ongoing inquiry into [[Metropolitan police]] [[undercover operation]]s against [[protest group]]s, said he would investigate the allegations as part of the inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/24/undercover-officers-police-chief-met|title=Dozens of undercover officers could face prosecution, says police chief|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 June 2013|first=Paul|last=Lewis | authorlink = Paul Lewis (journalist)|first2=Rob|last2=Evans|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015 an inquiry was set up by the [[National Crime Agency]] to investigate allegations that members of the police force shielded the alleged killers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/16/stephen-lawrence-inquiry-hunts-police-alleged-to-have-shielded-killers|title=Stephen Lawrence: new criminal inquiry into claims police shielded killers|work=The Guardian|date=16 October 2015|first=Vikram|last=Dodd|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Stephen Lawrence Independent Review (2014)====
Following the 2012 convictions, further inquiries by both [[Scotland Yard]] and the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] ruled that there was no new evidence to warrant further investigation. After discussions with Doreen Lawrence, [[Home Secretary]] Theresa May commissioned [[Mark Ellison]] QC to review Scotland Yard's investigations into alleged police corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/lawrence-murder-police-corruption-will-be-investigated-7811117.html|title=May defies Met to order inquiry after Independent campaign|author=Andrew Grice &amp; Paul Peachey|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=2 June 2012|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Hogan-Howe|Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe]], [[Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police]] said the report, which prompted an inquiry into undercover policing, was "devastating".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26485664|title=Hogan-Howe vows to restore trust in Met after new Lawrence row|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=7 March 2014|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellison's report also showed that there was substantial evidence linking an alleged corrupt police officer with involvement in the murder of [[private investigator]] [[Daniel Morgan (private investigator)|Daniel Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-26491279|title=Daniel Morgan murder case 'corruption link' with Lawrence investigation|publisher=[[BBC Wales]]|date=7 March 2014|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy and recognition ==
An annual architectural award, the Stephen Lawrence Prize, was established by the Marco Goldschmied Foundation in association with the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] in Lawrence's memory.

His mother, Doreen Lawrence, said, "I would like Stephen to be remembered as a young man who had a future. He was well loved, and had he been given the chance to survive maybe he would have been the one to bridge the gap between black and white because he didn't distinguish between black or white. He saw people as people."&lt;ref name="BBC Guilty" /&gt;

In 1995 a memorial plaque was set into the pavement at the spot where he was killed on Well Hall Road. The plaque has been vandalised several times since then.&lt;ref name="Plaque vandalism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Smashed glass bottle on Stephen Lawrence plaque in Eltham |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15153119|publisher=BBC|date=3 October 2011|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Nicolas Kent]] designed a documentary play based on the trial, called ''The Colour of Justice''. It was staged at the [[Tricycle Theatre]] and was later filmed by the BBC.&lt;ref name="IMDB CoJ"&gt;{{cite web|author=IMDB|title=The Colour of Justice|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190313/|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also performed at the [[Guildford School of Acting]] for the 20th anniversary of the murder.

On 7 February 2008, the Stephen Lawrence Centre, designed by architect [[David Adjaye]], opened in [[Deptford]], south-east London.&lt;ref name="BBC building"&gt;{{cite news|author=BBC News|title=Stephen Lawrence building opens|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7230503.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=7 February 2008|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, it was vandalised in an attack that was initially believed to be racially motivated. However, doubt was cast on that assumption when CCTV evidence appeared to show one of the suspects to be [[Mixed (United Kingdom ethnicity category)|mixed-race]].&lt;ref name="London vandalism"&gt;{{cite web|author=This Is Local London|title=Lawrence centre vandalism suspects |url=http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/search/display.var.2048400.0.lawrence_centre_vandalism_suspects/|publisher=thisislocallondon|date=15 February 2008|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust is a national educational charity committed to the advancement of [[social justice]]. The Trust provides educational and employability workshops and mentoring schemes. It also awards architectural and landscape bursaries.&lt;ref name="Lawrence Trust"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Lawrence trust|title=The Trust|url=http://www.stephenlawrence.org.uk/the-trust/|publisher=Stephen Lawrence Trust|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the Trust, with architects [[RMJM]], created the initiative [[Architecture for Everyone]] to help promote architecture and the [[creative industries]] to young people from ethnic minorities.&lt;ref name="Styart 2008"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stuart|first=Dan|title=Gordon Brown lends support to architecture campaign|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/gordon-brown-lends-support-to-architecture-campaign/3129538.article|newspaper=Building Design|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Doreen Lawrence received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the [[14th Pride of Britain Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/london/2012-10-30/doreen-lawrence-honoured/|title=Doreen Lawrence honoured|publisher=[[ITV News]]|date=30 October 2012|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doreen Lawrence was elevated to the [[peerage]] as a [[Baroness]] on 6 September 2013, and is formally styled ''Baroness Lawrence of Clarendon, of [[Clarendon Parish, Jamaica|Clarendon]] in the [[Commonwealth Realm]] of [[Jamaica]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=60624 |date=11 September 2013 |page=17949}}&lt;/ref&gt; the honour is rare for being [[territorial designation|designated]] after a location in a Commonwealth realm outside the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Siva, Vivienne|url=http://jis.gov.jm/jamaican-born-civil-rights-campaigner-appointed-british-house-lords/|title=Jamaican Born Civil Rights Campaigner Appointed to British House of Lords|date=25 October 2013|publisher=Jamaican Information Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sits on the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] benches in the House of Lords as a working peer specialising in race and diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/working-peerages-announced "Working peerages announced"], Gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 2018, at a memorial service to mark the 25th anniversary of his death, Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] announced that "Stephen Lawrence Day" would be an annual national commemoration of his death on 22 April every year starting in 2019. Stephen's mother Doreen Lawrence made a statement that Stephen Lawrence Day would be "an opportunity for young people to use their voices and should be embedded in our education and wider system regardless of the government of the day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43869377|title=Stephen Lawrence Day to be held annually|publisher=BBC News|date=23 April 2018|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Stephen Lawrence Day to be created in tribute to murdered teenager | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/23/prince-harry-and-meghan-attend-stephen-lawrence-memorial-service | work= The Guardian | date = 23 April 2018 | accessdate = 23 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
''Daily Mail'' journalist [[Stephen Wright (journalist)|Stephen Wright]] has written about the Lawrence case, both before and subsequent to the prosecution. He was awarded a Special Campaign Award as part of the 2012 [[Paul Foot Award]] for his work in the Lawrence case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.private-eye.co.uk/paul_foot.php |title=The Paul Foot Award|publisher=[[Private Eye]]|date= |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novelist [[Deborah Crombie]] uses the turmoil following the Stephen Lawrence murder as a flashback setting in her 2017 book, ''The Garden of Lamentations''. The story includes police officers who were undercover on both sides of the protests, as well as widespread corruption for years afterward. Crombie includes an explanation of the murder in her Author's Note at the end of the book, but specifies that the rest of the characters are not meant to represent actual people.

The '''National Coronial Information System (NCIS)''' is a national database of coronial information on every death reported a [[Coroner]] in Australia from July 2000 (Queensland from July 2001) and New Zealand from July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncis.org.au/|title=National Coronial Information System|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It assists coroners, their staff, public sector agencies, researchers and other agencies in obtaining coronial data to inform death and injury prevention activities.

== History ==
The NCIS was the first national database for coronial information in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Bianca|last2=Little|first2=Dianne|last3=McDougall|first3=James|last4=Langlois|first4=Neil El|date=2015|title=The Coronial System and Determining Manner of Death in Australia -An Overview|journal=Academic Forensic Pathology|language=|volume=5|issue=3|pages=436–442|doi=10.23907/2015.047|issn=1925-3621}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was established in Australia following recognition by coroners that their mandate for public health and safety could be improved if they could share coronial data across borders to identify previous similar deaths&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saar|first=Eva|last2=Bugeja|first2=Lyndal|last3=Ranson|first3=David L.|date=2017|title=National Coronial Information System: epidemiology and the coroner in Australia|journal=Academic Forensic Pathology|volume=7|issue=4|pages=582–90|doi=10.23907/2017.049}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Prior to the establishment of the NCIS there was no systematic national data storage system for Australia’s eight coronial jurisdictions and the NCIS is considered an invaluable tool to facilitate public health knowledge and research, hence strengthening the coroner's role&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lightfoot|first=J|last2=Owens|first2=L|date=2000|title=The National Coroners Information System:  a new death and injury surveillance tool|url=https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=433446845212403;res=IELHEA|journal=Australasian Epidemiologist|language=|volume=7|issue=1|pages=24–30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1997, the Australian Coroners' Society endorsed a business plan for the development and management of the NCIS by a consortium called the Monash University National Centre for Coronial Information (MUNCCI). The consortium was made up of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine (a statutory agency of the [[Department of Justice and Regulation|Victorian Department of Justice and Regulation]], which also hosts the Department of Forensic Medicine at [[Monash University]]), Monash University’s Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, and the [[Monash University Accident Research Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;AIHW, Driscoll T, Henley G, Harrison J, (2004).[https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/injury/national-coroners-information-system-tool/contents/table-of-contents The National Coroners Information System as an information tool for injury surveillance]. Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The NCIS was launched in 2000, as the National Coroners information System, with the objective to securely share case information beyond state and territory borders for the purpose of coronial investigation and death prevention&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Parliament of Victoria Law Reform Committee (September 2006) ''[https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/images/stories/committees/lawrefrom/coroners_act/final_report.pdf Coroners Act 1985: Parliamentary Paper No 229 of Session 2003-06]'', Melbourne: Victorian Government Printer.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The NCIS was managed by MUNCCI until 2004. The [http://www.vifm.org/ Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine] subsequently managed the system from 2004-2012. Since 2012, the NCIS has been part of the Victorian Department of Justice and Regulation through the Service, Strategy and Reform Division&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pearse|first=J|date=2012|title=The National Coronial Information System: A decade of challenges and achievements|url=https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/18/Suppl_1/A22.1|journal=Injury Prevention|volume=18|pages=A22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data ==
The NCIS collects demographic, contextual and circumstantial information on every reportable death in Australia and New Zealand, as well as legal, medical and scientific reports such as the coroner's finding, post mortem report, toxicology report and police summary of death reports&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncis.org.au/about-the-data/explanatory-notes/|title=Data Explanatory Notes|last=|first=|date=|website=National Coronial information System|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Supplementary data is provided by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics|Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)]] and the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|New Zealand Ministry of Health]]. All deaths occurring in Australia and New Zealand are coded in accordance with the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation (WHO)]] International Classification of Death – Tenth Revision [[ICD-10|(ICD-10)]] codes.

== Services ==
The NCIS provides information to agencies responsible for developing community health and safety strategies to reduce the incidence of preventable death and injury in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The NCIS database is available by application only to approved users, including death investigators (coroners, coronial death investigators, forensic pathologists and police assisting a coroner) and ethically approved third party researchers. Access for Australian and New Zealand death investigators provides them with the ability to review previous coronial cases across jurisdictions that may be similar in nature to current investigations, thus ensuring their ability to identify systemic hazards within the community. Access for approved researchers and government agencies enables them to identify the frequency and circumstances surrounding particular types of death for the purposes of research and prevention&lt;ref&gt;Queensland Ombudsman (2006).[https://www.ombudsman.qld.gov.au/improve-public-administration/reports-and-case-studies/investigative-reports/coronial-recommendations-project-report--2006- The Coronial Recommendations Project Report: An investigation into the administrative practice of Queensland public sector agencies in assisting coronial inquiries and responding to coronial recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Governance ==
The NCIS is managed by the Victorian Department of Justice and Regulation and governed by a Board of Management composed of coronial, public health, and rotating jurisdictional representatives from Australian States and Territories and New Zealand.

Funding for the NCIS is provided annually from core funding agencies, including:

* Australian State/Territory Justice Departments
* [[Ministry of Justice (New Zealand)|New Zealand Ministry of Justice]] 
* [[Department of Health (Australia)|Commonwealth Department of Health]]
* [[Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development|Commonwealth Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development]]
* [[Safe Work Australia]]
* [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]]

'''Omar Alberto Rupp''' was the only Argentine killed during the sinking of [[ARA Narwal|ARA ''Narwal'']], an Argentine trawler, during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.

== Early life ==
Rupp was born in [[Bahía Blanca]], [[Argentina]], of [[Volga German]] descent. 

== Falklands War ==
The large [[Fishing trawler|trawler]] ''Narwal'' was a [[fishing ship]], but while at [[Mar del Plata]], the crew were asked to sail to the Falklands area to collect [[ELINT|intelligence]] for the [[Argentine Navy]]. The captain had told Rupp that he could go to Bahía Blanca to see his newborn son for the first time, but he said he would go when they returned.

''Narwal'' was bombed on 9 May 1982 by [[Sea Harriers]] of the [[Fleet Air Arm]] and Rupp was the only one killed.

With his legs almost severed by the impact of an unexploded bomb, his last words to the captain while dying became famous: ''Capi, no voy a poder ver a mi hijo'' ("Chief, I will never know my son").

== Aftermath ==
Omar Alberto Rupp is now the name of some town squares, schools and monuments in Argentina.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9670">The '''paradox of enrichment''' is a term from [[population ecology]] coined by [[Michael Rosenzweig]] in 1971.  He described an effect in six [[Predator–prey equations|predator–prey models]] where increasing the food available to the prey caused the predator's population to destabilize. A common example is that if the food supply of a prey such as a rabbit is overabundant, its population will grow unbounded and cause the predator population (such as a lynx) to grow unsustainably large. That may result in a crash in the population of the predators and possibly lead to local eradication or even species extinction.

The term 'paradox' has been used since then to describe this effect in slightly conflicting ways. The original sense was one of irony; by attempting to increase the carrying capacity in an ecosystem, one could fatally imbalance it. Since then, some authors have used the word to describe the difference between modelled and real predator–prey interactions.

Rosenzweig used [[ordinary differential equation]] models to simulate the prey population that represented only prey populations. Enrichment was taken to be increasing the prey [[carrying capacity]] and showing that the prey population destabilized, usually into a [[limit cycle]].  

The cycling behavior after destabilization was more thoroughly explored in a subsequent paper (May 1972) and discussion (Gilpin and Rozenzweig 1972).

==Model and exception==
Many studies have been done on the paradox of enrichment since Rosenzweig, and some have shown that the model initially proposed does not hold in all circumstances, as summarised by Roy and Chattopadhyay in 2007, such as these exceptions:

*Inedible prey: if there are multiple prey species and not all are edible, some may absorb nutrients and stabilise cyclicity.
*Invulnerable prey: even with a single prey species, if there is a degree of temporal or spatial refuge (the prey can hide from the predator), destabilisation may not happen.
*Unpalatable prey: if prey do not fulfil the nutritional preferences of the predator to as great an extent at higher densities, as with some algae and grazers, there may be a stabilising effect.
*Heterogeneous environment: the model for enrichment follows an assumption of environmental homogeneity. If a spatiotemporally chaotic, heterogeneous environment is introduced, cyclic patterns may not arise.
*Induced defense: if there is a predation-dependent response from prey species, it may act to decelerate the downward swing of population caused by the boom in predator population. An example is of ''[[Daphnia]]'' and  fish predators.
*Autotoxins and other predator density-dependent effects: if predator density cannot increase in proportion to that of prey, destabilising periodicities may not develop.
*Prey toxicity: if there is a significant cost to the predator of consuming the (now very dense) prey species, predator numbers may not increase sufficiently to give periodicity.

==Link with Hopf bifurcation==

The paradox of enrichment can be accounted for by the [[bifurcation theory]]. As the [[carrying capacity]] increases, the equilibrium of the [[dynamical system]] becomes unstable.

The bifurcation can be obtained by modifying the [[Lotka–Volterra equation]]. First, one assumes that the growth of the prey population is determined by the [[logistic function|logistic equation]]. Then, one assumes that predators have a nonlinear [[functional response]], typically of type II. The saturation in consumption may be caused by the time to handle the prey or satiety effects.

Thus, one can write the following (normalized) equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, y) = x\left(1 - \frac{x}{K}\right) - y \frac{x}{1 + x}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt} = g(x, y) = -y\left(\gamma - \delta \frac{x}{1 + x}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

*''x'' is the [[prey]] density;
*''y'' is the [[predator]] density;
*''K'' is the prey population's [[carrying capacity]];
*''γ'' and ''δ'' are predator population's parameters (rate of decay and benefits of consumption, respectively).

The term &lt;math&gt;x\left(1 - \frac{x}{K}\right)&lt;/math&gt; represents the prey's logistic growth, and &lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{1 + x}&lt;/math&gt; the predator's functional response.

The prey [[isocline]]s (points at which the prey population does not change, ''i.e.'' dx/dt = 0) are easily obtained as &lt;math&gt;\ x = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = (1 + x) \left(1 - x/K \right)&lt;/math&gt;. Likewise, the predator isoclines are obtained as &lt;math&gt;\ y = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{\gamma}{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;. The intersections of the isoclines yields three equilibrium states:

:&lt;math&gt;x_1 = 0,\; y_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_2 = K,\; y_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_3 = \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha},\; y_3 = (1 + x_3) \left(1 - \frac{x_3}{K}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The first equilibrium corresponds to the extinction of both predator and prey, the second one to the extinction of the predator and the third to co-existence.

By the [[Hartman–Grobman theorem]], one can determine the stability of the steady states by approximating the nonlinear system by a linear system. After differentiating each &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in a neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;(x_3, y_3)&lt;/math&gt;, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\begin{bmatrix}x - x_3\\y - y_3\\\end{bmatrix} \approx \begin{bmatrix}\alpha\left( 1 - (1 + 2 x_3)/K \right)&amp;- \alpha\\ \delta (1 - \alpha)^2 y_3 &amp; 0\\\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}x - x_3\\y - y_3\\\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to find the exact solution of this linear system, but here, the only interest is in the qualitative behavior. If both [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of the [[community matrix]] have negative real part, then by the [[stable manifold theorem]] the system converges to a limit point. Since the [[determinant]] is equal to the product of the eigenvalues and is positive, both eigenvalues have the same sign. Since the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] is equal to the sum of the eigenvalues, the system is stable if

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\left(1 - \frac{1+2x_3}{K}\right) &lt; 0, \text{ or } K &lt; 1 + 2\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

At that critical value of the parameter K, the system undergoes a [[Hopf bifurcation]]. It comes as counterintuitive (hence the term 'paradox') because increasing the carrying capacity of the ecological system beyond a certain value leads to dynamic instability and extinction of the predator species.

==Arguments against paradox==

A credible, simple alternative to the Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model and its common prey dependent generalizations is the ratio dependent or [[Arditi–Ginzburg equations|Arditi–Ginzburg model]].&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. (1989) [http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/ginzburglab/Coupling%20in%20Predator-Prey%20Dynamics%20-%20Arditi%20and%20Ginzburg,%201989.pdf "Coupling in predator–prey dynamics: ratio dependence"] ''Journal of Theoretical Biology'', '''139''': 311–326.&lt;/ref&gt; The two are the extremes of the spectrum of predator interference models. According to the authors of the alternative view, the data show that true interactions in nature are so far from the Lotka–Volterra extreme on the interference spectrum that the model can simply be discounted as wrong. They are much closer to the ratio dependent extreme so if a simple model is needed one can use the Arditi–Ginzburg model as the first approximation.&lt;ref&gt;Arditi, R. and Ginzburg, L.R. (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=c2m6XspGs-cC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=%22How+Species+Interact:+Altering+the+Standard+View+on+Trophic+Ecology%22&amp;ots=CLPI8KgYU5&amp;sig=5WWhmaSEbWpX9jESMJFI9r2VWsI ''How Species Interact: Altering the Standard View on Trophic Ecology''] Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|9780199913831}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The presence of the paradox is strongly dependent on the assumption of the prey dependence of the functional response; because of this the ratio dependent Arditi–Ginzburg model does not have the paradoxical behavior. The authors claim that the paradox is absent in nature (simple laboratory systems may be the exception) is in fact a strong argument for their alternative view of the basic equations.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, C. XJ., and Ginzburg, L.R. (2005) [http://www.christopherxjjensen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Jensen-and-Ginzburg-2005.pdf "Paradoxes or theoretical failures? The jury is still out."] ''Ecological Modeling'', '''118''':3–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sam Adams''' (born May 9, 1946) is an [[United States|American]] [[professional golfer]] who played on the [[PGA Tour]]. He is one of few left-handers to ever win a PGA Tour event.

Adams was born in [[Boone, North Carolina]]. He played golf collegiately at [[Appalachian State University]]. He turned professional in 1969.

On September 30, 1973, Adams recorded the only victory of his PGA Tour career, posting a 16-under-par 268 at the [[Quad Cities Open]] to win by three strokes over [[Dwight Nevil]] and [[Kermit Zarley]]. He was the first American lefty to win on the PGA Tour. He also had several other top-10 finishes including a T-2 finish at the 1972 [[Canadian Open (golf)|Canadian Open]]. His best finish in a [[Men's major golf championships|major championship]] was a T-23 at the 1977 [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]].

Adams played on the Sunbelt Senior Tour after reaching age 50.

[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] video [[game designer]] best known as the creator of [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise and the founder of [[video game developer]] [[Game Freak]]. A fan of [[arcade game]]s, Tajiri wrote for and edited his own video gaming [[fanzine]] [[Game Freak (magazine)|''Game Freak'']] with [[Ken Sugimori]], before evolving it into a development company of the same name. Tajiri claims that the joining of two [[Game Boy]]s via a link cable inspired him to create a game which embodied the collection and companionship of his childhood hobby, [[insect collecting]]. The game, which became ''[[Pokémon Red]]'' and ''[[Pokémon Green]]'', took six years to complete and went on to spark a multibillion-dollar franchise which reinvigorated [[Nintendo]]'s [[Handheld game console|handheld gaming]]. Tajiri continued to work as director for the ''Pokémon'' series until the development of [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pokémon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], when he changed his role to simply executive producer.

Tajiri has also worked for other projects including ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' spin-offs. His work has earned him numerous accolades from his peers. He is also an executive producer for the live-action film ''[[Pokémon: Detective Pikachu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pokémon Detective Pikachu |url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/pokemon-detective-pikachu/details |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Tajiri was born on August 28, 1965, in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name=Time2/&gt; Tajiri grew up in [[Machida, Tokyo]], which, at the time still maintained a rural atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; As a child, Tajiri enjoyed [[insect collecting]] as a hobby, which would be an inspiration for his later video game work.&lt;ref name=Top&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/lists/top-100-game-creators/69|title=Top 100 Game Creators of All Time|year=2009|publisher=[[IGN]]. [[News Corporation]]|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other children called him "Dr. Bug",&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; and he wanted to become an [[entomologist]].&lt;ref name=Time2/&gt; As urban areas of Japan spread and more land was paved over, habitats for hunting bugs were lost. Tajiri wanted his games to allow children to have the feeling of catching and collecting creatures as he had.&lt;ref name=Top/&gt; 

He became fascinated with [[arcade game]]s as a teenager, though his parents thought him a [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquent]] for this pastime.&lt;ref name=Time2/&gt; He particularly enjoyed playing [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]'s ''[[Space Invaders]]'', which drew him into other video games.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; His interest eventually evolved into attempting to plan his own games. He took his [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] apart to see how it worked, and won a contest for a video game idea sponsored by [[Sega]].&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

Because of his fascination with video games, Tajiri frequently [[Truancy|cut classes]] and nearly did not graduate high school. This confused and upset his parents, who felt that he was discarding his own future. His father attempted to get him a job at [[The Tokyo Electric Power Company]], but Tajiri declined to take the position.&lt;ref name=Time2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,34342-2,00.html|title=Beware of the Pokemania|last=Chua-Eoan|first=Howard|author2=Tim Larimer |date=14 November 1999|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=28 January 2010|location=[[New York City]]|authorlink=Howard G.

==Career==

[[File:The Story of Satoshi Tajiri.webm|thumb|An animated history of how Satoshi Tajiri came to conceive ''Pokémon'']]

It was illustrated by [[Ken Sugimori]].&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Satoshi created the Game Freak fanzine to help out gamers. It contained tips on winning games, as well as lists of [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]] in games. The highest number of copies he has sold was over 10,000 which was about a game called Zabius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2040095,00.html|title=The Ultimate Game Freak|date=1999-11-22|work=Time|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, [[Ken Sugimori]], who later illustrated the first 151 Pokémon, saw the magazine at a [[dōjinshi]] shop, and became involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohler|first=Chris|title=Power-up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|year=2004|pages=238|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|authorlink=Chris Kohler}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more contributors came to ''Game Freak'', Tajiri began to realize that most games were lacking in quality, and he and Sugimori decided the solution was to make their own games.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Tajiri studied the ''[[Family BASIC]]'' game programming package, to better grasp the concepts of Famicom game design. He then purchased the requisite hardware for game development.&lt;ref name="RG-35"/&gt; Tajiri and Sugimori evolved the magazine into the video game development company [[Game Freak]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/16708/page_62.html|title=Pokemon Blue Version|year=2010|publisher=[[IGN]].

[[UGO Networks]]|accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tajiri also wrote as a freelance writer for the magazine ''Famicom Hisshōbon'', later called ''Hippon'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2007/02/column_game_mag_weaseling_the_4.php|title='Game Mag Weaseling': The Bluffer's Guide to Famitsu's Competition|last=Gifford|first=Kevin|date=18 February 2007|publisher=GameSetWatch. Think Services|accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reviewed arcade games for ''Family Computer Magazine'' and ''[[Famitsu|Famicom Tsūshin]]''.

Tajiri first conceived the idea of ''Pokémon'' in 1990.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larimer|first=Tim|date=22 November 1999|title=The Ultimate Game Freak|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|location=[[New York City]]|volume=154|issue=20|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2040095,00.html|accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea came together after he saw a [[Game Boy]] and the ability to communicate between Game Boys,&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; and Tajiri decided ''Pokémon'' made the most sense on the handheld console. When he thought about the link cable being able to interact with two Game Boys, he envisioned bugs crawling back and forth, recalling his childhood love of bug collecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2040095,00.html|title=The Ultimate Game Freak|date=1999-11-22|work=Time|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tajiri pioneered the idea of connectivity between [[handheld game console]]s, by suggesting that [[Game Boy]]s could use their [[Game Link Cable|link cable]]s in order to have friends do more than simply play against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3979/the_art_of_balance_pokmons_.php|title=The Art of Balance: Pokémon's Masuda on Complexity and Simplicity|last=Nutt|first=Christian|date=3 April 2009|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]. [[United Business Media]]|accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of the two systems communicating with was for the players to be able to trade Pokemon with one another.

When he first pitched the idea of ''Pokémon'' to [[Nintendo]], they could not quite grasp the concept, but were impressed enough with Tajiri's game design reputation that they decided to explore it. [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] began to mentor Tajiri, guiding him during the creation process.&lt;ref name=Time2/&gt; [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Pokémon Red'' and ''Blue'']] took six years to produce, and nearly bankrupted Game Freak in the process; often, there was barely enough money to pay the employees.&lt;ref name=Time2/&gt; Five employees quit, and Tajiri did not take a salary, instead living off of his father's income.&lt;ref name=Time2/&gt; Investment from [[Creatures Inc.]] allowed Game Freak to complete the games, and in return, Creatures received one-third of the franchise rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/1999/0726/028_01.html|title=Monster mash|last=Fulford|first=Benjamin|date=26 July 2009|publisher=[[Forbes.com]]|accessdate=28 January 2010|authorlink=Benjamin Fulford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the approval and completion stages of the project, Tajiri assisted in the design of two ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' spin-off games for Nintendo: ''[[Yoshi (video game)|Yoshi]]'' and the Japanese-only release ''[[Mario &amp; Wario]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1999/11/15/1999-11-15_king_of_craze_too_shy_for_sp.html|title=King of Craze Too Shy For Spotlight Pifather Is an Introvert|last=Peterson|first=Helen|date=15 November 1999|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman]]|accessdate=28 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815034205/http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-11-15/news/18108980_1_pokemon-craze-satoshi-tajiri-insects|archivedate=15 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked on 1994's ''[[Pulseman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/pulseman|title=Pulseman|year=2010|publisher=[[MobyGames]].|accessdate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the games were completed, very few media outlets gave it attention, believing the Game Boy was a dead console; a general lack of interest of merchandising convinced Tajiri that Nintendo would reject the games.&lt;ref name=Time2/&gt; The ''Pokémon'' games were not expected to do well, but sales steadily increased until the series found itself among [[Nintendo]]'s top franchises.&lt;ref name=Top/&gt; Rumors of a hidden Pokémon creature named [[Mew (Pokémon)|Mew]], which could only be obtained by exploiting programming errors, increased interest in the game.&lt;ref name=Time2/&gt; Tajiri had included Mew in the game in order to promote trading and interaction between players, but Nintendo was not aware of the creature upon release.&lt;ref name=Shinn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/htgg/cgi-bin/drupal/sites/default/files2/gshin_2004_1.pdf|title=Case Study: First Generation Pokémon Games  for the Nintendo Game Boy|last=Shinn|first=Gini|date=16 March 2004|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|pages=4|accessdate=28 January 2010|location=[[Stanford, California]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The franchise helped [[Nintendo]]'s waning sales.&lt;ref name=EGM/&gt; Tajiri deliberately toned down violence in his games. In this vein, he designed Pokémon creatures to faint rather than die upon their defeat, as he believed it was unhealthy for children to equate the concept of death with losing a game.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; After the completion and release of ''Red'' and ''Blue'' in Japan, Tajiri later worked on 1997's ''Bushi Seiryūden: Futari no Yūsha''.&lt;ref name="BSFnY_credits"&gt;Closing credits of ''Bushi Seiryūden: Futari no Yūsha''.&lt;/ref&gt; Tajiri continues to be involved in the more modern ''Pokémon'' titles as well. For [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen]], he supervised the process from start to finish and approved all the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/514/514962p1.html|title=E3 2004: The Pokemon Creators Speak|last=Harris|first=Craig|date=13 May 2004|publisher=[[IGN]]. [[News Corporation]]|accessdate=27 January 2010|authorlink=Craig Harris (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; While developing games, Tajiri works irregular hours, often laboring 24 hours at a time and resting 12 hours.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

===Inspirations===
Tajiri cites [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] as a major influence, thinking of him as a sort of mentor. For this reason, his developmental style closely matches that of Miyamoto.&lt;ref name=Top/&gt; In the [[Pokémon (anime)|''Pokémon'' anime]], the main character is named Satoshi, and his rival is Shigeru.&lt;ref name=Top/&gt;

Tajiri drew much of his inspiration from old Japanese shows and anime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2010 |title = Pokémon|encyclopedia= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher= [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|location=[[Chicago]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1493458/Pokemon|accessdate=28 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Godzilla]] and [[Ultraman]] {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. He has stated that if he did not design video games, he would most likely be in the [[anime]] field.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

===Awards and recognition===
[[IGN]] named Tajiri one of the top 100 game creators of all time, mainly for his ability to have built ''Pokémon'' into a "worldwide phenomenon".&lt;ref name=Top/&gt; [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] credited Tajiri as one of the 10 most influential people who made the modern video game market.&lt;ref name=EGM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3141771|title=Top 10 Most Influential People|last=EGM Staff|date=30 June 2005|publisher=[[1UP.com]]. [[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video game magazine ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' placed Tajiri on their list of the "Hot 100 Game Developers of 2008".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/hot-100-game-developers-2008|title=The Hot 100 Game Developers of 2008|last=Staff|date=20 February 2008|work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|accessdate=27 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509035446/http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8736&amp;Itemid=2&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=10|archivedate=9 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tajiri, alongside [[Tsunekazu Ishihara]], received the Special Award from the [[CEDEC Awards|Computer Entertainment Developers Conference]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Josef''' "'''Sepp'''" '''Angerer''' (1899–1961)&lt;ref name="dnb.de"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=simpleSearch&amp;cqlMode=true&amp;query=idn%3D1062753143 |title=Angerer, Josef |author= Deutschen Nationalbibliothek |date= |website= |publisher=DNB, Katalog der Deutschen Nationalbibliothek  |accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a rug merchant and [[art dealer]] who acted as an agent for [[Hermann Göring]]'s private art collection, immediately before and during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Petro"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jonathan Petropoulos|Petropoulos, Jonathan.]]|title=Art as Politics in the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjQO61bvE7gC&amp;pg=PA190|year=1996|publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]]|location=Chapel Hill|isbn=978-0-8078-4809-8|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art that Angerer dealt with for Göring came from a variety of sources: [[Looted art|looted]], acquired using threats, bought on the open market, and appropriated from museums.

== Background ==
Angerer was director of Quantmeyer &amp; Eicke, of Kronenstrasse 61, Berlin, importers of rugs, furniture and works of art. In art matters he was second only to [[Walter Hofer]] in importance to Göring.&lt;ref name=looted /&gt; Angerer used his international contacts to find art for the Göring collection and arranged the sale of the modern works that Göring did not want, thus raising funds to buy the tapestries and old master works that Göring preferred.&lt;ref name=Petr79 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindsay /&gt; Although he had strong Nazi connections, Angerer held no official position within the Nazi state.&lt;ref&gt;Petropoulos, 1996, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

== "Degenerate art" ==
The Nazis regarded any art that did not fit with their ideas of what art should be as [[Degenerate art]]. Almost all modern art was regarded as "degenerate". It was banned under the regime, seized and placed in special storehouses, and the artists who produced it were subject to sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10077|title="Entartete Kunst", Art Terms|publisher=www.moma.org|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.de/conspiracies-swirl-in-1939-nazi-art-burning/a-17510022 "Conspiracies swirl in 1939 Nazi art burning."] Daniela Späth/ lbh, ''DW'', 20 March 2014. Retrieved 2 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Göring removed 13 paintings from the store of seized "degenerate art" at Kopenickerstrasse. Among others, works of [[Paul Cézanne]] and Vincent van Gogh that he sold through Angerer. German-born Dutch national Franz Koenig&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-135521688 "Rogues' Gallery,"] Godfrey Barker, ''[[The Evening Standard]]'', 26 August 2005. questia.com Retrieved 3 December 2014. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; bought [[Vincent Van Gogh|Van Gogh's]] ''[[Portrait of Dr. Gachet]]'' (first version, 1890)&lt;ref&gt;Originally at the Frankfurt Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Daubigny's Garden]]'' (1890),&lt;ref&gt;Originally at the [[Sanssouci palace|Palace of Sanssouci]] at Potsdam.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]'s ''The Quarry'' (c. 1900).&lt;ref&gt;Originally at Essen.&lt;/ref&gt; Koenig died in 1941 when he fell under a train at Cologne station.  According to  Ivan Lindsay, Koenig was killed by the Nazis, so his collection of [[Old Masters|old master]] drawings could be taken from him. Of the remaining paintings, one by [[Edward Munch]] and one by [[Paul Signac]] were sold by Angerer in Sweden and two further Munchs in London. Göring paid compensation to the [[Städel Museum]] for the Van Gogh and the [[Folkwang Museum]] for the Cézanne but at a fraction of the paintings true worth.&lt;ref name=Lindsay&gt;{{cite book|author=Lindsay, Ivan.|title=The History of Loot and Stolen Art: from Antiquity until the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8G7BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT413|year=2014|publisher=Andrews UK|location=London|isbn=978-1-906509-56-9|pages=413–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gifts for Hitler ==
Top Nazis liked to give each other gifts of art. When Göring desired to give [[Adolf Hitler]] a gift, he asked Angerer to buy eight Flemish [[Tapestry|tapestries]] from [[Albert Auwercx]]'s series of ''"Gothic Myths"'',&lt;ref name=Lindsay /&gt; as the Nazis called these allegorical subjects. Göring's own deals could be mixed into such transactions in order to disguise them.&lt;ref name=Petr79&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mjQO61bvE7gC&amp;pg=PA79 Petropoulos, 1996, pp. 79-80.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities in Italy ==
Angerer was asked by Göring to buy six [[Tapestry|tapestries]] in Italy for 400,000 Lire.&lt;ref name=Lindsay /&gt; He took a dozen to Göring in Berlin in August 1941 of which Göring bought six.{{fact|date=December 2015}} On a trip to Florence, around 1942, Angerer and the local German consul [[Gerhard Wolf]] went on a tour of [[Alessandro Contini-Bonacossi|Count Bonacossi]]'s collection. Angerer supposedly told the count, "What a pity you're not a Jew!" and drawing a finger across his throat continued "If you were a Jew, we could do just that! And all the paintings would be ours!" Forewarned of a German art raid, local collections had already removed their best items and hidden them elsewhere behind false walls. Records had been falsified and the remaining works spaced out to disguise the absences. Enquirers after the Jewish art historian [[Bernard Berenson]]'s collection were told that he had fled to Portugal with the help of the Vatican and that nothing of importance remained in Florence. In fact, he was still in Italy, awaiting the Allied liberation.&lt;ref name="Samuels"&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuels, Ernest &amp; Jayne Samuels.|title=Bernard Berenson, the Making of a Legend|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fzdlbNBUsJsC&amp;pg=PA478|year=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-06779-0|pages=478-479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post war ==
Angerer was interrogated by the Allies in the Autumn of 1945. He was placed under arrest and his home at [[Berchtesgaden]], which he had shared with [[Fritz Görnnert]] (Göring's personal assistant), was searched.&lt;ref&gt;Angerer had occupied the ground floor and Görnnert and his wife the two upper storeys.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Carr Howe Jr.]], one of the U.S. "monuments men" charged with recovering looted art, described what he found there:

"The house was an unpretentious villa hidden among pine trees high up in the hills above the town. The place was under guard. On the ground floor we examined the contents of a small storeroom. There were several cases bearing Angerer's name and three or four large crates containing Italian furniture. A similar storeroom on the second floor contained a dozen tapestries, a pile of Oriental rugs, a large collection of church vestments and nearly a hundred rare textiles mounted on cardboard. … Concealed beneath the tapestries were ten cases, each one about two feet square and a foot high... On each one was stenciled in Gothic letters: "Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring." They contained a magnificent collection of Oriental weapons."&lt;ref&gt;Howe Jr, Thomas Carr. (1946) ''[https://www.questia.com/read/228577 Salt Mines and Castles: The Discovery and Restitution of Looted European Art]''. Indianapolis: [[Bobbs-Merrill Company]], pp. 219-220. questia.com Retrieved 21 December 2014. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Angerer was placed on the American [[Office of Strategic Services]] special counterintelligence [[X-2 Counter Espionage Branch#Special units|Art Looting Investigation Unit]]'s [[Art Looting Intelligence Unit (ALIU) Reports 1945-1946 and ALIU Red Flag Names List and Index | "red flag" list]] of people and organisations that were involved in the art trade under the [[Nazis]].&lt;ref name=looted&gt;[http://www.lootedart.com/MVI3RM469661 Post-War Reports: Art Looting Intelligence Unit (ALIU) Reports 1945–1946 and ALIU Red Flag Names List and Index.] lootedart.com Retrieved 27 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; His life after that is unclear.

==Reception==
Yen Press' English edition of the first light novel volume received a positive review from [[Anime News Network]]. It was praised for its "believable characters" and the thought that "switching between the hero and villain's point of view really works." However, it was said that Shimeji's illustrations can make Takaesu (the antagonist of the first volume) "more wolf-like than shark-like in some images."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/the-isolator/realization-of-absolute-solitude/novel-1/.89954|title=The Isolator: Realization of Absolute Solitude - Novel 1 - The Biter|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 11, 2015|accessdate=November 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Verification and validation''' are independent procedures that are used together for checking that a product, service, or system meets [[requirement]]s and [[specification (technical standard)|specifications]] and that it fulfills its intended purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Global Harmonization Task Force - ''Quality Management Systems - Process Validation Guidance'' (GHTF/SG3/N99-10:2004 (Edition 2) page 3&lt;/ref&gt; These are critical components of a [[quality management system]] such as [[ISO 9000]]. The words "verification" and "validation" are sometimes preceded with "independent", indicating that the verification and validation is to be performed by a disinterested third party. "Independent verification and validation" can be abbreviated as "'''IV&amp;V'''".

In practice, as quality management terms, the definitions of verification and validation can be inconsistent.  Sometimes they are even used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Ad Sparrius |title= Everything You Thought You Knew about Validation and Verification is Probably Dodgy |journal= 12th [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]] SA Systems Engineering Conference |year= 2016 |url= http://mediachef.co.za/incose2016/Papers/INCOSE_SA_2016_paper_48.pdf |access-date= 2018-04-30 |quote= There are some authors who apparently regard these two terms as synonymous, others who seem to be only vaguely aware of the differences.

However, [[A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge|the PMBOK guide]], a standard adopted by [[IEEE]], defines them as follows in its 4th edition:&lt;ref name=pmboked4&gt;{{cite web |title=IEEE Guide--Adoption of the Project Management Institute (PMI®) Standard A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide)--Fourth Edition |last=[[IEEE]] |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5937011/ |accessdate=28 March 2017 |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2011.5937011 |page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Validation. The assurance that a product, service, or system meets the needs of the customer and other identified stakeholders. It often involves acceptance and suitability with external customers. Contrast with ''verification''."
* "Verification. The evaluation of whether or not a product, service, or system complies with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition. It is often an internal process. Contrast with ''validation''."

== Overview ==

Verification is intended to check that a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) meets a set of design specifications.&lt;ref&gt;"Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary," [[ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]/[[IEEE]] std 24765:2010(E), 2010. | verification 5. ...product, service, or system complies with a regulation, requirement, specification, or imposed condition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IEEE_1012 &gt;{{cite | title=IEEE 1012-2004 |publisher=[[IEEE]] |date=2004 | page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the development phase, verification procedures involve performing special tests to model or simulate a portion, or the entirety, of a product, service or system, then performing a review or analysis of the modeling results. In the post-development phase, verification procedures involve regularly repeating tests devised specifically to ensure that the product, service, or system continues to meet the initial design requirements, specifications, and regulations as time progresses.&lt;ref name=IEEE_1012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary," [[ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]/[[IEEE]] std 24765:2010(E), 2010. | verification 6. ...comply with requirements (e.g., for correctness, completeness, consistency, and accuracy) for all life
cycle activities during each life cycle process (acquisition, supply, development, ''operation'', and ''maintenance'')&lt;/ref&gt; It is a process that is used to evaluate whether a product, service, or system complies with regulations, [[specification]]s, or conditions imposed at the start of a development phase. Verification can be in development, scale-up, or production. This is often an internal process.

Validation is intended to ensure a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) results in a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) that meets the operational needs of the user.&lt;ref name=IEEE_1012 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary," [[ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]/[[IEEE]] std 24765:2010(E), 2010. | validation (especially 1. &amp; 2.)&lt;/ref&gt; For a new development flow or verification flow, validation procedures may involve modeling either flow and using simulations to predict faults or gaps that might lead to invalid or incomplete verification or development of a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof). A set of validation requirements (as defined by the user), specifications, and regulations may then be used as a basis for qualifying a development flow or verification flow for a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof). Additional validation procedures also include those that are designed specifically to ensure that modifications made to an existing qualified development flow or verification flow will have the effect of producing a product, service, or system (or portion thereof, or set thereof) that meets the initial design requirements, specifications, and regulations; these validations help to keep the flow qualified.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} It is a process of establishing evidence that provides a high degree of assurance that a product, service, or system accomplishes its intended requirements. This often involves acceptance of fitness for purpose with end users and other product stakeholders. This is often an external process.

It is sometimes said that validation can be expressed by the query "Are you building the right thing?"&lt;ref name="Boehm"&gt;[[Barry Boehm]], ''Software Engineering Economics'', 1981&lt;/ref&gt; and verification by "Are you building it right?".&lt;ref name="Boehm"/&gt; "Building the right thing" refers back to the user's needs, while "building it right" checks that the specifications are correctly implemented by the system. In some contexts, it is required to have written requirements for both as well as formal procedures or protocols for determining compliance.

It is entirely possible that a product passes when verified but fails when validated. This can happen when, say, a product is built as per the specifications but the specifications themselves fail to address the user's needs.

== Activities ==
Verification of machinery and equipment usually consists of design qualification (DQ), installation qualification (IQ), operational qualification (OQ), and performance qualification (PQ).  DQ may be performed by a vendor or by the user, by confirming through review and testing that the equipment meets the written acquisition specification. If the relevant document or manuals of machinery/equipment are provided by vendors, the later 3Q needs to be thoroughly performed by the users who work in an industrial regulatory environment. Otherwise, the process of IQ, OQ and PQ is the task of validation. The typical example of such a case could be the loss or absence of vendor's documentation for legacy equipment or [[do-it-yourself]] (DIY) assemblies (e.g., cars, computers etc.) and, therefore, users should endeavour to acquire DQ document beforehand. Each template of DQ, IQ, OQ and PQ usually can be found on the internet respectively, whereas the DIY qualifications of machinery/equipment can be assisted either by the vendor's training course materials and tutorials, or by the published guidance books, such as ''step-by-step'' series if the acquisition of machinery/equipment is not bundled with on- site qualification services. This kind of the DIY approach is also applicable to the qualifications of software, computer operating systems and a manufacturing process. The most important and critical task as the last step of the activity is to generating and archiving machinery/equipment qualification reports for auditing purposes, if regulatory compliances are mandatory.

Qualification of machinery/equipment is venue dependent, in particular items that are shock sensitive and require balancing or [[Positioning technology#Mechanical linkage|calibration]], and re-qualification needs to be conducted once the objects are relocated. The full scales of some equipment qualifications are even time dependent as consumables are used up (i.e. filters) or springs [[Metal fatigue|stretch]] out, requiring [[Positioning technology#Mechanical linkage|recalibration]], and hence re-certification is necessary when a specified due time lapse.&lt;ref name=wel&gt;{{cite web | last = Analytical &amp; Precision Balance Co. | title = Welcome | url = http://www.analyticalandprecision.com/ | accessdate = 18 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ec&gt;{{cite web | last = Scientech | title = External Calibration | url = http://www.scalenet.com/scientech/factors.html | accessdate = 18 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-qualification of machinery/equipment should also be conducted when replacement of parts, or coupling with another device, or installing a new [[application software]] and restructuring of the computer which affects especially the pre-settings, such as on [[BIOS]], [[Windows Registry|registry]], [[GUID Partition Table|disk drive partition table]], dynamically-linked (shared) libraries, or an [[ini file]] etc., have been necessary. In such a situation, the specifications of the parts/devices/software and restructuring proposals should be appended to the qualification document whether the parts/devices/software are genuine or not. Torres and Hyman have discussed the suitability of non-genuine parts for clinical use and provided guidelines for equipment users to select appropriate substitutes which are capable to avoid adverse effects.&lt;ref name=rpisi&gt;{{cite web | last = Torres | first = Rebecca E. |author2=William A. Hyman  | title = Replacement Parts-Identical, Suitable, or Inappropriate? | year = 2007 | url = http://pt.wkhealth.com/pt/re/jce/abstract.00004669-200710000-00028.htm;jsessionid=HnHfvQKXh1nGWbpxR9LsvgcGQQ1111QBXgnq7ncT2Fvfrvh38CL9!923867264!181195629!8091!-1 | accessdate = 29 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case when genuine parts/devices/software are demanded by some of regulatory requirements, then re-qualification does not need to be conducted on the non-genuine assemblies. Instead, the asset has to be recycled for non-regulatory purposes.

When machinery/equipment qualification is conducted by a standard endorsed third party such as by an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard accredited company for a particular division, the process is called certification.&lt;ref name=iicp&gt;{{cite web | last = AppLabs | title = ISV, IHV Certification Programs | url = http://www.applabs.com/html/certificationprograms.html | accessdate = 26 March 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080216214101/http://www.applabs.com/html/certificationprograms.html |archivedate = 16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaia&gt;{{cite web | last = AppLabs | title = AppLabs attains ISO27001:2005 accreditation | url = http://www.applabs.com/html/ISO270012005Accreditation_230.html | accessdate = 26 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the coverage of [[ISO/IEC 15408]] certification by an [[ISO/IEC 27001]] accredited organization is limited; the scheme requires a fair amount of efforts to get popularized.

==Categories of validation==
Validation work can generally be categorized by the following functions:
* Prospective validation – the missions conducted before new items are released to make sure the characteristics of the interests which are functioning properly and which meet safety standards.&lt;ref name=ggpp1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm124720.htm |title=Guideline on general principles of process validation |publisher=[[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] |accessdate=12 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606085627/http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm124720.htm |archivedate=6 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pv&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.novasep.com/misc/glossary.asp?defId=169&amp;lookfor=&amp;search=P | title = Prospective validation | publisher = Groupe Novasep | accessdate = 24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples could be legislative rules, guidelines or proposals,&lt;ref name=pvsfs&gt;{{cite journal | last = Quinn | first = James | last2 = McDermott | first2 = D | last3 = Stiell | first3 = I | last4 = Kohn | first4 = M | last5 = Wells | first5 = G| title = Prospective Validation of the San Francisco Syncope Rule to Predict Patients With Serious Outcomes | journal = Annals of Emergency Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 5 | pages = 448–454 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | year = 2006 | pmid = 16631985| doi = 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2005.11.019 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pvag&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sangiovanni | first = A. | last2 = Manini | first2 = M | last3 = Iavarone | first3 = M | last4 = Fraquelli | first4 = M | last5 = Forzenigo | first5 = L | last6 = Romeo | first6 = R | last7 = Ronchi | first7 = G | last8 = Colombo | first8 = M| title = Prospective validation of AASLD guidelines for the early diagnosis of epatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients | journal = Digestive and Liver Disease | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = A22–A23 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.dld.2007.12.064 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pvwp&gt;{{cite journal | last = Germing | first = U. et al.| last2 = Strupp | first2 = C | last3 = Kuendgen | first3 = A | last4 = Isa | first4 = S | last5 = Knipp | first5 = S | last6 = Hildebrandt | first6 = B | last7 = Giagounidis | first7 = A | last8 = Aul | first8 = C | last9 = Gattermann | first9 = N | last10 = Haas| first10 = R| title = Prospective validation of the WHO proposals for the classification of myelodysplastic syndromes | journal = Haematologica | volume = 91 | issue = 12 | pages = 1596–1604 | year = 2006 | url = http://haematologica.org/cgi/content/abstract/91/12/1596 | accessdate = 24 September 2008 | pmid = 17145595 | display-authors = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; methods,&lt;ref name=riht&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sciolla | first = Rossella | last2 = Melis | first2 = F | last3 = Sinpac  |first3 = Group| title = Rapid Identification of High-Risk Transient Ischemic Attacks: Prospective Validation of the ABCD Score | journal = Stroke | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 297–302 | publisher = American Heart Association | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.496612 | pmid = 18174479 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; theories/hypothesis/models&lt;ref name=dbsf&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pfisterer | first = Matthias et al. | last2 = Bertel | first2 = O | last3 = Bonetti | first3 = P | last4 = Brunnerlarocca | first4 = H | last5 = Eberli | first5 = F | last6 = Erne | first6 = P | last7 = Galatius | first7 = S | last8 = Hornig | first8 = B | last9 = Kiowski | first9 = W| last10 = Pachinger | first10 = Otmar | last11 = Pedrazzini | first11 = Giovanni | last12 = Rickli | first12 = Hans | last13 = De Servi | first13 = Stefano | last14 = Kaiser | first14 = Christoph | title = Drug-eluting or bare-metal stents forlarge coronary vessel stenting?

These terms generally apply broadly across industries and institutions. In addition, they may have very specific meanings and requirements for specific products, regulations, and industries. Some examples:

'''Vittoria Farnese''' (29 April 1618 – 10 August 1649) was an [[Italy|Italian]] noblewoman. She was born in [[Parma]], the daughter of [[Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma]] and [[Margherita Aldobrandini]], niece of [[Pope Clement VIII]]. On 12 February 1648 she married [[Francesco I d'Este]], widower of her sister [[Maria Farnese]]. The couple had one child, Vittoria (1649–1656), and Vittoria died in [[Modena]], giving birth to her.  Francesco then married a third time, to [[Lucrezia Barberini]], in [[Loreto (AN)|Loreto]] in October 1654.

==Content==

[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|left|100px|Idries Shah]]
''Wisdom of the Idiots'' is a book of Sufi [[teaching stories]] designed to influence the reader using traditional [[Sufi psychology]]. Many stories are reminiscences of encounters with Sufis of long ago but experiences highlighted are valuable even from today's perspective. The carefully selected stories contain several levels of meaning and work like psychological mirrors in which the reader may see himself and Reality reflected, and come to understand these better.

'In Idries Shah's ''Wisdom of the Idiots'', the 'idiots' are Sufis, called this because their wisdom penetrates to a depth which renders it inaccessible to the merely intelligent or academically-knowledgeable.'

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfill the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, ''Wisdom of the Idiots'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Reception==

As part of the corpus of teaching stories/traditional psychology, ''Wisdom of the Idiots'' has grabbed the attention of modern researchers into psychology. Various techniques that modern science has claimed for itself are clearly present in materials provided centuries before. The psychologist [[Robert E. Ornstein|Robert Ornstein]] has researched the psychological nature of human mind and brain and their relationship to thought, realised potential, and the applicability of traditional techniques for today's applications. [[Arthur J. Deikman|Arthur Deikman]], a clinical professor of psychiatry and pioneer investigator of mystical states from scientific point of view, studied under Shah and wrote extensively on functional approaches to mysticism.&lt;ref name="SufismAndPsych"&gt;{{cite web

M.Y. Shawarbi, an authority on Islamic culture, scientist and author, says of this book "In comparative religion and metaphysics, the release of over five hundred "teaching stories" in ''Tales of the Dervishes'', and ''Wisdom of the Idiots'', and several other books was recognized in religious and philosophical journals as elucidating a hitherto very imperfectly known system of teaching."   &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Word embedding''' is the collective name for a set of [[language model]]ing and [[feature learning]] techniques in [[natural language processing]] (NLP) where words or phrases from the vocabulary are mapped to [[vector (mathematics)|vectors]] of [[real numbers]]. Conceptually it involves a mathematical [[embedding]] from a space with one dimension per word to a continuous [[vector space]] with a much lower dimension.

Methods to generate this mapping include [[neural net language model|neural networks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1310.4546 |last1=Mikolov |first1=Tomas |title=Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality |last2=Sutskever |first2=Ilya |last3=Chen |first3=Kai |last4=Corrado |first4=Greg |last5=Dean |first5=Jeffrey |class=cs.CL| year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[dimensionality reduction]] on the word [[co-occurrence matrix]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1312.5542 |last1=Lebret |first1=Rémi |title=Word Emdeddings through Hellinger PCA |journal=Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for  Computational Linguistics (EACL) |volume=2014 |last2=Collobert |first2=Ronan |year=2013|bibcode=2013arXiv1312.5542L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |url=http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5477-neural-word-embedding-as-implicit-matrix-factorization.pdf |title=Neural Word Embedding as Implicit Matrix Factorization |last=Levy |first=Omer |conference=NIPS |year=2014 |last2=Goldberg |first2=Yoav}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |url=http://ijcai.org/papers15/Papers/IJCAI15-513.pdf |title=Word Embedding Revisited: A New Representation Learning and Explicit Matrix Factorization Perspective |last=Li |first=Yitan |conference=Int'l J.

Word and phrase embeddings, when used as the underlying input representation, have been shown to boost the performance in NLP tasks such as [[syntactic parsing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Socher |first1=Richard |last2=Bauer |first2=John |last3=Manning |first3=Christopher |last4=Ng |first4=Andrew |title=Parsing with compositional vector grammars |conference=Proc. ACL Conf. |year=2013 |url=http://www.socher.org/uploads/Main/SocherBauerManningNg_ACL2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sentiment analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Socher |first1=Richard |last2=Perelygin |first2=Alex |last3=Wu |first3=Jean |last4=Chuang |first4=Jason |last5=Manning |first5=Chris |last6=Ng |first6=Andrew |last7=Potts |first7=Chris |title=Recursive Deep Models for Semantic Compositionality Over a Sentiment Treebank |conference=EMNLP |year=2013 |url=http://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/EMNLP2013_RNTN.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of technique==
In [[linguistics]] word embeddings were discussed in the research area of [[distributional semantics]]. It aims to quantify and categorize semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data.  The underlying idea that "a word is characterized by the company it keeps" was popularized by [[J. R. Firth|Firth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Firth| first = J.R. | year = 1957 | title = A synopsis of linguistic theory 1930-1955 | journal = Studies in Linguistic Analysis | pages = 1–32 | ref = harv }} Reprinted in {{cite book | editor = F.R. Palmer | title = Selected Papers of J.R. Firth 1952-1959 | publisher = London: Longman | year = 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of representing words as vectors has roots in the 1960s with the development of the [[vector space model]] for information retrieval. Reducing the number of dimensions using [[Singular-value decomposition|singular value decomposition]] then led to the introduction of [[latent semantic analysis]] in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/brief-history-word-embeddings-some-clarifications-magnus-sahlgren/ |first=Magnus|last=Sahlgren | title=A brief history of word embeddings}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2000 [[Yoshua Bengio|Bengio]] et al. provided in a series of papers the "Neural probabilistic language models" to reduce the high dimensionality of words representations in contexts by "learning a distributed representation for words". (Bengio et al, 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Neural Probabilistic Language Model|doi=10.1007/3-540-33486-6_6 | journal=Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing|volume=194 |pages=137–186|year=2006|last1=Bengio|first1=Yoshua|last2=Schwenk |first2=Holger |last3=Senécal |first3=Jean-Sébastien |last4=Morin |first4=Fréderic |last5=Gauvain |first5=Jean-Luc |isbn=978-3-540-30609-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Word embeddings come in two different styles, one in which words are expressed as vectors of co-occurring words, and another in which words are expressed as vectors of linguistic contexts in which the words occur; these different styles are studied in (Lavelli et al, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |year=2004|last1=Lavelli |first1=Alberto |last2=Sebastiani |first2=Fabrizio |last3=Zanoli |first3=Roberto|title=Distributional term representations: an experimental comparison| conference=13th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management|pages=615–624|doi=10.1145/1031171.1031284 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roweis and Saul published in ''Science'' how to use "locally linear embedding" (LLE) to discover representations of high dimensional data structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction by Locally Linear Embedding|journal=Science|volume=290|issue=5500|pages=2323–6|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/290/5500/2323|bibcode=2000Sci...290.2323R|author1=Roweis|first1=Sam T.|last2=Saul|first2=Lawrence K.|year=2000|doi=10.1126/science.290.5500.2323|pmid=11125150|citeseerx=10.1.1.111.3313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area developed gradually and really took off after 2010, partly because important advances had been made since then on the quality of vectors and the training speed of the model.

There are many branches and many research groups working on word embeddings. In 2013, a team at [[Google]] led by Tomas Mikolov created [[word2vec]], a word embedding toolkit which can train vector space models faster than the previous approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/ word2vec]&lt;/ref&gt; Most new word embedding techniques rely on a [[neural network]] architecture instead of more traditional [[n-gram]] models and [[unsupervised learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Scalable Hierarchical Distributed Language Model|pages=1081–1088|url=http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3583-a-scalable-hierarchical-distributed-language-model|publisher=Curran Associates, Inc.|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
One of the main limitations of word embeddings (word [[vector space model]]s in general) is that possible meanings of a word are conflated into a single representation (a single vector in the semantic space). Sense embeddings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Camacho-Collados |first1=Jose |last2=Pilehvar |first2=Mohammad Taher |title= From Word to Sense Embeddings: A Survey on Vector Representations of Meaning | year=2018 |arxiv=1805.04032|bibcode=2018arXiv180504032C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  are a solution to this problem: individual meanings of words are represented as distinct vectors in the space.

==For biological sequences: BioVectors==
Word embeddings for n-grams in biological sequences (e.g. DNA, RNA, and Proteins) for [[bioinformatics]] applications have been proposed by Asgari and Mofrad.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asgari|first1=Ehsaneddin|last2=Mofrad|first2=Mohammad R.K.|title=Continuous Distributed Representation of Biological Sequences for Deep Proteomics and Genomics|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2015|volume=10|issue=11|page=e0141287|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0141287|pmid=26555596|pmc=4640716|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1041287A|arxiv=1503.05140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in [[proteomics]] and [[genomics]]. The results presented by Asgari and Mofrad&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; suggest that BioVectors can characterize biological sequences in terms of biochemical and biophysical interpretations of the underlying patterns.

==Thought vectors==

'''[[Thought vector|Thought vectors]]''' are an extension of word embeddings to entire sentences or even documents. Some researchers hope that these can improve the quality of [[machine translation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title=skip-thought vectors|eprint=1506.06726|last1=Kiros|first1=Ryan|last2=Zhu|first2=Yukun|last3=Salakhutdinov|first3=Ruslan|last4= Zemel|first4=Richard S.|last5=Torralba|first5=Antonio|last6=Urtasun|first6=Raquel|last7=Fidler|first7=Sanja|class=cs.CL|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=thoughtvectors|url=http://deeplearning4j.org/thoughtvectors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software ==
Software for training and using word embeddings includes Tomas Mikolov's [[Word2vec]], Stanford University's [[GloVe (machine learning)|GloVe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/ |title=GloVe}}&lt;/ref&gt; AllenNLP's Elmo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://allennlp.org/elmo |title=Elmo}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fastText]], [[Gensim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/ |title=Gensim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/Lambda-3/Indra |title=Indra|date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Deeplearning4j]]. [[Principal Component Analysis]] (PCA) and [[T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding]] (t-SNE) are both  used to reduce the dimensionality of word vector spaces and visualize word embeddings and [[Word-sense induction|clusters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghassemi|first=Mohammad|last2=Mark|first2=Roger|last3=Nemati|first3=Shamim|date=2015|title=A Visualization of Evolving Clinical Sentiment Using Vector Representations of Clinical Notes|url=http://www.cinc.org/archives/2015/pdf/0629.pdf|journal=Computing in Cardiology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of application ===
For instance, the fastText is also used to calculate word embeddings for [[text corpora]] in [[Sketch Engine]] that are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://embeddings.sketchengine.co.uk/ |title=Embedding Viewer |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Embedding Viewer |publisher=Lexical Computing |access-date=7 Feb 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
