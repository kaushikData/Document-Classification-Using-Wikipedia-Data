'''Ableism in Canada''' refers to a set of discourses, behaviours and structures which express feelings of anxiety, fear, hostility and antipathy towards [[disabled people]] in [[Canada]]. 

==Overview==
The specific types of discrimination that have occurred or are still occurring in Canada include the ability to access to important facilities such as infrastructure within the transport network, restrictive immigration policies, involuntary sterilization to stop the disabled from having offspring, barriers to employment opportunities, a wage that is high enough to maintain a minimal standard of living, and institutionalization of the disabled in substandard conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Policy on ableism and discrimination based on disability |url=http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-ableism-and-discrimination-based-disability |publisher=Ontario Human Rights Commission |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austerity decisions made by the government of Canada have also at time been referred to as ableist, such as funding cuts that put disabled people at risk of living in abusive arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/austerity-left-people-with-disabilities-without-housing-n-s-inquiry-told|title=‘Ableist’ bias left people with disabilities without housing, N.S. inquiry told|date=4 June 2018|work=National Post|accessdate=26 August 2018|first=Michael|last=Tutton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''analysis of competing hypotheses''' ('''ACH''') allegedly provides an unbiased [[methodology]] for evaluating multiple competing hypotheses for observed data. It was developed by [[Richards Heuer|Richards (Dick) J. Heuer, Jr.]], a 45-year veteran of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], in the 1970s for use by the Agency.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt; ACH is used by analysts in various fields who make judgments that entail a high risk of error in reasoning. It helps an analyst overcome, or at least minimize, some of the cognitive limitations that make prescient [[intelligence analysis]] so difficult to achieve.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;

ACH was a step forward in [[Intelligence analysis#Methods of analysis|intelligence analysis methodology]], but it was first described in relatively informal terms. Producing the best available information from [[uncertain data]] remains the goal of researchers, tool-builders, and analysts in industry, academia and government. Their domains include [[data mining]], [[cognitive psychology]] and [[visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]], [[probability]] and [[statistics]], etc. [[Abductive reasoning]] is an earlier concept with similarities to ACH.

==Process==
Heuer outlines the ACH process in considerable depth in his book, ''Psychology of Intelligence Analysis''.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt; It consists of the following steps:
# Hypothesis – The first step of the process is to identify all potential hypotheses, preferably using a group of analysts with different perspectives to [[brainstorming|brainstorm]] the possibilities. The process discourages the analyst from choosing one "likely" hypothesis and using evidence to prove its accuracy. [[Cognitive bias]] is minimized when all possible hypotheses are considered.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;
# Evidence – The analyst then lists evidence and arguments (including assumptions and logical deductions) for and against each hypothesis.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;
# Diagnostics – Using a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], the analyst applies evidence against each hypothesis in an attempt to disprove as many theories as possible. Some evidence will have greater "diagnosticity" than other evidence — that is, some will be more helpful in judging the relative likelihood of alternative hypotheses. This step is the most important, according to Heuer. Instead of looking at one hypothesis and all the evidence ("working down" the matrix), the analyst is encouraged to consider one piece of evidence at a time, and examine it against all possible hypotheses ("working across" the matrix).&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;
# Refinement – The analyst reviews the findings, identifies any gaps, and collects any additional evidence needed to refute as many of the remaining hypotheses as possible.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;
# Inconsistency – The analyst then seeks to draw tentative conclusions about the relative likelihood of each hypothesis. Less consistency implies a lower likelihood. The least consistent hypotheses are eliminated. While the matrix generates a definitive mathematical total for each hypothesis, the analyst must use their judgment to make the final conclusion. The result of the ACH analysis itself must not overrule analysts' own judgments.
# Sensitivity – The analyst tests the conclusions using [[sensitivity analysis]], which weighs how the conclusion would be affected if key evidence or arguments were wrong, misleading, or subject to different interpretations. The validity of key evidence and the consistency of important arguments are double-checked to assure the soundness of the conclusion's [[intelligence analysis#Linchpin analysis|linchpins]] and drivers.&lt;ref name=CH8&gt;{{citation |title=Psychology of Intelligence Analysis |first=Richards J., Jr |last=Heuer |contribution=Chapter 8: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/art11.html |publisher=Center for the Study of Intelligence, [[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Conclusions and evaluation – Finally, the analyst provides the decisionmaker with his or her conclusions, as well as a summary of alternatives that were considered and why they were rejected. The analyst also identifies milestones in the process that can serve as indicators in future analyses.&lt;ref name=CH8/&gt;

==Strengths==
There are many benefits of doing an ACH matrix. It is auditable. It is widely believed to help overcome [[cognitive bias]]es, though there is a lack of strong empirical evidence to support this belief.&lt;ref name=Thomason2010&gt;{{citation |title=Field Evaluation in the Intelligence and Counterintelligence Context:  Workshop Summary |first=Neil |last=Thomason |contribution=Alternative Competing Hypotheses |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12854.html |year=2010 |publisher=National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ACH requires the analyst to construct a matrix, the evidence and hypotheses can be [[backtracking|backtracked]]. This allows the decisionmaker or other analysts to see the sequence of rules and data that led to the conclusion.

==Weaknesses==
The process to create an ACH is time consuming. The ACH matrix can be problematic when analyzing a complex project. It can be cumbersome for an analyst to manage a large database with multiple pieces of evidence.

Especially in intelligence, both governmental and business, analysts must always be aware that the opponent(s) is intelligent and may be generating information intended to [[deception|deceive]].&lt;ref name=Elsaesser&gt;{{citation |contribution=Detecting Deception |first1=Christopher |last1=Elsaesser |first2=Frank J. |last2=Stech |pages=101–124 |year=2007 |title=Adversarial Reasoning: Computational Approaches to Reading the Opponent’s Mind |editor1=Kott, Alexander |editor2=McEneaney, William |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stech&gt;{{citation |title=Deception Detection by Analysis of Competing Hypotheses |first1=Frank J. |last1=Stech |first2=Christopher |last2=Elsaesser |publisher=[[MITRE Corporation]] |url=https://analysis.mitre.org/proceedings/Final_Papers_Files/94_Camera_Ready_Paper.pdf |access-date=2008-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807192930/https://analysis.mitre.org/proceedings/Final_Papers_Files/94_Camera_Ready_Paper.pdf |archive-date=2008-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }} MITRE Sponsored Research Project 51MSR111, Counter-Deception Decision Support&lt;/ref&gt; Since deception often is the result of a cognitive trap, Elsaesser and Stech use state-based hierarchical plan recognition (see [[abductive reasoning]]) to generate causal explanations of observations. The resulting hypotheses are converted to a dynamic [[Bayesian network]] and [[value of information]] analysis is employed to isolate assumptions implicit in the evaluation of paths in, or conclusions of, particular hypotheses. As evidence in the form of observations of states or assumptions is observed, they can become the subject of separate validation. Should an assumption or necessary state be negated, hypotheses depending on it are rejected. This is a form of [[root cause analysis]].

Evidence also presents a problem if it is unreliable. The evidence used in the matrix is static and therefore it can be a snapshot in time.

According to social constructivist critics, ACH also fails to stress sufficiently (or to address as a method) the problematic nature of the initial formation of the hypotheses used to create its grid.  There is considerable evidence, for example, that in addition to any bureaucratic, psychological, or political biases that may affect hypothesis generation, there are also factors of culture and identity at work. These socially constructed factors may restrict or pre-screen which hypotheses end up being considered, and then reinforce confirmation bias in those selected.&lt;ref&gt;Chapters one to four, {{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Milo L. and  |last2=Silberzahn |first2=Philippe|year=2013  |title=Constructing Cassandra, Reframing Intelligence Failure at the CIA, 1947-2001|publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0804793360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher and [[Argumentation theory|argumentation theorist]] [[Tim van Gelder]] has made the following criticisms:&lt;ref name=vanGelder2008&gt;{{citation |title=Can we do better than ACH? |url=http://timvangelder.com/2007/12/31/hypothesis-testing-whats-wrong-with-ach/ |journal=AIPIO News |issue=Issue 55 |date=December 2008 |last=van Gelder |first=Tim |publisher=Australian Institute of Professional Intelligence Officers}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ACH demands that the analyst makes too many discrete judgments, a great many of which contribute little if anything to discerning the best hypothesis
* ACH misconceives the nature of the relationship between items of evidence and hypotheses by supposing that items of evidence are, on their own, consistent or inconsistent with hypotheses.
* ACH treats the hypothesis set as "flat", i.e. a mere list, and so is unable to relate evidence to hypotheses at the appropriate levels of abstraction
* ACH cannot represent subordinate argumentation, i.e. the argumentation bearing up on a piece of evidence.
* ACH activities at realistic scales leave analysts disoriented or confused.

Van Gelder proposed ''hypothesis mapping'' as an alternative to ACH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=11 December 2012 |last=van Gelder |first=Tim |title=Exploring new directions for intelligence analysis |url=https://timvangelder.com/2012/12/11/exploring-new-directions-for-intelligence-analysis/ |website=timvangelder.com |accessdate=30 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chevallier |first=Arnaud |date=2016 |title=Strategic Thinking in Complex Problem Solving |location=Oxford; New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780190463908 |oclc=940455195 |doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190463908.001.0001 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0DhRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113 113]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structured analysis of competing hypotheses===
The structured analysis of competing hypotheses offers analysts an improvement over the limitations of the original ACH.{{discuss|April 2008}}&lt;ref name=Wheaton2006&gt;{{citation |title=Structured Analysis of Competing Hypotheses: Improving a Tested Intelligence Methodology |journal=Competitive Intelligence Magazine |volume=9 |issue=6 |date=November–December 2006 |pages=12–15 |url=http://www.mcmanis-monsalve.com/assets/publications/intelligence-methodology-1-07-chido.pdf |author=Wheaton |name-list-format=vanc |author2=Kristan J. |display-authors=2 |author3=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt; |access-date=2008-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928154654/http://www.mcmanis-monsalve.com/assets/publications/intelligence-methodology-1-07-chido.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SACH maximizes the possible hypotheses by allowing the analyst to split one hypothesis into two complex ones.

For example, two tested hypotheses could be that Iraq has WMD or Iraq does not have WMD. If the evidence showed that it is more likely there are WMDs in Iraq then two new hypotheses could be formulated: WMD are in Baghdad or WMD are in Mosul. Or perhaps, the analyst may need to know what type of WMD Iraq has; the new hypotheses could be that Iraq has biological WMD, Iraq has chemical WMD and Iraq has nuclear WMD. By giving the ACH structure, the analyst is able to give a nuanced estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Chido |title=Structured Analysis Of Competing Hypotheses: Theory and Application |publisher=[[Mercyhurst College Institute for Intelligence Studies]] Press |year=2006 |page=54 |name-list-format=vanc |author2=Diane E. |display-authors=2 |author3=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other approaches to formalism===
One method, by Valtorta and colleagues uses probabilistic methods, adds [[Bayesian analysis]] to ACH.&lt;ref name=Valtorta&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.cse.sc.edu/~mgv/reports/IA-05.pdf |contribution=Extending Heuer's Analysis of Competing Hypotheses Method to Support Complex Decision Analysis |author=Valtorta, Marco |title=International Conference on Intelligence Analysis Methods and Tools |date=May 2005 |display-authors=1 |author2=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A generalization of this concept to a distributed community of analysts lead to the development of CACHE (the Collaborative ACH Environment),&lt;ref&gt;Shrager, J., et al. (2009) Soccer science and the Bayes community: Exploring the cognitive implications of modern scientific communication. Topics in Cognitive Science, 2(1), 53–72.&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced the concept of a Bayes (or Bayesian) community. The work by Akram and Wang applies paradigms from [[graph theory]].&lt;ref name=Akram2006&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.huitfeldt.com/repository/ITW06.pdf |contribution=Investigative Data Mining: Connecting the dots to disconnect them |pages=28–34 |first1=Shaikh Muhammad |last1=Akram |last2=Wang |first2=Jiaxin |title=Proceedings of the 2006 Intelligence Tools Workshop |date=23 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other work focuses less on probabilistic methods and more on cognitive and visualization extensions to ACH, as discussed by Madsen and Hicks.&lt;ref name=Madsen2006&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.huitfeldt.com/repository/ITW06.pdf |contribution=Investigating the Cognitive Effects of Externalization Tools |pages=4–11 |first1=Fredrik H. |last1=Madsen |first2=David L. |last2=Hicks |title=Proceedings of the 2006 Intelligence Tools Workshop |date=23 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; DECIDE, discussed under [[#Automation|automation]] is visualization-oriented.&lt;ref name=Cluxton2005&gt;{{citation |first1=Diane |last1=Cluxton |first2=Stephen G. |last2=Eick |contribution="DECIDE Hypothesis Visualization Tool" |title=2005 Intl conf on Intelligence Analysis |url=https://analysis.mitre.org/proceedings/Final_Papers_Files/119_Camera_Ready_Paper.pdf |access-date=2008-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807192605/https://analysis.mitre.org/proceedings/Final_Papers_Files/119_Camera_Ready_Paper.pdf |archive-date=2008-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work by Pope and Jøsang uses [[subjective logic]], a formal mathematical methodology that explicitly deals with uncertainty.&lt;ref name=Pope2005&gt;{{citation |id=ADA463908 |title= Analysis of Competing Hypotheses using Subjective Logic (ACH-SL) |publisher=Queensland University, Brisbane, Australia |last1=Pope |first1=Simon |last2=Josang |first2=Audun |date= June 2005 |url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA463908}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This methodology forms the basis of the Sheba technology that is used in Veriluma's intelligence assessment software.

==Automation==
A few online and downloadable tools help automate the ACH process. These programs leave a visual trail of evidence and allow the analyst to weigh evidence.

'''Andrzej Niemojewski''' (24 January 1864 – 3 November 1921) was a Polish social and political activist, [[poet]], [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and writer of the [[Young Poland]] period.

== God Jesus ==

Niemojewski was best known as a proponent of the [[Christ myth theory]]. He was the author of ''Gott Jesus im Lichte fremder und eigener Forschungen samt Darstellung der evangelischen Astralstoffe, Astralszenen und Astralsysteme'' (1910). The book was translated in 1996 as ''God Jesus: The Sun, Moon and Stars as Background to the Gospel Stories'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Niemojenski|first=Andrzej|authorlink=Andrzej Niemojewski|title=Gott jesus in Lichte fremder und eigener Forschungen samt Darstellung der evangelischen Astralstoffe, Astralszenen und Astralsysteme|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CNBGwAACAAJ|volume=1|year=1910|publisher=Huber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Niemojewski|first1=Andrzej|authorlink1=Andrzej Niemojewski|last2=Meuss|first2=Anna|last3=MacDermot|first3=Violet|editor=Violet MacDermot|title=God Jesus: The Sun, Moon and Stars as Background to the Gospel Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giKeAAAACAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Janus Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-85756-264-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Schweitzer]] added two new chapters in the 1913 second edition of his ''[[Quest of the Historical Jesus]]''. (''Geschichte der Leben-Jesu-Forschung'', 2. Auflage, 1913)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2xtnOIhZAmgC&amp;pg=PA451&amp;dq=Schweitzer+bestreitung&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=VcSITOexH8zLswbjrv2mCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Schweitzer%20bestreitung&amp;f=false Albert Schweitzer, ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus'', 2d ed. 1913, Ch. 22, p. 451]&lt;/ref&gt; which features ''God Jesus'' in one chapter.

*Ch. 22, (p.&amp;nbsp;451–499), "The New Denial of the Historicity of Jesus" (''Die Neueste Bestreitung der Geschichtlichkeit Jesu'') analyzes Drews's thesis, plus eight writers in support of [[Arthur Drews|Arthur Drews's]] thesis about the non-existence of Jesus: [[J.

Robertson]], [[Peter Jensen (Orientalist)|Peter Jensen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Peter Christian Albrecht Jensen |title= Hat der Jesus der Evangelien wirklich gelebt?: eine Antwort an Jülicher |year=1910 |publisher= Neuer Frankfurter Verlag |location= Frankfurt am Main |url= http://openlibrary.org/books/OL18686614M/Hat_der_Jesus_der_Evangelien_wirklich_gelebt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrzej Niemojewski, Christian Paul Fuhrmann,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuhrmann |first=Christian Paul |title=Der Astralmythos von Christus: Die Lösung der Christussage durch Astrologie.

Smith]], [[Thomas Whittaker (metaphysician)|Thomas Whittaker]], [[Gerard Bolland|G.J.P.J. Bolland]], [[Samuel Lublinski]]. Three of them favor mythic-astral explanations.

[[Arthur Drews]] featured ''God Jesus'' in his 1926 work, ''[[The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present]]''&amp;nbsp;;&lt;blockquote&gt;A. Niemojewski's main book appeared in 1910.  It also shows a divine Jesus preceding any rumours about a human one.  Contradictions in the Gospel tales prove that they are impossibly about one and the same person -- especially the sayings aren't from a single person.  The sayings are co-opted from Jewish common sources and stuffed into the mouth of the alleged master Jesus.

The most important part of the Gospels, besides the logia, are miracles.  One can't neglect them as the liberal Jesus proponents do, without destroying Christian scripture.  Miracles are proofs for the divinity of Jesus.  Falsely so-called proofs about the human Jesus, like Flavius Josephus, are easily dismissed as chatty hearsays or interpolations.

Niemojewski continues the line of Volney and Dupuis, by looking for parallels in astral mythology.  The Tanakh and Talmud are already full of astral mythological images, like the 12 Jewish tribes and sons of Jacob.  Even more, of course, the New Testament.  This is seen strongest in the Apocalypse of John.  The twin myth, applied to Jesus and John, is especially interesting for Niemojewski.  The constellation of Gemini plays a central role for Niemojewski.  The astral mythological elements are strongest in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke; Mark contains them only quite marginally.

In the end, Niemojewski's system was too confusing to get much consideration, when compared to simpler astral mythical interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drews|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur Drews|title=Die Leugnung der Geschichtlichkeit Jesu in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart. Karlsruhe 1926|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NvMOAAAAQAAJ|year=1926|publisher=G. Braun|language=German|quote=''The Denial of the Historicity of Jesus in Past and Present''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the Appendix of ''[[The Christ Myth#Christ Myth II – the witnesses to the historicity of Jesus (1912)|The Witnesses to the Historicity of Jesus]]'', Drews writes&amp;nbsp;;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we substitute for the “crucified” Orion of the twenty-second psalm the two other important celestial crosses the vernal cross with the Earn (Lamb) and the autumnal cross with the Cup (skull) below it, the Virgin, Berenice's Hair (''megaddela''=Mary Magdalene), etc.—we have all the astral elements of what Niemojewski calls the “astral ''via dolorosa''” (p. 413). May we suppose, in fine, that Orion itself plays the part of the crucified Saviour? In that case the (weeping) women at the cross are represented by the Pleiades (the “rainsisters”), one of which bears the name of Maja (Maria). The Pleiades also are hair-dressers (''megaddela''), as they are represented in medieval manuscripts on the basis of an old tradition,&lt;ref&gt;Boll, ''Spaera'', p. 380. Compare the drawing in Thiele's ''Antike Himmelsbilder'' (1898), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; and they culminate when Berenice's Hair rises above the eastern horizon. Electra is supposed to be the centre of the Pleiades. She is the mother of Jasios (Jesus), and is represented as a mourner with a cloth over her head, just in the same way as the Christian Mary. But as Jasios was also regarded, according to another genealogy, as the son of Maja, the mourning Pleiad may also stand for her. As is known, the mother of Jesus also is a dove (''peleids'', Pleiad) in the early Christian conception. 

According to Niemojewski, the cup (''gulguleth''= skull) represents the heavenly Golgotha. But we may refer it to the skull of the Bull and the head of Medusa, and regard “the place of skulls” as the region of the heavens where Orion is found. On this supposition the two evil-doers are recognised in the Twins, which we have already ascertained to be the astral criminals. Castor is regarded as evil on account of his relation to winter, and Pollux good on account of his relation to summer. Niemojewski sees the two evil-doers in the Dogs (Sirius and Procyon). The difference is not great, as the Dogs culminate at the same time as the Twins, and may therefore be substituted for them. 

Here we have firm ground on which to establish the originally astral and mythical character of the remainder of the story of Jesus, and we seem to have a very strong proof that there was a cult of “the crucified” before the time of Jesus, and that the nucleus of the figure of Jesus is in reality purely astral. 

All the oriental religions, including Judaism, are essentially astral religions. We have previously (p. 223) shown that ''Revelation'' is a Jewish-Gnostic work, the Jesus of which is more primitive than the Jesus of the gospels. But ''Revelation'' is entirely and certainly of an astral character. It is a further proof that Christianity is no exception to the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource

A '''biodiversity hotspot''' is a [[Biogeography|biogeographic region]] with significant levels of [[biodiversity]] that is threatened with destruction. For example forests are considered as biodiversity hotspots.The Status is designated by Conservation International. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bsienvis.nic.in/Database/Biodiversity-Hotspots-in-India_20500.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.conservation.org/How/Pages/Hotspots.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norman Myers]] wrote about the concept in two articles in “The Environmentalist” (1988),&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N. The Environmentalist 8 187-208 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; &amp; 1990&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N. The Environmentalist 10 243-256 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; revised after thorough analysis by Myers and others “Hotspots: Earth’s Biologically Richest and Most Endangered Terrestrial Ecoregions”&lt;ref&gt;Russell A. Mittermeier, Norman Myers and Cristina Goettsch Mittermeier, ''Hotspots: Earth's Biologically Richest and Most Endangered Terrestrial Ecoregions,'' Conservation International, 2000 {{ISBN|978-968-6397-58-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a paper published in the journal ''Nature''.&lt;ref name="MyersMittermeier2000"/&gt;

To qualify as a biodiversity hotspot on Myers 2000 edition of the hotspot-map, a region must meet two strict criteria: it must contain at least 0.5% or 1,500 species of [[vascular plant]]s as [[Endemism|endemics]], and it has to have lost at least 70% of its primary vegetation.&lt;ref name="MyersMittermeier2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myers|first1=Norman|last2=Mittermeier|first2=Russell A.|last3=Mittermeier|first3=Cristina G.|last4=da Fonseca|first4=Gustavo A.

==Hotspot conservation initiatives==
Only a small percentage of the total land area within biodiversity hotspots is now protected. Several international organizations are working in many ways to conserve biodiversity hotspots.
* [[Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund]] (CEPF) is a global program that provides funding and technical assistance to nongovernmental organizations and participation to protect the Earth's richest regions of plant and animal diversity including: biodiversity hotspots, high-biodiversity wilderness areas and important marine regions.
* The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] has derived a system called the "[[Global 200|Global 200 Ecoregions]]", the aim of which is to select priority Ecoregions for conservation within each of 14 terrestrial, 3 freshwater, and 4 marine habitat types. They are chosen for their species richness, endemism, taxonomic uniqueness, unusual ecological or evolutionary phenomena, and global rarity. All biodiversity hotspots contain at least one Global 200 Ecoregion.
* [[Birdlife International]] has identified 218 “[[Endemic Bird Areas]]” (EBAs) each of which hold two or more bird species found nowhere else. Birdlife International has identified more than 11,000 Important Bird Areas&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sites/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808183125/http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sites/index.html |date=August 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; all over the world.
* [[Plant life International]] coordinates several the world aiming to identify [[Important Plant Areas]].
* [[Alliance for Zero Extinction]] is an initiative of a large number of scientific organizations and conservation groups who co-operate to focus on the most threatened endemic species of the world. They have identified 595 sites, including a large number of Birdlife’ s Important Bird Areas.
* The [[National Geographic Society]] has prepared a world map&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/Documents/cihotspotmap.pdf |title=Conservation International |publisher=The Biodiversity Hotspots |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2012-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327075212/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/Documents/cihotspotmap.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the hotspots and ArcView shapefile and metadata for the Biodiversity Hotspots&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/Documents/hotspots_revisited_2004.zip |title=Conservation International |publisher=The Biodiversity Hotspots |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2012-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320054336/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/Documents/hotspots_revisited_2004.zip |archivedate=2012-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including details of the individual endangered fauna in each hotspot, which is available from [[Conservation International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/resources/pages/maps.aspx |title=Resources |publisher=Biodiversityhotspots.org |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2012-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324024634/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/resources/pages/maps.aspx |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critiques of "Hotspots"'''

The high profile of the biodiversity hotspots approach has resulted in some criticism. Papers such as Kareiva &amp; Marvier (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Kareiva, P. and M. Marvier (2003) ''Conserving Biodiversity Coldspots'', [[American Scientist]], 91, 344-351.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} have argued that the biodiversity hotspots:
* Do not adequately represent other forms of species richness (e.g. total species richness or threatened species richness).
* Do not adequately represent taxa other than vascular plants (e.g. vertebrates, or fungi).
* Do not protect smaller scale richness hotspots.
* Do not make allowances for changing [[land use]] patterns. Hotspots represent regions that have experienced considerable habitat loss, but this does not mean they are experiencing ongoing habitat loss. On the other hand, regions that are relatively intact (e.g. the [[Amazon Basin]]) have experienced relatively little [[land loss]], but are currently losing habitat at tremendous rates.
* Do not protect [[ecosystem services]].
* Do not consider [[phylogenetic diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daru | first1 = Barnabas H. | last2 = van der Bank | first2 = Michelle | last3 = Davies | first3 = T.

A recent series of papers has pointed out that biodiversity hotspots (and many other priority region sets) do not address the concept of cost.&lt;ref&gt;Possingham, H. and K. Wilson (2005) ''Turning up the heat on hotspots'', [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], 436, 919-920.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of biodiversity hotspots is not simply to identify regions that are of high biodiversity value, but to prioritize conservation spending. The regions identified include some in the developed world (e.g. the [[California Floristic Province]]), alongside others in the developing world (e.g. [[Madagascar]]). The cost of land is likely to vary between these regions by an order of magnitude or more, but the biodiversity hotspot designations do not consider the conservation importance of this difference. However, the available resources for conservation also tend to vary in this way.

'''Black suffrage''' is  [[Black people]]'s [[right to vote]]. Black suffrage has been at issue in countries established under conditions of [[white supremacy]]. It may be limited through official or informal (''[[de facto]]'') discrimination. In many places, black people have obtained suffrage through national independence. It should also be pointed out that "Black suffrage" in the [[United States]] in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]] explicitly refers to "Black Male Suffrage".  While women citizens, regardless of race, held rights to vote in some states, at the federal level, the U.S. Constitution was not interpreted to prohibit discrimination against women in voting, regardless of their race, until the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]] which was ratified by the [[United States Congress]] on August 18 and then certified by law on August 26, 1920.

==British Empire and United Kingdom==

* Beginning in [[Simon de Montfort's Parliament|1265]], a small number of landed aristocrats and gentry had the right to vote for members of the [[Parliament of England]] and Knights of the Shire. From 1432, only [[forty-shilling freeholders]] held the parliamentary franchise. Suffrage was restricted to males by custom rather than statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The History of the Parliamentary Franchise|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP13-14|publisher=House of Commons Library|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=1 March 2013|chapter=Ancient voting rights|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Olaudah Equiano]] and the [[London Corresponding Society]] (founded 1792) argued for expanded suffrage. ''Also see:'' [[Radicalism (historical)]].
* The [[Reform Act 1832]] extended the vote to landed middle class men.
**Incremental reform continued with various [[Reform Act]]s, 
**The [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] ended property qualification for male suffrage.
**The [[Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928|Equal Suffrage Act 1928]] ended property qualifications for female suffrage.
*Citizens of [[Crown colony|Crown Colonies]] did not have the right to vote for the government of the British Empire. 
**[[History of Jamaica#British rule: 1655.E2.80.931962|Colonial Jamaica]] sometimes had partial privileges to elect leaders. The [[Constitution of Jamaica]] provides for partial voting rights.
**The British monarchy appointed all leaders of [[Sierra Leone#Colonial era|Colonial Sierra Leone]] until 1953; the [[Sierra Leonean general election, 1962]] was the country's first election with universal suffrage. 
**The [[West Indies Federation]] (1958–1962) was slated to become autonomous but never did; a number of its member states have since achieved autonomy.
* The [[British Nationality Act 1981]] provides [[Commonwealth citizen]]s with legal voting rights.

==South Africa==
{{Further|Black South African}}

===Cape Colony===
* The [[Cape Qualified Franchise]] restricted voting by property ownership but not explicitly by race.
**In 1853, the Queen authorized a Cape Colony parliament, which drafted a [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope#Representative Government .281853.29|Constitution]] with no explicit racial restriction.
**Cape Colony's "[[Responsible Government#Cape Colony|Responsible Government]]" Constitution, issued in 1872, explicitly prohibited racial discrimination.
**Under Prime Minister [[Gordon Sprigg]], the Colony passed the 1877 "Registration Bill", disenfranchising Black communal land owners.
**The [[Franchise and Ballot Act]] of 1892 raised the threshold for suffrage from £25 to £75, accomplishing ''de facto'' disenfranchisement of many non-White voters

===South Africa===
* The [[Representation of Natives Act, 1936]] moved Black South Africans onto separate voter rolls
* [[Apartheid in South Africa]] refers to a period of heavily legislated [[white supremacy]] during which Black suffrage was heavily restricted.
** The [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis]] in the 1950s originated with the [[Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951]], an attempt to revoke suffrage for [[Coloured]] voters. The [[Separate Representation of Voters Amendment Act, 1968]] fully revoked Coloured representation in Parliament, creating the distinct [[Coloured Persons Representative Council]].
** The [[Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act, 1959]] ended Black representation in Parliament through the creation of [[Bantustan]]s; Black citizenship was transferred fully to Bantustans by the [[Bantu Homelands Citizenship Act, 1970]] 
** South Africa's [[South African Constitution of 1983|1983 Constitution]], approved by the White-only [[South African constitutional reform referendum, 1983|constitutional reform referendum]], created the [[Tricameral Parliament]], giving representation in separate Chambers to Coloured and [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] voters. Coloured voters were represented in the House of Representatives of South Africa.
* The [[South African Constitution of 1993]], also known as the Interim Constitution, provided for the [[South African general election, 1994]]: the first South African election with [[Universal suffrage]] for adults. The date—27 April—is celebrated as a national holiday called "[[Freedom Day (South Africa)|Freedom Day]]".
* The current [[Constitution of South Africa]], adopted in 1997, protects all citizens' right to vote in [[Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa|Chapter Two]].

===Namibia===
* Germany took official control in 1884; it was known as [[German South-West Africa]]. German sovereignty was contested by the [[Khaua-Mbandjeru Rebellion]] and the [[Herero Wars]], which were brutally suppressed.
* South Africa [[South-West Africa Campaign|gained control]] of the area during World War I. It eventually governed [[South-West Africa]] under apartheid laws and divided the area into ten bantustans.
** Many residents recognized [[SWAPO]], not South Africa, as the legitimate authority.  The United Nations recognized SWAPO as Namibia's legitimate representative in 1972.
** The 22-year [[Namibian War of Independence]] culminated in the [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|New York Accords]] of 1988, leading to Namibia's first free election in November 1989.
* The [[Constitution of Namibia]], adopted in 1990, provides in Article 28 for "direct, universal and equal suffrage".

**[[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s sought an end to slavery, and many demanded further rights such as suffrage.
**''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857) held that persons of African descent were not citizens of the U.S.
**Black suffrage was proposed and defeated in the [[New York state election, 1860]].
* During the [[Reconstruction Era]], the U.S. Congress passed laws favoring Black suffrage; in practice, Blacks still faced obstacles to voting.
** Some of the "[[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]]" passed shortly after the legal abolition of slavery explicitly prevented Blacks from voting. Most of these laws were repealed or invalidated.
** The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], adopted in 1870, stipulates: "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude."
** The [[Enforcement Acts]] increased federal penalties for voter intimidation, particularly by White terrorist groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref&gt;Everette Swinney, "Enforcing the Fifteenth Amendment, 1870–1877." ''Journal of Southern History'' 28#2 (1962): 202–218. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2205188] &lt;/ref&gt;
*** The 1873 [[Colfax massacre]] occurred when White locals fought with Blacks and federal troops over Black voting in Grant Parish, Louisiana.
*** In ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876), the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated some of the Enforcement Acts, ruling that the federal government could only intervene to prevent discrimination by [[state actor]]s
** In ''[[United States v. Reese]]'' (1876), the Court upheld voting requirements such as [[literacy test]]s which do not explicitly discriminate on the basis of race.
* [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era]] (''Also see'' [[Jim Crow laws]] ''and'' [[Voting rights in the United States#African Americans and poor whites|Voting rights of African Americans and poor whites]])
** Voting rights were one issue addressed by the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)]].
** Black women did not gain the legal right to vote until passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1920. The [[African-American Woman Suffrage Movement]] focused on the particular challenges faced by Black women, even after the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments. ''Also see:'' [[Mary Church Terrell]].
** A group of Black activists formed the [[Niagara Movement]] in 1905, rebuking the [[Atlanta compromise]] and issuing a Declaration which demanded [[universal manhood suffrage]].
** The [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] formed in 1910 and pursued voting rights mostly through litigation.
** In ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'' (1915), the Supreme Court struck down a grandfather clause which functionally exempted only White people from literacy tests.
** The Court ruled against [[White primaries]] in ''[[Nixon v. Herndon]]'' (1927) and ''[[Nixon v. Condon]]'' (1932), upheld white primaries in ''[[Grovey v. Townsend]]'' (1935) and finally banned them with ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944) and ''[[Terry v. Adams]]'' (1953).
** In ''[[Breedlove v. Suttles]]'' (1937), The Court upheld the constitutionality of a [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] requirement for voting.
**Florida voting rights activists [[Harriette Moore]] and [[Harry T. Moore]] were assassinated by the KKK in 1951.
* The [[Civil Rights Movement]] brought renewed attention to Black voting rights.
** In ''[[Gomillion v. Lightfoot]]'' (1960) the Supreme Court struck down a plan to redraw district lines of Tuskegee, Alabama, on the grounds that it would disenfranchise Black voters.
** The [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], passed in 1962–1964, banned poll taxes as a precondition for voting in federal elections. The Supreme Court ruled against state poll taxes in ''[[Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections]]'' (1966).
**Civil rights leaders began organized [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–1968)#Voter registration organizing|campaigns to register Black voters]], including the federally endorsed [[Voter Education Project]].
** A particularly intense voting rights struggle in Mississippi led to the death of [[Medgar Evers]] in 1963 and the [[Freedom Summer]] campaign in 1964. Organizers also created the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] to challenge the White-dominated Mississippi Democratic Party. ''Also see:'' [[Council of Federated Organizations]]'.
** In Alabama, the highly publicized [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] in 1965 met with a violent response, bringing more scrutiny to suppression of Black voters.
** The [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] prohibited a range of discriminatory state voting practices.The Supreme Court upheld this law in ''[[South Carolina v. Katzenbach]]'' (1966).
** Malcolm X delivered his "[[The Ballot or the Bullet]]" speech in 1964.
* Contemporary issues relating to voting rights and [[disenfranchisement]] of Black Americans:
** The practice of [[gerrymandering]] and the creation of [[List of majority minority United States congressional districts|"majority minority" districts]] have sometimes been identified as threats to Black voting rights in the U.S.
***The Supreme Court limits the 1960 ''Gomillion'' decision in ''[[Mobile v. Bolden]]'' (1980), distinguishing between racist effects and racist intent, and prohibiting only the latter.
***The Court ruled in ''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'' (1993) that if a redistricting plan is "so bizarre on its face that it is 'unexplainable on grounds other than race'", it must be held to a "strict scrutiny" standard under the Fourteenth Amendment.
*** The Court has since struck down redistricting plans for racial gerrymandering in ''[[Miller v. Johnson]]'' (1995), ''[[Bush v. Vera]]'' (1996), and several more cases. ''See: [[:Category:United States electoral redistricting case law]]''.
** The film ''[[American Blackout]]'' alleges that disenfranchisement of Black voters in Georgia led to the defeat of Cynthia McKinney in DeKalb County's [[Cynthia McKinney#2002 primary defeat|2002 Democratic primary]].
** The Supreme Court struck down part of the Voting Rights Act in ''[[Shelby County v. Holder]]'' (2013), holding that the racist practices which necessitated the law in 1965 no longer present a problem in 2013.

==France==
* Before the Revolution, only some local elections were held, the first real national suffrage appeared in 1791. 
* From 1791, France installed several male suffrage system, alternating between census and universal suffrage. In mainland France, there was no racial criterion to be a voter so technically from this date, Black (male) voters existed and received the same rights as non-Blacks. They were still rare as segregation on France was not based directly on skin color or racialism but on the status as a slave or as a free human. Later it would be based on status as a mainland citizen or as a colony citizen.
* From there, through the first half of the 19th century, frequent changes in the national government caused the colonies (where most slaves were, as their presence was restricted in mainland France) to have different rules than mainland France, often illegally. Several uprising occurred in the colonies during this period and the colonial rules diverged considerably from mainland France.
* In mainland France:
** In 1794 the government abolished slavery.
** In 1802 Napoleon Bonaparte re-established slavery and, possibly owing to his disagreements with [[Thomas-Alexandre Dumas]], a black general, forbade Blacks and people of mixed-ancestry (''mulâtres'') to enter mainland France.
** In 1815 slave trade was abolished, but not slavery
** In 1848 slavery is formally abolished in France and all slaves are freed.
* In the [[French Colonial Empire]], however, most indigenous people were not recognized as full French citizens and therefore often did not have the right to vote: 
**[[Vincent Ogé]], who had been working in Paris during the Revolution, returned to the island slave colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] and demanded voting rights. Ogé led an insurrection in 1790 and was executed in 1791. Enslaved people took control of the island in the subsequent [[Haitian Revolution|Revolution]] and established the Republic of [[Haiti]]. (Elections were held but [[History of Haiti#Independence: The early years .281804.E2.80.931843.29|the democracy was not stable]].)
**France promoted a [[Assimilation (French colonial)|model of assimilation]] according to which Blacks and indigenous people could gain voting (and other) rights by successfully conforming to French culture. These high-status Blacks were known as ''les [[Évolué]]es''.
** People living in French colonies primarily fell under the ''[[Code de l'indigénat]]''. ''Les'' ''indigènes'' had some voting privileges, but these could be modified without their consent.
**Following the Revolution of 1848, France granted limited representation to the [[Four Communes]] of Senegal. Ordinary residents of these cities gained full voting rights in 1916 after the election of [[Blaise Diagne]].
** [[Lamine Guèye]] (another Senegalese politician) also achieved expanded voting rights ("''loi Lamine Guèye''") for people in the colonies.
**Residents of African colonies were permitted to vote in the [[French constitutional referendum, 1958]], which established the [[French Community]]. Most colonies voted for independence, resulting in the creation of 17 Black nations in the [[Year of Africa]].

==Belgian Congo==
* Blacks in the Belgian Congo voted for the first time in [[Belgian Congo#Political Organization|municipal elections of 1957]].
* The first nationwide election was the [[Belgian Congo general election, 1960]]. ''See also:'' [[Mouvement National Congolais]]
* The assassination of elected President Patrice Lumumba led to years of crisis followed by the Zaire dictatorship. The next free, multi-party election was the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo general election, 2006]].

'''Carl "Charlie" Brandt''' (February 23, 1957 &amp;ndash; September 13, 2004) was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]]. A former resident of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]] and longtime resident of the [[Florida Keys]], Brandt committed suicide in September 2004 after he stabbed his wife, Teresa "Teri" Brandt, and [[decapitation|decapitated]] and severely mutilated his [[niece]], Michelle Jones, by removing her heart. An investigation by police concluded that Brandt hanged himself in Jones' garage after committing the murders.

It later came to light that Brandt had shot his parents &amp;ndash; his pregnant mother fatally &amp;ndash; in 1971, when he was 13; he spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released, and was never criminally charged. Because of this incident, and because of Brandt's efficiency in killing his wife and niece and his hidden obsession with [[human anatomy]], investigators looked into the prospect that he had committed other murders since moving to Florida in 1973. Police have positively ascribed up to six homicides to Brandt.

== Early life ==
Brandt was the second child and only son of Herbert and Ilse Brandt, two [[German people|German]] immigrants who originally lived in [[Connecticut]]. His father worked as a laborer for a division of [[International Harvester]], eventually working his way up to draftsman and project engineer. However, the family frequently moved, and as a result, Brandt and his older sister Angela attended several different schools. He was regarded as a good student, but was shy and had difficulty adjusting to new surroundings. In September 1968, Herbert was transferred to International Harvester's plant in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]]. Every summer and Christmas, the family would vacation in [[Florida]], where Brandt went on hunting trips with his father.

== 1971 incident ==
On the night of January 3, 1971, Brandt, then 13, walked into his parents' bathroom while Herbert was shaving and Ilse, who was eight months pregnant, was taking a bath. Brandt shot both parents at point blank range; his father survived, but his mother died at the scene. Brandt then confronted his sister Angela, but his gun wouldn't fire. After a physical struggle, Angela managed to calm her brother down before she fled the house and sought help from neighbors. Brandt also left the house and knocked on the door of a girl next door named Sandi Radcliffe, telling her, "Sandi, I just shot my mom and dad." Herbert Brandt later identified his son as his attacker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18559_162-1655084.html?pageNum=3 Deadly Obsession] Page 3, CBS News, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Because he was too young to be charged with murder under Indiana law, Brandt appeared before a [[grand jury]] and was ordered to undergo three separate [[psychiatric evaluation]]s, all of which couldn't determine what motivated him to shoot his parents. One of Brandt's psychiatrists, Ronald Pancner, later recounted, "Basically, I was looking for [[mental illness]]. And he wasn't showing the signs and symptoms of serious mental illness, which I thought was what the court wanted to know." Interviews with Brandt's family and friends showed that he had no conflicts at home or at school, and had previously shown nothing but devotion to his mother. Brandt spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released back into the custody of his family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18559_162-1655084.html?pageNum=4 Deadly Obsession] Page 4, CBS News, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; They never spoke of the incident again, and Brandt's younger sisters were never told about the shooting.

== 2004 incident ==
Shortly after Brandt's release, his family relocated to Florida. One year later, Brandt's father and sisters moved away after he remarried, while Brandt himself remained in Florida under the care of his grandparents. In 1984, Brandt got a degree on electronics and became a radar specialist. In 1986, he married his girlfriend Teri. No relatives were invited to their wedding. The couple settled in a beach house of [[Big Pine Key]], the southernmost portion of the [[Florida Keys]], in 1989. 

On September 2, 2004, Brandt and Teri evacuated from their home ahead of [[Hurricane Ivan]]. Their niece, Michelle Lynn Jones, invited them to stay at her residence in near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. Throughout the visit, Jones kept in regular contact with her mother, Mary Lou, as well as several friends. On the evening of September 13, one of Jones' friends, Lisa Emmons, was scheduled to visit her house. However, Jones discouraged her from coming after reporting that the Brandts had an argument after drinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18559_162-1655084.html?pageNum=2 Deadly Obsession] Page 2, CBS News, 25 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; After that night, Jones stopped answering telephone calls, which alarmed her acquaintances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlj-foundation.org/history.html History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021051320/http://mlj-foundation.org/history.html# |date=2013-10-21 }}, Michelle Lynn Jones Foundation. Retrieved 2 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, another one of Jones' friends, Debbie Knight, came to her house to check on her while on the phone with Jones' mother. After finding the front door locked, Knight tried to enter the house through the garage, where she found Brandt's [[human decomposition|decomposing]] body hanging from the rafters. Knight contacted the police, who entered the house and found the bodies of Brandt's wife and niece. Teri had been stabbed seven times in the chest while reclining on a couch. Jones had been [[decapitation|decapitated]] and [[disembowelment|disemboweled]], with her [[human heart|heart]] and [[human organs|organs]] removed. Jones' head was also placed next to her own body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsvn.com/features/articles/investigations/MI20479/ 7 News Investigations: Killer Connection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109150114/http://www.wsvn.com/features/articles/investigations/MI20479/ |date=January 9, 2011 }}, WSVN-TV, 15 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The weapons used in the crimes had been knives from Jones' kitchen.

== Investigation ==
A search of Brandt's residence on Big Pine Key revealed that he was a monthly subscriber to [[Victoria's Secret]] [[Trade literature|catalog]]s; had an extensive collection of surgery-themed books, posters, and clippings; and regularly searched online for autopsy photos and [[snuff film]] websites depicting violence against women. Because Brandt's murder of Jones indicated methodology and past experience, and because he traveled often due to his job, police checked [[cold case]]s in Florida that matched his apparent ''[[modus operandi]]'', and launched requests for similar inquiries in the United States and abroad. Ultimately, the search linked Brandt to twenty-six unsolved murders in Florida dating back to 1973.

* '''Carol Sullivan, 1978:''' Sullivan, aged 12, was abducted from a school bus stop in [[Volusia County]] on September 20, 1978. Her skull was found inside a bucket, leading authorities to presume she was murdered and decapitated. Brandt was 20 years old and lived in Volusia County at the time, but could not be tied to the crime in any other way. 
* '''Lisa Saunders, 1988:''' Saunders, aged 20, was beaten, stabbed, and dragged from her car in Big Pine Key in December 1988. Her heart was missing when she was found, but it is unclear if it was extracted by an attacker or eaten by vultures. 
* '''Sherry Perisho, 1989:''' Perisho's partially-clothed body was found on July 16, 1989, near the North Pine Channel Bridge at Big Pine Key, where Perisho, who was homeless, lived on a [[dinghy]]. Her throat had been slashed and her head had been nearly severed; like Jones, her body was extensively mutilated and her heart was removed. Perisho was found less than 1,000 feet from where Brandt lived, and Brandt matched a [[composite sketch]] of a man seen crossing [[U.S. Route 1]] near where Perisho was discovered on the night she was murdered. Based on this evidence, [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]] investigators determined that Brandt killed Perisho and officially closed the case on May 6, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-05-06/news/MBRANDT06_1_brandt-monroe-county-seminole Killer tied to '89 death -- wife suspected him all along], ''The Orlando Sentinel'', 6 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Darlene Toler, 1995:''' Toler was a [[prostitute]] from [[Miami]] whose body, missing her head and heart, was found near a highway wrapped in plastic. Brandt used the same highway regularly and he kept a mileage record of his travels, which shows an entry for 100 miles {{ndash}} the driving distance between Big Pine Key and Miami {{ndash}} on the day of her murder.

A '''chord diagram''' is a graphical method of displaying the inter-relationships between data in a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. The data are arranged radially around a circle with the relationships between the data points typically drawn as arcs connecting the data.

The format can be aesthetically pleasing, making it a popular choice in the world of [[data visualization]].

== Name ==

Chord diagrams get their name from terminology used in [[geometry]]. A [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] of a circle is a geometric line segment whose endpoints both lie on the circle. Chord diagrams are also known as '''radial network diagrams''' and may sometimes be referred to as a type of [[circular layout]].

== Hierarchical edge bundling ==
While a small amount of data could be represented in a circular diagram using straight lines to show the interconnections, a diagram featuring numerous lines would quickly become illegible. 
To reduce the visual complexity, chord diagrams employ a technique called [[hierarchical edge bundling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2577">In [[probability]] and [[statistics]], a '''circular distribution''' or '''polar distribution''' is a [[probability distribution]] of a [[random variable]] whose values are angles, usually taken to be in the range {{nowrap|{{Not a typo|[0, 2''π'')}}.}}&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dodge |first=Y. |year=2006 |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms |publisher=OUP |isbn=0-19-920613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A circular distribution is often a [[continuous probability distribution]], and hence has a [[probability density function|probability density]], but such distributions can also be [[discrete probability distribution|discrete]], in which case they are called '''circular lattice distributions'''.&lt;ref name=D/&gt; Circular distributions can be used even when the variables concerned are not explicitly angles: the main consideration is that there is not usually any real distinction between events occurring at the lower or upper end of the range, and the division of the range could notionally be made at any point.

==Graphical representation==

If a circular distribution has a density

:&lt;math&gt;p(\phi)   \qquad  \qquad (0\le\phi&lt;2\pi),\,&lt;/math&gt;

it can be graphically represented as a closed [[curve]]

:&lt;math&gt;[x(\phi),y(\phi)] = [r(\phi)\cos\phi, \, r(\phi)\sin\phi], \, &lt;/math&gt;

where the radius &lt;math&gt;r(\phi)\,&lt;/math&gt; is set equal to
:&lt;math&gt;r(\phi) = a+b p(\phi), \, &lt;/math&gt;

and where ''a'' and ''b'' are chosen on the basis of appearance.

==Example==

By computing the probability distribution of angles along a handwritten ink trace,
a lobe-shaped polar distribution emerges. The main direction of the lobe in the
first quadrant corresponds to the [[slant (handwriting)|slant]] of handwriting (see: [[graphonomics]]).

An example of a circular lattice distribution would be the probability of being born in a given month of the year, with each calendar month being thought of as arranged round a circle, so that "January" is next to "December".

The '''clerical script''' ({{zh|t=隸書|s=隶书|p=lìshū|first=t}}; Japanese: 隷書体, ''reishotai''; Vietnamese: lệ thư), also formerly [[Chancery hand|chancery]] script, is an archaic [[Chinese script styles|style]] of [[Chinese calligraphy]] which evolved from the [[Warring States period]] to the [[Qin dynasty]], was dominant in the [[Han dynasty]], and remained in use through the [[Cao Wei|Wei]]-[[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;As discussed and referenced below, proto-clerical emerged in [[Warring States]] to [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]]; it is also widely known that clerical matured in the early Han. Although popularly associated only with the Han dynasty, clerical actually remained in use alongside cursive, neo-clerical, and semi-cursive scripts until ''after'' the Wei-Jin period, when the modern [[regular script|standard script]] became dominant; see Qiu 2000, p.113&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its high legibility to modern readers, it is still used for artistic flavor in a variety of functional applications such as headlines, signboards, and advertisements. This legibility stems from the highly rectilinear structure, a feature shared with modern [[Regular script|regular script (kaishu)]]. In structure and rectilinearity, it is generally similar to the modern script; however, in contrast with the tall to square modern script, it tends to be square to wide, and often has a pronounced, wavelike flaring of isolated major strokes, especially a dominant rightward or downward diagonal stroke. Some structures are also archaic.

==Origins==

Clerical script is popularly but mistakenly thought to have developed or been invented in the early [[Han dynasty]] from the [[Small_Seal_Script|small seal script]]. The process of change between small seal script and clerical script is referred to as the ''Libian'' (lit: Clerical Evolution) (隸變).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zdic.net/c/6/104/279737.htm Definition of 隸變: 文字學上指篆書改寫成隸書的經過。隸變過的形體，往往與原篆意有明顯差異。例如：篆書「󹡨」隸定成「秊」；隸變成「年」。隸定字仍可窺測出篆體的結構，隸變字則未必。&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also historical traditions dating to the Hàn dynasty which mistakenly attributed the creation of clerical script to the Qín dynasty and in particular to Chéng Miǎo, who was said to have invented it at the behest of [[Qin Shi Huang]].&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.103, esp. footnote 28. Qiu cites Caì Yōng as saying: "Cheng Miao got rid of ancient (script) and established the clerical script forms".&lt;/ref&gt; Another traditional account is that it was invented by government scribes, in particular those involved in the justice and penal systems.&lt;ref&gt;This is the version given in the Hanshu, acc. to Táng Lán (唐蘭) 1979.《中國文字學》（上海：上海古籍出版社）。Zhōnggúo Wénzìxué (Chinese Linguistics). Shànghǎi Gǔjí Publishing, p.165, and Qiu 2000, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; However, from written materials unearthed by archaeologists, it is now known that ''all'' stages of Chinese writing underwent periods of natural evolution, and none of them were inventions by one person; this is true of clerical script as well.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, rather than being established by government scribes, it has been argued that clerical script was already in popular use, and the Qín dynasty use by scribes merely reflects this trend.&lt;ref&gt;Táng Lán 1979, p.165, cited in Qiu 2000, p.107; this does not, however, preclude influence by those scribes and even Cheng Miao in the process; as Qiu notes, Cheng Miao may have played a role in systematizing the script, thus leading to the mistaken tradition of his inventing it (Qiu p.107), much as Li Si's standardization of the already extant small seal script led to misperceptions that he had invented it.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological discoveries now clearly show that an immature form of clerical script ("proto-clerical") was already developing in the state of Qín during the Warring States period,&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000; p.59 &amp; p.104&lt;/ref&gt; and into the early Western Hàn; this can be seen on a number of [[bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo books]] unearthed recently.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.108&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the writing immediately preceding clerical script was not merely seal script alone; rather, there was a coexistence of seal script (the at-first dominant and formal style) alongside an increasingly popular but secondary form of "vulgar", "popular", or "common" writing, which was very roughly executed and which was generally rectilinear.&lt;ref name="Qiu 2000, p.104"&gt;Qiu 2000, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of this vulgar writing grew as the use of writing itself became more widespread.&lt;ref name="Qiu 2000, p.104"/&gt; The structures and style of many of the characters executed in this vulgar writing were similar or even identical to their later clerical script counterparts,&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.104-5; others were similar or identical to the forms of cursive script and were instrumental in its formation -- Qiu p.108-9&lt;/ref&gt; leading some to conclude that proto-clerical (and therefore clerical) script evolved not from seal script but from the vulgar writing of Qín, which coexisted with seal script in Warring States to Qín dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.107&lt;/ref&gt; The Qín bamboo script is a good example of this transition, having evolved from vulgar Qín writing and considered by some to constitute Qín clerical script.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.104-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The etymology of the Chinese name for the script lìshū ({{zh|t=隸書|s=隶书}}) is uncertain. ''Lì'' meant a slave or prisoner serving the state, and thus, some infer that the script was used in recording the affairs related to such slaves, while others infer that it was used by prisoners conscripted as scribes.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu 2000, p.111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and further evolution==
During Warring States, proto-clerical script emerged in casual, informal usage. During the Qin dynasty it appears to have also been used in some scribal capacity, but never in formal usage. Maturing into clerical script in the early Han, it soon became the dominant script for general purposes, while seal script remained in use for the most formal purposes such as some [[Stele#China|stelae]], signet seals (name chops), and especially the titles of written works and stelae; some [[Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive]] was also in use at the time.&lt;ref name="Qiu 2000, p.113"&gt;Qiu 2000, p.113&lt;/ref&gt; At roughly the same time, the clerical script was used and inscribed onto many stelae which later influenced subsequent development of Chinese calligraphic styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vincentpoon.com/the-stele-of-mount-hua-temple-at-the-west-alp.html|title=The Stele of Mount Hua Temple at The West Alp|website=Vincent's Calligraphy|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of clerical script, a new form then emerged in the middle of the Eastern Han dynasty, which Qiu (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;113) terms "neo-clerical" script; it was from this neo-clerical and from cursive that by late in the Eastern Han [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]] would then evolve, out of which then emerged the modern standard script. Thus, according to Qiu, the evolution from clerical script to standard script was not a direct step as commonly supposed.&lt;ref name="Qiu 2000, p.113"/&gt;

[[File:Codex Totomixtlahuaca WDL2701.png|thumb|Codex Totomixtlahuaca]]
The '''Codex Totomixtlahuaca''' or '''Codex Condumex''' is a colonial-era map produced on a large piece of [[cotton]]. The map represents Totomixlahuaca, [[Mexico]], and includes a creation date of 1564. It documents a meeting over a land conflict in communities of the current Mexican state of [[Guerrero]].

== Description ==
The ''Codex Totomixtlahuaca'' was found in the community of Totomixtlahuaca, located in the southeast of Guerrero, in [[Mexico]]. Using Aztec [[pictogram|pictographs]], the map represents the distribution of lands in 1564.&lt;ref name="wdl" /&gt;

== Preparation ==
The map was drawn on a large piece of cotton, roughly 217&amp;nbsp;cm by 185&amp;nbsp;cm. It was painted with coal.&lt;ref name="cehm" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6597">'''Culture change''' is a term used in [[public policy]] making that emphasizes the influence of [[cultural capital]] on individual and community behavior. It has been sometimes called repositioning of culture,&lt;Ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13668803.2014.981506&lt;/ref&gt; which means the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chigbu|first1=Uchendu Eugene|title=Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community|journal=Community, Work &amp; Family|date=2015|volume=18|issue=3|pages=334–350|doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13668803.2014.981506}}&lt;/ref&gt; It places stress on the social and cultural capital determinants of decision making and the manner in which these interact with other factors like the availability of information or the financial incentives facing individuals to drive behavior.
[[Image:culture change model.jpg|thumb|Model of culture change]] 

These cultural capital influences include the role of parenting, families and close associates; organizations such as schools and workplaces; communities and neighborhoods; and wider social influences such as the media. It is argued that this cultural capital manifests into specific values, attitudes or social norms which in turn guide the behavioral ''intentions'' that individuals adopt in regard to particular decisions or courses of action. These behavioral intentions interact with other factors driving behavior such as financial incentives, regulation and legislation, or levels of information, to drive actual behavior and ultimately feed back into underlying cultural capital.

In general, cultural stereotypes present great resistance to change and to their own redefinition. Culture, often appears fixed to the observer at any one point in time because cultural mutations occur incrementally.&lt;ref&gt;P.E. Petrakis, P.C. Kostis (2013) “[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053535713000218#! Economic Growth and Cultural Change]”, Journal of Socio-Economics, Issue C, Vol. 47, pp. 147-157, DOI 10.1016/j.socec.2013.02.011.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural change is a long-term process. Policymakers need to make a great effort to improve some basics aspects of a society’s cultural traits.

==Achieving culture change==
The term is used by Knott et al. of the [[Prime Minister's Strategy Unit]] in the publication: ''[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100125070726/http://cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/strategy/assets/achieving_culture_change.pdf Achieving Culture Change: A Policy Framework]'' (Knott et al., 2008). The paper sets out how public policy can achieve social and cultural change through 'downstream' interventions including fiscal incentives, legislation, regulation and information provision and also 'upstream' interventions such as parenting, peer and mentoring programs, or development of social and community networks.

The key concepts the paper is based on include:

* ''Cultural capital'' - such as the attitudes, values, aspirations and sense of self-efficacy which influence behavior. Cultural capital is itself influenced by behavior over time
* The shifting ''social zeitgeist'' - whereby social norms and values that predominate within the cultural capital in society evolve in over time
* The process by which political narrative and new ideas and innovations shift the social zeitgeist over time within the constraint of the 'elastic band' of public opinion
* The process of ''behavioral normalization'' - whereby behavior and actions pass through into social and cultural norms (for example, Knott et al. argue that the UK experience of seat belt enforcement established and reinforced this as a social norm)
* The use of [[customer insight]]
* The importance of tailoring policy programmes around an ecological model of human behavior to account for how policy will interact with cultural capital and affect it over time

Knott et al. use examples from a range of policy areas to demonstrate how the culture change framework can be applied to policymaking. For example:

* To encourage educational aspiration they recommend more use of early years and parenting interventions, an improved childhood offer, and development of positive narratives on education as well as integrated advisory systems, financial assistance and targeted social marketing approaches.
* To promote healthy living and personal responsibility they recommend building healthy living into community infrastructure, building partnerships with schools and employers, more one-to-one support for wellbeing alongside use of regulation and legislation on unhealthy products, provision of robust health information and health marketing to promote adaptive forms of behaviour.
* To develop environmentally sustainable norms they recommend reinforcing sustainability throughout policy narratives, using schools and the voluntary sector to promote environmental messages, development of infrastructure that make sustainable choices easy, together with a wider package of measures on fiscal incentives, regulation, advisory services and coalition movements.

== Privacy Types ==

=== Information Privacy ===
''Main article: [[Information privacy|Information Privacy]]''

In the context of digital privacy, [[information privacy]] is the notion that individuals should have the freedom, or right, to determine how their digital information, mainly that pertaining to [[personally identifiable information]], is collected and used. The [[European Union|EU]] has various [[Privacy law|laws]] that dictate how information may be collected and used by companies. Some of those laws are written to give agency to the preferences of individuals/consumers in how their data is used. In other places, like in the United States, [[privacy law]] is argued by some to be less developed in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/uoltj2&amp;div=18&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Privacy Law in the United States, the EU and Canada: The Allure of the Middle Ground 2 University of Ottawa Law &amp; Technology Journal 2005|last=|first=|date=|website=heinonline.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By example, some legislation, or lack of, allows companies to self-regulate their collection and dissemination practices of consumer information. 

=== Communication Privacy ===
In the context of digital privacy, communication privacy is the notion that individuals should have the freedom, or right, to communicate information digitally with the expectation that their communications are secure; meaning that messages and communications will only be accessible to the sender's original intended recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hung|first=Humphry|last2=Wong|first2=Y.H.|date=2009-05-22|title=Information transparency and digital privacy protection: are they mutually exclusive in the provision of e‐services?|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/08876040910955161|journal=Journal of Services Marketing|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=154–164|doi=10.1108/08876040910955161|issn=0887-6045}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, communications can be [[Secure communication|intercepted]] or delivered to other recipients without the sender's knowledge, in a multitude of ways. Communications can be intercepted directly through various hacking methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sushmitha|first=R.|date=|title=HACKING METHODS, TECHNIQUES AND THEIR PREVENTION|url=http://www.researchpublish.com/download.php?file=HACKING%20METHODS%20TECHNIQUES%20AND%20THEIR%20PREVENTION-256.pdf&amp;act=book|journal=International Journal of Computer SCience and INformation Technology Research|volume=Vol. 2, Issue 2|pages=183-189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communications can also be delivered to recipients unbeknownst to the sender because of false assumptions made regarding the platform or medium which was used to send information. An example of this is failure to read a company's privacy policy regarding communications on their platform could lead one to assume their communication is protected when it is in fact not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theconversation.com/94-of-australians-do-not-read-all-privacy-policies-that-apply-to-them-and-thats-rational-behaviour-96353|title=94% of Australians do not read all privacy policies that apply to them – and that’s rational behaviour|last=Kemp|first=Katharine|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, companies frequently have been known to lack transparency in how they use information, this can be both intentional and unintentional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meijer|first=Ronald|last2=Conradie|first2=Peter|last3=Choenni|first3=Sunil|date=2014|title=Reconciling Contradictions of Open Data Regarding Transparency, Privacy, Security and Trust|url=https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0718-18762014000300004&amp;lng=es&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt|journal=Journal of theoretical and applied electronic commerce research|volume=9|issue=3|pages=32–44|doi=10.4067/S0718-18762014000300004|issn=0718-1876|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion of communication privacy necessarily requires consideration of technological methods of protecting information/communication in digital mediums, the effectiveness and ineffectiveness of such methods/systems, and the development/advancement of new and current technologies.

=== Individual Privacy ===
In the context of digital privacy, individual privacy is the notion that individuals have a right to exist freely on the internet, in that they can choose what types of information they are exposed to, and more importantly that unwanted information should not interrupt them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hung|first=Humphry|last2=Wong|first2=Y.H.|date=2009-05-22|title=Information transparency and digital privacy protection: are they mutually exclusive in the provision of e‐services?|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/08876040910955161|journal=Journal of Services Marketing|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=154–164|doi=10.1108/08876040910955161|issn=0887-6045}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a digital breach of individual privacy would be an internet user receiving unwanted ads and emails/spam, or a computer virus that forces the user to take actions they otherwise wouldn't. In such cases the individual, during that moment, doesn't exist digitally without interruption from unwanted information; thus their individual privacy has been infringed upon.  

== Anonymity  ==

=== Information Anonymity ===
The following examples are systems that allow a user to remain anonymous when accessing the web, and by extension the use of which better ensures the protection of their [[personally identifiable information]].  

[[Onion routing|Onion Routing]] was originally developed by the U.S. Naval Research Lab and was intended to anonymize web traffic. The system created a path to any TCP/IP server by creating a pathway of onion routers. Once a pathway has been established, all information that is sent through it is anonymously delivered. When the user has finished utilizing the pathway it was essentially deleted which freed the resources to be used for a new pathway within Onion Routing. The [[The Onion Routing Project|Onion Routing project]] developed into what is today known as [[Tor (anonymity network)|TOR]], a completely open-sourced and free software. Unlike its predecessor, Onion Routing, Tor is able to protect both the anonymity of individuals as well as web providers.This allows people to set up anonymous web servers which in effect provides a censorship-resistant publishing service.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Ye11dQQ5CbcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=digital+privacy+study&amp;ots=CXxNO9M5Ke&amp;sig=hxB3kxTMyiCjs_F8dPQeNYlIMiw#v=onepage&amp;q=communication%20privacy&amp;f=false|title=Digital Privacy: Theory, Technologies, and Practices|last=Acquisti|first=Alessandro|last2=Gritzalis|first2=Stefanos|last3=Lambrinoudakis|first3=Costos|last4=Vimercati|first4=Sabrina di|date=2007-12-22|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420052183|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Communication Anonymity ===
The previously mentioned information anonymity systems can also potentially protect the contents of communications between two people, but there are other systems that directly function to guarantee a communication remains between only two people; they function to accomplish that only the intended recipient of a communication will receive it.&lt;ref&gt;Edman, M. and Yener, B. 2009. On anonymity in an electronic society: A survey of anonymous communication systems. ACM Comput. Surv. 42, 1, Article 5 (December 2009), 35 pages. DOI = 10.1145/1592451.1592456,  &lt;nowiki&gt;http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1592451.1592456&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these systems, [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] (which is an acronym for ''Pretty Good Privacy''), has existed in various forms for many years. It functions to protect email messages by encrypting and decrypting them. It originally existed as a command-line-only program, but in recent years it has evolved to have its own full interface and a multitude of email providers offer built-in PGP support. Users can also install PGP-compatible software and manually configure it to encrypt emails on nearly any platform.&lt;ref&gt;Zimmermann, Philip R. (1999). "Why I Wrote PGP". Essays on PGP. Philip Zimmermann.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] (acronym for Secure Sockets Layer) and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] (acronym for Transport Layer Security) are measures to secure payments online. While these systems are not immune from breaches or failure, many users benefit greatly from their use as every major browser program has support for it built in.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Hacking  ==

=== Phishing ===
''Main article: [[Phishing]]''

[[Phishing]] is a common method of obtaining someone's private information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-09-15|title=A survey of phishing attacks: Their types, vectors and technical approaches|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417418302070|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|language=en|volume=106|pages=1–20|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2018.03.050|issn=0957-4174}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generally consists of an individual (often referred in this context as a [[hacker]]), developing a website that looks similar to other major websites that a target person commonly uses. The target person can be directed to the site through a link in a 'fake' email that is designed to look like it came from the website he/she commonly uses. The user then clicks on the URL, proceeds to sign in, or provide other personal information, and as opposed to the information being submitted to the website that the user thought they were on, it is actually sent directly to the hacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-01-01|title=Taking the Bait: A Systems Analysis of Phishing Attacks|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978915001869|journal=Procedia Manufacturing|language=en|volume=3|pages=1109–1116|doi=10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.185|issn=2351-9789}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Societal Implications  ==
Digital privacy is a trending social concern. For example, the [[TED (conference)|TED talk]] by [[Eric Berlow]] and Sean Gourley subsequent to the [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures]] cast a shadow over the privacy of [[cloud storage]] and [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gourley|first=Eric Berlow and Sean|title=Mapping ideas worth spreading|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/eric_berlow_and_sean_gourley_mapping_ideas_worth_spreading|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While digital privacy is concerned with the [[privacy]] of digital information in general, in many contexts it specifically refers to information concerning [[personal identity]] shared over public networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eff.org/es/issues/privacy|title=Privacy|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2018-11-27|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before the [[Edward Snowden]] disclosures concerning the extent of the [[NSA]] [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] program were revealed in 2013, the public debate on digital privacy mainly centered on [[privacy concerns with social networking services]], as viewed from within these services.

As the secrecy of the American [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] becomes widely disclosed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2013/08/22/google-and-microsofts-plea-on-nsa-requests-moves-slowly-in-secret-court/|title=Google and Microsoft’s plea on NSA requests moves slowly in secret court|last=Roberts|first=Jeff|date=2013-08-22|website=gigaom.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, digital privacy is increasingly recognized as an issue in the context of [[mass surveillance]].

The use of [[cryptographic software]] to evade [[prosecution]] and [[harassment]] while sending and receiving information over computer networks is associated with [[crypto-anarchism]], a movement intending to protect individuals from mass surveillance by the government.

The depiction of '''disability in the media''' plays a major role in molding the public perception of [[disability]]. Perceptions portrayed in the [[journalism|media]] directly influence the way people with disabilities are treated in current society. "[Media platforms] have been cited as a key site for the reinforcement of negative images and ideas in regard to people with disabilities."&lt;ref name="Supercrip"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://physed.otago.ac.nz/sosol/v7i1/v7i1_1.html |title=sosol:Sociology of Sport Online - Volume 7 Issue 1 |publisher=Physed.otago.ac.nz |date=May 2001 |accessdate=18 June 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121220075938/http://physed.otago.ac.nz/sosol/v7i1/v7i1_1.html |archivedate=20 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a direct response, there have been increasing examples worldwide of people with disabilities pursuing their own media projects, such as creating [[film series]] centered on disability issues, [[radio program]]s and [[podcast]]s designed around and marketed towards those with disabilities, and so on.

==Common depictions==
The media generally depicts people with disabilities according to common stereotypes such as [[pity]] and [[heroism]].
Disability advocates often call this type of societal situation the "pity/heroism trap" or "pity/heroism dichotomy" and call instead for its supporters to "[[Piss On Pity]]" and push forward with [[inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ralston|first1=D. Christopher|last2=Ho|first2=Justin|title=Philosophical Reflections on Disability|date=19 September 2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j104ZMs0_-MC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=%22piss+on+pity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A4C-ulDwWz&amp;sig=MBPI3xU2aM4kkvl53TVvGplss40&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHo5-N2ITSAhWl2YMKHUMlAGU4KBDoAQgrMAU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When reports are about the "plight of the disabled" they rely on the pity or [[medical model of disability]]. [[Telethon]]s are an example of this, such as the [[Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon]] which has been heavily criticised and sometimes even [[street protest|physically protested]] by [[disability rights]] advocates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rabble.ca/news/nutty-profess-ion "The Nutty Profess-ion" article] from ''Rabble News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Longmore|first1=Paul K.|title=Telethons: Spectacle, Disability, and the Business of Charity|date=26 January 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190262075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative day-to-day reporting may occur chiefly by depicting a given person or people with a disability as a burden or drain on society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barnes|first1=Colin|title=Disabling Imagery and the Media|url=http://disability-studies.leeds.ac.uk/files/library/Barnes-disabling-imagery.pdf|website=Disability Studies|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "super-crip" model, in which subjects are portrayed as heroically overcoming their afflictions, is also often used when reporting on people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Supercrip1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Mary|title=Press victimization of disabled people|url=http://mediaschool.indiana.edu/research-2/ethics-case-studies/the-super-crip-stereotype/|website=Indiana University Bloomington|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social model of disability|social model]] tends to be used for reporting on the activities of disability rights activists if the report is positive.&lt;ref name="Supercrip2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Indiana University School of Journalism |url=http://journalism.indiana.edu/resources/ethics/sensitive-news-topics/the-super-crip-stereotype/ |title=Archive " The "super-crip" stereotype " Ethics cases online |publisher=Journalism.indiana.edu |date=1988-02-08 |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[inspiration porn]]" was coined in 2012 by disability rights activist [[Stella Young]] in an editorial in [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s webzine ''Ramp Up''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Young |first=Stella |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-03/young-inspiration-porn/4107006 |title=We're not here for your inspiration - The Drum (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2012-07-03 |accessdate=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term describes when people with disabilities are called ''inspirational'' solely or in part on the basis of their disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stella |last=Young |authorlink=Stella Young |url=http://www.ted.com/talks/stella_young_i_m_not_your_inspiration_thank_you_very_much?language=en |title=Stella Young: I’m not your inspiration, thank you very much &amp;#124; TED Talk |publisher=TED.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/2015/02/02/inspiration_porn_is_not_okay_disability_activists_are_not_impressed_with_feel_good_super_bowl_ads/ | title="Inspiration porn is not okay": Disability activists are not impressed with feel-good Super Bowl ads | website=Salon.com | date=2 February 2015 | accessdate=19 August 2015 | author=Heideman, Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stereotypes and Tropes===
Stereotypical depictions of disability that originate in the arts, film, literature, television, and other mass media fiction works, are frequently normalized through repetition to the general audience. Once such a stereotype is absorbed and accepted by the mainstream public, it continues to be repeated in the media, in many slightly varied forms, but staying close to the stereotype. Many media stereotypes about disability have been identified. They are sometimes referred to as "[[trope (literature)|tropes]]", meaning a recurring image or representation in the mainstream culture that is widely recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fahnestock|first=Jeanne|title=Rhetorical Style: The Uses of Language in Persuasion|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780199764129|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropes repeated in works of fiction have an influence on how society at large perceives people with disabilities. Other forms of media, in turn, then portray people with disabilities in ways that conform with tropes and repeat them. 

Some of these disability tropes (which may or may not be harmful) that have been identified in popular culture include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disability Tropes: Television Tropes &amp; Idioms|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilityTropes|publisher=[[tvtropes.org]]|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Little People are Surreal"
::Examples of this include the character Tattoo on the television series ''[[Fantasy Island]]''; a recurring use of a dwarf as a motif in American film director [[David Lynch]]'s works, such as ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''; and a dwarf actor who appears as a prominent cast extra in the film ''[[The Eyes of Laura Mars]]''.
* "Single Episode Disability"
::This is where a regular character on a television series obtains a temporary disability, learns a moral lesson, and makes a rapid, full recovery. Examples include an episode of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' where [[Hawkeye Pierce#Hawkeye Pierce|Hawkeye]] is temporarily blinded, and an episode of ''[[Law and Order: SVU]]'' where Detective Stabler is temporarily blind.
* "Disability Superpower"
::This is where fate removes one ability, it enhances another, so that a disabled character has one superpower. This has resulted in the creation of several subtypes of this disability trope, such as Blind Seer, Blind Weapon Master, Genius Cripple and Super Wheel Chair.

Other disability stereotypes that have been identified in popular culture include:&lt;ref name="BaglieriSusan"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Baglieri, Susan  |author2=Arthur Shapiro|title=Disability Studies and the Inclusive Classroom: Critical Practices for Creating Least Restrictive Attitudes|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9781136870248|page=No page}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The object of pity
::With this, disability is commonly associated with an illness or disease.
::See [[inspiration porn]]
* Sinister or evil
::Characters who are portrayed as having physical disabilities are cast as the anti-hero.
* Eternal innocence
::Paired with people with intellectual disabilities, such as in the films ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', ''[[I Am Sam]]'' and ''[[Rainman]]''.
* The victim of violence 
* Asexual, undesirable, or incapable of sexual or romantic interactions:
::Examples include adolescent coming-of-age storylines such as [[Artie Abrams]] on ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and “teen sick-lit” such as ''[[The Fault in Our Stars|The Fault in our Stars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chronic youth disability, sexuality, and U.S. media cultures of rehabilitation|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09687599.2015.1062226|journal = Disability &amp; Society|date = 2015-07-14|issn = 0968-7599|pages = 1–3|volume = 0|issue = 0|doi = 10.1080/09687599.2015.1062226|first = Jenny|last = Slater}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of disability tropes in mass media is related to other stereotypes, or tropes, that have developed when other marginalized groups in society are depicted, such as the [[Magical Negro]] trope identified, and criticized, by film director [[Spike Lee]]. The mocking names often given to these tropes when they are identified indicates a rejection of the harmful stereotypes that they propagate.

Stereotypes may endure in a culture for several reasons: they are constantly reinforced in the culture, which mass media does easily and effectively; they reflect a common human need to organize people and categorize them; they reinforce discrimination that allows one group of society to exploit and marginalize another group.&lt;ref name="BaglieriSusan" /&gt; Several studies of mass media in Britain and the United States have identified common stereotypes, such as "noble warrior", "charity cripple", "curio", "freak", and "Pollyanna", where the researchers identified a position of "disapproval", on the part of the media, of some aspect of the disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shakespeare|first=Tom|title=The Disability Reader: Social Science Perspectives|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1998|isbn=9780826453600|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that media portrayals of disability became more normalizing and accepting in the years immediately after [[World War II]], when returning veterans with war-related disabilities were being reintegrated into society. A backlash of intolerance towards disability followed during the mid-20th century, with some researchers speculating that this may have been related to society's reaction against any identifiable "difference" as a result of Cold War tensions. Depictions of disability in media soon reverted to emphasizing the "freakish" nature of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shakespeare|first=Tom|title=The Disability Reader: Social Science Perspectives|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1998|isbn=9780826453600|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast media programming for disabled audiences==
Broadcast media has in recent years begun to recognize the large audience of people with disabilities that it reaches. Programming dedicated to disability issues is increasing.

In 1990, the signing of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA) became the first news story on disability issues to become a lead story on cable news broadcaster [[CNN]]. News Director [[Ed Turner (television executive)|Ed Turner]] contacted the Washington bureau of CNN to have the signing of the ADA by President Bush broadcast live. The next day, the signing of the ADA was covered as the top headline in the ''[[New York Times]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'', and every other major U.S. newspaper. Disability rights activist [[Lex Frieden]] has stated, "That was the first time that millions of people were exposed to disability rights as the number one story".&lt;ref name="DorisZames"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Doris Zames Fleischer |author2=Frieda Zames |title=The Disability Rights Movement: From Charity to Confrontation|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2001|isbn=9781566398121|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; These milestones were a major change in reducing exclusion and invisibility for people with disabilities.

[[Radio reading service]]s are radio stations that broadcast readings from newspapers, magazines and books to mainly blind or partially sighted audiences.

In recent years, some mainstream publications and broadcasters have added writing and programming about disability-related topics. The Creative Diversity Network in the United Kingdom is an organization that advocates increased cultural and disability-related programming. Clare Morrow, the organization's Network Manager, states that "Disability is now at the heart of the diversity agenda for all of the UK's main television companies, thanks to their collective work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News and events|url=http://www.creativediversitynetwork.org/news.php|publisher=Creative Diversity Network|accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BBC Website includes ''Ouch!'', a disability news and discussion blog and internet talk show program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ouch! Blog|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ouch/|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)|accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications and broadcasts by disability related organisations==
Many activist and charitable organisations have websites and publish their own magazines or newsletters.

==Disability in documentary film==
Disability has been shown to audiences since the early days of documentary film. Educational silent films showing hospital patients with various disabling conditions were shown to medical and nursing students. Films of [[schizophrenia]] patients with symptoms of [[catatonia]], [[World War I]] veterans with extreme [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]] (PTSD) ([[shell-shock]]) symptoms, and many other such films survive today. [[Michael J. Dowling]] (1866-1921) was a prominent [[Minnesota]] politician and newspaper publisher, who was also a quadruple amputee. World War I inspired him to further the cause of veterans with disabilities. Dowling had himself filmed performing routine tasks on his own, and had the films screened for groups such as the [[American Medical Association]] in 1918. His efforts promoted the rehabilitation of the physically disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael J. Dowling Silent Film, Museum Collections Up Close: MNHS.ORG|url=http://discussions.mnhs.org/collections/2011/06/michael-j-dowling-silent-film/|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentary films sometimes had a tone that was a reflection of the public's morbid curiosity about visible disabilities that were considered shameful and ordinarily were hidden from public view. Nazi propagandists exploited this fear and prejudice to push the public to accept their [[euthanasia]] policies, including forcible sterilization, by screening films showing people with mental retardation and physical disabilities living in squalid conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marini, Irmo |author2=Noreen M. Glover-Graf |author3=Michael Jay Millington |title=Psychosocial Aspects of Disability: Insider Perspectives and Counseling Strategies|year=2011|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=9780826106025|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, American President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his White House staff made a great effort to disguise his handicap (Roosevelt became [[paraplegic]] after contracting [[polio]] as an adult). Roosevelt was photographed and filmed only from positions that would hide his disability from the public, for fear that he would be perceived as weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marini, Irmo |author2=Noreen M. Glover-Graf |author3=Michael Jay Millington |title=Psychosocial Aspects of Disability: Insider Perspectives and Counseling Strategies|year=2011|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=9780826106025|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, documentary films about disability have been widely viewed on both public and cable television programming. The [[Channel 5 (UK)]] program ''Extraordinary Lives'', and [[Channel 4]] program ''Body Shock'' in the United Kingdom, broadcast much documentary material about disability. Titles of some documentary programming includes: "''The Boy Who Sees Without Eyes'' — the 14-year-old American boy who navigates by sound; ''The Twin Within the Twin'' — the 34-year-old Bengali who carries his foetal twin within his abdomen; and ''The Twins Who Share a Body'' — Abby and Brittany Hensel, the world's only known dicephalus twins, ie. two heads with one body".&lt;ref name="LeeWrightPeter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee-Wright|first=Peter|title=The Documentary Handbook|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415434010|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the documentaries, perceived to be in the "shock doc" (shock documentary) genre, have been denounced by critics with disabilities. Although the documentary programming contains educational and scientific information, the sensationalized, overt emotional appeal of the "tabloid tone" of the programming has raised objections. Laurence Clark has written in the BBC Website's disability blog ''Ouch!'': {{blockquote|During these programs I often find myself screaming at the TV: 'Where the hell do they find these people?!' I suspect that someone somewhere has set up an agency called Rent-a-Freak, specifically to supply the most bizarre, eccentric disabled people they can find to budding documentary makers. But unlike today's documentary subjects, the freaks of old were at least paid to take part — and had some say over their performances.&lt;ref name="LeeWrightPeter" /&gt; }}

==Documentary photography==
[[File:Blind man carrying a paralysed man.jpg|thumb|A blind man carrying a paralyzed man on his back in the Levant, photo by [[Tancrède Dumas]], circa 1889.]]
The first photographer to become widely known for depicting the visibly disabled was [[Diane Arbus]], active in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.biography.com/people/diane-arbus-9187461|title = Diane Arbus Biography|date = |access-date = 2016-02-16|website = Biography.com|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her photographs, which are in fact art photographs, have been, and remain, highly controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = A Fresh Look at Diane Arbus|url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/a-fresh-look-at-diane-arbus-99861134/?all|website = Smithsonian|access-date = 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American documentary photographers Tom Olin and Harvey Finkle, known for documenting the [[disability rights movement]] since the 1980s, have exhibited at many venues including the National Constitution Center Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCC Marks Americans with Disabilities Act anniversary|url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2012/07/ncc-marks-americans-with-disabilities-act-anniversary/|publisher=Annenberg Center for Education and Outreach at the National Constitution Center|accessdate=July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==
Members of the public with disabilities have criticized media depictions of disability on the grounds that stereotypes are commonly repeated. Media coverage that is "negative", "unrealistic", or displays a preference for the "pitiful" and "sensationalistic" over the "everyday and human side of disability"&lt;ref name="Catherine"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Catherine A. Luther |author2=Carolyn Ringer Lepre |author3=Naeemah Clark |title=Diversity in U.S. Mass Media|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=9781444344516|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; are identified at the root of the dissatisfaction. Journalist Leye Jeannette Chrzanowski, who uses a wheelchair, has written:{{blockquote|Many people with disabilities believe mainstream journalists are incapable of accurately covering stories about them. Generally, journalists either portray us as pitiful cripples, super achievers, or insane mental patients. These erroneous media stereotypes of people with disabilities are perpetuated because journalists consistently fail to understand or learn about people with disabilities and the issues that are important to us.&lt;ref name="Catherine" /&gt;}}

Various organisations and programmes have been established to try to positively influence the frequency and quality of reporting on disability issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaanddisability.org/ |title=Media &amp; Disability. home |publisher=Mediaanddisability.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-disability.net/ |title=Media &amp; Disability Resources |publisher=media-disability.net |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-disability.org/ |title=European Congress on Media and Disability - Homepage |publisher=Media-disability.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, it was estimated that in the United States, there were between 3000 and 3500 newsletters, 200 magazines, and 50 to 60 newspapers regularly published that focussed on disability issues.&lt;ref name="DorisZames" /&gt;

Disability lobbyists for the American Disability Association (ADA), are unable to rely on the media as a source to support and spread their ideas on disability because they believe that the media will continue to misrepresent the disabled community since they are more interested in the stereotypes of disabled people than in the facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=edo&amp;AN=95095924&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|title=EBSCOhost Login|author=|date=|website=search.ebscohost.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7598">In [[Freudian psychology]], '''displacement''' ({{lang-de|Verschiebung}}, "shift, move") is an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] [[Defence mechanism|defence mechanism]] whereby the mind substitutes either a new aim or a new [[Object relations theory|object]] for goals felt in their original form to be dangerous or unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

A term originating with [[Sigmund Freud]],&lt;ref&gt;Salman Akhtar, ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (2009) p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; displacement operates in the mind unconsciously, its [[transference]] of emotions, ideas, or wishes being most often used to allay anxiety in the face of aggressive or sexual impulses.

==Freud==

Freud initially saw displacement as a means of dream-distortion, involving a shift of emphasis from important to unimportant elements,&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 2) p. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; or the replacement of something by a mere illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Freud called this “displacement of accent.” 

'''Displacement of object:''' Feelings that are connected with one person are displaced onto another person. A man who has had a bad day at the office, comes home and yells at his wife and children, is displacing his anger from workplace onto his family. Freud&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1913). Totem and taboo: Some points of agreement between the mental lives of savages and neurotics. Complete Works, 13: 1–162, London: Hogarth.&lt;/ref&gt; thought that when children have animal phobias, they may be displacing fears of their parents onto an animal. 

'''Displacement of attribution:''' A characteristic that one perceives in oneself but seems unacceptable is instead attributed to another person. This is essentially the mechanism of [[psychological projection]]; an aspect of the self is projected (displaced) onto someone else. Freud&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1927). The future of an illusion. ''Complete Works'', 21: 1–56. London: Hogarth.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that people commonly displace their own desires onto God’s will. 

'''Bodily displacements:''' A genital sensation may be experienced in the mouth (displacement upward) or an oral sensation may be experienced in the genitals (displacement downward). Novelist [[John Cleland]] in ‘’Fanny Hill’’&lt;ref&gt;Cleland, J. ''Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure''. Critical ed. by Peter Sabor, Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to the vagina as “the nethermouth.” Sexual attraction toward a human body can be displaced in [[sexual fetishism]], sometimes onto a particular body part like the foot or at other times onto an inanimate fetish object. 

Freud also saw displacement as occurring in jokes,&lt;ref&gt;''New Introductory Lectures'' p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in neuroses – the obsessional neurotic being especially prone to the technique of displacement onto the minute.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 120-1&lt;/ref&gt; When two or more displacements occurs towards the same idea, the phenomenon is called [[Condensation (psychology)|condensation]] (from the German ''Verdichtung'').

==The psychoanalytic mainstream==

Among Freud's mainstream followers, [[Otto Fenichel]] highlighted the displacement of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], either through [[Postponement of affect|postponement]] or by redirection, or both.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, he considered that "in part the paths of displacement depend on the nature of the drives that are warded off".&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Berne]] in his first, psychoanalytic work, maintained that "some of the most interesting and socially useful displacements of [[libido]] occur when both the aim and the object are partial substitutions for the biological aim and object...[[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]".&lt;ref&gt;Berne, ''A Layman's Guide'' p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacan==

In 1957, [[Jacques Lacan]], inspired by an article by linguist [[Roman Jakobson]] on [[metaphor and metonymy]], argued that the unconscious has the structure of a language, linking displacement to the [[poetic function]] of [[metonymy]],&lt;ref&gt;David Macey, Introduction, Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Funadamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. xxviii&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Condensation (psychology)|condensation]] to that of [[metaphor]].

As he himself put it, "in the case of ''Verschiebung'', 'displacement', the German term is closer to the idea of that veering off of signification that we see in metonymy, and which from its first appearance in Freud is represented as the most appropriate means used by the unconscious to foil censorship".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1997) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aggression==
{{expand section|date=October 2017}}
The aggressive drive – known as [[mortido]] – may be displaced quite as much as the [[libido|libidinal]] - the sex drive. Business or athletic competition, or hunting, for instance, offer plentiful opportunities for the expression of displaced mortido.&lt;ref&gt;Berne, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

In such [[scapegoating]] behavior, aggression may be displaced onto people with little or no connection with what is causing anger or frustration. Some people punch [[cushion]]s when they are angry at friends; a college student may snap at his or her roommate when upset about an exam grade ... etc.

Displacement can also act in a what looks like a 'chain-reaction', with people unwittingly becoming both victims and perpetrators of displacement. For example, a man is angry with his boss, but he cannot express this properly, so he hits his wife. The wife, in turn, hits one of the children, possibly disguising this as a "punishment" ([[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]]).

[[Ego psychology]] sought to use displacement in child rearing, a dummy being used as a displaced target for toddler sibling rivalry.&lt;ref&gt;Selma H. Fraiberg, ''The Magic Years'' (New York 1987) p. 151-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transferential displacement==
The displacement of feelings and attitudes from past significant others onto the present-day analyst constitutes a central aspect of the transference, particularly in the case of the neurotic.&lt;ref&gt;P. Schwmeister, ''Less Legible Meaning'' (1999) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsidiary form of displacement ''within'' the transference occurs when the patient disguises transference references by applying them to an apparent third party or to themself.&lt;ref&gt;P. Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Later writers have objected that whereas Freud only described the displacement of sex into culture, for example, the converse – social conflict being displaced into sexuality – is also true.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Dollimore, ''Sexual Dissidence'' &lt;1991) p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6004">'''Eco-investing''' or '''green investing''', is a form of [[socially responsible investing]] where investments are made in companies that support or provide [[environmentally friendly]] products and practices. These companies encourage (and often profit from) new technologies that support the transition from carbon dependence to more sustainable alternatives.&lt;ref name=chow&gt;{{Cite web|last=Henshaw |first=Mark |title=Eco Investor Guide |publisher=Eco Investor Guide, Inc. |year=2010 |url=http://www.ecoinvestorguide.com/wp-content/uploads/EcoInvestorGuide.pdf |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As industries' environmental impacts become more apparent, green topics have not only taken center stage in pop culture, but the financial world as well. In the 1990s many investors “began to look for those companies that were better than their competitors in terms of managing their environmental impact.” While some investors still focus their funds to avoid only “the most egregious polluters,” the emphasis for many investors has switched to changing “the way money is used,” and using “it in a positive, transformative way to get us from where we are now ultimately to a truly sustainable society.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Keane |first=Robert F. |title=The Green Advisor: SRI &amp; Green Investing Grow Up |publisher=Investment Advisor |date=1 November 2009 |url=http://www.advisorone.com/2009/11/01/the-green-advisor-sri-green-investing-grow-up |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Climate Prosperity Scoreboard – launched by Ethical Markets Media and The Climate Prosperity Alliance to monitor private investments in green companies – estimated that over $1.248 trillion has been invested in solar, wind, geothermal, ocean/hydro and other green sectors since 2007. This number represents investments from [[North America]], [[China]], [[India]], and [[Brazil]], as well at other developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=New Global Climate Prosperity Scoreboard Finds Over $1 Trillion Invested in Green Since 2007 |publisher=Green Money Journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.greenmoneyjournal.com/article.mpl?newsletterid=51&amp;articleid=749 |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eco/Green Investing versus Socially Responsible Investing==
While many eco-investments may be considered socially responsible investments, and vice versa, the two are not mutually inclusive. [[Socially responsible investing]] is the practice of investing only in those companies which satisfy certain moral or ethical criteria. This may include companies with an interest in the environment, but also supports various other social and religious issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Socially Responsible Investing |publisher=Investor Glossary |url=http://www.investorglossary.com/socially-responsible-investing.htm |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco-investing narrows in on the interests of sustainable environmental issues. Specifically, eco-investments focus on companies who work on renewable energy and clean technologies.

==Eco-investing sectors==
There are several sectors that fall under the eco-investing umbrella. [[Renewable energy]] refers to both solar, wind, tidal current,wave and conventional hydro technology. This includes companies that build [[solar panel]]s or [[wind turbine]]s, or the raw materials and services that contribute to these technologies&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt; It also refers to Energy Storage – companies that develop and use technologies to store large amounts of energy, particularly renewable energies. A good example of this is the fuel cells used in [[hybrid car]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Green Technology &amp; Alternative Fuels |publisher=Demand Media, Inc. |url=http://www.greencar.com/alternative-fuels-green-technology.php |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also under the renewable energy sector are Biofuels. This group includes companies that use or supply biological resources (like algae, corn or waster wood) to create energy or fuel. Other technologies that are included in the renewable energy group are: Geothermal (companies who use or convert heat to electric energy) and Hydroelectricity (companies who harness water energy to make electricity).&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

The Buildings and Efficiency sector refers to companies that manufacture green building materials or energy-efficient services in the world of engineering and architecture. Green building materials include energy-efficient glass, insulation, and lighting among others. Recycling companies and energy conservation companies also fall under this sector.&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

The Eco Living sector refers to companies that offer sustainable goods and services for healthy living. This includes organic farming, green pesticides, health care and pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

Green investment has significantly grown in the UK and there are now 136 funds listed on the [http://www.worldwiseinvestor.com/library Worldwise Investor fund library] under the themes: Agriculture, Carbon, Clean Energy, Forestry, Environmental, Multi-thematic and Water. All of these funds account for around [http://www.worldwiseinvestor.com/knowledge/reports?fd=%2527%2582%25F9%25B8%257F%25C5%2500%25BB%25E3%25B61sXm%25F1%259E%2584%252FK%2591%250E-%25F2%25B1x0L%25DFW%25B9%25C2Z%250Bf%2589%2501%25CCY%25C1%25D1%259A%2594%25E7%25C92s%25C5 £21.8bn] in the UK.

When trying to understand the self in terms of the brain, [[neuroscientist]]s have found contradictory results and [[paradox]]es. Nevertheless, Gonzalo Munevar has argued that neuroscience in an evolutionary context can give a proper explanation of the self. His Evolutionary Theory of the Self depends on, “the ability by the brain to coordinate new sensory information in light of the organism’s internal states and in the context of its personal history and genetic inheritance."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gonzalo Munevar, Mathew L. Cole, Yongquan Ye, JieYang, Yi Zheng, Uday Krishnamurthy, and Mark Haacke, “fMRI Study of Self vs. Others’ Attributions of Traits Consistent with Evolutionary Understanding of the Self,” Neuroscience Discovery, 2014, http://www.hoajonline.com/journals/pdf/2052-6946-2-3.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; His theory is an alternative conception for the explanation of the self, which takes into account the [[evolutionary biology]] of the brain.

[[Organism]]s that are highly complex execute the function of telling self from other with the brain and the [[immune system]]. To fulfill the function of recognizing self from other, the brain uses past experiences and [[genetic inheritance]] (e.g. survival, reproduction). The self is defined by these functions that distinguish an organisms from other organisms, which allow them to act as one whole entity in social and physical environments. Simply put, the theory revolves around the idea that the brain constitutes the self, which represents itself in a variety of internal states.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;A. Damasio: The Feeling of What Happens, Harcourt Brace &amp; Co, New York 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“A Darwinian Account of Self and Free Will,” in Evolution 2.0: implications of Darwinism in Philosophy and the Social and Natural Sciences, ed. by Weinert, F. and Brinkworth, M.H. (Springer, 2011), pp. 43-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The brain/self evolves for action to be able to interact with social and physical environments. It is suggested that the brain performs a complex list of tasks to complete these interactions to distinguish self from other. This defines the brain to be characteristically distributive to complete complex tasks, and thus suggests that the self is also distributive. Therefore, the Evolutionary Theory of the Self detours from the traditional conceptions that include the self being a centralized, unitary mechanism that is both conscious (sense of self) and compiled of a collection of episodic memories. Alternatively, it suggests that the conception of self is mostly [[Unconscious cognition|unconscious]], and the brain evolves from past experiences and [[genetic inheritance]] to create the evolutionary self.

In Munevar’s study, “fMRI Study of Self vs. Others’ Attributions of Traits Consistent with Evolutionary Understanding of the Self,” he aimed to demonstrate the experimental feasibility of this conception of the self as a distributive system, and discovered results complimenting the Evolutionary Theory of the Self while resolving the contradictions and paradoxes of traditional conceptions of self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==  Neuroscience problems and paradoxes of the self ==
One of the problems is that the results of brain-imaging studies of self-knowledge vary depending on the behavioral tasks chosen. Some studies use [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) to do self-attribution of personality traits, while others use [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI). Other studies prefer to do tasks involving self-recognition (recognizing a photograph or yourself and others). Studies that use self-attribution studies, “find neural activation of the [[medial prefrontal cortex]] (MPFC) as evidence for the self”, while studies consisting of self-recognition tasks find, “correlated activation of the right [[prefrontal lobe]] and regions of the [[Medial superior temporal area|medial]] and left hemisphere as evidence [[self-awareness]] and [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This variety of results of the studies have provided evidence for Gillihan and Farah to conclude that there is not a unitary and common [[neural system]] concerning the self, which leads into the next two problems of the traditional conception of self.&lt;ref name=gillihan&gt;Gillihan SJ and Farah MJ. ''Is self special? A critical review of evidence from experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience''. Psychol Bull. 2005; ''131'':76-97. | Article | PubMed&lt;/ref&gt; These problems are that the traditional conceptions of the self argue that the self is a unified mechanism that exists in a centralized area in the brain, and that the self is something we can consciously sense. The problems with these accounts are that there is scientific research contradicting the claims of traditional conceptions. Llinas suggests that the self is a form of perception and thus that the self is an invention of the brain just as secondary sensory qualities are.&lt;ref&gt;R. Llinas:  ''I of the Vortex'' (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that there is no one brain area that could account for the self, and he concludes that the self doesn’t exist. Although Llinas is confusing the conscious and unconscious self, because when he suggests the self as a form of perception he should be referring to the conscious self being a form of perception. Munevar suggests that Llinas is incorrect in assuming the self does not exist, because just as an elephant and the perception of an elephant are different things, so are the self and our perception of the self.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Traditional conceptions also assume that the self is a collection of [[episodic memories]], since they are memories of the actions that sculpt our [[Personality psychology|personalities]], and therefore closely link personality and the self. According to Klein, in a study of patients who had lost their [[Hippocampus|hippocampi]] (the part of the brain responsible for memories), patients were able to recollect their knowledge of personality even in the absence of [[episodic memories]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Klein: The cognitive neuroscience of knowing one’s self. In ''The Cognitive Neurosciences''&lt;/ref&gt; This points to show that the trait summaries of their personality must have come around subconsciously, inferring that the self can exist even in the absence of [[episodic memories]]. Thus, the self cannot be a collection of [[episodic memories]].

== Solutions to the problems ==
The Evolutionary Theory points out that distributive systems are characteristic of the brain. Organisms need to identify itself from others in many complex ways, thus many areas of the brain are used when distinguishes self from other. We need to understand that the brain is full of distributed mechanisms, thus creating an expectation that the self will be too. With this understanding, the Evolutionary Theory of the Self avoids all the difficulties about the unified and central mechanisms that traditional conceptions hold. In addition, the brain-based model of the evolutionary theory recognizes that the majority of the mental tasks highly complex organisms do are unconscious. Simply put, we may be aware of a decision we have made, but not the calculations that went into the decision as they are not capable to be understood by the conscious self.&lt;ref&gt;F. Crick: The Astonishing Hypothesis: The Scientific Search for the Soul (Scribner’s Sons, New York 1994, 265-268).&lt;/ref&gt; By attempting to take an evolutionary approach to understanding the self, the confrontation of self with the sense of self is avoided, in addition to, “all the problems that arise from an undue emphasis on consciousness.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As suggested by Munevar, research on the evolutionary theory of self needs to firstly examine the existence of distributed activation in the brain when doing a self-attribution task. Secondly, they need to examine distinctions in brain activity when identifying self and close others in a manner of objective vs subjective to see if there are activation variances between the two. Thirdly, research needs to use non-personality traits as well as personality traits to take into account the importance of non-personality traits to the evolutionary needs of an organism. Fourthly, the research should aim to prove that humans, “should identify with those close to us, although not as strongly as with ourselves."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These four aims were the four that structured the hypotheses in his study, and provide blueprint for further research to test.

== Evidence to support the theory ==
In Munevar’s study, they compared self vs other conditions in which personality trait adjectives were rated in terms of Self vs Best Friend, Self vs Bill Gates, and Best Friend vs Bill Gates. He used a blocked-design [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] [[paradigm]], where non-personality and personality trait adjectives were rated as to whether they applied to themselves or other. The four hypotheses were as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) Self conditions would show a different pattern of brain activation from those shown by Best Friend (i.e., close other) and Bill Gates (i.e., far other) conditions; (2) our data should exhibit a fair degree of distributive performance by the brain in responding to these attribution tasks; and (3) the resulting patterns of activation should show some overlap with structures normally involved in preparedness to action (motion). In addition, (4) the Best Friend condition would also differ from the Bill Gates condition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The study found that several areas of the brain were active when doing the tasks related to ‘Self’ and Best Friend. In support of the first hypothesis (1), there was very significant differential activation in [[Brodmann area 31|BA 31]] (covering part of [[Posterior cingulate|posterior cingulate gyrus]] and the medial parietal), and the [[substantia nigra]].&lt;ref name=gillihan/&gt; There was significant activity in the right and left portions of [[Brodmann area 23|BA 23]], and the [[Caudate nucleus|caudate]] tail. In a lesser degree, there was some activity in the [[Brodmann area 10|BA 10]] and the thalamus. There was also greater activation in [[Brodmann area 24|BA 24]], particularly the anterior cingulate cortex, in Self-Bill Gates condition compared to the Best Friend-Bill Gates condition. With these results, there is different brain patterns shown by Best Friend and Bill Gate conditions. The contrasting results found also support the second hypothesis (2), and indicate that a large number of distributive structures throughout the brain are used when doing a self-attribution task.

In support of the third hypothesis (3), he found a large amount of activation of the [[substantia nigra]] (key stricture of [[basal ganglia]] for action), in addition to the activation of the [[caudate nucleus]] of the [[basal ganglia]]. These areas in the brain are known to be crucial to the process of movement, and thus an overlap with these structures supports their hypothesis.

In support of the fourth hypothesis (4), the greater activation of [[Brodmann area 24|BA 24]] in comparison of Best Friend vs Bill Gates condition and the Self-Bill Gates condition points to show that humans strongly identify with those you are close to us, and less strongly with ourselves.

The results displayed that the brain areas that we use for thinking about ourselves may also be used for thinking about those who are important to us. The fact that there is this relationship with multiple parts of the brain being active during both goes to show that there is an association between the two, furthering to suggest that one area in the brain nor one unified mechanism is not responsible for the self. The results also support the evolutionary expectation of a connection between self and the preparedness for action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The activation of key areas in the [[basal ganglia]] and the differential activation of [[Brodmann area 31|BA 31]] by the self-conditions in contrast with the Best Friend conditions in this study, elude to further support the idea of personality being a product of the unconscious self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Future work ==
From the results seen in Munevar’s study, there are several implications for the future progress of this theory. Since the study had a limitation of gender impacting the results of the conditions of Self vs Best Friend and Best Friend vs Bill Gates, further research should be done that classify results of fMRI by each gender. Another positive direction this study points to is by studying brains with deficits in activation of the [[Anterior cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate]] that bring problems when identifying self from non-self. This problem is prevalent in mental disorders such as [[schizophrenia]], [[autism]], and late-stage [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]], where the ability to differentiate self vs other is compromised.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further research should use the results of Munevar's study and continue on to dissect the paradoxes and problems of traditional conceptions, while focusing on the evolutionary biology of the brain. Overall, the research done on the Evolutionary Theory of Self is promising and provides fruitful insight to the possibility of discovering new conclusions on what we know about the self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="66622">{{Continuum mechanics|cTopic=[[Solid mechanics]]}}
In [[continuum mechanics]], the '''finite strain theory'''—also called '''large strain theory''', or '''large deformation theory'''—deals with [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformations]] in which strains and/or rotations are large enough to invalidate assumptions inherent in [[infinitesimal strain theory]].  In this case, the undeformed and deformed configurations of the continuum are significantly different, requiring a clear distinction between them. This is commonly the case with [[elastomer]]s, [[Plasticity (physics)|plastically-deforming]] materials and other [[fluid]]s and [[Biology|biological]] [[soft tissue]].

==Displacement==

[[File:Displacement of a continuum.svg|400px|right|thumb|Figure 1. Motion of a continuum body.]]
The displacement of a body has two components: a [[rigid body|rigid-body]] displacement and a deformation.
* A rigid-body displacement consists of a simultaneous [[translation (physics)]] and rotation of the body without changing its shape or size.
* Deformation implies the change in shape and/or size of the body from an initial or undeformed configuration &lt;math&gt;\kappa_0(\mathcal B)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to a current or deformed configuration &lt;math&gt;\kappa_t(\mathcal B)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure 1).

A change in the configuration of a continuum body can be described by a [[displacement field (mechanics)|displacement field]]. A ''displacement field'' is a [[vector field]] of all displacement vectors for all particles in the body, which relates the deformed configuration with the undeformed configuration. The distance between any two particles changes if and only if deformation has occurred. If displacement occurs without deformation, then it is a rigid-body displacement.

===Material coordinates (Lagrangian description)===

The displacement of particles indexed by variable {{math|i}} may be expressed as follows. The vector joining the positions of a particle in the undeformed configuration &lt;math&gt;P_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and deformed configuration &lt;math&gt;p_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[displacement (vector)|displacement vector]]. Using &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;P_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in place of &lt;math&gt;p_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, both of which are vectors from the origin of the coordinate system to each respective point, we have the [[Continuum mechanics#Lagrangian description|Lagrangian description]] of the displacement vector:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u(\mathbf X,t)=u_i\mathbf e_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are the orthonormal [[unit vectors]] that define the [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the spatial (lab-frame) coordinate system.

Expressed in terms of the material coordinates, the displacement field is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u(\mathbf X,t) = \mathbf b(t)+\mathbf x(\mathbf X,t) - \mathbf X \qquad \text{or}\qquad u_i = \alpha_{iJ}b_J + x_i - \alpha_{iJ}X_J\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf b(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the displacement vector representing rigid-body translation.

The [[partial derivative]] of the displacement vector with respect to the material coordinates yields the ''material displacement gradient tensor'' &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u &amp;= \nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf x - \mathbf I = \mathbf F - \mathbf I \qquad &amp;\text{or}&amp; \qquad  \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X_K} =\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial X_K}-\delta_{iK} = F_{iK} - \delta_{iK}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Finite strain theory#Deformation gradient tensor|''deformation gradient tensor'']].

===Spatial coordinates (Eulerian description)===

In the [[Continuum mechanics#Eulerian description|Eulerian description]], the vector extending from a particle &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the undeformed configuration to its location in the deformed configuration is called the [[displacement (vector)|displacement vector]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf U(\mathbf x,t)=U_J\mathbf E_J\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are the unit vectors that define the basis of the material (body-frame) coordinate system.

Expressed in terms of spatial coordinates, the displacement field is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf U(\mathbf x,t) = \mathbf b(t)+\mathbf x - \mathbf X(\mathbf x,t) \qquad \text{or}\qquad U_J = b_J + \alpha_{Ji}x_i - X_J \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The partial derivative of the displacement vector with respect to the spatial coordinates yields the ''spatial displacement gradient tensor'' &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf U\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf U &amp;= \mathbf I - \nabla_{\mathbf x}\mathbf X = \mathbf I -\mathbf F^{-1} \qquad &amp;\text{or}&amp; \qquad  \frac{\partial U_J}{\partial x_k}  = \delta_{Jk}-\frac{\partial X_J}{\partial x_k} = \delta_{Jk} - F^{-1}_{Jk} \,.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Relationship between the material and spatial coordinate systems===

&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{Ji}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are the [[direction cosine]]s between the material and spatial coordinate systems with unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_J\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_J \cdot \mathbf e_i = \alpha_{Ji}=\alpha_{iJ}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship between &lt;math&gt;u_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;U_J\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;u_i=\alpha_{iJ}U_J \qquad \text{or} \qquad U_J=\alpha_{Ji}u_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_i = \alpha_{iJ}\mathbf E_J\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u(\mathbf X,t)=u_i\mathbf e_i=u_i(\alpha_{iJ}\mathbf E_J)=U_J\mathbf E_J=\mathbf U(\mathbf x,t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Combining the coordinate systems of deformed and undeformed configurations===

It is common to superimpose the coordinate systems for the deformed and undeformed configurations, which results in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf b=0\,\!&lt;/math&gt;,  and the direction cosines become [[Kronecker delta]]s, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_J \cdot \mathbf e_i = \delta_{Ji}=\delta_{iJ}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus in material (undeformed) coordinates, the displacement may be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u(\mathbf X,t) = \mathbf x(\mathbf X,t) - \mathbf X \qquad \text{or}\qquad u_i = x_i - \delta_{iJ}X_J\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

And in spatial (deformed) coordinates, the displacement may be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf U(\mathbf x,t) = \mathbf x - \mathbf X(\mathbf x,t) \qquad \text{or}\qquad U_J = \delta_{Ji}x_i - X_J \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Deformation gradient tensor==
[[File:Deformation.png|400px|right|thumb|Figure 2. Deformation of a continuum body.]]
The deformation gradient tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F(\mathbf X,t)=F_{jK}\mathbf e_j\otimes\mathbf I_K\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is related to both the reference and current configuration, as seen by the unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf e_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_K\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, therefore it is a ''[[two-point tensor]]''.

Due to the assumption of continuity of &lt;math&gt;\chi(\mathbf X,t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F\,\!&lt;/math&gt; has the inverse &lt;math&gt;\mathbf H= \mathbf F^{-1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf H\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the ''spatial deformation gradient tensor''. Then, by the [[implicit function theorem]],&lt;ref name=Lubliner2008&gt;{{cite book

The ''material deformation gradient tensor'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F(\mathbf X,t)=F_{jK}\mathbf e_j\otimes\mathbf I_K\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Tensor#Tensor rank|second-order tensor]] that represents the gradient of the mapping function or functional relation &lt;math&gt;\chi(\mathbf X,t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the [[Continuum mechanics|motion of a continuum]]. The material deformation gradient tensor characterizes the local deformation at a material point with position vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. deformation at neighbouring points, by transforming ([[linear transformation]]) a material line element emanating from that point from the reference configuration to the current or deformed configuration, assuming continuity in the mapping function &lt;math&gt;\chi(\mathbf X,t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. [[differentiable function]] of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf {X} \,\!&lt;/math&gt; and time &lt;math&gt;t\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that [[Fracture|crack]]s and voids do not open or close during the deformation. Thus we have,

:&lt;math&gt; 
  \begin{align}
    d\mathbf{x} &amp;=\frac {\partial \mathbf{x}} {\partial \mathbf {X}}\,d\mathbf{X} 
                  \qquad &amp;\text{or}&amp; \qquad 
    dx_j =\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_K}\,dX_K \\
                &amp;= \nabla \chi(\mathbf X,t) \,d\mathbf{X} = \mathbf F(\mathbf X,t) \,d\mathbf{X} 
                  \qquad &amp;\text{or}&amp; \qquad 
    dx_j =F_{jK}\,dX_K \,.
  \end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Relative displacement vector===

Consider a [[Continuum mechanics|particle or material point]] &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with position vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf X=X_I\mathbf I_I\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the undeformed configuration (Figure 2). After a displacement of the body, the new position of the particle indicated by &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the new configuration is given by the vector position &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=x_i\mathbf e_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The coordinate systems for the undeformed and deformed configuration can be superimposed for convenience.

Consider now a material point &lt;math&gt;Q \,\!&lt;/math&gt; neighboring &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, with position vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}+ \Delta \mathbf{X}=(X_I+\Delta X_I)\mathbf I_I\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. In the deformed configuration this particle has a new position &lt;math&gt;q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; given by the position vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}+ \Delta \mathbf{x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming that the line segments &lt;math&gt;\Delta X\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \mathbf x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; joining the particles &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in both the undeformed and deformed configuration, respectively, to be very small, then we can express them as &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Thus from Figure 2 we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf{x}+ d\mathbf{x}&amp;= \mathbf{X}+d\mathbf{X}+\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}+d\mathbf{X}) \\
d\mathbf{x} &amp;= \mathbf{X}-\mathbf{x}+d\mathbf{X}+\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}+d\mathbf{X}) \\
 &amp;= d\mathbf{X}+\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}+d\mathbf{X})-\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}) \\
 &amp;= d\mathbf{X}+d\mathbf{u} \\
\end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {du}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the '''relative displacement vector''', which represents the relative displacement of &lt;math&gt;Q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the deformed configuration.

====Taylor approximation====

For an infinitesimal element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and assuming continuity on the displacement field, it is possible to use a [[Taylor series expansion]] around point &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, neglecting higher-order terms, to approximate the components of the relative displacement vector for the neighboring particle &lt;math&gt;Q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}+d\mathbf{X})&amp;=\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X})+d\mathbf{u} \quad &amp; \text{or} &amp; \quad u_i^* = u_i+du_i \\
&amp;\approx \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X})+\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\cdot d\mathbf X \quad &amp; \text{or} &amp; \quad u_i^* \approx u_i+\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial X_J}dX_J \,.
\end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the previous equation &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x= d\mathbf{X}+d\mathbf{u}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\mathbf x&amp;=d\mathbf X+d\mathbf u \\
&amp;=d\mathbf X+\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\cdot d\mathbf X\\
&amp;=\left(\mathbf I + \nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\right)d\mathbf X\\
&amp;=\mathbf F d\mathbf X
\end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Time-derivative of the deformation gradient ===
Calculations that involve the time-dependent deformation of a body often require a time derivative of the deformation gradient to be calculated.  A geometrically consistent definition of such a derivative requires an excursion into [[differential geometry]]&lt;ref name=Yavari&gt;A. Yavari, J.E. Marsden, and M. Ortiz, On spatial and material covariant balance laws in elasticity, Journal of Mathematical Physics, 47, 2006, 042903; pp. 1–53.&lt;/ref&gt; but we avoid those issues in this article.

The time derivative of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \dot{\mathbf{F}} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{F}}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left[\frac{\partial \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X}, t)}{\partial \mathbf{X}}\right] = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{X}}\left[\frac{\partial \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X}, t)}{\partial t}\right] = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{X}}\left[\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{X}, t)\right]
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity.  The derivative on the right hand side represents a '''material velocity gradient'''. It is common to convert that into a spatial gradient, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \dot{\mathbf{F}} = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{X}}\left[\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{X}, t)\right] = \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{x}}\left[\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{X},t)\right]\cdot\frac{\partial \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X}, t)}{\partial \mathbf{X}}
   = \boldsymbol{l}\cdot\mathbf{F}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{l}&lt;/math&gt; is the '''spatial velocity gradient'''.  If the spatial velocity gradient is constant, the above equation can be solved exactly to give
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{F} = e^{\boldsymbol{l}\, t}
 &lt;/math&gt;
assuming &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{1}&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  There are several methods of computing the [[matrix exponential|exponential]] above.

Related quantities often used in continuum mechanics are the '''rate of deformation tensor''' and the '''spin tensor''' defined, respectively, as:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{d} = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(\boldsymbol{l} + \boldsymbol{l}^T\right) \,,~~
  \boldsymbol{w} = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(\boldsymbol{l} - \boldsymbol{l}^T\right) \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The rate of deformation tensor gives the rate of stretching of line elements while the spin tensor indicates the rate of rotation or [[vorticity]] of the motion.

==Transformation of a surface and volume element==

To transform quantities that are defined with respect to areas in a deformed configuration to those relative to areas in a reference configuration, and vice versa, we use Nanson's relation, expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
  da~\mathbf{n} = J~dA~\mathbf{F}^{-T}\cdot \mathbf{N}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;da\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is an area of a region in the deformed configuration, &lt;math&gt;dA\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the same area in the reference configuration, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the outward normal to the area element in the current configuration while &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the outward normal in the reference configuration, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the [[deformation gradient]], and &lt;math&gt;J = \det\mathbf{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The corresponding formula for the transformation of the volume element is 
:&lt;math&gt;
  dv = J~dV 
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Derivation of Nanson's relation (see also &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Owens|first1=Eduardo de Souza Neto, Djordje Peric, David|title=Computational methods for plasticity : theory and applications|date=2008|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|isbn=978-0-470-69452-7|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
|-
|To see how this formula is derived, we start with the oriented area elements
in the reference and current configurations:
:&lt;math&gt;
  d\mathbf{A} = dA~\mathbf{N} ~;~~ d\mathbf{a} = da~\mathbf{n}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The reference and current volumes of an element are
:&lt;math&gt;
  dV = d\mathbf{A}^{T}\cdot d\mathbf{L} ~;~~ dv = d\mathbf{a}^{T} \cdot d\mathbf{l}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{l} = \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{L}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
 d\mathbf{a}^{T} \cdot d\mathbf{l}= dv = J~dV = J~d\mathbf{A}^{T}\cdot d\mathbf{L}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or,
:&lt;math&gt;
    d\mathbf{a}^{T} \cdot \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{L} = dv = J~dV = J~d\mathbf{A}^{T}\cdot d\mathbf{L}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
so,
:&lt;math&gt;
   d\mathbf{a}^{T} \cdot \mathbf{F} = J~d\mathbf{A}^{T}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
So we get
:&lt;math&gt;
  d\mathbf{a} = J~\mathbf{F}^{-T} \cdot d\mathbf{A}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or,
:&lt;math&gt;
  da~\mathbf{n} = J~dA~\mathbf{F}^{-T}\cdot \mathbf{N}\qquad \qquad \square
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Polar decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor==
[[File:Polar decomposition of F.png|400px|right|thumb|Figure 3. Representation of the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient]]

The deformation gradient &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, like any invertible second-order tensor, can be decomposed, using the [[polar decomposition]] theorem, into a product of two second-order tensors (Truesdell and Noll, 1965): an orthogonal tensor and a positive definite symmetric tensor, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{R}\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{V} \mathbf{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where the tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a [[proper orthogonal tensor]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R^{-1}= \mathbf R^T\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\det \mathbf R=+1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, representing a rotation; the tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the ''right stretch tensor''; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; the ''left stretch tensor''. The terms ''right'' and ''left'' means that they are to the right and left of the rotation tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are both [[positive-definite matrix|positive definite]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x\cdot\mathbf U \cdot \mathbf x\ge 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x\cdot\mathbf V \cdot \mathbf x\ge 0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x \in \mathbb R^3&lt;/math&gt;, and [[symmetric tensor]]s, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathbf U=\mathbf U^T\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf V=\mathbf V^T\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, of second order.

This decomposition implies that the deformation of a line element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the undeformed configuration onto &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the deformed configuration, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x=\mathbf F \,d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, may be obtained either by first stretching the element by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf U\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x'=\mathbf U \,d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, followed by a rotation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x=\mathbf R \,d\mathbf x'\,\!&lt;/math&gt;; or equivalently, by applying a rigid rotation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R\,\!&lt;/math&gt; first, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x'=\mathbf R \,d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, followed later by a stretching &lt;math&gt;\mathbf V\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x=\mathbf V \,d\mathbf x'\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (See Figure 3).

Due to the orthogonality of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf V=\mathbf R\cdot\mathbf U \cdot \mathbf R^T\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

so that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf U\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf V\,\!&lt;/math&gt; have the same [[eigenvalues]] or ''principal stretches'', but different [[eigenvectors]] or ''principal directions'' &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The principal directions are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_i = \mathbf{R} \mathbf{N}_i. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This polar decomposition, which is unique as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is invertible with a positive determinant, is a corrolary of the [[singular-value decomposition]].

==Deformation tensors==
Several rotation-independent deformation tensors are used in mechanics.  In solid mechanics, the most popular of these are the right and left Cauchy–Green deformation tensors.

Since a pure rotation should not induce any strains in a deformable body, it is often convenient to use rotation-independent measures of deformation in [[continuum mechanics]]. As a rotation followed by its inverse rotation leads to no change (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}\mathbf{R}^T=\mathbf{R}^T\mathbf{R}=\mathbf{I}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) we can exclude the rotation by multiplying &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; by its [[transpose]].

===The right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor===
In 1839, [[George Green (mathematician)|George Green]] introduced a deformation tensor known as the ''right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor'' or ''Green's deformation tensor'',  defined as:&lt;ref name=note1&gt;The [[IUPAC]] recommends that this tensor be called the Cauchy strain tensor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IUPAC&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. Kaye, R. F. T. Stepto, W. J. Work, J. V. Aleman (Spain), A. Ya. Malkin|year=1998|title=Definition of terms relating to the non-ultimate mechanical properties of polymers|journal= Pure Appl. Chem.|volume= 70|issue=3|pages=701–754|url=http://old.iupac.org/reports/1998/7003kaye/index.html|doi=10.1351/pac199870030701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf C=\mathbf F^T\mathbf F=\mathbf U^2 \qquad \text{or} \qquad C_{IJ}=F_{kI}~F_{kJ} = \frac {\partial x_k} {\partial X_I} \frac {\partial x_k} {\partial X_J}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Physically, the Cauchy–Green tensor gives us the square of local change in distances due to deformation, i.e. &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x^2=d\mathbf X\cdot\mathbf C \cdot d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Invariants of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are often used in the expressions for [[strain energy density function]]s.  The most commonly used [[Invariants of tensors|invariants]] are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
     I_1^C &amp; := \text{tr}(\mathbf{C}) = C_{II} = \lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2 + \lambda_3^2 \\
     I_2^C &amp; := \tfrac{1}{2}\left[(\text{tr}~\mathbf{C})^2 - \text{tr}(\mathbf{C}^2) \right]
       = \tfrac{1}{2}\left[(C_{JJ})^2 - C_{IK}C_{KI}\right] = \lambda_1^2\lambda_2^2 + \lambda_2^2\lambda_3^2 + \lambda_3^2\lambda_1^2 \\
     I_3^C &amp; := \det(\mathbf{C}) = \lambda_1^2\lambda_2^2\lambda_3^2.
  \end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are stretch ratios for the unit fibers that are initially oriented along the eigenvector directions of the right (reference) stretch tensor (these are not generally aligned with the three axis of the coordinate systems).

===The Finger deformation tensor===
The [[IUPAC]] recommends&lt;ref name=IUPAC/&gt; that the inverse of the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor (called the Cauchy tensor in that document), i. e.,  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf C^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, be called the '''Finger tensor'''.  However, that nomenclature is not universally accepted in applied mechanics.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}=\mathbf C^{-1}=\mathbf F^{-1}\mathbf F^{-T} \qquad \text{or} \qquad f_{IJ}=\frac {\partial X_I} {\partial x_k} \frac {\partial X_J} {\partial x_k}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===The left Cauchy–Green or Finger deformation tensor===
Reversing the order of multiplication in the formula for the right Green–Cauchy deformation tensor leads to the ''left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor'' which is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf B=\mathbf F\mathbf F^T=\mathbf V^2 \qquad \text{or} \qquad B_{ij}=\frac {\partial x_i} {\partial X_K} \frac {\partial x_j} {\partial X_K}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor is often called the ''Finger deformation tensor'', named after [[Josef Finger]] (1894).&lt;ref name=IUPAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo N. Dvorkin, Marcela B. Goldschmit, 2006 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MVqa05_2QmAC&amp;pg=PA25 Nonlinear Continua], p. 25, Springer {{ISBN|3-540-24985-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=note2&gt;The [[IUPAC]] recommends that this tensor be called the Green strain tensor.&lt;/ref&gt;

Invariants of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are also used in the expressions for [[strain energy density function]]s.  The conventional invariants are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  I_1 &amp; := \text{tr}(\mathbf{B}) = B_{ii} = \lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2 + \lambda_3^2\\
  I_2 &amp; := \tfrac{1}{2}\left[(\text{tr}~\mathbf{B})^2 - \text{tr}(\mathbf{B}^2)\right]
        = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(B_{ii}^2 - B_{jk}B_{kj}\right) = \lambda_1^2\lambda_2^2 + \lambda_2^2\lambda_3^2 + \lambda_3^2\lambda_1^2 \\
  I_3 &amp; := \det\mathbf{B} = J^2 = \lambda_1^2\lambda_2^2\lambda_3^2
  \end{align}
 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;J:=\det\mathbf{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the determinant of the deformation gradient.

For incompressible materials, a slightly different set of invariants is used:
:&lt;math&gt;
    (\bar{I}_1 := J^{-2/3} I_1 ~;~~ \bar{I}_2 := J^{-4/3} I_2 ~;~~ J=1) ~.
 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===The Cauchy deformation tensor===
Earlier in 1828,&lt;ref&gt;Jirásek,Milan;  Bažant, Z. P. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=8mz-xPdvH00C&amp;pg=PA463 Inelastic analysis of structures], Wiley, p. 463 {{ISBN|0-471-98716-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] introduced a deformation tensor defined as  the inverse of the left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf B^{-1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  This tensor has also been called the '''Piola tensor'''&lt;ref name=IUPAC /&gt; and the '''Finger tensor'''&lt;ref&gt;J. N. Reddy, David K. Gartling (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=sv0VKLL5lWUC&amp;pg=PA317 The finite element method in heat transfer and fluid dynamics], p. 317, CRC Press {{ISBN|1-4200-8598-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the rheology and fluid dynamics literature.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}=\mathbf B^{-1}=\mathbf F^{-T}\mathbf F^{-1} \qquad \text{or} \qquad c_{ij}=\frac {\partial X_K} {\partial x_i} \frac {\partial X_K} {\partial x_j}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Spectral representation===
If there are three distinct principal stretches &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i \,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the [[spectral decomposition]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is given  by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i^2 \mathbf{N}_i \otimes \mathbf{N}_i \qquad \text{and} \qquad \mathbf{B} = \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i^2 \mathbf{n}_i \otimes \mathbf{n}_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf U = \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i \mathbf N_i \otimes \mathbf N_i ~;~~
        \mathbf V = \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i \mathbf n_i \otimes \mathbf n_i \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf R = \sum_{i=1}^3 \mathbf n_i \otimes \mathbf N_i ~;~~
        \mathbf F = \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i \mathbf n_i \otimes \mathbf N_i \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{R}~\mathbf{U}~\mathbf{R}^T =
   \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i~\mathbf{R}~(\mathbf{N}_i\otimes\mathbf{N}_i)~\mathbf{R}^T =
   \sum_{i=1}^3 \lambda_i~(\mathbf{R}~\mathbf{N}_i)\otimes(\mathbf{R}~\mathbf{N}_i)
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, the uniqueness of the spectral decomposition also implies that &lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{n}_i = \mathbf{R}~\mathbf{N}_i \,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  The left stretch (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{V}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) is also called the ''spatial stretch tensor'' while the right stretch (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;) is called the ''material stretch tensor''.

The effect of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; acting on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is to stretch the vector by &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and to rotate it to the new orientation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}_i\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{F}~\mathbf{N}_i = \lambda_i~(\mathbf{R}~\mathbf{N}_i) = \lambda_i~\mathbf{n}_i
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
In a similar vein, 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{F}^{-T}~\mathbf{N}_i = \cfrac{1}{\lambda_i}~\mathbf{n}_i ~;~~
  \mathbf{F}^T~\mathbf{n}_i = \lambda_i~\mathbf{N}_i ~;~~
  \mathbf{F}^{-1}~\mathbf{n}_i = \cfrac{1}{\lambda_i}~\mathbf{N}_i ~.
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivatives of stretch===
[[Tensor derivative (continuum mechanics)|Derivatives]] of the stretch with respect to the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor are used to  derive the stress-strain relations of many solids, particularly [[hyperelastic material]]s.  These derivatives are
:&lt;math&gt;
  \cfrac{\partial\lambda_i}{\partial\mathbf{C}} =
       \cfrac{1}{2\lambda_i}~\mathbf{N}_i\otimes\mathbf{N}_i =
       \cfrac{1}{2\lambda_i}~\mathbf{R}^T~(\mathbf{n}_i\otimes\mathbf{n}_i)~\mathbf{R} ~;~~ i=1,2,3
 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
and follow from the observations that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{C}:(\mathbf{N}_i\otimes\mathbf{N}_i) = \lambda_i^2 ~;~~~~\cfrac{\partial\mathbf{C}}{\partial\mathbf{C}} = \mathsf{I}^{(s)} ~;~~~~ \mathsf{I}^{(s)}:(\mathbf{N}_i\otimes\mathbf{N}_i)=\mathbf{N}_i\otimes\mathbf{N}_i.
 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

===Physical interpretation of deformation tensors===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = X^i~\boldsymbol{E}_i&lt;/math&gt; be a Cartesian coordinate system defined on the undeformed body and let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = x^i~\boldsymbol{E}_i&lt;/math&gt; be another system defined on the deformed body.  Let a curve &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}(s)&lt;/math&gt; in the undeformed body be parametrized using &lt;math&gt;s \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.  Its image in the deformed body is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X}(s))&lt;/math&gt;.

The undeformed length of the curve is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
l_X
= \int_0^1 \left| \cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s} \right|~ds
= \int_0^1 \sqrt{ \cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s}\cdot\cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s}}~ds
= \int_0^1 \sqrt{ \cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s}\cdot\boldsymbol{I} \cdot\cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s} }~ds
&lt;/math&gt;
After deformation, the length becomes
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
l_x &amp; = \int_0^1 \left| \cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d s} \right|~ds
      = \int_0^1 \sqrt{\cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d s}\cdot\cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d s}}~ds
      = \int_0^1 \sqrt{
        \left(\cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d \mathbf{X}}\cdot\cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s}\right)
        \cdot
        \left(\cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d \mathbf{X}}\cdot\cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s}\right)}~ds
\\
      &amp; = \int_0^1 \sqrt{\cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s}\cdot\left[
                        \left(\cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d \mathbf{X}}\right)^T\cdot \cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d \mathbf{X}}\right]
\cdot\cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s} }~ds
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Note that the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{C} := \boldsymbol{F}^T\cdot\boldsymbol{F} = \left(\cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d \mathbf{X}}\right)^T\cdot \cfrac{d \mathbf{x}}{d \mathbf{X}}
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence,
:&lt;math&gt;
   l_x = \int_0^1 \sqrt{ \cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s}\cdot\boldsymbol{C} \cdot\cfrac{d \mathbf{X}}{d s} }~ds
&lt;/math&gt;
which indicates that changes in length are characterized by &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Finite strain tensors==
The concept of ''strain'' is used to evaluate how much a given displacement differs locally from a rigid body displacement.&lt;ref name=Lubliner2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=BelytschkoLiuMoran2000&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf C - \mathbf I)\qquad \text{or} \qquad E_{KL}=\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_L}-\delta_{KL}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or as a function of the displacement gradient tensor
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E =\frac{1}{2}\left[ (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T + \nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u + (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T \cdot\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\right]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;E_{KL}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_K}{\partial X_L}+\frac{\partial u_L}{\partial X_K}+\frac{\partial u_M}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial u_M}{\partial X_L}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The Green-Lagrangian strain tensor is a measure of how much &lt;math&gt;\mathbf C\,\!&lt;/math&gt; differs from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''Eulerian-Almansi finite strain tensor'', referenced to the deformed configuration, i.e. Eulerian description, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf I - \mathbf c)=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf I - \mathbf B ^{-1})
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
e_{rs}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\delta_{rs} - \frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_r}\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_s} \right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or as a function of the displacement gradients we have
:&lt;math&gt;e_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} +\frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}-\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_j}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

!Derivation of the Lagrangian and Eulerian finite strain tensors

|A measure of deformation is the difference between the squares of the differential line element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, in the undeformed configuration, and &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, in the deformed configuration (Figure 2). Deformation has occurred if the difference is non zero, otherwise a rigid-body displacement has occurred. Thus we have,

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{x}^2 - d\mathbf{X}^2=d\mathbf x\cdot d\mathbf x-d\mathbf X\cdot d\mathbf X
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
(dx)^2 - (dX)^2=dx_jdx_j-dX_M\,dX_M\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In the Lagrangian description, using the material coordinates as the frame of reference, the linear transformation between the differential lines is

:&lt;math&gt; d\mathbf x = \frac {\partial \mathbf x} {\partial \mathbf X}\,d\mathbf X=\mathbf F \,d\mathbf{X} \qquad\text{or} \qquad dx_j=\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_M} \,dX_M\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Then we have,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\mathbf{x}^2&amp;=d\mathbf x \cdot d\mathbf x \\
&amp;= \mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X \cdot \mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X \\
&amp;= d\mathbf X \cdot \mathbf F^T\mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X \\
&amp;= d\mathbf X\cdot\mathbf C\cdot d\mathbf X
\end{align}
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\begin{align}
(dx)^2&amp;=dx_j\,dx_j \\
&amp;= \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_L}\,dX_K\,dX_L \\
&amp;= C_{KL}\,dX_K\,dX_L \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_{KL}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are the components of the ''right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor'', &lt;math&gt;\mathbf C=\mathbf F^T \mathbf F\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Then, replacing this equation into the first equation we have,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\mathbf{x}^2 - d\mathbf{X}^2 &amp;= d\mathbf X\cdot\mathbf C\cdot d\mathbf X-d\mathbf X\cdot d\mathbf X \\
&amp;=d\mathbf X\cdot (\mathbf C - \mathbf I)\cdot d\mathbf X \\
&amp;= d\mathbf X \cdot 2\mathbf E \cdot d\mathbf X \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(dx)^2 - (dX)^2 &amp;= \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_L}\,dX_K\,dX_L-dX_M\,dX_M \\
&amp;= \left( \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_L}-\delta_{KL}\right)\,dX_K\,dX_L \\
&amp;=2E_{KL}\,dX_K\,dX_L
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_{KL}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, are the  components of a second-order tensor called the ''Green – St-Venant strain tensor'' or the ''Lagrangian finite strain tensor'',
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf C - \mathbf I)\qquad \text{or} \qquad E_{KL}=\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_L}-\delta_{KL}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In the Eulerian description, using the spatial coordinates as the frame of reference, the linear transformation between the differential lines is
:&lt;math&gt; d\mathbf{X} = \frac {\partial \mathbf{X}} {\partial \mathbf {x}}d\mathbf{x}=\mathbf F^{-1} \, d\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{H}  \,d\mathbf{x} \qquad \text{or} \qquad dX_M=\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_n}\, dx_n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_n}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are the components of the ''spatial deformation gradient tensor'',  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\mathbf{X}^2&amp;=d\mathbf X \cdot d\mathbf X \\
&amp;= \mathbf F^{-1} \cdot d\mathbf x \cdot \mathbf F^{-1} \cdot d\mathbf x \\
&amp;= d\mathbf x \cdot \mathbf F^{-T}\mathbf F^{-1} \cdot d\mathbf x \\
&amp;= d\mathbf x\cdot\mathbf c\cdot d\mathbf x
\end{align}
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\begin{align}
(dX)^2&amp;=dX_M\,dX_M \\
&amp;= \frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_r}\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_s}\,dx_r\,dx_s \\
&amp;= c_{rs}\,dx_r\,dx_s  \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where the second order tensor &lt;math&gt;c_{rs}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is called ''Cauchy's deformation tensor'', &lt;math&gt;\mathbf c=\mathbf F^{-T}\mathbf F^{-1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\mathbf{x}^2 - d\mathbf{X}^2 &amp;= d\mathbf x\cdot d\mathbf x-d\mathbf x\cdot\mathbf c\cdot d\mathbf x \\
&amp;=d\mathbf x\cdot (\mathbf I - \mathbf c)\cdot d\mathbf x \\
&amp;= d\mathbf x \cdot 2\mathbf e \cdot d\mathbf x \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(dx)^2 - (dX)^2 &amp;= dx_j\,dx_j-\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_r}\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_s}\,dx_r\,dx_s \\
&amp;= \left(\delta_{rs} - \frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_r}\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_s} \right)\,dx_r\,dx_s \\
&amp;=2e_{rs}\,dx_r\,dx_s
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e_{rs}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, are the  components of a second-order tensor called the ''Eulerian-Almansi finite strain tensor'',
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf e=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf I - \mathbf c)
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
e_{rs}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\delta_{rs} - \frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_r}\frac{\partial X_M}{\partial x_s} \right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Both the Lagrangian and Eulerian finite strain tensors can be conveniently expressed in terms of the ''displacement gradient tensor''. For the Lagrangian strain tensor, first we differentiate the displacement vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u(\mathbf X, t)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the material coordinates &lt;math&gt;X_M\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to obtain the ''material displacement gradient tensor'',  &lt;math&gt;\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf u(\mathbf X,t) &amp;= \mathbf x(\mathbf X,t) - \mathbf X \\
\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u &amp;= \mathbf F - \mathbf I \\
\mathbf F &amp;= \nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u + \mathbf I \\
\end{align}
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\begin{align}
u_i&amp; = x_i-\delta_{iJ}X_J \\
\delta_{iJ}U_J &amp;= x_i-\delta_{iJ}X_J \\
x_i&amp;=\delta_{iJ}\left(U_J+X_J\right) \\
\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial X_K}&amp;=\delta_{iJ}\left(\frac{\partial U_J}{\partial X_K}+\delta_{JK}\right) \\
\end{align}
\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing this equation into the expression for the Lagrangian finite strain tensor we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf E &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf F^T\mathbf F-\mathbf I\right) \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left[ \left\{ (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T+\mathbf I\right\}\left( \nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u+\mathbf I\right)-\mathbf I\right] \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left[  (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T + \nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u + (\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u)^T \cdot\nabla_{\mathbf X}\mathbf u\right] \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
E_{KL}&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial x_j}{\partial X_L}-\delta_{KL}\right) \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left[\delta_{jM}\left(\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_K}+\delta_{MK}\right)\delta_{jN}\left(\frac{\partial U_N}{\partial X_L}+\delta_{NL}\right)-\delta_{KL}\right] \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left[\delta_{MN}\left(\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_K}+\delta_{MK}\right)\left(\frac{\partial U_N}{\partial X_L}+\delta_{NL}\right)-\delta_{KL}\right] \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_K}+\delta_{MK}\right)\left(\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_L}+\delta_{ML}\right)-\delta_{KL}\right] \\
&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial U_K}{\partial X_L}+\frac{\partial U_L}{\partial X_K}+\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_K}\frac{\partial U_M}{\partial X_L}\right)
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the Eulerian-Almansi finite strain tensor can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;e_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} +\frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}-\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_j}\right)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Doyle and J.L. Eriksen (1956). "Non-linear elasticity." ''Advances in Applied Mechanics'' 4, 53–115.&lt;/ref&gt; can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf E_{(m)}=\frac{1}{2m}(\mathbf U^{2m}- \mathbf I) = \frac{1}{2m}\left[\mathbf{C}^{m} - \mathbf{I}\right]\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

For different values of &lt;math&gt;m\,\!&lt;/math&gt; we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathbf E_{(1)}&amp;=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf U^{2}- \mathbf I) = \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{C}-\mathbf{I}) &amp; \qquad \text{Green-Lagrangian strain tensor}\\
 \mathbf E_{(1/2)}&amp;=(\mathbf U- \mathbf I) = \mathbf{C}^{1/2}-\mathbf{I}&amp; \qquad \text{Biot strain tensor}\\
\mathbf E_{(0)}&amp;=\ln \mathbf U = \frac{1}{2}\,\ln\mathbf{C} &amp; \qquad \text{Logarithmic strain, Natural strain, True strain, or Hencky strain} \\
 \mathbf{E}_{(-1)} &amp; = \frac{1}{2}\left[\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{U}^{-2}\right] &amp; \qquad \text{Almansi strain}
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The second-order approximation of these tensors is
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{E}_{(m)} = \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} + {\tfrac 1 2}(\nabla\mathbf{u})^T\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u} - (1 - m) \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^T\cdot\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; is the infinitesimal strain tensor.

Many other different definitions of tensors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; are admissible, provided that they all satisfy the conditions that:&lt;ref name="BazCed91"&gt;Z.P. Bažant and L. Cedolin (1991). ''Stability of Structures. Elastic, Inelastic, Fracture and Damage Theories.'' Oxford Univ. Press, New York (2nd ed. Dover Publ., New York 2003; 3rd ed., World Scientific 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; vanishes for all rigid-body motions
* the dependence of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; on the displacement gradient tensor &lt;math&gt;\nabla\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, continuously differentiable and monotonic
* it is also desired that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; reduces to the infinitesimal strain tensor &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; as the norm &lt;math&gt;|\nabla\mathbf{u}| \to 0&lt;/math&gt;

An example is the set of tensors 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{E}^{(n)} = \left({\mathbf U}^n - {\mathbf U}^{-n}\right)/2n
 &lt;/math&gt;
which do not belong to the Seth–Hill class, but have the same 2nd-order approximation as the Seth–Hill measures at &lt;math&gt;m=0&lt;/math&gt; for any value of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Baz98"&gt;Z.P.

==Stretch ratio==
The '''stretch ratio''' is a measure of the extensional or normal strain of a differential line element, which can be defined at either the undeformed configuration or the deformed configuration.

The stretch ratio for the differential element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X=dX\mathbf N\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure) in the direction of the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N\,\!&lt;/math&gt; at the material point &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, in the undeformed configuration, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{(\mathbf N)}=\frac{dx}{dX}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;dx\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the deformed magnitude of the differential element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, the stretch ratio for the differential element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x=dx\mathbf n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure), in the direction of the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; at the material point &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, in the deformed configuration, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\Lambda_{(\mathbf n)}}=\frac{dX}{dx}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The normal strain  &lt;math&gt;e_{\mathbf N}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in any direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N\,\!&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a function of the stretch ratio,

:&lt;math&gt;e_{(\mathbf N)}=\frac{dx-dX}{dX}=\Lambda_{(\mathbf N)}-1.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This equation implies that the normal strain is zero, i.e. no deformation, when the stretch is equal to unity. Some materials, such as elastometers can sustain stretch ratios of 3 or 4 before they fail, whereas traditional engineering materials, such as concrete or steel, fail at much lower stretch ratios, perhaps of the order of 1.1 (reference?)

==Physical interpretation of the finite strain tensor==

The diagonal components &lt;math&gt;E_{KL}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; of the Lagrangian finite strain tensor are related to the normal strain, e.g.

:&lt;math&gt;E_{11}=e_{(\mathbf I_1)}+\frac{1}{2}e_{(\mathbf I_1)}^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e_{(\mathbf I_1)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the normal strain or engineering strain in the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The off-diagonal components &lt;math&gt;E_{KL}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; of the Lagrangian finite strain tensor are related to shear strain, e.g.

:&lt;math&gt;E_{12}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2E_{11}+1}\sqrt{2E_{22}+1}\sin\phi_{12}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi_{12}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the angle between two line elements that were originally perpendicular with directions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

Under certain circumstances, i.e. small displacements and small displacement rates, the components of the Lagrangian finite strain tensor may be approximated by the components of the [[Infinitesimal strain theory#Infinitesimal strain tensor|infinitesimal strain tensor]]

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{(\mathbf N)}=\frac{dx}{dX}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;dx\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the deformed magnitude of the differential element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, the stretch ratio for the differential element &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x=dx\mathbf n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; (Figure), in the direction of the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n\,\!&lt;/math&gt; at the material point &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, in the deformed configuration, is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\Lambda_{(\mathbf n)}}=\frac{dX}{dx}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The square of the stretch ratio is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{(\mathbf N)}^2=\left (\frac{dx}{dX}\right )^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing that

:&lt;math&gt;(dx)^2=C_{KL}dX_KdX_L\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

we have

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{(\mathbf N)}^2=C_{KL}N_KN_L\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_K\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N_L\,\!&lt;/math&gt; are unit vectors.

The normal strain or engineering strain  &lt;math&gt;e_{\mathbf N}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in any direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf N\,\!&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as a function of the stretch ratio,

:&lt;math&gt;e_{(\mathbf N)}=\frac{dx-dX}{dX}=\Lambda_{(\mathbf N)}-1\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the normal strain in the direction &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; at the material point &lt;math&gt;P\,\!&lt;/math&gt; may be expressed in terms of the stretch ratio as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
e_{(\mathbf I_1)}=\frac{dx_1-dX_1}{dX_1}&amp;=\Lambda_{(\mathbf I_1)}-1\\
&amp;=\sqrt {C_{11}} -1=\sqrt{\delta_{11}+2E_{11}}-1\\
&amp;=\sqrt{1+2E_{11}}-1\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

solving for &lt;math&gt;E_{11}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; we have

&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
2E_{11}&amp;= \frac{(dx_1)^2 - (dX_1)^2}{(dX_1)^2} \\
E_{11}&amp;= \left(\frac{dx_1-dX_1}{dX_1}\right)+ \frac {1}{2} \left(\frac{dx_1-dX_1}{dX_1}\right)^2 \\
&amp;=e_{(\mathbf I_1)}+\frac{1}{2}e_{(\mathbf I_1)}^2\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The ''shear strain'', or change in angle between two line elements &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf X_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; initially perpendicular, and oriented in the principal directions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, respectivelly, can also be expressed as a function of the stretch ratio. From the [[dot product]] between the deformed lines &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d\mathbf x_1 \cdot d\mathbf x_2&amp;=dx_1dx_2\cos\theta_{12} \\
\mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X_1\cdot \mathbf F\cdot d\mathbf X_2&amp;= \sqrt {d\mathbf X_1 \cdot \mathbf F^T\cdot\mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X_1}\cdot \sqrt {d\mathbf X_2 \cdot \mathbf F^T\cdot\mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X_2} \cos\theta_{12} \\
\frac{d\mathbf X_1\cdot \mathbf F^T\cdot\mathbf F\cdot d\mathbf X_2}{dX_1dX_2}&amp;=\frac{\sqrt {d\mathbf X_1 \cdot \mathbf F^T\cdot\mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X_1}\cdot \sqrt {d\mathbf X_2 \cdot \mathbf F^T\cdot\mathbf F \cdot d\mathbf X_2}}{dX_1dX_2}\cos\theta_{12}\\
\mathbf I_1 \cdot \mathbf C \cdot \mathbf I_2&amp;= \Lambda_{\mathbf I_1}\Lambda_{\mathbf I_2}\cos\theta_{12}\\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta_{12}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the lines &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x_1\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf x_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in the deformed configuration. Defining &lt;math&gt;\phi_{12}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as the shear strain or reduction in the angle between two line elements that were originally perpendicular, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{12}=\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta_{12}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_{12}=\sin\phi_{12}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf I_1 \cdot \mathbf C \cdot \mathbf I_2= \Lambda_{\mathbf I_1}\Lambda_{\mathbf I_2}\sin\phi_{12}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
C_{12}&amp;=\sqrt{C_{11}}\sqrt{C_{22}}\sin\phi_{12}\\
2E_{12}+\delta_{12}&amp;=\sqrt{2E_{11}+1}\sqrt{2E_{22}+1}\sin\phi_{12}\\
E_{12}&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2E_{11}+1}\sqrt{2E_{22}+1}\sin\phi_{12}\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

== Deformation tensors in convected curvilinear coordinates ==
A representation of deformation tensors in [[curvilinear coordinates]] is useful for many problems in continuum mechanics such as nonlinear shell theories and large plastic deformations.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{x}(\xi^1,\xi^2,\xi^3)&lt;/math&gt; denote the function by which a position vector in space is constructed from coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\xi^1,\xi^2,\xi^3)&lt;/math&gt;. The coordinates are said to be "convected" if they correspond to a one-to-one mapping to and from Lagrangian particles in a continuum body. If the coordinate grid is "painted" on the body in its initial configuration, then this grid will deform and flow with the motion of material to remain painted on the same material particles in the deformed configuration so that grid lines intersect at the same material particle in either configuration.  The tangent vector to the deformed coordinate grid line curve &lt;math&gt;\xi^i&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{g}_i = \frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial \xi^i}
&lt;/math&gt;
The three tangent vectors at &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; form a local basis.  These vectors are related the reciprocal basis vectors by 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{g}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}^j = \delta_i^j
&lt;/math&gt;

Let us define a second-order tensor field &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{g}&lt;/math&gt; (also called the [[metric tensor]]) with components
:&lt;math&gt;
   g_{ij} := \frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial \xi^i}\cdot\frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial \xi^j} = \mathbf{g}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}_j
&lt;/math&gt;
The [[curvilinear coordinates|Christoffel symbols of the first kind]] can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Gamma_{ijk}
      = \tfrac{1}{2}[(\mathbf{g}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}_k)_{,j} + (\mathbf{g}_j\cdot\mathbf{g}_k)_{,i} - (\mathbf{g}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}_j)_{,k}]
&lt;/math&gt;

To see how the Christoffel symbols are related to the Right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor let us similarly define two bases, the already mentioned one that is tangent to deformed grid lines and another that is tangent to the undeformed grid lines. Namely,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{G}_i := \frac{\partial \mathbf{X}}{\partial \xi^i} ~;~~ \mathbf{G}_i\cdot\mathbf{G}^j = \delta_i^j ~;~~ \mathbf{g}_i := \frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial \xi^i}  ~;~~ \mathbf{g}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}^j = \delta_i^j
&lt;/math&gt;

=== The deformation gradient in curvilinear coordinates ===
Using the definition of the [[curvilinear coordinates|gradient of a vector field]] in curvilinear coordinates, the deformation gradient can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{F} = \boldsymbol{\nabla}_{\mathbf{X}}\mathbf{x} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial \xi^i}\otimes\mathbf{G}^i = \mathbf{g}_i\otimes\mathbf{G}^i
&lt;/math&gt;

=== The right Cauchy–Green tensor in curvilinear coordinates ===
The right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{C} = \boldsymbol{F}^T\cdot\boldsymbol{F} = (\mathbf{G}^i\otimes\mathbf{g}_i)\cdot(\mathbf{g}_j\otimes\mathbf{G}^j)
       = (\mathbf{g}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}_j)(\mathbf{G}^i\otimes\mathbf{G}^j)
&lt;/math&gt;
If we express &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of components with respect to the basis {&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}^i&lt;/math&gt;} we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{C} = C_{ij}~\mathbf{G}^i\otimes\mathbf{G}^j
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, 
:&lt;math&gt;
  C_{ij} = \mathbf{g}_i\cdot\mathbf{g}_j = g_{ij}
 &lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding Christoffel symbol of the first kind may be written in the following form.
:&lt;math&gt;
   \Gamma_{ijk} 
      = \tfrac{1}{2}[C_{ik,j} + C_{jk,i} - C_{ij,k}]
      = \tfrac{1}{2}[(\mathbf{G}_i\cdot\boldsymbol{C}\cdot\mathbf{G}_k)_{,j} + (\mathbf{G}_j\cdot\boldsymbol{C}\cdot\mathbf{G}_k)_{,i} - (\mathbf{G}_i\cdot\boldsymbol{C}\cdot\mathbf{G}_j)_{,k}]
&lt;/math&gt;

===Some relations between deformation measures and Christoffel symbols===
Let us consider a one-to-one mapping from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = \{X^1,X^2,X^3\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \{x^1,x^2,x^3\}&lt;/math&gt; and let us assume that there exist two positive-definite, symmetric second-order tensor fields &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{G}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{g}&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy
:&lt;math&gt;
   G_{ij} = \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j}~g_{\alpha\beta} 
&lt;/math&gt;
Then,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{\partial G_{ij}}{\partial x^k} = \left(\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^k}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} +
       \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\beta}{\partial x^j \partial x^k}\right)~g_{\alpha\beta} +
       \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j}~\frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial x^k}
&lt;/math&gt;
Noting that
:&lt;math&gt;
   \frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial x^k} = \frac{\partial X^\gamma}{\partial x^k}~\frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial X^\gamma}
&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;g_{\alpha\beta} = g_{\beta\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  \frac{\partial G_{ij}}{\partial x^k} &amp; = \left(\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^k}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} +
       \frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^j \partial x^k}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^i}\right)~g_{\alpha\beta} +
       \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\gamma}{\partial x^k}~\frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial X^\gamma} \\
  \frac{\partial G_{ik}}{\partial x^j} &amp; = \left(\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^k} +
       \frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^j \partial x^k}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^i}\right)~g_{\alpha\beta} +
       \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^k}~\frac{\partial X^\gamma}{\partial x^j}~\frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial X^\gamma} \\
  \frac{\partial G_{jk}}{\partial x^i} &amp; = \left(\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^k} +
       \frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^k}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j}\right)~g_{\alpha\beta} +
       \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^k}~\frac{\partial X^\gamma}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial X^\gamma} 
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Define
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
   _{(x)}\Gamma_{ijk} &amp; := \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial G_{ik}}{\partial x^j} + \frac{\partial G_{jk}}{\partial x^i} - \frac{\partial G_{ij}}{\partial x^k}\right) \\
   _{(X)}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} &amp; := \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial g_{\alpha\gamma}}{\partial X^\beta} + \frac{\partial g_{\beta\gamma}}{\partial X^\alpha} - \frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial X^\gamma}\right) \\
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Hence
:&lt;math&gt;
  _{(x)}\Gamma_{ijk} = \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\gamma}{\partial x^k} \,_{(X)}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} + \frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^k}~g_{\alpha\beta}
&lt;/math&gt;
Define
:&lt;math&gt;
   [G^{ij}] = [G_{ij}]^{-1} ~;~~ [g^{\alpha\beta}] = [g_{\alpha\beta}]^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;
   G^{ij} = \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial X^\alpha}~\frac{\partial x^j}{\partial X^\beta}~g^{\alpha\beta}
&lt;/math&gt;
Define the Christoffel symbols of the second kind as
:&lt;math&gt;
  _{(x)}\Gamma^m_{ij} := G^{mk} \,_{(x)}\Gamma_{ijk} ~;~~
  _{(X)}\Gamma^\nu_{\alpha\beta} := g^{\nu\gamma} \,_{(X)}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} 
&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  _{(x)}\Gamma^m_{ij} &amp; =  G^{mk}~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\gamma}{\partial x^k} \,_{(X)}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} + G^{mk}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^k}~g_{\alpha\beta} \\
   &amp; =  \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\frac{\partial x^k}{\partial X^\rho}~g^{\nu\rho}~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\gamma}{\partial x^k} \,_{(X)}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} + 
   \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\frac{\partial x^k}{\partial X^\rho}~g^{\nu\rho}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^k}~g_{\alpha\beta} \\
   &amp; =  \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\delta^\gamma_\rho~g^{\nu\rho}~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} + 
   \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\delta^\beta_\rho~g^{\nu\rho}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}~g_{\alpha\beta} \\
   &amp; =  \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~g^{\nu\gamma}~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma_{\alpha\beta\gamma} + 
   \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~g^{\nu\beta}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}~g_{\alpha\beta} \\
   &amp; =  \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\nu_{\alpha\beta} + 
   \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\delta^{\nu}_{\alpha}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} 
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
  _{(x)}\Gamma^m_{ij} =  \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\nu_{\alpha\beta} + 
   \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\alpha}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} 
&lt;/math&gt;
The invertibility of the mapping implies that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
  \frac{\partial X^\mu}{\partial x^m}\,_{(x)}\Gamma^m_{ij} &amp; =  \frac{\partial X^\mu}{\partial x^m}~\frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\nu}~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\nu_{\alpha\beta} + 
   \frac{\partial X^\mu}{\partial x^m}~\frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\alpha}~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} \\
   &amp; =  \delta^\mu_\nu~\frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\nu_{\alpha\beta} + 
   \delta^\mu_\alpha~\frac{\partial^2 X^\alpha}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} \\
   &amp; =  \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} + \frac{\partial^2 X^\mu}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} 
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
We can also formulate a similar result in terms of derivatives with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
\frac{\partial^2 X^\mu}{\partial x^i \partial x^j} &amp; = \frac{\partial X^\mu}{\partial x^m}\,_{(x)}\Gamma^m_{ij} - \frac{\partial X^\alpha}{\partial x^i}~\frac{\partial X^\beta}{\partial x^j} \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} \\
\frac{\partial^2 x^m}{\partial X^\alpha \partial X^\beta} &amp; = \frac{\partial x^m}{\partial X^\mu}\,_{(X)}\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} - \frac{\partial x^i}{\partial X^\alpha}~\frac{\partial x^j}{\partial X^\beta} \,_{(x)}\Gamma^m_{ij}
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Compatibility conditions ==
{{Main|Compatibility (mechanics)}}
The problem of compatibility in continuum mechanics involves the determination of allowable single-valued continuous fields on bodies.  These allowable conditions leave the body without unphysical gaps or overlaps after a deformation.  Most such conditions apply to simply-connected bodies.  Additional conditions are required for the internal boundaries of multiply connected bodies.

=== Compatibility of the deformation gradient ===
The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a compatible &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}&lt;/math&gt; field over a simply connected body are
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{\nabla}\times\boldsymbol{F} = \boldsymbol{0}
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Compatibility of the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor ===
The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a compatible &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C}&lt;/math&gt; field over a simply connected body are
:&lt;math&gt;
  R^\gamma_{\alpha\beta\rho} := 
   \frac{\partial }{\partial X^\rho}[\,_{(X)}\Gamma^\gamma_{\alpha\beta}] -
   \frac{\partial }{\partial X^\beta}[\,_{(X)}\Gamma^\gamma_{\alpha\rho}] +
  \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\gamma_{\mu\rho}\,_{(X)}\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} - 
  \,_{(X)}\Gamma^\gamma_{\mu\beta}\,_{(X)}\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\rho} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
We can show these are the mixed components of the [[Riemann–Christoffel curvature tensor]]. Therefore, the necessary conditions for &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{C}&lt;/math&gt;-compatibility are that the Riemann–Christoffel curvature of the deformation is zero.

=== Compatibility of the left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor ===
No general sufficiency conditions are known for the left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor in three-dimensions.  Compatibility conditions for two-dimensional &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{B}&lt;/math&gt; fields have been found by Janet Blume.&lt;ref name=Blume&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blume, J.

{{nihongo|'''''Genchi Genbutsu'''''|現地現物}} means "Go and See” and it is a key principle of the [[Toyota Production System]]. It suggests that in order to truly understand a situation one needs to go to ''[[genba]]'' (現場) or, the "real place" - where work is done.

==Application==
[[Taiichi Ohno]], creator of the Toyota Production System is credited, perhaps apocryphally, with taking new graduates to the shopfloor and drawing a chalk circle on the floor. The graduate would be told to stand in the circle, observe and note what he saw. When Ohno returned he would check; if the graduate had not seen enough he would be asked to keep observing. Ohno was trying to imprint upon his future engineers that the only way to truly understand what happens on the shop floor was to go there. It was where value was added and waste could be observed. 

Genchi Genbutsu is therefore a key approach in problem solving. If the problem exists on the shop floor then it needs to be understood and solved at the shop floor. 

Genchi Genbutsu is also called [[Gemba]] attitude. Gemba is the Japanese term for "the place" in this case "the place where it actually happens". Since real value is created at the shop floor in manufacturing, this is where managers need to spend their time.

Genchi Genbutsu is sometimes referred to as "Getcha boots on" (and go out and see what is happening) due to its similar cadence and meaning. It has been compared to [[Tom Peters|Peters]] and [[Robert H. Waterman Jr|Waterman's]] idea of "[[Management By Wandering Around]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pmhut.com/management-by-wandering-around-mbwa | title = Management by Wandering Around | author= Noel W. Hinners |date = October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept quickly became so universal that new managers instinctively knew that they had to "walk around" to achieve high effectiveness levels. Whilst these ideas, with their associated lists of how-tos, are probably good ideas they may miss the essential nature of Genchi Genbutsu which is less to "visit" and more to "know" by being there. Toyota has high levels of management presence on the production line whose role is to "know" and to constantly improve.

== Implementation ==

"Gemba attitude" reflects the idea that whatever reports, measures and ideas are transmitted to management are only an abstraction of what is actually going on in the ''genba'' to create value. Metrics and reports will reflect the attitudes of the management questioner and the workplace responder as well as how the responder views the questioner. It also increases the chance that actual issues and unplanned events will be observed first hand and can be managed immediately; this includes issues that are not apparent to the ''genba'' workforce.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6711">'''Hongaku''' ({{cjkv|c=本覺|p=běnjué|rr=bongak}}) is an [[East Asian Buddhism|East Asian Buddhist doctrine]] often translated as "inherent", "innate", "intrinsic" or "original" [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] and is the view that all sentient beings already are enlightened or awakened in some way. It is closely tied with the concept of [[Buddha-nature]].

==Origins and development==
The doctrine of innate enlightenment was developed in China out of the Buddha-nature doctrine. It is first mentioned in the [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]] scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Sueki Fumihiko, "Two Seemingly Contradictory Aspects of the Teaching of Innate Enlightenment (hongaku) in Medieval Japan", Japanese Journal of Religious Study 22 (1-2), pp. 3-16, 1995. [https://web.archive.org/web/20131112093012/http://enlight.lib.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-MAG/mag32125.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacqueline Stone, The awakening of faith in the Mahayana sees original enlightenment as "true [[tathātā|suchness]] considered under the aspect of conventional deluded consciousness and thus denotes the potential for enlightenment in unenlightened beings."&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Jacqueline|title=Medieval Tendai hongaku thought and the new Kamakura Buddhism: A reconsideration|journal=Japanese Journal of Religious Studies|date=1 May 1995|volume=22|issue=1-2|url=https://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2559|doi=10.18874/jjrs.22.1-2.1995.17-48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval China, the doctrine developed from the [[Huayan]] school and also influenced [[Chan Buddhism]].

The doctrine is also a common theme of the ''[[Platform Sutra]]'' of [[Huineng]] and was taught by Chinese Chan masters as "seeing original nature". Inherent enlightenment was often associated with the teachings of [[subitism| sudden enlightenment]] and contrasted with the "gradual" approach and the idea of “acquired enlightenment” or ''shikaku''. The first Japanese to write of this doctrine was [[Kūkai]] (774–835), founder of [[Shingon Buddhism]].

==In Japanese Buddhism==
The doctrine of innate enlightenment was very influential in [[Tendai]] from the [[cloistered rule]] era (1086–1185) through the [[Edo period]] (1688–1735).&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt; The Tendai view of hongaku saw it as encompassing not only all sentient beings, but all living things and all nature, even inanimate objects - all were considered to be Buddha. This also includes all our actions and thoughts, even our deluded thoughts, as expressions of our innately enlightened nature.&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt;

Tamura Yoshirõ (1921–1989) saw original {{Nihongo|enlightenment thought|本覺思想|hongaku shisō}} as being defined by two major philosophical elements.&lt;ref&gt; Tamura Yoshirō (1987), Japanese culture and the Tendai concept of original enlightenment, Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 14 (2-3), 203-205 [https://web.archive.org/web/20131229102232/http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/nfile/2355 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; One was a radical non-dualism, in which everything was seen as empty and interconnected, so that the differences between ordinary person and Buddha and all other distinctions, were ontologically negated. The other feature of hongaku was the affirmation of the phenomenal world as an expression of the nondual realm of Buddha nature. This was expressed in phrases such as “the worldly passions are precisely enlightenment” and “birth and death are precisely nirvana.”&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt;

The Tendai doctrine of hongaku had deep impact on the development of [[Kamakura period#Flourishing of Buddhism|New Kamakura Buddhism]], for many of those who founded new Kamakura Buddhist schools (Eisai, Honen, Shinran, Dogen and Nichiren) studied Tendai at [[Mount Hiei]].&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt;

During the 1980s a Japanese movement known as [[Critical Buddhism]] has attacked original enlightenment as an ideology that supports the status quo and legitimates social injustice by accepting all things as they are as expressions of original Buddha nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15690">'''Hylozoism''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] point of view that [[matter]] is in some sense alive. The concept dates back at least as far as the [[Milesian school]] of [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers. The term was introduced to [[English language|English]] by [[Ralph Cudworth]] in 1678.

==Distinction from similar theories==
Although there is a distinction between possessing a mind ([[panpsychism|hylopsychism]]) and possessing life (hylozoism); in practice this division is difficult to maintain, because the ancient hylozoists not only regarded the spirits of the [[matter|material]] universe and plant world as alive, but also as more or less [[Consciousness|conscious]]. Whereas [[animism]] tends to view life as taking the form of discrete [[soul|spirits]], and panpsychism tends to refer to strictly philosophical views like that of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], hylozoism refers largely to views such as those of the earliest Greek philosophers (6th and 5th centuries BC), who treated the magnet as alive because of its attractive powers ([[Thales]]), or air as divine ([[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]), perhaps because of its apparently spontaneous power of movement, or because of its essentiality for life in animals. Later this primitive hylozoism reappeared in modified forms.  Some scholars {{who|date=June 2015}} have since claimed that the term ''hylozoism'' should properly be used only where body and soul are explicitly distinguished, the distinction then being rejected as invalid.  Nevertheless, hylozoism remains logically distinct both from early forms of animism, which personify nature, and from panpsychism, which attributes some form of consciousness or sensation to all matter.

== Ancient hylozoism ==
Some of the ancient [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers taught a version of hylozoism, as they, however vaguely, conceived the elemental matter as being in some sense animate if not actually conscious and {{not a typo|[[conative]]}} (a directed effort, a striving or tendency; a ''[[wikt:nisus|nisus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=(CD-ROM ver. 3.0) 2nd |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |quote=1. An effort, endeavour, striving. 2. ''transf''. A force, impulse, or tendency simulating human effort; a nisus.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thales]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], and [[Heraclitus]] all taught that there is a form of life in all material objects,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Burnet (classicist)|J.Burnet]], [http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/burnet/egp.htm?chapter=introduction#8 ''Early Greek Philosophy'', Introduction, VIII, note 29]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed that a ''[[Anima mundi|world soul]]'' was the vital force of the universe. Note that these philosophies did not necessarily hold that material objects had ''separate life'' or ''identity'', only that they had life, either as part of an overriding entity or as living but insensible entities.

== In Renaissance and early Modernity ==
In the [[Renaissance]], [[Bernardino Telesio]], [[Paracelsus]], [[Cardanus]],  and [[Giordano Bruno]] revived the doctrine of hylozoism.  The latter, for example, held a form of [[Christian]] [[pantheism]], wherein [[God]] is the source, cause, medium, and end of all things, and therefore all things are participatory in the ongoing Godhead.  Bruno's ideas were so radical that he was entirely rejected by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as well as excommunicated from a few Protestant groups, and he was eventually burned at the stake for various heresies. Telesio, on the other hand, began from an [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] basis and, through radical [[empiricism]], came to believe that a living force was what informed all matter.  Instead of the intellectual universals of Aristotle, he believed that life generated form.

In [[England]], some of the [[Cambridge Platonists]] approached hylozoism as well. Both [[Henry More]] and [[Ralph Cudworth]] (''the Younger'', 1617–1688), through their reconciliation of Platonic [[idealism]] with Christian doctrines of deific generation, came to see the divine lifeforce as the informing principle in the world. Thus, like Bruno, but not nearly to the extreme, they saw God's generative impulse as giving life to all things that exist. Accordingly, Cudworth, the most systematic metaphysician of the Cambridge Platonist tradition, fought hylozoism. His work is primarily a critique of what he took to be the two principal forms of atheism—materialism and hylozoism.

Cudworth singled out Hobbes not only as a defender of the hylozoic atheism "which attributes life to matter", but also as one going beyond it and defending "hylopathian atheism, which attributes all to matter." Cudworth attempted to show that Hobbes had revived the doctrines of [[Protagoras]] and was therefore subject to the criticisms which [[Plato]] had deployed against Protagoras in the [[Theaetetus (dialogue)|''Theaetetus'']]. On the side of hylozoism, [[Strato of Lampsacus]] was the official target. However, Cudworth's Dutch friends had reported to him the views which [[Spinoza]] was circulating in manuscript. Cudworth remarks in his ''Preface'' that he would have ignored hylozoism had he not been aware that a new version of it would shortly be published.&lt;ref&gt;''The True Intellectual System of the Universe: The First part; wherein, All the Reason and Philosophy of Atheism is Confuted; and Its Impossibility Demonstrated''. By Ralph Cudworth, D.D. London, Printed for Richard Royston, 1678&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's idealism also tends toward hylozoism.  In order to hold a balance even between matter and mind, Spinoza combined materialistic with pantheistic hylozoism, by demoting both to mere attributes of the one infinite substance.  Although specifically rejecting identity in inorganic matter, he, like the Cambridge Platonists, sees a life force within, as well as beyond, all matter.

== Contemporary hylozoism ==
[[Immanuel Kant]] presented arguments against hylozoism in the third chapter of his ''Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Naturwissenschaften'' ("First Metaphysical Principles of Natural Science," 1786) and also in his famous ''Kritik der reinen Vernunft'' ("Critique of Pure Reason," 1783).  Yet, in our times, scientific hylozoism – whether modified, or keeping the trend to make all beings conform to some uniform pattern, to which the concept was adhered in [[modernity]] by [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Hermann Lotze]], and [[Ernst Heinrich Haeckel|Ernst Haeckel]] – was often called upon as a protest against a [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] worldview.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.rz.hu-berlin.de/phil/kantkongress/14/look.html Hylozoism and Dogmatism in Kant, Leibniz, and Newton]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, Haeckel developed a [[materialism|materialist]] form of hylozoism, specially against [[Rudolf Virchow]]'s and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s mechanical views of humans and nature.  In his ''Die Welträtsel'' of 1899 (''The Riddle of the Universe'' 1901), Haeckel upheld a unity of organic and inorganic nature and derived all actions of both types of matter from natural causes and laws.  Thus, his form of hylozoism reverses the usual course by maintaining that living and nonliving things are essentially the same, and by erasing the distinction between the two and stipulating that they behave by a single set of laws.

In contrast, the Argentine-German [[Neuroscience|neurobiological]] tradition terms ''hylozoic hiatus'' all of the parts of nature which can only behave lawfully or nomically and, upon such a feature, are described as lying outside of minds and amid them – i.e. extramentally.  Thereby the hylozoic hiatus becomes contraposed to minds deemed able of behaving semoviently, i.e. able of inaugurating new causal series ([[semovience]]).  Hylozoism in this contemporary neurobiological tradition is thus restricted to the portions of nature behaving nomically inside the minds, namely the minds' sensory reactions ([[Christfried Jakob]]'s "sensory intonations") whereby minds react to the stimuli coming from the hylozoic hiatus or extramental realm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electroneubio.secyt.gov.ar/commentl.htm Comment l’ hylozoïsme scientifique contemporain aborde-t-il la sélection naturelle du parenchyme neurocognitif?] (French)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cogprints.org/4662|title=On Minds' Localization|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Buber]] too takes an approach that is quasi-hylozoic.  By maintaining that the essence of things is identifiable and separate, although not pre-existing, he can see a soul within each thing.

The French Pythagorean and Rosicrucian alchemist, Francois Jollivet-Castelot (1874-1937), established a hylozoic esoteric school which combined the insight of spagyrics, chemistry, physics, transmutations and metaphysics. He published many books, one of which was called "L’Hylozoïsme, l’alchimie, les chimistes unitaires" (1896). In his view there was no difference between spirit and matter except for the degree of frequency and other vibrational conditions.

The [[Mormon theology|Mormon theologian]] [[Orson Pratt]] taught a form of hylozoism.

[[Alice A. Bailey]] wrote a book called ''The Consciousness of the Atom''.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''The Consciousness of the Atom''—1922&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by Alice A. Bailey, [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], and their predecessor [[Madame Blavatsky]], [[Henry T. Laurency]] produced voluminous writings describing a hylozoic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction to the Works of Henry T. Laurency". ''The Official Website of the Henry T. Laurency Publishing Foundation''. Henry T. Laurency Publishing Foundation. 12 July 2009 &lt;http://www.laurency.com/introduc.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[George Ivanovich Gurdjieff]], the English philosopher and mathematician [[John Godolphin Bennett]], in his four-volume work ''The Dramatic Universe'' and his book ''Energies'', developed a six-dimensional framework in which matter-energy takes on 12 levels of hylozoic quality.

[[Ken Wilber]] embraces hylozoism to explain  [[subjective experience]] and provides terms describing the ladder of subjective experience experienced by entities from [[atom]]s up to [[Human being]]s in the ''upper left quadrant'' of his [[Integral (philosophy)|Integral philosophy]] chart.&lt;ref&gt;Wilber Ken ''A Brief History of Everything'', 1st ed. 1996, 2nd ed. 2001: {{ISBN|1-57062-740-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist Thomas Brophy, in The Mechanism Demands a Mysticism, embraces hylozoism as the basis of a framework for re-integrating modern physical science with perennial spiritual philosophy.  Brophy coins two additional words to stand with hylozoism as the three possible ontological stances consistent with modern physics.  Thus: hylostatism (universe is deterministic, thus “static” in a four-dimensional sense); hylostochastism (universe contains a fundamentally random or stochastic component); hylozoism (universe contains a fundamentally alive aspect).

Architect [[Christopher Alexander]] has put forth a theory of the living universe, where life is viewed as a pervasive patterning that extends to what is normally considered non-living things, notably buildings.  He wrote a four-volume work called ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' which explicates this theory in detail.

Philosopher and ecologist [[David Abram]] articulates and elaborates a form of hylozoism grounded in the [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] of sensory experience. In his books ''Becoming Animal'' and ''The Spell of the Sensuous,'' Abram suggests that matter is never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that material things actively "solicit our attention" or "call our focus," coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science as well as the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it calls us back to our senses and to the primacy of the sensuous terrain,  enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us.&lt;ref&gt;Abram, David ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World'', Pantheon, 1996; Vintage 1997: {{ISBN|978-0-679-77639-0}} and Abram, David: ''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology'' Pantheon, 2010; Vintage 2011: {{ISBN|978-0-375-71369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruno Latour]]'s [[actor-network theory]], in the sociology of science, treats non-living things as active agents and thus bears some metaphorical resemblance to hylozoism.&lt;ref&gt;Latour, Bruno ''Pandora's Hope: Essays on the reality of Science Studies'', 1999: {{ISBN|0-674-65335-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Literature]]'''
*In mathematician and writer [[Rudy Rucker]]'s novels ''Postsingular'' and ''Hylozoic'', the emergent sentience of all material things is described as a property of the [[technological singularity]].
*The ''Hylozoist'' is one of the Culture ships mentioned in Iain M. Banks's novel ''[[Surface Detail]]'' – appropriately, this ship is a member of the branch of Contact dealing with [[Hegemonising swarm|smart matter]] outbreaks.
'''[[MMORPG]]s''' 
*The monster "Hylozoist" (sometimes spelled "Heirozoist") in the MMORPG ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'' is a plush rabbit doll with its mouth sewn shut, possessed by the spirit of a child. Although hylozoism has nothing to do with possession, it is clear that the name was derived from this ancient philosophy.
'''[[Music]]'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3860">The  '''imperial ban''' ({{lang-de|Reichsacht}}) was a form of [[outlaw]]ry in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Starn|1982|p=23}} At different times, it could be declared by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], by the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], or by courts like the [[League of the Holy Court]] (''Vehmgericht'') or the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]''.

People under imperial ban, known as ''Geächtete'' (from about the 17th century, colloquially also as ''Vogelfreierei'', lit. "free as a bird"), lost all their rights and possessions. They were legally considered dead, and anyone was allowed to rob, injure or kill them without legal consequences. The imperial ban automatically followed the [[excommunication]] of a person, as well as extending to anyone offering help to a person under the imperial ban.

Those banned could reverse the ban by submitting to the legal authority. The ''Aberacht'', a stronger version of the imperial ban, could not be reversed.

The imperial ban was sometimes imposed on whole [[Imperial State|Imperial Estates]]. In that case, other estates could attack and seek to conquer them. The effect of the ban on a city or other Estate was that it lost its [[Imperial immediacy]] and in the future would have a second overlord in addition to the emperor.

Famous people placed under the imperial ban included:

* 1180 [[Henry the Lion]], for refusing military support to [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] against the cities of the [[Lombard League]].
* 1225 Count [[Frederick of Isenberg]], for killing his uncle [[Engelbert II of Berg]], Archbishop of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]].
* 1235 King [[Henry (VII) of Germany]], for his rebellion against his father the [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]].

{{main|Bottling (concert abuse)}}

==1970s==
* ''[[Metallic K.O.]]'' is an infamous live recording by [[The Stooges]]. During much of the performance, [[Iggy Pop]] sings while pieces of ice, eggs, beer bottles and jelly beans, among other things, are thrown at him in response to his audience-baiting. In the essay "Iggy Pop: Blowtorch in Bondage" critic [[Lester Bangs]] calls the album a "documentation of the Iggy holocaust at its most nihilistically out of control." He describes the Stooges concert he attended that immediately preceded the ''Metallic K.O.'' performances:
{{cquote|''The audience, which consisted largely of bikers, was unusually hostile, and Iggy, as usual, fed on that hostility, soaked it up and gave it back and absorbed it all over again in an eerie, frightening symbiosis. "All right," he finally said, stopping a song in the middle, "you assholes wanta hear 'Louie, Louie,' we'll give you 'Louie, Louie.'" So the Stooges played a forty-five-minute version of "Louie Louie," including new lyrics improvised by the Pop on the spot consisting of "You can suck my ass / You biker faggot sissies," etc.

''By now the hatred in the room is one huge livid wave, and Iggy singles out one heckler who has been particularly abusive: "Listen, asshole, you heckle me one more time and I'm gonna come down there and kick your ass." "Fuck you, you little punk," responds the biker. So Iggy jumps off the stage, runs through the middle of the crowd, and the guy beats the shit out of him, ending the evening's musical festivities by sending the lead singer back to his motel room and a doctor. I walk into the dressing room, where I encounter the manager of the club offering to punch out anybody in the band who will take him on. The next day the bike gang, who call themselves the Scorpions, will phone WABX-FM and promise to kill Iggy and the Stooges if they play the Michigan Palace on Thursday night. They do (play, that is), and nobody gets killed, but ''Metallic K.O.'' is the only rock album I know where you can actually hear hurled beer bottles breaking against guitar strings.''}}

* On June 3, 1977, restless fans threw rocks and bottles at [[Led Zeppelin]] when a concert in [[Tampa, Florida]] ended early due to a thunderstorm, even though the tickets said "rain or shine", resulting in a small riot that left over 100 injured due to [[crowd crushing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=June 3, 1977|url=http://www.ledzeppelin.com/node/789/257|website=Led Zeppelin official site|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1989 a very young [[Texas (band)|Texas]] were opening for [[Simple Minds]] in [[Cardiff Arms Park]]. The band temporarily halted the show due to being continually pelted by a sea of plastic bottles. Lead singer [[Sharleen Spiteri]] angrily chastised the crowd who stopped throwing in response: "Do you think it is alright to throw bottles at a wee lassie up here on stage?" at which point a lone bottle was thrown, it arched through the air towards the band and as was clearly seen on the large stage monitors hit Spiteri directly on the head. A huge cheer went up and a deluge of bottles followed, not letting up until Spiteri and Texas had stormed off stage.{{citation needed|reason=this does not read as a documented event but as an oft exaggerated story from your youth|date=March 2015}}

==1990s==

He then stated that instead, the band were going to donate the shoes to charity. A recording of the incident was included on Pearl Jam's 1993 Fan Club Holiday Single, and the recording of the song "Blood" was included as a [[b-side]] on the [[Daughter (song)|Daughter single]].
* The [[Sex Pistols]] were bottled off stage at Denmark's [[Roskilde Festival]] in 1996. The band left the stage briefly after only two songs but returned to play another three. [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]] asked the crowd to stop; however, bottling continued and the band ended their set with Rotten criticising the crowd for failing to "police themselves".
* On June 17, 1997 at an [[Ozzfest]] event, concert goers began throwing bottles at the bands on stage, smashed box office windows, started fires, and overturned cars after the announcement that [[Ozzy Osbourne]] would not perform.   
* A full bottle of [[Sprite (drink)|Sprite]] was thrown at [[James (band)|James]] as they performed at [[V Festival]] in the mid-'90s.

* During her performance at [[Pinkpop Festival|Pinkpop]] 1998, some people in the audience threw a couple of eggs at Dutch singer [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]]. In response, she took off her shirt and finished her performance in a red bra, as was shown on Dutch television.

* During the [[Woodstock 99]] festival, Canadian folk rock band [[The Tragically Hip]] were pelted with rocks and bottles by audience members who were there to see harder metal acts on the bill like [[Kid Rock]] and [[Rage Against the Machine]].

* [[Daphne and Celeste]] were heavily bottled at the [[Reading Festival]], and left the stage at the start of their last song. [[Pop punk]] favorites [[Blink-182]] were scheduled to follow them later that day.&lt;ref name= daph /&gt; The duo accused the crowd of "Wasting so much food", which was one of the items thrown at them.

===2001===
* [[Marilyn Manson]] Was bottled during [[OzzFest]] at [[The Docks]] in Toronto. A fan threw a water bottle at the stage during the song [[The Nobodies (song)]] just before the end. Immediately bassist [[Twiggy Ramirez]] pointed it out to Marilyn, following that he demanded that the fan who threw it would come come on stage for a "duel". The fan came up and was counted down, he threw the bottle and then was hit with by many more water bottles from the crowd including Marilyn's. Following losing the "duel" Marilyn then said "Who's got the good aim now? You fucking bitch. Get the fuck off my stage, you pussy", then proceeded to play their song [[Rock Is Dead (Marilyn Manson song)|Rock Is Dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gösta Hare|title=Marilyn Manson invites bottle throwing "fan" to the stage.

*[[Josh Homme]] of [[Queens of the Stone Age]] was bottled at the [[Norwegian Wood (music festival)|Norwegian Wood]] concert on June 13.

*Relatively unknown band The FF'ers were bottled heavily at the [[Reading Festival]] after rumours circulated that their set was in fact a [[Foo Fighters]] secret show.

*[[Bring Me the Horizon]] were bottled at the 2008 Reading Festival when appearing as a last-minute replacement for [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], after drummer [[Joey Jordison]] broke his ankle. The band were heavily bottled which caused singer [[Oliver Sykes]], to respond to the abuse by saying "It looks a right mess up here on this stage, you obviously don't like our band but that's okay". Other items thrown were crisps and [[woodchips]] from the floor. A year later the band appeared at the festival again, but as an official act rather than a replacement albeit three stages down to the Festival Republic Stage. They would later return to the main stage, but with a positive reception.
* Later on in the day, American alternative rock band [[The Plain White T's]] were bottled during the early stages of their set. The abuse was put down to the demographic their music was aimed at, as [[Metallica]] were that day's headliners.
* [[Lethal Bizzle]] was heavily bottled during his set at the 2008 [[Download Festival]] as he was the only act on the bill not associated with rock or heavy metal. Other items thrown included hundreds of pots of Müller Rice which were being given free by a vendor on site. Despite this Bizzle completed his set and even came back on stage for an encore.
* Rapper [[Lil' Wayne]] was bottled in [[Stratford, London]] due to his inactivity on stage, where he reacted by telling the audience the show was over.

The band also endured bottling incidents throughout other songs as well as numerous offensive gestures from members of the crowd and verbal satisfaction from the crowd upon leaving the stage at the end of their set.

{{original research|date=October 2017}}
{{refimprove|date=October 2017}}
This section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains those cases that occurred at [[kindergarten]]s, [[school]]s and [[University|universities]], as well as their affiliated buildings. If the perpetrator was a member of the school staff and the victims primarily his colleagues, the case is not included here, but it is added to the [[List of rampage killers: Workplace killings|list of rampage workplace killings]].

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the table are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]]. &lt;!--Additions should be made 1) in order of # of fatalities, and 2) # injured--&gt;

[[Image:LogLog exponentials.svg|thumb|A log–log plot of ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;(blue), ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(green), and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(red).&lt;br&gt;Note the logarithmic scale markings on each of the axes, and that the log&amp;nbsp;''x'' and log&amp;nbsp;''y'' axes (where the logarithms are 0) are where ''x'' and ''y'' themselves are 1.]]
In [[science]] and [[engineering]], a '''log–log graph''' or '''log–log plot''' is a two-dimensional graph of numerical data that uses [[logarithmic scale]]s on both the horizontal and vertical axes. [[Monomial]]s – relationships of the form &lt;math&gt;y=ax^k&lt;/math&gt; – appear as straight lines in a log–log graph, with the power term corresponding to the slope, and the constant term corresponding to the intercept of the line. Thus these graphs are very useful for recognizing these relationships and [[estimating parameters]]. Any base can be used for the logarithm, though most common are 10, [[e (mathematical constant)|e]], and 2.

==Relation with monomials==
Given a monomial equation &lt;math&gt;y=ax^k,&lt;/math&gt; taking the logarithm of the equation (with any base) yields:
:&lt;math&gt;\log y = k \log x + \log a.&lt;/math&gt;
Setting &lt;math&gt;X = \log x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y = \log y,&lt;/math&gt; which corresponds to using a log–log graph, yields the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;Y = mX + b&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'' is the slope of the line ([[Grade (slope)|gradient]]) and ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''a'' is the intercept on the (log&amp;nbsp;''y'')-axis, meaning where log&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, so, reversing the logs, ''a'' is the ''y'' value corresponding to ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intmath.com/Exponential-logarithmic-functions/7_Graphs-log-semilog.php M. Bourne ''Graphs on Logarithmic and Semi-Logarithmic Paper'' (www.intmath.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equations ==

The equation for a line on a log–log scale would be:

:&lt;math&gt; \log_{10}F(x) = m \log_{10}x + b, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; F(x) = x^m\cdot10^b, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the slope and ''b'' is the intercept point on the log plot.

===Slope of a log–log plot===

[[Image:Slope of log-log plot.PNG|thumbnail|250px|Finding the slope of a log–log plot using ratios]]
To find the slope of the plot, two points are selected on the ''x''-axis, say ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Using the above equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \log[F (x_1)] = m \log (x_1) + b, \, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm {log}[F (x_2)] = m \log (x_2) + b. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The slope ''m'' is found taking the difference:

:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac { \mathrm {log} (F_2) - \mathrm {log} (F_1)} { \log(x_2) - \log(x_1) } = \frac {\log (F_2/F_1)}{\log(x_2/x_1)}, \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is shorthand for ''F'' ( ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ) and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is shorthand for ''F'' ( ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ). The figure at right illustrates the formula. Notice that the slope in the example of the figure is ''negative''. The formula also provides a negative slope, as can be seen from the following property of the logarithm:

:&lt;math&gt; \log(x_1/x_2) = -\log(x_2/x_1). \, &lt;/math&gt;

===Finding the function from the log–log plot===

The above procedure now is reversed to find the form of the function ''F''(''x'') using its (assumed) known log–log plot. To find the function ''F'',  pick some ''fixed point'' (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is shorthand for ''F''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), somewhere on the straight line in the above graph, and further some other ''arbitrary point'' (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) on the same graph.  Then from the slope formula above:

::&lt;math&gt; m = \frac {\log (F_1 / F_0)}{\log(x_1 / x_0)} &lt;/math&gt;

which leads to

::&lt;math&gt; \log(F_1 / F_0) = m \log(x_1 / x_0) = \log[(x_1 / x_0)^m ]. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that 10&lt;sup&gt;log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sup&gt; = ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, the logs can be inverted to find:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{F_1}{F_0} = \left(\frac{x_1}{x_0}\right)^m &lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;F_1 = \frac{F_0}{x_0^m} \,\, x^m, \, &lt;/math&gt;

which means that

: &lt;math&gt; F(x) = \mathrm{constant}\cdot x^m. &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, ''F'' is proportional to ''x'' to the power of the slope of the straight line of its log–log graph. Specifically, a straight line on a log–log plot containing points (''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) will have the function:
:&lt;math&gt; F(x) = {F_0}\left(\frac{x}{x_0}\right)^\frac {\log (F_1/F_0)}{\log(x_1/x_0)}, &lt;/math&gt;

Of course, the inverse is true too: any function of the form

:&lt;math&gt; F(x) = \mathrm{constant} \cdot x^m&lt;/math&gt;

will have a straight line as its log–log graph representation, where the slope of the line is&amp;nbsp;''m''.

===Finding the area under a straight-line segment of log–log plot===

To calculate the area under a continuous, straight-line segment of a log–log plot (or estimating an area of an almost-straight line), take the function defined previously

: &lt;math&gt; F(x) = \mathrm{constant}\cdot x^m. &lt;/math&gt;

and integrate it.  Since it is only operating on a definite integral (two defined endpoints), the area A under the plot takes the form

: &lt;math&gt; A(x) = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} F(x) dx = \frac{\mathrm{constant}}{m+1}\cdot x^{m+1}: [x_0,x_1] &lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging the original equation and plugging in the fixed point values, it is found that

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{constant} = \frac{F_0}{x_0^m} &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting back into the integral, you find that for A over x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; A = \frac{F_0/x_0^m}{m+1}\cdot (x_1^{m+1}-x_0^{m+1}) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \log A = \log \left[\frac{F_0 / x_0^m}{m+1}\cdot (x_1^{m+1}-x_0^{m+1})\right] = \log \frac{F_0}{m+1} - \log \frac{1}{x_0^m} + \log (x_1^{m+1}-x_0^{m+1}) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \log A = \log \frac{F_0}{m+1} + \log \left(\frac{x_1^{m+1}-x_0^{m+1}}{x_0^m}\right) = \log \frac{F_0}{m+1} + \log \left(\frac{x_1^m}{x_0^m}\cdot x_1 - \frac{x_0^{m+1}}{x_0^m}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore: &lt;math&gt; A = \frac{F_0}{m+1} \cdot \left[x_1 \cdot \left(\frac {x_1}{x_0}\right)^m - x_0\right] &lt;/math&gt;

For m=-1, the integral becomes &lt;math&gt; A_{(m=-1)} = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} F(x) = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} \frac {\mathrm{constant}}{x} = \frac{F_0}{x_0^{-1}} \int_{x_0}^{x_1} \frac {1}{x} = F_0 \cdot x_0 \cdot \ln x: [x_0,x_1] &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; A_{(m=-1)} = F_0 \cdot x_0 \cdot \ln \frac{x_1}{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==
These graphs are useful when the parameters ''a'' and ''b'' need to be estimated from numerical data. Specifications such as this are used frequently in [[economics]].

One example is the estimation of [[money demand]] functions based on [[Money demand#Inventory theory|inventory theory]], in which it can be assumed that money demand at time ''t'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;M_t = AR_t^bY_t^cU_t,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the real quantity of [[money]] held by the public, ''R'' is the [[rate of return]] on an alternative, higher yielding asset in excess of that on money, ''Y'' is the public's [[real income]], ''U'' is an error term assumed to be [[lognormal distribution|lognormally distributed]], ''A'' is a scale parameter to be estimated, and ''b'' and ''c'' are [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticity]] parameters to be estimated. Taking logs yields

:&lt;math&gt;m_t = a + br_t + cy_t + u_t,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' = log ''M'', ''a'' = log ''A'', ''r'' = log ''R'', ''y'' = log ''Y'', and ''u'' = log ''U'' with ''u'' being [[normal distribution|normally distributed]]. This equation can be estimated using [[ordinary least squares]].

Another economic example is the estimation of a firm's [[Cobb–Douglas production function]], which is the right side of the equation

:&lt;math&gt;Q_t=AN_t^{\alpha}K_t^{\beta}U_t,&lt;/math&gt;

in which ''Q'' is the quantity of output that can be produced per month, ''N'' is the number of hours of labor employed in production per month, ''K'' is the number of hours of physical capital utilized per month, ''U'' is an error term assumed to be lognormally distributed, and ''A'', &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are parameters to be estimated. Taking logs gives the linear regression equation

:&lt;math&gt;q_t = a + \alpha n_t + \beta k_t + u_t&lt;/math&gt;

where ''q'' = log ''Q'', ''a''=log ''A'', ''n''=log ''N'', ''k''=log ''K'', and ''u''=log ''U''.

Log–log regression can also be used to estimate the [[fractal dimension]] of a naturally occurring [[fractal]].

However, going in the other direction – observing that data appears as an approximate line on a log–log scale and concluding that the data follows a power law – is invalid.&lt;ref name=clauset&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Clauset, A. |author2=Shalizi, C. R. |author3=Newman, M. E. J. |year=2009| title=Power-Law Distributions in Empirical Data| journal=SIAM Review |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=661–703 |arxiv=0706.1062 |bibcode=2009SIAMR..51..661C| doi=10.1137/070710111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, many other functional forms appear approximately linear on the log–log scale, and simply evaluating the [[goodness of fit]] of a [[linear regression]] on logged data using the [[coefficient of determination]] (''R''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) may be invalid, as the assumptions of the linear regression model, such as Gaussian error, may not be satisfied; in addition, tests of fit of the log–log form may exhibit low [[statistical power]], as these tests may have low likelihood of rejecting power laws in the presence of other true functional forms. While simple log–log plots may be instructive in detecting possible power laws, and have been used dating back to [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] in the 1890s, validation as a power laws requires more sophisticated statistics.&lt;ref name=clauset/&gt;

These graphs are also extremely useful when data are gathered by varying the control variable along an exponential function, in which case the control variable ''x'' is more naturally represented on a log scale, so that the data points are evenly spaced, rather than compressed at the low end. The output variable ''y'' can either be represented linearly, yielding a [[lin–log graph]] (log&amp;nbsp;''x'', ''y''), or its logarithm can also be taken, yielding the log–log graph (log&amp;nbsp;''x'', log&amp;nbsp;''y'').

[[Bode plot]] (a [[plot (graphics)|graph]] of the [[frequency response]] of a system) is also log-log plot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4021">'''Mark(ing) your own homework''' (where "your" is often substituted with "their", "one's", "its", "his" or "her") is a British expression used in [[political discourse]], the study of [[organisational behaviour]] and in everyday life. The expression implies that whenever a person or group self-assesses and/or [[Industry self-regulation|self regulates]] their own work they will usually treat it more favorably than if it were assessed by an independent person or group.

A '''molecular assembler''', as defined by [[K. Eric Drexler]],  is a "proposed device able to guide [[chemical reaction]]s by positioning reactive molecules with atomic precision". A molecular assembler is a kind of [[molecular machine]].  Some biological molecules such as [[ribosome]]s fit this definition. This is because they receive instructions from [[mRNA|messenger RNA]] and then assemble specific sequences of [[amino acids]] to construct [[protein]] molecules.  However, the term "molecular assembler" usually refers to theoretical human-made devices.
[[Image:Protein translation.gif|thumb|300px| A [[ribosome]] is a [[biological machine]].]]
Beginning in 2007, the British [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] has funded development of ribosome-like molecular assemblers.  Clearly, molecular assemblers are possible in this limited sense. A technology roadmap project, led by the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]] and hosted by several [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|U.S. National Laboratories]] has explored a range of atomically precise fabrication technologies, including both early-generation and longer-term prospects for programmable molecular assembly; the report was released in December, 2007.&lt;ref name="RoadMap"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/roadmaps/Nanotech_Roadmap_2007_main.pdf|title=Productive Nanosystems: A Technology Roadmap|last=|first=|date=|website=Foresight Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council provided funding of 1.5 million pounds over six years for research working towards mechanized mechanosynthesis, in partnership with the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/G007837/1 |title=Grants on the Web |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104152935/http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP%2FG007837%2F1 |archivedate=November 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the term "molecular assembler" has been used in [[science fiction]] and [[popular culture]] to refer to a wide range of fantastic atom-manipulating nanomachines, many of which may be physically impossible in reality. Much of the controversy regarding "molecular assemblers" results from the confusion in the use of the name for both technical concepts and popular fantasies. In 1992, Drexler introduced the related but better-understood term "molecular manufacturing," which he defined as the programmed "chemical synthesis of complex structures by [[mechanosynthesis|mechanically positioning reactive molecules]], not by manipulating individual atoms."&lt;ref name="counterpoint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html|title=C&amp;En: Cover Story - Nanotechnology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article mostly discusses "molecular assemblers" in the popular sense. These include hypothetical machines that manipulate individual atoms and machines with organism-like [[Self-replicating machine|self-replicating]] abilities, mobility, ability to consume food, and so forth. These are quite different from devices that merely (as defined above) "guide chemical reactions by positioning reactive molecules with atomic precision".

Because synthetic molecular assemblers have never been constructed and because of the confusion regarding the meaning of the term, there has been much controversy as to whether "molecular assemblers" are possible or simply science fiction. Confusion and controversy also stem from their classification as [[nanotechnology]], which is an active area of laboratory research which has already been applied to the production of real products; however, there had been, until recently, no research efforts into the actual construction of "molecular assemblers".

Nonetheless, a 2013 paper by [[David Leigh (scientist)|David Leigh]]'s group, published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', details a new method of synthesizing a peptide in a sequence-specific manner by using an artificial molecular machine that is guided by a molecular strand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewandowski|first=Bartosz|last2=De Bo|first2=Guillaume|last3=Ward|first3=John W.|last4=Papmeyer|first4=Marcus|last5=Kuschel|first5=Sonja|last6=Aldegunde|first6=María J.|last7=Gramlich|first7=Philipp M.

The structure of the machine is based on a [[rotaxane]], which is a molecular ring sliding along a molecular axle. The ring carries a [[thiolate]] group which removes amino acids in sequence from the axle, transferring them to a peptide assembly site. In 2018, the same group published a more advanced version of this concept in which the molecular ring shuttles along a polymeric track to assemble an oligopeptide that can fold into a [[Alpha helix|α-helix]] that can perform the enantioselective epoxidation of a [[chalcone]] derivative (in a way reminiscent to the [[ribosome]] assembling an [[enzyme]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Bo|first=Guillaume|last2=Gall|first2=Malcolm A.

In 2017 [[David Leigh (scientist)|David Leigh]]'s group reported a molecular robot that could be programmed to construct any one of four different stereoisomers of a molecular product by using a nanomechanical robotic arm to move a molecular substrate between different reactive sites of an artificial molecular machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kassem | first1 = S. | last2 = Lee | first2 = A.

==Nanofactories==
A '''nanofactory''' is a proposed system in which [[nanotechnology|nanomachines]] (resembling molecular assemblers, or industrial robot arms) would combine reactive molecules via [[mechanosynthesis]] to build larger atomically precise parts. These, in turn, would be assembled by positioning mechanisms of assorted sizes to build macroscopic (visible) but still atomically-precise products.

A typical nanofactory would fit in a desktop box, in the vision of [[K. Eric Drexler]] published in ''Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing and Computation'' (1992), a notable work of "[[exploratory engineering]]". During the 1990s, others have extended the nanofactory concept, including an analysis of nanofactory convergent assembly by [[Ralph Merkle]], a systems design of a replicating nanofactory architecture by [[J. Storrs Hall]], [[Forrest Bishop|Forrest Bishop's]] "Universal Assembler", the patented exponential assembly process by [[Zyvex]], and a top-level systems design for a 'primitive nanofactory' by Chris Phoenix (Director of Research at the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology). All of these nanofactory designs (and more) are summarized in Chapter 4 of ''Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines'' (2004) by [[Robert Freitas]] and Ralph Merkle. The Nanofactory Collaboration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory|title=Nanofactory Collaboration|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by Freitas and Merkle in 2000, is a focused ongoing effort involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries that is developing a practical research agenda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/Challenges.htm|title=Nanofactory Technical Challenges|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically aimed at positionally-controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and diamondoid nanofactory development.

In 2005, a computer-animated short film of the nanofactory concept was produced by John Burch, in collaboration with Drexler. Such visions have been the subject of much debate, on several intellectual levels. No one has discovered an insurmountable problem with the underlying theories and no one has proved that the theories can be translated into practice. However, the debate continues, with some of it being summarized in the [[molecular nanotechnology]] article.

If nanofactories could be built, severe disruption to the [[world economy]] would be one of many possible negative impacts, though it could be argued that this disruption would have little negative effect if everyone had such nanofactories. Great benefits also would be anticipated. Various works of [[science fiction]] have explored these and similar concepts. The potential for such devices was part of the mandate of a major UK study led by [[mechanical engineering]] professor Dame [[Ann Dowling]].

==Self-replication==
"Molecular assemblers" have been confused with self-replicating machines. To produce a practical quantity of a desired product,  the nanoscale size of a typical science fiction universal molecular assembler requires an extremely large number of such devices. However, a single such theoretical molecular assembler might be programmed to [[self replication|self-replicate]], constructing many copies of itself.  This would allow an exponential rate of production. Then after sufficient quantities of the molecular assemblers were available, they would then be re-programmed for production of the desired product. However, if self-replication of molecular assemblers were not restrained then it might lead to competition with naturally occurring organisms. This has been called [[ecophagy]] or the [[grey goo]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crnano.org/BD-Goo.htm|title=Nanotechnology: Grey Goo is a Small Issue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One method to building molecular assemblers is to mimic evolutionary processes employed by biological systems. Biological evolution proceeds by random variation combined with culling of the less-successful variants and reproduction of the more-successful variants. Production of complex molecular assemblers might be evolved from simpler systems since "A [[complex system]] that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. . . . A complex system designed from scratch never works and can not be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a system that works."&lt;ref name="JohGall"&gt;
Gall, John, (1986) Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail, 2nd ed. Ann Arbor, MI : The General Systemantics Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most published safety guidelines include
"recommendations against developing ... replicator designs which permit surviving mutation or undergoing evolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/current.html|title=Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most assembler designs keep the "source code" external to the physical assembler. At each step of a manufacturing process, that step is read from an ordinary computer file and "broadcast" to all the assemblers.
If any assembler gets out of range of that computer, or when the link between that computer and the assemblers is broken, or when that computer is unplugged, the assemblers stop replicating.
Such a "broadcast architecture" is one of the safety features recommended by the "Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology", and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator design space&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.9.htm|title=Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous practical methods by which replicators can be safely controlled by good design.

==Drexler and Smalley debate==
{{main|Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology}}

One of the most outspoken critics of some concepts of "molecular assemblers" was Professor [[Richard Smalley]] (1943–2005) who won the [[Nobel prize]] for his contributions to the field of [[nanotechnology]]. Smalley believed that such assemblers were not physically possible and introduced scientific objections to them. His two principal technical objections were termed the "fat fingers problem" and the "sticky fingers problem".  He believed these would exclude the possibility of "molecular assemblers" that worked by precision picking and placing of individual atoms. Drexler and coworkers responded to these two issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/SciAmDebate2/smalley.html|title=Institute for Molecular ManufacturingDebate About Assemblers — Smalley Rebuttal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a 2001 publication.

Smalley also believed that Drexler's speculations about apocalyptic dangers of self-replicating machines that have been equated with "molecular assemblers" would threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology. To address the debate between Drexler and Smalley regarding molecular assemblers ''[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]'' published a point-counterpoint consisting of an exchange of letters that addressed the issues.&lt;ref name="counterpoint"/&gt;

==Regulation==
Speculation on the power of systems that have been called "molecular assemblers" has sparked a wider political discussion on the implication of nanotechnology. This is in part due to the fact that nanotechnology is a very broad term and could include "molecular assemblers." Discussion of the possible implications of fantastic molecular assemblers has prompted calls for regulation of current and future nanotechnology. There are very real concerns with the potential health and ecological impact of nanotechnology that is being integrated in manufactured products. [[Greenpeace]] for instance commissioned a report concerning nanotechnology in which they express concern into the toxicity of nanomaterials that have been introduced in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/MultimediaFiles/Live/FullReport/5886.pdf Future Technologies, Today’s Choices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414081108/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/MultimediaFiles/Live/FullReport/5886.pdf |date=2006-04-14 }} Nanotechnology, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics; A technical, political and institutional map of emerging technologies. A report for the Greenpeace Environmental Trust&lt;/ref&gt; However, it makes only passing references to "assembler" technology. The UK [[Royal Society]] and [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] also commissioned a report entitled "Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm|title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies:opportunities and uncertainties|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding the larger social and ecological implications on nanotechnology. This report does not discuss the threat posed by potential so-called "molecular assemblers."

==Formal scientific review==
In 2006, U.S. National Academy of Sciences released the report of a study of molecular manufacturing as part of a longer report, ''A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11752.html|title=A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative - The National Academies Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study committee reviewed the technical content of ''Nanosystems'', and in its conclusion states that no current theoretical analysis can be considered definitive regarding several questions of potential system performance, and that optimal paths for implementing high-performance systems cannot be predicted with confidence. It recommends experimental research to advance knowledge in this area:

:"Although theoretical calculations can be made today, the eventually attainable range of chemical reaction cycles, error rates, speed of operation, and [[Thermodynamic efficiency|thermodynamic efficiencies]] of such bottom-up manufacturing systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Thus, the eventually attainable perfection and complexity of manufactured products, while they can be calculated in theory, cannot be predicted with confidence. Finally, the optimum research paths that might lead to systems which greatly [[Thermodynamic efficiency limit|exceed the thermodynamic efficiencies]] and other capabilities of biological systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Research funding that is based on the ability of investigators to produce experimental demonstrations that link to abstract models and guide long-term vision is most appropriate to achieve this goal."

==Grey goo==
{{Main|Grey goo}}

One potential scenario that has been envisioned is out-of-control self-replicating molecular assemblers in the form of [[grey goo]] which consumes carbon to continue its replication. If unchecked such mechanical replication could potentially consume whole [[ecoregion]]s or the whole Earth ([[ecophagy]]), or it could simply outcompete natural lifeforms for necessary resources such as [[carbon]], [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], or [[UV]] light (which some [[nanomotor]] examples run on). However, the [[ecophagy]] and 'grey goo' scenarios, like synthetic molecular assemblers, are based upon still-hypothetical technologies that have not yet been demonstrated experimentally.

==In fiction==
{{Main|Nanotechnology in fiction}}

Molecular assemblers are a popular topic in science fiction, for example, the matter compiler in [[Diamond Age|The Diamond Age]] and the cornucopia machine in [[Singularity Sky]]. The [[replicator (Star Trek)|replicator]] in ''[[Star Trek]]'' might also be considered a molecular assembler. A molecular assembler is also a key element of the plot of the computer game ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' (called a "universal constructor" in the game).

In the political sci-fi comic series [[Transmetropolitan]], written by [[Warren Ellis]], machines called "Makers" are used to replicate and reform matter. Each morning, Makers sweep the streets for garbage, gathering the matter to recycle it into more useful objects. The main character also uses a Maker in his apartment to instantly produce a pair of glasses which take photos, as well as other objects such as clothing.

In Dead Money, a DLC of the video game [[Fallout: New Vegas]], the player can obtain useful items from vending machines that use an unknown form of molecular assembly technology to transform casino chips that the player can find into any of several items.

In the cyberpunk visual novel [[Baldr Sky]], a nano machine simply given the name "Assembler" is present for the purpose of cleaning the polluted atmosphere.

'''Neurocognitive''' functions are [[cognitive function]]s closely linked to the function of particular areas, [[neural pathway]]s, or [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] networks in the [[brain]] substrate layers of neurological matrix at the cellular molecular level. Therefore, their understanding is closely linked to the practice of [[neuropsychology]] and [[cognitive neuroscience]], two disciplines that broadly seek to understand how the structure and function of the brain relate to cognition and behaviour.

A '''neurocognitive deficit''' is a reduction or impairment of cognitive function in one of these areas, but particularly when physical changes can be seen to have occurred in the brain, such as after [[neurological illness]], [[mental illness]], [[medication|drug]] use, or [[Acquired brain injury|brain injury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blazer|first1=Dan|title=Commentary: Neurocognitive Disorders in DSM-5|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=170|issue=6|pages=585–587|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13020179|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13020179|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clinical neuropsychologist may specialise in using [[neuropsychological test]]s to detect and understand such deficits, and may be involved in the [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] of an affected person. The discipline that studies neurocognitive deficits to infer normal psychological function is called [[cognitive neuropsychology]].

'''Online hate speech''' is a type of speech that takes place online (e.g. the [[Internet]], [[Social media|social media platforms]]) with the purpose to attack a person or a group on the basis of attributes such as [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[religion]], [[ethnic origin]], [[sexual orientation]], [[disability]], or [[gender]].

Hate speech online is situated at the intersection of multiple tensions: it is the expression of conflicts between different groups within and across societies; it is a vivid example of how technologies with a transformative potential such as the Internet bring with them both opportunities and challenges; and it implies complex balancing between fundamental rights and principles, including [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and the defense of [[Dignity|human dignity]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Countering Online Hate Speech|last=Gagliardone|first=Iginio|last2=Gal|first2=Danit|last3=Alves|first3=Thiago|last4=Martinez|first4=Gabriela|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002332/233231e.pdf|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hate speech is a broad and contested term. [[Multilateral treaty|Multilateral treaties]] such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) have sought to define its contours. [[Multi-stakeholder governance|Multi-stakeholders processes]] (e.g. the Rabat Plan of Action) have been initiated to bring greater clarity and suggest mechanisms to identify hateful messages. And yet, hate speech continues largely to be used in everyday discourse as a generic term, mixing concrete threats to individuals' and groups' security with cases in which people may be simply venting their anger against authority. Internet intermediaries—organizations that mediate online communication such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Google]]—have advanced their own definitions of hate speech that bind users to a set of rules and allow companies to limit certain forms of expression. National and regional bodies have sought to promote understandings of the term that are more rooted in local traditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Internet]]'s speed and reach makes it difficult for governments to enforce national legislation in the [[virtual world]]. Issues around hate speech online bring into clear relief the emergence of private spaces for expression that serve a public function (e.g. Facebook, Twitter), and the challenges that these spaces pose for regulators. Some of the companies owning these spaces have become more responsive towards tackling the problem of hate speech online.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The character of hate speech online and its relation to offline speech and action are widely talked about—by [[Politician|politicians]], [[Activism|activists]] and academics—but the debates tend to be removed from systematic empirical evidence. The character of perceived hate speech and its possible consequences has led to placing much emphasis on the solutions to the problem and on how they should be grounded in international human rights norms. Yet this very focus has also limited deeper attempts to understand the causes underlying the phenomenon and the dynamics through which certain types of content emerge, diffuse and lead—or not—to actual [[discrimination]], [[hostility]] or [[violence]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Definitions ==

=== Hate speech ===
Hate speech lies in a complex nexus with [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], individual, group and [[minority rights]], as well as concepts of dignity, liberty and equality. Its definition is often contested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In national and international legislation, hate speech refers to expressions that advocate incitement to harm (particularly, discrimination, hostility or [[Online youth radicalization|violence]]) based upon the target's being identified with a certain social or demographic group. It may include, but is not limited to, speech that advocates, threatens, or encourages violent acts. The concept may extend also to expressions that foster a climate of prejudice and intolerance on the assumption that this may fuel targeted [[discrimination]], hostility and violent attacks. At critical times, such as during elections, the concept of hate speech may be prone to [[wikt:manipulation|manipulation]]: accusations of fomenting hate speech may be traded among political opponents or used by those in power to curb [[dissent]] and [[criticism]]. Hate speech (be it conveyed through text, images or sound) can be identified by approximation through the degrading or [[Dehumanization|dehumanizing]] functions that it serves. There may be two types of messages. The first is to the targeted group and functions to dehumanize and diminish members assigned to this group. It often sounds more or less like:

"Don't be fooled into thinking you are welcome here. [...] You are not wanted, and you and your families will be shunned, excluded, beaten, and driven out, whenever we can get away with it. We may have to keep a low profile right now. But don't get too comfortable. [...] Be afraid."&lt;ref&gt;Waldron 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another function of hate speech is to let others with similar views know they are not alone, to reinforce a sense of an in-group that is (purportedly) under threat. A typical message sent this time to like-minded individuals can read like:

"We know some of you agree that these people are not wanted here. We know that some of you feel that they are dirty (or dangerous or criminal or [[Terrorism|terrorist]]). Know now that you are not alone. [...] There are enough of us around to make sure these people are not welcome. There are enough of us around to draw attention to what these people are really like".&lt;ref&gt;Waldron 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hate speech relies on tensions, which it seeks to re-produce and amplify. Such speech unites and divides at the same time. It creates "us" and "them".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Characteristics ===
The proliferation of hate speech online, observed by the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues (HRC, 2015), poses a new set of challenges. Both [[Social networking service|social networking platforms]] and organizations created to combat hate speech have recognized that hateful messages [[Dissemination|disseminated]] online are increasingly common and have elicited unprecedented attention to develop adequate responses.&lt;ref&gt;See Council of Europe, "Mapping study on projects against hate speech online", 15 April 2012. See also interviews: Christine Chen, Senior Manager for Public Policy, Google, 2 March 2015; Monika Bickert, Head of Global Policy Management, Facebook, 14 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hatebase|HateBase]], a web-based application that collects instances of hate speech online worldwide, the majority of cases of hate speech target individuals based on [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] and [[nationality]], but incitements to hatred focusing on [[religion]] and class have also been on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;See HateBase, Hate speech statistics, http://www.hatebase.org/popular&lt;/ref&gt;

While hate speech online is not intrinsically different from similar expressions found offline, there are peculiar challenges unique to online content and its regulation. Those challenges related to its permanence, itinerancy, [[Human rights and encryption|anonymity]] and cross-jurisdictional character are among the most complex to address.

Hate speech can stay online for a long time in different formats across multiple platforms, which can be linked repeatedly. As Andre Oboler, the CEO of the Online Hate Prevention Institute, has noted, "The longer the content stays available, the more damage it can inflict on the victims and empower the perpetrators. If you remove the content at an early stage you can limit the exposure. This is just like cleaning litter, it doesn't stop people from littering but if you do not take care of the problem it just piles up and further exacerbates."&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Andre Oboler, CEO, Online Hate Prevention Institute, 31 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twitter]]'s conversations organized around trending topics may facilitate the quick and wide spreading of hateful messages, but they also offer the opportunity for influential speakers to shun messages and possibly end popular threads [[Online youth radicalization|inciting violence]]. [[Facebook]], on the contrary, may allow multiple threads to continue in parallel and go unnoticed; creating longer lasting spaces where certain individuals and groups are offended, ridiculed and discriminated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hate speech online can be itinerant. Even when content is removed, it may find expression elsewhere, possibly on the same platform under a different name or on different online spaces. If a [[website]] is shut down, it can quickly reopen using a [[Web hosting service|web-hosting service]] with less stringent [[Regulation|regulations]] or via the reallocation to a country with laws imposing higher threshold for hate speech. The itinerant nature of hate speech also means that poorly formulated thoughts that would have not found public expression and support in the past may now land on spaces where they can be visible to large audiences.&lt;ref&gt;There are cases of individuals who had to serve jail sentences for tweets written when drunk or for having jokingly tweeted they were planning to blowing up an airport (Rowbottom 2012).{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anonymity]] can also present a challenge to dealing with hate speech online. "(T)he internet facilitates anonymous and pseudonymous discourse, which can just as easily accelerate destructive behavior as it can fuel public discourse"&lt;ref&gt;Citron &amp; Norton 2011{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As Drew Boyd, Director of Operations at The [[Sentinel Project for Genocide Prevention|Sentinel Project]], has stated, "the Internet grants individuals the ability to say horrific things because they think they will not be discovered. This is what makes online hate speech so unique, because people feel much more comfortable speaking hate as opposed to real life when they have to deal with the consequences of what they say".&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Drew Boyd, Director of Operations, The Sentinel Project for Genocide Prevention, 24 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some governments and [[social media]] platforms have sought to enforce real name [[Policy|policies]]. Such measures have been deeply contested as they hit at the [[right to privacy]] and its intersection with free expression. The majority of [[Internet troll|online trolling]] and hate speech attacks come from [[Pseudonym|pseudonymous]] accounts, which are not necessarily anonymous to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Ian Brown, University of Oxford, 26 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Genuinely anonymous online communications are rare, as they require the user to employ highly technical measures to ensure that he or she cannot be easily identifiable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A further complication is the [[Transnationalism|transnational]] reach of the Internet, raising issues of cross jurisdictional co-operation in regard to legal mechanisms for combating hate speech. While there are [[Mutual legal assistance treaty|Mutual Legal Assistance treaties]] in place amongst many countries, these are characteristically slow to work. The transnational reach of many [[Private sector|private-sector]] [[Multi-stakeholder governance|Internet intermediaries]] may provide a more effective channel for resolving issues in some cases, although these bodies are also often impacted upon by cross-jurisdictional appeals for data (such as revealing the identity of the author of a particular content).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike the dissemination of hate speech through conventional channels, hate speech dissemination online often involves multiple actors, whether knowingly or not. When perpetrators makes use of an online social platform to disseminate their hateful message they do not only hurt their victims, but may also violate terms of service in that platform and at times even state law, depending on their location. The victims, on their part, may feel helpless in the face of online harassment, not knowing to whom they should turn to for help. In the types of responses mapped throughout the study, it appears that collective action, usually undertaken by [[Non-governmental organization|nongovernmental organizations]] and [[Advocacy group|lobby groups]], has been an effective [[modus operandi]] to raise awareness and encourage different stakeholders to take action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Stormfront'' precedent ===
In the aftermath of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|2014]]'s [[Islamic terrorism|dramatic incidents]], calls for more restrictive or intrusive measures to contain the Internet's potential to spread hate and violence are common, as if the links between [[Online youth radicalization|online and offline violence]] were well known. On the contrary, as the following example indicates, appearances may often be deceiving. [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] is considered the first "hate website"&lt;ref&gt;Meddaugh and Kay, 2009{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Launched in March 1995 by a former [[Ku Klux Klan|Ku Klux Klan leader]], it quickly became a popular space for discussing ideas related to [[Neo-Nazism]], [[White nationalism]] and [[White separatism]], first in the [[United States|United States of America]] and then globally&lt;ref&gt;Bowman-Grieve, 2009{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The forum hosts calls for a racial holy war and incitement to use violence to resist [[immigration]]&lt;ref&gt;Bowman-Grieve, 2009{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered a space for recruiting [[Activism|activists]] and possibly coordinating violent acts&lt;ref&gt;Chang et al. 2014{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; . The few studies that have explored who the users of Stormfront actually are depict a more complex picture. Rather than seeing it as a space for coordinating actions, well-known extreme right activists have accused the forum to be just a gathering for "[[Keyboard man|keyboard warriors]]". One of them for example, as reported by De Koster and Houtman, stated, "I have read quite a few pieces around the forum, and it strikes me that a great fuss is made, whereas little happens. The section activism/politics itself is plainly ridiculous. [...] Not to mention the assemblies where just four people turn up"&lt;ref&gt;De Koster and Houtman, 2008{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Even more revealing are some of the responses to these accusations provided by regular members of the website. As one of them argued, "Surely, I am entitled to have an opinion without actively carrying it out. [...] I do not attend demonstrations and I neither join a political party. If this makes me a keyboard warrior, that is all right. I feel good this way. [...] I am not ashamed of it"&lt;ref&gt;De Koster and Houtman, 2008{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. De Koster and Houtman surveyed only one national chapter of Stormfront and a non-representative sample of users, but answers like those above should at least invite to caution towards hypotheses connecting expressions and actions, even in spaces whose main function is to host extremist views.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Frameworks ==

=== International principles ===
Hate speech is not explicitly mentioned in many [[International human rights law|international human rights]] documents and [[Treaty|treaties]], but it is indirectly called upon by some of the principles related to human dignity and [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]]. For example, the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR), which was drafted as a response to the atrocities of the [[World War II]], contains the right to equal protection under the law in Article 7, which proclaims that: "All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;UDHR, Art 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The UDHR also states that everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes "freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers".&lt;ref&gt;UDHR, Art 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The UDHR was decisive in setting a framework and agenda for human rights protection, but the Declaration is [[Non-binding resolution|non-binding]]. A series of binding documents have been subsequently created to offer a more robust protection for freedom of expression and protection against discrimination. Out of those documents, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) is the most important and comprehensive when addressing hate speech and contains the right to freedom of expression in Article 19 and the prohibition of advocacy to hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence in Article 20. Other more tailored international legal instruments contain provisions that have repercussions for the definition of hate speech and identification of responses to it, such as: the [[Genocide Convention|Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] (1951), the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], ICERD (1969), and, to a lesser extent, the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]], CEDAW (1981).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Hate speech and the ICCPR ===
The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]] is the legal instrument most commonly referred to in debates on hate speech and its regulation, although it does not explicitly use the term "hate speech". Article 19, which is often referred to as part of the "core of the Covenant"&lt;ref&gt;Nowak 1993{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, provides for the right to freedom of expression. This sets out the right, and it also includes general strictures to which any limitation of the right must conform in order to be legitimate. Article 19 is followed by Article 20 that expressly limits freedom of expression in cases of "advocacy of national, [[Race (human categorization)|racial]] or [[Religious intolerance|religious hatred]] that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence"&lt;ref&gt;Leo et al. 2011{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The decision to include this provision, which can be characterised as embodying a particular conceptualisation of hate speech, has been deeply contested. The [[United Nations Human Rights Committee|Human Rights Committee]], the [[United Nations]] body created by the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|ICCPR]] to oversee its implementation, cognizant of the tension, has sought to stress that Article 20 is fully compatible with the right to freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Committee. General Comment no. 11, Article 20: Prohibition of Propaganda for War and Inciting National, Racial or Religious Hatred, 29 July 1983, para. 2. In 2011, The Committee elucidated its views on the relationship of Article 19 and 20 when it reaffirmed that the provisions complement each other and that Article 20 "may be considered as lex specialis with regard to Article 19". Human Rights Committee. General Comment no. 34, Article 19: Freedoms of opinion and expression, CCPR/C/GC/34, 12 September 2011, paras. 48-52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ICCPR, the right to freedom of expression is not an absolute right. It can legitimately be limited by states under restricted circumstances:

"3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary: (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; (b) For the protection of national security or of public order ([[Public policy doctrine|ordre public]]), or of [[public health]] or [[Morality|morals]]."&lt;ref&gt;Article 19 (3) if the ICCPR.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between Article 19 (3) and Article 20, there is a distinction between optional and obligatory limitations to the right to freedom of expression. Article 19 (3) states that limitations on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] "may therefore be subject to certain restrictions", as long as they are provided by law and necessary to certain legitimate purposes. Article 20 states that any advocacy of (certain kinds of) hatred that constitutes incitement to [[discrimination]], [[hostility]] or violence "shall be prohibited by law". Despite indications on the gravity of speech offenses that should be prohibited by law under Article 20, there remains complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Even the Human Rights Committee, which has decided on cases concerning Article 20, has avoided providing a definition of incitement to hatred. Human Rights Council. Incitement to Racial and Religious Hatred and the Promotion of Tolerance: Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, A/HRC/2/6, 20 September 2006, para. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular there is a grey area in conceptualising clear distinctions between (i) expressions of hatred, (ii) expression that advocate hatred, and (iii) hateful speech that specifically constitutes incitement to the practical harms of discrimination, hostility or violence. While states have an obligation to prohibit speech conceived as "advocacy to hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence", as consistent with Article 20 (2),&lt;ref&gt;Faurisson v. France , C. Individual opinion by Elizabeth Evatt and David Kretzmer, co-signed by Eckart Klein (concurring), para. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; how to interpret such is not clearly defined.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Council. Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Addendum, Expert seminar on the links between articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, A/HRC/10/31/Add.3, 16 January 2009, para. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other international legal instruments ===

==== ICERD ====
The [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (ICERD), which came into force in 1969, has also implications for conceptualising forms of hate speech. The ICERD differs from the ICCPR in three respects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Its conceptualisation of hate speech is specifically limited to speech that refers to race and [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]]. It asserts in Article 4, paragraph (a), that state parties:

"Shall declare as an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another color or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof; This obligation imposed by the ICERD on state parties is also stricter than the case of Article 20 of the ICCPR covering the criminalisation of racist ideas that are not necessarily inciting discrimination, hostility or violence."

An important difference is in the issue of [[Intention|intent]]. The concept of "advocacy of hatred" introduced in the ICCPR is more specific than discriminatory speech described in the ICERD, since it is taken to require consideration of the intent of author and not the expression in [[Isolationism|isolation]]—this is because "advocacy" is interpreted in the ICCPR as requiring the intent to sow hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, A/HRC/2/6, para. 39;&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has actively addressed hate speech in its General Recommendation 29, in which the Committee recommends state parties to:

"(r) Take measures against any dissemination of ideas of caste superiority and inferiority or which attempt to justify violence, hatred or discrimination against descent-based communities; (s) Take strict measures against any incitement to discrimination or violence against the communities, including through the Internet; (t) Take measures to raise awareness among media professionals of the nature and incidence of descent-based discrimination;"&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, General Recommendation 29, Discrimination Based on Descent (Sixty-first session, 2002), U.N. Doc. A/57/18 at 111 (2002), reprinted in Compilation of General Comments and General Recommendations Adopted by Human Rights Treaty Bodies, U.N.Doc. HRI\GEN\1\Rev.6 at 223 (2003), paras. r, s and t&lt;/ref&gt;

These points, which reflect the ICERD's reference to the dissemination of expression, have significance for the [[Internet]]. The expression of ideas in some online contexts may immediately amount to spreading them. This is especially relevant for private spaces that have begun to play a public role, as in the case of many [[Social networking service|social networking platforms]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Genocide Convention ====
Similarly to the ICERD, the [[Genocide Convention]] aims to protect groups defined by race, nationality or ethnicity, although it also extends its provisions to religious groups. When it comes to hate speech the Genocide Convention is limited only to acts that publicly incite to [[genocide]], recognized as "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group", regardless of whether such acts are undertaken in peacetime or in wartime&lt;ref&gt;Defeis 1992{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Specifically [[Gender violence|gender-based]] hate speech (as distinct from discriminatory actions) is not covered in depth in [[international law]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== CEDAW ====
The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), which entered into force in 1981, imposes obligations on states to condemn discrimination against women&lt;ref&gt;Article 2 of the CEDAW.&lt;/ref&gt; and "prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish" acts of gender-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;General recommendation No. 28 on the core obligations of States parties under article 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women Para. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regional responses ===
Most [[Regional organization|regional instruments]] do not have specific articles prescribing [[prohibition]] of hate speech, but they more generally allow states to limit freedom of expression—which provisions can be applied to specific cases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== American Convention on Human Rights ====
The [[American Convention on Human Rights]] describes limitations on freedom of expression in a manner similar to the ICCPR in Article 19 (3). The [[Organization of American States]] has also adopted another declaration on the principles of freedom of expression, which includes a specific clause stating that "prior conditioning of expressions, such as truthfulness, timeliness or [[impartiality]] is incompatible with the right to freedom of expression recognized in international instruments".&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Inter-American Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression, 20 October 2000, para. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Inter-American Court has advised that "(a)buse of freedom of information thus cannot be controlled by [[Risk|preventive measures]] but only through the subsequent imposition of sanctions on those who are guilty of the abuses".&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion OC-5/85, 13 November 1985, para. 39&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also imposes a test for States willing to enact restrictions on freedom of expression, as they need to observe the following requirements: "a) the existence of previously established grounds for liability; b) the express and precise definition of these grounds by law; c) the legitimacy of the ends sought to be achieved; d) a showing that these grounds of liability are ‘necessary to ensure' the aforementioned ends."&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion OC-5/85, 13 November 1985, para 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Inter-American System has a [[Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression|Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression]] who conducted a comprehensive study on hate speech. His conclusion was that the Inter-American Human Rights System differs from the United Nations and the [[European Union|European]] approach on a key point: The Inter-American system covers only hate speech that actually leads to violence, and solely such speech can be restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Advisory Opinion OC-5/85, 13 November 1985, para 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== African Charter on Human Rights and Peoples' Rights ====
The [[African Union|African]] Charter on Human Rights and Peoples' Rights takes a different approach in Article 9 (2), allowing for restrictions on rights as long as they are "within the law". This concept has been criticized and there is a vast amount of legal scholarship on the so-called "claw-back" clauses and their interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Viljoen 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The criticism is mainly aimed at the fact that countries can manipulate their own legislation and weaken the essence of the right to freedom of expression. The Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa elaborates a higher standard for limitations on freedom of expression. It declares that the right "should not be restricted on public order or national security grounds unless there is a real risk of harm to a legitimate interest and there is a close causal link between the risk of harm and the expression".&lt;ref&gt;African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights. Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa, 32nd Session, Banjul, 17 - 23 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam ====
In 1990, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organization of the Islamic Conference]] (which was later renamed Organization of Islamic Cooperation, OIC) adopted the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] (CDHRI), which calls for criminalisation of speech that extends beyond cases of imminent violence to encompass "acts or speech that denote manifest intolerance and hate".&lt;ref&gt;Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Sixth OIC Observatory Report on Islamophobia, Presented to the 40th Council of Foreign Ministers, Conakry, Republic of Guinea, December 2013, p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Arab Charter on Human Rights ====
The Arab Charter on Human Rights, which was adopted by the [[Council of the Arab League|Council]] of the [[Arab League|League of Arab States]] in 2004, includes in Article 32 provisions that are relevant also for online communication as it guarantees the right to "freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any medium, regardless of geographical boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;League of Arab States, Arab Charter on Human Rights, 22 May, 2004, entered into force 15 March 2008, para. 32 (1)&lt;/ref&gt; It allows a limitation on a broad basis in paragraph 2 "Such rights and freedoms shall be exercised in conformity with the fundamental values of society".&lt;ref&gt;League of Arab States, Arab Charter on Human Rights, 22 May, 2004, entered into force 15 March 2008, para. 32 (2).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ASEAN Human Rights Declaration ====
The [[ASEAN Human Rights Declaration]] includes the right to freedom of expression in Article 23. Article 7 of the Declaration provides for general limitations, affirming, "the realisation of human rights must be considered in the regional and national context bearing in mind different political, economic, legal, social, cultural, historical and religious backgrounds."&lt;ref&gt;Article 7 of the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ====
The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] which declares the right to freedom of expression in Article 11, has a clause which prohibits abuse of rights. It asserts that the Charter must not be interpreted as implying any "limitation to a greater extent than is provided for therein".&lt;ref&gt;Article 54 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a limitation which implies a strict test of necessity and proportionality is the provision on freedom of expression in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which underlines that the exercise of freedom of expression carries duties and responsibilities. It "may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a [[Democracy|democratic]] society, in the interests of [[national security]], [[territorial integrity]] or [[Public security|public safety]], for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary".&lt;ref&gt;Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] is careful to distinguish between hate speech and the right of individuals to express their views freely, even if others take offence.&lt;ref&gt;Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, para. 49. More cases of hate Speech under the European Court can be found at: http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/FS_Hate_speech_ENG.pdf 49&lt;/ref&gt; There are regional instances relevant specifically to online hate speech. The [[Council of Europe]] (CoE) in 2000 issued a General Policy Recommendation on Combating the Dissemination of Racist, [[Xenophobia|Xenophobic]] and [[Antisemitism|Anti-Semitic]] Material via the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;ECRI General Policy Recommendation No. 6, On Combating the Dissemination of Racist, Xenophobic and Antisemitic Material via the Internet, adopted on 15 December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the CoE Convention on Cybercrime in 2001, which regulates mutual assistance regarding investigative powers, provides signatory countries with a mechanism to deal with [[Data (computing)|computer data]], which would include [[Transnationalism|transnational]] hate speech online.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, Convention on Cybercrime, 23 November 2001, paras 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 the CoE launched an additional protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime which addresses online expression of racism and xenophobia. The convention and its protocol were opened for signature and ratification of countries outside [[Europe]], and other countries, such as [[Canada]] and [[South Africa]], are already part of this convention. The Protocol imposes an obligation on Member States to criminalise racist and xenophobic insults online of "(i) persons for the reason that they belong to a group distinguished by race, color, descent or national or ethnic origin, as well as religion, if used as a pretext for any of these factors; or (ii) a group of persons which is distinguished by any of these characteristics".&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe, Additional Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime, concerning the criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems, 28 January 2003, art 5 para 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private spaces ===
[[Internet]] intermediaries such as [[Social networking service|social networking platforms]], [[Internet service provider|Internet Service Providers]] or [[Web search engine|Search Engines]], stipulate in their [[terms of service]] how they may intervene in allowing, restricting, or channelling the creation and access to specific content. A vast amount of online interactions occur on social networking platforms that transcend national jurisdictions and which platforms have also developed their own definitions of hate speech and measures to respond to it. For a user who violates the terms of service, the content he or she has posted may be removed from the platform, or its access may be restricted to be viewed only by a certain category of users (e.g. users living outside a specific country).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The principles that inspire terms of service agreements and the mechanisms that each company develops to ensure their [[implementation]] have significant repercussions on the ability that people have to express themselves online as well as to be protected from hate speech. Most intermediaries have to enter in negotiations with national governments to an extent that varies according to the type of intermediary, areas where the company is registered, and the legal regime that applies. As Tsesis explains, "(i)f transmissions on the Internet are sent and received in particular locations, then specific fora retain jurisdiction to prosecute illegal activities transacted on the Internet"&lt;ref&gt;Tsesis, 2001{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Internet Service Providers are the most directly affected by national legislation because they have to be located in a specific country to operate. Search Engines, while they can modify search results for self-regulatory or commercial reasons, have increasingly tended to adapt to the intermediary liability regime of both their registered home jurisdictions and other jurisdictions in which they provide their services, either removing links to content proactively or upon request by authorities&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon et al. 2015{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

All Internet intermediaries operated by [[Privately held company|private companies]] are also expected to respect [[human rights]]. This is set out in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights elaborated by the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]]. The document emphasizes [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate responsibility]] in upholding human rights. In principle 11, it declares that: "Business enterprises should respect human rights. This means that they should avoid infringing on the human rights of others and should address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf, principle 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Guiding Principles also indicate that in cases in which human rights are violated, companies should "provide for or cooperate in their remediation through legitimate processes".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf, principle 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Internet intermediaries and conceptions of hate speech, this means that they should ensure that measures are in place to provide a commensurate response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Social responses ==

=== Civil society ===
[[Myanmar]] is transitioning towards greater openness and access to the Internet has grown at unprecedented rates. In this context, however, social media have often been used by some to spread calls to violence.&lt;ref&gt;Hereward Holland, "Facebook in Myanmar: Amplifying Hate Speech?," Al Jazeera, 14 June 2014, http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/06/facebook-myanmar-rohingya-amplifying-hatespeech-2014612112834290144.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UN Human Rights Council]] Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues expressed her concern over the spread of [[misinformation]], hate speech and [[Hate speech|incitement to violence]], discrimination and hostility in the media and Internet, particularly targeted against a minority community&lt;ref&gt;HRC, 2015{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The growing tension online has gone parallel with cases of actual violence leaving hundreds dead and thousands displaced.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Is There Communal Violence in Myanmar?", BBC, 3 July 2014. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/worldasia-18395788&lt;/ref&gt; One challenge in this process has concerned ethnic and religious minorities. In 2013, 43 people were killed due to clashes that erupted after a dispute in the [[Rakhine State|Rakhine state]] in the Western Part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Is There Communal Violence in Myanmar?", BBC, 3 July 2014. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/worldasia-18395788&lt;/ref&gt; A year earlier, more than 200 people were killed and thousands displaced 37 because of ethnic violence, which erupted after an alleged rape case.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Marshall, "Special Report: Plight of Muslim Minority Threatens Myanmar Spring," Reuters, 15 June 2012, https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/15/us-myanmar-rohingya-idUSBRE85E06A20120615&lt;/ref&gt; Against this backdrop, the rapid emergence of new online spaces, albeit for a fraction of the population, has reflected some of these deeply rooted tensions in a new form. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dealing with intolerance and hate speech online is an emerging issue. Facebook has rapidly become the platform of choice for those citizens making their first steps online. In this environment there have been individual and groups, which have championed a more aggressive use of the medium, especially when feeling protected by a sense of righteousness and by claims to be acting in defense of the [[national interest]]. Political figures have also used online media for particular causes. In social media, there has been the use of derogatory terms in reference to minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Erika Kinetz, "New Numerology of Hate Grows in Burma", Irrawaddy, 29 April 2013 http://www.irrawaddy.org/religion/new-numerology-of-hate-grows-in-burma.html. Hereward Holland, "Facebook in Myanmar: Amplifying Hate Speech?," Al Jazeera, 14 June 2014; Steven Kiersons, "The Colonial Origins of Hate Speech in Burma", The Sentinel Project, 28 October 2013, https://thesentinelproject.org/2013/10/28/the-colonial-origins-of-hate-speech-in-burma/ ., http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/06/facebook-myanmar-rohingya-amplifying-hate-speech-2014612112834290144.html&lt;/ref&gt; In this complex situation, a variety of actors has begun to mobilize, seeking to offer responses that can avoid further violence. Facebook has sought to take a more active role in monitoring the uses of the social network platform in Myanmar, developing [[Partnership|partnerships]] with local organizations and making guidelines on reporting problems accessible in Burmese.&lt;ref&gt;Tim McLaughlin, "Facebook takes steps to combat hate speech", The Myanmar Times, 25 July 2014. http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/11114-facebook-standards-marked-for-translation.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The local civil society has constituted a strong voice in openly condemning the spread of online hate speech, but at the same time calling for alternatives to [[censorship]]. Among the most innovative responses has been Panzagar, which in Burmese means "flower speech", a campaign launched by blogger and activist [[Nay Phone Latt]] to openly oppose hate speech. The goal of the initiative was offering a joyful example of how people can interact, both online and offline.&lt;ref&gt;San Yamin Aung, "Burmese Online Activist Discusses Campaign Against Hate Speech", Irrawaddy, http://www.irrawaddy.org/interview/hate-speech-pours-poison-heart.html&lt;/ref&gt; Local activists have been focussed upon local solutions, rather than trying to mobilize [[Civil society|global civil society]] on these issues. This is in contrast to some other online campaigns that have been able to attract the world's attention towards relatively neglected problems. Initiatives such as those promoted by the [[Save Darfur Coalition]] for the [[War in Darfur|civil war in Sudan]], or the organization [[Invisible Children]] with the [[Kony 2012|Kony2012]] campaign that denounced the atrocities committed by the [[Lord's Resistance Army|Lord Resistance Army]], are popular examples. As commentaries on these campaigns have pointed out, such global responses may have negative repercussions on the ability for local solutions to be found&lt;ref&gt;Schomerus, 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Private companies ===
Internet intermediaries have developed disparate definitions of hate speech and guidelines to regulate it. Some companies do not use the term hate speech, but have a descriptive list of terms related to it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Yahoo! ====
[[Yahoo!]]'s terms of service prohibit the posting of "content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, [[Harassment|harassing]], tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, [[Defamation|libellous]], invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable".&lt;ref&gt;http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/smallbusiness/bizmail/spam/spam-44.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Twitter ====
In December of 2017, [[Twitter]] began enforcing new policies towards hate speech, banning multiple accounts as well as setting new guidelines for what will be allowed on their platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/18/16789606/twitter-new-safety-policies-hate-groups|title=Twitter starts enforcing new policies on violence, abuse, and hateful conduct|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an entire page in the Twitter Help Center devoted to describing their Hateful Conduct Policy, as well as their enforcement procedures. The top of this page states “Freedom of expression means little if voices are silenced because people are afraid to speak up. We do not tolerate behavior that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence another person’s voice. If you see something on Twitter that violates these rules, please report it to us.” Twitter’s definition of [[hate speech]] ranges from “violent threats” and “wishes for the physical harm, death, or disease of individuals or groups” to “repeated and/or non-consensual slurs, epithets, racist and sexist tropes, or other content that degrades someone.”

Punishments for violations range from suspending a user’s ability to tweet until they take down their offensive/ hateful post to the removal of an account entirely. In a statement following the implementation of their new policies, Twitter said “In our efforts to be more aggressive here, we may make some mistakes and are working on a robust appeals process” . . . “We’ll evaluate and iterate on these changes in the coming days and weeks, and will keep you posted on progress along the way”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/hateful-conduct-policy|title=Hateful conduct policy|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes come amidst a time where action is being taken to prevent hate speech around the globe, including new laws in Europe which pose fines for sites unable to address [[hate speech]] reports within 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42510868|title=Germany to enforce hate speech law|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== YouTube ====
[[YouTube]], a subsidiary of the tech company [[Google]], has outlined a clear “Hate Speech Policy” amidst several other user policies on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2801939?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=2803176|title=Hate speech policy - YouTube Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy is worded as such: “We encourage free speech and try to defend your right to express unpopular points of view, but we don't permit hate speech. Hate speech refers to content that promotes violence against or has the primary purpose of inciting hatred against individuals or groups based on certain attributes, such as: race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status, sexual orientation/gender identity”. YouTube has built in a user reporting system in order to counteract the growing trend of hate speech. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802027|title=Report inappropriate content - Android - YouTube Help|website=support.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most popular deterrents against hate speech, users are able to anonymously report another user for content they deem inappropriate. The content is then reviewed against YouTube policy and age restrictions, and either taken down or left alone.

==== Facebook ====
[[Facebook]]'s terms forbid content that is harmful, threatening or which has potential to stir hatred and incite violence. In its community standards, Facebook elaborates that "Facebook removes hate speech, which includes content that directly attacks people based on their: race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender or gender identity, or serious [[Disability|disabilities]] or [[Disease|diseases]]". &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards&lt;/ref&gt; It further states that "We allow humour, [[satire]] or social commentary related to these topics, and we believe that when people use their authentic identity, they are more responsible when they share this kind of commentary. For that reason, we ask that Page owners associate their name and Facebook Profile with any content that is insensitive, even if that content does not violate our policies. As always, we urge people to be conscious of their audience when sharing this type of content."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Facebook’s hate speech policies are enforced by 7,500 content reviewers. Because this requires difficult decision making, controversy arises among content reviewers over enforcement of policies. Some users seem to feel as though the enforcement is inconsistent. One apt past example is two separate but similarly graphic postings that wished death to members of a specific religion. Both post were flagged by users and reviewed by Facebook staff. However only one was removed even though they carried almost identical sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enforcement-hate-speech-rules-mistakes|title=Facebook's Uneven Enforcement of Hate Speech Rules Allows Vile Posts to Stay Up|last=Tobin|first=Ariana|date=|work=Propublica|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a quote regarding hate speech on the platform, Facebook Vice President of Global Operations, Justin Osofky stated, “We’re sorry for the mistakes we have made — they do not reflect the community we want to help build…We must do better."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enforcement-hate-speech-rules-mistakes|title=Facebook’s Uneven Enforcement of Hate Speech Rules Allows Vile Posts to Stay Up|last=Tobin|first=Ariana|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
There has been additional controversy due to the specificity of Facebook's [[hate speech]]  policies. On many occasions there have been reports of status updates and comments that users feel are insensitive and convey hatred. However these posts do not technically breach any Facebook policies because their speech does not attack others based on the company's list of protected classes.   For example, the statement “Female sports reporters need to be hit in the head with hockey pucks," would not be considered hate speech on Facebook’s platform and therefore would not be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/13/technology/facebook-hate-speech-quiz.html|title=What Does Facebook Consider Hate Speech? Take Our Quiz|last=Carlsen|first=Audrey|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the company protects against gender based hatred, it does not protect against hatred based on occupation.
 
Facebook also tries to accommodate users who promote other hate speech content with the intent of criticizing it. In these cases, users are required make it clear that their intention is to educate others. If this intention is unclear then Facebook reserves the right to censor the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/objectionable_content/|title=Community Standards: Objectionable Content|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Facebook initially flags content that may contain hate speech, they then designate it to a Tier 1, 2, and 3 scale, based on the content’s severity. Tier 1 is the most severe and Tier 3 is the least. Tier 1 includes anything that conveys “violent speech or support for death/disease/harm.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bgr.com/2018/04/24/facebook-community-standards-content-policy-nudity-sexual-content-hate-speech/|title=This is what Facebook won’t let you post|last=Mills|first=Chris|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tier 2 is classified as content that slanders another user's image mentally, physically, or morally. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/objectionable_content/hate_speech/|title=Community Guidelines: Objectionable Content|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tier 3 includes anything that can potentially exclude or discriminate against others, or that uses slurs about protected groups, but does not necessarily apply to arguments to restrict immigration or criticism of existing immigration policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/objectionable_content/hate_speech/|title=Community Guidelines: Objectionable Content|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Microsoft ====
[[Microsoft]] has specific rules concerning hate speech for a variety of its [[Application software|applications]]. Its [[policy]] for mobile phones prohibits applications that "contain any content that advocates discrimination, hatred, or violence based on considerations of race, ethnicity, national origin, language, gender, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, status as a veteran, or membership in any other social group."&lt;ref&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh184842(v=vs.105).aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The company has also rules regarding online gaming, which prohibit any communication that is indicative of "hate speech, controversial religious topics and sensitive current or historical events".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/legal/codeofconduct&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media and information literacy ===
{{Main|Media literacy}}

[[Media Literacy|Media and Information Literacy]] aims to help people to engage in a [[Information society|digital society]] by being able to use, understand, inquire, create, communicate and think critically; while being able to effectively access, organize, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/themes/media-and-information-literacy&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Citizenship]] education focuses on preparing individuals to be informed and responsible citizens through the study of rights, freedoms, and responsibilities and has been variously employed in societies emerging from violent conflict&lt;ref&gt;Osler and Starksey, 2005{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One of its main objectives is raising awareness on the political, social and cultural rights of individuals and groups, including [[freedom of speech]] and the responsibilities and social implications that emerge from it. The concern of [[Citizenship education (subject)|citizenship education]] with hate speech is twofold: it encompasses the knowledge and skills to identify hate speech, and should enable individuals to counteract messages of hatred. One of its current challenges is adapting its goals and strategies to the digital world, providing not only [[argumentative]] but also [[Technology|technological]] knowledge and skills that a citizen may need to counteract online hate speech. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Information literacy]] cannot avoid issues such as rights to free expression and privacy, critical citizenship and fostering [[empowerment]] for [[Participation (decision making)|political participation]]&lt;ref&gt;Mossberger et al. 2008{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Multiple and complementary literacies become critical. The emergence of new technologies and social media has played an important role in this shift. Individuals have evolved from being only [[Consumer|consumers]] of media messages to producers, creators and curator of information, resulting in new models of participation that interact with traditional ones, like [[voting]] or joining a [[political party]]. Teaching strategies are changing accordingly, from fostering critical reception of media messages to include empowering the creation of media content&lt;ref&gt;Hoechsmann and Poyntz, 2012{{full|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The concept of media and information literacy itself continues to evolve, being augmented by the dynamics of the Internet. It is beginning to embrace issues of [[Identity politics|identity]], ethics and rights in [[cyberspace]]&lt;ref&gt;See Paris Declaration: Paris Declaration on MIL in the Digital Era. http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-andinformation/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/in-focus-articles/2014/paris-declaration-on-mediaand-information-literacy-adopted/&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of these skills can be particularly important when identifying and responding to hate speech online.

Series of initiatives aimed both at providing information and practical tools for Internet users to be active [[Digital citizen|digital citizens]]:
* ‘No place for hate' by [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), [[United States]];
* ‘In other words' project by [[Province of Mantua|Provincia di Mantova]] and the [[European Commission]];
* ‘Facing online hate' by [[MediaSmarts]], [[Canada]];
* ‘No hate speech movement' by Youth Department of the [[Council of Europe]], [[Europe]];&lt;ref&gt;The ‘No Hate Speech Movement' is a regional campaign that encompasses 50 countries far beyond the European Continent. Although the campaign has common goals and develops joint strategies, the particular projects and initiatives rune in every country are the responsibility of the National coordinators and subject to the capacity and resources in each country.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ‘Online hate' by the [[Online Hate Prevention Institute]], [[Australia]].
Education is also seen as being a tool against hate speech. Laura Geraghty from the ‘No Hate Speech Movement' affirmed: "Education is key to prevent hate speech online. It is necessary to raise awareness and empower people to get online in a responsible way; however, you still need the legal background and instruments to prosecute hate crimes, including hate speech online, otherwise the preventive aspect won't help".&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Laura Geraghty, No Hate Speech Movement, 25 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Paolo Cirio''' is a [[conceptual artist]], [[hacktivist]] and [[cultural critic]].

Cirio's work embodies [[hacker ethics]], such as open access, privacy policies, and disrupting economic, legal, and political models. He received a number of legal threats for his Internet art performances with practices such as hacking, piracy, leaking sensitive information, identity theft, and cyber attacks.

Paolo Cirio is known for having exposed over 200,000 [[Cayman Islands]] offshore firms with the work ''Loophole for All''[https://paolocirio.net/work/loophole-for-all/] in 2013; the hacking of Facebook through publishing 1 million users on a dating website with ''Face to Facebook'' in 2011; the theft of 60000 financial news articles with ''Daily Paywall''[https://paolocirio.net/work/daily-paywall/] in 2014 and of e-books from Amazon.com with ''Amazon Noir''[https://paolocirio.net/work/amazon-noir/] in 2006; defrauding Google with ''GWEI''[https://paolocirio.net/work/gwei/] in 2005; and the obfuscation of 15 million U.S. criminal records with ''Obscurity''[https://paolocirio.net/work/obscurity/] in 2016. His early works include his cyber attacks against [[NATO]] and reporting on its military operations since 2001[http://paolocirio.net/work/nato_cyber_attack/]. 

==Career==
Paolo Cirio has won a number of awards, including [[Prix Ars Electronica|Golden Nica]] first prize at [[Ars Electronica]] in 2013; the [[Eyebeam (organization)|Eyebeam]] Fellowship in 2012; and [[Transmediale]] second prize 2008, among others.

Cirio has exhibited in international museums and institutions, he regularly gives public lectures and workshops at leading universities, and his artworks have been covered by hundreds of media outlets worldwide.

==2001 - 2004==
In 2002, Cirio's first international action was called Anti-NATO Day. As an act of [[Hacktivism]] he staged a [[virtual sit-in]] ([[DDoS]] attack) in the [[NATO]] website through a [[Flash Player]] script. The [[Canadian Department of National Defence]] investigated the action&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=IWS INFOCON | first= | title=OCIPEP Daily Brief Number: DOB02-071 | publisher=The Information Warfare Site | url=http://www.mail-archive.com/infocon@infowarrior.org/msg00067.html | location= | date=30 May 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Eisenhower Institute]] used it as a case study to identify future vulnerabilities in space security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=[[Eisenhower Institute]] | first= | title=Space Security 2013 | publisher=[[Eisenhower Institute]] | location=Washington, D.C, | year=2004 | isbn=0920231365 | page=159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cirio promoted the action through an [[anti-war]] web portal called StopTheNato.org, which he launched in 2001 and updated periodically until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Politics of Globalization. | publisher=SAGE | year=2009 | isbn=9788178299471 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Cirio joined the Illegal Art Show network, which organized street art happenings in Italy in line with the [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]-philosophy. They occupied public spaces and invited artists to create artwork. Cirio created several [[street art]] pieces &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ullrich | first=Andreas | title=International Sticker Award | publisher=Wildsmile Studios | location=Berlin | year=2006 | isbn=978-3-89955-151-8 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organized three such events independently: two in Turin in 2004 and a third in London in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Jelinek | first=Alana | title=This is Not Art | publisher=I.B.Tauris | year=2013 | isbn=9781848858572 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005 - 2007==
In 2005, Cirio hacked Google's [[AdSense]] service by creating [[internet bots]] for a [[click fraud]] in order to buy Google's shares with its own money. In an attempt to stop the project, Google sent a cease and desist letter to the artists mentioning legal consequences for the project.[http://www.googlewilleatitself.com/pages/google/legalletter_e.html] Cirio worked on the project ''Google Will Eat Itself'' ''(GWEI)'' in conjunction with Alessandro Ludovico and Ubermorgen. The project questioned the information monopoly of [[Google]] and its revenue model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Dewey | first = Caitlin | title = Google Will Eat Itself: A Q&amp;A with the creators of a subversive, oddly timeless piece of conceptual art | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 2014-03-21 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/03/21/google-will-eat-itself-a-qa-with-the-creators-of-a-subversive-oddly-timeless-piece-of-conceptual-art/ | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006 he eluded the protection from [[Amazon.com]] with [[internet bots]] using the front door of the [[Amazon.com#Content search|"search inside"]] service. He scraped complete texts of books, reassembled them into PDF files, and redistributed them for free. The company refused to comment on the action.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript from the lecture delivered at the University Paris 8 on 4 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with Alessandro Ludovico and Ubermorgen, Cirio created the project ''Amazon Noir'' to criticize the abuse of [[copyright laws]] for the protection of digital content.

''Face to Facebook'', ''Amazon Noir'' and ''Google Will Eat Itself'' together form the ''Hacking Monopolism Trilogy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cantz | first=Hatje | title=ORIGIN | publisher=[[Ars Electronica]] | location=Linz | year=2011 | isbn=9783775731805 | page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cirio, Paolo and Alessandro Ludovicio. 2013. ''The hacking monopolism trilogy''. ISEA International. http://hdl.handle.net/2123/9673.&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 - 2010==
Between 2008 and 2010, Cirio worked on experimental storytelling which involves actors and audiences for presenting real facts and issues through fictional stories across multiple media platforms. He called this technique of documentary fiction &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Campanini | first=Cristiana | title=Antologia della webletteratura | publisher=Il Foglio Letterario | location=Italy | year=2010 | isbn=9788876062643 | page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Recombinant Fiction."  This socially engaged genre of [[transmedia storytelling]] has resulted in two projects: ''Drowning NYC'' (2010) and ''The Big Plot'' (2009).

In 2010, in reaction to the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], Cirio created the piece ''P2P Gift Credit Card - Gift Finance''. Cirio issued thousands of illicit VISA credit cards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Lechner | first =Marie | title =Credit Revolver | page = 10 | publisher =[[Libération]] | date = 2011-05-07 | url = http://www.liberation.fr/medias/01012335927-paolo-cirio-credit-revolver | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to design a creative [[monetary policy]], named "Gift Finance", which is a participatory and interest-free [[basic income guarantee]] system. In the following years, he presented the projects in relation to the economic recession and the related [[Occupy Wall Street]] protests.

==2011 - 2012==
Since 2011, Cirio has been addressing the cultural shift and mainstream media attention toward popular perceptions of privacy and ownership of public and personal information, with the projects ''Street Ghosts'', ''Persecuting.US'', and ''Face to Facebook''. The methodology used to create these artworks was eventually formalized in a series called ''Anti-Social Sculptures''.

In 2011, Cirio created ''Face to Facebook'' with Alessandro Ludovico. For this piece, Cirio scraped one million [[Facebook]] profiles, filtered them with [[artificial intelligence]] for facial recognition software, and published 250,000 of them onto Lovely-Faces.com, a mock dating website designed by Cirio, with the profiles sorted according to facial expressions. This resulted in eleven lawsuit threats, five death threats, and four legal letters from Facebook[http://www.face-to-facebook.net/legal.php]. Within a few days, the project was covered by over a thousand media outlets [http://www.face-to-facebook.net/press-coverage.php] from around the world including [[CNN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Allsop | first = Laura | title = Art 'hacktivists' take on Facebook | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = 2011-02-11 | url = http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-11/world/artists.facebook.project_1_facebook-profile-pictures-publicly-available-information | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox News]], [[Tagesschau (Germany)|Tagesschau]], and [[Apple Daily]].

With the ''Street Ghosts'' project in 2012, Cirio recontextualized photos of individuals found on [[Google Street View]], by printing and posting life-sized pictures of people in the exact locations where they were photographed. The posters were [[wheat paste|wheatpasted]] on the walls of public buildings without authorization. These interventions took place in public spaces of several major cities, including London, Berlin, and New York. 

In 2012, his web project ''Persecuting.US'' profiled the political affiliations of over one million Americans who used Twitter during the months leading up to the United States presidential election of 2012. Cirio appropriated the data and algorithmically determined users’ political affiliations to raise awareness on voter  profiling and polarization in social bubbles  that  can be targeted for political manipulation.

==2013 - 2014==
In 2013, Cirio investigated offshore financial systems with the project ''Loophole for All''. The project made public the list of all the companies registered in the [[Cayman Islands]] for the first time, exposing tax evasion practices by counterfeiting [[Certificate of Incorporation]] documents signed with his name. This information was published on the website [http://Loophole4All.com Loophole4All.com], engaging international participation through selling the real identities of anonymous Cayman companies for 99 cents. This provocation elicited reactions from Cayman authorities and global banks as well as legal threats by multinational companies, international law firms, and local Cayman businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Paolo Cirio |year=2015 |date= |title= Loophole4All.com by Paolo Cirio in Manchester at FutureEverything 2015 - Loophole for All | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMT-2yW6Dsk |format= |medium= |publisher=FutureEverything |location=Manchester |accessdate=2015-02-26 |time= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After three weeks of selling conceptual and subversive artworks in the form of limited editions of firms’ identities, [[PayPal]] suspended the account, claiming the sales activity was in violation of PayPal's Acceptable Use Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|people=Laura Flanders | date=15 April 2013 |title=Tax Loopholes for All! |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/173826/tax-loopholes-all# |publisher=''The Nation''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|people=Yanyan Huang |date=7 January 2014 |title=Paolo Cirio Discovers a Tax Loophole for All |url=http://thewildmagazine.com/blog/paolo-cirio-loophole-for-all/ |publisher=''The Wild'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209040639/http://thewildmagazine.com/blog/paolo-cirio-loophole-for-all/ |archivedate=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2014 the project won the [[Prix Ars Electronica|Golden Nica]], first prize of [[Prix Ars Electronica]].

In 2014, Cirio created the ''Global Direct'' project, a creative [[political philosophy]] that the artist outlined for worldwide [[participatory democracy]] within the potentials offered by the Internet. To illustrate the conceptual work, the artist drew a series of fifteen [[Organizational chart]] to inspire values and functions for a global and participatory society. The fifteen diagrams of ''Global Direct'' were informed by the artist’s research into the [[social science]] of ancient, contemporary, and [[emergent democracy]].

In 2014 Cirio created ''Daily Paywall'' by hacking the [[paywall]] of The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and The Economist. Through his paid subscriptions and [[Scripting language]] hack, he obtained over 60,000 news articles published during the course of 2014. The [[pay-per-view]] content was republished for free on the website [http://DailyPaywall.com DailyPaywall.com] and the artist proposed to pay people to read featured financial news articles. Cirio conceived a provocative [[sharing economy]] model, where [[crowdsource]] practices were put in place to allow and incentivize people to access information on global economic matters. Using this system, readers were able to earn money for every quiz they correctly completed, and journalists were able to claim compensation for their work. Everyone could donate any amount to [[crowdfund]] the system. After a few days, the ISP hosting [http://DailyPaywall.com DailyPaywall.com] disabled the site after receiving complaints of international [[Copyright infringement]] from [[Pearson PLC]], the largest education and publisher company in the world and owner of the Financial Times and The Economist. Additionally The Wall Street Journal proceeded to terminate the artist’s subscription due to a violation of their Terms of Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Paolo Cirio |year=2015 |date= |title=FutureEverything 2015: Paolo Cirio | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYRubeOE8Sk |format= |medium= |publisher=FutureEverything |location=Manchester |accessdate=2015-04-26 |time= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]] sold both The Economist and the Financial Times and Cirio republished the whole content of [http://DailyPaywall.com DailyPaywall.com]. He entire artistic act was pre-scripted as a performance for illustrating critical issues on the [[Information economy]] that Cirio outlined within the launch of the project.

==2015 - 2016==
During the spring of 2015, Cirio conducted the street art campaign ''OVEREXPOSED'' concerning the aftermath of [[Edward Snowden]]’s [[global surveillance disclosures]]. He disseminated on public walls unauthorized photos of high-ranking U.S. intelligence officials of the [[NSA]], [[CIA]] and [[FBI]], who were accountable for political measures or advocacy for mass surveillance and espionage programs. The photos, mostly [[selfies]] from Facebook and Twitter accounts of civilians, were rendered with a particular technique called ''High Definition Stencils'' invented by the artist for the street art campaign that took place in NYC, London, Berlin and Paris between April and May 2015. The intervention generated media coverage and public interest internationally &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | title =Italian ‘Banksy’ exposes ‘masterminds of spying’ in street art campaign  | page = 10 | publisher =[[Russia Today]] | date = 2015-07-12 | url = http://www.rt.com/news/273196-italy-artist-nsa-surveillance/ | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly in Germany &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Beitzer | first =Hannah | title =Geheimdienst-Chefs ganz privat - und plötzlich öffentlich | page = | publisher =[[Sueddeutsche Zeitung]] | date = 2015-05-23 | url = http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/kunst-gegen-ueberwachung-geheimdienst-chefs-ganz-privat-und-ploetzlich-oeffentlich-1.2491926 | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Cirio created the project ''Obscurity'' in which he obfuscated over 10 million online mugshots and the criminal records of victims of [[mass incarceration]] in United States. The project addressed the unregulated [[mug shot publishing industry]] that anonymous internet companies exploit in order to shame and blackmail people who have been arrested in the U.S. regardless of their charges and trial verdicts. Cirio targeted six mugshot websites and blurred millions of mugshots and shuffled names listed. In response he received support from mugshot extortion victims and was subject to a legal threat from Mugshots.com, an anonymous firm in [[Nevis]], and US Data ltd., a Texan firm owning a few mugshot websites. With ''Obscurity'', Cirio questioned the [[Right to Be Forgotten]] law, which has been opposed by major search engine companies in the U.S. Ultimately, to point out the accountability of search engines in exposing personal sensitive information, Cirio designed the campaign ''Right2Remove.us'' to introduce a privacy policy adapting the [[Right to Be Forgotten]] law to the United States. With the ''Right to Remove'' policy, Cirio suggested types of sensitive personal data that should be removed from online search results to protect specific categories of vulnerable individuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2545">A '''Pending Meal''' is one paid for at a restaurant or other food joint, to be made available to any future visitor who asks for it. The Pending Meal community [[initiative]] was started on social media in April 2015 by Sarah Rizvi, focusing on restaurants in Dubai. Once the news of the initiative started to spread, many local restaurants were willing to tie up and provide their support too. The idea spread to other areas including [[Sharjah]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Ras Al Khaimah]], U.S.A, Canada, Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan.

The Pending Meal movement encourages people to pay for someone else’s meal at a food outlet so the less fortunate can walk in and eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/your-say/your-view/pending-meal-pay-for-someone-else-s-food-1.1531685|title=Pending Meal: pay for someone else's food|first=Huda|last=Tabrez|date=8 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative is not limited to [[United Arab Emirates]] only and the founder believes that wherever there is a hungry mouth, there is a Pending Meal to feed. The idea originated from the concept of [[suspended coffee]] practiced in some coffee shops in [[Naples]]. Customers would pay for their own coffee and when they wanted to, could pay for an extra ‘suspended coffee’ or a '[[suspended meal]]' which was meant for the less fortunate. Thus, a person who was hungry or thirsty could walk into the cafe and ask if there was a suspended coffee or suspended meal that they could drink or eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.bayut.com/pending-meal-movement-feeding-the-less-fortunate/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715055120/http://blog.bayut.com/pending-meal-movement-feeding-the-less-fortunate/ |archivedate=2015-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no limit to how much one can donate to the cause. “There have been people who have paid in advance for the meal of just one person and some have even paid for 15,” said Rizvi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/charity-begins-restaurants-043546130.html|title=Charity begins at restaurants|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pending Meal initiative is not a charity organization and does not collect funds (in any form). The initiative is purely encouraging people to give back to community by providing less fortunate with a meal so that no one has to stay hungry.

A '''polychotomy''' (päl′i kät′ə mē; plural ''polychotomies'') is a division or separation into many parts or classes. Polychotomy is a generalization of [[dichotomy]], which is a polychotomy of exactly two parts.  In [[evolutionary biology]], the term '''polychotomy''' can also be considered a historically based misspelling of [[polytomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, David J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28432">'''Positive behavior support''' ('''PBS''') is a behavior management system used to understand what maintains an individual's challenging [[behavior]]. People's inappropriate behaviors are difficult to change because they are functional; they serve a purpose for them. These behaviors are supported by [[reinforcement (psychology)|reinforcement]] in the environment. In the case of students and children, often adults in a child’s environment will reinforce his or her undesired behaviors because the child will receive objects and/or attention because of his behavior. [[Functional behavior assessment]]s (FBAs) clearly describe behaviors, identify the contexts (events, times, and situation) that predict when behavior will and will not occur, and identify consequences that maintain the behavior. They also summarize and create a [[hypothesis]] about the behavior, directly observe the behavior and take data to get a baseline. The positive behavior support process involves goal identification, [[information gathering]], [[hypothesis]] development, support plan design, [[implementation]] and monitoring.

In order for techniques to work in decreasing undesired behavior, they should include: feasibility, desirability, and effectiveness. Strategies are needed that teachers and parents are able and willing to use and that affect the child's ability to participate in community and school activities. Positive behavior support is increasingly being recognized as a strategy that meets these criteria. By changing stimulus and reinforcement in the environment and teaching the child to strengthen deficit skill areas the student's behavior changes in ways that allow him/her to be included in the general education setting. The three areas of deficit skills identified in the article were [[communication skills]], [[social skill]]s, and [[Decision making|self-management]] skills. Re-directive therapy as positive behavior support is especially effective in the parent–child relationship. Where other treatment plans have failed re-directive therapy allows for a positive interaction between parents and children. Positive behavior support is successful in the school setting because it is primarily a teaching method (Swartz, 1999).{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==In schools==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=December 2012}} 
Schools are required to conduct functional behavioral assessment (FBA) and use positive behavior support with students who are identified as [[disabled]] and are at risk for [[expulsion (education)|expulsion]], alternative school placement, or more than 10 days of [[suspension (school punishment)|suspension]]. Even though FBA is required under limited circumstances it is good professional practice to use a problem-solving approach to managing problem behaviors in the school setting (Crone &amp; Horner 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Crone, D. A., &amp; Horner, R. H. (2003). Building positive behavior support systems in schools: Functional behavioral assessment. New York: Guildford Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of Positive Behavior Intervention Supports (PBIS) in schools is widespread (Sugai &amp; Horner, 2002)&lt;ref name="Sugai, G. 2002"&gt;Sugai, G., &amp; Horner, R. H. (2002). The evolution of discipline practices: School-wide positive behavior supports. Child and Family Behavior Therapy, 24, 23-50.&lt;/ref&gt; in part because it is a professional skill in early special education programs (as opposed to Rogerian counseling). The program offers a primary, secondary, and tertiary level of intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, T.J. and Sugai, G. (2005). Preventing Problem Behaviors: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Level Prevention Interventions for Young Children. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention'', 2 (3), 125–144 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; A basic tenet of the PBIS approach includes identifying students in one of three categories based on risk for behavior problems. Once identified, students receive services in one of three categories: primary, secondary, or tertiary. To help practitioners with differences in interventions used at each of the levels the professional literature refers to a three-tiered (levels) model (Stewart, Martella, Marchand-Martella, &amp; Benner, 2005; Sugai, Sprague, Horner &amp; Walker, 2000;&lt;ref name="Sugai, G. 2000"&gt;Sugai, G., Sprague, J.R., Horner, R.H., &amp; Walker, H.M.

Journal of Emo- tional and Behavioral Disorders, 4, 193–256.&lt;/ref&gt; Interventions are specifically developed for each of these levels with the goal of reducing the risk for academic or social failure. These interventions may be behavioral and or academic interventions incorporating scientifically proven forms of instruction such as [[direct instruction]].&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, R.M., Martella, R.C., Marchand-Martella, N.E. and Benner, G.J (2005) Three-Tier Models of Reading and Behavior.

(2001) School-Wide And Individualized Effective Behavior Support: An Explanation And An Example. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3 (1), 51–75 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Primary prevention]] strategies focus on interventions used on a school-wide basis for all students (Sugai &amp; Horner, 2002).&lt;ref name="Sugai, G. 2002"/&gt; PBS (positive behavioral supports) use for other than a designated population group has neither been approved by the professions or the public-at-large.This level of prevention is considered "primary" because all students are exposed in the same way, and at the same level, to the intervention. The primary prevention level is the largest by number. Approximately 80–85% of students who are not at risk for behavior problems respond in a positive manner to this prevention level.&lt;ref&gt;Mack D. Burke, PhD, Kevin Ayres, MA &amp; Shanna Hagan-Burke, PhD. (2004): Preventing School-Based Antisocial Behaviors with School-Wide Positive Behavioral Support. ''JEIBI'', 1 (1), 66–74 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Primary prevention strategies include, but are not limited to, using effective teaching practices and curricula, explicitly teaching behavior that is acceptable within the school environment, focusing on ecological arrangement and systems within the school, consistent use of precorrection procedures, using active supervision of common areas, and creating reinforcement systems that are used on a school-wide basis (Lewis, Sugai, &amp; Colvin, 1998;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, T.

Maximizing student learning: The effects of a comprehensive school-based program for preventing problem behaviors. Journal of Emotional &amp; Behavioral Disorders, 10(3), 136-148.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Secondary prevention]] strategies involve students (i.e., 10–15% of the school population) who do not respond to the primary prevention strategies and are at risk for academic failure or behavior problems but are not in need of individual support (Nelson, et al., 2002).{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} Interventions at the secondary level often are delivered in small groups to maximize time and effort and should be developed with the unique needs of the students within the group. Examples of these interventions include social support such as [[social skills training]] (e.g., explicit instruction in skill-deficit areas, friendship clubs, check in/check out, [[role playing]]) or academic support (i.e., use of research-validated intervention programs and [[tutor]]ing). Additionally, secondary programs could include behavioral support approaches (e.g., simple Functional Behavioral Assessments [FBA], precorrection, self-management training). Even with the heightened support within secondary level interventions, some students (1–7%) will need the additional assistance at the tertiary level (Walker et al., 1996).&lt;ref name="Walker, H. M. 1996"/&gt;

[[Tertiary prevention]] programs focus on students who display persistent patterns of disciplinary problems (Nelson, Benner, Reid, Epstein, &amp; Currin, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, J. R., Benner, G., Reid, R., Epstein, M. H., &amp; Currin, D. (2002) The convergent validity of office discipline referrals with the TRF. Journal of Emotional and Behavioral Disorders, 10, 181-189.&lt;/ref&gt;
Tertiary-level programs are also called intensive or individualized interventions and are the most comprehensive and complex.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"/&gt; The interventions within this level are strength-based in that the complexity and intensity of the intervention plans directly reflect the complexity and intensity of the behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Tincani, M. (2007). Moving forward: Positive behavior support and applied behavior analysis. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 8, 492–499. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; Students within the tertiary level continue involvement in primary and secondary intervention programs and receive additional support as well. These supports could include use of full FBA, [[de-escalation]] training for the student, heightened use of natural supports (e.g., family members, friends of the student), and development of a Behavior Intervention Plan (BIP).

Although comprehensive services are important for all students, a critical aspect of the three-tiered model is the identification of students at one of the three levels. One method of identifying students in need of interventions is to analyze office disciplinary referrals (ODR) taken at the school (Irvin et al., 2006).{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} ODRs may be a means of both identifying students' risk level for [[antisocial behavior]] and school failure (Walker et al., 1996). Researchers have advocated analyzing this naturally occurring data source as a relatively cheap, effective, and ongoing measurement device for PBS programs (Irvin et al., 2006;{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} Putnam, Luiselli, Handler, &amp; Jefferson, 2003;&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, R.F., Luiselli, J.K., Handler, M.W., &amp; Jefferson, G.L. (2003). Evaluating student discipline practices in a public school through behavioral assessment of office referrals. Behavior Modification, 27, 505–523.&lt;/ref&gt; Sprague et al., 2001;{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} Sugai et al., 2000;&lt;ref name="Sugai, G. 2000"/&gt; Tidwell, Flannery, &amp; Lewis-Palmer, 2003;&lt;ref&gt;Tidwell, A., Flannery, K.B., &amp; Lewis-Palmer, T. (2003). A description of elementary classroom discipline referral patterns. Preventing School Failure 48(1), 18-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Walker, Cheney, Stage, &amp; Blum, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, B., Cheney, D., Stage, S., &amp; Blum, C. (2005).Schoolwide screening and positive behavior support: Identifying and supporting students at risk of school failure. Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions, 7, 194-204.&lt;/ref&gt;

ODRs have also been shown to be effective in determining where students fall within a three-leveled model (Sugai et al., 2000),&lt;ref name="Sugai, G. 2000"/&gt; developing professional development as well as helping coordinate school efforts with other community agencies (Tobin &amp; Sugai, 1997;{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} Tobin, Sugai, &amp; Colvin, 2000),&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, T., Sugai, G., Colvin, G., (2000). Using Discipline Referrals to Make Decisions. NASSP Bulletin, 84(616), 106-117.&lt;/ref&gt; predicting school failure in older grades as well as delinquency (Sprague et al., 2001),{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} indicating types of behavior resulting in referrals (Putnam et al., 2003),&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, R.F., Luiselli, J.K., Handler, M.W., &amp; Jefferson, G.L. (2003). Evaluating student discipline practices in a public school through behavioral assessment of office referrals. Behavior Modification 27(4), 505-523.&lt;/ref&gt; and determination of the effectiveness of precorrection techniques (Oswald, Safran, &amp; Johanson, 2005).{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} Analyzing discipline referral data can also help school personnel identify where to improve ecological arrangements within a school and to recognize how to increase active supervision in common areas (Nelson, Martella, &amp; Galand, 1998;{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}} Nelson et al., 2002{{full citation needed|date=July 2011}}). A limitation of only using ODRs to measure behavior problems is that they have been found to be ineffective at measuring internalizing behavior problems such as anxiety, depression, and withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McIntosh|first1=K.|author2=Campbell, A.

==Functional behavior assessment==
Functional behavior assessment (FBA) emerged from [[applied behavior analysis]]. It is the first step in individual and cornerstone of a Positive Behavior Support plan.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, R.M., Martella, R.C. Marchand-Martella, N.E. &amp; Benner, G.J. (2005). Three-Tier Models of Reading and Behavior. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention'', 2 (3), 115–124 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment seeks to describe the behavior and environmental factors and setting events that predict the behavior in order to guide the development of effective support plans. Assessment lays the foundation of PBS. The assessment includes:
* a description of the problem behavior and its general setting of occurrence
* identification of events, times and situations that predict problem behavior
* identification of consequences that maintain behavior
* identification of the motivating function of behavior
* collection of direct observational data
* identification of alternative behavior that could replace the child's problem behavior (i.e., what a typical child does). Often this is measured through direct observation or standardized behavioral assessment instruments.

In some cases, the problem behavior identified in the functional behavior assessment is further analyzed by conducting a behavior chain analysis—in which the sequences of behavior that build up to the problem behavior become the focus.

The results of the assessment help in developing the individualized behavior support plan. This outlines procedures for teaching alternatives to the behavior problems, and redesign of the environment to make the problem behavior irrelevant, inefficient, and ineffective.

Another avenue of functional behavior assessment is growing in popularity—it is called behavior chain analysis. In behavior chain analysis, one looks at the progressive changes of behavior as they lead to problem behavior and then attempts to disrupt this sequence. Whereas FBA is concerned mostly with setting-antecedent-behavior-consequence relations, the behavior chain analysis looks at the progression of behavior, such as first the child may fidget, then he might begin to tease others, then he might start to throw things, and then finally hit another student.

==Behavioral strategies available==
There are many different behavioral strategies that PBS can use to encourage individuals to change their behavior. Some of these strategies are delivered through the consultation process to teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Luiselli, J.K., Putnam, R.F. &amp; Handler, M.W. (2001) Improving Discipline Practices In Public Schools: Description of a Whole-School and District-Wide Model Of Behavior Analysis Consultation. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2 (1), 18–25 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; The strong part of functional behavior assessment is that it allows interventions to directly address the function (purpose) of a problem behavior. For example, a child who acts out for attention could receive attention for alternative behavior ([[contingency management]]) or the teacher could make an effort to increase the amount of attention throughout the day (satiation). Changes in setting events or antecedents are often preferred by PBS because contingency management often takes more effort. Another tactic especially when dealing with disruptive behavior is to use information from a behavior chain analysis to disrupt the behavioral problem early in the sequence to prevent disruption.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, H., Colvin, J. &amp; Ramsey., E. (1996). Best practices in treating antisocial behavior in schools&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most commonly used approaches are:
* Modifying the environment or routine, using the [[Operant conditioning|three term contingency]], particularly [[antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedent]]s (such as [[school curriculum|curriculum]]), behavior, and/or consequences
* Providing an alternative to the undesired behavior (not the same as a reward; it should be an alternative that is readily available to the person. The thought behind this is that the person may, over time, learn to more independently seek out appropriate options rather than the undesired behavior(s)).
* Tactical ignoring of the behavior (also called extinction)
* Distracting the child
* [[Positive reinforcement]] for an appropriate behavior
* Changing expectations and demands placed upon the child
* Teaching the child new skills and behaviors
* Graded extinction and cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) such as [[desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]]
* Provide sensory based breaks to promote an optimal level of [[arousal]] and calming for increased use the replacement/alternative behavior
* Changing how people around the child react
* [[Child time-out|Time-out (child)]]
* [[Medication]]

==Behavior management program==
The main keys to developing a [[behavior management]] program include:
* Identifying the specific behaviors to address
* Establishing the goal for change and the steps required to achieve it
* Procedures for recognizing and monitoring changed behavior
* Choosing the appropriate behavioral strategies that will be most effective.

Through the use of effective behavior management at a school-wide level, PBS programs offer an effective method to reduce school crime and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, T.M. Gagnon, J.C., and Nelson, C.M. (2008). School-Wide Systems of Positive Behavior Support: A Framework for Reducing School Crime and Violence. ''Journal of Behavior Analysis of Offender and Victim: Treatment and Prevention'', 1 (3), 259–272.[http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent the most severe forms of problem behaviors, normal social behavior in these programs should be actively taught.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, L.S. and Johnston, S.J. (2008). Preventing Severe Problem Behavior in Young Children: The Behavior Education Program. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention'', 4 (3), 599–613. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequential management/contingency management==
Consequential management is a positive response to challenging behavior. It serves to give the person informed choice and an opportunity to learn. Consequences must be clearly related to the challenging behavior. For example, if a glass of water was thrown and the glass smashed, the consequence (restitution) would be for the person to clean up the mess and replace the glass. These sorts of consequences are consistent with normal social reinforcement contingencies.

Providing choices is very important and staff can set limits by giving alternatives that are related to a behavior they are seeking. It is important that the alternative is stated in a positive way and that words are used which convey that the person has a choice. For example:
* [[Coercive]] approach – "If you don't cut that out you'll have to leave the room."
* Positive approach – "You can watch TV quietly or leave the room."

==Implementation on a school-wide level==
The current trend of positive behavior support (PBS) is to use behavioral techniques to achieve [[cognitive]] [[goal]]s. The use of cognitive ideas becomes more apparent when PBS is used on a school-wide setting. A measurable goal for a school may be to reduce the level of violence, but a main goal might be to create a healthy, respectful, and safe learning, and teaching, environment.&lt;ref name="(Miller, Nickerson, &amp; Jimerson, 2009)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilman|first1=Rich |first2= E. Scott |last2=Huebner|first3= Michael J.|last3=Furlong|title=Handbook of Positive Psychology in Schools|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn= 978-1107030749}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=9780805863628|author=Miller, David N.|author2=Nickerson, Amanda B.|author3=Jimerson, Shane R.|last-author-amp=yes|edition=1st|title=Positive Psychology and School-Based Interventions|pages=293–299}}&lt;/ref&gt; PBS on a school-wide level is a system that can be used to create the "perfect" school, or at the very least a better school, particularly because before implementation it is necessary to develop a vision for what the school environment should look like in the future.&lt;ref name="Rhodes, V., Stevens, D., &amp; Hemmings, A., (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rhodes|first1=Virginia|author2=Stevens, Douglas|author3=Hemmings, Annette|last-author-amp=yes|title=Creating Positive Culture in a New Urban High School|journal=High School Journal|date=15 April 2011|volume=94|series=Spring 2011|issue=3|pages=82–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Horner et al. (2004), a colleague of Julie Ann Racino [[supported living]], [[family support]], [[community integration]], as cited in (Miller, Nickerson, &amp; Jimerson, 2009),&lt;ref name="(Miller, Nickerson, &amp; Jimerson, 2009)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=edited by Rich Gilman, E. Scott Huebner, Michael J.|title=Handbook of positive psychology in schools|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780805863628|author2=Miller, David N.|edition=1st|authorlink=Positive Psychology and School-Based Interventions|author3=Nickerson, Amanda B. and Jimerson, Shane R.|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; once a school decides to implement PBS, the following characteristics require addressing:

# define 3 to 5 school-wide expectations for appropriate behavior;
# actively teach the school-wide behavioral expectations to all students; 
# monitor and acknowledge students for engaging in behavioral expectations;
# correct problem behaviors using a consistently administered continuum of behavioral consequences
# gather and use information about student behavior to evaluate and guide decision making;
# obtain leadership of school-wide practices from an administrator committed to providing adequate support and resources; and
# procure [[school district|district-level]] support.

If adequate support and consistency using a positive behavior support program exists, then over time a school’s atmosphere will change for the better. PBS is capable of creating positive changes so pronounced that alumni would mention the differences upon a visit to the school. Such a program is able to create a positive atmosphere and culture in almost any school, but the support, resources, and consistency in using the program over time must be present.&lt;ref name="Rhodes, V., Stevens, D., &amp; Hemmings, A., (2011)"/&gt;

School-wide Positive behavior support (SW-PBS) consists of a broad range of systematic and individualized strategies for achieving important social and [[learning outcomes]] while preventing problem behavior with all students.&lt;ref&gt;OSEP Center on Positive Interventions and Support, [http://www.osepideasthatwork.org/toolkit/behvr_pos.asp "School-wide positive behavior support implementers’ blueprint and self-assessment"], 2004, April&lt;/ref&gt;

Such school-wide use of PBS has not been approved other than for special populations, and the work of Dr. Robert Horner, a leader of a Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Positive Behavioral Supports, was approved on the basis of non-use of aversive technology (e.g., restraints, electric shock, transfers to criminal justice) with any students, including individuals in the most restrictive placements.&lt;ref&gt;Racino, J.

{{Bayesian statistics}}

The '''principle of indifference''' (also called '''principle of insufficient reason''') is a rule for assigning [[epistemic probability|epistemic probabilities]]. Suppose that there are ''n'' &amp;gt; 1 [[mutually exclusive]] and [[collectively exhaustive]] possibilities. The principle of indifference states that if the ''n'' possibilities are indistinguishable except for their names, then each possibility should be assigned a probability equal to 1/''n''.

In [[Bayesian probability]], this is the simplest [[Prior probability#Uninformative priors|non-informative prior]]. The principle of indifference is meaningless under the [[Frequency probability|frequency interpretation of probability]],{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} in which probabilities are relative frequencies rather than degrees of belief in uncertain propositions, conditional upon state information.

==Examples==

The textbook examples for the application of the principle of indifference are [[coin]]s, [[dice]], and [[playing cards|cards]].

In a [[macroscopic]] system, at least, it must be assumed that the physical laws which govern the system are not known well enough to predict the outcome. As observed some centuries ago by [[John Arbuthnot]] (in the preface of ''Of the Laws of Chance'', 1692),

:It is impossible for a Die, with such determin'd force and direction, not to fall on such determin'd side, only I don't know the force and direction which makes it fall on such determin'd side, and therefore I call it Chance, which is nothing but the want of art....

Given enough time and resources,
there is no fundamental reason to suppose that suitably precise measurements could not be made, which would enable the prediction of the outcome of coins, dice, and cards with high accuracy: [[Persi Diaconis]]'s work with [[coin flipping#Physics|coin-flipping]] machines is a practical example of this.

===Coins===

A [[symmetry|symmetric]] coin has two sides, arbitrarily labeled ''heads'' and ''tails''. Assuming that the coin must land on one side or the other, the outcomes of a coin toss are mutually exclusive, exhaustive, and interchangeable. According to the principle of indifference, we assign each of the possible outcomes a probability of 1/2.

It is implicit in this analysis that the forces acting on the coin are not known with any precision. If the momentum imparted to the coin as it is launched were known with sufficient accuracy, the flight of the coin could be predicted according to the laws of mechanics. Thus the uncertainty in the outcome of a coin toss is derived (for the most part) from the uncertainty with respect to initial conditions. This point is discussed at greater length in the article on [[Coin flipping#Physics|coin flipping]].

===Dice===

A [[symmetry|symmetric]] [[dice|die]] has ''n'' faces, arbitrarily labeled from 1 to ''n''.
An ordinary cubical die has ''n'' = 6 faces,
although a symmetric die with different numbers of faces can be constructed;
see [[dice]].
We assume that the die will land on one face or another upwards,
and there are no other possible outcomes.
Applying the principle of indifference, we assign each of the possible outcomes a probability of 1/''n''.
As with coins,
it is assumed that the initial conditions of throwing the dice are not known
with enough precision to predict the outcome according to the laws of mechanics.
Dice are typically thrown so as to bounce on a table or other surface.
This interaction makes prediction of the outcome much more difficult.

The assumption of symmetry is crucial here. Suppose that we are asked to bet for or against the outcome "6". We might reason that there are two relevant outcomes here "6" or "not 6", and that these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. This suggests assigning the probability 1/2 to each of the two outcomes.

===Cards===

A standard deck contains 52 cards, each given a unique label in an arbitrary fashion, i.e. arbitrarily ordered. We draw a card from the deck; applying the principle of indifference, we assign each of the possible outcomes a probability of 1/52.

This example, more than the others, shows the difficulty of actually applying the principle of indifference in real situations. What we really mean by the phrase "arbitrarily ordered" is simply that we don't have any information that would lead us to favor a particular card. In actual practice, this is rarely the case: a new deck of cards is certainly not in arbitrary order, and neither is a deck immediately after a hand of cards. In practice, we therefore [[shuffling playing cards|shuffle]] the cards; this does not destroy the information we have, but instead (hopefully) renders our information practically unusable, although it is still usable in principle. In fact, some expert blackjack players can track aces through the deck; for them, the condition for applying the principle of indifference is not satisfied.

==Application to continuous variables==

Applying the principle of indifference incorrectly can easily lead to nonsensical results, especially in the case of multivariate, continuous variables.  A typical case of misuse is the following example.

*Suppose there is a cube hidden in a box. A label on the box says the cube has a side length between 3 and 5&amp;nbsp;cm.
* We don't know the actual side length, but we might assume that all values are equally likely and simply pick the mid-value of 4&amp;nbsp;cm.
* The information on the label allows us to calculate that the surface area of the cube is between 54 and 150&amp;nbsp;cm². We don't know the actual surface area, but we might assume that all values are equally likely and simply pick the mid-value of 102&amp;nbsp;cm².
* The information on the label allows us to calculate that the volume of the cube is between 27 and 125&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. We don't know the actual volume, but we might assume that all values are equally likely and simply pick the mid-value of 76&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
* However, we have now reached the impossible conclusion that the cube has a side length of 4&amp;nbsp;cm, a surface area of 102&amp;nbsp;cm², and a volume of 76&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;!

In this example, mutually contradictory estimates of the length, surface area, and volume of the cube arise because we have assumed three mutually contradictory distributions for these parameters: a [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]] for any one of the variables implies a non-uniform distribution for the other two. (The same paradox arises if we make it discrete: the side is either exactly 3&amp;nbsp;cm, 4&amp;nbsp;cm, or 5&amp;nbsp;cm, mutatis mutandis.)  In general, the principle of indifference does not indicate which variable (e.g. in this case, length, surface area, or volume) is to have a uniform epistemic probability distribution.

Another classic example of this kind of misuse is [[Bertrand's paradox (probability)|Bertrand's paradox]].  [[Edwin T. Jaynes]] introduced the [[principle of transformation groups]], which can yield an epistemic probability distribution for this problem.  This generalises the principle of indifference, by saying that one is indifferent between ''equivalent problems'' rather than indifference between propositions.  This still reduces to the ordinary principle of indifference when one considers a permutation of the labels as generating equivalent problems (i.e. using the permutation transformation group).  To apply this to the above box example, we have three random variables related by geometric equations.  If we have no reason to favour one trio of values over another, then our prior probabilities must be related by the rule for changing variables in continuous distributions.  Let ''L'' be the length, and ''V'' be the volume.  Then we must have

:&lt;math&gt;f(L) = \left|{\partial V \over \partial L}\right|f(V)=3 L^{2} f(L^{3})&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the [[probability density function]] (pdf) of the stated variable. This equation has a general solution: &lt;math&gt;f(L) = {K \over L}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''K'' is a normalization constant, determined by the range of ''L'', in this case equal to:

:&lt;math&gt;K^{-1}=\int_{3}^{5}{dL \over L} = \log\left({5 \over 3}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

To put this "to the test", we ask for the probability that the length is less than 4.  This has probability of:

:&lt;math&gt;Pr(L&lt;4)=\int_{3}^{4}{dL \over L \log({5 \over 3})}= {\log({4 \over 3}) \over \log({5 \over 3})} \approx 0.56&lt;/math&gt;.

For the volume, this should be equal to the probability that the volume is less than 4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 64.  The pdf of the volume is

:&lt;math&gt;f(V^{{1 \over 3}}) {1 \over 3} V^{-{2 \over 3}}={1 \over 3 V \log({5 \over 3})}&lt;/math&gt;.

And then probability of volume less than 64 is

:&lt;math&gt;Pr(V&lt;64)=\int_{27}^{64}{dV \over 3 V \log({5 \over 3})}={\log({64 \over 27}) \over 3 \log({5 \over 3})}={3 \log({4 \over 3}) \over 3 \log({5 \over 3})}={\log({4 \over 3}) \over \log({5 \over 3})} \approx 0.56&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus we have achieved invariance with respect to volume and length.  One can also show the same invariance with respect to surface area being less than 6(4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 96.  However, note that this probability assignment is not necessarily a "correct" one.  For the exact distribution of lengths, volume, or surface area will depend on how the "experiment" is conducted.  This probability assignment is very similar to the [[maximum entropy probability distribution|maximum entropy]] one, in that the frequency distribution corresponding to the above probability distribution is the most likely to be seen.  So, if one was to go to ''N'' people individually and simply say "make me a box somewhere between 3 and 5 cm, or a volume between 27 and 125 cm&amp;sup3;, or a surface area between 54 and 150 cm&amp;sup2;", then unless there is a systematic influence on how they make the boxes (e.g. they form a group, and choose one particular method of making boxes), about 56% of the boxes will be less than 4&amp;nbsp;cm - and it will get very close to this amount very quickly.  So, for large N, any deviation from this basically indicates the makers of the boxes were "systematic" in how the boxes were made.

The fundamental hypothesis of [[statistical physics]], that any two microstates of a system with the same total energy are equally probable at [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], is in a sense an example of the principle of indifference. However, when the microstates are described by continuous variables (such as positions and momenta), an additional physical basis is needed in order to explain under ''which'' parameterization the probability density will be uniform.  [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]] justifies the use of canonically conjugate variables, such as positions and their conjugate momenta.

==History of the principle of indifference==

The original writers on probability, primarily [[Jacob Bernoulli]] and [[Pierre Simon Laplace]], considered the principle of indifference to be intuitively obvious and did not even bother to give it a name.  Laplace wrote:

:The theory of chance consists in reducing all the events of the same kind to a certain number of cases equally possible, that is to say, to such as we may be equally undecided about in regard to their existence, and in determining the number of cases favorable to the event whose probability is sought. The ratio of this number to that of all the cases possible is the measure of this probability, which is thus simply a fraction whose numerator is the number of favorable cases and whose denominator is the number of all the cases possible.

These earlier writers, Laplace in particular, naively generalized the principle of indifference to the case of continuous parameters, giving the so-called "uniform prior probability distribution", a function which is constant over all real numbers. He used this function to express a complete lack of knowledge as to the value of a parameter.  According to Stigler (page 135), Laplace's assumption of uniform prior probabilities was not a meta-physical assumption.  It was an implicit assumption made for the ease of analysis.

The '''principle of insufficient reason''' was its first name, given to it by later writers, possibly as a play on [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[principle of sufficient reason]]. These later writers ([[George Boole]], [[John Venn]], and others) objected to the use of the uniform prior for two reasons. The first reason is that the constant function is not normalizable, and thus is not a proper probability distribution. The second reason is its inapplicability to continuous variables, as described above. (However, these paradoxical issues can be resolved. In the first case, a constant, or any more general finite polynomial, ''is'' normalizable within any finite range: the range [0,1] is all that matters here. Alternatively, the function may be modified to be zero outside that range, as with a [[continuous uniform distribution]]. In the second case, there is no ambiguity provided the problem is "well-posed", so that no unwarranted assumptions can be made, or have to be made, thereby fixing the appropriate prior [[probability density function]] or prior [[moment generating function]] (with variables fixed appropriately) to be used for the probability itself. See the [[Bertrand paradox (probability)]] for an analogous case.)

The "principle of insufficient reason" was renamed the "principle of Indifference" by the economist {{harvs|first=John Maynard|last=Keynes|authorlink=John Maynard Keynes|year=1921|txt}}, who was careful to note that it applies only when there is no knowledge indicating unequal probabilities.

Attempts to put the notion on firmer [[philosophy|philosophical]] ground have generally begun with the concept of [[equipossibility]] and progressed from it to [[equiprobability]].

The principle of indifference can be given a deeper logical justification by noting that equivalent states of knowledge should be assigned equivalent epistemic probabilities.  This argument was propounded by [[E.T. Jaynes]]:  it leads to two generalizations, namely the [[principle of transformation groups]] as in the [[Jeffreys prior]], and the [[principle of maximum entropy]].

More generally, one speaks of [[non-informative prior]]s.

The measures of the '''old Romanian system''' varied greatly not only between the three [[Romania|Romanian states]] ([[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]], [[Transylvania]]), but sometimes also inside the same country. The origin of some of the measures are the Latin (such as [[Jugerum|''iug&amp;#259;r'']] unit), Slavic (such as ''vadră'' unit), Greek (such as ''dram'' unit) and Turkish (such as ''palmac'' unit) systems.

This system is no longer in wide use since the adoption of the metric system in 1864, however some rural communities still use a small subset of these units.

==Length==
* ''Palmă'' (palm) -  1/8 of a ''stânjen''
* ''Stânjen'' -  2 m (approximately)
* ''Palmac'' -  3.48&amp;nbsp;cm (Moldavia)
* ''Poştă'' -  8&amp;ndash;20&amp;nbsp;km (depending on the country)
* ''Pas mic'' (small step) -  4 ''palme'' (Wallachia) (palme is the plural noun for palmă)
* ''Pas mare'' (large step) -  6 ''palme'' (Wallachia; Moldavia)
* ''Lat de palmă'' (palm width) -  1/2 ''palmă''
* ''Cot'' (cubit) -  664&amp;nbsp;mm (Moldavia); 637&amp;nbsp;mm (Wallachia)
* ''Funie'' (rope) -  20&amp;ndash;120 m (depending on the place)
* ''Leghe'' (league) -  4.444&amp;nbsp;km; 
* ''Deget'' (finger) -  the width of a finger
* ''Prăjină'' -  3 ''stânjeni'' (stânjeni is the plural noun for stânjen)
* ''Verstă'' -  1067 m (3,500&amp;nbsp;ft)
* ''Picior'' (foot) -  1/6 of a ''stânjen''

'''Self-propaganda''' is a form of [[propaganda]] and [[indoctrination]] performed by an [[individual]] or a [[Group (sociology)|group]] on oneself.

==Background==
Essentially, it is the act of telling one's self (or a group telling themselves) something that they consider to be true, or to convince themselves, with the unfortunate repercussion of their having no doubts. Because of what they do to themselves, they will go over every aspect of their side of the "argument" to prove to themselves that they are right, and will refuse to look at any alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JQE9rD5X0m4C&amp;lpg=PA242&amp;dq=%22self%20propaganda%22&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage&amp;q=%22self%20propaganda%22&amp;f=false Carey McWilliams (1999) ''A mask for privilege: anti-semitism in America''] 2 Ed. pp 242.

It hides behind partial truths and ignores questions of [[critical thought]].

'''Sovereignty''' is the full right and power of a governing body over itself, without any interference from outside sources or bodies. In political theory, sovereignty is a [[substantive]] term designating supreme [[authority]] over some [[polity]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|title=sovereignty (politics)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/557065/sovereignty |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a basic principle underlying the dominant [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian model]] of [[Sovereign state|state foundation]].

==Different approaches==

The concepts of sovereignty have been discussed throughout history, and are still actively debated.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Núñez|first1=Jorge Emilio|title=About the Impossibility of Absolute State Sovereignty|journal=International Journal for the Semiotics of Law|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11196-013-9333-x|doi=10.1007/s11196-013-9333-x|volume=27|pages=645–664}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Núñez|first1=Jorge Emilio|title=About the Impossibility of Absolute State Sovereignty: The Middle Ages|journal=International Journal for the Semiotics of Law|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11196-014-9379-4|doi=10.1007/s11196-014-9379-4|volume=28|pages=235–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its definition, concept, and application has changed throughout, especially during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The current notion of [[sovereign state|state sovereignty]] contains four aspects consisting of territory, population, authority and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biersteker|first1=Thomas|last2=Weber|first2=Cynthia |title=State Sovereignty as Social Construct|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qy97O2Eon0gC|series=Cambridge Studies in International Relations|volume=46|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|ISBN=9780521565998}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Stephen D. Krasner]], the term could also be understood in four different ways: 
* domestic sovereignty – actual control over a state exercised by an authority organized within this state,&lt;ref name=Krasner&gt;{{cite book|pages=6–12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISqwQIBQff4C&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;pg=PA7|title=Problematic Sovereignty: Contested Rules and Political Possibilities|isbn=9780231121798|author1=Krasner|first1=Professor Stephen D.|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* interdependence sovereignty – actual control of movement across state's borders, assuming the borders exist,&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt;
* international legal sovereignty – formal recognition by other sovereign states,&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt;
* [[Westphalian sovereignty]] – lack of other authority over state other than the domestic authority (examples of such other authorities could be a non-domestic church, a non-domestic political organization, or any other external agent).&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt;

Often, these four aspects all appear together, but this is not necessarily the case – they are not affected by one another, and there are historical examples of states that were non-sovereign in one aspect while at the same time being sovereign in another of these aspects.&lt;ref name=Krasner/&gt; According to [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], another fundamental feature of sovereignty is that it is a claim that must be recognised by others if it is to have any meaning: {{cquote|Sovereignty is more than anything else a matter of legitimacy [...that] requires reciprocal recognition. Sovereignty is a hypothetical trade, in which two potentially conflicting sides, respecting de facto realities of power, exchange such recognitions as their least costly strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallerstein|first=Immanuel|title=World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vGr7kRsXBkC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822334422|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==

===Classical===
The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] jurist [[Ulpian]] observed that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Or46AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=ulpian+sovereignty&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yLziOgc30p&amp;sig=M8UwaBN0HZMBwqfdmI3Cz9HBk3w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pE6kVJ6GEMe3oQSAq4L4Dg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ulpian%20sovereignty&amp;f=false|title=Sovereignty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The people transferred all their ''[[imperium]]'' and power to the [[Roman emperor|Emperor]]. Cum lege regia, quae de imperio eius lata est, populus ei et in eum omne suum imperium et potestatem conferat (Digest I.4.1)
* The emperor is not bound by the laws. Princeps legibus solutus est (Digest I.3.31)
* A decision by the emperor has the force of a statute. Quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem. (Digest I.4.1)

Ulpian was expressing the idea that the Emperor exercised a rather absolute form of sovereignty, that originated in the people, although he did not use the term expressly.

===Medieval===
Ulpian's statements were known in [[medieval Europe]], but sovereignty was an important concept in medieval times.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Medieval monarchs were ''not'' sovereign, at least not strongly so, because they were constrained by, and shared power with, their [[feudalism|feudal]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Furthermore, both were strongly constrained by custom.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Sovereignty existed during the Medieval period as the ''[[de jure]]'' rights of nobility and royalty, and in the ''de facto'' capability of individuals to make their own choices in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tititudorancea.com/z/sovereignty_07.htm|title=Sovereignty|website=www.tititudorancea.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around c. 1380–1400, the issue of feminine sovereignty was addressed in Geoffrey Chaucer's [[Middle English]] collection of ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', specifically in ''[[The Wife of Bath's Tale]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaucer's tale of the Wife of Bath.|url=http://www.dhushara.com/book/renewal/bath.htm|accessdate=10 January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221200100/http://www.dhushara.com/book/renewal/bath.htm|archivedate=21 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later English [[Arthurian]] romance, ''The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell'' (c. 1450),&lt;ref name="Sir-Gawaine"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell|url=http://www.lone-star.net/mall/literature/gawain.htm|accessdate=10 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses many of the same elements of the Wife of Bath's tale, yet changes the setting to the court of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. The story revolves around the knight [[Sir Gawain]] granting to Dame Ragnell, his new bride, what is purported to be wanted most by women: sovereignty.

{{quote|We desire most from men,&lt;br /&gt;
From men both lund and poor,&lt;br /&gt;
To have sovereignty without lies.&lt;br /&gt;
For where we have sovereignty, all is ours,&lt;br /&gt;
Though a knight be ever so fierce,&lt;br /&gt;
And ever win mastery.&lt;br /&gt;

Over such a sir.&lt;br /&gt;
Such is our purpose.|sign=The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnell (c. 1450)|source=&lt;ref name="Sir-Gawaine"/&gt;}}

===Reformation===

Sovereignty reemerged as a concept in the late 16th century, a time when civil wars had created a craving for stronger central authority, when monarchs had begun to gather power onto their own hands at the expense of the nobility, and the modern [[nation state]] was emerging. [[Jean Bodin]], partly in reaction to the chaos of the [[French wars of religion]], presented theories of sovereignty calling for strong central authority in the form of [[absolute monarchy]]. In his 1576 treatise ''[[Jean Bodin#Les Six livres de la R.C3.A9publique|Les Six Livres de la République]]'' ("Six Books of the Republic") Bodin argued that it is inherent in the nature of the [[State (politics)|state]] that sovereignty must be:&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

* Absolute: On this point he said that the sovereign must be hedged in with obligations and conditions, must be able to legislate without his (or its) subjects' consent, must not be bound by the laws of his predecessors, and could not, because it is illogical, be bound by his own laws.
* Perpetual: Not temporarily delegated as to a strong leader in an emergency or to a state employee such as a [[magistrate]]. He held that sovereignty must be perpetual because anyone with the power to enforce a time limit on the governing power must be above the governing power, which would be impossible if the governing power is absolute.

Bodin rejected the notion of transference of sovereignty from people to the ruler (also known as ''the sovereign''); natural law and divine law confer upon the sovereign the right to rule. And the sovereign is not above divine law or natural law. He is above (''ie.'' not bound by) only [[positive law]], that is, laws made by humans. He emphasized that a sovereign is bound to observe certain basic rules derived from the divine law, the law of nature or reason, and the law that is common to all nations (jus gentium), as well as the fundamental laws of the state that determine who is the sovereign, who succeeds to sovereignty, and what limits the sovereign power. Thus, Bodin’s sovereign was restricted by the constitutional law of the state and by the higher law that was considered as binding upon every human being.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; The fact that the sovereign must obey divine and natural law imposes ethical constraints on him. Bodin also held that the ''lois royales'', the fundamental laws of the French monarchy which regulated matters such as succession, are natural laws and are binding on the French sovereign.

Despite his commitment to absolutism, Bodin held some moderate opinions on how government should in practice be carried out. He held that although the sovereign is not obliged to, it is advisable for him, as a practical expedient, to convene a [[senate]] from whom he can obtain advice, to delegate some power to magistrates for the practical administration of the law, and to use the [[Estates of the realm|Estates]] as a means of communicating with the people.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Bodin believed that “the most divine, most excellent, and the state form most proper to royalty is governed partly aristocratically and partly democratically”.&lt;ref&gt;Bodin, Six livres, 6:254 (VI:vi).&lt;/ref&gt;

With his doctrine that sovereignty is conferred by divine law, Bodin predefined the scope of the [[divine right of kings]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
&lt;!--Bodin: "''Sovereignty is a Republic's absolute and perpetual power ''" Sovereignty is [[absolute]], thus indivisible, but not without any limits: it exercises itself only in the [[public]] sphere, not in the [[Private sector|private]] sphere. It is perpetual, because it does not expire with its holder (as ''auctoritas'' does). In other words, sovereignty is no one's property: by essence, it is inalienable. --&gt;

===Age of Enlightenment===
During the Age of Enlightenment, the idea of sovereignty gained both legal and moral force as the main Western description of the meaning and power of a State. In particular, the "[[Social contract]]" as a mechanism for establishing sovereignty was suggested and, by 1800, widely accepted, especially in the new [[United States]] and [[France]], though also in Great Britain to a lesser extent.

[[Thomas Hobbes]], in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (1651) arrived a conception of sovereignty similar to Bodin's, which had just achieved legal status in the "[[Peace of Westphalia]]", but for different reasons. He created the first modern version of the social contract (or contractarian) theory, arguing that to overcome the "nasty, brutish and short" quality of life without the cooperation of other human beings, people must join in a "commonwealth" and submit to a "Soveraigne{{sic}} Power" that is able to compel them to act in the common good. This expediency argument attracted many of the early proponents of sovereignty. Hobbes strengthened the definition of sovereignty beyond either Westphalian or Bodin's, by saying that it must be:{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

* Absolute: because conditions could only be imposed on a sovereign if there were some outside arbitrator to determine when he had violated them, in which case the sovereign would not be the final authority.
* Indivisible: The sovereign is the only final authority in his territory; he does not share final authority with any other entity. Hobbes held this to be true because otherwise there would be no way of resolving a disagreement between the multiple authorities.

Hobbes' hypothesis—that the ruler's sovereignty is contracted to him by the people in return for his maintaining their physical safety—led him to conclude that if and when the ruler fails, the people recover their ability to protect themselves by forming a new contract.

Hobbes's &lt;!--characteristics--&gt;theories decisively shape the concept of sovereignty through the medium of [[social contract]] theories. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s (1712–1778) definition of [[popular sovereignty]] (with early antecedents in [[Francisco Suárez]]'s theory of the origin of power), provides that the people are the legitimate sovereign. Rousseau considered sovereignty to be inalienable; he condemned the distinction between the origin and the exercise of sovereignty, a distinction upon which [[constitutional monarchy]] or [[representative democracy]] is founded. [[John Locke]], and [[Montesquieu]] are also key figures in the unfolding of the concept of sovereignty; their views differ with Rousseau and with Hobbes on this issue of alienability.

The second book of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ''[[Du Contrat Social, ou Principes du droit politique]]'' (1762) deals with sovereignty and its rights. Sovereignty, or the general will, is inalienable, for the will cannot be transmitted; it is indivisible, since it is essentially general; it is infallible and always right, determined and limited in its power by the common interest; it acts through laws. Law is the decision of the general will in regard to some object of common interest, but though the general will is always right and desires only good, its judgment is not always enlightened, and consequently does not always see wherein the common good lies; hence the necessity of the legislator. But the legislator has, of himself, no authority; he is only a guide who drafts and proposes laws, but the people alone (that is, the sovereign or general will) has authority to make and impose them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Contract|last=Rousseau|first=Jean-Jacques|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/rousseau1762.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau, in the Social Contract''&lt;ref&gt;''Social Contract'', Book II, Chapter III.
&lt;/ref&gt;
argued, "the growth of the State giving the trustees of public authority more and means to abuse their power, the more the Government has to have force to contain the people, the more force the Sovereign should have in turn in order to contain the Government," with the understanding that the Sovereign is "a collective being of wonder" (Book II, Chapter I) resulting from "the general will" of the people, and that "what any man, whoever he may be, orders on his own, is not a law" (Book II, Chapter VI) – and furthermore predicated on the assumption that the people have an unbiased means by which to ascertain the general will.  Thus the legal maxim, "there is no law without a sovereign."&lt;ref name="max-seydel"&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Gl9JAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=%22there+is+no+law+without+a+sovereign%22+Seydel | title = A society of states: Or, Sovereignty, independence, and equality in a league of nations | author1 = Stallybrass | first1 = William Teulon Swan | year = 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and types==
{{quote box|width=30%|There exists perhaps no conception the meaning of which is more controversial than that of sovereignty. It is an indisputable fact that this conception, from the moment when it was introduced into political science until the present day, has never had a meaning which was universally agreed upon.|[[Lassa Oppenheim]] (30-03-1858 – 07-10-1919)|an authority on international law&lt;ref&gt;[[Lassa Oppenheim]], International Law 66 (Sir Arnold D. McNair ed., 4th ed. 1928)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Absoluteness===
An important factor of sovereignty is its degree of [[Absolute monarchy|absoluteness]].&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A sovereign power has absolute sovereignty when it is not restricted by a constitution, by the laws of its predecessors, or by [[Custom (law)|custom]], and no areas of law or policy are reserved as being outside its control. [[International law]]; policies and actions of neighboring states; cooperation and respect of the populace; means of enforcement; and resources to enact policy are factors that might limit sovereignty. For example, parents are not guaranteed the right to decide some matters in the upbringing of their children independent of societal regulation, and municipalities do not have unlimited jurisdiction in local matters, thus neither parents nor municipalities have absolute sovereignty. Theorists have diverged over the desirability of increased absoluteness.

===Exclusivity===
A key element of sovereignty in a legalistic sense is that of exclusivity of [[jurisdiction]]. Specifically, the degree to which decisions made by a sovereign entity might be contradicted by another authority.  Along these lines, the German sociologist [[Max Weber]] proposed that sovereignty is a community's monopoly on the legitimate use of force; and thus any group claiming the same right must either be brought under the yoke of the sovereign, proven illegitimate, or otherwise contested and defeated for sovereignty to be genuine.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Kenneth. Foundations of comparative politics: democracies of the modern world. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; International law, competing branches of government, and authorities reserved for subordinate entities (such as [[federated state]]s or republics) represent legal infringements on exclusivity. Social institutions such as religious bodies, corporations, and competing political parties might represent ''de facto'' infringements on exclusivity.

===''De jure'' and ''de facto''===
''[[De jure]]'', or legal, sovereignty concerns the expressed and institutionally recognised right to exercise control over a territory. ''[[De facto]]'', or actual, sovereignty is concerned with whether control in fact exists. Cooperation and respect of the populace; control of resources in, or moved into, an area; means of enforcement and security; and ability to carry out various functions of state all represent measures of ''de facto'' sovereignty. When control is practiced predominantly by military or police force it is considered ''coercive sovereignty''.

====Sovereignty and independence====
{{refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
State sovereignty is sometimes viewed synonymously with [[independence]], however, sovereignty can be transferred as a legal right whereas independence cannot.&lt;ref name="talmon"/&gt; A state can achieve ''de facto'' independence long after acquiring sovereignty, such as in the case of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.&lt;ref name="talmon"/&gt; Additionally, independence can also be suspended when an entire region becomes subject to an occupation such as when [[Iraq]] had been overrun by the forces to take part in the [[Iraq War of 2003]], Iraq had not been annexed by any country, so its sovereignty during this period was not contested by any state including those present on the territory. Alternatively, independence can be lost completely when sovereignty itself becomes the subject of dispute. The pre-World War II administrations of [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Estonia]] maintained an exile existence (and considerable international recognition) whilst their territories were annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] and governed locally by their pro-Soviet functionaries. When in 1991 Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia re-enacted independence, it was done so on the basis of continuity directly from the pre-Soviet republics.&lt;ref name="talmon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Talmon|first=Stefan|title=Recognition of Governments in International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=scc8EboiJX8C&amp;pg=PA50|series=Oxford Monographs in International Law Series|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198265733|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mälksoo|first=Lauri|title=Illegal Annexation and State Continuity: The Case of the Incorporation of the Baltic States by the USSR|year=2003|publisher=M. Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9041121773|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5w6AQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another complicated sovereignty scenario can arise when regime itself is the subject of dispute. In the case of [[Poland]], the [[History of Poland (1945–89)|People's Republic of Poland]] which governed Poland from 1945 to 1989 is now seen to have been an illegal entity by the modern Polish administration. The post-1989 Polish state claims direct continuity from the [[Second Polish Republic]] which ended in 1939. For other reasons however, Poland maintains its communist-era outline as opposed to its pre-World War II shape which included areas now in [[Belarus]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Lithuania]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Ukraine]] but did not include some of its western regions that were then in [[Germany]].

At the opposite end of the scale, there is no dispute regarding the self-governance of certain self-proclaimed states such as [[Republic of Abkhazia]], [[Republic of South Ossetia]] or the [[Republic of Kosovo]] (see [[List of states with limited recognition]]) since their governments neither answer to a bigger state, nor is their governance subjected to supervision. The sovereignty (i.e. legal right to govern) however, is disputed in all three cases as the first two entities are claimed by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and the third by [[Serbia]].

===Internal===
Internal sovereignty is the relationship between a sovereign power and the political community. A central concern is [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]]: by what right does a government exercise authority? Claims of legitimacy might refer to the [[divine right of kings]] or to a [[social contract]] (i.e. [[popular sovereignty]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

With Sovereignty meaning holding supreme, independent authority over a region or state, Internal Sovereignty refers to the internal affairs of the state and the location of supreme power within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heywood|first=Andrew|title=Political Theory|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/51146058/41/Internal-sovereignty#page=108|work=pg. 92|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=25 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224011743/http://www.scribd.com/doc/51146058/41/Internal-sovereignty#page=108|archivedate=24 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A state that has internal sovereignty is one with a government that has been elected by the people and has the popular legitimacy.  Internal sovereignty examines the internal affairs of a state and how it operates.  It is important to have strong internal sovereignty in relation to keeping order and peace.  When you have weak internal sovereignty, organisations such as rebel groups will undermine the authority and disrupt the peace.  The presence of a strong authority allows you to keep agreement and enforce sanctions for the violation of laws.  The ability for leadership to prevent these violations is a key variable in determining internal sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolford,  Rider|first=Scott, Toby|title=War, Peace, and Internal Sovereignty|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~wolfordm/implementation2.pdf|work=pg.1|accessdate=19 June 2011}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lack of internal sovereignty can cause war in one of two ways: first, undermining the value of agreement by allowing costly violations; and second, requiring such large subsidies for implementation that they render war cheaper than peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolford, Rider|first=Scott, Toby|title=War, Peace, and Internal Sovereignty|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~wolfordm/implementation2.pdf|work=pg.3|accessdate=19 June 2011}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leadership needs to be able to promise members, especially those like armies, police forces, or paramilitaries will abide by agreements.  The presence of strong internal sovereignty allows a state to deter opposition groups in exchange for bargaining.  It has been said that a more decentralized authority would be more efficient in keeping peace because the deal must please not only the leadership but also the opposition group.  While the operations and affairs within a state are relative to the level of sovereignty within that state, there is still an argument between who should hold the authority in a sovereign state.

This argument between who should hold the authority within a sovereign state is called the traditional doctrine of public sovereignty.  This discussion is between an internal sovereign or an authority of public sovereignty.  An internal sovereign is a political body that possesses ultimate, final and independent authority; one whose decisions are binding upon all citizens, groups and institutions in society. Early thinkers believe sovereignty should be vested in the hands of a single person, a monarch.  They believed the overriding merit of vesting sovereignty in a single individual was that sovereignty would therefore be indivisible; it would be expressed in a single voice that could claim final authority.  An example of an internal sovereign or monarch is Louis XIV of France during the seventeenth century;  Louis XIV claimed that he was the state.  Jean-Jacques Rousseau rejected monarchical rule in favor of the other type of authority within a sovereign state, public sovereignty.  Public Sovereignty is the belief that ultimate authority is vested in the people themselves, expressed in the idea of the general will.  This means that the power is elected and supported by its members, the authority has a central goal of the good of the people in mind.  The idea of public sovereignty has often been the basis for modern democratic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heywood|first=Andrew|title=Political Theory|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/51146058/41/Internal-sovereignty#page=108|work=pg. 93|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=21 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224011743/http://www.scribd.com/doc/51146058/41/Internal-sovereignty#page=108|archivedate=24 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern internal sovereignty====

Within the modern governmental system, internal sovereignty is usually found in states that have public sovereignty and rarely found within a state controlled by an internal sovereign.  A form of government that is a little different from both is the UK parliament system.  From 1790 to 1859 it was argued that sovereignty in the UK was vested neither in the Crown nor in the people but in the "Monarch in Parliament".  This is the origin of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty and is usually seen as the fundamental principle of the British constitution.  With these principles of parliamentary sovereignty majority control can gain access to unlimited constitutional authority, creating what has been called "elective dictatorship" or "modern autocracy".  Public sovereignty in modern governments is a lot more common with examples like the USA, Canada, Australia and India where government is divided into different levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heywood|first=Andrew|title=Political Theory|work=pgs. 94–95|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|accessdate=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===External===
{{See also|Sovereign state#Recognition}}
External sovereignty concerns the relationship between a sovereign power and other states. For example, the [[United Kingdom]] uses the following criterion when deciding under what conditions other states recognise a political entity as having sovereignty over some territory;
{{quote box|width=30%|"Sovereignty." A government which exercises de facto administrative control over a country and is not subordinate to any other government in that country or a foreign sovereign state.|(''The Arantzazu Mendi'', [1939] A.C. 256)|Stroud's Judicial Dictionary}}

External sovereignty is connected with questions of international law – such as: when, if ever, is [[Foreign intervention|intervention]] by one country into another's territory permissible?

Following the [[Thirty Years' War]], a European religious conflict that embroiled much of the continent, the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 established the notion of territorial sovereignty as a norm of [[non-intervention|noninterference in the affairs of other nations]], so-called [[Westphalian sovereignty]], even though the actual treaty itself reaffirmed the multiple levels of sovereignty of the Holy Roman Empire. This resulted as a natural extension of the older principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (Whose realm, his religion), leaving the Roman Catholic Church with little ability to interfere with the internal affairs of many European states.  It is a myth, however, that the Treaties of Westphalia created a new European order of equal sovereign states.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Osiander, "Sovereignty, International Relations, and the Westphalian Myth", ''[[International Organization]]'' Vol. 55 No. 2 (Spring 2001), pp. 251–287.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[international law]], sovereignty means that a government possesses full control over affairs within a territorial or geographical area or limit. Determining whether a specific entity is sovereign is not an exact science, but often a matter of diplomatic dispute. There is usually an expectation that both ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' sovereignty rest in the same organisation at the place and time of concern. Foreign governments use varied criteria and political considerations when deciding whether or not to recognise the sovereignty of a state over a territory.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Membership in the [[United Nations]] requires that "[t]he admission of any such state to membership in the United Nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Chart, Article 2|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter2.shtml|accessdate=4 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208031716/https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter2.shtml|archivedate=8 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sovereignty may be recognized even when the sovereign body possesses no territory or its territory is under partial or total occupation by another power. The [[Holy See]] was in this position between the annexation in 1870 of the [[Papal States]] by Italy and the signing of the [[Lateran Treaties]] in 1929, a 59-year period during which it was recognised as sovereign by many (mostly Roman Catholic) states despite possessing no territory – a situation resolved when the Lateran Treaties granted the Holy See sovereignty over the [[Vatican City]]. Another case, ''[[sui generis]]'', {{Citation needed span|text=though often contested,|date=October 2012}} is the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], the third sovereign entity inside Italian territory (after [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City State]]) and the second inside the Italian capital (since in 1869 the Palazzo di Malta and the Villa Malta receive [[extraterritorial]] rights, in this way becoming the only "sovereign" territorial possessions of the modern Order), which is the last existing heir to one of several once militarily significant, [[crusader state]]s of sovereign [[Military order (society)|military order]]s. In 1607 its Grand masters were also made [[Reichsfürst]] (princes of the Holy Roman Empire) by the Holy Roman Emperor, granting them seats in the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]], at the time the closest permanent equivalent to a UN-type general assembly; confirmed 1620). These sovereign rights were never deposed, only the territories were lost. 100 modern states still maintain full diplomatic relations with the order&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orderofmalta.int/diplomatic-relations/862/sovereign-order-of-malta-bilateral-relations/?lang=en Bilateral diplomatic relations of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203180316/http://www.orderofmalta.int/diplomatic-relations/862/sovereign-order-of-malta-bilateral-relations/?lang=en |date=3 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (now ''de facto'' "the most prestigious service club"{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}), and the UN awarded it observer status.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES48265"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-48-265 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=48 |resolution_number=265 |accessdate=10 September 2007|title=Observer status for the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in the General Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[government-in-exile|governments-in-exile]] of many European states (for instance, Norway, Netherlands or [[Czechoslovakia]]) during the [[Second World War]] were regarded as sovereign despite their territories being under foreign occupation; their governance resumed as soon as the occupation had ended. The government of [[Kuwait]] was in a similar situation ''vis-à-vis'' the [[Iraq]]i occupation of its country during 1990–1991.&lt;ref name='nolan'&gt;{{cite book|last=Nolan|first=Cathal J.|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of International Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMJ8KP8i3v0C&amp;pg=PA1559|volume=Volume 4|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|page=1559}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The government of [[Republic of China]] was recognized as sovereign over [[Greater China|China]] from 1911 to 1971 despite that its [[mainland China]] territory became occupied by Communist Chinese forces since 1949. In 1971 it lost [[China and the United Nations|UN recognition]] to [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist]]-led People's Republic of China and its [[political status of Taiwan|sovereign and political status as a state became disputed]] and it lost its ability to use "China" as its name and therefore became commonly known as [[Taiwan]].

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross#Legal status|International Committee of the Red Cross]] is commonly mistaken to be sovereign. It has been granted various degrees of special privileges and legal [[Immunity from prosecution|immunities]] in many countries,{{Which|date=November 2010}} that in cases like Switzerland are considerable,&lt;ref&gt;By formal agreement between the Swiss government and the ICRC, Switzerland grants full sanctity of all ICRC property in Switzerland including its headquarters and archive, grants members and staff legal immunity, exempts the ICRC from all taxes and fees, guarantees the protected and duty-free transfer of goods, services, and money, provides the ICRC with secure communication privileges at the same level as foreign embassies, and simplifies Committee travel in and out of Switzerland.&lt;br&gt;On the other hand Switzerland [http://www.udiregelverk.no/~/media/Images/Rettskilder/Visa%20Code/Visa%20Code%20vedlegg%2010%20a.ashx does not recognize ICRC issued passports] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510112534/http://www.udiregelverk.no/~/media/Images/Rettskilder/Visa%20Code/Visa%20Code%20vedlegg%2010%20a.ashx |date=10 May 2011 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee is a private organisation governed by Swiss law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/who-we-are/overview-who-we-are.htm|title=About the International Committee of the Red Cross|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shared and pooled===
Just as the office of [[head of state]] can be vested jointly in several persons within a state, the sovereign jurisdiction over a single political territory can be shared jointly by two or more consenting powers, notably in the form of a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Likewise the member states of international organizations may voluntarily bind themselves by treaty to a supranational organization, such as a [[continental union]]. In the case of the [[Member state of the European Union#Sovereignty|European Union members states this is called "pooled sovereignty"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9248.00096/abstract|title=The European Union: Pooled Sovereignty, Divided Accountability | doi=10.1111/1467-9248.00096 | volume=45|journal=Political Studies|pages=559–578|first1=John|last1=Peterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McNaughton|first1=Neil|title=Understanding British and European political issues : a guide for A2 politics studies|date=2003|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0719062454|page=207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMrD6RRoZkQC&amp;pg=RA1-PT152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nation-states ===
A community of people who claim the right of [[self-determination]] based on a common ethnicity, history and culture might seek to establish sovereignty over a region, thus creating a [[nation-state]]. Such nations are sometimes recognised as [[autonomous area]]s rather than as fully sovereign, independent states.

===Federations===
In a [[federal republic|federal]] [[system of government]], ''sovereignty'' also refers to powers which a constituent state or republic possesses independently of the national government. In a [[confederation]] constituent entities retain the right to withdraw from the national body, but in a federation{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} member states or republics do not hold that right.{{dubious|date=March 2012}}

Different interpretations of [[states' rights|state sovereignty]] in the [[United States|United States of America]], as it related to the expansion of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[fugitive slave laws]], led to the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. Depending on the particular issue, sometimes both northern and southern states justified their political positions by appealing to state sovereignty. Fearing that slavery would be threatened by results of the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]], eleven slave states declared their independence from the federal Union and formed a new [[Confederate States of America|confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James M. McPherson|McPherson, James]], ''[[Battle Cry of Freedom (book)|Battle Cry of Freedom]]'', (1988) pp. 40, 195, 214, 241&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government rejected the [[secession in the United States|secessions]] as rebellion, declaring that secession from the Union by an individual state was [[unconstitutional]], as the states were part of an indissolvable federation. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Acquisition==
{{Main article|Acquisition of sovereignty}}

A number of modes of acquisition of sovereignty are presently or have historically been recognised by international law as lawful methods by which a state may acquire sovereignty over territory. The classification of these modes originally derived from Roman property law and from the 15th and 16th century with the development of international law. The modes are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malanczuk|first=Peter|title=Akehurst's Modern Introduction to International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4doebHRhGT8C&amp;pg=PA147|series=International politics/Public international law|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415111201|pages=147–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cession''' is the transfer of territory from one state to another usually by means of treaty;
* '''Occupation''' is the acquisition of territory that belongs to no state, or [[terra nullius]];
* '''Prescription''' is the effective control of territory of another acquiescing state;
* '''Operations of nature''' is the acquisition of territory through natural processes like river accretion or volcanism;
* '''Creation''' is the process by which new land is reclaimed from the sea such as in the Netherlands.
* '''Adjudication''' and
* '''Conquest'''

==Justifications==
There exist vastly differing views on the moral basis of sovereignty. A fundamental polarity is between theories that assert that sovereignty is vested directly in the sovereigns by divine or natural right and theories that assert it originates from the people. In the latter case there is a further division into those that assert that the people transfer their sovereignty to the sovereign (Hobbes), and those that assert that the people retain their sovereignty (Rousseau).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

During the brief period of [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]] in Europe, the [[divine right of kings]] was an important competing justification for the exercise of sovereignty. The [[Mandate of Heaven]] had some similar implications in China.

A republic is a form of government in which the people, or some significant portion of them, retain sovereignty over the government and where offices of state are not granted through heritage.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Republic|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Montesquieu]], ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748), Bk. II, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; A common modern definition of a republic is a government having a [[head of state]] who is not a monarch.&lt;ref name="WordNet"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=republic |journal=WordNet 3.0 |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=20 March 2009 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/republic |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Republic|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/republic|accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democracy is based on the concept of ''[[popular sovereignty]]''. In a [[direct democracy]] the public plays an active role in shaping and deciding policy. [[Representative democracy]] permits a transfer of the exercise of sovereignty from the people to a [[legislature|legislative body]] or an executive (or to some combination of legislature, executive and [[Judiciary]]). Many representative democracies provide limited direct democracy through [[referendum]], [[initiative]], and [[recall election|recall]].

[[Parliamentary sovereignty]] refers to a representative democracy where the parliament is ultimately sovereign and not the executive power nor the judiciary.

==Views==
* [[Classical liberalism|Classical liberals]] such as [[John Stuart Mill#Liberty|Stuart Mill]] consider every individual as sovereign.
* [[political Realism|Realists]] view sovereignty as being untouchable and as guaranteed to legitimate nation-states.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
* [[Rationalism (politics)|Rationalists]] see sovereignty similarly to realists. However, rationalism states that the sovereignty of a nation-state may be violated in extreme circumstances, such as human rights abuses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
* [[Internationalism (politics)|Internationalists]] believe that sovereignty is outdated and an unnecessary obstacle to achieving peace, in line with their belief of a 'global community'. In the light of the abuse of power by sovereign states such as Hitler's Germany or Stalin's Soviet Union, they argue that human beings are not necessarily protected by the state whose citizens they are, and that the respect for state sovereignty on which the UN Charter is founded is an obstacle to humanitarian intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Heuser: "Sovereignty, self-determination and security: new world orders in the 20th century", in Sohail Hashmi (ed.): ''State Sovereignty: Change and Persistence in International Relations'' (Philadelphia: Pennsylvania University Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anarchists and some [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] deny the sovereignty of states and governments. Anarchists often argue for a specific individual kind of sovereignty, such as the [[Anarch (sovereign individual)|Anarch as a sovereign individual]]. [[Salvador Dalí]], for instance, talked of "anarcho-monarchist" (as usual for him, tongue in cheek); [[Antonin Artaud]] of ''[[Elagabalus|Heliogabalus]]: Or, The Crowned Anarchist''; [[Max Stirner]] of ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]''; [[Georges Bataille]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] of a kind of "antisovereignty". Therefore, anarchists join a classical conception of the individual as sovereign of himself, which forms the basis of [[political consciousness]]. The unified consciousness is sovereignty over one's own body, as [[Nietzsche]] demonstrated (see also [[Pierre Klossowski]]'s book on ''Nietzsche and the Vicious Circle''). ''See also [[sovereignty of the individual]] and [[self-ownership]]''.
* [[Imperialism|Imperialists]] hold a view of sovereignty where power rightfully exists with those states that hold the greatest ability to impose the will of said state, by force or threat of force, over the populace of other states with weaker military or political will. They effectively deny the sovereignty of the individual in deference to either the 'good' of the whole, or to [[Divine right of kings|divine right]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

According to Matteo Laruffa "sovereignty resides in every public action and policy as the exercise of executive powers by institutions open to the participation of citizens to the decision-making processes"&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Laruffa, "The European Integration and National Interests: from an intergovernmental model to a Constitutional Agreement"(Hungarian Academy of Social Sciences, Budapest, 3 July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to rule of law==
Another topic is whether [[rule of law|the law is held to be sovereign]], that is, whether it is above political or other interference. Sovereign law constitutes a true state of law, meaning the [[letter of the law]] (if constitutionally correct) is applicable and enforceable, even when against the political will of the nation, as long as not formally changed following the constitutional procedure. Strictly speaking, any deviation from this principle constitutes a revolution or a coup d'état, regardless of the intentions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

{{political anthropology}}
'''State formation''' is the process of the development of a centralized government structure in a situation where one did not exist prior to its development.  State formation has been a study of many disciplines of the [[social science]]s for a number of years, so much so that Jonathan Haas writes that "One of the favorite pastimes of social scientists over the course of the past century has been to theorize about the evolution of the world's great civilizations."{{sfn|Haas|1982|p=1}} The study of state formation is divided generally into either the study of early states (those that developed in [[Stateless society|stateless societies]]) or the study of modern states (particularly of the form that developed in Europe in the 17th century and spread around the world). Academic debate about various theories is a prominent feature in fields like Anthropology, Sociology, Economics and Political Science.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=523}}

==The state==
{{main|State (polity)}}
A state is a political system with a centralized government, a military force, a civil service, an arranged society, and literacy. Though, there is no clear agreement on the defining characteristics of a state and the definition can vary significantly, based upon the focus of the particular definition.{{sfn|Haas|1982|pp=2-3}} The state is considered to be territoriality bound and is distinct from tribes or units without centralized institutions.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|pp=2-5}}

According to Painter &amp; Jeffrey, there are 5 distinctive features of the modern state:

1) They are ordered by precise boundaries with administrative control across the whole;

2) They occupy large territories with control given to organized institutions;

3) They have a capital city and are endowed with symbols that embody state power;

4) The government within state creates organizations to monitor, govern and control its population through surveillance and record keeping;

5) They increase monitoring over time.{{sfn|Painter|Jeffrey|2009|pp=22-24}}

Additionally, Herbst holds that there is another relevant characteristic of modern states: [[nationalism]]. This feeling of belonging to a certain territory plays a central role in state formation since it increases citizens' willingness to pay taxes.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}}

==Explaining early states and explaining modern states==
Theories of state formation have two distinct focuses, depending largely on the field of study:

# The early transition in human society from tribal communities into larger political organizations.  Studies of this topic, often in [[anthropology]], explore the initial development of basic administrative structures in areas where states developed from stateless societies.{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=129}} Although state formation was an active research agenda in anthropology and archaeology until the 1980s, some of the effort has changed to focus not on why these states formed but on how they operated.{{sfn|Marcus|Feinman|1998|p=3}} 
# In contrast, studies in [[political science]] and in [[sociology]] have focused significantly on the formation of the modern state.{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=131}}

States are minimally defined by anthropologist David S. Sandeford as socially stratified and bureaucratically governed societies with at least four levels of settlement hierarchy (e.g., a large capital, cities, villages, and hamlets). Primary states are those state societies that developed in regions where no states existed before. These states developed by strictly internal processes and interaction with other non-states societies.{{sfn|Sandeford|2018}} The exact number of cases which qualify as primary states is not clearly known because of limited information about political organization before the development of writing in many places,{{sfn|Wright|1977|p=386}} but Sandeford lists ten likely cases of primary state formation in Eurasia, the Americas, and the Pacific.{{sfn|Sandeford|2018}}

Studies on the formation of '''early states''' tend to focus on processes that create and institutionalize a state in a situation where a state did not exist before. Examples of early states which developed in interaction with other states include the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean Bronze Age Greek civilizations]] and the [[Malagasy culture#Madagascar|Malagasy civilization in Madagascar]].{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=306}} Unlike primary state formation, early state formation does not require the creation of the first state in that cultural context or development autonomously, independently from state development nearby. Early state formation causation can thus include borrowing, imposition, and other forms of interaction with already existing states.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=50}}

===Modern state formation===
Theories on the formation of modern states focus on the processes that support the development of modern states, particularly those that formed in late-medieval Europe and then spread around the world with colonialism. Starting in the 1940s and 1950s, with [[decolonization]] processes underway, attention began to focus on the formation and construction of modern states with significant bureaucracies, ability to tax, and territorial sovereignty around the world.{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=153}}{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=132}} However, some scholars hold that the modern state model formed in other parts of the world prior to colonialism, but that colonial structures replaced it.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=13}}

==Theories about early state development==
There are a number of different theories and hypotheses regarding early state formation that seek generalizations to explain why the state developed in some places but not others. Other scholars believe that generalizations are unhelpful and that each case of early state formation should be treated on its own.{{sfn|Spencer|Redmond|2004|p=174}}

===Voluntary theories===
[[File:City context.svg|thumb|right|Uruk one of the prime sites for research into early state formation]]
Voluntary theories contend that diverse groups of people came together to form states as a result of some shared rational interest.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}} The theories largely focus on the development of agriculture, and the population and organizational pressure that followed and resulted in state formation.  The argument is that such pressures result in integrative pressure for rational people to unify and create a state.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=21}} Much of the [[social contract]] philosophical tradition proposed a voluntary theory for state formation.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=21-23}}

One of the most prominent theories of early and primary state formation is the ''hydraulic hypothesis'', which contends that the state was a result of the need to build and maintain large-scale irrigation projects.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}} The theory was most significantly detailed [[Karl August Wittfogel]]'s argument that, in arid environments, farmers would be confronted by the production limits of small-scale irrigation. Eventually different agricultural producers would join together in response to population pressure and the arid environment, to create a state apparatus that could build and maintain large irrigation projects.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=734}}

In addition to this, is what Carneiro calls the ''automatic hypothesis'', which contends that the development of agriculture easily produces conditions necessary for the development of a state. With surplus food stocks created by agricultural development, creation of distinct worker classes and a division of labor would automatically trigger creation of the state form.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}}

A third voluntary hypothesis, particularly common with some explanations of early state development, is that long distance trade networks created an impetus for states to develop at key locations: such as ports or oases. For example, the increased trade in the 16th century may have been a key to state formation in West African states such as [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]], [[Dahomey]], and the [[Benin Empire]].{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}}

===Conflict theories===
Conflict theories of state formation regard conflict and dominance of some population over another population as key to the formation of states.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=734}} In contrast with voluntary theories, these arguments believe that people do not voluntarily agree to create a state to maximize benefits, but that states form due to some form of oppression by one group over others. A number of different theories rely on conflict, dominance, or oppression as a causal process or as a necessary mechanism within certain conditions and they may borrow from other approaches. In general the theories highlight: ''economic stratification'', ''conquest of other peoples'', conflict in ''circumscribed areas'', and the neoevolutionary growth of bureaucracy. 
[[File:Panorama of Monte Alban from the South Platform.jpg|thumb|center|650px|Panorama of Monte Albán in present-day Mexico, seen from the South Platform. Archeologists oftentimes look for evidence of such "large-scale construction projects, trade networks, and religious systems" to identify early states.{{sfn|Haas|1981|p=82}}]]

:*'''''Economic stratification'''''
:: [[Friedrich Engels]] articulated one of the earliest theories of the state based on anthropological evidence in ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' (1884).{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=6}} The theory of Engels developed from study of ''Ancient Society'' (1877) by [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and from the sketches of this work by [[Karl Marx]] on the [[Asiatic mode of production]].{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=25-26}} Engels argues that the state developed as a result of the need to protect private property. The theory contended that surplus production as a result of the development of agriculture created a division and specialization of labor: leading to classes who worked the land and to those who could devote time to other tasks. Class antagonism and the need to secure the private property of those living on the surplus production produced by agriculturalists resulted in the creation of the state.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=7}} The anthropologist [[Morton Fried]] (1923-1986) further developed this approach, positing social stratification as the primary dynamic underlying the development of the state.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=28-29}}

:*'''''Conquest theories'''''
:: Similar to the economic stratification theories, the conquest theory contends that a single city establishes a state in order to control other tribes or settlements it has conquered. The theory has its roots in the work of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1406) and of [[Jean Bodin]] (1530–1596), but it was first organized around anthropological evidence by [[Franz Oppenheimer]] (1864-1943).{{sfn|Service|1978|p=24}}{{sfn|Gross|1999|p=5}} Oppenheimer argues that the state was created to cement inequality between peoples that resulted from conquest.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=10}}

:*'''''Carneiro's circumscription theory'''''
[[File:Macchupicchu.jpg|thumb|right|The mountain [[Huayna Picchu]] overlooks the ruins of [[Machu Picchu]]. The [[Andes]] mountains circumscribed much of the region.]] 
:{{main|Carneiro's circumscription theory}}
::[[Robert Carneiro]] developed a theory (1970){{sfn|Carneiro|1970}} aiming to provide a more nuanced understanding of state formation by accounting for the fact that many factors (surplus agriculture, warfare, irrigation, conquest, etc.) did not produce states in all situations. He concluded that while population pressure and warfare were mechanisms of state formation, they only created states in geographic regions circumscribed, or walled off from the surrounding area.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=13}} Geographic barriers (or in some cases barriers created by nomadic raiders or by rival societies) create limitations on the ability of the people to deal with production shortfalls, and the result is that warfare results in state creation.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=28-29}} In situations of unlimited agricultural land (like the Amazon or the Eastern United States), Carneiro believes that the pressures did not exist and so warfare allowed people to move elsewhere and thus did not spur creation of a state.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|pp=734-735}}

:*'''''Neoevolutionary theories'''''
:{{further|Neoevolutionism}}
::A number of different theories, sometimes connected with some of the processes above, explain state formation in terms of the [[Sociocultural evolution|evolution]] of [[leadership]] systems. This argument sees human society as evolving from [[tribe]]s or [[chiefdom]]s into states through a gradual process of transformation that lets a small group hierarchically structure society and maintain order through appropriation of [[symbol]]s of power.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=8}} Groups that gained power in tribal society gradually worked towards building the hierarchy and segmentation that created the state.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=9}}

::[[Elman Service]] (1915-1996) proposed that, unlike in economic stratification theories, the state largely creates stratification in society rather than being created to defend that stratification.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=38}} Bureaucracy evolves to support the leadership structure in tribes and uses religious hierarchy and economic stratification as a means to further increase its power.{{sfn|Haas|1982|p=73}} Warfare may play a key role in the situation, because it allows leaders to distribute benefits in ways that serve their interests, however it is a constant that feeds the system rather than an autonomous factor.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=51}} Similarly, anthropologist [[Henry T. Wright]] argues (2006) that competitive and conflictual environments produce political experimentation leading to the development of the state. As opposed to theories that the state develops through chance or tinkering, experimentation involves a more directed process where tribal leaders learn from organization forms of the past and from the outcomes they produced.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=316}}

===Other theories===
Other aspects are highlighted in different theories as of contributing importance. It is sometimes claimed that technological development, religious development, or socialization of members are crucial to state development. However, most of these factors are found to be secondary in anthropological analysis.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|pp=61-68}} In addition to conquest, some theories contend that the need for defense from military conquest or the military organization to conquer other peoples is the key aspect leading to state formation.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}}

===Discredited theories===
Some theories proposed in the 19th century and early 20th century have since been largely discredited by anthropologists. Carneiro writes that theories "with a racial basis, for example, are now so thoroughly discredited that they need not be dealt with...We can also reject the belief that the state is an expression of the 'genius' of a people, or that it arose through a 'historical accident.' Such notions make the state appear to be something metaphysical or adventitious, and thus place it beyond scientific understanding."{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}} Similarly, [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] perspectives like those of [[Walter Bagehot]] in ''Physics and Politics'' argued that the state form developed as a result of the best leaders and organized societies gradually gaining power until a state resulted. Such explanations are not considered sufficient to explain the formation of the state.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=24}}{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=42}}

==Theories about modern state development==
In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] (500-1400) in Europe, there were a variety of authority forms throughout the region. These included feudal lords, empires, religious authorities, free cities, and other authorities.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527}} Often dated to the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], there began to be the development in Europe of modern states with large-scale capacity for taxation, coercive control of their populations, and advanced bureaucracies.{{sfn|Axtmann|2004|p=260}} The state became prominent in Europe over the next few centuries before the particular form of the state spread to the rest of the world via the colonial and international pressures of the 19th century and 20th century.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=535}} Other modern states developed in Africa and Asia prior to colonialism, but were largely displaced by colonial rule.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=12}}

Political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists began studying the state formation processes in Europe and elsewhere in the 17th century—beginning significantly with [[Max Weber]]. However, state formation became a primary interest in the 1970s. The question was often framed as a contest between state forces and society forces and the study of how the state became prominent over particular societies.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=525}} A number of theories developed regarding state development in Europe. Other theories focused on the creation of states in late colonial and post-colonial societies.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=530}}  The lessons from these studies of the formation of states in the modern period are often used in theories about [[State-building]]. Other theories contend that the state in Europe was constructed in connection with peoples from outside Europe and that focusing on state formation in Europe as a foundation for study silences the diverse history of state formation.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=8}}

Based on the model of European states, it has been commonly assumed that development is the natural path that states will eventually walk through. However, Herbst holds that in the case African states, as well as in developing countries of other regions, development need not be the natural step. States that struggle their consolidation could remain permanently weak.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}}

===Warfare theories===
[[File:Defenestration-prague-1618.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A woodcut of the [[Defenestrations of Prague]] in 1618—which began the [[Thirty Years' War]] and ended with the Peace of Westphalia that started the recognition of the modern state]]

Two related theories are based on military development and warfare, and the role that these forces played in state formation. [[Charles Tilly]] developed an argument that the state developed largely as a result of "state-makers" who sought to increase the taxes they could gain from the people under their control so they could continue fighting wars.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527}} According to Tilly, the state makes war and war makes states.{{sfn|Tilly|1985|p=170}} In the constant warfare of the centuries in Europe, coupled with expanded costs of war with mass armies and gunpowder, warlords had to find ways to finance war  and control territory more effectively. The modern state presented the opportunity for them to develop taxation structures, the coercive structure to implement that taxation, and finally the guarantee of protection from other states that could get much of the population to agree.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527-528}} Taxes and revenue raising have been repeatedly pointed out as a key aspect of state formation and the development of state capacity. Economist [[Nicholas Kaldor]] emphasized on the importance of revenue raising and warned about the dangers of the dependence on foreign aid.{{sfn|Kaldor|1963}} Tilly argues, state making is similar to organized crime because it is a "quintessential protection racket with the advantage of legitimacy."{{sfn|Tilly|1985|p=169}}

[[Michael Roberts (historian)|Michael Roberts]] and [[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]], in contrast, finds that the primary causal factor was not the "state-makers" themselves, but simply the military revolutions that allowed development of larger armies.{{sfn|Thompson|Rasler|1999|p=5}} The argument is that with the expanded state of warfare, the state became the only administrative unit that could endure in the constant warfare in the Europe of this period, because only it could develop large enough armies.{{sfn|Thompson|Rasler|1999|p=6}} 
This view—that the modern state replaced chaos and general violence with internal disciplinary structures—has been challenged as ethnocentric, and ignoring the violence of modern states.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=19}}

War has played a key role not only in the consolidation of European states but also of some third world states. According to Herbst, external security threats have had a fundamental role in the development of the [[South Korea]]n and [[Taiwan]]ese states.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}} A 2017 study which tests the predictions of warfare theories of Tilly and others found that the predictions do not match the empirical record.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The study found that median state size decreased from 1100 to 1800, and that the number of states increases rapidly between the twelfth and thirteen centuries and remained constant until 1800.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}}

===Commerce theories===
[[Stein Rokkan]] and others have argued that the modern territorial state developed in places that were peripheral to the commercial "city belt" ("a central regional band extending, roughly, in an arc from the Low Countries, through the Rhineland and into Northern Italy") that ran through Central Europe.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The existence of prosperous urban centers that relied on commerce in Central Europe prevented rulers from consolidaing their rule over others.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The elites in those urban centers could rely on their wealth and on collective security institutions (like the Hanseatic or Swabian league) with other urban centers to sustain their independence. A lower density of urban centers in England and France made it easier for rulers to establish rule over expansive territories.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}}

===Feudal crisis theories===
Another argument contends that the state developed out of economic and social crises that were prominent in late-medieval Europe. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants, and the involvement of leaders in the domains of other leaders under religious reasons was the primary problem dealt with in the Peace of Westphalia.{{sfn|Axtmann|2004|p=260}} In addition, Marxist theory contends that the economic crisis of feudalism forced the aristocracy to adapt various centralized forms of organization so they could retain economic power, and this resulted in the formation of the modern state.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=529}}

===Cultural theories===
Some scholarship, linked to wider debates in Anthropology, has increasingly emphasized the state as a primarily cultural artifact, and focuses on how symbolism plays a primary role in state formation.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=9}} Most explicitly, some studies emphasize how the creation of national identification and citizenship were crucial to state formation. The state then is not simply a military or economic authority, but also includes cultural components creating consent by people by giving them rights and shared belonging.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=530}}

===Outside Europe===
While modern states existed without European influence around the world before colonialism,{{sfn|Ejogu|2011|p=595}} post-colonial state formation has received the most significant attention.{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=155}} While warfare is primary in theories about state formation in Europe, the development of the international norm of [[non-interventionism]] means that other processes of state formation have become prominent outside Europe (including colonial imposition, assimilation, borrowing, and some internal political processes.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=531}}{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=155}} [[John W. Meyer|John W. Meyer's]] ''World Society Theory'' contends that the state form was exported from Europe, institutionalized in the United Nations, and gradually the modern nation-state became the basis for both those in power and those challenging power.{{sfn|Wimmer|Feinstein|2010|p=769}} In addition, because many of the early modern states like the United Kingdom and France had significant empires, their institutional templates became standard for application globally.{{sfn|Wimmer|Feinstein|2010|p=769}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6835">[[Image:George Berkeley by John Smibert.jpg|thumb|right|[[George Berkeley]] is credited with the development of subjective idealism.]]
'''Subjective idealism''', or '''empirical idealism''', is the [[Monism|monistic]] metaphysical doctrine that only minds and mental contents exist. It [[logical consequence|entails]] and is generally identified or associated with [[wikt:immaterialism|immaterialism]], the doctrine that material things do not exist. Subjective idealism rejects [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]], [[neutral monism]], and [[materialism]]; indeed, it is the contrary of [[eliminative materialism]], the doctrine that all or some classes of [[mind|mental]] [[phenomena]] (such as emotions, beliefs, or desires) do not exist, but are sheer [[illusion]]s.

==Overview==
Subjective idealism is a fusion of [[phenomenalism]] or empiricism, which confers special status upon the immediately perceived, with [[idealism]], which confers special status upon the mental. Idealism denies the knowability or existence of the non-mental, while phenomenalism serves to restrict the mental to the empirical. Subjective idealism thus identifies its mental reality with the world of ordinary experience, rather than appealing to the unitary world-spirit of [[pantheism]] or [[absolute idealism]]. This form of idealism is "subjective" not because it denies that there is an objective reality, but because it asserts that this reality is completely dependent upon the minds of the subjects that perceive it.

The earliest thinkers identifiable as subjective idealists were certain members of the [[Yogācāra]] school of Indian Buddhism, who reduced the world of experience to a stream of subjective perceptions. Subjective idealism made its mark in Europe in the 18th-century writings of [[George Berkeley]], who argued that the idea of mind-independent reality is incoherent, concluding that the world consists of the minds of humans and of God. Subsequent writers have continuously grappled with Berkeley's [[skepticism|skeptical]] arguments. [[Immanuel Kant]] responded by rejecting Berkeley's immaterialism and replacing it with [[transcendental idealism]], which views the mind-independent world as existent but incognizable [[noumenon|in itself]]. Since Kant, true immaterialism has remained a rarity, but is survived by partly overlapping movements such as phenomenalism, subjectivism, and [[perspectivism]].

==History==
Thinkers such as [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] anticipated idealism's antimaterialism with their views of the inferior or derivative reality of matter. However, these [[Platonism|Platonists]] did not make Berkeley's turn toward subjectivity. Indeed, Plato rationalistically condemned sense-experience, whereas subjective idealism presupposed [[empiricism]] and the irreducible reality of [[sense data]]. A more subjectivist methodology could be found in the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonists']] emphasis on the world of appearance, but their skepticism precluded the drawing of any [[ontology|ontological]] conclusions from the epistemic primacy of phenomena.

The first mature articulations of idealism arise in [[Yogacara|Yogacarin]] thinkers such as the 7th-century epistemologist [[Dharmakirti|Dharmakīrti]], who identified ultimate reality with sense-perception. The most famous proponent of subjective idealism in the Western world was the 18th-century [[Ireland|Irish]] philosopher [[George Berkeley]], although Berkeley's term for his theory was ''immaterialism''. From the point of view of subjective idealism, the material world does not exist, and the phenomenal world is dependent on humans. Hence the fundamental idea of this philosophical system (as represented by Berkeley or [[Ernst Mach|Mach]]) is that things are complexes of ideas or sensations, and only subjects and objects of perceptions exist. Berkeley summarized his theory with the motto "''esse est percipi''" ("To be is to be perceived"), but went on to elaborate it with God as the source of [[consensus reality]] and other particulars.

According to Berkeley, an object has real being as long as it is perceived by a mind. God, being omniscient perceives everything perceivable, thus all real beings exist in the mind of God. However, it is also evident that each of us has free will and understanding upon self-reflection, and our senses and ideas suggest that other people also possess these qualities as well. According to Berkeley there is no material universe, in fact he has absolutely no idea what that could possibly mean. To theorize about a universe that is composed of insensible matter is not a sensible thing to do. This matters because there is absolutely no positive account for a material universe, only speculation about things that are by fiat outside of our minds.

Berkeley's assessment of immaterialism was criticized by [[Samuel Johnson]], as recorded by [[James Boswell]].  Responding to the theory, Dr. Johnson exclaimed "I refute it ''thus''!" while kicking a rock with "mighty force".  This episode is alluded to by Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce's ''Ulysses'', chapter three. Reflecting on the "ineluctable modality of the visible", Dedalus conjures the image of Johnson's refutation and carries it forth in conjunction with Aristotle's expositions on the nature of the senses as described in ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Aristotle)|Sense and Sensibilia]]''.  Aristotle held that while visual perception suffered a compromised authenticity because it passed through the diaphanous liquid of the inner eye before being observed, sound and the experience of hearing were not thus similarly diluted. Dedalus experiments with the concept in the development of his aesthetic ideal.

==In fiction==
{{see also|Solipsism}}

Subjective idealism is featured prominently in the Norwegian novel ''[[Sophie's World]]'', in which "Sophie's world" exists in fact only in the pages of a book.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;!-- needs reliable source that what is presented in that book is actually subjective idealism --&gt;

A parable of subjective idealism can be found in [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' short story ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', which specifically mentions Berkeley.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2810">In [[type theory]], a '''type rule''' is an [[inference rule]] that describes how a [[type system]] assigns a type to a syntactic construction. These rules may be applied by the type system to determine if a [[Computer program|program]] is well typed and what type [[Expression (computer science)|expression]]s have.  A prototypical example of the use of type rules is in defining [[type inference]] in the [[simply typed lambda calculus]], which is the [[internal language]] of [[Cartesian closed categories]].

== Notation ==
 &lt;!-- historical reference (what it the paper by Luca Cardelli that introduce this notation?) --&gt;
An expression &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;e\!:\!\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[typing environment]] is written as &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. The notation for inference is the usual one for [[sequent]]s and [[inference rule]]s, and has the following general form

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Gamma_1 \vdash e_1\!:\!\tau_1 \quad \cdots \quad \Gamma_n \vdash e_n\!:\!\tau_n}{\Gamma \vdash e\!:\!\tau}
&lt;/math&gt;

The sequents above the line are the premises that must be fulfilled for the rule to be applied, yielding the conclusion: the sequents below the line. This can be read as: ''if expression &lt;math&gt;e_i&lt;/math&gt; has type &lt;math&gt;\tau_i&lt;/math&gt; in [[Typing environment|environment]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_i&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;i=1..n&lt;/math&gt;, then the expression &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; will have an environment &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and type &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;''.

For example, a simple language to perform arithmetic calculations on real numbers may have the following rules

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Gamma \vdash e_1\!:\!real \quad \Gamma \vdash e_2\!:\!real}{\Gamma \vdash e_1+e_2\!:\!real}
\qquad \frac{\Gamma \vdash e_1\!:\!integer \quad \Gamma \vdash e_2 : integer}{\Gamma \vdash e_1+e_2\!:\!integer} \qquad \cdots
&lt;/math&gt;

A type rule may have no premises, and usually the line is omitted in these cases. A type rule may also change an environment by adding new variables to a previous environment; for example, a declaration may have the following type rule, where a new variable &lt;math&gt;id&lt;/math&gt;,
with type &lt;math&gt;\tau'&lt;/math&gt;, is added to &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\Gamma \vdash e'\!:\!\tau' \quad \Gamma, id\!:\!\tau' \vdash e\!:\!\tau}{\Gamma \vdash \text{let id = } e' \text{ in } e \text{ end} :\!\tau}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the syntax of the let expression is that of [[Standard ML]]. Thus type rules can be used to derive the types of composed expressions, much like in [[natural deduction]].

'''Why–because analysis''' ('''WBA''') is a method for [[accident analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|date= April 1998|series=Spring Symposion|publisher=[[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]]|title=Analysing Aviation Accidents Using WB-Analysis - an Application of Multimodal Reasoning|url=http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/1998/SS-98-04/SS98-04-031.pdf|first1=Peter|last1=Ladkin|first2=Karsten|last2=Loer}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is independent of application domain and has been used to analyse, among others, aviation-, railway-, marine-, and computer-related accidents and incidents. It is mainly used as an after the fact (or [[a posteriori]]) analysis method.  WBA strives to ensure objectivity, [[falsifiability]] and reproducibility of results.

The result of a WBA is a '''why–because graph''' ('''WBG'''). The WBG depicts [[causal relation]]s between factors of an accident. It is a [[directed acyclic graph]] where the nodes of the graph are factors. Directed edges denote  [[Causality|cause–effect]] [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] between the factors.

== WBA in detail ==

WBA starts with the question "What is the accident or accidents in question?". In most cases this is easy to define. Next comes an iterative process to determine causes. When causes for the accident have been identified, formal tests are applied to all potential cause-effect relations. This process can be iterated for the newfound causes, and so on, until a satisfactory result has been achieved.

At each node (factor), each contributing cause (related factor) must have been [[Necessity and sufficiency|necessary]] to cause the accident, and the totality of causes must have been [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]] to do so.

== The formal tests ==

The ''counterfactual test'' (CT) – The CT leads back to [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]]' formal notion of causality and [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactuals]]. The CT asks the following question: "If the cause had not been, could the effect have happened?". The CT proves or disproves that a cause is a necessary causal factor for an effect. Only if it is necessary for the cause in question then it is clearly contributing to the effect.

The ''causal sufficiency test'' – The CST asks the question: "Will an effect always happen if all attributed causes happen?". The CST aims at deciding whether a set of causes are sufficient for an effect to happen. The missing of causes can thus be identified.

Only if for all causal relations the CT is positive and for all sets of causes to their effects the CST is positive the WBG is correct: each cause must be necessary (CT), and the totality of causes must be sufficient (CST): nothing is omitted (CST: the listed causes are sufficient), and nothing is superfluous (CT: each cause is necessary).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11425">'''Woese's dogma''' is a principle of [[evolutionary biology]] first put forth by biophysicist [[Carl Woese]] in 1977. It states that the evolution of [[ribosomal RNA]] was a necessary precursor to the evolution of modern life forms.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book| title=Dictionary of Theories| year=2002| page=557| last=Bothamley| first=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the advancement of the phylogenetic tree of life consisting of three domains rather than the previously accepted two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woese|first1=Carl R.|last2=Fox|first2=George E.|title=Phylogenetic structure of the prokaryotic domain: The primary kingdoms|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=1977|volume=74|issue=11|pages=5088–5090|bibcode=1977PNAS...74.5088W|doi=10.1073/pnas.74.11.5088|pmid=270744|pmc=432104}}&lt;/ref&gt;While the existence of [[Eukarya]] and [[Prokarya]] were already accepted, Woese was responsible for the distinction between [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koonin|first=Eugene V|date=2014-01-16|title=Carl Woese's vision of cellular evolution and the domains of life|journal=RNA Biology|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=197–204|doi=10.4161/rna.27673|issn=1547-6286|pmc=4008548|pmid=24572480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite initial criticism and controversy surrounding his claims, Woese's three domain system, based on his work regarding the role of rRNA in the evolution of modern life, has become widely accepted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morell|first=Virginia|date=1997-05-02|title=Microbial Biology: Microbiology's Scarred Revolutionary|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/276/5313/699|journal=Science|language=en|volume=276|issue=5313|pages=699–702|doi=10.1126/science.276.5313.699|issn=0036-8075|pmid=9157549}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Homology as Evidence for Woese's Dogma ==

=== tRNA Homology ===
Evidence for Woese's dogma is well established through comparisons of RNA [[Homology (biology)|homology]]. Modern research allows more liberal use of [[RNA-Seq|RNA sequencing]], allowing for a better comparative analysis between distant RNA. When analyzing multiple strains of [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']], Root-Bernstein et. al. have compared [[Transfer RNA|tRNA]] encodings found within rRNA with tRNA found in ''E. coli'' to see if the secondary structure was the same as more “modern” tRNA present in ''E. coli''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Comparisons between the tRNA encodings found in the rRNAs and [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the control sequences found that “sortings” for these sequences were extremely similar, and comparisons of translated protein structure indicated that homology was likely&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Root-Bernstein|first=Meredith|last2=Root-Bernstein|first2=Robert|date=February 2015|title=The ribosome as a missing link in the evolution of life|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.11.025|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=367|pages=130–158|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.11.025|issn=0022-5193}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, sequences homologous to all tRNAs necessary for translation were present in 16s and 23s rRNAs, and synthetases to load these tRNAs were also found, indicating that many of the functions of transcription and translation present in more modern life exist in rRNA, if vestigially&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.


=== rRNA Homology ===
When comparing homologies of rRNA structures, it is necessary to analyze substructures. This is because models that study RNA structure on the whole do not currently exist&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caetano-Anolles|first=G.|date=2002-06-01|title=Tracing the evolution of RNA structure in ribosomes|url=https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/30/11/2575/1024880|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|language=en|volume=30|issue=11|pages=2575–2587|doi=10.1093/nar/30.11.2575|issn=1362-4962}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Generally, [[Phylogenetics|phylogenies]] of rRNA subunits are created to understand each component, and how they function and evolve. Through phylogenies created that depict rRNA structural elements that are present in all three domains of life, the oldest structural components can be determined through [[relative dating]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harish|first=Ajith|last2=Caetano-Anollés|first2=Gustavo|date=2012-03-12|title=Ribosomal History Reveals Origins of Modern Protein Synthesis|url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0032776|journal=PLoS ONE|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=e32776|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032776|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3299690|pmid=22427882}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These phylogenies were used in a study by Harish et. al., to show that a helical stem labeled h44 in small subunit rRNA can be described as the oldest structural component of rRNA, which holds particular significance, as this structure responsible for linking processes in the small subunit, which is responsible for decoding, with the large subunit, which is responsible for the formation of peptide bonds and the releasing of elongation factors&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. This essentially shows that the functional origin of the ribosome, responsible for protein synthesis, is common in all modern life throughout each of the three domains.

Evidence has also been obtained in studying eukaryotic organelles, such as the chloroplast. Zablen et al.’s phylogenetic analysis conducted electrophoresis on chloroplast ribosomal RNA, specifically on the 16S rRNA of ''[[Euglena gracilis]]''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zablen|first=L. B.|last2=Kissil|first2=M. S.|last3=Woese|first3=C. R.|last4=Buetow|first4=D. E.|date=June 1975|title=Phylogenetic origin of the chloroplast and prokaryotic nature of its ribosomal RNA|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/806081|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=72|issue=6|pages=2418–2422|issn=0027-8424|pmid=806081}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' In conducting this experiment, researchers compared the electrophoretic fingerprint of this RNA to other chloroplasts and prokarya. In comparing these results, it was found that generally, these chloroplasts show a close genomic relationship, while a more distant one is seen for algae, and subsequently prokaryotic organisms&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. This experiment shows that the rRNA of distantly related organisms has a similar origin of that in eukaryotic organelles, supporting the idea that the evolution of rRNA was a necessary precursor of modern life.

== Ribosomes as Primordial Self-Replicating Entities ==
One of the reasons that Woese’s Dogma holds significance is because of the potential that RNA was the first primordial self-replicating molecule (see: [[RNA world|RNA World]]), meaning it would be  key in the progression of modern life&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bloch|first=David P.|last2=McArthur|first2=Barbara|last3=Mirrop|first3=Sam|date=January 1985|title=tRNA-rRNA sequence homologies: Evidence for an ancient modular format shared by tRNAs and rRNAs|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0303264785900759|journal=Biosystems|volume=17|issue=3|pages=209–225|doi=10.1016/0303-2647(85)90075-9|issn=0303-2647}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In particular, it has been proposed that ribosomes exist as a missing link in prebiotic evolution, with rRNA being a vestige of an ancient genome&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Some evidence exists for the proposal that rRNA functioned in the past to encode proteins that are key to ribosome function&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Root-Bernstein|first=Robert|last2=Root-Bernstein|first2=Meredith|date=May 2016|title=The ribosome as a missing link in prebiotic evolution II: Ribosomes encode ribosomal proteins that bind to common regions of their own mRNAs and rRNAs|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.02.030|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=397|pages=115–127|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.02.030|issn=0022-5193}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One notable example is the fact that rRNA proteins are commonly known to bind with their own mRNA&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. In addition, some ribosomal proteins not only regulate their own expression, but the expression of other proteins as well&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matelska|first=Dorota|last2=Purta|first2=Elzbieta|last3=Panek|first3=Sylwia|last4=Boniecki|first4=Michal J.|last5=Bujnicki|first5=Janusz M.|last6=Dunin-Horkawicz|first6=Stanislaw|date=2013-10-01|title=S6:S18 ribosomal protein complex interacts with a structural motif present in its own mRNA|url=http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/19/10/1341|journal=RNA|language=en|volume=19|issue=10|pages=1341–1348|doi=10.1261/rna.038794.113|issn=1355-8382|pmc=3854524|pmid=23980204}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These are both indications of self-replication, and indicate the possibility that the mRNA that encodes ribosomal proteins evolved from rRNA&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

=== Criticisms Regarding Primordial rRNA ===
RNA existing as a primordial self replicating entity is an idea that faces criticism. The idea of rRNA in particular being sufficient on its own to explain the progression of modern life struggles due to the fact that it lacks certain key pieces of evidence. In particular RNA cannot be shown to be prebiotic, as there is no way for the nucleotides or nucleosides that compose it to be non-enzymatically replicated&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Kevin E.|last2=Levy|first2=Matthew|last3=Miller|first3=Stanley L.|date=2000-04-11|title=Peptide nucleic acids rather than RNA may have been the first genetic molecule|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/97/8/3868|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=97|issue=8|pages=3868–3871|doi=10.1073/pnas.97.8.3868|issn=0027-8424|pmid=10760258}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Violence against women}}

A '''women's shelter''', also known as a '''women's refuge''' and '''battered women's shelter''', is a place of temporary protection and support for women escaping [[domestic violence]] and [[intimate partner violence]] of all forms.&lt;ref name="Definition"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/women-s-refuge|title=women's refuge Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also frequently used to describe a location for the same purpose that is open to people of all genders at risk.

Representative data samples done by the [[National Center for Injury Prevention and Control|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] show that one in three women will experience physical violence during their lifetime.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Breiding MJ, Chen J, Black MC. Intimate Partner Violence in the United States – 2010. Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; One in ten will experience sexual violence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Women's shelters help individuals escape these instances of domestic violence and intimate partner violence and act as a place for protection as they choose how to move forward. Additionally, many shelters offer a variety of other services to help women and their children including [[counseling]] and legal guidance.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam"&gt;Chanmugam, A. (2011). Perspectives on US Domestic Violence Emergency Shelters: What do Young Adolescent Residents and their Mothers Say?. ''Child Care In Practice'', ''17''(4), 395. doi:10.1080/13575279.2011.596814&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to escape is valuable for women subjected to domestic violence or intimate partner violence.  Additionally, such situations frequently involve an imbalance of power that limits the victim's financial options when they want to leave.&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009" /&gt; Shelters help women gain tangible resources to help them and their families create a new life.&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;Perez, S., Johnson, D. M., &amp; Wright, C. V. (2012). The Attenuating Effect of Empowerment on IPV-Related PTSD Symptoms in Battered Women Living in Domestic Violence Shelters. ''Violence Against Women'', ''18''(1), 102–117 16p. doi:10.1177/1077801212437348&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, shelters are valuable to [[battered women]] because they can help them find a sense of empowerment.&lt;ref name="Perez" /&gt;

Women's shelters are available in more than forty-five countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gnws.org/docs/GNWS_GlobalDataCount_2012.pdf|title=Global Data Count|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Global Network of Women's Shelters|access-date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are supported with government resources as well as non-profit funds. Additionally, many philanthropists also help and support these institutions.

==History==

=== Canada ===
The very first women's shelter in Canada was started in 1965 by the Harbour Rescue Mission (now Mission Services) in Hamilton, Ontario. It was named Inasmuch House, with the name referencing a Bible verse (Matthew 25:40) quoting Jesus Christ as saying "Inasmuch as you have done it for the least of these, you have done it for me." It was designed to be a practical outworking of Christian values relating to justice and care. Although originally conceived as a shelter for women leaving prison, its clientele later became women escaping abuse by their partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mission-services.com/say-hello/history/|title=History - Mission Services of Hamilton|work=Mission Services of Hamilton|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Inasmuch House was shared with other Christian inner-city missions across North America and led to the opening of  other such shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shelterlistings.org/details/19550/|title=The Haven Of Rest Ministries - Inasmuch House (for Women And Children)|website=www.shelterlistings.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first  shelters in Canada developed from a feminist perspective were started by Interval House, Toronto in April 1973, and the Ishtar Transition Housing Society in Langley, B.C.in June 1973.  These homes were grass roots organizations that lived on short term grants at first, with staff often working sacrificially in order to keep the houses running to ensure women's safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ckc.torontofoundation.ca/org/interval-house-0|title=Interval House {{!}} Toronto Community Knowledge Centre|website=ckc.torontofoundation.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ishtarsociety.org/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

From there,the  movement in Canada grew, with women's shelters opening under a variety of names - often as a Transition House or Interval House - opening up across the country in order to help women flee from abusive situations.

=== United States ===
The first women's shelter in the United States was likely established in St. Paul, Minnesota shortly after the first domestic violence hotline was established in the same location.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt; However, other early locations include [[Rosie's Place]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], which was opened in 1974 by [[Kip Tiernan]], and the Atlanta Union Mission in Atlanta, opened by Elsie Huck.&lt;ref name="Detweiler2005"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7WP3g2h3vwC&amp;dq=Elsie+Huck&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=A Life of Faith: My Journey|last=Detweiler|first=Elsie Moses Huck|date=December 2005|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-37582-0|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's shelters evolved over time. Grassroots community advocates in the 1970s offered shelters as one of the first services for victims of intimate partner violence.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt; At this time, most shelters were for emergencies and involved stays less than six months.&lt;ref name="Montgomery"&gt;Montgomery, B. E., Rompalo, A., Hughes, J., Wang, J., Haley, D., Soto-Torres, L., &amp; ... Hodder, S. (2015). Violence Against Women in Selected Areas of the United States. ''American Journal of Public Health'', ''105''(10), 2156–2166. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2014.302430&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers and shelter workers offered legal and welfare referrals to women when they exited but contact afterwards was limited. More recent programs, such as those funded by the [[Violence Against Women Act]], offer longer term stays for women.&lt;ref name="Montgomery" /&gt; These locations, as well as [[transitional housing]], offer more services to women and their children.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Roberts, A. R., &amp; Lewis, S. J. (2000). Giving them shelter: National organizational survey of shelters for battered women and their children. ''Journal of Community Psychology'', ''28''(6), 669–681.&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent change is the increasing amount of shelters publicizing their locations to increase funding and visibility in the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to a larger women's movement, the number of shelters quickly increased after their induction and by 1977 the United States had eighty-nine shelters available for victims of violence.&lt;ref name="Clevenger"&gt;Clevenger, B. M., &amp; Roe-Sepowitz, D. (2009). Shelter Service Utilization of Domestic Violence Victims. ''Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment'', ''19''(4), 361. doi:10.1080/10911350902787429&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, the United States had over 2,000 domestic violence programs in place, many with domestic violence shelters included.&lt;ref name="Clevenger" /&gt;

=== Asia ===
For Asia, offering shelter to abused women is not a new concept. In feudal [[Japan]], [[Buddhist]] temples known as Kakekomi Dera acted as locations where abused women could take shelter before filing for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Cassegård, C. (2013). ''Youth Movements, Trauma and Alternative Space in Contemporary Japan''. Leiden: Brill, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; A formal system took more time, however, so it was not until 1993 that the grassroots women's movement of Japan built the first shelter.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Yoshihama, M. (2002). Breaking the web of abuse and silence: voices of battered women in Japan. ''Social Work'', ''47''(4), 389–400 12p. doi:sw/47.4.389&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there are thirty shelters throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A similar history did not lead to as much progress in [[China]].  Women's shelters did not exist until the nineties and since then the country only opened a small number.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Joan|date=2012-07-01|title=The Global Women's Movement and Chinese Women's Rights|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10670564.2012.666830|journal=Journal of Contemporary China|volume=21|issue=76|pages=585–602|doi=10.1080/10670564.2012.666830|issn=1067-0564}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Beijing]] there are no shelters for the twenty million residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/battered-women-in-china-could-finally-get-a-measure-of-legal-protection/2015/03/05/31e542c4-c1a8-11e4-a188-8e4971d37a8d_story.html|title=Battered women in China could finally get a measure of legal protection|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
In England, [[Erin Pizzey]] opened the first widely known shelter for battered women, [[Chiswick Women's Aid]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="Perez" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clevenger" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tierney|first=Kathleen|title=The Battered Women Movement and the Creation of the Wife Beating Problem|journal=Social Problems|date=February 1982|volume=29|issue=3|pages=207–220|jstor=800155|doi=10.1525/sp.1982.29.3.03a00010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this time almost every European country has opened shelters to help domestic violence victims.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fileserver.wave-network.org/researchreports/WAVE_Report_2015.pdf|title=WAVE Report 2015|last=Logar|first=Rosa|date=1 January 2016|website=|publisher=WAVE – Women against Violence Europe, Bacherplatz 10/6, A-1050 Vienna|access-date=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two countries even offer shelters for particular ethnicities and cultures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, a new development in Europe is that countries like the Netherlands and Austria opened social housing for long term stays.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One reason for this growth is the Istanbul Convention against Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence, a convention signed by forty-seven [[Council of Europe]] member states in 2011.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/istanbul-convention/home|title=Home|website=Istanbul Convention&lt;br /&gt;Action against violence against women and domestic violence|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the Convention sets the creation of women's shelters as a minimum standard for compliance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Following [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity]] two thirds of local authorities in England have cut funding for women's refuges since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/23/council-funding-womens-refuges-cut-since-2010-england-wales-scotland Council funding for women's refuges cut by nearly £7m since 2010] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the first women's refuge, known as [[Elsie Refuge]], was opened in [[Glebe, New South Wales]] in 1974 by a group of women's liberation activists. Many others followed, with 11 established around the country by the middle of 1975 and many more to follow. Initially these services were entirely reliant on volunteer efforts and donations from the community, but they subsequently secured government funding under the [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/forty_years_of_the_elsie_refuge_for_women_and_children|title=Forty years of the Elsie Refuge for Women and Children {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, government policy has recently seen some moves to dismantle the women's refuge movement, so that in New South Wales since 2014 the management of many refuges has been handed over to large religious agencies so that they now often operate as generic homeless services rather than specifically catering to women and children escaping domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newmatilda.com/2015/03/23/regional-womens-refuges-are-being-ripped-apart/|title=Regional Women's Refuges Are Being Ripped Apart|date=2015-03-23|website=New Matilda|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/womens-refuges-closing-down-after-reform-fails-them-20140618-zse72.html|title=Women's refuges closing down after reform fails them|last=Browne|first=Rachel|date=2014-06-21|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-07-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==

=== General purpose ===
Women's shelters offer temporary refuge for women escaping acts of [[domestic violence]] or [[intimate partner violence]]. Many women become homeless in this situation because they are financially dependent on their abuser and these resources help to incentivize and support escape.&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009"&gt;McNulty, M., Crowe, T., Kroening, C., VanLeit, B., &amp; Good, R. (2009). Time use of women with children living in an emergency homeless shelter for survivors of domestic violence. ''OTJR: Occupation, Participation &amp; Health'', ''29''(4), 183 8p.&lt;/ref&gt; The average length of stay for women is between thirty and sixty days in the United States.&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009"/&gt; However, this varies in different countries and in Europe, for example, four countries limit stays to a few weeks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Transitional housing]], another form of women's shelter, offers stays of up to a year while certain communities offer public and private housing for even longer periods.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt;

=== Utilization ===
There is high demand for shelter services in the United States. A one-day national census done by the [[National Network to End Domestic Violence]] found that emergency shelters served over 66,581 people in one day and over 9,000 requests could not be met during the same period.&lt;ref name="Dutton"&gt;Dutton, M. A., James, L., Langhorne, A., &amp; Kelley, M. (2015). Coordinated Public Health Initiatives to Address Violence Against Women and Adolescents. ''Journal of Women's Health (15409996)'', ''24''(1), 80–85 6p. doi:10.1089/jwh.2014.4884&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe there is a similar pattern of over-demand.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Utilization by women is not consistent across the population of intimate partner violence victims, however. Women with children tend to use shelters more often as well as those that are injured physically.&lt;ref&gt;Clevenger, B. M., &amp; Roe-Sepowitz, D. (2009). Shelter Service Utilization of Domestic Violence Victims. ''Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment'', ''19''(4), 370. doi:10.1080/10911350902787429&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, rural women have more trouble accessing services due to isolation and a lack of resources.&lt;ref name="Peek-Asa, C. 2011"&gt;Peek-Asa, C., Wallis, A., Harland, K., Beyer, K., Dickey, P., &amp; Saftlas, A. (2011). Rural Disparity in Domestic Violence Prevalence and Access to Resources. ''Journal of Women's Health (15409996)'', ''20''(11), 1743 7p. doi:10.1089/jwh.2011.2891&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other services offered ===
Shelters are usually offered as part of a comprehensive domestic violence program that can also include a [[crisis hotline]], services for non-sheltered children, an education program, a community speaker list, and an offender treatment program.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Shelters themselves also offer a variety of services. They provide counseling, support groups and skills workshops to help women move on independently.&lt;ref&gt;Clevenger, B. M., &amp; Roe-Sepowitz, D. (2009). Shelter Service Utilization of Domestic Violence Victims. ''Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment'', ''19''(4), 359–374. doi:10.1080/10911350902787429&lt;/ref&gt; These act as tools of empowerment for women in conjunction with goal setting programs. Lastly, they offer support for children as well as legal and medical advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Clevenger, B. M., &amp; Roe-Sepowitz, D. (2009). Shelter Service Utilization of Domestic Violence Victims. ''Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment'', ''19''(4), 362. doi:10.1080/10911350902787429&lt;/ref&gt;

Most residents of women's shelters are the children of women who are victims of violence. This is one reason why more than half of shelters offered services to this portion of the population in a survey of 215 shelters in the United States.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt; Services for children often include counseling and group therapy options that are meant to strengthen parent-child relationships and help with mental well-being.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt; Recently, shelters also responded to increasing numbers of male victims by offering help mostly in the form of hotel vouchers.&lt;ref name="Chanmugam" /&gt;

=== Male residents ===
{{see also|Domestic violence against men#Responses}}
In the United States, certain shelters do not permit access to men.  This practice was challenged in ''Blumhorst v. Haven Hills,'' a court case in California (''Los Angeles Superior Court Case No. BC291977''). However, the court dismissed the case because the plaintiff lacked standing &amp;ndash; he was not involved in an abusive relationship and did not need shelter.&lt;ref&gt;Molly Dragiewicz &amp; Yvonne Lindgren, The Gendered Nature of Domestic Violence: Statistical Data for Lawyers Considering Equal Protection Analysis, 17 Am. U. J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 229, 268 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Certain groups are critical of the smaller amount of resources available to men in the United States and across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Tsui, V. (2014). Male Victims of Intimate Partner Abuse: Use and Helpfulness of Services. ''Social Work'', ''59''(2), 121–130 10p. doi:sw/swu007&lt;/ref&gt; However, other sources dispute the view that male-only refuges are wanted or needed by most male victims, arguing that the issue has been misrepresented out of misogyny rather than genuine concern for male victims.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons (20 May 2008) [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmhaff/263/26310.htm#n224 ''House of Commons Sixth Report''] House of Commons. Retrieved 4 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Istanbul Convention, for example, states that the creation of women's shelters is not discriminatory.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Some shelters do permit access today, including the Domestic Abuse Project (DAP) of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]] which offers services to both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dapdc.org/|title=The Domestic Abuse Project of Delaware County|website=www.dapdc.org|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to their own reports, around three percent of DAP supported individuals have been men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.delcotimes.com/general-news/20131007/help-domestic-abuse-victims-for-35-years|title=Help domestic abuse victims for 35 years|website=www.delcotimes.com|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, 100 places were opened to house male victims of domestic violence in Northamptonshire, or to house families barred from other shelters, such as women with older male children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1146783/First-refuges-battered-husbands-offer-support-male-victims.html|title=First refuges for battered husbands offer support to male victims|date=16 February 2009|work=Mail Online|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Canada, approximately 8 percent of women's shelters are also open to adult men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2011001/article/11495-eng.htm|title=Shelters for abused women in Canada, 2010|last2=Cotter|first2=Cotter|website=Statistics Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|last1=Burczycka|first1=Marta|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==

=== United States ===

Women's shelters in the United States are supported at a state and national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/ovw/grant-programs|title=Grant Programs {{!}} OVW {{!}} Department of Justice|website=www.justice.gov|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 50% of the funding offered at the state level, however, comes from the federal government through grants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Services are generally administered through Domestic Violence Intervention Programs (DVIPs) funded by the Family Violence Services Act, the [[Victims of Crime Act of 1984]], and the [[Violence Against Women Act]]. Various non-profits also contribute to the services offered and provide a national voice for the issue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Examples include the [[National Network to End Domestic Violence]] which represents fifty-six U.S. states and territories, the National Organization for Victim Assistance, and local United Ways.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trynova.org/|title=National Organization for Victim Assistance (NOVA) – Championing Dignity Compassion Victims Crime and CrisisNational Organization for Victim Assistance|website=www.trynova.org|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports show that on any day over 5,000 women are unable to use services because of a lack of funding or space.&lt;ref name="Peek-Asa, C. 2011" /&gt; Many states have also cut their funds for women's shelters. In 2009, [[Governor Schwarzenegger]] of [[California]] cut $16 million in state funding to [[domestic violence]] programs because of the state's budget deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/us/26domestic.html|title=Losing State Aid, California Women's Shelters Cut Back or Close|date=25 September 2009|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|last1=McKinley|first1=Jesse}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011 [[Washington (state)|Washington]] governor [[Christine Gregoire]] released a budget proposal stripping all state funding for domestic violence and women's shelters across Washington State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2011|title=Taking It Seriously: Repairing Domestic Violence Sentencing in Washington State|url=http://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2029&amp;context=sulr|journal=Seattle University Law Review|volume=34|pages=963–992|last1=Sully|first1=Patricia}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of budget cuts caused several shelters to close their doors, leaving women with no safe haven to escape Intimate partner violence.

== Effects ==
Women often suffer lasting mental conditions from their abuse including [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]s (PTSD).&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009"/&gt; Since women in shelters have more likely experienced severe physical and mental abuse than those who do not utilize these services, they are also more likely to experience PTSD.&lt;ref name="Perez" /&gt; In fact, a national organizational survey compiled four separate studies of female support group or shelter users and reported PTSD rates between 45% and 84% (Astin, Lawrence, Pincus, &amp; Foy, 1990; Houskamp &amp; Foy,1991; Roberts, 1996a; Saunders, 1994).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These emotional and mental consequences have an effect on women's career opportunities and ability to function in normal life.&lt;ref name="McNulty, M. 2009"/&gt; Women's shelters try to counteract these effects as well as prevent future instances of abuse. However, PTSD can prohibit women from utilizing shelter resources effectively.&lt;ref name="Perez" /&gt;

Shelter utilization may lead to the better functioning of survivors and fewer reports of abuse in the short term.&lt;ref&gt;McFarlane, J., Nava, A., Gilroy, H., Paulson, R., &amp; Maddoux, J. (2012). Testing Two Global Models to Prevent Violence against Women and Children: Methods and Baseline Data Analysis of a Seven-Year Prospective Study. ''Issues In Mental Health Nursing'', ''33''(12), 872 11p.&lt;/ref&gt; Research that studied 3,410 residents of 215 domestic violence across the United States linked longer shelter stays with increased well-being and better help-seeking behaviors.&lt;ref name="Perez, S. 2012"&gt;Lyon, E., Lane, S., &amp; Menard, A. (2008). Domestic violence shelters: Survivors experiences. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/225025.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is a result of increased knowledge about services and options available to women in vulnerable positions as well as increased empowerment.&lt;ref name="Perez, S. 2012" /&gt; This may indicate that transition services and longer residential offerings are more valuable.

=== Criticism ===
Many women report re-abuse after leaving a shelter.  A sample study done by Bybee and Sullivan, which analyzed data from 124 victims who utilized shelters, found no positive effect on re-abuse three years after shelter use.&lt;ref&gt;Bybee, D., Sullivan, C. (. (0001). Predicting re-victimization of battered women 3 years after exiting a shelter program (English). ''American Journal of Community Psychology'', ''36''(1–2), 85–96.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, with current resource restraints in the United States, standard shelters do not provide the PTSD or psychotherapeutic treatments necessary for full support.&lt;ref name="Perez, S. 2012"/&gt; They also have issues with under-serving the community because of a shortage of funded staff, a lack of bilingual staff, and inadequate facilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Shelters in Europe are similarly limited and only eight countries fulfill the minimum standards for shelters set by the Istanbul Convention.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Another criticism of the shelters in Europe is that they have strict age limits that keep male children out and certain shelters discriminate against women from other countries or who identify as lesbian or transgender.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Update|type=section|date=December 2011}}
The '''2001 [[World Conference against Racism]] (WCAR)''', also known as '''Durban I''', was held at the [[Durban International Convention Centre]] in [[Durban]], South Africa, under [[UN]] auspices, from 31 August to 8 September 2001.

The conference covered several controversial issues, including [[redress]] for transatlantic [[slavery]] and the [[Second-class citizen]]ry issue in Palestine-Israel.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/legacy/campaigns/race/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/WCAR/pressreleases/rd-d21.html&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the final Declaration and Programme of Action produced by the conference was strongly disputed in these areas, both in the preparatory meetings in the months that preceded the conference and during the conference itself.

Two delegations, the United States and Israel, withdrew from the conference over objections to a draft document [[equating Zionism with racism]]. The final Declaration and Programme of Action did not contain the text that the U.S. and Israel had objected to, that text having been voted out by delegates in the days after the U.S. and Israel withdrew.

In parallel to the conference, a separately held NGO Forum also produced a Declaration and Programme of its own, that was not an official Conference document, which contained language relating to Israel that the WCAR had voted to exclude from its Declaration, and which was criticized by then [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] [[Mary Robinson]] and many others.

The NGO Forum ended in discord. Mary Robinson lost the support of the United States in her office of High Commissioner, and many of the potential political aftereffects of the conference were annulled by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. The attacks took place just three days after the conference ended, entirely eclipsing it in the news, and significantly affecting international relations and politics. The conference was followed by the 2009 [[Durban II]] conference in [[Geneva]], which was boycotted by ten western countries. A commemorative [[Durban III]] conference in September 2011 in New York has also drawn significant criticism and was boycotted by 14 western countries.

== Preparations ==
The conference was authorized by [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution]] #52/111. Prior to the conference various preparatory meetings (PrepComs) were held in order to identify conference themes and to create initial drafts of the Declaration and Programme of Action. These PrepComs encountered difficulties from the start.&lt;ref name=Schechter&gt;{{cite book|pages=177&amp;ndash;182|title=United Nations Global Conferences|author=Michael G. Schechter|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-34380-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first problem was the question of what the conference theme was to be. The Western European states, along with the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, all wanted the conference objectives to be those given in the authorizing resolution. The Africa Group, the Latin American states, and the Caribbean states wanted the conference objectives to go beyond what was in the resolution, and include items dealing with regional, national, and international measures for compensation for colonialism and slavery.&lt;ref name="Schechter"/&gt;

Prior to the conference, there were also four Regional Conferences, in [[Strasbourg]], [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Dakar]], and [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;

== The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action ==
The Durban Declaration and Programme of Action was adopted by the governmental delegates attending the Conference at the International Convention Centre.

=== Compensation for Colonialism and Slavery ===
{{See also|Reparations for slavery}}

The issue of Compensation for Colonialism and Slavery is addressed in ¶ 13, ¶ 14, ¶ 15, and ¶ 29 of the Declaration. It was one of the most controversial issues debated at the conference, one that had the potential to derail the entire conference. It was dealt with cleverly in the Declaration, containing rhetoric that satisfied the African bloc, without applying retroactively against the descendants of colonizers the principle of crimes against humanity and without establishing a clear responsibility for reparations on the parts of former colonial states.&lt;ref name=Chakma&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Rights in Development Yearbook 2001: Reparations: Redressing Past Wrongs|editor=George Ulrich and Louise Krabbe Boserup|chapter=The Issue of Compensation for Colonialism and Slavery at the World Conference Against Racism|author=Suhas Chakma|pages=58&amp;ndash;71|year=2003|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-411-2030-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording of the Declaration struck a delicate balance. Whilst acknowledging historic and contemporary practices of slavery and the slave trade as morally outrageous, and something that would be a crime against humanity today, it did not apply that legal principle to an era before the principle actually existed.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

One of the contentious points at the conference related to the issue was that of [[apartheid]]. During the preparatory processes of the conference, South Africa stressed that it did not want to link compensation to apartheid. At the Tehran Regional Conference, a paragraph making such a link was inserted by Asian governments. This was deleted at the request of the South African delegation. Linking compensation to apartheid had the potential to polarize South African society, and produce the same effects as had the controversial [[land reform in Zimbabwe|land reform programmes in Zimbabwe]]. Domestic political pressures, and the aim of the South African government to foster reconciliation within the country, made South Africa's position difficult.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

The issue of compensation was thus a complex one, that was exacerbated by the [[President of Senegal]], [[Abdoulaye Wade]], calling campaigns to demand compensation for colonialism and slavery "childish".&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

The earliest point at which the issue of compensation caused problems was during preparations in May 2001, when delegations came to the decision of where to place it on the agenda. At the time, the fourth item on the agenda, out of five items, was "Provision of effective remedies, recourses, redress, compensatory, and other measures, at the national, regional, and international levels". The European Union, represented by Portugal, wanted to place the entire language in brackets. The United States just wanted to place the word "compensatory" in brackets. The African Group, Armenia, and Cuba strongly objected to both proposals, with the African Group stating that if the topic were placed in brackets, they would move for the entire text to be placed in brackets also. In the end, the U.S. proposal was adopted, with the addition of a statement in the report indicating the different perspectives on the exact meaning of those brackets. Western European states discussed informally amongst themselves, outside of the formal preparatory proceedings, what measures and levels of non-cöoperation they might adopt if the issue of compensation gained momentum at Durban itself.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

Before the conference, the debate over compensation was seen as dealing with the transatlantic slave trade, and the colonization of Africa by Europeans, thus pitting Western European states (including the former colonial powers of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom) and the United States against the African Group. The African Group was supported by Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

Prior to the conference, on 2001-08-03, the African Group circulated a Non-Paper on the "Injustices of the Past", containing strong language but a generally moderate position. To this paper the E.U. responded, on 2001-08-08, with a Non-Paper of its own that addressed most, but not all, of the issues in the African Group's paper. The United States circulated a Non-Paper as well, but this turned out to be less helpful than the E.U. one.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

The African Group circulated a second Non-Paper on 2001-09-03 that was substantially stronger than its earlier one, with language shifts from "[[debt relief|debt cancellation]]" to "immediate and unconditional cancellation of debt", emphasis upon crimes against humanity, and calls for reparation (something which the earlier paper had not included in part because of a U.S. demand, made at a preparatory meeting in Geneva, that such language be excluded from the text).&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

Several members of the African Group openly opposed calling for reparations. President Wade stated "We still suffer the effects of slavery and colonialism, and that cannot be evaluated in monetary terms. I find that not only absurd, but insulting.". Similarly, South Africa was more interested in devoting time and effort to more pragmatic ends, such as Western aid for the [[Millennium Africa Recovery Programme]], which would be more palatable to the U.S. and the E.U.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

A consensus on the reparations issue was reached by late August. On 2001-08-24 President of the United States [[George W. Bush]] announced in a press conference that "the reparations issue has been solved &amp;mdash; at least the last information I had was that the issue has … looks like it has been resolved", albeit that news media at the time failed to realize the significance of the comment. The U.S. walked out of the conference a few weeks later.&lt;ref name=Chakma /&gt;

=== Zionism ===

==== Draft text prior to the conference ====
During preparatory meetings in Geneva, text that linked [[Zionism]] to [[racism]] was placed in brackets, with the expectation that it would be replaced by text that referred to violations of the rights of Palestinians. The U.S. had already threatened to boycott the conference should the conference draft documents include text that could be in any way interpreted as linking Zionism to racism. [[Mary Robinson]] had also said that regional political conflicts should not be imposed upon the agenda of the conference. The Australian, the Canadian, and some European delegations shared the U.S. view.&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram&gt;{{cite news|work=Al-Ahram Weekly Online|date=9 August 2001|issue=546|location=Cairo|publisher=AL-AHRAM|author=Dina Ezzat|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/546/fr2.htm|title=Reading between the brackets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab position was stated by the Secretary General of the [[Arab League]], [[Amr Moussa]]: "Israel's racist actions against the Palestinian people have to be dealt with in an international conference that aims to eradicate racism. Arab countries are not expecting the Durban conference to be a venue for dealing with the Arab- Israeli peace process, but they certainly expect that the Israeli racist practices against the Palestinian people will not be overlooked."&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;

The Arab delegates were not insistent upon language that specifically equated Zionism with racism. It had been suggested that they were trying to revive [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]] (issued 1975, annulled 1991) which stated that "Zionism is a form of racism.". Their position was that they were, rather, trying to underline that the actions being committed by Israel against Palestinians were racist.&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;

This stance was in part influenced by the U.S. threat of boycott, which would have made it impractical to insist upon harsh language condemning Israel or equating the suffering of the Palestinians with that of holocaust victims. According to one Arab diplomat, no Arab state except for Syria had insisted upon any language linking Israel to racist practices.&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;

At the start of the Geneva meeting, text had been presented that comprised six bracketed paragraphs dealing with "Zionist racist practices", including an appeal for Israel "to revise its legislation based on racial or religious discrimination such as the law of return and all the policies of an occupying power which prevent the Palestinian refugees and displaced persons from returning to their homes and properties", and a suggestion for the need "to bring the foreign occupation of Jerusalem by Israel together with all its racist practices to an end".&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;

By the end of the meeting, all of this text had either been removed or toned down. One such phrase removed was a mention of "holocausts" suffered by other peoples, which had been seen as an affront to the memory of the Jewish victims of [[The Holocaust|the Nazi holocaust]]. South African diplomats had already told Arab and Muslim countries that they would have to offer text that could describe the current situation without using such language as "ethnic cleansing practices against Palestinians".&lt;ref name=Al-Ahram /&gt;

Nonetheless, the United States, objecting to the remaining text, decided to send a low-level delegation, headed by Ambassador [[Michael Southwick]], to the Conference, rather than have [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] attend himself. German officials criticized this decision, and the United States [[Congressional Black Caucus]] urged him to attend. The [[Anti-Defamation League]] urged him to stay away.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;

==== Withdrawal by U.S. and Israel ====
On September 3, 2001, after four days of deadlocked negotiations that did not reach agreement on language, the United States and Israeli delegations withdrew from the conference. Both United States Secretary of State Colin Powell and [[Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel]] [[Shimon Peres]] stated that this was done with regret.&lt;ref name=Klusener&gt;{{cite news|title=Accusations Fly As US, Israel Walk Out Of "Bizarre" UN Conference|author=Mark Klusener|work=CNSNews.com|date=4 September 2001|url=http://www.cnsnews.com./ForeignBureaus%5Carchive%5C200109%5CFor20010904a.html|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307115734/http://www.cnsnews.com/ForeignBureaus/Archive/200109/For20010904a.html|archive-date=7 March 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|title=US abandons racism summit|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=3 September 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1523600.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news|title=Racism summit turmoil: Reactions|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=3 September 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1523830.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This decision was criticized by several people, including [[Jesse Jackson]] and [[President of South Africa]] [[Thabo Mbeki]], both of whom stated their opinions that it had been a mistake by the United States to send a low-level delegation to the conference in the first place, and [[Amnesty International]], which stated that the U.S. was "letting down victims of racism". Jackson had been involved in earlier attempts to create compromise language.&lt;ref name=Klusener /&gt;

The low-level U.S. delegation had kept a low profile throughout conference proceedings until that point, with delegates working quietly in sub-committee meetings, without (unlike in earlier conferences) giving news briefings or off the record statements to journalists, to change the text of the draft declaration, to make it less forceful and less specific against Israel, and to bring it into line with U.S. foreign policy goals with respect to the [[International Criminal Court]] (see [[United States and the International Criminal Court]]) by removing language that strengthened the ICC.&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel and United States storm out from Durban Conference, denouncing draft declaration as "racist"|author=Robert E. Sullivan|date=25 September 2002|work=The Earth Times|url=http://earthtimes.org./sep/thedurbanconferenceisraelsep4_01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The draft documents had stated "deep concern" at the "increase of racist practices of Zionism and anti-Semitism" and talked of the emergence of "movements based on racism and discriminatory ideas, in particular the Zionist movement, which is based on racial superiority". Alternative proposals, which the U.S. had supported, from Norway, acting as a mediator, and Canada were rejected by Israel.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=OQA&gt;{{cite news|title=Africa: The United States and Israel pull out of the Durban Racism Conference|work=allAfrica.com|date=3 September 2001|author=[[Ofeibea Quist-Arcton]]|location=Durban|url=http://allafrica.com./stories/200109030134.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC3&gt;{{cite news|title=Racism summit seeks breakthrough|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=5 September 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1525981.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Colin Powell's denunciation of the "hateful language" that "singles out only one country in the world, Israel, for censure and abuse" in the draft text and U.S. delegate [[Tom Lantos]]'s statement that the conference had been "wrecked by Arab and Islamic extremists", some saw the U.S. delegation's withdrawal as not being entirely related to the language on Israel, but attributed it also, in part, to a reluctance on the part of the U.S. to address the issue of slavery.&lt;ref name=Klusener /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC3 /&gt;

The withdrawal of, the U.S. and Israel was taken as a warning by many delegates that there was a strong possibility of Canada and the E.U. states withdrawing as well if no compromise was reached. Several reports had the Europeans staying on solely in order to help South Africa salvage the Conference. After the withdrawal, senior conference officials became highly involved in the rewriting of the Declaration &amp;mdash; something that critics maintained they should have also been doing before that point.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;

==== Final text and subsequent reaction ====
In the end, the Conference delegates voted to reject the language that implicitly accused Israel of racism, and the document actually published contained no such language.&lt;ref name=BBC4&gt;{{cite news|date=8 September 2001|title=Mixed emotions as Durban winds up|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1530976.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries were unhappy with the final text's approach to the subject, but all for different reasons. Syria and Iran were unhappy because their demands for the language about racism and Israel had been rejected by the Conference, the latter continuing its insistence that Israel was a racist state. Australia was unhappy with the process, observing that "far too much of the time at the conference [had been] consumed by bitter divisive exchanges on issues which have done nothing to advance the cause of combating racism". Canada was also unhappy.&lt;ref name=BBC4 /&gt;

The language of the final text was carefully drafted for balance. The word "diaspora" is used four times, and solely to refer to the [[African Diaspora]]. The document is at pains to maintain a cohesive identity for everyone of African heritage as a victim of slavery, even including those who may have more European than African ancestors. The "victim" or "victims" of racism and slavery (the two words occurring 90 times in the document) are defined in only the most general geographic terms. The word "Jewish" is only used once, alongside "Muslim" and "Arab", and "anti-Semitism" is only used twice, once alongside its assumed counterpart of "Islamophobia" and once alongside "anti-Arabism". The difficulty that this generates is that it is politically impossible to act when the 219 calls for action in the Programme are couched in such generalities that only the "countless human beings" that the document explicitly talks of can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|pages=148|booktitle=Rhetorical Democracy: Discursive Practices of Civic Engagement &amp;mdash; Rhetoric Society of America Conference|editor=Gerard A.

== The NGO Forum Declaration ==
Separate from the actual Conference itself was an NGO Forum, held in the nearby [[Sahara Stadium Kingsmead|Kingsmead Stadium]] in Durban, that ran from 2001-08-28 to 2001-09-01. This was a forum of 3,000 [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, attended by 8,000 representatives. It, too adopted a Declaration. However, this was not an official document of the WCAR and was not issued as such.&lt;ref name=Hindu1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hindu.com./thehindu/2001/09/09/stories/05091344.htm|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=9 September 2001|title=The different shades of hatred}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UN1&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=[[United Nations]]|work=World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance|location=Durban|date=5 September 2001|title=DAILY PRESS BRIEFING|url=http://www.un.org./WCAR/pressreleases/db090501.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Forum's proceedings were highly disorganized, with several NGO delegates walking out of the Forum, to the jeers of other delegates, and ending in discord; and the resultant declaration had 62 paragraphs of introduction, followed by a document that appeared to commentators as being the result of every lobby putting its pet aversions in. It described Israel as a "racist, apartheid state" that was guilty of "racist crimes including war crimes, acts of genocide and ethnic cleansing". The document was not intended to be presented to the Conference, although a copy of it was intended to be handed over, as a symbolic gesture, to the Conference secretary-general, Mary Robinson, at the conclusion of the Forum. Ms Robinson refused to accept the document, citing concerns over its language. In a later interview she said of the whole conference that "there was horrible anti-Semitism present &amp;mdash; particularly in some of the NGO discussions. A number people said they've never been so hurt or so harassed or been so blatantly faced with an anti-Semitism."&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hindu1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=UN1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC5&gt;{{cite news|date=21 November 2002|title=Mary Robinson, UN Human Rights chief|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/forum/1673034.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Palestinian Solidarity Committee of South Africa reportedly distributed copies of the antisemitic forgery ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=8N0TwbYCycAC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=World+Conference+against+Racism+2001+protocols+of+the+elders+of+zion#v=onepage&amp;q=World%20Conference%20against%20Racism%202001%20protocols%20of%20the%20elders%20of%20zion&amp;f=false | title = Dismantling the big lie: The Protocols of the elders of Zion | isbn = 978-0-88125-786-1 | author1 = Jacobs | first1 = Steven L | last2 = Weitzman | first2 = Mark | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics described the description of [[Israel and the apartheid analogy|Israel as apartheid]] as the "Durban Strategy". They claim that this comparison was made with the intention of causing and encouraging [[divestment]] from and [[economic and political boycotts of Israel|boycott of Israel]].&lt;ref name=SteinbergCJN&gt;{{cite news|author=Steinberg, Gerald|url=http://www.jewishtoronto.net/content_display.html?ArticleID=185328|title=Anti-Israel obsessions|work=[[Canadian Jewish News]]|date=15 June 2006|publisher=United Jewish Communities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1139395488268&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=The radicals behind the Anglican Church|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=26 February 2006|author=Sarah Mandel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://c4rpme.org/bin/articles.cgi?Cat=activist-roadblock&amp;Subcat=sabeel&amp;ID=601 C4RPME.org: A Christmas Wish for 'Justice'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NGO Forum was attended by U.S. NGOs, with financial support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the [[MacArthur Foundation]], and the [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation]]. The [[Ford Foundation]] provided [[United States dollar|USD]]10 million in support to the WCAR and the NGO Forum. These NGOs provided research assistance at the Forum and helped to develop declarations and resolutions that dealt with the issue of compensation for slavery.&lt;ref name=Fonte&gt;{{cite book|title=Israel and the Post-Zionists: A Nation at Risk|editor=Shlomo Sharan|author=John Fonte|chapter=The Future of the Ideological Civil War Within the West|pages=136&amp;ndash;138|year=2003|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=1-903900-52-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marable&gt;{{cite web|title=The Failure of U.S. Foreign Policies|author=Manning Marable|date=17 November 2001|url=http://zmag.org./sustainers/content/2001-11/17marable.cfm|publisher=|work=Z Mag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolutions adopted by the Forum dealing with reparations for slavery dealt only with the transatlantic slave trade, and did not mention the traffic in African slaves to Islamic lands in the Middle East. The Forum also called upon the United States to ratify all major human rights treaties that had already been ratified.&lt;ref name=Fonte /&gt;

One such treaty was the UN [[Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] (CERD), which the U.S. had ratified in 1994, but (per the [[Supremacy Clause]] of [[Article Six of the United States Constitution]], which does not permit treaties to override the Constitution) had attached a reservation that its ratification did not accept treaty requirements that were incompatible with the [[Constitution of the United States]]. The NGOs, including [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], demanded that U.S. drop its reservations and "comply" with the treaty. The U.S. Department of State had noted specifically that CERD's restrictions on [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly]] were incompatible with the [[First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. The United States was far from the only such country to do so, however. Incompatibility of the treaty with national constitutions, including the freedoms of assembly and speech guaranteed by those constitutions, is also noted by Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, France, Guyana, Jamaica, Japan, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Switzerland, and Thailand. Several, including France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malta, Monaco, Nepal, the United Kingdom, note that they consider the provisions of the treaty to be restricted by and subject to the freedoms of speech and assembly set forth in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Fonte /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org./english/bodies/ratification/2.htm#reservations|publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]|title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination &amp;mdash; Reservations|date=18 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One commentator noted that in order to comply with the interpretation of CERD created by the NGOs at the Forum, the United States would have to "turn its political and economic system, together with their underlying principles, upside down &amp;mdash; abandoning the free speech guarantees of the Constitution, bypassing federalism, and ignoring the very concept of majority rule, since practically nothing in the NGO agenda is supported by the [U.S.] electorate", stating that these NGOs were "a new challenge to [[liberal democracy]]" that contested the principles of individual rights, democratic representation, and national citizenship, along with contesting the very idea of a liberal democratic nation-state.&lt;ref name=Fonte /&gt;

Other NGO demands included demands for:&lt;ref name=Fonte /&gt;
* U.S. acknowledgement of "the breadth and pervasiveness of institutional racism" that "permeates every institution at every level"
* a declaration that "racial bias corrupts every stage of the [U.S.] criminal justice process, from suspicion to investigation, arrest, prosecution, trial, and sentencing"
* support for and expansion of hate crimes legislation at both state and federal levels
* U.S. condemnation of any opposition to [[affirmative action]]
* U.S. recognition of an adequate standard of living as "a right, not a privilege"
* a statement that the U.S. deplored the "denial of economic rights"
* the promotion of multilingualism by the U.S. instead of "discriminatory" emphasis on English language acquisition in U.S. schools
* the denunciation of [[free market]] [[capitalism]] as a "fundamentally flawed system"

Tom Lantos assigns the blame for the withdrawal of the U.S. in part to the radicalism of many of the NGOs at the NGO Forum, to an inadequate response thereto by U.S.-based NGOs, and to the reluctance of the U.S.'s European allies to take a strong stand.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite book|title=The United States and the Rule of Law in International Affairs|author=John Francis Murphy|pages=326&amp;ndash;328|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-52968-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The Conference was largely overshadowed in the news and in international affairs by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], which occurred 3 days after the Conference ended.

=== Mary Robinson's tenure as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ===
As a consequence of the Conference, the United States did not support the continuation of Mary Robinson as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, where once U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] had called her a "splendid choice" for the post and the U.S. had considered her its favorite candidate for the job. She stepped down from the post in September 2002.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

Many faults were attributed to Ms Robinson, with cumulative effect on the U.S. position. Some people stated that she lacked mediation and bureaucratic experience, and thus was unable to resolve sensitive issues at the Conference. News reports attributed her differences with the U.S. to four things: First, her views on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|Israel-Palestine conflict]] differed from U.S. policy. Second, the U.S. did not approve of the detached way in which she acted as secretary-general to the Conference. Third, she had openly criticized the U.S. on various matters including the treatment of prisoners at [[Camp X-Ray]], the "unsigning" of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] by the U.S., and the administration of [[capital punishment in the United States]]. Fourth, she had opposed U.S. calls to reform the election process of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

Tom Lantos himself did not assign sole or even primary blame to Robinson for the breakdown of U.S. relations with the conference. That he assigned to the NGOs, as aforementioned, and to the member states of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]]. Moreover, several people have defended Robinson's secretary-generalship of the conference.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

=== NGO repudiations of the NGO Forum's Declaration ===
Several NGOs, including [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Amnesty International]], and the [[Lawyers Committee for Human Rights]], disassociated themselves from the language of the NGO Forum's Declaration that dealt with Israel and with Jews.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;

=== Followups ===
It seems unlikely to analysts that the United States will support another WCAR. However, the Declaration and Programme of Action did make provision for follow-up mechanisms. Mary Robinson stated in her closing address that the Conference was intended to be a beginning, not an end. Dr. [[Manning Marable]], of [[Columbia University in New York]], pointed out that one of the objectives of the Conference was to increase coordination in human rights activities, and to strengthen networks amongst those combating racism; and as such the actions of governments in response to the Conference are not the sole intended outcomes &amp;mdash; actions by civil society and non-governmental agencies are also required.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.columbia.edu./cu/news/01/08/UN_conference.html|publisher=[[Columbia University in New York]]|author=James Devitt|date=15 August 2001|title=Manning Marable to Address U.N. World Conference against Racism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such follow up provision is for national governments to provide the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights with reports on their actions towards implementing the recommendations in the Programme of Action. Another is for the [[Secretary General of the United Nations]] to appoint an expert body with the remit of following up on implementation. A third is a call for the establishment of a database of practical means for addressing racism, racial discrimination, and related intolerance.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;

A Permanent Memorial Trust Fund has also been established for the creation of a memorial at the New York United Nations site. The sculpture, to be titled the Permanent Memorial to the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade, or the [[UN Slavery Memorial]], is set to be completed in 2012.

By resolution #2002/68 of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] an Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action was established, which held its first meeting in January 2003 and which meets on an annual basis.&lt;ref name=Schechter /&gt;

In resolution #61/149 of the [[United Nations General Assembly]], passed in 1996, a [[Durban Review Conference]] was called. The conference took place in 2009, however, a number of countries expressed concern as a result of the 2001 conference. Some countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, and the United States, boycotted the conference. The Czech Republic discontinued its attendance on the first day, and twenty-three other European Union countries sent low-level delegations. In an 18 April 2009 speech, President [[Barack Obama]] announced the United States' boycott of the 2009 [[Durban Review Conference]], reaffirming the country's opposition to language perceived as anti-Israel and anti-Western.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0409/As_expected_Obama_admin_to_boycott_Durban_II_.html|publisher=[[The Politico]]|author=[[Ben Smith (journalist)|Ben Smith]]|date=18 April 2009|title=As expected, Obama admin to boycott Durban II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United Kingdom and other European countries remain undecided. On 17 February 2009, [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] Minister [[Lord Malloch-Brown]] said: "If we can’t go forward now, we will withdraw. I was at the first conference. I have never seen such a disgraceful event in quite a long international life."

=== Influence ===

The Institute for Global Jewish Affairs was founded, in part, as a response to the perceived [[Anti-Semitism]] of the Durban conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=84&amp;FID=588&amp;PID=2274&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard-Henri Lévy]] credits the conference with being one of the inspirations for his book, ''[[Left in Dark Times: A Stand Against the New Barbarism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The God That Failed: 'Left in Dark Times,' By ADAM KIRSCH, 10 September 2008 [http://www.nysun.com/arts/the-god-that-failed-left-in-dark-times-by-bernard/85499/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[human genetics]], the '''Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor''' ('''Y-MRCA''', informally known as '''Y-chromosomal Adam''') is the [[most recent common ancestor]] (MRCA) from whom all [[Present day|currently living]] men are descended [[Patrilineality|patrilineally]]. The term Y-MRCA reflects the fact that the [[Y chromosome]]s of all currently living males are directly derived from the Y chromosome of this remote ancestor. The analogous concept of the matrilineal most recent common ancestor is known as "[[Mitochondrial Eve]]" (mt-MRCA, named for the matrilineal transmission of [[mtDNA]]), the most recent woman from whom all living humans are descended [[matrilineality|matrilineally]]. As with "Mitochondrial Eve", the title of "Y-chromosomal Adam" is not permanently fixed to a single individual, but can advance over the course of human history as paternal lineages become extinct.

Estimates of the time when Y-MRCA lived have also shifted as modern knowledge of human ancestry changes. In 2013, the discovery of a previously unknown [[Y-chromosomal haplogroup]] was announced,&lt;ref name="Mendez13"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Definition==
{{Human timeline}}
{{main article|Most recent common ancestor{{!}}MRCA}}
The Y-chromosomal most recent common ancestor is the [[most recent common ancestor]] of the [[Y-chromosome]]s found in currently living human males.

Due to the definition via the "currently living" population, the identity of a MRCA, and by extension of the human Y-MRCA, is time-dependent (it depends on the moment in time intended by the term "currently").
The MRCA of a population may move forward in time as archaic lineages within the population go extinct:
once a lineage has died out, it is irretrievably lost. This mechanism can thus only shift the title of Y-MRCA forward in time. Such an event could be due to the total extinction of several basal haplogroups.&lt;ref name="ancestors_tale" /&gt;
The same holds for the concepts of matrilineal and patrilineal MRCAs: it follows from the definition of Y-MRCA that he had at least two sons who both have unbroken lineages that have survived to the present day. If the lineages of all but one of those sons die out, then the title of Y-MRCA shifts forward from the remaining son through his patrilineal descendants, until the first descendant is reached who had at least two sons who both have living, patrilineal descendants. The title of Y-MRCA is not permanently fixed to a single individual, and the Y-MRCA for any given population would himself have been part of a population which had its own, more remote, Y-MRCA.

Although the informal name "Y-chromosomal Adam" is a reference to the [[Adam|biblical Adam]], this should not be misconstrued as implying that the bearer of the chromosome was the only human male alive during his time.&lt;ref name = "Takahata93"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Takahata |first1= N |title=Allelic genealogy and human evolution |journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=2–22 |date=January 1993 |pmid=8450756 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a039995}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--as has sometimes been naively proposed{{whom}} based on naive association with the Genesis narrative (who has even come up with this and why does it have to be debunked in a prominent position of this article?)--&gt;
His other male contemporaries may also have descendants alive today, but not, by definition, through solely patrilineal descent; in other words, none of them have an unbroken male line of descendants (''son's son's son's … son'') connecting them to currently living people.

By the nature of the concept of most recent common ancestors, these estimates can only represent a ''[[terminus ante quem]]'' ("limit before which"), until the genome of the entire population has been examined (in this case, the genome of all living humans).

==Age estimate==
Estimates on the age of the Y-MRCA crucially depend on the most archaic known haplogroup extant in contemporary populations. {{As of|2018}}, this is  [[haplogroup A00]] (discovered in 2013). Age estimates based on this published during 2014&amp;ndash;2015 range between 160,000 and 300,000 years, compatible with the time of emergence and early dispersal of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.&lt;ref name=elhaik&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elhaik E, Tatarinova TV, Klyosov AA, Graur D |title= The ‘extremely ancient’ chromosome that isn’t: a forensic bioinformatic investigation of Albert Perry’s X-degenerate portion of the Y chromosome |journal= European Journal of Human Genetics|volume= 22|issue=9 | pages= 1111–16 |year= 2014 |pmid=24448544|doi= 10.1038/ejhg.2013.303 |pmc=4135414}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bottleneck"/&gt;

===Method===
In addition to the tendency of the title of Y-MRCA to shift forward in time, the estimate of the Y-MRCA's DNA sequence, his position in the family tree, the time when he lived, and his place of origin, are all subject to future revisions.

The following events would change the estimate of who the individual designated as Y-MRCA was:
* Further sampling of Y chromosomes could uncover previously unknown divergent lineages. If this happens, Y-chromosome lineages would converge on an individual who lived further back in time.
* The discovery of additional deep rooting mutations in known lineages could lead to a rearrangement of the family tree.
* Revision of the Y-chromosome mutation rate (see below) can change the estimate of the time when he lived.

The time when Y-MRCA lived is determined by applying a [[molecular clock]] to human Y-chromosomes. In contrast to [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA), which has a short sequence of 16,000 [[base pair]]s, and mutates frequently, the Y chromosome is significantly longer at 60 million base pairs, and has a lower mutation rate. These features of the Y chromosome have slowed down the identification of its polymorphisms; as a consequence, they have reduced the accuracy of Y-chromosome mutation rate estimates.&lt;ref name="thomson"/&gt;

Methods of estimating the age of the Y-MRCA for a population of human males whose Y-chromosomes have been sequenced are based on applying the theories of [[molecular evolution]] to the [[Y chromosome]]. Unlike the [[autosomes]], the human Y-chromosome does not [[genetic recombination|recombine]] often with the [[X chromosome]] during [[meiosis]], but is usually transferred intact from father to son; however, it can recombine with the X chromosome in the pseudoautosomal regions at the ends of the Y chromosome. [[Mutation]]s occur periodically within the Y chromosome, and these mutations are passed on to males in subsequent generations.

These mutations can be used as markers to identify shared patrilineal relationships. Y chromosomes that share a specific mutation are referred to as [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|haplogroups]]. Y chromosomes within a specific haplogroup are assumed to share a common patrilineal ancestor who was the first to carry the defining mutation. (This assumption could be mistaken, as it is possible for the same mutation to occur more than once.) A family tree of Y chromosomes can be constructed, with the mutations serving as branching points along lineages. The Y-MRCA is positioned at the root of the family tree, as the Y chromosomes of all living males are descended from his Y chromosome.

Researchers can reconstruct ancestral Y chromosome DNA sequences by reversing mutated DNA segments to their original condition. The most likely original or ancestral state of a DNA sequence is determined by comparing human DNA sequences with those of a closely related species, usually non-human primates such as chimpanzees and gorillas. By reversing known mutations in a Y-chromosome lineage, a hypothetical ancestral sequence for the MRCA, Y-chromosomal Adam, can be inferred.

Determining the Y-MRCA's DNA sequence, and the time when he lived, involves identifying the human Y-chromosome lineages that are most divergent from each other—the lineages that share the fewest mutations with each other when compared to a non-human primate sequence in a [[phylogenetic tree]]. The common ancestor of the most divergent lineages is therefore the common ancestor of all lineages.

===History of estimates===
Early estimates of the age for the Y-MRCA published during the 1990s ranged between roughly 200 and 300 kya,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hammer MF |title=A recent common ancestry for human Y chromosomes |url= |journal= Nature |volume= 378 |issue= 6555 | pages=376–78 |year= 1995 |pmid= 7477371|doi=10.1038/378376a0|bibcode=1995Natur.378..376H }}

Such estimates were later substantially revised downward, as in Thomson ''et al.'' 2000,&lt;ref name="thomson"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recent common ancestry of human Y chromosomes: Evidence from DNA sequence data |year=2000|last=Thomson|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/97/13/7360.full|doi=10.1073/pnas.97.13.6927 |journal=PNAS|first1=J.|volume=97|issue=13|pages=6927–29|pmid=10860948|pmc=34361 |displayauthors=etal  |bibcode=2000PNAS...97.6927B}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed an age of about 59,000.
This date suggested that the Y-MRCA lived about 84,000 years after his female counterpart [[mt-MRCA]] (the matrilineal most recent common ancestor), who lived 150,000–200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/999030.stm |title=Genetic 'Adam never met Eve' |publisher=BBC News |date=2000-10-30 |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This date also meant that Y-chromosomal Adam lived at a time very close to, and possibly after, the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|migration from Africa]] which is believed to have taken place 50,000–80,000 years ago.
One explanation given for this discrepancy in the time depths of patrilineal vs. matrilineal lineages was that females have a better chance of reproducing than males due to the practice of [[polygyny]]. When a male individual has several wives, he has effectively prevented other males in the community from reproducing and passing on their Y chromosomes to subsequent generations. On the other hand, polygyny does not prevent most females in a community from passing on their mitochondrial DNA to subsequent generations. This differential reproductive success of males and females can lead to fewer male lineages relative to female lineages persisting into the future. These fewer male lineages are more sensitive to drift and would most likely [[Coalescent theory|coalesce]] on a more recent common ancestor. This would potentially explain the more recent dates associated with the Y-MRCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Fundamentals of Human Evolution|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=-r7qw54okwMC&amp;pg=PA180|title=Genes, Culture and Human Evolution|last=Stone|year=2007|isbn=1-4051-3166-7|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.psych.umn.edu/courses/spring10/mcguem/psy8937/readings/cavalli2007.pdf|title=Human Evolution and Its Relevance for Genetic Epidemiology|last=Cavalli-Sforza|year=2007|doi=10.1146/annurev.genom.8.080706.092403|first1=Luigi Luca|journal=Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics|volume=8|pages=1–15|pmid=17408354}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The "hyper-recent" estimate of significantly below 100 kya was again corrected upward in studies of the early 2010s, which ranged at about 120 kya to 160 kya.
This revision was due to the discovery of additional mutations and the rearrangement of the backbone of the Y-chromosome phylogeny following the resequencing of [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup A]] lineages.&lt;ref name="cell.com"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.05.002|title=A Revised Root for the Human Y Chromosomal Phylogenetic Tree: The Origin of Patrilineal Diversity in Africa|year=2011|last1=Cruciani|first1=Fulvio|last2=Trombetta|first2=Beniamino|last3=Massaia|first3=Andrea|last4=Destro-Bisol|first4=Giovanni|last5=Sellitto|first5=Daniele|last6=Scozzari|first6=Rosaria|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=88|issue=6|pages=814–18|pmid=21601174|pmc=3113241}}

Also in 2013, Poznik ''et al.'' reported the Y-MRCA to have lived between 120,000 and 156,000 years ago, based on [[genome sequencing]] of 69 men from 9 different populations.
In addition, the same study estimated the age of Mitochondrial Eve to about 99,000 and 148,000 years.&lt;ref name=unive&gt;{{cite web| author=University of Michigan Health System |title= The when and where of the Y: Research on Y chromosomes uncovers new clues about human ancestry|date=1 August 2013 | url= https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130801142148.htm |work= ScienceDaily |publisher= |accessdate= 10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these ranges overlap for a time-range of 28,000 years (148 to 120 kya), the results of this study have been cast in terms of the possibility that "Genetic Adam and Eve may have walked on Earth at the same time" in the popular press.&lt;ref name=cann/&gt;&lt;ref name=arstechnica&gt;{{cite web |author =Rathi A|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/08/genetic-adam-and-eve-may-have-walked-on-earth-at-the-same-time/|title= Genetic Adam and Eve may have walked on Earth at the same time| date= 2 August 2013|work= ars technica |publisher= Condé Nast|accessdate= 10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The announcement of yet another discovery of a previously unknown lineage, [[haplogroup A00]], in 2013, resulted in another shift in the estimate for the age of Y-chromosomal. Elhaik et al. (2014) dated it to between 163,900 and 260,200 years ago ([[95% confidence interval|95% CI]]).&lt;ref name=elhaik/&gt; Karmin et al. (2015) dated it to between 192,000 and 307,000 years ago ([[95% confidence interval|95% CI]]). The same study reports that non-African populations converge to a cluster of Y-MRCAs in a window close to 50kya ([[Recent African origin of modern humans|out-of-Africa migration]]), and an additional [[population bottleneck|bottleneck]] for non-African populations at about 10kya, interpreted as reflecting cultural changes increasing the variance in male reproductive success (i.e. increased [[social stratification]]) in the [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref name="bottleneck"/&gt;

==Family tree==
[[File:Haplogroup A tree.png|thumb|700px|center|The revised root of the y-chromosome family tree by Cruciani et al. 2011 compared with the family tree from Karafet et al. 2008. This has been further expanded by the discoveries published by Mendez et al. in 2013.]]

Initial sequencing (Karafet et al., 2008) of the human Y chromosome suggested that two most basal Y-chromosome lineages were [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup A]] and [[Haplogroup BT (Y-DNA)|Haplogroup BT]]. Haplogroup A is found at low frequencies in parts of Africa, but is common among certain hunter-gatherer groups. Haplogroup BT lineages represent the majority of African Y-chromosome lineages and virtually all non-African lineages.&lt;ref name="Karafet"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karafet TM, Mendez FL, Meilerman MB, Underhill PA, Zegura SL, Hammer MF |title=New binary polymorphisms reshape and increase resolution of the human Y chromosomal haplogroup tree |journal=Genome Research |year=2008 |volume=18  |pages=830–38 |doi=10.1101/gr.7172008 |url=http://www.genome.org/cgi/content/abstract/gr.7172008v1 |pmid=18385274 |issue=5 |pmc=2336805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Y-chromosomal Adam was represented as the root of these two lineages. Haplogroup A and Haplogroup BT represented the lineages of the two male descendants of Y-chromosomal Adam.

Cruciani et al. 2011, determined that the deepest split in the Y-chromosome tree was found between two previously reported subclades of Haplogroup A, rather than between Haplogroup A and Haplogroup BT.
Subclades A1b and A1a-T are now believed to descend directly from the root of the tree and now represent the lineages of Y-chromosomal Adam's two sons. The rearrangement of the Y-chromosome family tree implies that lineages classified as Haplogroup A do not necessarily form a [[monophyletic]] clade.&lt;ref name="Cruciani_2011"&gt;Fulvio Cruciani, Beniamino Trombetta, Andrea Massaia, Giovanni Destro-Biso, Daniele Sellitto y Rosaria Scozzari 2011, [http://www.cell.com/AJHG/fulltext/S0002-9297%2811%2900164-9# A Revised Root for the human Y-chromosomal Phylogenetic Tree: The Origin of Patrilineal Diversity in Africa]&lt;/ref&gt; Haplogroup A therefore refers to a collection of lineages that do not possess the markers that define Haplogroup BT, though Haplogroup A includes the most distantly related Y chromosomes.

The M91 and P97 mutations distinguish Haplogroup A from Haplogroup BT. Within Haplogroup A chromosomes, the M91 marker consists of a stretch of 8 [[Thymine|T nucleobase]] units. In Haplogroup BT and [[chimpanzee]] chromosomes, this marker consists of 9 T nucleobase units. This pattern suggested that the 9T stretch of Haplogroup BT was the ancestral version and that Haplogroup A was formed by the [[Deletion (genetics)|deletion]] of one [[nucleobase]]. Haplogroups A1b and A1a were considered subclades of Haplogroup A as they both possessed the M91 with 8Ts.&lt;ref name="Karafet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruciani_2011"/&gt;

But according to Cruciani et al. 2011, the region surrounding the M91 marker is a mutational hotspot prone to recurrent mutations. It is therefore possible that the 8T stretch of Haplogroup A may be the ancestral state of M91 and the 9T of Haplogroup BT may be the derived state that arose by an [[insertion (genetics)|insertion]] of 1T. This would explain why subclades A1b and A1a-T, the deepest branches of Haplogroup A, both possess the same version of M91 with 8Ts. Furthermore, Cruciani et al. 2011 determined that the P97 marker, which is also used to identify Haplogroup A, possessed the ancestral state in Haplogroup A but the derived state in Haplogroup BT.&lt;ref name="Cruciani_2011"/&gt;

==Likely geographic origin==
{{further information|Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)}}
As current estimates on TMRCA converge with estimates for the age of [[anatomically modern human]]s
and well predate the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa]] migration, geographical origin hypotheses continue to be limited to the [[Africa|African continent]].

According to Cruciani ''et al.'' 2011, the most basal lineages have been detected in [[West Africa|West]], [[Northwest Africa|Northwest]] and [[Central Africa]], suggesting  plausibility for the Y-MRCA living in the general region of "Central-Northwest Africa".&lt;ref&gt;In a sample of 2204 African Y-chromosomes, 8 chromosomes belonged to either haplogroup A1b or A1a. Haplogroup A1a was identified in two Moroccan Berbers, one Fulbe, and one Tuareg person from Niger. Haplogroup A1b was identified in three Bakola pygmies from Southern Cameroon and one Algerian Berber. Cruciani ''et al.'' 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Scozzari ''et al.'' (2012) agreed with a plausible placement in "the north-western quadrant of the African continent" for the emergence of the A1b haplogroup.
&lt;ref&gt;"the hypothesis of an origin in the north-western quadrant of the African continent for the A1b haplogroup, and, together with recent findings of ancient Y-lineages in central-western Africa, provide new evidence regarding the geographical origin of human MSY diversity". {{cite journal|author=Scozzari R |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0049170|title=Molecular Dissection of the Basal Clades in the Human Y Chromosome Phylogenetic Tree|year=2012|editor1-last=Caramelli|editor1-first=David|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=7|issue=11|pages=e49170|pmid=23145109|pmc=3492319|author-separator= |author2= Massaia A |author3= D'Atanasio E |author4= Myres NM |author5= Perego UA  |displayauthors=etal  |bibcode=2012PLoSO...749170S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 report of [[haplogroup A00]] found among the [[Mbo people (Cameroon)|Mbo people]] of western present-day [[Cameroon]] is also compatible with this picture.&lt;ref name="Mendez13"/&gt;

The revision of Y-chromosomal phylogeny since 2011 has affected estimates for the likely geographical origin of Y-MRCA as well as estimates on time depth. By the same reasoning, future discovery of presently-unknown archaic haplogroups in living people would again lead to such revisions. In particular, the possible presence of between 1% and 4% [[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|Neanderthal-derived DNA]] in Eurasian genomes implies that the (unlikely) event of a discovery of a single living Eurasian male exhibiting a Neanderthal patrilineal line would immediately push back T-MRCA ("time to MRCA") to at least twice its current estimate. However, the discovery of a neanderthal Y-chromosome by Mendez ''et al''.&lt;ref name="Mendez2016"/&gt; suggests the extinction of neanderthal patrilineages, as the lineage inferred from the neanderthal sequence is outside of the range of [[anatomically modern humans|contemporary human]] genetic variation. Questions of geographical origin would become part of the debate on Neanderthal evolution from ''[[Homo erectus]]''.
