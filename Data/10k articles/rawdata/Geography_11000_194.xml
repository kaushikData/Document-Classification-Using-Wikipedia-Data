The '''71st parallel north''' is a [[circle of latitude]] that is 71 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] [[true north|north]] of the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[equator|equatorial plane]], in the [[Arctic]]. It crosses the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]], and passes through some of the southern seas of the [[Arctic Ocean]].

At this latitude the [[sun]] is visible for 24 hours, 0 minutes during the [[summer solstice]] and Civil Twilight during the [[winter solstice]].

==Around the world==
Starting at the [[Prime Meridian]] and heading eastwards, the parallel 71° north passes through:

'''Ammassalik wooden maps''' are carved, tactile maps of the [[Greenland]]ic coastlines. In the 1880s, [[Gustav Frederik Holm|Gustav Holm]] led an expedition to the Ammassalik coast of eastern [[Greenland]], where he met several [[Tunumiit]], or Eastern Greenland [[Inuit]] communities, who had had no prior direct contact with Europeans. He returned to Denmark with a set of three-dimensional wooden maps of the coast around {{coord|66|-36|dim:100000|display=inline,title}}, carved by a native of [[Umivik, Ammassalik|Umivik]] named Kunit.

==History==
Kunit approached Holm on February 8, 1885 and sold the maps representing the coast from [[Sermiligaaq|Sermiligak]] to Kangerdlugsuatsiak. Kunit returned on March 21 with another piece representing the peninsula between Sermiligak and Kangerdluarsikajik.{{sfn|Holm|1886|p=104}}

Upon Holm's return, the maps were deposited along with the rest of the collection at the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]]. As of 1948 the maps were still in Copenhagen; copies were deposited in the [[Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro]] in [[Paris]].{{sfn|Bagrow|1948|p=92}} At some point the maps were transferred to the [[Greenland National Museum]] in [[Nuuk]], which was established in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.natmus.gl/Forsiden/tabid/80/language/en-US/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Woodward|Lewis|1998}} write that the "only other known example" of such a map is a specimen at the [[Michigan State University]] museum — item 896.7, 62154 — which is probably a copy of Kunit's work.{{sfn|Woodward|Lewis|1998|p=168}}

In 2000, [[Post Greenland]] issued a stamp designed by [[Anne-Birthe Hove]] featuring the coastal map, as part of its "Greenland's Cultural Heritage" series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danstopicals.com/woodmap.htm http://www.stamps.gl/uk/info/kunstnere/Anne_Birthe_Hove/annebirthehove.htm{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Greenland National Museum loaned out the maps for a 2007-8 exhibition at the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]] entitled ''Maps: Finding Our Place in the World'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldmuseum.org/maps/about.asp |title=Maps: Finding Our Place in the World: All About Maps |work=fieldmuseum.org |accessdate=2009-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317200556/http://www.fieldmuseum.org/maps/about.asp |archivedate=2009-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which also traveled to the [[Walters Art Museum]] in [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewalters.org/exhibits/maps/image_pages/inuit.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722174154/http://thewalters.org/exhibits/maps/image_pages/inuit.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anton Mohr''' (8 February 1890&amp;nbsp;– 14 September 1968) was a Norwegian geographer and historian.

He was born in [[Fana (municipality)|Fana]] to merchant and consul [[Conrad Mohr]] and Agnete Kroepelien, and was a brother of [[Wilhelm Mohr (born 1886)|Wilhelm Mohr]]. He was a central person in the establishment of the [[Norwegian School of Economics]], and was appointed professor of political history at the institution from 1946 to 60. His works include his thesis ''Kampen om Nilen'' from 1923, ''Kampen om oljen'' from 1925, ''Norges Kornforsyning inntil 1914'' from 1954, and ''De 50 statene'' (1959). He wrote three books on the [[Napoleonic era]], ''Keiseren av Elba'', ''De hundrede dager'' and  ''Mot Sankt Helena''. He was decorated Knight, First Class of the [[Order of St. Olav]] in 1960, and was a Commander of the [[Order of the Crown of Italy]] and Knight of the French [[Legion of Honour]].&lt;ref name=hvem68&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1968|title=Mohr, Anton |encyclopedia=[[Hvem er hvem?]]|editor=Steenstrup, Bjørn|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Brunton.JPG|thumb|300px|A standard Brunton Geo [[compass]], used commonly by geologists and surveyors to obtain a bearing in the field.]]
In [[navigation]], '''bearing''' is the horizontal angle between the direction of an object and another object, or between it and that of true north.

''Absolute bearing'' refers to the angle between the magnetic North (magnetic bearing) or true North (true bearing) and an object. For example, an object to the East would have an absolute bearing of 90 degrees. 
''Relative bearing'' refers to the angle between the craft's forward direction, and the location of another object. For example, an object relative bearing of 0 degrees would be dead ahead; an object relative bearing 180 degrees would be behind.&lt;ref&gt;Rutstrum, Carl, ''The Wilderness Route Finder'', University of Minnesota Press (2000), {{ISBN|0-8166-3661-3}}, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Bearings can be measured in [[Angular mil|mils]] or degrees.

==Some specific usages==

===US Army definition===
The US Army defines the ''bearing'' from Point A to Point B as the angle between a [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|ray]] in the direction of north or south, whose origin is Point A, and Ray AB, the ray whose origin is Point A and which contains Point B. The bearing consists of 2 characters and 1 number:  first, the character is either N or S. Next is the angle value. Third, the character representing the direction of the angle away from the reference ray - thus,  either E, or W. The angle value will always be less than 90 degrees.&lt;ref name="U.S. Army, 1941 pp. 24-25" /&gt;  For example, if Point B is located exactly southeast of Point A, the bearing from Point A to Point B is S 45° E.&lt;ref name="U.S. Army 1956 pp. 69-70"&gt;U.S. Army, Map Reading and Land Navigation, FM 21-26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (28 March 1956), ch. 3, pp. 69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Army defines the ''[[azimuth]]'' between Point A and Point B as the angle, measured in the clockwise direction, between the north reference ray and Ray AB.  For example, if the bearing between Point A and Point B is S 45° E, the azimuth between Point A and Point B is 135°.&lt;ref name="U.S. Army, 1941 pp. 24-25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="U.S. Army 1956 pp. 69-70"/&gt; The angle value in a bearing can be specified in the units of [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], [[Angular mil|mils]], or [[grad (angle)|grad]].  An azimuth is specified in the same angle units.&lt;ref name="U.S. Army, 1941 pp. 24-25"&gt;U.S. Army, ''Advanced Map and Aerial Photograph Reading'', Headquarters, War Department, Washington, D.C. (17 September 1941), pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

A bearing can be taken on another vessel to aid piloting. If the two vessels are travelling towards each other and the relative bearing remains the same over time, there is likelihood of collision and action needs to be taken by one or both vessels to prevent this from happening.

===Warfare===
A bearing can be taken to a fixed or moving object in order to target it with gunfire or missiles. This is mainly used by ground troops when planning on using an air-strike on the target.

===Search and rescue===
A bearing can be taken to a person or vessel in distress in order to go to their aid.

==Other terminology sometimes used==

Types of bearings include:
* compass bearings
* grid bearings
* magnetic bearings
* relative bearings
* true bearings

A ''true bearing'' is measured in relation to the fixed horizontal reference plane of [[true north]], that is, using the direction toward the [[geographic north pole]] as a reference point, while a ''magnetic bearing'' is measured in relation to [[magnetic north]], that is in relation to the north direction of the Earth's magnetic field lines at the given location. The latter is not the same as the direction toward the [[magnetic north pole]] due to [[magnetic anomalies]].

A ''[[grid north|grid bearing]]'' is measured in relation to the fixed horizontal reference plane of [[grid north]], that is, using the direction northwards along the grid lines of the [[map projection]] as a reference point, while a ''compass bearing'', as in vehicle or marine navigation, is measured in relation to the [[magnetic compass]] of the navigator's vehicle or vessel (if aboard ship). It should be very close to the magnetic bearing. The difference between a magnetic bearing and a compass bearing is the [[magnetic deviation|deviation]] caused to the compass by [[ferrous]] metals and local magnetic fields generated by any variety of vehicle or shipboard sources (steel vehicle bodies/frames or vessel hulls, ignition systems, etc.)

A ''relative bearing'' is one in which the reference direction is straight ahead, where the bearing is measured relative to the direction the navigator is facing (on land) or in relation to the vessel's bow (aboard ship).

==Bearing measurement==
[[File:Bearing and azimuth along the geodesic.png|thumb|The bearing between [[Cape Town]] and [[Melbourne]] along the [[geodesic]] (the shortest route) changes from 141° to 42°. [[Orthographic projections in cartography|Azimuthal orthographic projection]] and [[Miller cylindrical projection]].]]
There are several methods used to measure navigation bearings including:
#In land navigation, a 'bearing' is ordinarily calculated in a [[clockwise]] direction starting from a reference direction of 0° and increasing to 359.9 degrees.&lt;ref name="Keay, pp. 133-134"&gt;Keay, pp. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt;  Measured in this way, a bearing is referred to as an ''[[azimuth]]'' by the US Army but not by armies in other English speaking nations, which use the term bearing.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army, ''Map Reading and Land Navigation'', FM 21-26, Headquarters, Dept. of the Army, Washington, D.C. (7 May 1993), ch. 6, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  If the reference direction is north (either [[true north]], [[magnetic north]], or [[grid north]]), the bearing is termed an ''absolute bearing''.  In a contemporary land navigation context, true, magnetic, and grid bearings are always measured in this way, with true north, magnetic north, or grid north being 0° in a 360-degree system.&lt;ref name="Keay, pp. 133-134" /&gt;
#In aircraft navigation, an angle is normally measured from the aircraft's track or heading, in a clockwise direction. If the aircraft encounters a target that is not ahead of the aircraft and not on an identical track, then the angular bearing to that target is called a ''relative bearing''.{{clarify|date=May 2016|Track and heading are not usually the same number due to wind}}{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
#In marine navigation, [[starboard]] bearings are 'green' and [[Port (nautical)|port]] bearings are 'red'. Thus, in ship navigation, a target directly off the starboard side would be 'Green090' or 'G090'.&lt;ref&gt;This method is used by the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Royal Australian Navy]] in accordance with the ''Admiralty Manual of Navigation'', BR45.&lt;/ref&gt;  This method is only used for a ''relative bearing''.  A navigator on watch does not always have a corrected compass available with which to give an accurate bearing. If available, the bearing might not be numerate. Therefore, every forty-five degrees of direction from north on the compass was divided into four 'points'. Thus, 32 points of 11.25° each makes a circle of 360°. An object at 022.5° relative would be 'two points off the starboard bow', an object at 101.25° relative would be 'one point abaft the starboard beam' and an object at 213.75° relative would be 'three points on the port quarter'. This method is only used for a ''relative bearing''.
#An informal method of measuring a ''relative bearing'' is by using the 'clock method'. In this method, the direction a vessel, aircraft or object is measured as if a clock face is laid over the vessel or aircraft, with the number twelve pointing forward. Something straight ahead is at 'twelve o'clock', while something directly off to the right is at 'three o'clock'. This method is only used for a relative bearing.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
#In land [[surveying]], a '''bearing''' is the clockwise or counterclockwise angle between north or south and a direction. For example, bearings are recorded as N57°E, S51°E, S21°W, N87°W, or N15°W. In surveying, bearings can be referenced to true north, magnetic north, grid north (the Y axis of a map projection), or a previous map, which is often a historical magnetic north.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Usage===
{{unreferenced section|date = May 2016}}
If navigating by [[gyrocompass]], the reference direction is [[true north]], in which case the terms ''[[true bearing]]'' and '' [[geodetic bearing]]'' are used.  In [[stellar navigation]], the reference direction is that of the [[North Star]], [[Polaris]]. Generalizing this to two angular dimensions, a '''bearing''' is the combination of antenna [[azimuth]] and [[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] required to point (aim) an antenna in a given direction. The bearing for [[geostationary satellite]]s is constant. The bearing for polar-orbiting satellites varies continuously.
[[File:Polar bear bearing.svg|thumb|upright|'''A''' and '''B''' are near the North Pole and facing each other. Though '''A''' is facing east, '''B''' is ''not'' facing west. If '''B''' were to face west, her direction (dashed arrow) would be tangential to her latitude circle (dashed circle). Only on the equator is it true that if '''A''' faces east and '''B''' faces west that they can face each other.]]
Moving from A to B along a [[great circle]] can be considered as always going in the same direction (the direction of B), but not in the sense of keeping the same bearing, which applies when following a [[rhumb line]].  Accordingly, the direction at A of B, expressed as a bearing, is not in general the opposite of the direction at B of A (when traveling on the great circle formed by A and B). For example, assume A and B in the northern hemisphere have the same latitude, and at A the direction to B is east-northeast. Then going from A to B, one arrives at B with the direction east-southeast, and conversely, the direction at B of A is west-northwest.

Bearings can also be transmitted in to NNE-North North East NNNE-North North North east and ENNE-East North North East.

The '''Bishop of Portsmouth''' is the [[Ordinary (officer)|Ordinary]] of the [[Church of England]] [[Anglican Diocese of Portsmouth|Diocese of Portsmouth]] in the [[Province of Canterbury]].

The diocese covers south-east [[Hampshire]] and the [[Isle of Wight]] and has its [[Episcopal see|see]] in the [[Portsmouth|City of Portsmouth]], where the [[Cathedra|seat]] is located at the [[Portsmouth Cathedral|Cathedral Church of Saint Thomas of Canterbury]] which was elevated to cathedral status in 1927. The bishop's residence is Bishopsgrove, [[Fareham]].

The office of bishop was created in 1927 when the new diocese was formed from part of the [[Diocese of Winchester]]. The current bishop is the Right Reverend [[Christopher Foster (bishop)|Christopher Foster]], the 9th Bishop of Portsmouth, who signs ''+ Christopher Portsmouth''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15426">'''Chinese exploration''' includes exploratory [[History of China|Chinese]] travels abroad, on land and by sea, from the 2nd century BC until the 15th century.

== Land exploration ==
=== Pamir Mountains and beyond ===
[[File:ZhangQianTravel.jpg|thumb|300px|Countries described in [[Zhang Qian]]'s report (visited countries are highlighted in blue).]]
{{Further|History of the Han Dynasty|Sino-Roman relations|Daqin}}

The [[Han Dynasty|Han]] [[envoy (title)|envoy]] [[Zhang Qian]] traveled beyond the [[Tarim Basin]] in the 2nd century BC, introducing the Chinese to the kingdoms of [[Central Asia]], [[Seleucid Empire|Hellenized Persia]], [[India]], and the [[Middle East]].

From 104 to 102 BC, [[Emperor Wu of Han]] waged war against the "[[Yuezhi]]" who controlled "[[Dayuan]]", a [[Hellenized]] kingdom of [[Fergana]] established by [[Alexander the Great]] in 329 BC.

[[Gan Ying]], the emissary of General [[Ban Chao]], perhaps traveled as far as [[Roman Syria]] in the late 1st century AD. After these initial discoveries, the focus of Chinese exploration shifted to the [[Maritime trade|maritime]] sphere, although the [[Silk Road]] leading all the way to [[Europe]] continued to be China's most lucrative source of trade.

The pilgrimage of the Buddhist monk [[Xuanzang]] from [[Chang'an]] to [[Nalanda]] in India not only greatly increased the knowledge of [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhism in China]] {{ndash}} returning more than 650 texts including the [[Heart Sutra|Heart]] and the [[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra|Perfection of Wisdom Sutra]]s {{ndash}} and inspired the immensely influential novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''. It also led to Xuanzang's publication of the ''[[Great Tang Records on the Western Regions]]'', a text which introduced China to Indian cities such as the port of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and recorded many details of 7th-century Bengal for posterity.

== Maritime exploration ==
=== South China Sea ===
Before the advent of the Chinese-invented [[mariner's compass]] in the 11th century, the seasonal [[monsoon]] winds controlled navigation, blowing north from the equatorial zone in the summer and south in the winter.&lt;ref name="fairbank 191"/&gt; This most likely accounts for the ease in which [[Neolithic]] travelers from mainland China could settle on the island of [[Taiwan]] in prehistoric times.&lt;ref name="fairbank 191"/&gt; After defeating the last of the [[Warring States]] and consolidating an empire over [[China proper]], the Chinese navy of the [[Qin Dynasty]] period (221–207 BC) assisted the land-borne invasion of [[Guangzhou]] and northern [[Vietnam]]. (Called first [[Jiaozhi]] and then [[Annam (Chinese Province)|Annam]],&lt;ref name="fairbank 191"&gt;Fairbank, 191.&lt;/ref&gt; the northern half of Vietnam would not become fully independent from Chinese rule until AD 938.) In 1975, an ancient shipyard excavated in Guangzhou was dated to the early [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC {{ndash}} AD 220) and, with three platforms, was able to construct ships that were approximately 30&amp;nbsp;m (98&amp;nbsp;ft) in length, 8&amp;nbsp;m (26&amp;nbsp;ft) in width, and could hold a weight of 60 metric tons.&lt;ref name="wang 1982 122"&gt;Wang (1982), 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Three Kingdoms]], travellers from [[Eastern Wu]] are known to have explored the coast. The most important were [[Zhu Ying]] (朱應) and [[Kang Tai]], both sent by the Governor of Guangzhou and Jiaozhi [[Lu Dai|Lü Dai]] in the early 3rd century. Although each wrote a book, both were lost by the 11th century: Zhu's ''Record of the Curiosities of [[Kingdom of Funan|Phnom]]'' (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|扶南異物誌}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|扶南异物志}}, ''Fúnán Yìwù Zhì'') in its entirety and Kang's ''Tales of Foreign Countries During the Wu Period'' (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|吳時外國傳}}, &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|zh|吴时外国传}}, ''Wúshí Wàiguó Zhuàn'') only surviving in scattered references in other works,&lt;ref name="hsu"&gt;Hsu Yun-ts'iao. "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=08b6HCoCCaAC Notes Relating to Admiral Cheng Ho's Expeditions]" in ''Admiral Zheng He &amp; Southeast Asia''. Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2005. Accessed 18 Oct 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; including the ''Shuijing Zhu'' and the ''[[Yiwen Leiju]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sun 1989, pp. 191–193&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during the [[Eastern Jin]], a rebel known as Lu Xun managed to fend off an attack by the imperial army for a hundred days in 403 before sailing down into the [[South China Sea]] from a coastal commandery. For six years, he occupied [[Panyu]], the largest southern seaport of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Sun 1989, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South East Asia ===
Between the 15th and 18th centuries, much of South-east Asia was explored by Chinese merchants. Some parts of Malaysia were settled by Chinese families at this time, and Chinese garrisons established&lt;ref&gt;https://journals.openedition.org/archipel/280&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly,some Chinese traders settled in north Java in the 1400s, and after China legitimized foreign trade again in 1567 (licensing 50 junks a year), hundreds of Chinese trade colonies developed in what is now Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt; Reid, Anthony (1999), "Chinese and Southeast Asian interactions", in Pan, Lynn, ''The Encyclopedia of the Chinese Overseas'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, pp. 51–53, {{ISBN|978-0-674-25210-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indian Ocean and beyond ===

Chinese envoys sailed into the [[Indian Ocean]] from the late 2nd century BC, and reportedly reached [[Kanchipuram]], known as ''Huangzhi'' (黄支) to them,&lt;ref&gt;Sun 1989, pp. 161–167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chen 2002, pp. 67–71&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise [[Ethiopia]] as asserted by Ethiopian scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cy.revues.org/document33.html ''A Chinese in the Nubian and Abyssinian Kingdoms (8th century)''], Wolbert Smidt.
&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 4th and early 5th centuries, Chinese pilgrims like [[Faxian]], Zhiyan, and Tanwujie began traveling by sea to [[India]], bringing back Buddhist scriptures and [[sutra]]s to China.&lt;ref&gt;Sun 1989, pp. 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; By the 7th century as many as 31 recorded Chinese monks including [[I Ching (monk)|I Ching]] managed to reach India the same way. In 674 the private explorer Daxi Hongtong was among the first to end his journey at the southern tip of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], after traveling through 36 countries west of the South China Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Sun 1989, pp. 316–321&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese seafaring merchants and diplomats of the medieval [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) and [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) often sailed into the Indian Ocean after visiting ports in [[South East Asia]]. Chinese sailors would travel to [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]], India, Sri Lanka, into the [[Persian Gulf]] and up the [[Euphrates]] River in modern-day [[Iraq]], to the [[Arabia]]n peninsula and into the [[Red Sea]], stopping to trade goods in Ethiopia and [[Egypt]] (as Chinese [[porcelain]] was highly valued in old [[Fustat]], [[Cairo]]).&lt;ref name="bowman 104 105"&gt;Bowman, 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Jia Dan]] wrote ''Route between Guangzhou and the Barbarian Sea'' during the late 8th century that documented foreign communications, the book was lost, but the ''[[Xin Tangshu]]'' retained some of his passages about the three sea-routes linking China to [[East Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Sun, pp. 310–314&lt;/ref&gt; Jia Dan also wrote about tall [[lighthouse]] [[minaret]]s in the [[Persian Gulf]], which were confirmed a century later by [[Ali al-Masudi]] and [[al-Muqaddasi]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 661"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 661.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the initial work of Jia Dan, other Chinese writers accurately described Africa from the 9th century onwards; For example, [[Duan Chengshi]] wrote in 863 of the [[Somali slave trade|slave trade]], [[ivory trade]], and [[ambergris]] trade of [[Berbera]], [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="levathes 38"&gt;Levathes, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seaport]]s in China such as [[Guangzhou]] and [[Quanzhou]] – the most [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] urban centers in the medieval world – hosted thousands of foreign travelers and permanent settlers. Chinese [[junk (ship)|junk]] ships were even described by the Moroccan geographer [[Al-Idrisi]] in his ''Geography'' of 1154, along with the usual goods they traded and carried aboard their vessels.&lt;ref name="shen 159 161"&gt;Shen, 159–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ShenDuGiraffePainting.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[giraffe]] brought from [[Somalia]] in the twelfth year of Yongle (1414)]]

From 1405 to 1433, large fleets commanded by Admiral [[Zheng He]] – under the auspices of the [[Yongle Emperor]] of the [[Ming Dynasty]] – [[Ming treasure voyages|traveled to the Indian Ocean seven times]].  This attempt did not lead China to global expansion, as the Confucian bureaucracy under the next emperor reversed the policy of open exploration and by 1500, it became a capital offence to build a seagoing junk with more than two masts.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|last1=Ronan|first1=Colin|last2=Needham|first2=Joseph|title=The shorter Science and Civilisation in China|year=1986|volume=3|page=147|publisher=C.U.P.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese merchants became content trading with already existing tributary states nearby and abroad. To them, traveling far east into the [[Pacific Ocean]] represented entering a broad wasteland of water with uncertain benefits of trade.

== Technique ==
In China, the invention of the [[stern]]-mounted [[rudder]] appeared as early as the 1st century AD, allowing for better [[steering]] than using the power of [[oar]]smen. The [[Cao Wei]] Kingdom engineer and inventor [[Ma Jun]] (c. 200–265 AD) built the first [[south-pointing chariot]], a complex mechanical device that incorporated a [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gear in order to navigate on land, and (as one 6th century text alludes) by sea as well.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 40"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 287 288"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 287–288&lt;/ref&gt; Much later the Chinese polymath scientist [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095 AD) was the first to describe the [[magnetic]] needle-[[compass]], along with its usefulness for accurate navigation by discovering the concept of [[true north]].&lt;ref name="bowman 599"&gt;Bowman, 599.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sivin III 22"&gt;Sivin, III, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Pingzhou Table Talks'' of 1119 AD the Song Dynasty maritime author [[Zhu Yu (author)|Zhu Yu]] described the use of [[bulkhead (partition)|separate bulkhead compartments]] in the [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] of Chinese ships.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 463"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 463.&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed for water-tight conditions and ability of a ship not to sink if one part of the hull became damaged.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 463"/&gt;

'''DR-12''', better known as la '''Carretera de Constanza''', is a signed highway in the [[Dominican Republic]], part of the national highway system. DR-12 connects the main highway of the Republic, [[DR-1]], with the middle sized town of [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]]. Recently renovated, DR-12 is the only connection to the fertile valley of Constanza which is high in the [[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]. It was recently renovated in 2010. It is widely known for the natural beauty that surrounds it and also for the dangers of driving in it.

'''Franciszek Florian Czaki''' (Csaky de Kerestszegh) (died in 1772) – a famous [[cartographer]], engineer, [[Captain (land)|capitan]] of the Polish [[artillery]], Hungarian by nationality. 
One of the most prominent cartographers of the last Polish king [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] (since 1765). In (1772), he made a set of 24 detailed maps of Poland scaled 1:629 000 ''"Carte de Pologne..."'', planned several canals in [[Poland]] and in [[Lithuania]], including the [[Dnieper-Bug Canal|Królewski Canal]] (en: Royal Canal).

The '''''Espérance''''' was a [[Rhône class scow|''Rhône'' class scow]] of the [[French Navy]], launched in 1781 and later reclassified as a frigate. She earned fame as one of the ships of [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]]'s expedition. The Australian town of [[Esperance, Western Australia|Esperance]] and [[Esperance Bay]] were named after her. She was sold for breaking up in 1794.

== Career ==
''Espérance'' was built as ''Durance'' and served in [[François Joseph Paul de Grasse|de Grasse]]'s squadron as a troopship. On 18 December 1782, she departed Toulon with the frigates [[French frigate Précieuse (1778)|''Précieuse'']] and [[French frigate Prosélyte (1786)|''Prosélyte'']], and the corvette [[French corvette Poulette (1781)|''Poulette'']], in a convoy bound for the Caribbean, that also included the [[fluyt]]s [[French frigate Gracieuse (1751)|''Gracieuse'']] and [[French fluyt Rhône (1781)|''Rhône'']].&lt;ref name="roche359"&gt;Roche, p.359&lt;/ref&gt;

A decade later, on 29 September 1791, ''Espérance''under Captain [[Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec|Huon de Kermadec]], and [[French ship Recherche (1787)|''Recherche'']] sailed from Brest to New Caledonia. They were on a mission under the command of Admiral d'Entrecasteaux in search of the explorer [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse#Rescue mission of D'Entrecasteaux|Lapérouse]]. The mission was unsuccessful: it was not until 1826 that the mystery of [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse#Discovery of the expedition|Laperouse's disappearance]] was solved.

==Fate==
On 28 October 1793, the Dutch captured ''Espérance'' at [[Surabaya]]. However, they restored her to France in February 1794. In September, she was sold to Holland, and two months later she was sold for scrap.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2494">'''Geographic contiguity''' is the characteristic in [[geography]] of political or geographical land divisions, as a group, not being interrupted by other land or water. Such divisions are referred to as being ''contiguous.''  In the [[United States]], for example, the "[[Contiguous United States|48 contiguous states]]" excludes [[Hawaii]] and [[Alaska]], which do not share borders with other [[U.S. state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wetlandsfws.er.usgs.gov/imf/sites/NWI_CONUS/CONUS_metadata/CONUS_Layers.html Wetlands Metadata for the Lower 48 States, US Fish and Wildlife Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105143231/http://wetlandsfws.er.usgs.gov/imf/sites/NWI_CONUS/CONUS_metadata/CONUS_Layers.html |date=5 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of geographical contiguity might include the "contiguous European Union" excluding member states such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Malta and Cyprus (these being non-contiguous), or the "contiguous United Kingdom" referring to all parts of the country excepting Northern Ireland (it being geographically non-contiguous).

Two or more contiguous [[Municipality|municipalities]] can be consolidated into one, or one municipality can consist of many noncontiguous elements. For example, the [[Financially Distressed Municipalities Act]] allows the commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] to merge contiguous municipalities to reduce [[financial distress]].

Geographic contiguity is important in [[biology]], especially [[range (biology)|animal ranges]]. For a particular species, its habitat may be a '[[contiguous range]]', or it might be broken, requiring periodic, typically seasonal migrations (see: [[Disjunct distribution]]). The same concept of contiguous range is true for human transportation studies in an attempt to understand census geography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Reference/COGG/LongDescription_e.cfm?GEO_LEVEL=5&amp;REFCODE=1&amp;LANG=E Census Metropolitan Area, Statistics Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217115704/http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Reference/COGG/LongDescription_e.cfm?GEO_LEVEL=5&amp;REFCODE=1&amp;LANG=E |date=17 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also comes into play with electoral geography and politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/3/217 The Electoral Geography of Weimar Germany: Exploratory Spatial Data Analyses of Protestant Support for the Nazi Party, by John O'Loughlin]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Un-mali.png|thumb|400px|A map of Mali]]
[[File:LocationMali.svg|thumb|Location of Mali]]

'''[[Mali]]''' is a landlocked nation in [[West Africa]], located southwest of [[Algeria]], extending south-west from the southern [[Sahara Desert]] through the [[Sahel]] to the [[Sudan (region)|Sudanian savanna]] zone. Mali's size is 1,240,192 square kilometers.

Desert or semi-desert covers about 65 percent of Mali's total area (1,240,192 square kilometers). The Niger River creates a large and fertile [[Inner Niger Delta|inland delta]] as it arcs northeast through Mali from Guinea before turning south and eventually emptying into the Gulf of Guinea.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Mali.pdf Mali country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (January 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory encompasses three natural zones: the southern cultivated Sudanese zone, central semi-desert Sahelian zone, and northern desert Saharan zone. The terrain is primarily savanna in the south and flat to rolling plains or high plateau (200–500 meters in elevation) in the north. There are rugged hills in the northeast, with elevations of up to 1,000 meters.

The Niger (with 1,693 kilometers in Mali) and Senegal are Mali’s two largest rivers. The Niger is generally described as Mali’s lifeblood, a source of food, drinking water, irrigation, and transportation.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

The country's lowest point is on the [[Senegal River]] (23 m) and its highest point is [[Hombori Tondo]] (1155 m).

==Climate==
[[File:Mali map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Mali map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Mali is one of the hottest countries in the world. The [[thermal equator]], which matches the hottest spots year-round on the planet based on the mean daily annual temperature, crosses the country&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Mali.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Mali receives negligible rainfall and [[drought]]s are very frequent&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/&gt; Late June to early December is the rainy season in the southernmost area. During this time, flooding of the Niger River is common, creating the [[Inner Niger Delta]]. The vast northern desert part of Mali has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') with long, extremely hot summers and scarce rainfall which decreases northwards. The central area has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSh'') with very high temperatures year-round, a long, intense dry season and a brief, irregular rainy season. The little southern band possesses a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw'') very high temperatures year-round with a dry season and a rainy season.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; During the hottest season of the year, temperatures are high throughout the country. [[Timbuktu]], [[Taoudenni]], [[Araouane]], [[Gao]], [[Kidal]], [[Tessalit]] are some of the hottest spots on Earth during their warmest months. Kayes, with an average high temperature of about 44° (111.2°) in April is nicknamed "the pressure cooker of Africa" due to his extreme heat year-round. The heat is more extreme to the north in the [[Sahara Desert]]; the maximum average high temperature of the year reaches 46&amp;nbsp;°C (114.8&amp;nbsp;°F) in Araouane in June&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.fr/books?id=cHRHH7_minUC&amp;pg=PA411&amp;dq=Araouan+%C3%A0+sa+limite+sud-est&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8CNCVYGuMdPLaO-CgPgL&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Araouan%20%C3%A0%20sa%20limite%20sud-est&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and comes close to 48° (118.4°) in the Taoudenni region during July&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.fr/books?id=0K8sAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Sahara+climate+amplitude+Bilma&amp;dq=Sahara+climate+amplitude+Bilma&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LKM8VcHdCtfhaviNgJAI&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBw&lt;/ref&gt; [[sunshine duration]] is high in Mali, reaching the highest levels in the northern arid zone with about 3,600 - 3,700 h a year. Mali has overall a hot, sunny and dry climate dominated by the [[subtropical ridge]].

==Geology==
[[File:Mali geologic map.png|thumb|350px|Mali [[geologic map]]]]
[[Image:Mali Topography.png|thumb|350px|Mali's topography.]]

Geologically, Mali consists mostly of vast flatlands of [[granite]] and [[shale]] covered by [[sandstone]] and alluvial [[quartz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Mali|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Africa South of the Sahara|volume=3|editor=John Middleton|year=1997|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mali extends over two main geological structures, the [[West African craton]] in the west and the [[Tuareg shield]] in the southeast, which came together at the end of the [[Precambrian]] era between 600 and 550 million years ago. The suture zone is to the west of the [[Adrar des Ifoghas]] mountains.&lt;ref name="Imrich Kusnir 1999"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://actamont.tuke.sk/pdf/1999/n4/6k.pdf|title=Gold in Mali|author=Imrich Kusnir|publisher=Acta Montanistica Slovaca|accessdate=2009-03-14|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying rocks of the West African craton are covered in the northwest by sediments of the [[Taoudeni basin]], with two main outcrops of crystalline rocks in the northern Reguibat shield in [[Mauritania]] and the southern Leo shield which includes the [[Bougouni]] and [[Kenieba]] outcrops, both of which contain valuable minerals.&lt;ref name="Imrich Kusnir 1999"/&gt; There may also be petroleum reserves in the Taoudeni basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://energy.ihs.com/NR/rdonlyres/1CD17E04-0687-4853-A22B-190CC53BDFE3/0/NAPE0807_nogravmag.pdf|title=Taoudeni Basin,OnshoreMali &amp; Mauritania|publisher=IHS|accessdate=2009-03-14|date=August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Borders ==
Mali shares a total of 7,243 kilometers (4,500 miles) of land boundaries with seven bordering states: 
'''North and northeast''': [[Algeria]]- 1,376&amp;nbsp;km/855&amp;nbsp;mi
'''East''': [[Niger]]- 821&amp;nbsp;km/510&amp;nbsp;mi
'''Southeast''': [[Burkina Faso]]- 1,000&amp;nbsp;km/621&amp;nbsp;mi
'''South''': [[Ivory Coast]]- 532&amp;nbsp;km/330&amp;nbsp;mi
'''Southwest''': [[Guinea]]- 858&amp;nbsp;km/533&amp;nbsp;mi
'''West''': [[Senegal]] &amp; [[Mauritania]]- 419&amp;nbsp;km/260&amp;nbsp;mi &amp; 2,237&amp;nbsp;km/1390&amp;nbsp;mi (respectively)

==Natural resources==
Mali is endowed with bauxite, copper, diamonds, gold, Granite, gypsum, iron ore, kaolin, limestone, [[lithium]], manganese, phosphates, salt, silver, uranium, and zinc. Not all deposits are being exploited, and some may not be commercially viable. Mali also has ample hydropower.

==Land use==
Sixty-five percent of Mali’s land area is desert or semi-desert. According to estimates in 2011, only 5.63 percent of Mali’s area can be classified as arable land, and 0.1 percent was planted to permanent crops. Mali was estimated to have 2,358 square kilometers of irrigated land in 2003.  Mali has 100 cubic kilometers of total renewable water resources as off 2011 estimates.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

==Environmental issues==
{{Main|Environmental issues in Mali}}
Mali faces numerous environmental challenges, including desertification, deforestation, soil erosion, drought, and inadequate supplies of potable water. Deforestation is an especially serious and growing problem. According to the Ministry of the
Environment, Mali’s population consumes 6 million tons of wood per year for timber and fuel. To meet this demand, 400,000 hectares of tree cover are lost annually, virtually ensuring destruction of the country’s savanna woodlands.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

Mali is a party to international treaties on [[Biodiversity]], [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Climate Change]], [[Kyoto Protocol|Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol]], [[Desertification]], [[Endangered Species]], [[Hazardous Wastes]], [[Law of the Sea]], [[Ozone Layer Protection]], [[Wetlands]], and [[Whaling]]. It has signed, but not ratified the selected agreements.

==Natural hazards==
Natural hazards in Mali include:
*Desert [[dust storm|sandstorm]]s in the north
* Dust-laden [[harmattan]] wind is common during dry seasons, bringing a dust haze which may ground aircraft and damage computers and sensitive electronics and machines, as well as aggravating respiratory diseases.
* Recurring [[drought]]s
*[[Bushfire]]s in the south
* Occasional [[flood]]s, for example in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)'': "[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900sid/EGUA-753KWT?OpenDocument Mali: Floods DREF Bulletin No. MDRML004]". 13 July 2007. ReliefWeb site retrieved 13 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tropical [[thunderstorm]]s in the south, which may bring wind and [[lightning]] damage as well as flash floods.
* Occasional Niger River flooding
* No harm to wild animals, but for humans in the forests of Mali.

== Extreme points ==

This is a list of the extreme points of [[Mali]], the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

* Northernmost point – the northern section of the border with [[Mauritania]], [[Tombouctou Region]]*
* Easternmost point – the eastern section of the border with [[Niger]]**
* Southernmost point –  Fonto Kourou on the border with [[Cote d'Ivoire]], [[Sikasso Region]]
* Westernmost point -  the [[tripoint]] with [[Senegal]] and [[Mauritania]], [[Kayes Region]]
* *''Note: Mali does not have a northernmost point, the border being formed by a straight east–west line''
* **''Note: Mali does not have an easternmost point, the border being formed by a straight north–south line''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3850">'''Hans Bobek''' (17 May 1903, in [[Klagenfurt]] &amp;ndash; 15 February 1990, in [[Vienna]]) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] [[geographer]]. After his studies in geography at the [[University of Innsbruck]], where [[Johann Sölch]]—a pupil of [[Albrecht Penck]] in Vienna—was his main teacher, he became professor of geography at the [[University of Vienna]] (1951–1971). Bobek is noted for his works on [[cultural geography|cultural]] and [[social geography]], [[urban geography]] as well as on the [[regional geography]] of the [[Near East|Near]] and [[Middle East]], then primarily known as the "[[Orient]]". He was, among others, the author of ''Iran: Probleme eines unterentwickelten Landes alter Kultur''. His theory about rural and urban interactions was called ''Rentenkapitalismus''; another important output was the ''theory of cultural steps'' (''Kulturstufentheorie'').

Bobek was elected a member of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] in 1953&lt;ref&gt;Schuder, W. (ed.) (1987): ''[[Kürschners Deutscher Gelehrten-Kalender]]'', Vol. 15, de Gruyter, Berlin, p. 374. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badw.de/mitglieder/v_mit/v_mit_b/index.html List of deceased members] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, he received an honoraray doctorate from the [[Ruhr University Bochum]].

'''Khwarazm''' {{IPAc-en|k|w|ə|ˈ|r|ɛ|z|ə|m}},&lt;!--Foreign-language names &amp; alt spellings moved to "Names and etymology" below--&gt; or '''Chorasmia''' {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|r|æ|z|m|i|ə}} ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|خوارزم}}}}, ''Xvârazm'') is a large [[oasis]] region on the [[Amu Darya]] [[river delta]] in western [[Central Asia]], bordered on the north by the (former) [[Aral Sea]], on the east by the [[Kyzyl Kum|Kyzylkum desert]], on the south by the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum desert]], and on the west by the [[Ustyurt Plateau]]. It was the center of the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2009|pp=402–405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khwarazmian civilization, and a series of kingdoms such as the [[Persian Empire]], whose capitals were (among others) [[Kath (city)|Kath]], [[Gurganj]] (the modern [[Köneürgenç]]) and – from the [[16th century]] on – [[Khiva]]. Today Khwarazm belongs partly to [[Uzbekistan]], partly to [[Kazakhstan]] and partly to [[Turkmenistan]].

===Etymology===
The Arab geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] in his ''Muʿǧam al-buldan'' wrote that the name was a Persian compound of ''{{transl|fa|khwar}}'' ({{lang|fa|خوار}}), and ''{{transl|fa|razm}}'' ({{lang|fa|رزم}}), referring to the abundance of cooked fish as a main diet of the peoples of this area.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], [[Mu'jam al-buldān]], Vol2, p395&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]], however, believed the Persian name to be made up of ''{{transl|fa|xor}}'' ({{lang|fa|خور}} "the sun") and ''{{transl|fa|zam}}'' ({{lang|fa|زم}} "earth, land"), designating "the land from which the sun rises",&lt;ref&gt;C. E. Bosworth, ''The Encyclopedia of Islam'', Vol IV, 1978. p. 1061&lt;/ref&gt; although a similar etymology is also given for [[Greater Khorasan#Name|Khurasan]]. Another view is that the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] compound stands for "lowland" from ''{{transl|fa|kh(w)ar}}'' "low" and ''{{transl|fa|zam}}'' "land.".&lt;ref name="iranica.com"/&gt;  Khwarazm is indeed the lowest region in [[Central Asia]] (except for the [[Caspian Sea]] to the far west), located on the delta of the [[Amu Darya]] on the southern shores of the [[Aral Sea]]. Various forms of ''{{transl|fa|khwar/khar/khor/hor}}'' are commonly used also in the [[Persian Gulf]] to stand for tidal flats, marshland, or tidal bays (e.g., [[Khor Musa]], [[Khor Abdallah]], [[Hor al-Azim]], [[Hor al-Himar]], etc.)

The name also appears in [[Achaemenid]] inscriptions as ''Huvarazmish'', which is declared to be part of the [[Persian Empire]].

Some of the early scholars believed Khwarazm to be what ancient [[Avesta|Avestic]] texts refer to as {{transl|ae|[[Airyanem Vaejah]]}} (''{{transl|ae|Ariyaneh Waeje}}''; later [[Middle Persian]] ''{{transl|pal|Iran vij}}'').&lt;ref&gt;Bahram Farahvoshi. ''Iranovich'', Tehran University Press. 1991. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; These sources claim that [[Kunya Urgench|Old Urgench]], which was the capital of ancient Khwarazm for many years, was actually Ourva, the eighth land of [[Ahura Mazda]] mentioned in the [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Pahlavi]] text of [[Vendidad]].&lt;ref&gt;Musa Javan. Tarikh-i Ijtima'i Iran-i Bastan (''The social history of ancient Iran''), 1961. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Michael Witzel]], a researcher in early Indo-European history, believes that Airyanem Vaejah was located in what is now [[Afghanistan]], the northern areas of which were a part of ancient Khwarazm and [[Greater Khorasan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/AryanHome.pdf Michael Witzel. "The Home of the Aryans."] (.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, disagree. [[University of Hawaii]] historian [[Elton L. Daniel]] believes Khwarazm to be the "most likely locale" corresponding to the original home of the [[Avesta]]n people, and [[Dehkhoda]] calls Khwarazm "the cradle of the [[Arya]]n tribe" ({{lang|fa|مهد قوم آریا}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[Elton L. Daniel]], ''The History of Iran''. 2001. {{ISBN|0-313-30731-8}}. p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legendary history==
[[Al-Biruni]] (973–1048), a native speaker of [[Chorasmian language|Chorasmian]] (an Iranian language),&lt;ref name="BosworthIranica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
L. Massignon, "Al-Biruni et la valuer internationale de la science arabe" in ''Al-Biruni Commemoration Volume'' (Calcutta, 1951), pp. 217–219. excerpt: In a celebrated preface to the ''Book of Drugs'', [[Biruni]] says: "It is through the Arabic language that the sciences have been transmitted by means of translations from all parts of the world. They have been enhanced by the translation into the Arabic language and have as a result insinuated themselves into men's hearts, and the beauty of this language has commingled with these sciences in our veins and arteries. And if it is true that in all nations one likes to adorn oneself by using the language to which one has remained loyal, having become accustomed to using it with friends and companions according to need, I must judge for myself that in my ''native'' [[Khwarazmian language|Chorasmian]], science has as much as chance of becoming perpetuated as a camel has of facing [[Kaaba]]."
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BosworthEncIslam"/&gt;
says that the land belonging to the mythical king [[Afrasiab]] was first colonised 980 years before [[Alexander the Great]] (thus c. 1292 B.C., well before the [[Seleucid]] era) when the hero of the Iranian epic ''[[Siyavash]]'' came to Khwarazm; his son [[Kay Khusraw]] came to the throne 92 years later, in 1200 B.C. Al-Biruni starts giving names only with the [[Afrighid]] line of Khwarazmshahs, having placed the ascension of Afrighids in 616 of the Seleucid era, i.e. in 305 A.D.

==Early people==
Like [[Soghdiana]], Khwarazm was an expansion of the [[BMAC]] culture during the [[Bronze Age]] which later fused with Indo-Iranians during their migrations around 1000 BC. Early Iron Age states arose from this cultural exchange.  List of successive cultures in Khwarazm region 3000–500 BC:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Khwarezmian language and culture===
{{cleanup|reason=Khwarezmian = Chorasmian|date=July 2012}}
An [[Eastern Iranian languages|East Iranian]] language, known as [[Khwarezmian language]], was spoken in Khwarezm proper (i.e., the lower Amu Darya region) until soon after the Mongol invasion, when it was replaced by Turkic languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v5f5/v5f5a015.html Encyclopedia Iranica, "The Chorasmian Language", D.N.Mackenzie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714064908/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v5f5/v5f5a015.html |date=14 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dalby, ''Dictionary of Languages: The definitive reference to more than 400 languages'', Columbia University Press, 2004, pg 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, D. N. "Khwarazmian Language and Literature," in E. Yarshater ed.

Other than the [[astronomy|astronomical]] terms used by the native [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] Chorasmian speaker [[Al-Biruni]],&lt;ref name="BosworthEncIslam"&gt;Bosworth, C.E. "Ḵh̲ W Ārazm." Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007. Brill Online. Accessed at 10 November 2007 &lt;http://www.brillonline.nl/subscriber/entry?entry=islam_SIM-4205&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; our other sources of Khwarezmian include [[Zamakhshari]]'s [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-[[Persian language|Persian]]–Khwarezmian dictionary and several legal texts that use Khwarezmian terms to explain certain legal concepts.

In the very early part of its history, the inhabitants of the area were from [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', "CENTRAL ASIA: The Islamic period up to the mongols", C. Edmund Bosworth: "In early Islamic times Persians tended to identify all the lands to the northeast of Khorasan and lying beyond the Oxus with the region of Turan, which in the Shahnama of Ferdowsi is regarded as the land allotted to Fereydun's son Tur. The denizens of Turan were held to include the Turks, in the first four centuries of Islam essentially those nomadizing beyond the Jaxartes, and behind them the Chinese (see Kowalski; Minorsky, "Turan"). Turan thus became both an ethnic and a geographical term, but always containing ambiguities and contradictions, arising from the fact that all through Islamic times the lands immediately beyond the Oxus and along its lower reaches were the homes not of Turks but of Iranian peoples, such as the Sogdians and Khwarezmians."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.E. Bosworth, "The Appearance of the Arabs in Central Asia under the Umayyads and the establishment of Islam", in ''History of Civilizations of Central Asia'', Vol. IV: The Age of Achievement: AD 750 to the End of the Fifteenth Century, Part One: The Historical, Social and Economic Setting, edited by M. S. Asimov and C. E. Bosworth. Multiple History Series. Paris: UNESCO Publishing, 1998. excerpt from page 23: "Central Asia in the early seventh century, was ethnically, still largely an Iranian land whose people used various Middle Iranian languages.&lt;/ref&gt; stock and they spoke an Eastern [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] called [[Khwarezmian language|Khwarezmian]]. The famous scientist [[Al-Biruni]], a Khwarezm native, in his ''Athar ul-Baqiyah'',&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|ar|الآثار الباقية عن القرون الخالية}} (p.&amp;nbsp;47)&lt;/ref&gt; specifically verifies the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origins of Khwarezmians when he wrote (in Arabic):

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|ar|أهل خوارزم [...] کانوا غصناً من دوحة الفرس}}&lt;br/&gt;
("The people of the Khwarezm were a branch from [[Persian peoples|Persian]] tree.")&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The area of Khwarezm was under [[Afrighid]] and then [[Samanid]] control until the 10th century before it was conquered by the [[Ghaznavids]].  The Iranian [[Chorasmian language]] and culture felt the pressure of Turkic infiltration from northern Khwarezm southwards, leading to the disappearance of the original Iranian character&lt;ref name="BosworthEncIslam"/&gt; of the province and its complete Turkicisation today, but Khwarezmian speech&lt;ref name="BosworthEncIslam"/&gt; probably lasted in upper Khwarezm, the region round [[Hazarasp]], till the end of the 8th/14th century.&lt;ref name="BosworthEncIslam"/&gt;

The [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Chorasmian language]] survived for several centuries after [[Islam]] until the Turkification of the region, and so must some at least of the culture and lore of ancient Khwarezm, for it is hard to see the commanding figure of [[Al-Biruni]], a repository of so much knowledge, appearing in a cultural vacuum.&lt;ref name="BosworthEncIslam"/&gt;

==Achaemenid, Parthian and Sassanid era==
{{main|Chorasmia (satrapy)}}
[[File:Xerxes I tomb Choresmian soldier circa 470 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Xerxes I]] tomb, Choresmian soldier circa 470 BCE.]]
Sometime before the [[Achaemenid]] king [[Cyrus the Great]]'s death in 530 BC, he had conquered Khwarezm. While he was dying, he appointed his son [[Smerdis of Persia|Smerdis/Bardiya]] as the governor of the region, along with [[Bactriana]], [[Carmania (satrapy)|Carmania]], and the other eastern provinces of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clément Huart|Huart, Clement]]. ''Ancient Persia and Iranian Civilization''. 1972. {{ISBN|0-7100-7242-2}}. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; And the [[Persian people|Persian]] poet [[Ferdowsi]] mentions Persian cities like [[Afrasiab]] and [[Chach (city)|Chach]] in abundance in his epic [[Shahnama]].

When the king of Khwarezm offered friendship to [[Alexander the Great]] in 328 BC, Alexander's Greek and Roman biographers imagined the nomad king of a desert waste, but 20th-century Russian [[archeology|archeologists]] revealed the region as a stable and centralized kingdom, a land of agriculture to the east of the Aral Sea, surrounded by the nomads of [[Central Asia]], protected by its army of mailed horsemen, in the most powerful kingdom northwest of the [[Amu Darya]] (the [[Oxus]] River of antiquity). The king's emissary offered to lead Alexander's armies against his own enemies, west over the Caspian towards the [[Black Sea]] (e.g. [[Caucasian Iberia|Kingdom of Iberia]] and [[Colchis]]). Alexander politely refused.

Although largely independent during the [[Seleucid]], [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Bactrian]] and [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] dynasties, it is known that Khwarezm and neighboring Bactriana were part of the [[Sassanid]] empire during the time of [[Bahram II]]. [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] verifies that Khwarezm was a regional capital of the Sassanid empire. When speaking of the pre-Islamic "''[[khosrau (king)|khosrau]]'' of Khwarezm" ({{lang|fa|خسرو خوارزم}}), the Islamic "[[amir]] of Khwarezm" ({{lang|fa|امیر خوارزم}}), or even the [[Khwarezmid Empire]], sources such as [[Al-Biruni]] and [[Ibn Khordadbeh]] and others clearly refer to Khwarezm as being part of the Iranian (Persian) empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nasser Takmil Homayoun]]. ''Kharazm: What do I know about Iran?''. 2004. {{ISBN|964-379-023-1}}. p.35&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that [[Pahlavi script]] which was used by the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[bureaucracy]] alongside [[Old Persian]], passed into use in Khwarezmia where it served as the first local [[alphabet]] about the [[Anno Domini|AD]] 2nd century, as well as evidence that [[Khwarezmid Empire|Khwarezm-Shahs]] such as [[Ala ad-Din Tekish|ʿAlā al-Dīn Tekish]] (1172–1200) issued all their orders (both administrative and public) in [[Persian language]],&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Simonov&lt;/ref&gt; corroborates Al-Biruni's claims. It was also a vassal kingdom during periods of [[Kushans]], [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalites]] and [[Gokturks]] power before the coming of the Arabs.

==Afrighids==
{{main|Afrighids}}

The Afrighids  ({{lang|fa|آفریغیان-آل آفریغ}}) were a native [[Khwarezmian language|Chorasmian]] (i.g. [[Iranian people|Iranian]]) &lt;ref name="BosworthIranica"&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f7/v1f7a080.html ” ĀL-E AFRĪḠ”  IN Encyclopedia Iranica by C. E. Bosworth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.E.

Asimov and C.E. Bosworth. Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, 1999, 485 pages. (Vol. IV, Pt. I). {{ISBN|81-208-1595-5}}.  Excerpt from page 101: “The ancient Iranian kingdom of Khwarazm had been ruled until 995 by the old established line of Afrighids of Kath, but control subsequently passed to the new line of Khwarazm Shahs, the [[Ma'munids]] of Gurganj”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MuslimDynasties"&gt;Clifford Edmund Bosworth, The New Islamic Dynasties: A Chronological and Genealogical Manual, Columbia University, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  dynasty which ruled over the kingdom of Khwarezm (according to [[Al-Biruni]]) from 305 until 995 A.D. Sometimes it was under [[Sassanid]] control.

In 712 Khwarezm was conquered by the [[Arab]] [[Umayyad]]s. It thus came vaguely under Muslim suzerainty, but it was not until the end of the 8th century or the beginning of the 9th century that an Afrighid Shah was first converted to [[Islam]] appearing with the popular convert’s name of ʿAbdallah (slave of God). In the course of the 10th century, when some geographers such as [[Istakhri]] in his ''Al-Masalik wa-l-mamalik'' mention Khwarezm as part of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiania]], the local family of the [[Ma'munids]] who were based in [[Köneürgenç|Gurganj]], on the left bank of the Amu Darya grew in economic and political importance due to trade caravans. In 995, they violently overthrew the Afrighids of Kath and themselves assumed the traditional title of Khwarazm-Shah. Briefly, the area was under [[Samanid]] suzerainty, before it passed to [[Mahmud of Ghazna]] in 1017. From then on, Turco-Mongolian invasions and long rule by Turco-Mongol dynasties supplanted the [[Iranian people|Iranian]] character of the region&lt;ref name="MuslimDynasties"/&gt; although the title of Khwarezm-Shah was maintained well up to the 13th century.&lt;ref name="MuslimDynasties"/&gt;

==Khwarezmid Empire==
{{main|Khwarezmid Empire}}

[[File:East-Hem 1200ad.jpg|thumb|350px|Political map of Asia, Europe and Africa around 1200 AD showing the Khwarezmid Empire in dark green]]
The [[Khwarezmid Empire]] was founded in the 12th century. It became a vassal of the [[Kara-Khitan Khanate]] after [[Yelü Dashi]] won the [[Battle of Qatwan]] (1141) against a [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] army commanded by [[Sanjar]].&lt;ref&gt;Biran, Michel, The empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian history, (Cambridge University Press, 2005), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Kara-Khitan suzerainty weakened later. The Khwarezmid Empire ruled over all of Persia in the early 13th century under [[Shah]] [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|ʿAlāʾ al-Dīn Muhammad II]] (1200–1220). From 1218 to 1220, [[Genghis Khan]] [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|conquered Central Asia]] including the Kara-Khitan Khanate, thus ending the Khwarezmid Empire. Sultan Muhammad died after retreating from the Mongols near the Caspian Sea, while his son [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu|Jalal ad-Din]], after being defeated by Genghis Khan at the [[Battle of Indus]], sought refuge with the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and was later assassinated after various attempts to defeat the Mongols and the [[Seljuks of Rum|Seljuks]].

==Modern age==

The Khanate on the map surrounds the [[Aral Sea]] (depicted as much smaller than it actually was in those days) and includes much of the today's [[Kazakhstan]]'s and [[Turkmenistan]]'s [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] coast]]
{{main|Khanate of Khiva}}
The region of Khwarezm was split between the [[White Horde]] and [[Jagatai Khanate]], and its rebuilt capital Gurganj (modern [[Kunya Urgench]], "Old Gorganj" as against the modern city of [[Urgench]] some distance away ) again became one of the largest and most important trading centers in Central Asia. In the mid-14th century Khwarezm gained independence from the [[Golden Horde]] under the [[Sufid]] dynasty. However, [[Timur]] regarded Khwarezm as a rival to [[Samarkand]], and over the course of 5 campaigns, he destroyed Urganch completely in 1388. This together with a shift in the course of the Amu-Darya caused the center of Khwarezm to shift to [[Khiva]], which became in the 16th century the capital of the [[Khanate of Khiva]], ruled over by the dynasty of the [[Khanate of Khiva|Arabshahids]].

The rumors of [[gold]] on the banks of the [[Amu Darya]] during the reign of Russia's [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], together with the desire of the [[Russian Empire]] to open a trade route to the Indus (modern day [[Pakistan]]), prompted an armed trade expedition to the region, led by Prince [[Alexander Bekovich-Cherkassky]], which was repelled by Khiva.

It was under Tsars [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] and [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] that serious efforts to annex the region started. One of the main pretexts to Russian military expeditions to Khiva was to free Russian slaves in the khanate and to prevent future slave capture and trade.

Early in [[The Great Game]], Russian interests in the region collided with those of the [[British Empire]] in the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1839.

The Khanate of Khiva was gradually reduced in size from Russian expansion in [[Turkestan]] (including Khwarezm) and, in 1873, a peace treaty was signed that established Khiva as a quasi-independent Russian [[protectorate]].

After the [[Bolshevik]] seizure of power in the [[October Revolution]], a short-lived [[Khorezm SSR|Khorezm People’s Soviet Republic]] (later the Khorezm SSR) was created out of the territory of the old Khanate of Khiva, before in 1924 it was finally incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]], with the former Khanate divided between the new [[Turkmen SSR]], [[Uzbek SSR]] and [[Karakalpak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Karakalpakstan ASSR]] (initially part of [[Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh ASSR]] as Karakalpak Oblast).

The larger historical area of Khwarezm is further divided. Northern Khwarezm became the [[Uzbek SSR]], and in 1925 the western part became the [[Turkmen SSR]]. Also, in 1936 northwestern part became [[Kazakh SSR]]. Following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, these became [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] respectively. Many of the ancient Khwarezmian towns are situated currently in [[Xorazm Province]], [[Uzbekistan]].

Today, the area that was Khwarezm has a mixed population of [[Uzbeks]], [[Karakalpaks]], [[Turkmens]], Tajiks, [[Tatars]], and [[Kazakhs]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==In Persian literature==
[[File:Pir 'Ali al-Jami - A Court Scene with Timur and His Maiden From Khwarezm - Walters W64837A - Full Page.jpg|thumb|[[Emir]] [[Timur]] and his maiden from Khwarezm.]]

Khwarezm and her cities appear in [[Persian literature]] in abundance, in both prose and poetry. [[Dehkhoda]] for example defines the name [[Bukhara]] itself as "full of knowledge", referring to the fact that in antiquity, Bukhara was a scientific and scholarship powerhouse. [[Rumi]] verifies this when he praises the city as such:

Other examples illustrate the eminent status of Khwarezmid and Transoxianian cities in Persian literature in the past 1500 years:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|fa|عالم جانها بر او هست مقرر چنانک}}&lt;br /&gt;
The world of hearts is under his power in the same manner that&lt;br /&gt;
{{lang|fa|دولت خوارزمشاه داد جهان را قرار}}&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Khwarazmshahs]] have brought peace to the world.&lt;br /&gt;
:—[[Khaqani Shirvani]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|fa|یکی پر طمع پیش خوارزمشاه}}&lt;br /&gt;
A greedy one went to Khwarezm-shah&lt;br /&gt;
{{lang|fa|شنیدم که شد بامدادی پگاه}}&lt;br /&gt;
early one morning, so I have heard&lt;br /&gt;
:—[[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], who visited Khwarezm and its capital in 1219, wrote: "I have never seen a city more wealthy and beautiful than [[Konye-Urgench|Gurganj]]". The city, however, was destroyed during several invasions, in particular when the Mongol army broke the dams of the [[Amu Darya]] which flooded the city. He reports that for every Mongol soldier, four inhabitants of Gurganj were killed. [[Najmeddin Kubra]], the great [[Sufi]] master, was among the casualties. The Mongol army that devastated Gurganj was estimated to have been near 80,000 soldiers. The verse below refers to an early previous calamity that fell upon the region:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{lang|fa|آخر ای خاک خراسان داد یزدانت نجات}}&lt;br /&gt;
Oh land of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]! God has saved you,&lt;br /&gt;
{{lang|fa|از بلای غیرت خاک ره گرگانج و کات}}&lt;br /&gt;
from the disaster that befell the land of [[Konye-Urgench|Gurganj]] and [[Kath (city)|Kath]]&lt;br /&gt;
:—Divan of [[Anvari]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, the beauty and fame of [[Bukhara]] and [[Samarqand]] are well known in [[Persian literature]]. The following famous [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] [[ode]] perhaps best provides a notable example of this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{lang|fa|اگر آن ترک شیرازی به دست آرد دل ما را}}&lt;br /&gt;
If that [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]]i Turk can win my heart,&lt;br /&gt;
{{lang|fa|به خال هندویش بخشم سمرقند و بخارا را}}&lt;br /&gt;
I would sell even the jewel cities of [[Samarqand]] and [[Bukhara]] for the Indian mole on her cheek.&lt;br /&gt;
:—[[Hafiz Shirazi|Hafiz]]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Legend has it that [[Tamerlane]] sent for Hafiz regarding this verse and asked angrily: "Are you he who was so bold as to offer my two great cities [[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]] for the mole on thy mistress's cheek?" Hafiz then replied, "Yes, sire, and it is by such acts of generosity that I have brought myself to such a state of destitution that I have now to solicit your bounty." Tamerlane is written to have been so pleased at his ready wit that he dismissed the poet with a handsome present.

'''''Landscape with Two Nymphs''''' is a c.1659 painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]]. A late work, it seems to have been painted for [[Charles Le Brun]], another painter. It was sold from the Radziwiłł collection in 1866 to [[Frédéric Reiset]], a curator at the Louvre. Reiset sold it with the rest of his collection to [[Henri d'Orleans, Duke of Aumale]] in 1879 and so the work is now in the [[Musée Condé]] in Chantilly

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6290">[[Bangladeshi cuisine]] refers to the food and culinary traditions prevalent in [[Bangladesh]]. Dating far in the past, the cuisine emphasizes fish, vegetables and lentils served with rice. Because of differences in history and Bangladeshi geography, the cuisine is rich in regional variations. While having unique traits, Bangladeshi cuisine is closely related to that of surrounding Bengali and North-East Indian, with rice and fish traditional favorites. Bangladesh also developed the only multi-course tradition from the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is known as ''Bengali Kita'' styled cuisine. The Bangladeshi food is served by course rather than all at one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/jng_chef/eating_n_serving.htm Bengal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

This episode is alternatively titled "Rooksby", after the character in the stage play ''The Banana Box'', from which ''Rising Damp'' was adapted. The character was renamed to Rigsby because a real-life landlord named Rooksby complained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/rising-damp/season-4/details |title=''Rising Damp'': Season 1 |author=&lt;!-- Staff writer --&gt; |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rigsby asks Miss Jones to a [[wrestling]] match, which she declines. Alan gives him some tablets and a [[Matt Monro]] LP, suggesting that he one of the tablets and play the record whilst talking to her. Philip gives Rigsby a [[medallion]] to wear. After Rigsby leaves the room, Alan informs Philip that the tablets are [[tranquilliser]]s which were withdrawn from the markets because they turn the patients' urine green. Rigsby plays the record at the wrong speed, and she rejects his attempt to seduce her. He collapses and falls asleep for 24 hours. He sees a doctor, who tells him that the tablets are for pregnant women. Philip advises Rigsby to burn the wood of the love tree outside Miss Jones' room as an [[aphrodisiac]]. She finds the smell unpleasant, so she sprays Rigsby and the wood with water. Philip tells him that the piece of wood came off the wardrobe.

===DRC===

'''Mesh Bukavu''': A project of News for Peace, which among other things runs Radio Maendeleo, a community radio station. It is the result of a collaboration of Free Press, a Dutch organization, and was bootstrapped with funding and training from the Open Technology Institute (OTI). The training took place in November 2014 and the network was deployed in January 2015. It has a strong emphasis on local hosting of content (Wikipedia, blogs, audio lessons, e-books), and also other local services like a local chat. It is valued also as a standby when official net shutdowns occur, e.g. at election times.

The network, which is still operational, consists of 10-15 nodes, (Ubiquiti NanoStation and Rockets) running Commotion firmware. Equipment is mounted on rooftops of participant organisations especially if they have backup electricity (solar is being phased in).[https://www.freepressunlimited.org/en/news/people-of-dr-congo-will-communicate- using-their-own-mesh-network] [https://www.facebook.com/people/Mesh-Bukavu/100010181648152] [https://webwewant.org/news/fastafrica-mesh-bukavu-workshop-democratic-republic-congo/] [https://communitytechnology.github.io/docs/blog/mesh-bukavu-designing-a-network-from- scratch/] [https://communitytechnology.github.io/files/downloads/SEED_Report_Final.pdf] [https://www.newamerica.org/documents/1371/rebuilding-technology.pdf]

'''Mesh Goma''':  An experiment of a local organization, the Collective of Community Radio and TV in North Kivu (CORACON), in partnership with Free Press Unlimited and inspired by Mesh Bukavu. It also received Seed funding from the OTI.

The network was initially deployed in January 2015 with the idea of providing access to information to the areas in the city of Goma which lacked this access. It consisted of 15 nodes (14 Ubiquiti and 1 Tp-Link). It is no longer operational due to the problems with access and costs of reliable electricity in Goma, and the lack of digital stewards keen to work voluntarily in maintaining the network. Additionally, the network was only providing intranet services, which did not make it attractive to the majority of the population in Goma.[https://communitytechnology.github.io/docs/seed-grants/] [https://communitytechnology.github.io/files/downloads/SEED_Report_Final.pdf]

'''Pamoja Net''' (pamoja means 'together' in Swahili) is a local mesh on the island of Idjwi in Lake Kivu, between the DRC and Rwanda.  It reports 200 regular WiFi users, as well as institutions such as a radio station, the police, and the electoral commission. It also has a public display screen and tablets for casual users in a kiosk. Its backhaul is via line-of-sight links to Bukavu, where another community network is located (although Pamoja's gateway is via an internet cafe there).

The network was created in 2015 by Project First Light, a partnership of NGOs and businesses. The partnership still oversees operations, although it has trained local "guardians" to conduct day-to-day running. In terms of governance, the local traditional leader (who originally requested internet connectivity) is committed to operating Pamoja as a commons.[https://www.fjordnet.com/workdetail/bringing-the-internet-to-africas-forgotten-island/]

===Ghana===

'''Akwapim Community Wireless Network:'''  installed and maintained by a small group of volunteers associated with the Apirede Community Resource center. Both the resource centre and the community network are projects of the Community-Based Libraries and Information Technology (CBLit), a non-government organization based in both Ghana and the United States. It started in 2005 in response to the local community’s requests for connectivity to help them break their isolation, as an extension of a public library initiative, with the support of the US Peace Corps. Its first phase had 10 nodes, and the second was to have another 10. The second phase was also to use a V-Sat link. Most nodes use old PCs as routers, with new WiFi cards (Dell OptiPlex units and D-Link DWLG520 cards). Its website is down and no information after 2009 can be found online,.[http://www.muniwireless.com/2006/11/05/voip-on-cuwin-network-in-rural-ghana/][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPD4Ep_J81k][http://www.schmoller.net/documents/Wireless_Ghana_A_Case_Study.pdf]

===Kenya===

'''Tunapandanet''': This was started and funded in the last 5 years by an educational-development NGO (Tunapanda Institute, which got early funding via Indiegogo, and had high input from American “backpacker” volunteers). The network serves to further its outreach (educational activities center on Edubuntu thin client system) into large, high-density slum. Of particular interest is the organization’s emphasis on cached/recorded content to avoid external data costs. Base station and 3 nodes: Ubiquity PicoStation (short range, omnidirectional), Ubiquiti NanoStation (medium range, directional), Ubiquiti Rocket. Network likely expanding as the organisation is active.[http://www.tunapanda.org/]

===Namibia===

'''Connecting Eenhana''': This was created in 2015 by a partnership between the University of Namibia and the Glowdom Educational Foundation with a grant from the OTI to support learning amongst community members of the small town of Eenhana and surrounding villages. In particular, it aimed at supporting the generation and sharing local content and to increase access of schools to educational content, including for learners and students at a Special school for Deaf learners. Additionally, the local content creation was extended to provide local government information, as well as transparency and accountability of local government It connects 7 sites using Ubiquiti routers, indoor coverage is provided using Mesh Potatoes to provide VoIP services too. All the network runs SECN firmware. It is only partly functional at the moment, due to equipment failure due to overheating and difficult terrain (very flat and with tall trees, which prevent Line of Sight between the nodes).[https://shingapi.blogspot.com/2015/07/community-mesh-network-in-northern.html][https://communitytechnology.github.io/files/downloads/SEED_Report_Final.pdf][https://www.newamerica.org/documents/1371/rebuilding-technology.pdf]

===Nigeria===

'''Fantsuam Foundation''': Started in 2009 with SEED funding and having only 2 nodes, ZittNet is a department of Fantsuam Foundation (an NGO in Kaduna), and focuses mainly on ICT training; nonetheless it was honored as Nigeria’s first rural ISP. It was also intended to provide rural students with access to (downloaded) offline study materials. It started off having a VSat connection but due to cost is trying to replace this with a fiber connection. It notably uses solar backup to maintain service in the absence of reliable grid power.[http://fantsuam.net/project/zittnet-nigeria%E2%80%99s-first-rural-community-wireless-network-and-training-centre][https://www.newamerica.org/documents/1371/rebuilding-technology.pdf][https://communitytechnology.github.io/files/downloads/SEED_Report_Final.pdf][http://www.dadamac.org/blog/2015-10/fantsuam-wireless-network-mesh]

'''Ibadan WUG''': Started by one of the Mesh Potato project’s earlier contributors in a residential precinct in Ibadan. It is still actively providing connectivity largely to students. It consists of 22 Mesh Potatoes.[https://villagetelco.org/2013/02/ibadan-wireless-user-group/]

===Somalia===

'''Abaarso''': Initiated by an American working as ICT instructor in Somalia to serve the Abaarso School of Science and Technology due to poor and at times nonexistent internet. Also involved some local cloud hosting. Used Ubiquity &amp; Commotion. Current status unknown.[https://commotionwireless.net/blog/2013/12/12/building-mesh-network-rural-somaliland/]

===South Africa===

'''Siyakhula Living Labs''': It started in 2005 involving the Telkom Centre of Excellence at two universities, Rhodes and Fort Hare. The first network was intended to provide exposure to international markets to the local arts and craft entrepreneurs within the Dwesa community; and started off with 3 nodes at schools, consisting of WiMAX backbone with WIFI hotspots around each node, and a VSAT backhaul and later growing to at least 14 nodes. From the initial offering of e-commerce services this grew to providing information and communication services (including telephony services, emailing, school administration, etc.) both for the schools and the surrounding communities. The network grew from the three nodes to about 14+ (might have actually been 17 schools at the end) and offering a whole plethora of services to the schools and the communities. The network is still operational but barely, largely due to funding challenge. The second network was started by a researcher from the University of Fort Hare (UFH) who deployed a community wireless mesh network consisting of seven nodes using nanostations m2 (3) and picostations m2-hp (4) connected through a VSAT sponsored by Sifunda Kunye Educational Foundation in a location called Ntselamanzi, Its operation is linked to a research project by a student at UFH, which meant that its active management and administration has slowed down since the student completed his work. Still, it has plans to be extended to neighbouring communities.[http://www.siyakhulall.org/]

'''Rural Telehealth''': The University of Western Cape led a series of rural wireless projects, lasting several years each, between 2003-2012, connecting remote hospitals and clinics in the Eastern Cape province. There was also an initial try at rural community networks, even mesh. These involved long range (up to 15&amp;nbsp;km) line-of-sight WiFi links, in both 2.4 and 5&amp;nbsp;GHz. At times, they were connected to one or two expensive VSAT links. All were powered by deep cycle 12v batteries, charged either by solar panels or trickle charged from unreliable mains. Despite robust technical performance, the networks and apps created for them were not fully utilised mainly due to social reasons, e.g. power relations, suspicion of motives and the single champion problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tucker et al|first=William|year=2007|title=Reflection on three years of rural wireless Internet Protocol communication|url=|journal=Southern African Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (SATNAC)|volume=|pages=452–457|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peebles Valley Mesh Network''': Centred on a clinic dealing with AIDS patients, where a VSat connection provided a gateway for a mesh of 6 nodes serving the surrounding area including a school. Supported by First Mile First Inch, a collaboration including Meraka and various academic and development agencies, mainly funded by IDRC. Lapsed due to high cost of VSat and lack of continued support.[http://www.fmfi.org.za/wiki/index.php/Mpumalanga_Mesh:Project_Overview]

'''Bo-Kaap''': A now-defunct “testbed” experiment in a historic inner-city precinct involving 75 of the early Mesh Potatoes and an internet gateway, funded by the Shuttleworth Foundation. Unfortunately technology was prioritised over human capacity-building; problems with the equipment combined with lack of community buy-in led to the project lapsing.[https://villagetelco.org/deployments/bokaap/]

'''Orange Farm''': Another pilot project in the development of the Village Telco technology/business model, in a township near Johannesburg. Social enterprise Dabba installed Mesh Potatoes and cheap VoIP handsets. However the network seems to have lapsed after the rapid proliferation of cellular telephony created a more powerful “network effect” so the micro-entrepreneurs Dabba anticipated were not forthcoming.[http://www.balancingact-africa.com/news/en/issue-no-412/top-story/dabba-looks-set-to-m/en][[Dabba (company)|Dabba]]

'''Kranshoek Mesh''': A truly community-driven network in a historic coastal village occupied by an ethnic minority. Using Mesh Potatoes, it promised to bring relief from high communications cost in a context of high unemployment, but current status is unknown.[https://villagetelco.org/deployments/wayne-abroue-south-africa/]

'''Zenzeleni Networks''': Formed with technical assistance from the University of the Western Cape, it is registered as a co-operative enterprise and a telecoms provider, operated and managed by members of Mankosi, a rural community in one of the most disadvantaged areas of South Africa. It has 12 nodes linked via a long distance WiFi backbone to a fibre gateway. Each node consists of a Mesh Potato connected to a solar power supply. It provides access to voices services at a fraction of the cost offered by incumbent operators. Currently under way are the provision of WiFi hotspots and connection of local schools’ computer labs, as well as backhaul improvement.[http://zenzeleni.net/][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxTPSWMX26M]

'''Scarborough Wireless User Group''': A middle-class peri-urban DIY community was sharing internet access by mesh with each other and some poorer neighbours near Cape Town. At its peak it had about 200 nodes. Used Linksys WRT54GL routers. Defunct due to arrival of cheaper, faster ADSL &amp; fibre.[http://www.prospect.ac.za/wifi/faq.html]

'''Cape Town WUG''': Although using the term “mesh” this large urban network (registered as a nonprofit organisation) is more correctly described as decentralised. With some hundreds of members, its only official connection to the internet is for POP email; otherwise, the main functions are offline file-sharing and gaming. It has a progressive constitution regarding sharing of skills and resources and some cross-subsidisation is evident between richer and poorer areas.[http://www.ctwug.za.net/]

'''Johannesburg Area WUG''': Similar to above; is a member not only of Wireless Application Providers Association, but Internet Service Providers Association.[http://www.jawug.org.za/]

'''SoWUG:''' Hybrid CN/ISP in Soweto, South Africa. Started in 2010 with corporate sponsorship and technical support from the Johannesburg Area WUG. It provides WiFi hotspots in public spaces in Soweto and nearby peri-urban areas. The organisation’s website maps out several operations it intends to expand into such as educational support.[http://www.sowug.org.za/home/]

'''Durban Wireless Community''': Smaller (approx 50 nodes) and more sporadically active; founded 2004 and recently revived; a non-profit promoting wireless technology and computer networks.[https://web.archive.org/web/20081223092144/http://www.dwc.za.net/]

'''Other WUG'''s: Another five nuclei of smaller, sporadic groups are [http://www.wug.za.net/ listed].

'''Pretoria Mesh''': This is an experimental project started in 2006 in the residential village of the CSIR, to test hardware and software deployed in other projects throughout the country. It has about 20 nodes and is still active.[http://wirelessafrica.meraka.org.za/wiki/index.php/Pretoria_Mesh]

'''B4All:''' This is an abbreviation of Broadband Community Wireless Mesh Network which was a government program targeting the digital divide in rural areas, but which eventually merged with a commercial organisation providing school connectivity and public hotspots. It launched in 2009 in Limpopo province and public-sector involvement ended in 2014.[http://embizounify.com/?v=68caa8201064]

'''ICT4RED:''' The ICT for Rural Education (ICT4RED) project (2012-2016), undertaken by CSIR Meraka, was the largest research, development, innovation and implementation project of its kind in South Africa. It formed the ICT aspect of the larger Cofimvaba Technology for Rural Education Development (TECH4RED) project, a joint initiative between the Department of Science and Technology, the Department of Basic Education and the Eastern Cape Department of Education. TECH4RED is aimed at contributing to the improvement of rural education through technology-led innovation. ICT4RED was particularly successful in implementing technology in schools and in empowering rural teachers to comfortably use tablets in their day-to-day teaching activities, by using gamification principles and an "earn-as-you-learn" approach. ICT4RED employed a mesh network connecting 26 schools, with internet connectivity provided via shared satellite infrastructure. In 2016 the project has been handed over to the district and the province authorities to institutionalize the initiative.[http://www.ict4red.co.za/]

'''Home of Compassion''': This N.P.O. based in Delft (Cape Town), has piloted a community network since 2015. It started with funding from the Western Cape Government and the support of an external ISP to roll out the network but once they built enough technical capacity, they decided to become an ISP themselves. By November 2015, it had 20 active access points and 17,150 active devices. They offer 50MB allowance a day per device and once users reach their cap, they sell prepaid top-up vouchers though a network of local resellers. In addition to the provision of Wi-Fi connectivity, Home of Compassion provides IT training and through its network it is able to set up “call centres on-demand”. Finally, Home of Compassion has developed an app, which is zero-rated across its network, to purchase goods and services within the community.&lt;ref&gt;Geerdts, C., Gillwald, A., Calandro, E., Rademan, B., and Chair, C. (2016). Developing Smart Public Wi-Fi in South Africa. (Under publication.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanzania===

'''ICT for Rural Development''' (ICT4RD): This nationwide initiative had 2 pilot networks set up in Bunda and Serengeti in 2006. Assistance came from Swedish researchers and the agency SIDA. Both pilots were motivated by existence of fibre optic cables owned by other entities, however use was also made of a VSat connection at Bunda. Local governments were involved to create ownership and sustainability but contributed to the demise of the first. The remaining one connects schools and hospitals.[http://ict4rd.ne.tz/]

'''Sengerema Wireless Community Network''': A project of the Sengerema multi-purpose Telecenter which provides computer services, printing, office, internet, education, FM Radio Station (reaching 400 000 people) with support from Dutch NGO, IICD. In 2012 it had an internet connection - VSAT 128/64 kbit/s through COSTECH (Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology). The network served a large number of civil society and official organisations including schools. It featured wireless routers: Linksys WRT54GL; firmware OpenWRT/Freifunk; self-built antennas (with some exceptions) and locally built masts. Current status unknown, believed to be lapsed.[http://www.ruralict.com/2008/11/sengerema-wireless-community-network-up.html][http://www.share4dev.info/telecentreskb/documents/4545.pdf]

===Tunisia===

'''Mesh SAYADA''': A project of Clibre (a local open-web advocacy group) that started in 2012. The networking equipment (12 nodes) was donated by the Open Technology Institute, and the time was volunteer. The network is not really operating currently, largely due to the unstable sociopolitical situation.[https://nawaat.org/portail/2014/05/31/mesh-sayada-entre-fantasme-et-realite/][https://commotionwireless.net/files/posts/041814-Case-Study-Sayada.pdf][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4TCPoXlBSI]

===Uganda===

'''Bosco Network''': Battery Operated System for Community Outreach (BOSCO)-Uganda is a Non-Profit Organization (NGO) under the trusteeship of the Archdiocese of Gulu. Funded and operational since the year 2007 the organization started in installing wireless Internet and VoIP telephony in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps with reliable eco-friendly energy. 9 years later BOSCO-Uganda is managing 32 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Centers situated in rural communities and former internally displaced persons camps, consist of low-power, solar powered PCs connected to a high-speed, long-range WiFi Internet connection. Each communication station is linked to other BOSCO sites via a free VoIP telephony network and through a high-speed internal network (INTRANET) content management page that are all powered by solar energy and enabling thousands of Ugandans in acquiring ICT and entrepreneurship knowledge, connecting them with other communities (e.g. market platform) and the outside world.[http://boscouganda.com/our-approach/bosco-network/]

===Zambia===

'''Macha Works''': Macha Works' LinkNet internet provisioning in the rural community of Macha, in Choma District, Southern Zambia, is a renowned example of a community networking in Southern Africa. The first internet connection became available for the community, early 2004, by means of a shared satellite internet connection with a medical research center in the community. From its start, so-called ‘local talent’ gained experience in collaboration with international partners but always approached realities from the local perspective first. The networking morphs continuously, utilising a variety of available technologies. These (did) include mesh network technologies and direct WiFi links, the use of second-hand computers, and the deployment of locally refurbished sea containers for the sensitising for the internet in other rural communities in Zambia and Zimbabwe. With the implementation of a WiMax network by a commercial operator and with debilitating donor-led intrusions of the LinkNet developed 'market' in its community, Macha Works focuses more on user training, technical training, and the maintenance of ICT equipment. The Macha network inspired and trained local leadership in both the technical and communal aspects of the provisioning of internet access in rural area. At least 7 other communities in Zambia emulate Macha's example and run a plethora of community networks and ICT services..[http://www.machaworks.org/]

===Zimbabwe===

'''Murambinda Works''': Established in the early 2000s, Murambinda Works at Buhera in Zimbabwe is focused on bridging the digital divide between rural and urban settings. In this sense, Murambinda works provides ICT training in rural communities where most schools lack relevant computer facilities. It is affiliated with Macha Works in Zambia and has various operations, including internet service provision and an internet cafe.

After using dial-up internet until 2015, it now has a fibre link to the national backbone. Training is provided for public officials including teachers, and any surplus revenue is channeled to a local foster home. Plans are afoot to extend to remote access points, perhaps even by satellite although for now costs are prohibitive..[http://www.machaworks.org/murumbinda.html]

'''Local coordinates''' are measurement indices into a ''local [[coordinate system]]'' or a ''local [[coordinate space]]''. A simple example is using house numbers to locate a [[house]] on a [[street]]; the street is a local coordinate system within a larger system composed of city townships, states, countries, etc.

Local systems exist for convenience. Continuing the geographic example, one could use [[latitude and longitude]] for all terrestrial locations, but unless one has a highly precise [[GPS]] device, this is impractical.

In [[computer graphics]] and [[computer animation]], local coordinate spaces are also useful for their ability to model independently transformable aspects of geometrical [[scene graph]]s. When modeling a car, for example, it is desirable to describe the center of each wheel with respect to the car's coordinate system, but then specify the shape of each wheel in separate local spaces centered about these points. This way, the information describing each wheel can be simply duplicated four times, and independent transformations (e.g., steering rotation) can be similarly effected. Bounding volumes of objects may be described more accurately using extents in the local coordinates, (i.e. an [[object oriented bounding box]], contrasted with the simpler [[axis aligned bounding box]]).

The tradeoff for this flexibility is additional computational cost: the rendering system must access the higher-level coordinate system of the car and combine it with the space of each wheel in order to draw everything in its proper place.

Local coordinates also afford digital designers a means around the finite limits of numerical representation. The [[tread marks]] on a tire, for example, can be described using millimetres by allowing the whole tire to occupy the entire range of numeric precision available. The larger aspects of the car, such as its frame, might be described in centimetres, and the terrain that the car travels on could be specified in meters.

In [[differential topology]], local coordinates on a [[manifold]] are defined by means of an [[atlas (topology)|atlas of charts]]. The basic idea behind coordinate charts is that each small patch of a manifold can be endowed with a set of local coordinates. These are collected together into an atlas, and stitched together in such a way that they are self-consistent on the manifold.

A '''local positioning system''' ('''LPS''') is a navigation system that provides location information in all weather, anywhere within the coverage of the network, where there is an unobstructed [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] to three or more signaling [[Electric beacon|beacon]]s of which the exact position on earth is known. A special type of LPS is the [[real-time locating system]]; which also allows real-time tracking of an object or person in a confined area such as a building.

==Use==
Unlike [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] or other [[global navigation satellite system]]s, ''local positioning systems'' don't provide global coverage. Instead, they use (a set of) beacons which have a limited range, hence requiring the user to be near these. Beacons include [[cellphone|cellular]] [[base station]]s, [[Wi-Fi positioning system|Wi-Fi]] and [[LiFi]] access points, and radio [[broadcast tower]]s.

In the past, long-range LPS's have been used for navigation of ships and aircraft. Examples are the [[Decca Navigator System]] and [[LORAN]].

Nowadays, local positioning systems are often used as complementary (and in some cases alternative) positioning technology to GPS, especially in areas where GPS does not reach or is weak, for example, [[Indoor positioning system|inside buildings]], or [[urban canyon]]s.  Local positioning using cellular and broadcast towers can be used on cell phones that do not have a GPS receiver. Even if the phone has a GPS receiver, battery life will be extended if cell tower location accuracy is sufficient.

==Techniques==
An LPS can use any of the following to calculate the position of an object:
* [[triangulation]]
* [[trilateration]]
* [[multilateration]]

* [[Hybrid positioning system]]
* [[Indoor positioning system]]

The '''Mason–Dixon line''', also called the '''Mason and Dixon line''' or '''Mason's and Dixon's line''', was [[Surveying|surveyed]] between 1763 and 1767 by [[Charles Mason]] and [[Jeremiah Dixon]] in the resolution of a border dispute involving [[Maryland]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Delaware]] in [[Colonial America]]. It is still a [[demarcation line]] among four U.S. states, forming part of the borders of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and [[West Virginia]] (originally part of [[Virginia]] before 1863). Later it became known as the border between the [[Northern United States]] and the [[Southern United States]]. Before the [[Missouri Compromise]], the line (west of Delaware) marked the northern limit of slavery in the United States.

==Background==
{{main article|Penn–Calvert boundary dispute}}

[[History of Maryland#Colonial Maryland|Maryland's charter]] of 1632 granted the Calverts land north of the entire length of the [[Potomac River]] up to the [[40th parallel north|40th parallel]]. A problem arose when [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] granted a [[History of Pennsylvania#British colonial period|charter for Pennsylvania]] in 1681. The grant defined Pennsylvania's southern border as identical to Maryland's northern border, but described it differently, as Charles relied on an inaccurate map. The terms of the grant clearly indicate that Charles II and [[William Penn]] believed the 40th parallel would intersect the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]] around [[New Castle, Delaware]], when in fact it falls north of the original boundaries of the City of [[Philadelphia]], the site of which [[William Penn|Penn]] had already selected for his colony's capital city. Negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681. A compromise proposed by Charles II in 1682, which might have resolved the issue, was undermined by Penn receiving the additional grant of the "Three Lower Counties" along [[Delaware Bay]], which later became the [[Delaware Colony]], a satellite of Pennsylvania. Maryland considered these lands part of its original grant.&lt;ref name=hubbard&gt;{{cite book |last= Hubbard |first= Bill, Jr. |title= American Boundaries: the Nation, the States, the Rectangular Survey |year= 2009 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-226-35591-7 |pages= 20–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflict became more of an issue when settlement extended into the interior of the colonies. In 1732 the [[Proprietary Governor|proprietary governor]] of Maryland, [[Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore]], signed a provisional agreement with [[William Penn]]'s sons, which drew a line somewhere in between and renounced the Calvert claim to Delaware. But later, Lord Baltimore claimed that the document he had signed did not contain the terms he had agreed to, and refused to put the agreement into effect. Beginning in the mid-1730s, violence erupted between settlers claiming various loyalties to Maryland and Pennsylvania. The border conflict would be known as [[Cresap's War]].

Progress was made after a [[Court of Chancery]] ruling affirming the 1732 agreement, but the issue remained unresolved until [[Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore]] ceased contesting the claims on the Maryland side and accepted the earlier agreements. Maryland's border with Delaware was to be based on the  [[Transpeninsular Line]] and the Twelve-Mile Circle around New Castle. The Pennsylvania–Maryland border was defined as the line of latitude {{convert|15 |miles}} south of the southernmost house in Philadelphia (on what is today [[South Street (Philadelphia)|South Street]]). As part of the settlement, the Penns and Calverts commissioned the English team of [[Charles Mason]] and [[Jeremiah Dixon]] to [[surveying|survey]] the newly established boundaries between the [[Province of Pennsylvania]], the [[Province of Maryland]], and [[Delaware Colony]].&lt;ref name=hubbard/&gt;

In 1779, Pennsylvania and Virginia agreed "To extend Mason's and Dixon's line, due west, five degrees of longitude, to be computed from the river Delaware, for the southern boundary of Pennsylvania, and that a meridian, drawn from the western extremity thereof to the northern limit of the said state, be the western boundary of Pennsylvania for ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barton |first=William |title= Memoirs of the life of David Rittenhouse, LLD. F.R.S. |year=1818 |publisher=E. Parker |pages=282–283 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_J8RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA283#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Pennsylvania abolished [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] in 1781, the western part of this line and the [[Ohio River]] became a border between [[slave and free states]], with Delaware&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Slavery in Delaware |url= http://slavenorth.com/delaware.htm |website= Slavery in the North |accessdate=6 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; retaining slavery until the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] was ratified in 1865.

==Geography of the line==
[[File:Delaware-wedge.svg|thumb|250px|Diagram of the survey lines creating the Mason–Dixon line and "[[Wedge (border)|The Wedge]]"]]
[[File:Marycolony.png|thumb|250px|Province of Maryland, 1632–1776]]

Mason's and Dixon's actual survey line began to the south of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and extended from a [[Benchmark (surveying)|benchmark]] east to the [[Delaware River]] and west to what was then the boundary with western Virginia.

The surveyors also fixed the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania and the approximately north-south portion of the boundary between Delaware and Maryland. Most of the Delaware–Pennsylvania boundary is an [[Twelve-Mile Circle|arc]], and the Delaware–Maryland boundary does not run truly north-south because it was intended to bisect the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] rather than follow a meridian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Drawing the Line How Mason and Dixon Surveyed the Most Famous Border in America | publisher=John Wiley | author=Danson, Edwin | year=2001 | pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maryland–Pennsylvania boundary is an east–west line with an approximate mean [[latitude]] of 39°43′20″&amp;nbsp;N ([[datum (geodesy)|Datum]] [[WGS&amp;nbsp;84]]). In reality, the east–west Mason–Dixon line is not a true line in the geometric sense, but is instead a series of many adjoining line segments, following a path between latitude 39°43′15″&amp;nbsp;N and 39°43′23″&amp;nbsp;N.

The surveyors also extended the boundary line {{convert|40 |miles}} west of Maryland's western boundary, into territory that was still in dispute between Pennsylvania and Virginia, though this was contrary to their original charter.&lt;ref name=hubbard/&gt; Mason and Dixon's survey was finished on October&amp;nbsp;9, 1767, about {{convert|31 |miles}} east of what is now Pennsylvania's southwest corner.&lt;ref name="Wilford2001"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wilford |first= John Noble |title=The Mapmakers: Revised Edition |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vHy44e1nRXcC&amp;pg=PA215 |accessdate= 2012-11-01|year=2001 |publisher= Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-375-70850-3|pages=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1774, commissioners from Pennsylvania and Virginia met to negotiate their boundary, which at the time involved Pennsylvania's southern border west of Maryland and its entire western border. Both sides agreed that Pennsylvania's grant made its western border a tracing of the course of the Delaware River, displaced five degrees to the west. And both sides thought this would place [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] in Virginia territory (in fact it would not have). With that in mind, the governor of Pennsylvania argued that, despite the agreement reached with Maryland, Pennsylvania's southern border west of Maryland was still the [[39th parallel north|39th parallel]], about {{convert|50 |miles}} south of the Mason–Dixon line. Negotiations continued for five years, with a series of proposed lines. In the end, a compromise was reached: the Mason–Dixon line would be extended west to a point five degrees west of the Delaware River. To compensate Pennsylvania for the claimed territory lost, its western boundary would be run due north rather than copying the course of the Delaware River.&lt;ref name=hubbard/&gt;

The Mason–Dixon line was [[Milestone|marked by stones every mile]] and "crownstones" every {{convert|5|miles}}, using stone shipped from England. The Maryland side says "(M)" and the Delaware and Pennsylvania sides say "(P)". Crownstones include the two coats of arms. Today, while a number of the original stones are missing or buried, many are still visible, resting on public land and protected by iron cages.&lt;ref name = "WaPo"&gt;William Ecenbarger, "Neglecting the Mason–Dixon boundary stones", ''The Washington Post'', January 1, 2017, p. C4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mason and Dixon confirmed earlier survey work, which delineated Delaware's southern boundary from the Atlantic Ocean to the "Middle Point" stone (along what is today known as the Transpeninsular Line). They proceeded nearly due north from this, to the Pennsylvania border.

Later, the line was marked in places by additional benchmarks and survey markers. The lines have been resurveyed several times over the centuries without substantive changes to Mason's and Dixon's work. The stones may be a few, to a few hundred, feet east or west of the point Mason and Dixon thought they were: in any event, the line drawn from stone to stone forms the legal boundary.

According to Dave Doyle at the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|National Geodetic Survey]], part of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], the common corner of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware, at [[Wedge (border)|The Wedge]] is marked by Boundary Monument&amp;nbsp;#87. The marker "MDP Corner" dates from 1935 and is offset on purpose.

Doyle said the Maryland–Pennsylvania Mason–Dixon line is exactly:

:          39°43′19.92216″&amp;nbsp;N

and Boundary Monument #87 is on that parallel, at:

:         075°47′18.93851″&amp;nbsp;W.

Visitors to the tripoint are strongly encouraged to first obtain permission from the nearest landowner, or use the path from the arc corner monument, which is bordered by Delaware parkland most of the way, and Pennsylvania parkland the entire way.

==History==
[[File:Masondixonmarker.jpg|thumb|A "crownstone" boundary monument on the Mason–Dixon line. These markers were originally placed at every 5th mile ({{cvt|5|mi |disp=out}}) along the line, ornamented with family coats of arms facing the state that they represented. The coat of arms of Maryland's founding [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Calvert]] family is shown. On the other side are the arms of [[William Penn]].]]

The line was established to end a boundary dispute between the British colonies of Maryland and Pennsylvania/Delaware. Maryland had been granted the territory north of the Potomac River up to the fortieth parallel. Pennsylvania's grant defined the colony's southern boundary as following a [[Twelve-Mile Circle|12-mile (radius) circle]]  ({{cvt|12|mi |disp=out}}) counter-clockwise from the Delaware River until it hit "the beginning of the fortieth degree of Northern latitude." From there the boundary was to follow the fortieth parallel due west for five degrees of longitude. But the fortieth parallel does not in fact intersect the 12-mile circle, instead lying significantly farther north. Thus Pennsylvania's southern boundary as defined in its charter was contradictory and unclear. The most serious problem was that the Maryland claim would put [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], the major city in Pennsylvania, within Maryland.&lt;ref name=hubbard/&gt;

The dispute was peacefully resolved in 1767&lt;ref&gt;Konkle, Burton Alva. (1932). ''Benjamin Chew 1722–1810: Head of the Pennsylvania judiciary system under colony and commonwealth''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. p. 63-4.&lt;/ref&gt; when the boundary was fixed as follows:

* Between Pennsylvania and Maryland:
** The parallel (latitude line) {{convert|15|mi|km|0}} south of the then southernmost point in Philadelphia, measured to be at about 39°43′ N and agreed upon as the Maryland–Pennsylvania line.
* Between Delaware and Maryland:
** The existing east–west transpeninsular line from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Chesapeake Bay]], as far as its midpoint from the Atlantic.
** A [[Twelve-Mile Circle|12-mile (radius) circle]] ({{convert|12|mi|km|0|abbr=on}}) around the city of New Castle, Delaware.
** A "tangent line" connecting the midpoint of the transpeninsular line to the western side of the 12-mile circle.
** A "north line" along the meridian (line of longitude) from the tangent point to the Maryland Pennsylvania border.
** Should any land within the 12-mile circle fall west of the north line, it would remain part of Delaware. (This was indeed the case, and this border is the "arc line".)
[[File:A Plan of the West Line or Parallel of Latitude - WDL.png|thumb|" A Plan of the West Line or Parallel of Latitude" by Charles Mason, 1768]]
The disputants engaged an expert British team, astronomer [[Charles Mason]] and surveyor [[Jeremiah Dixon]], to survey what became known as the Mason–Dixon line.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9573/ |title = A Plan of the West Line or Parallel of Latitude |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1768 |accessdate = 2013-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The men who drew the Mason–Dixon Line|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-40638673|accessdate=2 September 2017|work=BBC|date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It cost the Calverts of Maryland and the Penns of Pennsylvania £3,512 9/- (9 [[shillings]] 0 [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pence]]) to have {{convert|244|mi|km|0}} surveyed with such accuracy.

The Mason–Dixon line is made up of four segments corresponding to the terms of the settlement:

* the tangent line
* the north line
* the arc line
* the 39°43′ N parallel

The most difficult task was fixing the tangent line, as they had to confirm the accuracy of the transpeninsular line midpoint and the 12-mile circle, determine the tangent point along the circle, and then actually survey and monument the border. They then surveyed the north and arc lines. They did this work between 1763 and 1767. This actually left a small [[Wedge (border)|wedge of land]] in dispute between Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Annual Report of the Director | journal = U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey | year = 1895 | pages = 195 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JgEPAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq | accessdate = 2012-12-20| author1 = Coast And Geodetic Survey | first1 = U.S }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2012}}

In April 1765, Mason and Dixon began their survey of the more famous Maryland–Pennsylvania line. They were commissioned to run it for a distance of five degrees of longitude west from the Delaware River, fixing the western boundary of Pennsylvania (see the entry for [[Yohogania County]]). However, in October 1767, at [[Dunkard Creek]] near [[Mount Morris, Pennsylvania]], nearly {{convert|244|mi|km|0}} west of the Delaware, their [[Iroquois]] guides refused to go any further, having reached the border of their lands with the [[Lenape]], with whom they were engaged in hostilities. As such the group was forced to quit, and on October 11, they [[Mason and Dixon Survey Terminal Point|made their final observations]], {{convert|233|mi|km}} from their starting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Drawing the Line: How Mason and Dixon Surveyed the Most Famous Border in America | first= Edwin |last=Danson |publisher= John Wiley and Sons |year=2001 |pages=178–79 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dLDLuQ-xn34C&amp;pg=PA178| isbn= 9780471437048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1784, surveyors [[David Rittenhouse]] and [[Andrew Ellicott]] and their crew completed the survey of the Mason–Dixon line to the southwest corner of Pennsylvania, five degrees from the Delaware River.&lt;ref name=ellicott&gt;Four surveyors were appointed by each of the states: Virginia appointed [[James Madison (bishop)|Dr. James Madison]], Robert Andrews, [[John Page (Virginia politician)|John Page]], and [[Andrew Ellicott]], Pennsylvania appointed Dr. John Ewing (provost of University of Penn.), John Lukens (surveyor general of Penn.), [[Thomas Hutchins]], and [[David Rittenhouse]]. Andrews and Ellicott completed the west end of the line for Virginia, ({{cite book |last1=Mathews |first1=Catherine Van Courtlandt |authorlink1= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |title=Andrew Ellicott, His Life and Letters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpMNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA17  |year=1908 |publisher=The Grafton Press |location=New York |pages=17–19 }}) while Hutchins and Ewing did so for Pennsylvania. ({{cite book|last1=Hicks|first1=Fredrick|editor1-first=Fredrick |editor1-last=Hicks |title=A Topographical Description of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and North Carolina, reprinted from the original edition of 1778 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=irTRAAAAMAAJ |year=1904|publisher=The Burrow Brothers Company |location=Cleveland |page=32 |chapter=Biographical Sketch of Thomas Hutchins}})&lt;/ref&gt; Other surveyors continued west to the Ohio River. The section of the line between the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania and the river is the county line between [[Marshall County, West Virginia|Marshall]] and [[Wetzel County, West Virginia|Wetzel]] counties, West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/mason-dixon-line/ |title= Mason–Dixon Line{{!}} Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|date = 2014|accessdate = November 2015|website = The Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|publisher = Rutgers University|last= Strang |first= Cameron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mason–Dixon line has been resurveyed three times: in 1849, 1900, and in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt; On November 14, 1963, during the bicentennial of the Mason–Dixon line, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] opened a newly completed section of [[Interstate 95]] where it crossed the Maryland–Delaware border. It was one of his last public appearances before his [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]] in [[Dallas, Texas]]. The [[Delaware Turnpike]] and the [[John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway (Maryland)|Maryland portion]] of the new road were later designated as the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway.

==Systematic errors and experiments to weigh the Earth==
Mason and Dixon could only do the work as accurately as they did due to the work of [[Nevil Maskelyne]], some of whose instruments they used.&lt;ref name="davies"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=R.D|title=A Commemoration of Maskelyne at Schiehallion|journal=[[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=26|issue=3|pages=289–294|bibcode=1985QJRAS..26..289D|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was keen interest in their work and much communication between the surveyors, Maskelyne and other members of the British Scientific establishment in the [[Royal Society]] in Britain, notably [[Henry Cavendish]].&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;Note the comments on Cavendish's speculation in the introductory notes, and the multiple correspondences with Maskelyne in: {{Cite web|last=Mason|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Mason|author2=Dixon, Jeremiah |authorlink2=Jeremiah Dixon |title=The Journal of Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon 1763–1768 |url= http://www.mdlpp.org/pdf/library/JournalofMasonandDixon.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate= 2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maskelyne_fellowship"&gt;[[Nevil Maskelyne]] was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society|Royal Society Fellow]] on April 27, 1758; see {{Cite journal |url= http://royalsociety.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=4294972811 |format=pdf|publisher=[[Royal Society]]| title= List of Fellows of the Royal Society 1660–2007 |volume=K–Z|page=238 |year=2007 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cavendish_fellowship"&gt;[[Henry Cavendish]] was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society|Royal Society Fellow]] on May 1, 1760; see {{Cite journal|url=http://royalsociety.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=4294972811|format=pdf|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|title=List of Fellows of the Royal Society 1660–2007|volume=A–J|page=66|year=2007|accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During such survey work, it is normal to survey from point to point along the line and then survey back to the starting point,  where if there were no errors the origin and  re-surveyed position would coincide.&lt;ref name="natres"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Specifications and Recommendations for Control Surveys and Survey Markers|url=http://www.geod.nrcan.gc.ca/publications/specs/index_e.php#ExpectedAccuracy|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|page=TABLE E-VI POSITION DIFFERENCES|quote=Double run in straight line by helicopter between control spaced at 80 km.|date=December 27, 2007|accessdate=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Normally the return errors would be random – i.e. the return survey errors compared to the intermediate points back to the start point would be spatially randomly distributed around the start point.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Error Analysis: The Study of Uncertainties in Physical Measurements|last=Taylor|first=John Robert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giFQcZub80oC&amp;pg=PA94|page=94, §4.1 |isbn=0-935702-75-X|year=1999|publisher=University Science Books|accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mason and Dixon found that there were larger than expected [[systematic error]]s, i.e. non-[[random error|random]] errors, that led the return survey consistently being in one direction away from the starting point.&lt;ref name="mentzer"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Mentzer|first=Robert|title=How Mason and Dixon Ran Their Line|url=http://www.mdlpp.org/pdf/library/HowMasonandDixonRanTheirLine.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When this information got back to the Royal Society members, Henry Cavendish realised that this may have been due to the gravitational pull of the [[Allegheny Mountains]] deflecting the [[theodolite]] [[plumb-bob]]s and [[spirit level]]s.&lt;ref name="journal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="schaffer"&gt;{{Cite interview|last=Schaffer|first=Simon|subjectlink=Simon Schaffer|date=May 20, 2010 |work=[[BBC Radio 4]]|title=The Cavendish Family in Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tretkoff"/&gt;  Maskelyne then proposed measuring the gravitational force causing this deflection induced by the pull of a nearby mountain upon a plumb-bob in 1772 and sent Mason (who had returned to England) on a site survey through central England and Scotland to find a suitable location during the summer of 1773.&lt;ref name="maskelyne"&gt;{{Cite journal

Mr Mason selected for them a mountain at "the centre of Scotland",  [[Schiehallion]] – a wedge, with the summit ridge running nearly W – E, 3547 ft above sea level at its western summit, about 3000 ft at the E-end of the ridge; it presents steep faces to the trench to the N which contains Loch Rannoch and Loch Tummel, and to the deep Gleann Mor to the S. [An approximate altitude for Gleann Mor is 1500 feet, and for the land at the same distance to the north of the ridge is 1600 ft.]

==In culture==

===Name===
Mason and Dixon likely never heard the phrase, "Mason–Dixon line".  The official report on the survey, issued in 1768, did not even mention their names.&lt;ref name = WaPo /&gt;  While the term was used occasionally in the decades following the survey, it came into popular use when the [[Missouri Compromise]] named "Mason and Dixon's line" as part of the boundary between slave territory and free territory.&lt;ref&gt;John Mackenzie, "[http://www1.udel.edu/johnmack/mason_dixon/ A brief history of the Mason–Dixon Line]", APEC/CANR, University of Delaware; accessed 2017.01.05.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Symbolism===
In popular usage to people from the Northern United States, the Mason–Dixon line symbolizes a [[cultural boundary]] between the [[Northeastern United States|North]] and the [[Southern United States|South]] ([[Dixie]]). However, for many people who identify as Southern, Maryland is not considered a Southern state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are we Northern? Southern? Yes.|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-03-28/news/bal-md.backstory28mar28_1_southern-region-mason-dixon-line-western-maryland|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=March 28, 2010|last=Rasmussen|first=Frederick|accessdate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to confusion over terminology (for more on Maryland's position as southern or northern, see [[Dixie#Region|the Region section of the article on Dixie]]). Originally "Mason and Dixon's Line" referred to the border between Pennsylvania and Maryland. After [[History of slavery in Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania abolished slavery]], it served as a demarcation line for the legality of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]]. That demarcation did not extend beyond Pennsylvania because Delaware, then a [[slave state]], extended north and east of the boundary. Also lying north and east of the boundary was [[History of slavery in New Jersey|New Jersey]], where slavery was formally abolished in 1846, but former slaves continued to be "apprenticed" to their masters until the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1865.

The Missouri Compromise line ([[Parallel 36°30′ north]]) had a much clearer geographic connection to slavery in the [[History of the United States (1849–1865)|United States leading up to the Civil War]].&lt;ref name=ColoradoTerritory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.gov/dpa/doit/archives/territory.pdf |title=An Act to provide a temporary Government for the Territory of Colorado |format=[[PDF]] |publisher=[[Thirty-sixth United States Congress]] |date=February 28, 1861 |accessdate=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
Popular culture contains a multitude of references to the Mason–Dixon line as a general geographic division, or character names evoking it, although a minority of those specifically relate to the line itself.

====Film====
* Mason "The Line" Dixon is a leading character in ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' (2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=The Internet Movie Database |date=2006|title=Rocky Balboa|url=https://www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sixth film in the [[Rocky (film series)|Rocky franchise]], directed by and starring [[Sylvester Stallone]]. Played by real-life boxer [[Antonio Tarver]], Dixon is the current [[World Heavyweight Boxing Champion]] who is ridiculed for having never fought a real contender, and who thus agrees to an exhibition fight against the nearly 60-year-old Rocky Balboa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Empire Magazine |title=Film Review|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Attack of the Killer Tomatoes]]'', Mason Dixon is the leader of a government task force dedicated to stopping the worldwide crisis when tomatoes turn malignant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonappetit.com/entertaining-style/pop-culture/article/attack-of-the-killer-tomatoes-an-oral-history-of-the-1978-film|title=Attack of the Killer Tomatoes: An Oral History of the 1978 Film|first=Sam|last=Dean|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri]]'' the racist cop played by [[Sam Rockwell]] is named "Jason Dixon".

====Cartoons====
The line makes several appearances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://yosemite-sam.net/ |date=2017|title= still from the cartoon "southern fried rabbit" showing the line |url=http://yosemite-sam.net/Sam/Animated-Cartoons/Southern-Fried-Rabbit-04.JPG}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in the 1953  [[Bugs Bunny]] cartoon "[[Southern Fried Rabbit]]". The line separates the drought affected North from which the "Yankee" Bugs leaves in search of carrots in the green lands of the "Dixie" south, the latter being guarded by [[Yosemite Sam]].

====Literature====
*In the novel ''[[The People's Choice (novel)|People's Choice]]'' by [[Jeff Greenfield]], the character of W. Dixon Mason is an African-American preacher who plays a major role in determining the next U.S. President when the elected candidate dies between the popular election and the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] formal vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-399-13812-6|title=Fiction Book Review: People's Choice by Jeff Greenfield, Author  Putnam Publishing Group $22.95 (309p) ISBN 978-0-399-13812-6|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2016}}
*''[[Mason &amp; Dixon]]'' (1997) is the title of a novel by American author [[Thomas Pynchon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times |title= Book review - Mason &amp; Dixon |date= 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The novel meanders widely through the lives of Mason and Dixon, traditional American history, and other themes such as [[hollow earth theory]], [[geomancy]], [[deism]], and{{spaced ndash}}perhaps{{spaced ndash}}[[alien abduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mason &amp; Dixon |website=ThomasPynchon.com|url=http://www.thomaspynchon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music====
* The 1918 song, "[[Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody]]", written by [[Jean Schwartz]] and popularized by [[Al Jolson]], includes the lyric ''Just hang my cradle, Mammy mine/ Right on that Mason–Dixon Line''.
* A small group of musicians from Paul Whiteman's orchestra led by C melody saxophonist [[Frank Trumbauer]] and including [[Bix Beiderbecke]] recorded two sides for Columbia on May 15, 1929 titled, "Alabammy Snow" and "What A Day!" under the pseudonym, "Mason–Dixon Orchestra".&lt;ref&gt;Discography of American Historical Recordings, s.v. "Columbia 1861-D (10-in. double-faced)," accessed August 30, 2017, http://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/object/detail/196765/Columbia_1861-D.&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable that they chose this pseudonym because the catalog number of the record would be 1861-D, 1861 being the year that the American Civil War began.
* The lyric "First to cross the Mason–Dixon line" features in the opening verse of the song "I've done it again" (composers [[Marianne Faithfull]] / [[Barry Reynolds]]) on [[Grace Jones]]' 1981 album Nightclubbing.  [[Nightclubbing (Grace Jones album)]]
* The Mason–Dixon line provides the main narrative for the song "Sailing to Philadelphia"  (featuring [[James Taylor]])  by British singer-songwriter and guitarist [[Mark Knopfler]].
* The 1955 song, "[[Hey, Porter]]", by [[Johnny Cash]] makes reference to the Mason–Dixon line in the line, ''How much longer will it be until we cross that Mason-Dixon line?''
*[[The_Shires_(duo)|The Shires]] 2015 song "State Lines" includes the lyrics "Like when you roll your eyes like a cool new Yorker, Driving across the Mason–Dixon line"

==== Sports ====
* In the regional baseball rivalry between [[Yankees–Red Sox rivalry|the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox]], the theoretical border that separates population centers that are majority-Red Sox fans from majority-Yankees fans in Connecticut is sometimes called the "Munson-Nixon Line"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/23/upshot/24-upshot-baseball.html|title=Up Close on Baseball’s Borders|last=Giratikanon|first=Tom|date=2014-04-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-25|last2=Katz|first2=Josh|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|last3=Leonhardt|first3=David|last4=Quealy|first4=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2013/12/16/106408077/reconcilable-differences|title=Reconcilable Differences|last=RUSHIN|first=STEVE|work=SI.com|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://spectator.org/58867_baseballs-borders/|title=Baseball's Borders|date=2014-04-25|work=The American Spectator|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in a reference to the Mason–Dixon line.

'''Melkki''' is an island in [[Helsinki]], the capital of [[Finland]]. It is located approximately 500 meters south of [[Lauttasaari]]. The island was formerly used by [[Finnish Army]] and access to the island was limited.&lt;ref name="melkki"&gt;[http://www.helsinginuutiset.fi/artikkeli/253560-autottomaan-saareen-jopa-5-000-asukasta-lue-helsingin-villi-visio Autottomaan saareen jopa 5 000 asukasta – lue Helsingin villi visio] Retrieved on 7 November 2015 (in Finnish)&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Helsinki is currently proposing that the island could be future home for 4000-5000 residents. The island would be served only by ferries and a bridge connection is not under consideration.&lt;ref name="melkki" /&gt;

The '''multiverse''' is a series of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] in many of the [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] [[novel]]s and [[Short story|short stories]] written by [[Michael Moorcock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  |quote= Some of Moorcock's genre fiction is borderline SF, though most of it is better described as fantasy. One of the most impressive aspects of this achievement is the way in which he has linked much of his fiction together into one monumental sequence, The Tale of The Eternal Champion. Central to this ongoing series is Moorcock's concept of the Multiverse. The Multiverse was introduced in Moorcock's early novel ''The Sundered Worlds'' and is an imaginative construct of transitorally intersecting parallel and alternate worlds, an infinite series of concurrent, sometimes intertwined universes between which the Eternal Champion moves.  This Multiverse concept has been accepted by Physics as the Many World Theorem lending authenticity to Moorcock's ideas.  The idea that there are an infinite number of worlds as real as our own provides quite the platform for elaboration and conjecture by authors of today and tomorrow.  Moorcock's multiverse stands as perhaps the first exploration of these many worlds and the possibilities within"

|quote= A term coined by Michael Moorcock (also, earlier and independently by John Cowper Powys) to describe a universe consisting of innumerable alternate worlds, all intersecting, laterally and (palimpsest-fashion) vertically. Some of these parallel worlds operate according to SF premises, some – like the worlds in which various avatars of Moorcock's Eternal Champion series play out their linked destinies - operate in fantasy terms. Worlds governed by incompatible premises are not, however, barred from each other and in this sense the overall concept belongs more properly to fantasy than to Sf. Moorcock himself treats his extremely large and varied oeuvre as though all its venues occupy niches in the one multiverse.

Central to these works is the concept of an [[Eternal Champion (character)|Eternal Champion]] who has potentially multiple identities across multiple dimensions. The multiverse contains a legion of different versions of Earth in various times, histories, and occasionally, sizes. One example is the world in which his [[Elric]] Saga takes place. The multiplicity of places in this collection of universes include [[Melniboné]], [[Tanelorn]], the [[Young Kingdoms]], and the Realm of Dreams.

[[File:The French Ormolu Clock.JPG|thumb|The French ormolu clock]]
The town of [[Toodyay, Western Australia]] was not always known by that name. Initially Toodyay was located in what is now [[West Toodyay]] before repeated flooding caused the town centre to migrate to the area around the [[Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot (1852-1872)|Newcastle convict depot]] creating the town of Newcastle. After approximately 50 years of confusion the name of Newcastle was changed to Toodyay and the original Toodyay became known as West Toodyay.
 
==Toodyay locations==
The original townsite of Toodyay was determined in 1836.  Following serious flooding in 1857 and 1859, the decision was made to transfer the town to the site of the Toodyay Convict Depot located approximately {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} upstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cromb |first=A. |year=2010 |title=The History of the Toodyay Convict Depot |url= |location= |publisher= |pages= 87|isbn=978-0-646-52963-9 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new township, to be known as Newcastle, was gazetted on 1 October 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{Gazette WA

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name "Newcastle" was derived from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Erickson |first=Rica |date=1974 |title=Old Toodyay and Newcastle |url= |location=|publisher=Toodyay Shire Council |pages=165 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The township of "Old" Toodyay continued to exist, although it ceased to expand.

In August 1909, the Federal authorities urged the town of Newcastle to change its name.  The towns of [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in [[New South Wales]] and Newcastle in Western Australia were being confused. All too often the problem of duplicated place names was causing mail to go astray.

One instance of mail going astray concerned an item discovered by Sir [[John Forrest]].  A beautiful French [[ormolu]] clock had been delivered mistakenly to Newcastle, New South Wales, where it had sat unclaimed. Forrest recognised that the clock belonged to [[William Amed Demasson|William Demasson]] of Newcastle, Western Australia, and arranged for it to be restored to its rightful owner. This incident is known to have contributed to the call for change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Erickson |first=Rica |date=1974 |title=Old Toodyay and Newcastle |url= |location= |publisher=Toodyay Shire Council |pages=355 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1910, the Municipal Council held a referendum and, by a slim majority, it was decided to change the name of the town to Toodyay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Erickson |first=Rica |date=1974 |title=Old Toodyay and Newcastle |url= |location= |publisher=Toodyay Shire Council |pages=355, 356 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 6 May 1910, it was declared that the town of Newcastle would henceforth be known as Toodyay and the old town of Toodyay would henceforth be known as [[West Toodyay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Gazette WA|file=8365/09|date=6 May 1910|page=1910:1043|title=Change of Name. Newcastle and Toodyay Townsites.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French Ormolu clock, long held by the Demasson family, was purchased by the [[National Trust of Western Australia]] in 1987.  In turn, the clock, together with its documents was offered to the [[Toodyay Historical Society]]. On 21 October 2007, the clock was welcomed back to the town of Toodyay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cromb |first=Alison |date=2010 |title=The History of the Toodyay Convict Depot |url= |location= |publisher=self published |pages=116 |isbn=978-0-646-52963-9 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toodyay definitions==
There are no records for the meaning of the origin of the name ''Toodyay'' which derives from ''Toodye'' or ''Duidgee'' in the Noongar language.&lt;ref name=anthro&gt;{{cite web|title=Duidgee – A little bird's song|url=http://www.anthropologyfromtheshed.com/assets/Duidgee-Bird-Call-FINAL-21-12-2011.pdf|accessdate=9 March 2014|author=Ken Macintyre and Dr Barbara Dobson|date=21 Dec 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1929 during [[Centenary of Western Australia|Western Australia's centennial year]], [[Victor Riseley]] published an article in ''[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]]'' in response to other publications during the year that had tried to define its origins. Riseley contended that the definition of "beautiful", while the perfect description of the region, was not a descriptive for which the Ballardong people had any use, as their place names were related to the necessities of daily life. Riseley concluded that Toodyay was derived from Tooyeep, the wife of one of the trackers who accompanied [[George Fletcher Moore]] in 1836 to the valley known as [[Chittering, Western Australia|Gabbia-Yandirt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58367739 |title=The Origin of Toodyay. |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]] |location=Perth |date=24 November 1929 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |page=10 Section: First Section |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible origin is that ''toodyay'' is derived from an account written by [[James Drummond (botanist)|James Drummond]] of a party taking up land grants in the region in 1836. On Friday, they camped at the boundary of Anderson's grant. The following day they proceeded onto Drummond's grant. Upon finding an area of good land and water, their guide Babbing said the area was known as ''Duidgee''. This area was said to be a favourite of the Ballardong people because of the abundance of [[Typha|reed mace]], whose thick roots are a good source of starch and mucilage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article640436 |title=Observations on the Projected New Line of Road to Northam |last=Drummond |first=Mr. James |newspaper=[[The Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal]] |location=WA |date=28 May 1836 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |page=702 |publisher=National Library of Australia}} Note: Drummond's writings do not mention any meaning for the word ''duidgee'' though other words were defined in this work.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A third possibility was that the name is derived from the song of the [[restless flycatcher]] (''Myiagra inquieta'') which is said to sound like ''duidjee-duidjee'' or ''toodjee-toodjee''. This bird is found commonly in the region as well as the Canning region where Babbing grew up. Anthropologists Ken Macintyre and Barb Dobson speculate that Babbing was describing the sound of a bird. Drummond didn't enquire into the meaning of the word, as he did for other words during his account of the 1836 journey. Macintyre and Dobson note that Toodyeep was from the area but that Aboriginal people were named after the place where they were born or raised rather than the place being named after them and therefore dismiss this as a possible origin for the name Toodyay.&lt;ref name=anthro /&gt;

By 1842 Drummond in his correspondence was referring to the area as ''Toodyay'' while referring to ''Duidgee Catta'' as the name of a pool on his estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article65582039 |title=Correspondence. |newspaper=[[The Inquirer (Perth)|The Inquirer]] |location=Perth |date=28 September 1842 |accessdate=10 March 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3117">The '''National Street Gazetteer''' is a public database that is kept private, of all streets in England and Wales compiled from the responsible highway authorities which is restricted to local authorities and statutory undertakers (e.g. for maintenance or installing services).

In the United Kingdom local authorities have responsibility for the creation and maintenance of streets as well as the management of street works. The NSG brings together the knowledge spread across local authorities and is a repository for combining the Local Street Gazetteers they are required to keep. Maintenance of the NSG is covered by the National Streetworks Register legislation and is a statutory requirement of local authorities.

In effect the NSG has become the definitive list of all streets in England and Wales and provides a definitive identification of all streets with the use of a Unique Street Reference Number (USRN).

On a monthly basis highway authorities are required to upload their street gazetteers, along with Associated Street Data (ASD), to the NSG; a master index built to the national standard BS 7666, for access by a number of other organisations via the NSG online hub and managed by [[GeoPlace]]. This enables third party organisations such as public utilities to meet their statutory requirements to provide the appropriate streetworks notifications.

The NSG has exceeded its initial aims to provide a consistent and unambiguous identification of streets and their associated streetworks. The street gazetteer has become a foundation for the [[National Land and Property Gazetteer]]. It has also become the basis for [[Transport for London]]'s (TfL) road network through the Pan London Street Gazetteer.

Originally the NSG was managed by the national mapping agency for the UK, Ordnance Survey (OS). However, it became clear that OS was unwilling or unable to provide a rigorous management of the service.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Part of this may have been because OS was operating outside of their acknowledged expertise in mapping rather than data management, although it has been suggested {{who|date=November 2012}} that OS simply saw no commercial advantage in developing the NSG.

In May 2005 the [[Mapping Services Agreement]] (MSA) was signed with local authorities. This was part of a long drawn out process of procurement for mapping data and included management of the NSG and the NLPG. The outcome of agreement involved the loss of the custodianship by OS of the NSG which was awarded to the data management company [[Intelligent Addressing Ltd]] who were already managers of the NLPG.

'''Sir Peter Geoffrey Hall''', [[British Academy|FBA]] (19 March 1932 – 30 July 2014) was an English [[urban planning|town planner]], [[urbanist]] and [[human geography|geographer]]. He was the Bartlett Professor of Planning and Regeneration at [[The Bartlett]], [[University College London]]&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;[http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/people/?school=planning&amp;upi=PGHAL68 Prof. Sir Peter Hall, Bartlett School of Planning]&lt;/ref&gt; and president of both the [[Town and Country Planning Association]] and the [[Regional Studies Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Studies Association|url=http://www.regional-studies-assoc.ac.uk/ Regional Studies Association|website=www.regional-studies-assoc.ac.uk|accessdate=4 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218192311/http://www.regional-studies-assoc.ac.uk/|archivedate=18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was known internationally for his studies and writings on the economic, demographic, cultural and management issues that face cities around the globe. Hall was for many years a planning and regeneration adviser to successive UK governments. He was Special Adviser on Strategic Planning to the [[British government]] (1991–94) and a member of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's Urban Task Force (1998–1999).&lt;ref name="Bartlett"/&gt; Hall is considered by many to be the father of the industrial [[enterprise zone]] concept, adopted by countries worldwide to develop industry in disadvantaged areas.

==Biography==
Hall was born in [[Hampstead]], north London, England. In 1940, his family moved to [[Blackpool]], when his father, a clerical officer in the pensions service, was relocated. Hall attended [[Blackpool Grammar School]] and then graduated from [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]], with a master's degree and Doctorate in Geography before starting his academic career in 1957 as lecturer at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/jun/20/regeneration.communities Interview in ''The Guardian'', 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hall was married to Carla Wartenberg from 1962 to 1966, and Magdalena Mróz from 1967 until his death. He died in London on 30 July 2014 at the age of 82.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtpi.org.uk/briefing-room/news-releases/2014/july/rtpi-pays-tribute-to-sir-peter-hall/ RTPI, "RTPI pays tribute to Sir Peter Hall", 31 July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; There are many obituaries to his career and impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a4610ob |title=Peter Hall Obituary in Environment and Planning A |accessdate=2014-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic work==
In a 1977 address to the [[Royal Town Planning Institute]], Hall put forth the idea of a "Freeport" in the city, a concept that would come to be known as an Enterprise Zone.&lt;ref name=cities&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Peter|title=Cities of Tomorrow: An Intellectual History of Urban Planning and Design Since 1880|date=17 April 2014|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-45650-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enterprise Zones were to be open to immigration of capital and people, without taxes or bureaucracy, modeled after [[Hong Kong]] in the 1950s. In practice, Enterprise Zones became areas where taxes were waived and development highly subsidized.&lt;ref name=cities /&gt; 
 
In his final years, Hall strongly perceived that British planners had fallen behind their European counterparts. His last book ''Good Cities: Better Lives'' and last book chapter "The Strange Death of British Planning: And How to Bring About a Miraculous Revival", both published in 2014, stress this point and seek to direct attention to planning examples from mainland Europe. His vision of clusters of existing towns and new garden cities to form new dynamic city regions in the north-west, the Midlands and the south-east of England won his team a commendation in the [[Wolfson Economics Prize]] competition in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theplanner.co.uk/features/peter-hall-master-planner Simon Wicks, "Peter Hall: Master Planner", The Planner, 08/09/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours and awards ==
[[File:The Professor Sir Peter Hall Overground train.jpg|alt=The Professor Sir Peter Hall Overground train|thumb|The Professor Sir Peter Hall Overground train]]
Hall was [[knight]]ed in 1998 for services to the Town and Country Planning Association. He was awarded the [[Vautrin Lud International Geography Prize]] in 2001; the Royal Town Planning Institute Gold Medal and the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Founder's Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for distinction in research in 2003; and the [[Balzan Prize]] for the ''Social and Cultural History of Cities since the Beginning of the 16th Century'' in 2005. He won the last award ''"for his unique contribution to the history of ideas about urban planning, his acute analysis of the physical, social and economic problems of modern cities and his powerful historical investigations into the cultural creativity of city life."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0509/05092301 UCL News on Balzan Prize 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; He also won the [[Regional Studies Association|Regional Studies]] Prize for Overall Contribution to the Field of Regional Studies in 2008.

Hall also received an Honorary Doctorate from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/annual-review/2002/people.htm#4|title=Heriot--Watt University Edinburgh &amp; Scottish Borders: Annual Review 2002|website=www1.hw.ac.uk|access-date=2016-03-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413145419/http://www1.hw.ac.uk/annual-review/2002/people.htm#4|archivedate=13 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 2015, [[Transport for London]] dedicated a train in recognition of his contribution to London's transport infrastructure. The train, Number 378 204, is a five-carriage London Overground train.&lt;ref&gt;University College London, News, "TfL names London Overground train in honour of Sir Peter Hall" [https://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/planning/news/peter-hall-train-dedication]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Planning Magazine, "Diary", Issue 2014, 9 October 2015, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Podesta''' is a [[phantom island]] reported at {{coord|32|14|S|89|08|W|display=inline,title}} by the [[Italian people|Italian]] Captain Pinocchio of the vessel ''[[Barone Podestà]]'' ([[Hereward Carrington]], ''Carrington Collection'', page 21) in 1879 claiming it to be just over a kilometre in circumference located 1390 km due west of [[El Quisco]], [[Chile]]. It was originally located 900 miles west of [[Chile]]'s coast. The island was charted falsely until 1935, when it was removed from charts (marked "Existence Doubtful" by Defense Mapping Agency's 1975 [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/onc/txu-pclmaps-oclc-8322829_r_22.jpg Operation Navigational Chart R-22]). The island has not been found since.

An island near [[Easter Island]] was sighted in 1912 but was likewise never seen again. [[Sarah Ann Island]] northwest of [[Easter Island]] was another island also removed from naval charts when a search in 1932 failed to find it.

[[file:Волжские утесы с Дурман горы.jpg|thumb|250px|Landscape shaped by erosion rill. [[Volgograd Oblast]], Russia.]]
In [[Geomorphology#Hillslope processes|hillslope geomorphology]], a '''rill''' is a shallow [[Channel (geography)|channel]] (no more than a few tens of centimetres deep) cut into [[soil]] by the [[erosion|erosive]] action of [[Overland flow|flowing water]]. Similar but smaller incised channels are known as microrills; larger incised channels are known as [[gully|gullies]].

'''Artificial rills''' are  [[Channel (geography)|channels]] constructed to carry a [[water supply]] from a distant water source. In landscape or [[garden]] design, constructed rills are an [[aesthetic]] [[water feature]].

==Rills created by erosion==
[[File:Rill close-up from Tyrone, Ireland.jpg|thumb|left|Water flowing in an actively-[[erosion|eroding]] '''rill''' on bare [[farmland]] in [[Tyrone|County Tyrone]], [[Northern Ireland]]]]
[[File:Rill network from Tyrone, Ireland.jpg|thumb|right|A downslope view of part of the [[erosion|eroding]] '''rill''' network from [[Tyrone|County Tyrone]], [[Northern Ireland]]. See left for a close-up view of a single rill]]
Rills are narrow and shallow [[Channel_(geography)|channels]] which are [[erosion|eroded]] into unprotected [[soil]] by hillslope [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. Since soil is regularly left bare during [[agriculture|agricultural operations]], rills may form on [[farmland]] during these vulnerable periods. Rills may also form when bare soil is left exposed following [[deforestation]], or during [[construction]] activities. 

Rills are fairly easily visible when first incised, so they are often the first indication of an ongoing [[erosion]] problem. Unless [[soil conservation]] measures are put into place, rills on regularly eroding areas may eventually develop into larger [[erosion|erosional]] features such as [[gully|gullies]] or even (in [[semi-arid]] regions) into [[badlands]].

===Rill initiation===
Rills are created when water erodes the topsoil on hillsides, and so are significantly affected by seasonal weather patterns. They tend to appear more often in rainier months.&lt;ref&gt;Fullen, M.A. &amp; A.H. Reed. 1987. Rill Erosion on Arable Loamy Sands in the West Midlands of England. Bryan, R.B. (ed). Rill Erosion: Processes and Significance. Catena Supplement 8. W. Germany:Catena Verlag. 85-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Rills begin to form when the runoff shear stress, the ability of surface runoff to detach soil particles, overcomes the soil’s shear strength, the ability of soil to resist force working parallel to the soil’s surface. This begins the erosion process as water breaks soil particles free and carries them down the slope.&lt;ref&gt;Torri, D., M. Sfalanga &amp; G. Chisci. 1987. Threshold Conditions for Incipient Rilling. Bryan, R.B. (ed). Rill Erosion: Processes and Significance. Catena Supplement 8. W. Germany:Catena Verlag. 97-105.&lt;/ref&gt; These forces explain why sandy, loamy soils are especially susceptible to the formation of rills, whereas dense clays tend to resist rill formation.&lt;ref&gt;Loch, R.J. &amp; E.C. Thomas. 1987. Resistance to Rill Erosion: Observations on the Efficiency of Rill Erosion on a Tilled Clay Soil Under Simulated Rain and Run-On Water. Bryan, R.B. (ed). Rill Erosion: Processes and Significance. Catena Supplement 8. W. Germany:Catena Verlag. 71-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rill_initiation,_finger_pointing_at_a_newly-developed_headcut.jpeg|thumb|left|Rill initiation: the finger is pointing at a [[headcut]] which has just been incised by [[Surface runoff|runoff]] which is flowing from right to left]]

Rills cannot form on every surface, and their formation is intrinsically connected to the steepness of the hillside slope. Gravity determines the force of the water, which provides the power required to start the erosional environment necessary to create rills. Therefore, the formation of rills is primarily controlled by the slope of the hillside. Slope controls the depth of the rills, while the length of the slope and the soil’s permeability control the number of incisions in an area. Each type of soil has a threshold value, a slope angle below which water velocity cannot produce sufficient force to dislodge enough soil particles for rills to form.&lt;ref&gt;Planchon, O., E. Fritcsh &amp; C. Valentin. 1987. Rill Development in a Wet Savannah Environment. Bryan, R.B. (ed). Rill Erosion: Processes and Significance. Catena Supplement 8. W. Germany:Catena Verlag. 55-70.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, on many non-cohesive slopes, this threshold value hovers around an angle of 2 degrees with a [[shear velocity]] between 3 and 3.5&amp;nbsp;cm/s.&lt;ref&gt;Rauws, G. 1987. The Initiation of Rills on Plane Beds of Non-Cohesive Sediments. Catena Supplement 8. W. Germany:Catena Verlag. 107-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

After rills begin forming, they are subjected to variety of other erosional forces which may increase their size and output volume. Up to 37% of erosion in a rill-ridden area may derive from mass movement, or collapse, of rill sidewalls. As water flows through a rill, it will undercut into the walls, triggering collapse. Also, as water seeps into the soil of the walls, they weaken, amplifying the chance of wall collapse. The erosion created by these forces increases the size of the rill while also swelling its output volume.&lt;ref&gt;Govers, G. 1987. Spatial and Temporal Variability in Rill Development Processes at the Huldenberg Experimental Site. Catena Supplement 8. W. Germany:Catena Verlag. 17-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less commonly, [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] of [[limestone]] and other soluble rocks by slightly [[Rainfall#Acidity|acidic rainfall]] and [[Surface runoff|runoff]] also results in the formation of rill-like features on the surface of the rock.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, D.C. &amp; J. Lundberg. 1987. A Review of Dissolutional Rills in Limestone and Other Soluble Rocks. Bryan, R.B. (ed). Rill Erosion: Processes and Significance. Catena Supplement 8. W. Germany:Catena Verlag. 119-139&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance of rill erosion===
Although rills are small, they transport significant amounts of soil each year. Some estimates claim rill flow has a carrying capacity of nearly ten times that of non-rill, or interrill, areas. In a moderate rainfall, rill flow can carry rock fragments up to 9&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter downslope. In 1987, scientist J. Poesen conducted an experiment on the Huldenberg field in Belgium which revealed that during a moderate rainfall, rill erosion removed as much as 200&amp;nbsp;kg (in submerged weight) of rock.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Poesen, J. 1987. Transport of Rock Fragments by Rill Flow—A Field Study. Catena Supplement 8. W. Germany:Catena Verlag. 35-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the considerable effect rills have on landscapes often negatively impact human activity. Rills have been observed washing away archaeological sites.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; They are also very common in agricultural areas because sustained agriculture depletes the soil of much of its organic content, increasing the erodibility of the soil. Agricultural machines, such as tractors, compact the soil to the point where water flows over the surface rather than seeping into the soil. Tractor wheel impressions often channel water, providing a perfect environment for the generation of rills. If left alone, these rills may erode considerable amounts of arable soil.&lt;ref&gt;Fullen, M.A. &amp; A.H. Reed. 1987. Rill Erosion of Arable Loamy Sands in the West Midlands of England. Catena Supplement 8. W. Germany:Catena Verlag. 85-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under proper field management rills are small and are easily repaired by contour tilling the soil. This will prevent, for a time at least, the rills from growing and eroding the landscape more rapidly with time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dhn.iihr.uiowa.edu/runoff/erosion.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628182919/http://dhn.iihr.uiowa.edu/runoff/erosion.htm |archivedate=2010-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Dutch Geographical Society''', or ''[[Koninklijk]] Nederlands Aardrijkskundig Genootschap'' (KNAG) in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], is an organization of [[geography|geographers]] and those interested in geography in [[The Netherlands]]. It has about 4000 members and sponsors lectures on geography. It publishes a scientific magazine, ''[[Tijdschrift voor economische en sociale geografie]]'' (Journal of Economic &amp; Social Geography)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0040-747X&amp;site=1 ''Tijdschrift voor economische en sociale geografie (Journal of Economic &amp; Social Geography)''], Edited by:
Bouke van Gorp (Executive Editor) and Frank van Oort (Editor-in-Chief), [[Wiley Publishing]] website&lt;/ref&gt; and  Nederlandse Geografische Studies or NGS (Dutch Geographical Studies). It also has a large collection of about 135,000 maps and 4500 atlases which have been housed at a library at the [[University of Amsterdam]] since 1880. 

==History==
The organization was founded in 1873 after the founding of comparable organizations in [[France]] in 1821 ([[Société de Géographie]])  and the [[United Kingdom]] in 1830 ( [[Royal Geographical Society]]). [[Pieter Johannes Veth]] was the first chairman of the KNAG. It organized several expeditions to [[Surinam]], islands in the [[Dutch Indies]]  [[archipelago]], [[South Africa]] and even to visit the indigenous tribes in [[North America]]. Most  expeditions consisted of scientists from different disciplines, a photographer and a naval officer. Sometimes a larger military contingent was necessary if the expedition was travelling to a more dangerous area. 

The members of the organization were not just scientists. The political elite  and the commercial elite (bankers, factory owners, ship owners and captains of merchant ships) were members. It had an economic agenda as well as a scientific mission. 

As Dutch colonies became independent, the work of the KNAG focused less and less on economic issues, and became more and more concerned with scientific questions. The [[Dutch East Indies]] became independent in 1949 and [[Netherlands New Guinea]] became independent in 1962. The last expedition of the KNAG was in 1959 to Netherlands New Guinea.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8603">A '''runoff footprint''' is the total [[surface runoff]] that a site produces over the course of a year. According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), stormwater is "rainwater and melted snow that runs off streets, lawns, and other sites." &lt;ref&gt;EPA Stormwater Management http://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/stormwater/&lt;/ref&gt; Urbanized areas with high concentrations of [[impervious surface]]s like buildings, roads, and driveways produce large volumes of runoff which can lead to flooding, sewer overflows, and poor [[water quality]]. Since soil in urban areas can be compacted and have a low [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration rate]], the surface runoff estimated in a runoff footprint is not just from impervious surfaces, but also pervious areas including yards. The total runoff is a measure of the site’s contribution to stormwater issues in an area, especially in urban areas with sewer overflows. Completing a runoff footprint for a site allows a property owner to understand what areas on his or her site are producing the most runoff and what scenarios of stormwater green solutions like [[Rainwater tank|rain barrels]] and [[rain gardens]] are most effective in mitigating this runoff and its costs to the community.

== Significance ==

The runoff footprint is the stormwater equivalent to the carbon/energy footprint. When homeowners or business owners complete an energy audit or carbon footprint, they understand how they are consuming energy and learn how this consumption can be reduced through [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]] measures. Correspondingly, the runoff footprint allows someone to calculate their baseline annual runoff and assess what the impact of ideal stormwater green solutions would be for their site. Since the passage of the [[Clean Water Act]] in 1972, the EPA has monitored and regulated stormwater issues in urban areas. Municipalities across the United States are now required to upgrade sanitary and stormwater systems to meet EPA mandates. The total cost for these upgrades across the United States exceeds $3000 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/epa_us_needs_300_billion_in_se.html Syracuse.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Municipalities across the United States need $300 billion in sewer, water upgrades http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/epa_us_needs_300_billion_in_se.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The stormwater runoff from every property in an area can contribute to the overall stormwater issues including overflows and water pollution. Stormwater runoff carries nonpoint source pollution which is a leading cause of water quality issues.&lt;ref&gt;EPA - What is Nonpoint Source Pollution? http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/whatis.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

By completing a runoff footprint, homeowners and business owners can consider how stormwater green solutions can reduce runoff on-site. Stormwater green solutions (also called green infrastructure) use "vegetation, soils, and natural processes to manage water and create healthier urban environments.  At the scale of a city or county, green infrastructure refers to the patchwork of natural areas that provides habitat, flood protection, cleaner air, and cleaner water. At the scale of a neighborhood or site, green infrastructure refers to stormwater management systems that mimic nature by soaking up and storing water".&lt;ref&gt;What is Green Infrastructure? http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/greeninfrastructure/gi_what.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Stormwater green solutions include bioswales (directional rain gardens), cisterns, green roofs, permeable pavement, rain barrels, and rain gardens. According to the EPA, onsite stormwater green solutions or [[Low-impact development (UK)|low-impact development]]s (LIDs) can significantly reduce runoff and costly stormwater/sewer infrastructure upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;EPA - Reducing Stormwater Costs http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/green/costs07_index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Stormwater green solutions can also reduce energy consumption. Treating and pumping water is an energy-intensive activity. According to the River Network, the U.S. consumes at least 521 million MWh a year for water-related purposes which is the equivalent to 13% of the nation’s electricity consumption &lt;ref&gt;River Network. The Carbon Footprint of Water. http://www.rivernetwork.org/resource-library/carbon-footprint-water&lt;/ref&gt; Potable water must be treated and then pumped to the consumer. Wastewater is treated before being discharged. In areas with combined sewer systems or old separate sewer systems with high [[Infiltration/Inflow|inflow and infiltration]], stormwater is also treated at the wastewater treatment facilities. By capturing stormwater runoff onsite in rain barrels and cisterns, the consumption of potable water for irrigation and its corresponding energy impact can be reduced. The reduction of runoff from all types of stormwater green solutions reduces the stormwater that may end up at the wastewater treatment facility in areas with combined sewer systems or old separate sewers.

== Completing a Runoff Footprint ==

There are number of methods available to complete a Runoff Footprint. The simplest methods involve using a runoff coefficient, which according to the State Water Resources Control Board of California is "a dimensionless coefficient relating the amount of runoff to the amount of precipitation received. It is a larger value for areas with low infiltration and high runoff (pavement, steep gradient), and lower for permeable, well vegetated areas (forest, flat land)."&lt;ref&gt;Runoff Coefficient (C) Fact Sheet http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/docs/cwt/guidance/513.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The runoff coefficients for different surface types on a site can be multiplied with the area for each surface along with the annual precipitation to generate a rough runoff footprint. If the runoff coefficient and areas of proposed stormwater green solutions like rain gardens and bioswales for the site are known, the reduction in overall runoff from these improvements can be estimated.

More accurate Runoff Footprint tools exist. By using computer modeling and detailed weather data, complex runoff footprints can be made easy. The amounts of pollution in the stormwater runoff can be estimated, and the effects of combinations of stormwater green solutions can be assessed. The James River Association of central Virginia provides an [http://www.jamesriverassociation.org/get-involved/runoff-calculator/ online tool] where property owners in the James River watershed can generate a site-specific runoff pollution report.&lt;ref&gt;JRA - Do you know What’s in Your Runoff? http://www.jamesriverassociation.org/get-involved/runoff-calculator/&lt;/ref&gt; MyRunoff.org provides an online [http://www.myrunoff.org runoff footprint calculator] for property owners across the United States to estimate their baseline runoff and the reduction from different scenarios of rain barrels and rain gardens.&lt;ref&gt;MyRunoff.org's Runoff Footprint Calculator. http://myrunoff.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA launched the National Stormwater Calculator in July, 2013, which is a desktop application for Windows allowing users to model the annual impact of a range of stormwater green solutions.&lt;ref&gt;National Stormwater Calculator http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/wq/models/swc/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen Sargent Visher''' (1887-1967) was an American regional geographer and [[eugenicist]]. He spent most of his academic career as Professor of Geography at [[Indiana University]], Department of Geology. His interests included the geography of intelligence, ecology and the historical geography of Indiana – on which he wrote prolifically (C. Lavery, 2015). After his death he was called the "Mr Geography of Indiana" as a result of the many articles and books he wrote concerning the Hoosier State (J. Rose, 1971). His interests in eugenics influenced in the work of [[Ellsworth Huntington]], while his geographical work and stories of eastern travel was one of the main reasons Pulitzer Prize winning war correspondent Ernie Pyle began traveling to the Far East (O. Johnson, 2011).

==Early life==
Visher was born in Chicago to a second generation Dutch immigrant (father) and a [[New Hampshire]] native (mother). Irregular school attendance did not diminish his interest in the physical environment, human settlement and animal and [[plant ecology]] (C. Harris, 1968). His early interest in these fields laid the foundations for his later research into the influence of the environment on humanity (C. Lavery, 2015). He spent most of his teenage years living between [[South Dakota]] and [[Chicago]] – where he attended the Lewis Institute to pursue a course in [[geology]] and [[biology]]. He was then awarded an undergraduate degree in botany and a master's degree in geology at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1910.

==Geographical work==
Visher's early geographical work was heavily influenced by [[Ellen Churchill Semple]]'s widely-read Influences of Geographic Environment (1911) – so much so that he introduced much of Semple's thinking into his geography course at Indiana University in 1919 (Keighren, 2010). He was particularly interested in the fields of anthropogeography and environmental determinism. He borrowed from these geographical trends to help explain, for example, the historic development of urban areas and the 'geography of notables' (S. Visher, 1928). In addition, the works of ecologist [[Harlan Barrows]] and sociologist George Vincent stirred Visher's interests in social evolution, educational attainment, civic sciences and the spatial nature of intelligence (C. Lavery, 2015).

With Ellsworth Huntington, Visher's attention focused more and more on climatological changes and the effect on life on earth. In ''Climatic Changes, their Nature and Causes'' (1922) the authors claimed that changes in solar activity has had significant effects on earth's climate. They also speculated that this was a chief (or at least important) driver of evolution (J. Fleming, 1998, 105). For instance, they speculated that dynamic solar activity 'may be regarded as the great terrestrial contribution to the climatic environment which guides the development of life' (Huntington and Visher 1922, 240).

As a regional geographer, Visher was concerned about spatial variation. The variability of 'social conditions' or the 'quality of the population' were explained by Visher by invoking environmental explanations (S. Visher, 1931, 757). He suggested, for instance, that the [[climate]], land-use, soil fertility and relief of the land were all factors that needed to be taken into consideration to give a fuller explanation of social and biological differences. Combining this approach with his support of the eugenics movement, Visher set about trying to explain why some areas of the United States have a larger proportion of intelligent people (or 'notables' as he called them) than other areas. As Lavery (2015) has demonstrated, Visher used statistics from ''American Men of Science'' and ''Who's Who in America'' to claim that "the Northern and Eastern states contained disproportionately more 'notables' than any other areas of the country". On this national scale, Visher's explanation of this observation was that the climate of the Northern states is more conducive to intellectual development, while the Southern states suffered from what he called 'an enervating climate' (S. Visher, 1922, 446). On the smaller, regional scale climate played less of an intrusive role. Instead, in his view, the social, political and economic environment went some way to determine intelligence and academic achievement.

==Achievements==
Visher was an active geographer; and, in terms of publications, one of the most productive in the [[United States]] throughout the 1930s and 1940s. His work was recognized nationally and internationally. He was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship at [[Yale]] in 1920; he was elected vice president of the [[American Association of Geographers]] in 1931 and president of the Indiana Academy of Science in 1950; and held visiting professorships at [[Cornell University]], and the Universities of Colorado and British Columbia (C. Lavery, 2015).

A ''''''sustainable''' habitat''' is an [[ecosystem]] that produces food and shelter for people and other organisms, without resource depletion and in such a way that no external waste is produced.  Thus the habitat can continue into future tie without external infusions of resource. Such a sustainable habitat may evolve naturally or be produced under the influence of man.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} A [[sustainability|sustainable]] [[habitat]] that is created and designed by human intelligence will mimic nature, if it is to be successful. Everything within it is connected to a complex array of organisms, physical resources and functions. Organisms from many different [[biome]]s can be brought together to fulfill various ''ecological niches''.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The term often refers to sustainable [[:Category:Human habitats|human habitat]]s, which typically involve some form of [[green building]] or [[environmental planning]].

==Overview==
In creating the sustainable habitats, [[environmental scientist]]s, designers, engineers and [[architecture|architects]] must consider no element as a [[waste]] product to be disposed of somewhere off site, but as a nutrient stream for another process to feed on. Researching ways to interconnect waste streams to production creates a more sustainable society by minimizing [[pollution]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The '''Tian Shan''', ({{zh|c=天山|p=Tiānshān}}, {{lang-dng|Тянсан}}; ''Tjansan''; [[Old Turkic]]: '''𐰴𐰣 𐱅𐰭𐰼𐰃''', ''Tenğri tağ''; {{lang-tr|Tanrı Dağı}}; {{lang-ko|탕그리 토그}}; {{lang-mn|Тэнгэр уул}}, ''Tenger uul''; {{lang-ug|تەڭرىتاغ}}, Тәңри тағ, ''Tengri tagh''; {{lang-ky|Теңир-Тоо/Ала-Тоо}}, ''Teñir-Too/Ala-Too'', تەڭىر-توو/الا-توو; {{lang-kk|Тәңіртауы/Алатау}}, ''{{nowrap|Táńirtaýy/Alataý}}'', تأڭئرتاۋ; {{lang-uz|Tyan-Shan, Tangritog'}}, ''Тян-Шан, Тангритоғ'', تيەن-شەن) also known as the '''Tengri Tagh''', meaning the ''Mountains of [[Tian|Heaven]]'' or the ''Heavenly Mountain'', is a large system of mountain ranges located in [[Central Asia]]. The highest peak in the Tian Shan is [[Jengish Chokusu]], at {{convert|7439|m|ft|0}} high. Its lowest point is the [[Turpan Depression]], which sits at {{Cvt|154|m|}} [[below sea level]].&lt;ref name="readersnatural" /&gt;

The Chinese name for Tian Shan may have been derived from the [[Xiongnu]] word ''Qilian'' ({{zh|s=祁连|t=祁連|p=Qí lián}}) – according to [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] commentator [[Yan Shigu]], ''Qilian'' is the Xiongnu word for sky or heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qo9kCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT985&amp;lpg=PT985#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=漢書: 顏師古註 Hanshu: Yan Shigu Commentary|quote=祁連山即天山也,匈奴呼天為祁連 (translation: Qilian Mountain is the Tian Shan, the Xiongnu called the sky qilian) |author=班固 Ban Gu|date=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sima Qian]] in the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' mentioned ''Qilian'' in relation to the homeland of the [[Yuezhi]], and the term is believed to refer to the Tian Shan rather than the [[Qilian Mountains]] {{convert|1500|km}} further east now known by this name.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Xinru |last=Liu |authorlink=Xinru Liu |title=Migration and Settlement of the Yuezhi-Kushan: Interaction and Interdependence of Nomadic and Sedentary Societies |year=2001 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_world_history/v012/12.2liu.html |journal=Journal of World History |volume=Volume 12 |issue=Issue 2, Fall 2001 |pages=261–291 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mallory, J.

==Geography==
Tian Shan is north and west of the [[Taklamakan Desert]] and directly north of the [[Tarim Basin]] in the border region of [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Xinjiang]] in [[northwest China]]. In the south it links up with the [[Pamir Mountains]] and to north and east it meets the [[Altai Mountains]] of [[Mongolia]].  &lt;!-- would not it be better say that the Pamir is between the Tianshan and the Hindu Kush? --Yes, it would.  Tian Shan nowhere near Pak or Xizang (Tibet); separated from Pak by the Hindu Kush and Pamirs --&gt;

In Western cartography such as [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], the eastern end of the Tian Shan is usually understood to be east of [[Ürümqi]], with the range to the east of that city known as the [[Bogda Shan]] as part of the Tian Shan. Chinese cartography from the [[Han Dynasty]] to the present agrees, with the Tian Shan including the Bogda Shan and [[Barkol]] ranges.
[[File:tien shan sat.jpg|thumb|right|Tian Shan Mountains from space, October 1997, with [[Issyk-Kul Lake]] in Kyrgyzstan at the northern end]]

The Tian Shan are a part of the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] [[Orogeny|orogenic belt]], which was formed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian [[Plate tectonics|plates]] in the [[Cenozoic]] era. They are one of the longest mountain ranges in [[Central Asia]] and stretch some {{convert|2900|km|}} eastward from [[Tashkent]] in [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="readersnatural"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=978-0-89577-087-5|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|pages=378|quote=|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest peak in the Tian Shan is [[Jengish Chokusu]] (also called Victory Peak) on the border of China. At {{convert|7439|m|ft|0}} high, it is the [[Geography of Kyrgyzstan|highest point in Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref name="readersnatural" /&gt; The Tian Shan's second highest peak, [[Khan Tengri]] (Lord of the Spirits), straddles the Kazakhstan-Kyrgyzstan border and at {{convert|7010|m}} is the [[Geography of Kazakhstan|highest point of Kazakhstan]]. [[Mountaineering|Mountaineers]] class these as the two most northerly peaks over {{convert|7000|m}} in the world.

The [[Torugart Pass]], at {{convert|3752|m|ft|0}}, is located at the border between Kyrgyzstan and China's [[Xinjiang]] province. The forested [[Alatau]] ranges, which are at a lower altitude in the northern part of the Tian Shan, are inhabited by pastoral tribes that speak [[Turkic languages]].

The Tian Shan are separated from the [[Tibetan Plateau]] by the [[Taklimakan Desert]] and the [[Tarim Basin]] to the south.

The major rivers rising in the Tian Shan are the [[Syr Darya]], the [[Ili River]] and the [[Tarim River]]. The [[Aksu Canyon]] is a notable feature in the northwestern Tian Shan.

Continuous [[permafrost]] is typically found in the Tian Shan starting at the elevation of about 3,500-3,700 m above the sea level. Discontinuous alpine permafrost usually occurs down to 2,700-3,300 m, but in certain locations, due to the peculiarity of the [[Aspect (geography)|aspect]] and the [[microclimate]], it can be found at elevations as low as 2,000 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Geocryology in Mt.

One of the first Europeans to visit and the first to describe the Tian Shan in detail was the Russian explorer [[Peter Semenov of Tian Shan|Peter Semenov]], who did so in the 1850s.

Glaciers in the Tian Shan Mountains have been rapidly shrinking and have lost 27%, or 5.4 billion tons annually, of its ice mass since 1961 compared to an average of 7% worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/central-asia-mountain-range-has-lost-a-quarter-of-ice-mass-in-50-years-study-says-1439823730|title = Central Asia Mountain Range Has Lost a Quarter of Ice Mass in 50 Years, Study Says|last = Naik|first = Gautam|date = August 17, 2015|work = |access-date = August 18, 2015|via = |newspaper = Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that by 2050 half of the remaining glaciers will have melted.

==Ranges==

The Tian Shan have a number of named ranges which are often mentioned separately (all distances are approximate).
[[Image:Seidenstrasse GMT Ausschnitt Zentralasien.jpg|thumb|Tian Shan with the ancient silk road]]

In China the Tian Shan starts north of [[Kumul City]] (Hami) with the U-shaped Barkol Mountains, from about {{convert|600|to|400|km}} east of [[Ürümqi]].  Then the [[Bogda Shan]] (god mountains) run from {{convert|350|to|40|km}} east of Ürümqi.  Then there is a low area between Ürümqi and the [[Turfan Depression]].  The [[Borohoro Mountains]] start just south of Ürümqi and run west northwest {{convert|450|km}} separating [[Dzungaria]] from the [[Ili River]] basin.  Their north end abuts on the {{convert|200|km}} [[Dzungarian Alatau]] which run east northeast along Sino-Kazakh border. They start {{convert|50|km}} east of [[Taldykorgan]] in Kazakhstan and end at the [[Dzungarian Gate]]. The [[Dzungarian Alatau]] in the north, the [[Borohoro Mountains]] in the middle and the [[Ketmen Range]] in the south make a reversed Z or S, the northeast enclosing part of Dzungaria and the southwest enclosing the upper Ili valley.

[[File:Yssykkoel-lake.jpg|thumb|Snow-capped peaks of Tian Shan seen from an [[Issyk Kul Lake]] beach]]
In [[Kyrgyzstan]] the main line of the Tian Shan continues as [[Narat Range]] from the base of the [[Borohoro]]s west {{convert|570|km}} to the point where China, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan meet.  Here is the highest part of the range – the Central Tian Shan, with [[Peak Pobeda]] ([[Kakshaal Too]] range) and [[Khan Tengri]]. West of this, the Tian Shan split into an ‘eye’, with [[Issyk Kul Lake]] in its center.  The south side of the lake is the [[Terskey Alatau]] and the north side the [[Kyungey Ala-Too]] (shady and sunny Ala-Too).  North of the Kyungey Ala-Too and parallel to it is the  [[Trans-Ili Alatau]] in Kazakhstan just south of [[Almaty]].   West of the eye, the range continues {{convert|400|km}} as the [[Kyrgyz Ala-Too]], separating [[Chui Province]] from [[Naryn Oblast]] and then Kazakhstan from the [[Talas Province]].  This [[oblast]] is the upper valley of the [[Talas River]], the south side of which is the {{convert|200|km}} [[Talas Ala-Too Range]] ('Ala-too' is a Kirgiz spelling of Alatau).   At the east end of the Talas Alatau the [[Suusamyr Too]] range runs southeast enclosing the [[Suusamyr Valley]] or plateau.

As for the area south of the [[Fergana Valley]] there is a {{convert|800|km}} group of mountains that curves west-southwest from south of Issyk Kul Lake separating the [[Tarim Basin]] from the [[Fergana Valley]].  The [[Fergana Range]] runs northeast towards the Talas Ala-Too and separaties the upper Naryn basin from Fergana proper.  The southern side of these mountains merge into the [[Pamirs]] in Tajikistan ([[Alay Mountains]] and [[Trans-Alay Range]]). West of this is the [[Turkestan Range]], which continues almost to Samarkand.

==Ice Age ==
On the north margin of the [[Tarim basin]] between the mountain chain of the [[Kokshaal-Tau]] in the south and that one of the [[Terskey Alatau]] in the north there stretches the 100 to 120&amp;nbsp;km wide Tian Shan plateau with its set up mountain landscape.The Kokshaal-Tau continues with an overall length of 570&amp;nbsp;km from W of Pik Dankowa ([[Dankov]], 5986 m) up to east-north-east to Pik Pobedi ([[Tumor Feng]], 7439 m) and beyond it. This mountain chain as well as that of the 300&amp;nbsp;km long parallel mountain chain of the Terskey Alatau and the Tian Shan plateau situated in between, during glacial times were covered by connected ice-stream-networks and a plateau glacier. Currently the interglacial remnant of this glaciation is formed by the only just 61&amp;nbsp;km long [[South Inylschek]] glacier. The outlet glacier tongues of the plateau glacier flowed to the north as far as down to Lake [[Issyk Kul]] (Lake) at 1605 (1609) m asl calving in this 160&amp;nbsp;km long lake.

In the same way strongly glaciated was the in excess of 50&amp;nbsp;km wide high mountain area of the [[Kungey Alatau]] connected north of Issyk Kul and stretching as far as the mountain foreland near Alma Ata. The Kungey Alatau is 230&amp;nbsp;km long. Down from the Kungey Alatau the glacial glaciers also calved into the Issyk Kul lake.Its Chon-Kemin valley was glaciated up to its inflow into the Chu valley.&lt;ref name="meteorological1994"&gt;Kuhle, M. (1994): ''New Findings on the Ice-cover between Issyk-Kul and K2 (Tian Shan, Karakorum) during the Last Glaciation.''

Extent and Chronology of Glaciations, Vol. 3 (Latin America, Asia, Africa, Australia, Antarctica). Amsterdam, Elsevier B.V., pp. 175-199.&lt;/ref&gt; From the west-elongation of the Kungey Alatau –that is the Kirgizskiy Alatau range (42°25’N/74° - 75°E) - the glacial glaciers flowed down as far as into the mountain foreland down to 900 m asl (close to the town [[Bishkek]]). Among others the [[Ak-Sai]] valley glacier has developed there a mountain foreland glacier.&lt;ref name="meteorological1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhle, M. &amp; Schröder, N. (2000): ''New Investigations and Results on the Maximum Glaciation of the Kirgisen Shan and Tian Shan Plateau between Kokshaal Tau and Terskey Alatau.'' Zech, W. (Ed.). Pamir and Tian Shan. Contribution of the Quaternary History. International Workshop at the University of Bayreuth. Abstracts. Bayreuth, University Bayreuth, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated175"/&gt;

Altogether the glacial Tian Shan glaciation occupied an area of c. 118 000&amp;nbsp;km² .The glacier snowline (ELA) as altitude limit between glacier feeding area and melting zone had decreased about 1200 altitude metres compared with today. 
Under the condition of a comparable precipitation ratio there would result from this a depression of the average annual temperature of 7.2 to 8.4&amp;nbsp;°C for the Würm-ice age (Last Glacial period = MIS 2) compared with today. 
&lt;ref name="meteorological1994"/&gt;

==Ecology==
The Tian Shan holds important forests of Schrenk's Spruce (''[[Picea schrenkiana]]'') at altitudes of over {{convert|2000|m}}; the lower slopes have unique natural forests of wild [[Persian Walnut|walnut]]s and [[apple]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salon.com/2011/10/25/how_the_apple_took_over_the_planet/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
===Chinese religion===
In [[Chinese traditional religion]] and [[Daoism]], Tian Shan is associated to God, ''[[Tian]]'' itself. It is also regarded as the location of the peach tree of [[immortality]] wardened by [[Xiwangmu]], the Queen Mother of the West.

===Tengrism===
In [[Tengrism]], Khan [[Tengri]] is the lord of all spirits and the religion's supreme deity, and it is the name given to the second highest peak of Tian Shan.&lt;ref name="myths"/&gt;

==World Heritage Site==
At the 2013 [[World Heritage Committee|Conference on World Heritage]], the eastern portion of Tian Shan in western China's Xinjiang Region was listed as a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.163.com/13/0621/13/91T6F65N00014JB6.html 新疆天山成功申遗]&lt;/ref&gt; The western portion in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan was then listed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Western Tien-Shan|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1490|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|accessdate=17 July 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wilhelm Fritz Hermann Nicolaisen''' (13 June 1927 &amp;ndash; 15 February 2016) was a [[folklorist]], [[linguist]], [[medievalist]], scholar of [[onomastics]] and [[literature]], educator, and author with specialties in Scottish and American studies.

== Life and career ==
W. F. H. Nicolaisen was born Wilhelm Fritz Hermann Nicolaisen on 13 June 1927, in Halle/Saale, in east-central Germany, near Leipzig. His father was a professor of agriculture. He attended the University of Kiel in Germany from 1948 to 1950 where he studied folklore, language, and literature. In 1950 he attended the King's College, Newcastle upon Tyne, now the University of Newcastle in England. He returned to Germany to study at the University of Tübingen, where he received his Dr. Phil. magna cum laude in comparative linguistics, English, and German in 1955. Among his professors were renowned folklorists [[Kurt Ranke]] and [[Walter Anderson (folklorist)|Walter Anderson]]. Having been awarded a "Scholarship for Advanced Studies in Arts" from the University of Glasgow, he later received Bachelor and Master of Letters degrees (1956, 1970) in Celtic Studies. His dissertation in Germany had been on the river names of the British Isles ("Die morphologisch und semasiologische Struktur der Gewassernamen der britischen Inseln") and in Glasgow, he focused on Scottish river names ("Studies in Scottish Hydronymy"). In 1958, he married May Marshall in Scotland and they had four children: Fiona, Kirsten, Moira, and Birgit.

At universities in Glasgow and Dublin Nicolaisen taught German language and literature and from 1956 to 1969 he worked in the School of Scottish Studies at the University of Edinburgh as head of the Scottish Place-Name Survey. He had research interests in language (particularly place names), in folklore (narrative and balladry), in literature (medieval classics and Scottish poets and novelists), and in cultural history (Scotland, the British Isles, and Scandinavia). In the fall of 1966, Nicolaisen came to [[Ohio State University]] in the United States as visiting professor of English and folklore. In 1967, he returned to the University of Edinburgh, becoming the acting head of its School of Scottish Studies in 1968. The following year, he left for the United States to take the position of associate professor in the English Department at the [[Binghamton University]].

When Nicolaisen arrived at Binghamton he taught in the English Department under the "Specialization in Literature and Folklore," one of four. In this capacity his colleague, Dr. Elizabeth Tucker,provided a modern-ancient twist to the mix; their complementaries created a wild range of Folklore courses. Importantly, Binghamton Folklore led by Nicolaisen and Tucker was a joy and became messianic in its nature for other folklorists in New York State. This was largely accomplished through their efforts as Editors of New York Folklore, the journal of the New York Folklore Society, on location in Binghamton. 
 
By 1981, Nicolaisen had engaged in the State University of New York's decision to develop the field of Folklore at Binghamton, one of four University Centers considered. Both Nicolaisen and Tucker were influential at the state and national levels in Folklore. In 1983, one English major graduated with that specialization, folklorist Kathryn [Kimiecik] Foley, MA. Folklorist Dr. Simon J. Bronner had graduated previously from Binghamton in 1974.

My education from Nicolaisen predates his extraordinary presidential address to the American Folklore Society. Throughout the seventies and eighties Nicolaisen and Tucker were critical in the maintenance of Folklore as both field of study and place for theory. Importantly, The New York Folklore Society flourished and continues to provide active public education of all kinds.

Nicolaisen brought an ancient world of intellectual academia with him when he arrived in New York. His study at the University of Tuebingen provided a rigorous scholarship. Equally important, however, was his cheeriness and sense of wry humor. Folklore courses at Binghamton were extremely popular with non-English majors. He grounded a generation of Bachelor of Arts in intellectual advancement and enjoyment, all in the name of Liberal Arts and Humanities. 
 
Before his arrival at Binghamton, Nicolaisen had already completed his twelve years as the head of The School of Scottish Studies at the University of Edinburgh (1957-1969). Nicolaisen also brought with him extensive experience in Northern European Folklore, both places where universities' histories could be counted in centuries. That richness was added to the fabulous SUNY scholars who were home-grown and gave depth to American, post-secondary public education at Harpur College, Binghamton University.
&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Kimiecik Foley, Class of 83, SUNY Binghamton&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1985 the school honored him with the coveted title of distinguished professor of English and folklore. At the university, he served as director of graduate studies of English and director of the linguistic program. Upon retirement in the 1990s, he moved back to Scotland, where he took a post of honorary professor at the University of Aberdeen and visiting professor at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. He took leadership roles in a number of learned societies including service as president of the American Folklore Society, American Name Society, International Congress of Onomastic Sciences,  The Folklore Society (England), New York Folklore Society, Middle Atlantic Folklife Association. He received the American Folklore Society's lifetime achievement award in 2002. He also was named a fellow of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters and the American Folklore Society. A festschrift in his honor was published as ''Creativity and Tradition in Folklore: New Directions'' edited by [[Simon J. Bronner]] (1992). It includes a bibliography of his publications from 1957 to 1991, and indicative of his transatlantic connections, features scholars from Europe and the United States.

He died on 15 February 2016 at the age of 88 in Aberdeen, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-prof-wilhelm-fritz-hermann-nicolaisen-english-lecturer-1-4034258 Obituary: Prof Wilhelm Fritz Hermann Nicolaisen, English lecturer]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarship ==
Nicolaisen's first publications, beginning in 1957, were on place names. To show their relations in time and space and their cultural connections to the views of ethnic communities through history, he collected narratives attached to them. His work culminated almost twenty years later in ''Scottish Place Names,'' a monumental volume that won the Chicago Folklore Prize for outstanding contribution to folklore studies. His output of over 600 journal articles and essays built on this foundation to move into narrative studies, including research on legend, ballad, folktale, jokes, personal experience narrative, and literature. In his narrative studies, Nicolaisen repeatedly examined the linguistic structures that guide formation into narrative. Overall, he insisted that the materials of tradition were creative rather than static. He defined the relationship between creativity and tradition as basic to the process of folklore; he viewed them in tension, not in contradiction.

"Names and Narratives," the title of his presidential address to the American Folklore Society in 1983, indicate major theoretical questions regarding the processes by which traditional expressions are created and spread. Nicolaisen suggested regarding folkness not in terms of societal status but as an appropriate behavioral response to the stimulus of certain circumstances—a "cultural register rather than a cultural level." As a student of linguistics, Nicolaisen recognized register as a reference to a form of language appropriate to a limited situation. Together with the linguistically derived idea that textual structures and variable situations guide the nature of expression, the act—or art—of storytelling largely informs Nicolaisen's viewpoint. Nicolaisen recognized that narratives breed variation because they are reconstituted in performance, although their integrity as stories is maintained. They are, in his words, "the inevitable and necessary result of social interaction, of the need to narrate oneself and each other in never-ending fictions" (1991: 10).

Nicolaisen was active in linking [[geography]] to the study of [[folklore]] and [[language]], and was one of the founders of the Society for North American Cultural Survey to promote work in the field. Nicolaisen was an advocate for mapping folk culture in America as an applied form of folklore study so as to visualize the ways that people "make regions." Nicolaisen insisted that the geographic approach has a profound implication for folklore studies. This approach suggests folk culture as a whole with registers, isoglosses, and dialects. His goal, he stated in essays such as "Variant, Dialect, and Region" for the journal ''New York Folklore'' with which he was associated for many years, was of achieving a geography of tradition that could lead to a geography of the human mind.
