{{short description|Investigations into fraud Thai government officers and temples}}
[[File:พระวิหาร วัดสระเกศ.jpg|thumb|275px|[[Wat Saket]], Buddhist temple in [[Bangkok]]]]

The '''2017–18 Thai temple fraud investigations''' ({{lang-th|คดีเงินทอนวัด|translit=Kadi nguen thon wat|lit=Case of change of money by temples}}) were a series of investigations by the [[NCPO|Thai junta]] of the alleged abuse of governmental subsidies by government officers and Buddhist temples. The investigations started in 2017, and culminated in the controversial May 2018 arrest of five monks with leading positions in the Thai [[sangha|monastic community]]. The investigations have been described as unprecedented and as a critical blow to the faith of Thai Buddhist devotees. They have been subject to criticism and political speculation. In July 2018, the crisis was cited by the junta to amend laws, with the result that the monastic community could no longer choose their own [[Supreme Sangha Council|leading council members]], but these were to be chosen by the [[King of Thailand|Thai King]], and possibly the ruling [[NCPO]].

== Background ==
In Thailand, [[wat|Thai temples]] ({{lang-th|วัด}}; {{rtgs|''wat''}}) do not receive regular financial support from the government, but can make budget requests from the government for restoration or maintenance of temples, educational activities, or other activities for the "dissemination of Buddhism". This is done through the [[National Office of Buddhism]] (NOB), a government department.&lt;ref name="TNN 2017-06-09" /&gt;

Since 2015, the Counter Corruption Division and the {{ill|State Audit Office|th|สำนักงานการตรวจเงินแผ่นดิน}}, both governmental departments, had been receiving reports about fraud with temple budget committed by government officials. The Counter Corruption Division, which would normally report this to the police, could find little evidence. Furthermore, the NOB gave little information.&lt;ref name="Nation 2017-07-03" /&gt; This changed when, in February 2017, former policeman Pongporn Pramsaneh was appointed head of the NOB by the [[National Council for Peace and Order]] (NCPO).&lt;ref name="Nation 2017-07-03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dubus"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dubus |first1=Arnaud |title=Thai junta hounds senior monks but denies internal graft |url=https://www.ucanews.com/news/thai-junta-hounds-senior-monks-but-denies-internal-graft/82502 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727155437/https://www.ucanews.com/news/thai-junta-hounds-senior-monks-but-denies-internal-graft/82502 |archive-date=27 July 2018 |dead-url=no |accessdate=12 June 2018 |work=[[Union of Catholic Asian News]] |date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First two investigations (August 2017) ==
[[File:Watpailom 02.jpg|thumb|Thai monks walking to receive [[alms#Buddhism|alms]]]]

The case started in August 2017&lt;ref name="Lok Wannee"&gt;{{cite news|title=“สุวพันธุ์”ขอทุกฝ่ายมั่นใจดำเนินคดีเงินทอนวัดยุติธรรม|trans-title=Suwapan asks everyone to be confident that the lawsuits for temple fraud will be handled with justice|url=http://www.lokwannee.com/web2013/?p=304278 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727155937/http://www.lokwannee.com/web2013/?p=304278 |archive-date=27 July 2018 |dead-url=no |accessdate=27 May 2018|work=Lok Wannee|date=19 April 2018|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Phrakhru Baitika Anand Khemanando, abbot of a temple in [[Phetchaburi Province]], complained about NOB civil servants. He had requested a budget of eleven million [[Thai baht|baht]], which was granted, but the government officer involved asked the abbot to return ten million baht to him. Khemanando made his complaint to the Counter Corruption Division and the State Audit Office. The Counter Corruption Division investigated the matter further. The commission investigated ten sites throughout Thailand and searched the houses of high-ranking officers of the NOB. The main focus was the use of budgets from 2012 to 2016 that were meant for restoration and repair of temples.&lt;ref name="TR 2018-05-26"&gt;{{cite news|title=ย้อนรอยคดีเงินทอนวัดสะเทือนวงการสงฆ์|trans-title=Looking back at the temple fraud case that shocked the Saṅgha |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yxy4BwXad0|accessdate=26 May 2018|work=[[Thai Rath]]|date=24 May 2018|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thai PBS"&gt;{{cite news |title=ย้อนรอย ทุจริต 40 วัดดังทั่วไทย |trans-title=Temple fraud in retrospect: 40 temples all over Thailand |url=https://news.thaipbs.or.th/content/272401 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727155943/https://news.thaipbs.or.th/content/272401 |archive-date=27 July 2018 |dead-url=no |accessdate=12 June 2018 |work=[[Thai PBS]] |date=24 May 2018 |language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission stated that 33 temples had requested and received subsidies from the NOB, but ten government officials had asked twelve of these temples to return 75 percent of the obtained funds, illegally.&lt;ref name="TR 2018-05-26" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TNN24 2018-6-3" /&gt; The loss of budget was estimated at 60 million baht.&lt;ref name="TR 2018-05-26" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TNN24 2018-6-3" /&gt; Four civilians and one monk were accused of conspiring with government officials.&lt;ref name="TNN24 2018-6-3" /&gt;

Later, a second investigation was held, in cooperation with another six government departments:&lt;ref name="Nation 2017-07-03"&gt;{{cite news |title=ทุจริต "เงินทอนวัด" สะเทือนวงการสงฆ์ |trans-title=Fraud with changing money shocked the Saṅgha |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZogJklgIOuc |accessdate=10 June 2018 |work=[[Nation TV (Thailand)|Nation TV]] |date=3 July 2017|format=Video|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Phaya Thai Road AMLO IMG 7021.jpg|thumb|The [[Anti-Money Laundering Office (Thailand)|Anti-Money Laundering Office]] helped to investigate fraud in the [[National Office of Buddhism|NOB]].|alt=Tall skyscraper behind elevated highway]]

Inspectors discovered the same pattern in another 23 temples, with one temple losing 31 million baht in this manner.

Criticism of the NOB grew quickly, as its director Pongporn came under attack. He was seen to vilify Buddhist monks. Under pressure of pro-Buddhist organizations such as the Thailand Buddhists Federation, he was temporarily removed from his position in August 2017,&lt;ref name="Reuters 17-08-29"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tanakasempipat|first1=Patpicha|title=Thailand's Buddhism chief removed after pressure from religious groups|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-buddhism/thailands-buddhism-chief-removed-after-pressure-from-religious-groups-idUSKCN1B91FE |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727161237/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-buddhism/thailands-buddhism-chief-removed-after-pressure-from-religious-groups-idUSKCN1B91FE |archive-date=27 July 2018 |dead-url=no |date=29 August 2017|accessdate=27 May 2018|agency=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; only to be re-appointed one month later.&lt;ref name="TR 2018-05-26" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt;

On 18 July 2018, another monk in the second investigation was summoned, accused of illegally transferring government funds to another temple, not his own. This monk had a leading position in Wat Phichaiyat. {{As of|2018|7|19|post=,}} the monk was still at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ออกหมายเรียก "พระราชรัตนมุนี" ฟอกเงินคดีทุจริตเงินทอนวัด &lt;!--title left untranslated per [[WP:CRIME]]--&gt;|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2vEWSzsssQ |accessdate=23 July 2018 |work=[[PPTV (Thailand)|PPTV]]|format=Video|date=18 July 2018 |language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ไร้เงา เจ้าคุณบุญเทียม หลังกองปราบออกหมายเรียก &lt;!--title left untranslated per [[WP:CRIME]]--&gt;|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeGcUQEk63A |accessdate=23 July 2018 |work=[[Channel 8 (Thailand)|Channel 8]]|format=Video|date=19 July 2018 |language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third investigation (January 2018) ==
[[File:ตราสัญลักษณ์ ปปช.jpg|thumb|Logo of the  [[National Anti-Corruption Commission (Thailand)|National Anti-Corruption Commission]]|upright=0.7]]

After his re-appointment, Pongporn started a third investigation of illegal dealings, and reported that another ten temples had had their budget cut off in the same manner as the temples in the second investigation. Pongporn revealed the names of only three temples, however. He further stated that the officers held responsible were the same suspects as before, who worked together in a network. Apart from problems with returning budget, another problem was found concerning eight monks from three temples:&lt;ref name="TR 2018-05-26" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thai PBS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TNN24 2018-6-3" /&gt;

* In some news reports, another four unnamed accused monks are listed.&lt;ref name="TNN24 2018-6-3" /&gt;

These eight monks were accused of using the funds provided for purposes other than initially requested. The government funding was spent on Buddhist projects, but for projects which had already been funded. The funds were not spent on the projects for which the budget was initially requested. In these cases, no money was withheld, though civil servants had withheld money in other, legitimate budget requests from the three temples. As the investigations continued, they were split into two task forces: the NOB continued its internal investigation and the National Anti-Corruption Commission cooperated with the Counter Corruption Division to continue the investigations of parties not part of the NOB.&lt;ref name="Lok Wannee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TR 2018-05-26" /&gt; Pongporn made a press statement saying that a commission would be established in the NOB to deal with the suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=พศ.เตรียมตั้งคกก.ลงโทษวินัย9ขรก.เอี่ยวทุจริตเงินทอนวัด |trans-title=NOB prepares a commission to punish 9 officers involved in temple fraud |url=http://www.lokwannee.com/web2013/?p=293920 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727161247/http://www.lokwannee.com/web2013/?p=293920 |archive-date=27 July 2018 |dead-url=no |accessdate=27 May 2018|work=Lok Wannee|date=10 January 2018|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Misappropriated funds to this point were estimated to be 169 million baht.&lt;ref name="TNN24 2018-6-3" /&gt;

He further added that in the first two investigations, the main fault was the NOB itself, but in the third the fault was with the monks arrested, due to evidence indicating "money laundering". He concluded by insisting that any temple aware of any government officials involved in temple scams should report this to the NOB, and they would investigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ผอ.พศ.แจงทุกปมร้อนวงการสงฆ์ |trans-title=Director NOB makes statement about every hot issue of Saṅgha |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7VOPCUdTpI |accessdate=21 June 2018 |work=[[Thai News Agency]] |publisher=[[MCOT]]|format=Video|date=20 June 2018 |language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="INN"&gt;{{cite news |title=พศ.ยันเอาผิดข้าราชการเอี่ยวเงินทอนวัด |trans-title=NOB director insists to charge government officers implicated in temple fraud |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9keHFzbSMT4 |accessdate=21 June 2018 |work=[[INN (Thailand)]]|format=Video|date=20 June 2018 |language=th |time=3:00 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The federation and several other networks, however, recommended that any temples that had {{em|received any budget}} from the NOB should report this to the local police immediately, and report to the police that they would completely cooperate with any legal action against the NOB and be a witness in such cases.&lt;ref name="INN" /&gt;

== Responses and analysis ==
The arrests have been widely regarded by journalists and news analysts as unprecedented and a critical blow to the faith of Thai Buddhist devotees.&lt;ref name="TR 2018-05-28"&gt;{{cite news|title=ปฏิรูปวงการสงฆ์ครั้งใหญ่ |trans-title=Large reform of Saṅgha |url=https://www.thairath.co.th/content/1292526 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727164649/https://www.thairath.co.th/content/1292526 |archive-date=27 July 2018 |dead-url=no |accessdate=28 May 2018|work=Thai Rath|date=28 May 2018|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Khemthong" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

=== Foreign ===
French political journalist Arnaud Dubus and law scholar Khemthong Tonsakulrungruang wrote that the fraud investigations were symptomatic of problem of mismanagement and corruption within the Saṅgha. Though the problems should be dealt with, the NCPO was unlikely to be able to do this because they themselves had problems of [[Corruption in Thailand|corruption]] and lacked political legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Khemthong"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tonsakulrungruang |first1=Khemthong |title=Purging the Thai Sangha |url=http://www.newmandala.org/ncpos-purge-thai-sangha/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727164656/http://www.newmandala.org/ncpos-purge-thai-sangha/ |archive-date=27 July 2018 |dead-url=no |accessdate=10 June 2018 |work=New Mandala |date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dubus |first1=Arnaud |title=La junte lance une opération transparence pour la communauté monastique bouddhiste |trans-title=The junta launches a transparency operation for the Buddhist monastic community |url=http://eglasie.mepasie.org/asie-du-sud-est/thailande/2018-05-31-la-junte-lance-une-campagne-dassainissement-de-la-communaute-monastique-bouddhiste |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727164701/http://eglasie.mepasie.org/asie-du-sud-est/thailande/2018-05-31-la-junte-lance-une-campagne-dassainissement-de-la-communaute-monastique-bouddhiste |archive-date=27 July 2018 |dead-url=no |accessdate=10 June 2018 |work=[[Eglises d'Asie]] |date=31 May 2018 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that the timing of the investigations and subsequent raids were a clear indication that they were politically motivated, as the junta tried to assert greater control over the Thai Sangha before the next election. Paul Chambers, a lecturer at [[Naresuan University]], claimed the arrests were done to take control of any monks who were not loyal to the [[National Council for Peace and Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/thailands-junta-renews-corruption-crackdown-on-buddhist-monks |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727165730/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/26/thailands-junta-renews-corruption-crackdown-on-buddhist-monks |archive-date=27 July 2018 |dead-url=no |title=Thailand's junta renews corruption crackdown on Buddhist monks|last=Ellis-Petersen|first=Hannah|date=26 June 2018|work=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist Jim Taylor wrote that the arrests were likely politically motivated, arguing that the investigations and subsequent arrests represented the "[[network monarchy|ruling palace regime]]" trying to consolidate traditional, central royalist power by eliminating several non-royalist high-ranking monks and members of the [[Sangha Supreme Council]].&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Jim |title=What's behind the 'purging' of the Thai sangha? |url=http://www.newmandala.org/whats-behind-purging-thai-sangha/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727164706/http://www.newmandala.org/whats-behind-purging-thai-sangha/ |archive-date=27 July 2018 |dead-url=no |accessdate=10 June 2018 |work=New Mandala |date=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor argued that this was done in order to take control of several wealthy temples and ensure that the next [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand|leader of the Thai Saṅgha]] is a royalist, pro-junta monk, pointing to the junta's [[Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen#Appointment withdrawn (2015–17)|previous interference with the position]] in 2017. Taylor also pointed out that the suspects of the investigations were [[innocent until proven guilty]], yet were defrocked before trial and stripped of decades of monastic seniority solely on the basis of unproven accusations.&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt;

Representatives of the Thai monastic community responded to the arrests dumbfounded and saddened. Chao Khun Kasem, head of southern ecclesiastical regions and head of a pro-Buddhist network, accused the Thai junta of lack of transparency.&lt;ref name="Jomquan" /&gt; Chao Khun Kasem, as well as Jaroon Wannakasinanont, leader of several pro-Buddhist networks, stated that the government should deal with its own officials first, and only after that deal with the monks involved,&lt;ref name="TNA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TNN24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TNN24 18-06-01"&gt;{{cite news |title=ตร.พบเบาะแสอดีตพระพรหมเมธีหนีข้ามโขงไปสปป.ลาว |trans-title=Police finds evidence formerly Phra Phrom Methee fled, crossing Mekong into Laos |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uki-IMgRzHI |accessdate=10 June 2018|format=Video|date=1 June 2018 |work=[[TNN24]] |language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the monks were guilty at all.&lt;ref name="TNA" /&gt; He argued that if the allocated budget was not used exactly as requested, but was still used for public rather than personal purposes, it was not a serious fault.&lt;ref name="Perdpom" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jomquan 18-04-25" /&gt; Pisit Lilawachiropas, former member of the State Audit Office of Thailand, and Korn Meedee, chairman of the Thailand Buddhists Federation, said accusations against temples were not clear.

The investigations and subsequent arrests have been described as politically motivated.&lt;ref name="Jomquan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laopetchr|first1=Jomquan|title=ล้างบาง วงการสงฆ์ |trans-title=Elimination of the Saṅgha |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSWI4wZ8aks|accessdate=26 May 2018|work=Thai Rath|format=Video|date=25 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TNN24"&gt;{{cite news|title=ทางออกการแก้ปัญหาคดีเงินทอนวัด |trans-title=Solution for temple fraud case |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRvLMSG5K1g|accessdate=26 May 2018|work=[[TNN24]]|format=Video|date=23 May 2018|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Korn has speculated that the arrest of the three Sangha Council members was a form of political revenge. According to Korn, the three council members had been instrumental in removing Pongporn from his position in August 2017. Moreover, they were understood to have connections with the [[United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship]] that opposed the junta, and were therefore seen as a threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Petpradap|first1=Jom|title="แค้น-การเมือง"เบื้องหลังกำจัด"พระเถระ-มส."กรณีทุจริตทอนเงินวัด |trans-title=Revenge and politics: behind the removal of Sangha Council senior monks, temple fraud case |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igZAmZ4yZYQ|accessdate=27 May 2018|work=Thaivoice|format=Video|date=20 April 2018|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the junta have argued that the high-profile arrests were an attempt to cover up the military government's own failings.&lt;ref name="Dubus" /&gt;

On 25 July 2017, several influential monks, among them Chao Khun Pipit, asked for a {{ill|traditional, monastic boycott|th|การคว่ำบาตร (ศาสนาพุทธ)}} of the NOB, calling upon tens of thousands of Thai administrative monks to suspend communications with them.&lt;ref name="Now26"&gt;{{cite news |title=ปมร้อนเขย่าเงินวัดแสนล้าน "สังฆาธิการ" เปิดศึก "พศ." |trans-title=Hot issue messing up 100.000 M temple's money, abbots start a battle with NOB |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRss0RQEpfI |accessdate=12 June 2018 |work=[[Now26]]|format=Video |date=25 July 2017 |language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led to the temporary suspension of Pongporn's position as director in August 2017. On 1 June 2018, Jaroon, in the name of several pro-Buddhist networks, charged Pongporn with fraud and negligence in official duties,&lt;ref name="TNN24 18-06-01" /&gt; after unsuccessfully petitioning several government departments.&lt;ref name="Bangkok Post"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nathanri |first1=Jakkrapan |last2=Nanuam |first2=Wassana |title=Lines draw in Buddhist battle over temple funds |url=https://www.pressreader.com/thailand/bangkok-post/20180426/281560881401741 |accessdate=12 June 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |via=PressReader.com |date=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pongporn defended his actions in 2017 and again in June 2018, stating that most of the suspects were government officials, but if monks were involved, he had to follow procedures.&lt;ref name="INN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Now26" /&gt; Similarly, Varaiyuth and his colleague Kamol Rianracha stated in their defense that the main targets of the investigations were government officials rather than Thai temples, which, in the words of Varaiyuth, tended to be "the prey of government officers".&lt;ref name="Now26" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=รายงาน ย้อนเส้นทางสืบสวนคดีเงินทอนวัด |trans-title=Report: tracing investigations temple fraud |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi3p7rVsnH8 |accessdate=12 June 2018|format=Video|work=[[New18]] |date=12 June 2018 |language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also people who supported the investigations and arrests, arguing that it helped improve the monastic community.&lt;ref name="TR 2018-05-28" /&gt; Paiboon stated that the arrests were good riddance. He said that budgets were often abused by temples and since leading monks were considered civil servants under the law, they should take responsibility.&lt;ref name="Benar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jomquan 18-04-25" /&gt; [[Wissanu Krea-ngam]], [[Prime Minister of Thailand#Deputy Prime Ministers|Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand]], made a statement that he did not expect [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhism]] to be affected much by the events.&lt;ref name="NBT"&gt;{{cite news|title=รองนายกฯระบุ คดีเงินทอนวัด ไม่กระทบศรัทธาต่อพระพุทธศาสนา |trans-title=Deputy PM states temple fraud case doesn't affect faith in Buddhism |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyoKUmbLfLM|accessdate=27 May 2018|work=[[National Broadcasting Services of Thailand]]|format=Video|date=25 May 2018|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=“ฉัตรชัย” ย้ำจนท.บุกสอบเงินทอนวัดดังยึดกม |trans-title=Chatrchai repeats that officers investigating temple fraud well-known temples is lawful |url=http://www.lokwannee.com/web2013/?p=308062 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180727165552/http://www.lokwannee.com/web2013/?p=308062 |archive-date=27 July 2018 |dead-url=no |accessdate=27 May 2018 |work=Lok Wannee |date=24 May 2018 |language=th |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ariyavongsagatanana (Amborn Ambaro)|Somdet Phra Ariyavongsagatanana]], the [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand|Supreme Patriarch]] of the Thai monastic community, said he was "concerned with the current state of Buddhism", but that he understood that the authorities needed to take action. He further requested that "all organizations properly explain to the public" what was going on.&lt;ref name="BEC 2018-05-26" /&gt;

== Subsequent political reform ==
The fraud investigations have led to some ideas for political reform. Back in 2017, Pongporn stated that the structure of the NOB had been greatly improved on and subsequent fraud was less likely. In particular, more oversight had been built into the budget request procedures. Pongporn also proposed more government control over the finances of Thai temples.&lt;ref name="TNN 2017-06-09"&gt;{{cite news|title=เปิดเส้นทางทุจริต"เงินทอน"งบอุดหนุนวัด |trans-title=Revealing the path of fraud in temple subsidies |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ituCBB4Ocfs|accessdate=27 May 2018|work=[[TNN24]]|format=Video|date=9 June 2017|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a similar note, Paiboon argued that every Thai temple should have an independent lay accountant.&lt;ref name="Benar" /&gt;

Pricha argued that the fraud investigations point to a larger problem, that is, the Sangha Council was responsible for too many matters, without proper organization and independent oversight—the council was responsible for [[legislature|legislative]], [[executive (government)|executive]], and [[judiciary|judicial]] powers, with no [[Separation of powers|division of these functions]].&lt;ref name="TNA" /&gt; Journalist [[Pravit Rojanaphruk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rojanaphruk |first1=Pravit |authorlink1=Pravit Rojanaphruk |title=The Corruption and Excesses of Thai Buddhism |url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/opinion/2018/06/02/the-corruption-and-excesses-of-thai-buddhism/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727170053/http://www.khaosodenglish.com/opinion/2018/06/02/the-corruption-and-excesses-of-thai-buddhism/ |archive-date=27 July 2018 |dead-url=no |accessdate=10 June 2018 |work=Khaosod English|date=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Buddhist scholar Vichak Panich&lt;ref name="Straight" /&gt; argued that the fraud investigations pointed to a larger problem of the Thai [[separation of church and state|state and religion being intermingled]].

On 5 July 2018, the Thai junta amended the Saṅgha Act. An important implication of the amendment was that members of the Sangha Council were chosen by the [[King of Thailand|Thai King]], instead of being chosen by members of the Saṅgha themselves. Proposed by the Thai Cabinet, the amendment was unanimously approved by the [[National Legislative Assembly of Thailand (2014)|National Legislative Assembly of Thailand]], a government department the junta had set up since the 2014 coup. Wissanu Krea-ngam explained that the Saṅgha Council was "too old" and "often ill", which made it difficult to appoint their own members and to deal with the "current crisis". The new members would normally be appointed in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=สนช.เห็นชอบร่างแก้ไขเพิ่มเติม พ.ร.บ.คณะสงฆ์ |trans-title=National Legislative Assembly approves amendment of Saṅgha Act |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJMPaW05MBQ |accessdate=23 July 2018 |work=[[National Broadcasting Services of Thailand]]|format=Video|date=5 July 2018 |language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korn Meedee complained that too little time was given for the Saṅgha to oppose or give their opinion on the amendment and even if they submitted their response in time, the National Legislative Assembly did not respond. After the amendment had been finalized, Korn stated that Buddhist organizations could no longer protest against the new act due to risk of violating the strict law on [[lèse majesté in Thailand]]. He did add, however, that pro-Buddhist networks did not object to the role of the Thai king, but felt it was possible the junta would choose the members instead, citing the king's authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Petpradap |first1=Jom |title=พรรคแผ่นดินธรรม ชูธง ปกป้องพุทธศาสนา ย้ำแก้”กม.สงฆ์”ต้องถามพระและชาวพุทธ |trans-title=Phaendin Tham Party shows a clear stance in protecting Buddhism, affirms that monks and Buddhists should be asked about Saṅgha Act |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8J36PJddp0 |accessdate=23 July 2018 |date=4 July 2018|format=Video|work=Thaivoice |language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Accelerated pluralism''' is a theory coined by Bruce Bimber which claims that "the net is accelerating the process of issue [[Group dynamics#Group formation|group formation]] and [[Group action (sociology)|action]]".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Accelerated pluralism is a method of mobilization used in the formation of [[social movement]]s that is facilitated by the use of [[Information and communications technology|information communication technologies]]. This method of group formation is unique because through the use of the Internet people are able congregate in the [[Public sphere|virtual public sphere]] and decide which form of action to take.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bimber|first=Bruce|date=1998-01-01|title=The Internet and Political Transformation: Populism, Community, and Accelerated Pluralism|jstor=3235370|journal=Polity|volume=31|issue=1|pages=133–160|doi=10.2307/3235370}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Center for Democracy and Technology’s Daniel Weitnzer, the Internet facilitates a “one-to-one interaction…between citizens and government” something that is missing in today's politics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Accelerated pluralism played a major role in the mobilization efforts of the [[Arab Spring]], [[Occupy movement|Occupy]] and [[Black Lives Matter]] social movements by allowing the participants to congregate cheaply and quickly.

'''Acozac''' (Ixtapaluca) is an [[archaeological site]] located in the Municipality of [[Ixtapaluca]], [[State of Mexico]], [[Mexico]]. The site is at kilometer 30 of federal road México - Puebla, towards Ixtapaluca.

== The site==
Has been linked with Tlazallan - Tlallanoztoc, ([[Codex Xolotl]]) as the grandson of Xólotl Techotlallatzin cities site. Ceramic evidence indicates the site had occupation at the following periods: foundation probably started in Azteca I phase (900 to 1,200 CE), and continued with Aztec phase II (1200 to 1430) (Techotlallatzin reign). Azteca phase III (1430 to 1521) structures are currently visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INAH ACOZAC Web Page |trans-title=Acozac Archaeological Site |url=http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za00903.html |work=INAH |publisher=Archaeologist Raúl Ernesto García Chávez |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-09-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910144816/http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/todas/htme/za00903.html |archivedate=10 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techotlallatzin, Texcoco ''[[tlatoani]]'' died in 1406, his son [[Itzcoatl]] took his place, an inexperienced Prince and was surprised at his city, by [[Tezozomoc (Azcapotzalco)|Tezozomoc]], [[Azcapotzalco]] ''tlatoani'', escaped with his son [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]] in arms. He was chased up a forest, where he managed to hide the baby before being killed.&lt;ref name="Arts &amp; History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Señores Mexica|url=http://www.arts-history.mx/sitios/index.php?id_sitio=185352&amp;id_seccion=733172&amp;id_subseccion=765375&amp;id_documento=999|work=Arts &amp; History|publisher=|language=Spanish|accessdate=2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structures ==
Circular temple is dedicated to worship [[Ehecatl]], "the wind god".

The Great Platform (between the circular temple and the Palace), the structure has rooms, patios and altars; some red stucco finishing remains to date; also, two small altars were found near the foundation of the main temple and in front in the lower part.

Over a hundred structures have been detected, presumably for residential use.

From the site the volcanoes [[Popocatepetl]] and [[Iztaccihuatl]] can be seen, the site is in the middle of a forest, and the construction remains can be seen, in addition to the natural landscape.

An '''aul''' ({{lang-ce|oil}}, {{lang-ru|аул}}, [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]: ''awıl'') is a type of fortified village found throughout the [[Caucasus]] mountains.

==Etymology==
The word itself is of Turkic origin and simply means ''village'' in many Turkic languages.

Auyl ({{lang-kk|Ауыл}}) is a Kazakh word meaning "village" in [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Қазақ тілі термиңдерінің салалық ғылыми түсіндірме сөздігі: География және геодезия. — Алматы: "Мектеп" баспасы, 2007. — 264 бет. {{ISBN|9965-36-367-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The auls of [[Svaneti]] (in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]]), with their distinctive medieval towers, have been recognized as a [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/709 "Upper Svaneti - UNESCO World Heritage Centre"], ''UNESCO World Heritage Centre'', United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable towers may be found elsewhere in the Caucasus, specifically in [[Ingushetia]].

The auls are generally built out of stone, on faces of ridges or against cliffs in order to provide protection against surprise attacks. Houses are usually two stories high, and they are staggered to make it virtually impossible for enemies to get anywhere on the roads. The houses usually have a southern aspect to take advantage of the sun in the winter and to be sheltered from the northern winds. Often, they are not located near good farmland or water sources, so it is necessary to bring water into the settlement.

In the 19th century, as [[Russian Empire|Russia]] fought to [[Caucasian War|conquer the Caucasus]], auls were very formidable defences and could be taken for the most part only by storming. There are many famous auls in [[Chechnya]] which the Russians could not reach.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

'''Bangala''' is a [[Bantu language]] spoken in the northeast corner of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[South Sudan]] and the extreme western part of [[Uganda]]. A divergent form of [[Lingala language|Lingala]], it is used as a [[lingua franca]] by people with different languages and rarely as a first language. The estimated number of speakers varies between 2 and 3.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bxg Ethnologue.com: Bangala - A language of the Democratic Republic of Congo]&lt;/ref&gt; It is spoken to the east and northeast of the area where Lingala is spoken. In Lingala, Bangala translates to "People of [[Mongala]]" this means people living along the [[Mongala River]]

==History==
As Lingala spread east and north, its vocabulary was replaced more and more by tribal and regional languages, and it became more of an [[interlanguage]] (a language that is a mix of two or more languages) and was classified as a separate language – Bangala. The vocabulary varies, depending on the first language of the speakers.

Around the 1980s, with the popularity and increased availability of Lingala in modern music, young people in large villages and towns began adopting Lingala so much that their Bangala is becoming more of a dialect than a separate language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bxg Ethnologue.com: Bangala - A language of the Democratic Republic of Congo]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
In Bangala, the words for six and seven (''motoba, sambo'') are replaced with the [[Swahili language|Swahili]] words ''sita'' and ''saba''. Many Lingala words are replaced by words in Swahili, [[Zande language|Zande]], other local languages, plus English (''bilizi'' is derived from the English word bridge) and, of course, French.

The verb "to be" is conjugated differently in Bangala. Below is a comparison with Lingala.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! English !! Lingala !! Bangala
|-
| I am|| nazali || nazi
|-
| you are (singular) || ozali || ozi
|-
| he/she is || azali || azi
|-
| it is || ezali || ezi
|-
| we are || tozali || tozi
|-
| you are (plural) || bozali || bozi
|-
| they are || bazali || bazi
|}
The verb prefix ''ko-'', meaning "to" in Lingala is instead ''ku'', as it is in Swahili, so "to be" in Bangala is ''kusala'', not ''kosala''. Many other Bangala words have an /u/ sound where Lingala has an /o/ sound, such as ''bisu'' (not ''biso'' - "we") and ''mutu'' (not ''moto'' - "person").

'''Carrie Amelia Nation''' (forename sometimes spelled '''Carry''';&lt;ref&gt;1850 United States Federal Census; this census lists the Moore family, and includes then 3-year-old Caroline. Carrie or Carry were nicknames.&lt;/ref&gt; November 25, 1846 – June 9, 1911) was an American woman who was a radical member of the [[temperance movement]], which opposed alcohol before the advent of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]. She is particularly noteworthy for attacking alcohol-serving establishments (most often taverns) with a [[hatchet]].

Nation also had concerns about tight clothing for women. In fact, she refused to wear a corset and urged women not to wear them because of their harmful effects on vital organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kshs.org/p/online-exhibits-carry-a-nation-part-5/10593|title=Carry A. Nation|publisher=Kansas Historical Society|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She described herself as "a bulldog running along at the feet of Jesus, barking at what He doesn't like",&lt;ref name=mcqueen&gt;{{cite book|last=McQueen|first=Keven|others=Ill. by Kyle McQueen|title=Offbeat Kentuckians: Legends to Lunatics|chapter=Carrie Nation: Militant Prohibitionist|year=2001|publisher=McClanahan Publishing House |location=[[Kuttawa, Kentucky]]|isbn=0-913383-80-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed a divine ordination to promote temperance by destroying bars.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The spelling of her first name varies; both "Carrie" and "Carry" are considered correct. Official records say "Carrie", which Nation used for most of her life; the name "Carry" was used by her father in the family Bible. Upon beginning her campaign against liquor in the early 20th century, she adopted the name "Carry A. Nation", saying it meant "Carry A Nation for Prohibition".&lt;ref name="umsystem1911"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://shs.umsystem.edu/historicmissourians/name/n/nation/ | title=Carry A. Nation (1846–1911) | publisher=The State Historical Society of Missouri | accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining notoriety, Carrie officially registered "Carry" as a trademark.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Frontiers: Women Who Shaped the Midwest|last=Johnson|first=Yvonne|publisher=Truman State University Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Kirksville, Missouri|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and first marriage==
Nation was born in [[Garrard County, Kentucky]], to George and Mary (née Campbell) Moore.&lt;ref name="use"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nation|first=Carry|title=The Use and Need of the Life of Carry A. Nation|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/crntn10.txt|format=TXT|accessdate=January 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a successful farmer, stock trader, and slaveholder&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; of Irish descent. During much of her early life, her health was poor and her family experienced financial setbacks.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The family moved several times in Kentucky and finally settled in [[Belton, Missouri]] in 1854.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; She had poor education and informal learning.

In addition to their financial difficulties, many of her family members suffered from mental illness, her mother at times having delusions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewildwest.org/cowboys/wildwestlegendarywomen/205-carrynation|title=Carry Amelia Moore Nation|publisher=The Wild West|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is speculation that the family did not stay in one place long because of rumors about Nation's mother's mental state. Some writers have speculated that Nation's mother, Mary, believed she was Queen Victoria because of her love of finery and social airs. Mary lived in an insane asylum in [[Nevada, Missouri]], from August 1890 until her death on September 28, 1893. Mary was put in the asylum through legal action by her son, Charles, although there is suspicion that Charles instigated the lawsuit because he owed Mary money.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

The family moved to Texas as Missouri became involved in the Civil War in 1862. George did not fare well in Texas, and he moved his family back to Missouri.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The family returned to High Grove Farm in Cass County. When the Union Army ordered them to evacuate their farm, they moved to Kansas City. Carrie nursed wounded soldiers after a raid on [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], Missouri. The family again returned to their farm when the Civil War ended.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In 1865 Carrie met Charles Gloyd, a young physician who had fought for the Union, who was a severe alcoholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rVvBP9ooCgUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Carry A. Nation: Retelling the Life|publisher=Indiana University Press|date=2001|accessdate=April 6, 2014|last=Grace|first=Fran|page=39|isbn=0253108330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gloyd taught school near the Moores' farm while deciding where to establish his medical practice. He eventually settled on [[Holden, Missouri]], and asked Nation to marry him. Nation's parents objected to the union because they believed he was addicted to alcohol, but the marriage proceeded.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; They were married on November 21, 1867, and separated shortly before the birth of their daughter, Charlien, on September 27, 1868. Gloyd died in 1869 of alcoholism.&lt;ref name= umsystem1911/&gt;

Influenced by the death of her husband, Nation developed a passionate activism against alcohol. With the proceeds from selling her inherited land (as well as that of her husband's estate), she built a small house in Holden. She moved there with her mother-in-law and Charlien, and attended the [[University of Central Missouri|Normal Institute]] in [[Warrensburg, Missouri]], earning her teaching certificate in July 1872. She taught at a school in Holden for four years.&lt;ref name= umsystem1911/&gt; She obtained a history degree and studied the influence of Greek philosophers on American politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foner|first1=Eric|title=Give Us Liberty|publisher=Norton|location=New York|page=850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Marriage and "call from God"==
[[File:CarrieNation.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Carrie Nation after her marriage to David Nation on December 30, 1874 (age {{age|1846|11|25|1874|12|30}})]]
In 1874, Carrie married David A. Nation, an attorney, minister, newspaper journalist, and father, 19 years her senior.&lt;ref name="OHS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=McMillen, Margot Ford |author2=Trout, Carlynn|url=http://shs.umsystem.edu/historicmissourians/name/n/nation/index.html|title=Carry A. Nation (1846–1911)|publisher=State Historical Society of Missouri|work=Famous Missourians|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family purchased a 1,700 acre (690 ha) cotton plantation on the [[San Bernard River]] in [[Brazoria County, Texas]]. As neither knew much about farming, the venture was ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="use"/&gt; David Nation moved to Brazoria to practice law. In about 1880, Carrie moved to Columbia to operate the hotel owned by A. R. and Jesse W. Park. Her name is on the Columbia Methodist Church roll. She lived at the hotel with her daughter, Charlien Gloyd, "Mother Gloyd" (Carrie's first mother-in-law), and David's daughter, Lola. Her husband also operated a saddle shop just southwest of this site. The family soon moved to [[Richmond, Texas]] to operate a hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texas-settlement.org/markers/brazoria/32.html|publisher=Texas Settlement Region|title=Carry Nation's Hotel|accessdate=March 23, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512031356/http://www.texas-settlement.org/markers/brazoria/32.html|archivedate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Nation became involved in the [[Jaybird–Woodpecker War]]. As a result, he was forced to move back north to [[Medicine Lodge, Kansas]] in 1889, where he found work preaching at a Christian church and Carrie ran a successful hotel.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
[[File:Texas Historical Marker for the Site of Carry Nation's Hotel in East Columbia, Texas.jpg|thumb|Texas Historical Marker for the site of Carry Nation's hotel in East Columbia, Texas]]
She began her temperance work in Medicine Lodge by starting a local branch of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] and campaigning for the enforcement of Kansas' ban on the sale of liquor. Her methods escalated from simple protests to serenading saloon patrons with hymns accompanied by a hand organ, to greeting bartenders with pointed remarks such as, "Good morning, destroyer of men's souls."&lt;ref name=mcqueen/&gt; She also helped her mother and her daughter who had mental health problems.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Dissatisfied with the results of her efforts, Nation began to pray to God for direction. On June 5, 1900, she felt she received her answer in the form of a heavenly vision. As she described it:&lt;blockquote&gt;The next morning I was awakened by a voice which seemed to me speaking in my heart, these words, "GO TO [[Kiowa, Kansas|KIOWA]]," and my hands were lifted and thrown down and the words, "I'LL STAND BY YOU." The words, "Go to Kiowa," were spoken in a murmuring, musical tone, low and soft, but "I'll stand by you," was very clear, positive and emphatic. I was impressed with a great inspiration, the interpretation was very plain, it was this: "Take something in your hands, and throw at these places in Kiowa and smash them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/exhibits/carry/smashing.htm|title=Carry's Inspiration for Smashing|publisher=Kansas State Historical Society|accessdate=January 13, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222074733/http://www.kshs.org/exhibits/carry/smashing.htm|archivedate=December 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Responding to the revelation, Nation gathered several rocks – "smashers", she called them – and proceeded to Dobson's Saloon on June 7. Announcing "Men, I have come to save you from a drunkard's fate", she began to destroy the saloon's stock with her cache of rocks. After she similarly destroyed two other saloons in Kiowa, a tornado hit eastern Kansas, which she took as divine approval of her actions.&lt;ref name=mcqueen/&gt;

=="Hatchetations"==
Nation continued her destructive ways in Kansas, her fame spreading through her growing arrest record. After she led a raid in [[Wichita, Kansas]], her husband joked that she should use a hatchet next time for maximum damage. Nation replied, "That is the most sensible thing you have said since I married you."&lt;ref name=mcqueen/&gt; The couple divorced in 1901; they had no children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2514# Carrie Amelia Moore Nation (1846–1911)], ''The Encyclopedia of Arkansas History &amp; Culture''; retrieved May 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1902-06 she lived in [[Guthrie, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://obscurity.typepad.com/.a/6a01156e735f12970c0147e10afc89970b-pi Carrie Nation : Crusader Against Alcohol]; retrieved December 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alone or accompanied by hymn-singing women, she would march into a bar and sing and pray while smashing bar fixtures and stock with a hatchet. Her actions often did not include other people, just herself. Between 1900 and 1910, she was arrested some 30 times for "hatchetations", as she came to call them. Nation paid her jail fines from lecture-tour fees and sales of souvenir hatchets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/exhibits/carry/carry4.htm|title=Paying the Bills|publisher=Kansas State Historical Society|accessdate=January 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The souvenirs were provided by a Topeka, Kansas pharmacist.

In April 1901, Nation went to Kansas City, Missouri, a city known for its wide opposition to the temperance movement, and smashed liquor in various bars on 12th Street in downtown Kansas City.&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. Nation Fired in Police Court: Judge McAuley Assesses the Joint-Smasher $500 and Orders Her out of Town", ''The Kansas City World'', April 15, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt; She was arrested, hauled into court and fined $500 ($13,400 in 2011 dollars),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%24500+%281901+dollars%29|title=$500 (1901 dollars)|publisher=Wolfram Alpha|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the judge suspended the fine so long as Nation never returned to Kansas City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/04/16/101188248.pdf|title=Mrs. Nation Barred from Kansas City|date=April 16, 1901|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would be arrested over 32 times—one report is that she was placed in the Washington DC poorhouse for three days for refusing to pay a $35 fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn95047227/1908-02-13/ed-1/seq-2/#date1=1900&amp;index=4&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;sequence=0&amp;words=Carry+Nation&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;date2=1911&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=Carry+A++Nation&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 "The champion"], February 13, 1908 (Image 2), chroniclingamerica.loc.gov; accessed June 7, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Amarillo, Texas, Nation received a strong response, as she was sponsored by the noted surveyor [[W.D. Twichell]], an active Methodist layman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ftw02|title=Willis Day Twichell|publisher=''[[The Handbook of Texas]]''|accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
[[File:Carrie Nation postcard.jpg|thumb|A postcard from around 1910 saying "All Nations are welcome except Carrie"]]
Nation's anti-alcohol activities became widely known, with the slogan "All Nations Welcome But Carrie" becoming a bar-room staple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/exhibits/carry/carry7.htm|title=Carry A. Nation: A National and International Figure |publisher=Kansas State Historical Society|accessdate=August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She published ''The Smasher's Mail'', a biweekly newsletter, and ''The Hatchet'', a newspaper. Later in life she exploited her name by appearing in [[vaudeville]] in the United States&lt;ref name=mcqueen/&gt; and [[music hall]]s in Great Britain. In October 1909, various press outlets reported that Nation claimed to have invented an aeroplane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Carrie Nation claims|last=|first=|date=2 October 1909|work=Topeka State Journal|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nation, a proud woman more given to sermonizing than entertaining, found these venues uninspiring for her proselytizing. One of the number of pre-World War I acts that "failed to click" with foreign audiences, Nation was struck by an egg thrown by an audience member during one 1909 music hall lecture at the [[Canterbury Music Hall|Canterbury Theatre of Varieties]]. Indignantly, "The Anti-Souse Queen" ripped up her contract and returned to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Abel Green and Joe Laurie, Show Biz From Vaude to Video (New York: Henry Holt &amp; Co., 1951), pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking profits elsewhere, she sold photographs of herself, collected lecture fees, and marketed miniature souvenir hatchets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1901/08/19/archives/mrs-nation-at-atlantic-city-she-only-sold-souvenirs-and-took-a-bath.html "MRS. NATION AT ATLANTIC CITY.; She Only Sold Souvenirs and Took a Bath, and People Were Disappointed"], ''New York Times'', August 19, 1901.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspicious that President [[William McKinley]] was a secret drinker, Nation applauded his [[Assassination of William McKinley|1901 assassination]] because drinkers "got what they deserved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zianet.com/maxey/reflx335.htm|title=A Bulldog For Jesus: Reflecting on the Life and Work of Carrie A.

Near the end of her life, Nation moved to [[Eureka Springs, Arkansas]] where she founded the home known as "Hatchet Hall". In poor health, she collapsed during a speech in a Eureka Springs park. She was taken to a hospital in [[Leavenworth, Kansas]],&lt;ref name="OHS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/n/na006.html|title=NATION, CARRY MOORE (1846–1911)|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|accessdate=June 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119145044/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/N/NA006.html|archivedate=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Evergreen Place Hospital and Sanitarium located on 25 acres at Limit Street and South Maple Avenue just outside the city limits of Leavenworth.&lt;ref&gt;A Standard History of Kansas and Kansans, written &amp; compiled by William E.

Nation died there on June 9, 1911. She was buried in an unmarked grave in Belton City Cemetery in [[Belton, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott.

Nation".

Her home in Medicine Lodge, Kansas, the [[Carrie Nation House (Kansas)|Carrie Nation House]], was bought by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union in the 1950s and was declared a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1976. A spring just across the street from Hatchet Hall in Eureka Springs is named after her.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In [[Politics of Mexico|Mexican politics]] and [[labour economics|labor]], a '''''charro''''' or '''''líder charro''''' ("charro leader") is a [[Federal government of the United Mexican States|government]]-appointed [[Trade union|union]] boss. 

== Dynamics ==

Mexico has a long tradition of government control and cooptation of unions and their leaders. Following the [[Mexican Revolution]], the coalition of generals leading the nation under the auspices of the ''jefe máximo'' [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] that eventually became the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) sought to keep the often fractious labor movement under control, and did so by repressing leaders and movements outside the dominant party. Following the "social revolution" of the [[Lázaro Cárdenas|Cárdenas]] years, the government sought to centralize power in the federal government, replacing local union bosses, who had earned the nickname ''pistoleros'' ("gunmen") through their strongarm policies, with college-educated professionals.

Under Cárdenas, the [[Confederation of Mexican Workers]] (CTM), an umbrella of PRI-affiliated unions, became the instrument of PRI domination of labor. But the direct appointment of union bosses was not institutionalized until the administration of [[Miguel Alemán Valdés]], when in the resolution of a dispute within the independent railroad workers' union, the [[President of Mexico|president]] pushed for a contract that allowed management greater control over the union. Following the resolution, Alemán appointed "loyal" leaders to the petroleum workers' and miners' unions.

The appointed leaders were called ''[[charro]]s'' in derision by the members of the newly usurped unions in reference to [[Jesús Díaz de León]], a leader of the railroad workers' union who was known as "''El Charro''" for attending union functions in the elaborate regalia of the charro, Mexico's traditional cowboy. Díaz de León gained control of the union by means of an interior coup supported by the CTM and President Alemán.

In October 1948, he falsely accused his predecessor of misappropriation of union funds to finance his bid for the presidency of the CTM and following the failure of that bid, the establishment of the independent union. The attorney general's investigation led to Díaz de León's ouster from the union presidency, but he was restored by agents of the federal government, who arrested his rival [[Luis Gómez Z.]] Díaz de León proceeded to alter union bylaws to deny voting rights to the [[wikt:rank and file|rank-and-file]]. He also withdrew the union from the independent coalition.

The struggle against ''charrismo'' took on the title of "union democracy", and remains a vital part of the fight for democracy and social justice in Mexico today.

'''''Chinaman''''' is a contentious [[English language]] term that denotes a [[China|Chinese]] man or person, or as a [[Chinese people|Chinese national]], or, in some cases, an indiscriminate term for a person native to geographical [[East Asia]] or of perceived East Asian race.  Although the term has no negative connotations in older dictionaries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=chinaman |title=Chinaman |publisher=Webster Dictionary, 1913 |accessdate=2007-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212025146/http://machaut.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/WEBSTER.sh?WORD=chinaman |archivedate=2007-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler's Dictionary of English Usage, 1956&lt;/ref&gt; and the usage of such parallel compound terms as [[Englishman]], [[Frenchman]] and [[Irishman]]&lt;ref&gt;Englishman has two plurals: (the) English, when speaking of the nation, and Englishmen when speaking of individuals. The same remark applies to: Dutchman, Frenchman, Scotsman, Welshman, and Cornishman. Chinese is now rarely used as a singular, the compound Chinaman taking its place. A manual of English pronunciation and grammar for the use of Dutch students By J. H. A. Günther, p144&lt;/ref&gt; remain unobjectionable,&lt;ref&gt;Oxford American Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''Chinaman'' is noted as offensive by modern dictionaries. Its derogatory connotations evolved from its use in pejorative contexts regarding the Chinese and other Asians. While usage of the term ''Chinaman'' is nowadays strongly discouraged by [[Asian American]] organizations,&lt;ref name=AsianWeek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianweek.com/070998/news.html |title='Seinfeld' Edits Out Anti-Asian Joke |publisher=AsianWeek |date=1998-07-09 |accessdate=2007-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010045849/http://www.asianweek.com/070998/news.html |archivedate=2007-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HaLingPeak&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E2D91F3EF93AA35754C0A96E958260&amp;n=Top%2fNews%2fScience%2fTopics%2fMountains|title=World News Briefs; Alberta's New Name For Peak in Rockies|publisher=The New York Times|date=1998-07-09|accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ChiSun&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JAS/is_5_30/ai_79304994 |title=Chicago Sun Times&amp;nbsp;— discrimination in reporting |publisher=The Chicago Reporter |date=June 2001 |accessdate=2007-03-20 |first=Stephanie |last=Williams |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206101157/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JAS/is_5_30/ai_79304994 |archivedate=2007-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SanFran&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/03/14/MNGMQOKUIS1.DTL|title=Ted Turner apologizes for remarks on Chinese|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2007-03-14|accessdate=2007-03-20 | first=Vanessa | last=Hua}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it has also been used as a self-referential archetype by authors and artists of Asian descent.&lt;ref name="ChickenCoopChinaman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.hmco.com/english/lauter/heath/4e/students/author_pages/contemporary/chin_fr.html|title=Frank Chin|publisher=Houghton Mifflin College Division|accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may have come from literal translation into English of the Chinese term for "Chinese man/person", 中國人 (''Zhōngguó rén'') = "China man/person".

==Historic usage==
The term ''Chinaman'' has been historically used in a variety of ways, including legal documents, literary works, geographic names, and in speech.  Census records in 19th century [[North America]] recorded Chinese men by names such as "[[John Chinaman]]", "Jake Chinaman", or simply as "Chinaman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vpl.ca/ccg/1891_Census.html|title=1891 Census of Canada|publisher=Vancouver Public Library|accessdate=2007-04-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001015402/http://www.vpl.ca/ccg/1891_Census.html|archive-date=2007-10-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chinese American]] historian Emma Woo Louie commented that such names in census schedules were used when census takers could not obtain any information and that they "should not be considered to be racist in intent".  One census taker in [[El Dorado County]] wrote, "I found about 80 Chinese men in Spanish Canion who refused to give me their names or other information."  Louie equated "John Chinaman" to "John Doe" in its usage to refer to a person whose name is not known, and added that other ethnic groups were also identified by generic terms as well, such as ''[[Spaniard]]'' and ''[[Kanakas|Kanaka]]'', which refers to a [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]].&lt;ref name="Louie"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sc1kf_A5AAwC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;source=web&amp;ots=b_0MhT44m0&amp;sig=jLeThXMmqm8h3aKhDwoCH1YAvKY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#v=onepage|title=Chinese American names: Tradition and Transition|author=Emma Woo Louie|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]|year=1998|isbn=0786404183|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a notable 1852 letter to [[Governor of California]] [[John Bigler]] which challenges his proposed immigration policy toward the Chinese, restaurant owner Norman Asing, at the time a leader in [[San Francisco]]'s Chinese community, referred to himself as a "Chinaman".  Addressing the governor, he wrote, "Sir: I am a Chinaman, a republican, and a lover of free institutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6561/|title="We Are Not the Degraded Race You Would Make Us": Norman Asing Challenges Chinese Immigration Restrictions|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=2007-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Chinaman'' was also often used in complimentary contexts, such as "after a very famous Chinaman in old [[Cassiar Country|Cassiar]] [[British Columbia gold rushes|Rush]] days, (who was) known &amp; loved by whites and natives".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcgn-bin/bcg10?name=386 British Columbia Geographical Names Information System, "Ah Clem Creek"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109111227/http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcgn-bin/bcg10?name=386 |date=January 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Chinese in the American West began to encounter discrimination and hostile criticism of their culture and mannerisms, the term would begin to take on negative connotations. The slogan of the [[Workingman's Party]] was "The Chinese Must Go!", coined in the 1870s before ''chinaman'' became a common derogatory term. The term ''[[Chinaman's chance]]'' evolved as the Chinese began to take on dangerous jobs building the railroads or ventured to exploit mine claims abandoned by others, and later found themselves victims of injustice as accused murderers (of Chinese) would be acquitted if the only testimony against them was from other Chinese. Legal documents such as the [[Geary Act]] of 1892, which barred the entry of [[Chinese people]] to the [[United States]], referred to Chinese people both as "Chinese persons" or "Chinamen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanfranciscochinatown.com/history/1892gearyact.html|title=Geary Act of 1892|publisher=SanFranciscoChinatown.com|accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used to refer to [[Japanese people|Japanese]] men, despite the fact that they are not Chinese.  The [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] admiral [[Tōgō Heihachirō]], during his training in [[England]] in the 1870s, was called "Johnny Chinaman" by his British comrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://205.188.238.109/time/magazine/article/0,9171,755891-2,00.html |title=Sea Dog |publisher=TIME |date=1936-02-24 |accessdate=2007-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212000420/http://205.188.238.109/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C755891-2%2C00.html |archivedate=2007-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Civil rights pioneer [[Takuji Yamashita]] took a case to the [[United States Supreme Court]] in 1922 on the issue of the possibility of allowing [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese immigrants]] to own land in the state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].  Washington's attorney general, in his argument, stated that Japanese people could not fit into American society because assimilation was not possible for "the [[Negro]], the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] and the Chinaman."&lt;ref name="Gordon-Reed2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Annette Gordon-Reed|title=Race on Trial: Law and Justice in American History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YBFpSFyFwwC|date=5 September 2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-802866-6|pages=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literary and musical works have used the term as well.  In "Disgraceful Persecution of a Boy", an 1870 essay written by [[Mark Twain]], a sympathetic and often flattering account about the circumstances of Chinese people in 19th-century United States society, the term is used throughout the body of the essay to refer to Chinese people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twainquotes.com/Galaxy/187005e.html|title=Disgraceful Persecution of a Boy|accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over a hundred years later, the term would again be used during the Civil Rights era in the context of racial injustice in literary works. The term was used in the title of Chinese American writer [[Frank Chin]]'s first play, ''[[The Chickencoop Chinaman]]'', written in 1972,&lt;ref name="ChickenCoopChinaman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://college.hmco.com/english/lauter/heath/4e/students/author_pages/contemporary/chin_fr.html|title=Frank Chin|publisher=Houghton Mifflin College Division|accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the translated English title of [[Bo Yang]]'s work of political and cultural criticism ''The Ugly Chinaman and the Crisis of Chinese Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~mszonyi/280/280doc/Bo_Yang.html |title=The Ugly Chinaman |publisher=University of Toronto |accessdate=2007-04-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203113959/http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~mszonyi/280/280doc/Bo_Yang.html |archivedate=2007-02-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In musical works, the term appears in [[Mort Shuman]]'s 1967 translation of the [[Jacques Brel]] song "Jacky":  "Locked up inside my opium den / Surrounded by some Chinamen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excerpts |publisher=therhymesofgoodbye.com |url=http://therhymesofgoodbye.com/jackie.htm |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317141108/http://www.therhymesofgoodbye.com/jackie.htm |archivedate=2007-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/almond_marc/176257/lyrics.jhtml |title=LYRICS FOR "Jacky (Single Mix)" |publisher=MTV |accessdate=2008-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115024255/http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/almond_marc/176257/lyrics.jhtml |archivedate=January 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The phrase used in Brel's original French lyric was ''vieux Chinois'', meaning "old Chinese".)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paroles.net/chanson/12571.1 |title=La chanson de Jacky |publisher=Paroles.net |accessdate=2008-02-11 |language=French |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709040259/http://www.paroles.net/chanson/12571.1 |archivedate=2008-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was also used in the hit 1974 song  ''[[Kung Fu Fighting]]'', by [[Carl Douglas]]; the song's first verse begins "They were funky Chinamen from funky [[Chinatown]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themadmusicarchive.com/song_details.aspx?SongID=6011 |title=Kung Fu Fighting |publisher=The Mad Music Archive |accessdate=2007-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006160913/http://www.themadmusicarchive.com/song_details.aspx?SongID=6011 |archivedate=2007-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
The term ''Chinaman'' is described as being offensive in most modern dictionaries and studies of usage.&lt;ref name="MW1994"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Chinaman | encyclopedia = Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage | publisher = Merriam-Webster | location = Springfield, Mass. | year = 1994 | isbn = 0877791325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not, however, as offensive as ''[[chink]]''.&lt;ref name="Cambridge2004"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Peters | first = Pam | title = Chinaman or Chinese | encyclopedia = The Cambridge Guide to English Usage | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 2004 | isbn = 052162181X }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New Fowler's Modern English Usage'' considers ''Chinaman'' to have a "derogatory edge",&lt;ref name="Fowler1996"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last1 = Fowler | first1 = Henry | last2 = Burchfield | first2 = R. W. | title = Chinaman | encyclopedia = The New Fowler's Modern English Usage | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1996 | isbn = 0198691262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage'' describes it as having "derogatory overtones",&lt;ref name="Cambridge2004" /&gt; and Philip Herbst's reference work ''The Color of Words'' notes that it may be "taken as patronizing".&lt;ref name="Herbst1997"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Herbst | first = Philip | title = Chinaman | encyclopedia = The Color of Words: An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States | publisher = Intercultural Press | location = Yarmouth | year = 1997 | page = 48 | isbn = 1877864420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinguishes it from similar ethnic names such as ''Englishman'' and ''Irishman'', which are not used pejoratively.&lt;ref name="Herbst1997" /&gt;

In its original sense, ''Chinaman'' is almost entirely absent from British English, and has been since before 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last1 = Fowler | first1 = Henry | last2 = Burchfield | first2 = R. W. | title = Chinaman | encyclopedia = The New Fowler's Modern English Usage | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1996 | isbn = 0198691262 }} Fowler and Burchfield derive the date of 1965 from {{cite book | last1 = Fowler | first1 = Henry | last2 = Gowers | first2 = Ernest | title = Dictionary of Modern English Usage | edition = 2nd | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 1965 | isbn = 9780191964121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, ''chinaman'' (not capitalized) is still used in an alternative sense to describe a [[left-arm unorthodox spin]] [[Bowling (cricket)|bowler]] in [[cricket]].&lt;ref name="Fowler1996" /&gt; Most British dictionaries see the term ''Chinaman'' as old-fashioned, and this view is backed up by data from the [[British National Corpus]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge2004" /&gt; According to ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'', in American English ''Chinaman'' is most often used in a "knowing" way, either satirically or to evoke the word's historical connotations. It acknowledges, however, that there is still some usage that is completely innocent.&lt;ref name="MW1994" /&gt; In addition, Herbst notes in ''The Color of Words'' that despite ''Chinaman'''s negative connotations, its use is not usually intended as malicious.&lt;ref name="Herbst1997" /&gt;

In Chinese language, the term "Chinese" can be seen as corresponding to "chinaman" (中國人), being composed of "China" (中國) and "person" (人). However, this is a forced and ad-hoc analysis. It would be incorrect to say that the Chinese language use "chinaman" to mean "Chinese". Rather, the Chinese term direct translates to "Chinese person", because in Chinese language the adjective "Chinese" and the noun "China" have the same form (中國). It would require a deliberate disregard of semantics and grammar in both languages to force making this correspondence.

==Controversy==
The use of the term ''Chinaman'' in public platforms and as names of geographical locations has been the occasion of several public controversies in recent times.

On April 9, 1998, television [[sitcom]] show ''[[Seinfeld]]'' aired an [[The Bookstore|episode]] in which a character referred to [[opium]] as "the Chinaman's nightcap". The episode prompted many Asian American viewers, including author [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], to send letters of protest. In her letter, Kingston wrote that the term is "equivalent to [[nigger]]s for [[Black people|blacks]] and [[kike]]s for [[Jew]]s". Media watchdog Media Action Network for Asian Americans (MANAA) called on [[NBC]], broadcasting network for the show, to issue a public apology. NBC did not issue an apology, but it removed the offending term from the episode in the episode's rerun in May 1998. NBC's executive vice president for broadcast standards and content policy sent MANAA a letter stating that the network never intended to offend. MANAA was pleased with the studio's response despite the lack of an apology, and Kingston, while disappointed there was no apology, was pleased that the term was removed from the episode.&lt;ref name=AsianWeek /&gt;{{Dead link|date=June 2014}}

On July 7, 1998, [[Canada]]'s [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Alberta]] renamed a peak in the [[Rocky Mountains]] from "Chinaman's Peak" to "[[Ha Ling Peak]]" due to pressure from the province's large Chinese community.  The new name was chosen in honour of the railroad labourer who scaled the peak's {{convert|2408|m|adj=on}}-high summit in 1896 to win a $50 bet to commemorate all his fellow Chinese railway labourers.  Ha Ling himself had named it "Chinaman's Peak" on behalf of all his fellow Chinese railway workers.&lt;ref name=HaLingPeak /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bivouac.com/MtnPg.asp?MtnId=1555|title=Ha Ling Peak (Chinamans Peak) Alberta|publisher=Bivouac.com|accessdate=2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' was chastised by William Yashino, Midwest director of the [[Japanese American Citizens League]], for using the term ''Chinaman'' in two of its columns.  Yashino wrote, in a letter to the editor on May 16, 2001, that the term is derogatory and demeaning to Chinese Americans and Asian Americans, and that it marginalizes these communities and inflames public sentiment.&lt;ref name=ChiSun /&gt;

In March 2007, media mogul [[Ted Turner]] used the term in a public speech before the [[Bay Area Council]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]].  Community leaders and officials objected to his use of the term, and immediately called for an apology.  In a statement released by his spokesman on March 13, 2007, Turner apologized for having used the term, stating that he was unaware that the term was derogatory.  Vincent Pan, director of the organization [[Chinese for Affirmative Action]], said it was "a bit suspect" for someone involved in domestic and world politics like Turner to be unaware that the term is derogatory.  Yvonne Lee, a former commissioner of the [[U.S. Civil Rights Commission]], said the apology was the first step, but wanted Turner to agree to further "dialogue between different communities".&lt;ref name=SanFran /&gt;

On April 11, 2008, golf announcer [[Bobby Clampett]] apologized for referring to golfer [[Liang Wen-Chong]] as "the Chinaman" during the [[Masters Tournament|Masters]] golf tournament at [[Augusta National Golf Club]]. Clampett, working the Internet broadcast of [[Amen Corner (golf)|Amen Corner]], made the comment after Liang missed the cut. According to the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', Clampett was taken off the broadcast after the comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/masters08/news/story?id=3346698|title=Clampett apologizes for description of China's Liang|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2008-04-14|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DAAT.jpg|thumb|''Ching Chong Chinaman'' production photo]]
In 2010, the [[Pan Asian Repertory Theatre]] released a statement explaining their decision to produce a play by Lauren Yee titled ''Ching Chong Chinaman'', a term which has at times been used in  doggerel verse with racist overtones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ching chong chinaman, chin chin chinaman|url=http://www.odps.org/glossword/index.php?a=term&amp;d=3&amp;t=291|work=Seedy Songs and Rotten Rhymes&amp;nbsp;— the poetry of the playground.|accessdate=19 June 2011|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artistic Producing Director Tisa Chang explained that "''Ching Chong Chinaman'' takes its controversial title from the late 19th century pejorative jingle and uses irony and satire to reverse prejudicial attitudes towards Asians and other outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chang|first=Tisa|title=Ching Chong Chinaman|url=http://www.panasianrep.org/ching_chong_chinaman.shtml|publisher=Pan Asian Repertory Theatre|year=2010|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5998">[[File:Coptic flat.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Simple Coptic binding (model)]]

'''Coptic binding''' or '''Coptic sewing''' comprises methods of [[bookbinding]] employed by early Christians in Egypt, the [[Copts]], and used from as early as the 2nd century AD to the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Eric G. |title=The Typology of the Early Codex |publisher=[[University Of Pennsylvania|University of Pennsylvania Press]] |date=1977 |pages=89–94 |isbn=0-8122-7696-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is sometimes claimed that the Coptic binding, and thus the western codex, originated in the 4th century AD. While codex binding did flourish in the 4th century, several extant codex fragments are dated to the 2nd century, and more than 250 exist from before the year 300.  (See Turner, chapter 7, and Szirmai, chapter 2.)&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to describe modern bindings sewn in the same style.

Coptic bindings, the first true [[Codex|codices]], are characterized by one or more [[Section (bookbinding)|sections]] of parchment, papyrus, or paper sewn through their folds, and (if more than one section) attached to each other with chain stitch linkings across the spine, rather than to the thongs or cords running across the spine that characterise European bindings from the 8th century onwards.  In practice, the phrase "Coptic binding" usually refers to multi-section bindings,  while single-section Coptic codices are often referred to as "[[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi]] bindings", after the 13 codices found in 1945 which exemplify the form.

== Nag Hammadi bindings ==
Nag Hammadi bindings were constructed with a textblock of [[papyrus]] sheets, assembled into a single section and trimmed along the fore edge after folding to prevent the inner sheets from extending outward beyond the outer sheets.  Because the inner sheets were narrower than the outer sheets after trimming, the width of text varied through the textblock, and it is likely that the papyrus was not written on until ''after'' it was bound; this, in turn, would have made it a necessity to calculate the number of sheets needed for a manuscript before it was written and bound.&lt;ref&gt;Szirmai, 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner points out that a scribe ''could'', however, insert a single leaf either in the middle of the book or at the end; some evidence points to this having been done in two of the Nag Hammadi codices.&lt;/ref&gt;  Covers of Nag Hammadi bindings were limp leather, stiffened with waste sheets of papyrus.  The textblocks were sewn with tackets, with leather stays along the inside fold as reinforcement.  These tackets also secured the textblock to the covers; on some of the Nag Hammadi bindings, the tackets extended to the outside of the covering leather, while on others the tackets were attached to a strip of leather which served as a spine liner, and which was in turn pasted to the covers.&lt;ref&gt;Szirmai, 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  A flap, either triangular or rectangular, extended from the front cover of the book, and was wrapped around the fore edge of the book when closed.  Attached to the flap was a long leather thong which was wrapped around the book two or three times, and which served as a clasp to keep the book securely shut.&lt;ref&gt;Szirmai, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenfield |first=Jane |title=ABC of Bookbinding |year=2002 |publisher=Oak Knoll Press |location=New Castle, DE |isbn=1-884718-41-8 |pages=80–81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multi-section Coptic bindings ==
[[Image:Coptic sewing.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Detail of Coptic-style sewing (model)]]
Multi-section Coptic bindings had cover boards that were initially composed of layers of papyrus, though by the 4th century, wooden boards were also frequent.  Leather covering was also common by the 4th century, and all subsequent Western decorated leather bindings descend from Coptic bindings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Etherington |first=Donald |title=Bookbinding and the Conservation of Books |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |date=1982 |pages=65 |isbn=0-8444-0366-0 |url=http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/don/dt/dt0830.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 120 original and complete Coptic bindings survive in the collections of museums and libraries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Geoffrey Glaister|Glaister]] |first=[[Geoffrey Glaister|Geoffrey Ashall]] |title=Encyclopedia of the Book |publisher=Oak Knoll Press &amp; [[British Library|The British Library]] |date=1996 |pages=113–114 |isbn=1-884718-14-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the remnants of as many as 500 Coptic bindings survive.&lt;ref name=Szirmai&gt;{{cite book |last=Szirmai |first=J. A. |title=The Archaeology of Medieval Bookbinding |publisher=Ashgate |location=Brookfield, VT |date=1999 |isbn=0-85967-904-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glaister does not give the methodology of his figure, and given its low count, it probably refers only to intact bindings; Szirmai's count includes fragments or sheets which show evidence of being bound, such as sewing holes or codex pagination.&lt;/ref&gt;

The few surviving very early European bindings to survive use the Coptic sewing technique, notably the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] in the [[British Library]] (c. 698) and the Cadmug Gospels at [[Fulda]] (c. 750)

== Modern Coptic bindings ==
Modern Coptic bindings can be made with or without covering leather; if left uncovered, a Coptic binding is able to open 360°. If the leather is omitted, a Coptic binding is ''non-adhesive'', and does not require any glue in its construction.

Artisans and crafters often use coptic binding when creating hand made art journals or other books.

Noble was born in New York City.

==Career==

Noble obtained an undergraduate degree in history and chemistry from the [[University of Florida]] and a doctorate from the [[University of Rochester]].&lt;ref name="mazur"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suzanmazur.com/?p=187 |title=David Noble: Peer Review, Where Are The Scholars? |publisher=suzanmazur.com |date= February 26, 2010 |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a biochemist at various institutions before becoming an assistant professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Dismissed after being denied tenure in 1984,&lt;ref name="suitNYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE7DF1130F933A2575AC0A960948260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fM%2fMassachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology |title=Professor Sues M.I.T. Over Refusal of Tenure |publisher=New York Times |date= September 9, 1986 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; he landed at [[York University]]. Between 1986 and 1994, Noble taught in the Department of History and Politics at [[Drexel University]]. In 1997 he served as the inaugural Hixon-Riggs Visiting Professor of science, technology, and society at [[Harvey Mudd College]].&lt;ref name="hixonRiggsList"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmc.edu/academicsclinicresearch/interdisciplinarycenters/hixonforum1/visitingprofessorship.html |title=The Hixon-Riggs Visiting Professorship |publisher=Harvey Mudd College |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121211114723/http://www.hmc.edu/academicsclinicresearch/interdisciplinarycenters/hixonforum1/visitingprofessorship.html |archivedate=2012-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noble taught at York University until his death.&lt;ref name="GlobeAndMailObit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aulakh, Raveena [https://www.thestar.com/news/article/913434--david-noble-activist-and-academic-gadfly-dies-at-65 "David Noble, activist and academic gadfly, dies at 65"], ''The Toronto Star'', December 29, 2010, accessed December 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogy==

During his entire teaching career Noble refused to grade students, based on the [[critical pedagogy]] of the harm caused by grading.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, David F., "[https://archive.org/details/2007NobleOurScoolsGivingUpTheGrade Giving Up the Grade]", ''Our Schools / Our Selves'', Vol. 16, No. 3 (#87), Spring 2007, Pages 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Written work==

===''America by Design''===
Noble’s first book, ''America by Design: Science, Technology, and the Rise of Corporate Capitalism'' (1977), a revision of his University of Rochester dissertation under [[Christopher Lasch]], was published to unusually prominent reviews.  [[Robert Heilbroner]] hailed it as a work that "makes us see technology as a force that shapes management in an industrial capitalist society," while ''The New York Times'' called the book a "significant contribution" owing to its uncommon leftist perspective on American technology.  Many academic reviewers praised the book's bold argument about the corporate control of science and technology, although some including [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred Chandler]] expressed reservations about its forthright Marxist thesis.&lt;ref name="memorial" /&gt;

===''Forces of Production''===
In ''Forces of Production: A Social History of Industrial Automation'' (1984, 1st edition; 2011, 2nd edition) Noble recounts the history of [[machine tool]] automation in the United States. He argues that [[numerical control|CNC]] (computerized numerical control) machines were introduced both to increase efficiency and to discipline unions which were stronger in the USA in the period immediately following [[World War II]]. ''Forces of Production'' argues that management wanted to take the programming of machine tools, which as "machines for making machines" are a critical industrial product, out of the hands of union members and transfer their control, by means of primitive programming, to non-union, college-educated white-collar employees working physically separate from the shop floor. Noble's research argues that, in practical terms, the separation was a failure.  The practice angered and alienated union machinists, who felt that their practical and night-school knowledge of applied science was being disregarded.  In response, they sat back while watching the programmed machines produce what Noble described as "scrap at high speed." Noble then went on to argue that management compromised with the unions, in a minor violation of the USA's 1948 [[Taft–Hartley Act]] (which reserved all issues except pay and benefits to management discretion), to allow the union men to "patch" and even write the CNC programs. Although Noble focuses strictly, in ''Forces of Production'', on the narrow and specialist area of machine tools, his work may be generalized to issues in MIS software where the end users are restive when told to accept the product of analysts ignorant of the real needs of the business or the employee. David also wrote the Introduction to the second edition of [[Mike Cooley (engineer) | Mike Cooley's]] Architect or Bee? published in the USA in 1982 by South End Press.

===Last writing===
Pursuing his critique of the role of the university, since 2004 Noble was active in bringing attention to what he identified as issues of social justice. These included the notion of the increasing corporatization of the Canadian public university, and defending the idea of [[academic freedom]] and the role of the [[tenure]]d academic as public servant. Noble's most recent book, ''Beyond the Promised Land: The Movement and the Myth'', is a sweeping historiography of what he described as the myth of the promised land, connecting the disappointments of the Christian religious story of redemption and salvation with the rise of global capitalism and the response of these disappointments by recent social justice movements.

==Political activism==
In 1983 David Noble co-founded the National Coalition for Universities in the Public Interest with [[Ralph Nader]] and [[Leonard Minsky]] to try "to bring extra-academic pressure to bear upon university administrations who were selling out their colleagues and the public in the pursuit of corporate partnerships."

Noble's leftist politics and supposedly aggressive tactics gave him a rocky career. He was denied tenure at MIT, forced to leave his appointment at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and blocked from giving the commencement address at [[Harvey Mudd College]] because the administration argued he was "anti-technology." His appointment to the J.S. Woodsworth Chair in the Humanities at [[Simon Fraser University]] was suspended following what Noble and others saw as irregularities in the hiring process.&lt;ref name="Chronicle"&gt;http://chronicle.com/article/David-Noble-Says-His/7499&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, he was awarded the Joe A. Callaway Award for Civic Courage, which "recognizes individuals who take a public stance to advance truth and justice, at some personal risk." The award honored Noble's decades as "a singular voice in seeking to fight the commercialization of higher education and to protect one of society's most precious assets, an independent intellectual capacity to engage the serious issues of our day."&lt;ref name="of David Noble"/&gt;

===Corporatization and commercialization===
In the 1990s, Noble criticized the way in which "second-tier" universities accessible to the majority have been forced, owing to budget pressures absent at well-endowed "first-tier" universities, to adopt overly corporate-friendly policies. According to Noble, these policies subordinate the educational mission to a more careerist vision in which students were taught "practical" subjects, but in such narrow ways that they are, in effect, less broadly employable. In his 1998 paper [http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue3_1/noble/ Digital Diploma Mills], Noble wrote: "universities are not only undergoing a technological transformation. Beneath that change, and camouflaged by it, lies another: the commercialization of higher education". Noble argued that high technology, at these universities, is often used not to improve teaching and research, but to over-control and overwork junior faculty and graduate students, expropriate the intellectual property of leading faculty, and, through various mechanisms such as the recorded lecture, replace the visions and voices of less-prestigious faculty with the second-hand and reified product of academic "superstars".

===Tail that Wags the Dog===
In his broad-based critique of what he viewed as an academic-industrial system, Noble questioned [[Israel]]'s strategic role in Western institutions on a broad basis. In late November 2004, at [[York University]], Noble garnered controversy for handing out [https://lists.resist.ca/pipermail/project-x/2004-December/008361.html flyers] entitled "The York University Foundation: The Tail That Wags the Dog (Suggestions for Further Research)" at a campus event. The information sheets alleged that the Foundation, York University's principal fund-raising body, was biased by the presence and influence of pro-Israel lobbyists, activists and persons involved in Jewish agencies, whom he identified as the "tail", and that this bias affected the political conduct of York's administration in important ways, through their power to "wag the dog". In particular, Noble (who was of Jewish descent himself) claimed that there was a connection between alleged "Pro-Israeli influence" on the York Foundation and the university administration's treatment of vocal pro-Palestinian campaigners on campus and to a later-scuttled project to build a [[Toronto Argonauts]] football stadium on the campus.&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20041120/YORK20/TPNational/TopStories |accessdate=November 1, 2005 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later launched a $25-million [https://web.archive.org/web/20071220203018/http://indaily.net/?p=2652 libel suit]  at the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]] against a series of individuals and of York University, Jewish, and Israeli organizations for defamation and conspiracy, accusing them of having improperly criticized his "Tail That Wags the Dog" campaign as antisemitic.

===Jewish holidays===
Noble and York University also were in the news in October 2005 with regard to his vocal opposition to the university's policy, adopted in 1974, of cancelling classes during the three days marking the [[Jewish]] [[High Holidays]].&lt;ref name="Excal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://excal.on.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=849&amp;Itemid=2 |title=Excalibur Publications &amp;#124; York University's Community Newspaper |publisher=Excal.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noble originally stated he would defy the policy and hold classes nonetheless, however, in the end he pledged instead to cancel his classes on ''all'' religious holidays observed by ''any'' student in his classes, including for example,  all Muslim holidays.&lt;ref name="InsideTO"&gt;[http://www.insidetoronto.ca/to/northy/story/3086823p-3580325c.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006 Noble lodged a complaint with the [[Ontario Human Rights Commission]], alleging that cancellation of classes during certain Jewish holidays constituted discrimination against non-Jewish students. When York independently changed its policy the discrimination matter was withdrawn. In his complaint, Noble also alleged that York engaged in a campaign of reprisal against him. The Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario found no reprisal and dismissed Noble's complaint in its entirety.&lt;ref name="thestar"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/800075--complaint-against-york-is-dismissed |title=Complaint against York is dismissed |publisher=thestar.com |date=2010-04-23 |accessdate=2010-12-30 |location=Toronto |first=Louise |last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===York Public Access===
In his final years at York, Noble was involved in creating an organization called York Public Access as an alternative to what he identified as an increased corporate slant in the approach taken by York University's official media relations department.

[[File:Kalighat Painting Calcutta 19th Century - Woman Strinking Man With Broom.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kalighat painting]]; "Woman Striking Man With Broom" (1875)]]
'''Domestic violence against men''' deals with [[domestic violence]] experienced by [[Man|men]] or [[boy]]s in a domestic setting, such as in [[marriage]] or [[cohabitation]]. As with [[Violence against women|domestic violence against women]], violence against men may constitute a [[crime]], but laws vary between jurisdictions.

Men who report domestic violence can face [[social stigma]] regarding their perceived lack of [[machismo]] and other denigrations of their [[masculinity]].&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lupri |first1=Eugene |last2=Grandin |first2=Elaine |title=Intimate partner abuse against men |year=2004 |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ncfv-cnivf/familyviolence/pdfs/Intimate_Partner.pdf|publisher=National Clearinghouse on Family Violence |accessdate=2014-06-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104074211/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ncfv-cnivf/familyviolence/pdfs/Intimate_Partner.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="Marginalizing"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Marginalizing the Battered Male |journal=[[The Journal of Men's Studies]] |last=Migliaccio |first=Todd A. |volume=9 |issue=2 |date=Winter 2001 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.3149/jms.0902.205}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV) against men is generally less recognized by society than IPV against women, which can act as a further block to men reporting their situation.&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="Framework"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das Dasgupta |first1=Shamita |authorlink=Shamita Das Dasgupta |title=A Framework for Understanding Women's Use of Nonlethal Violence in Intimate Heterosexual Relationships |date=November 2002 |journal=[[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=1364–1389 |doi=10.1177/107780102237408}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative prevalence of IPV against men to that of women is highly disputed between different studies, with some countries having no data at all. Some researchers believe the actual number of male victims may be greater than law enforcement statistics suggest due to the number of men who do not report their abuse.&lt;ref name="Crime Council"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.crimecouncil.gov.ie/downloads/Abuse_Report_NCC.pdf |title=Domestic Abuse of Women and Men in Ireland: Report on the National Study of Domestic Abuse |last1=Watson |first1=Dorothy |last2=Parsons |first2=Sara |publisher=National Crime Council of Ireland |location=Dublin |date=2005 |page=169 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for both men and women, domestic violence is among the most underreported crimes worldwide.&lt;ref name="Cengage Learning"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Strong |first1=Bryan |last2=DeVault |first2=Christine |last3=Cohen |first3=Theodore |title=The Marriage and Family Experience: Intimate Relationships in a Changing Society |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=February 16, 2010 |page=447 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjvoSOMB5JMC&amp;pg=PA447 |isbn=978-1133597469 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110213408/https://books.google.com/books?id=qjvoSOMB5JMC&amp;pg=PA447 |archivedate=2017-01-10 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=concannon&gt;{{cite book |last=Concannon |first=Diana |title=Kidnapping: An Investigator’s Guide |publisher=Newnes |date=July 11, 2013 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KdueQed_sgC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0123740311 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110194423/https://books.google.com/books?id=-KdueQed_sgC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2017-01-10 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPV against men is a controversial area of research, with terms such as ''gender symmetry'', ''battered husband syndrome'' and ''bidirectional IPV'' provoking a great deal of debate. The lines of the debate tend to fall between two basic [[polemic]]s. The first of these argues that scholars who focus on female-perpetrated IPV are part of an [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] backlash, and are attempting to undermine the problem of male-perpetrated abuse by championing the cause of the man, over the much more serious cause of the abused woman.&lt;ref name="Kersti"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yllö |first=Kersti |chapter=Political and Methodological Debates in Wife Abuse Research |title=Feminist Perspectives on Wife Abuse |year=1988 |editor1-last=Yllö |editor1-first=Kersti |editor2-last=Bogard |editor2-first=Michele |pages=40–47 |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, CA. |isbn=9780803930537}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Worcester"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Worcester |first=Nancy |title=Women's Use of Force: Complexities and Challenges of Taking the Issue Seriously |journal=[[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] |volume=8 |issue=11 |date=November 2000 |pages=1390–1415 |doi=10.1177/107780102762478055}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second polemic argues that IPV against men is a significant problem and underreported, and that it puts women in even greater risk of victimization by abusive men, which domestic violence researchers and [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] have ignored in order to protect the fundamental gains of the battered women's movement, specifically, the view that intimate partner abuse is an extension of [[Patriarchy|patriarchal dominance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The gender paradigm in domestic violence research and theory: Part 1 — The conflict of theory and data |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |date=September 2005 |volume=10 |issue=6 |last1=Dutton |first1=Donald G. |last2=Nicholls |first2=Tonia L. |pages=680–714 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2005.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thirty years"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A. |date=June 2010 |title=Thirty Years of Denying the Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence: Implications for Prevention and Treatment |url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf |journal=Partner Abuse |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=332–362 |accessdate=2014-06-28 |doi=10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YBVGswoPYqMC&amp;pg=PA79 |title=Current Controversies on Family Violence |last=Loseke |first=Donileen R. |last2=Gelles |first2=Richard J. |last3=Cavanaugh |first3=Mary M. |date=2005 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=9780761921066 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the tools used to generate statistics concerning IPV perpetration, the [[conflict tactics scale]], is especially contentious.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Determining the rate of [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV) against males can be difficult, as men may be reluctant to report their abuse or seek help.&lt;ref name="Crime Council"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Attitudes"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Journal of Applied Social Psychology]] |volume=39 |issue=7 |title=Attitudes and Attributions Associated With Female and Male Partner Violence |last1=Robertson |first=Kristen |last2=Murachver |first2=Tamar |date=July 2009 |pages=1481–1512 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2009.00492.x}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DAP"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.delcotimes.com/general-news/20131007/help-domestic-abuse-victims-for-35-years |date=July 10, 2013 |first=Vince |last=Sullivan |accessdate=2014-06-30 |work=The Delco Times |title=Help domestic abuse victims for 35 years}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male victims of IPV may face socio-cultural issues pertaining to [[hegemonic masculinity]] such as judgement by male peers, fear of coming out as LGBTQ, or having their masculinity questioned.&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse" /&gt; IPV against men is generally less recognized by society than IPV against women.&lt;ref name="Clearinghouse"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="Framework"/&gt; For a man to admit he is the victim of female perpetrated IPV necessitates the abandonment of the veneer of [[machismo]] which society expects from men, and to admit being submissive to a female partner.

On the other hand, many abusive men readily adopt a victim identity. For example, [[O. J.

Researchers have demonstrated a degree of socio-cultural acceptance of aggression by women against men as opposed to a general condemnation of aggression by men against women. Male-on-female IPV has been shown to cause significantly more fear and more severe injuries than female-on-male violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=E. Caldwell |first=Jennifer |last2=C.

However, analyses of research indicates that frequently the legal system fails to view women who use IPV against controlling male partners as victims due to gendered high expectations on women to be the "perfect victim" and the culturally pervasive stereotype of the passive, "cowering" battered woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Goodmark |first=Leigh |year=2008 |title=When Is a Battered Woman Not a Battered Woman?

Statistics indicate that under-reporting is an inherent problem with IPV irrespective of gender. For example, in England and Wales, the 1995 "[[Home Office]] Research Study 191", carried out as a supplementary study to the British Crime Survey, reported 6.6 million incidents of IPV in the previous twelve months, compared with the 987,000 incidents found by the Crime Survey. The difference in the two reports was that Study 191 was a questionnaire of a random representative sample of people, while the Crime Survey attained its figures from crime records, i.e. actual reported cases of IPV.&lt;ref name="Survey 191"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/hors191.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110314171826/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs/hors191.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-03-14 |title=Domestic Violence: Findings from a new British Crime Survey self-completion questionnaire |last=Mirrlees-Black |first=Catriona |pages=17–26 |date=1999 |publisher=Home Office |location=London |accessdate=2014-07-04 |isbn=9781840821932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supplementary studies carried out in 2001 and from 2004 onwards have consistently recorded significantly higher rates of IPV (committed against both men and women) than the standard crime surveys.&lt;ref name="Dewar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dewar4research.org/DOCS/websiteGovtStatsonDV1995-2013.pdf |title=Government Statistics on Domestic Violence |date=February 2014 |publisher=Dewar Research |accessdate=2014-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010–2011 report found that whilst 27% of women who experienced IPV reported it to the police, only 10% of men did so, and whilst 44% of women reported to some professional organization, only 19% of men did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116483/hosb0212.pdf |title=Homicides, Firearm Offences and Intimate Violence, 2010/2011: Supplementary Volume 2 to Crime in England and Wales, 2010/2011 |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=Kevin |chapter=Intimate violence: 2010/11 BCS |last=Britton |first=Andrew |page=96 |date=2011 |publisher=Home Office |location=London |accessdate=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 report carried out by the National Crime Council in the Republic of Ireland, it was estimated that 5% of men who had experienced IPV had reported it to the authorities, compared to 29% of women.&lt;ref name="Crime Council"/&gt;

===Estimates of male victimization===
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the 1995 "Home Office Research Study 191" surveyed 10,844 people (5,886 women and 4,958 men) between the ages of 16 and 59, finding that for the twelve-month period preceding the survey, 4.2% of men had experienced IPV. Over a lifetime, this figure increased to 14.9% of men. Of the 6.6 million incidents of IPV in 1995, 3.25 million involved male victims, with 1 million incidents resulting in injury.&lt;ref name="Survey 191"/&gt; Since 2004, more detailed annual records have been maintained as a supplementary survey attached to the annual Home Office ''Crime in England and Wales'' reports. These reports have consistently recorded significantly higher rates of both male and female victims of IPV than the standard crime surveys. In the case of male victims, the figures range from a high of 4.5% in 2007/2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/hosb0209.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110220105210/rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs09/hosb0209.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-02-20 |title=Homicides, Firearm Offences and Intimate Violence, 2010/2011: Supplementary Volume 2 to Crime in England and Wales, 2007/2008 |editor-last=Povey |editor-first=David |chapter=Intimate violence: 2007/08 BCS |last=Roe |first=Stephen |page=66 |date=2009 |publisher=Home Office |location=London |accessdate=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a low of 3.1% in 2009/2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116512/hosb0111.pdf |title=Homicides, Firearm Offences and Intimate Violence, 2009/2010: Supplementary Volume 2 to Crime in England and Wales, 2009/2010 |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=Kevin |chapter=Intimate violence: 2009/10 BCS |last=Hall |first=Philip |page=82 |date=2011 |publisher=Home Office |location=London |accessdate=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a 2005 report carried out by the National Crime Council found that 15% of women and 6% of men had suffered severe IPV in their lifetime, equating to roughly 213,000 women and 88,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.crimecouncil.gov.ie/downloads/Abuse_Report_NCC.pdf |title=Domestic Abuse of Women and Men in Ireland: Report on the National Study of Domestic Abuse |last1=Watson |first1=Dorothy |last2=Parsons |first2=Sara |publisher=National Crime Council of Ireland |location=Dublin |date=2005 |page=24 |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Northern Ireland]], police records for 2012 listed 2,525 male victims of domestic violence, an increase of 259 cases from 2011.&lt;ref name="McNeilly"&gt;{{cite news |title=Domestic violence against men at its highest level in Northern Ireland since police began recording statistics |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/domestic-violence-against-men-at-its-highest-level-in-northern-ireland-since-police-began-recording-statistics-29707051.html |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=2014-06-30 |work=[[The Belfast Telegraph]] |first=Claire |last=McNeilly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CDC Director Tom Frieden stated, "This report suggests that lesbians, gay men and bisexuals in this country suffer a heavy toll of sexual violence and stalking committed by an intimate partner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/25/us-usa-gays-violence-idUSBRE90O11W20130125 |first=Susan |last=Heavey |title=Data shows domestic violence, rape an issue for gays |agency=Reuters |date=January 25, 2013 |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New Zealand]], the twenty-one year [[Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study]], published in 1999, reported that of their sample of 1,037 people, 27% of women and 34% of men reported being physically abused by a partner, with 37% of women and 22% of men reporting they had perpetrated IPV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moffitt |first=Terrie E. |author1link=Terrie Moffitt |last2=Caspi |first2=Avshalom E. |date=July 1999 |title=Findings About Partner Violence From the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/170018.pdf |page=2 |journal=National Institute of Justice: Research in Brief |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in New Zealand, a 2009 report by the ''[[Journal of Applied Social Psychology]]'' evaluated samples of university students (35 female, 27 male), general population (34 female, 27 male), and incarcerated participants (15 female, 24 male), and found that 16.7% of the male respondents reported physical abuse (12.9% for students and 15.4% for convicts), while 29.5% reported bidirectional (i.e. both partners commit IPV) violence (14.5% for students and 51.3% for convicts).&lt;ref name="Attitudes"/&gt;

The 2006 International Dating Violence Study, which investigated IPV amongst 13,601 students across thirty-two-nations found that "about one-quarter of both male and female students had physically attacked a partner during that year". It reported that 24.4% of males had experienced minor IPV and 7.6% had experienced "severe assault".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Straus |first=Murray A. |date=March 2008 |title=Dominance and symmetry in partner violence by male and female university students in 32 nations |url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/ID41-PR41-Dominance-symmetry-In-Press-07.pdf |journal=Children and Youth Services Review |volume=30 |issue=3 |page=258 |accessdate=2014-06-28 |doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2007.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender symmetry==
[[File:Femme battant mari Durer XVII e siecle.jpg|thumb|right|"Femme battant son mari"; [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
The theory that women perpetrate IPV at roughly similar rates as men has been termed "gender symmetry". The earliest empirical evidence of gender symmetry was presented in the 1975 U.S. National Family Violence Survey carried out by Murray A. Straus and [[Richard Gelles|Richard J. Gelles]] on a nationally representative sample of 2,146 "intact families". The survey found 11.6% of men and 12% of women had experienced some kind of IPV in the last twelve months, while 4.6% of men and 3.8% of women had experienced "severe" IPV.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite book |title=Intimate Violence: The Causes and Consequences of Abuse in the American Family |last1=Gelles |first1=Richard J. |last2=Straus |author1link=Richard James Gelles |first2=Murray A. |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |pages=104 |year=1988 |url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/Straus-Intimate%20Partner%20Violence-Book.pdf |accessdate=2014-07-05 |isbn=978-0-671-68296-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332 |title=Thirty Years of Denying the Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence: Implications for Prevention and Treatment |journal=Partner Abuse |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=332–62 |year=2010 |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A}}&lt;/ref&gt; These unexpected results led Suzanne K.

Since 1975, numerous other empirical studies have found evidence of gender symmetry in IPV. For example, in the United States, the National Comorbidity Study of 1990-1992 found 18.4% of men and 17.4% of women had experienced minor IPV, and 5.5% of men and 6.5% of women had experienced severe IPV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kessler |first1=Ronald C. |author1link=Ronald C.

An especially controversial aspect of the gender symmetry debate is the notion of bidirectional or reciprocal IPV (i.e. when both parties commit violent acts against one another). Findings regarding bidirectional violence are particularly controversial because, if accepted, they can serve to undermine one of the most commonly cited reasons for female perpetrated IPV; self-defense against a controlling male partner. Despite this, many studies have found evidence of high levels of bidirectionality in cases where women have reported IPV. For example, social activist [[Erin Pizzey]], who established the first [[women's shelter]] in the U.K. in 1971, found that 62 of the first 100 women admitted to the centre were "violence-prone," and just as violent as the men they were leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=From the Personal to the Political |last=Pizzey |first=Erin |authorlink=Erin Pizzey |title=Women or Men: Who Are the Victims? |editor1-last=Pizzey |editor1-first=Erin |editor2-last=Shackleton |editor2-first=J.R. |editor3-last=Urwin |editor3-first=Peter |publisher=Civitas |location=London |date=2000 |page=27 |url=http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/cs09.pdf |accessdate=2014-06-28 |isbn=978-1-903386-09-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1975 National Family Violence Survey found that 27.7% of IPV cases were perpetrated by men alone, 22.7% by women alone and 49.5% were bidirectional.

Whitaker,  Tadesse Haileyesus, Monica Swahn,  and Linda S. Saltzman, of 11,370 heterosexual U.S. adults aged 18 to 28 found that 24% of all relationships had some violence. Of those relationships, 49.7% of them had reciprocal violence. In relationships without reciprocal violence, women committed 70% of all violence. However, men were more likely to inflict injury than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitaker |first1=Daniel |title=Differences in Frequency of Violence and Reported Injury Between Relationships With Reciprocal and Nonreciprocal Intimate Partner Violence |journal=Am J Public Health |date=May 2007 |volume=97 |issue=5 |pages=941–947 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020 |pmc=1854883 |pmid=17395835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Philip W. Cook]] conducted a study of 55,000 members of the [[United States Armed Forces]], finding bidirectionality in 60-64% of IPV cases, as reported by both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Abused Men: The Hidden Side of Domestic Violence |last=Cook |first=Phillip W. |authorlink=Philip W.

In 2000, John Archer conducted a [[meta-analysis]] of eighty-two IPV studies. He found that "women were slightly more likely than men to use one or more acts of physical aggression and to use such acts more frequently. Men were more likely to inflict an injury, and overall, 62% of those injured by a partner were women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Archer |first=John |title=Sex differences in aggression between heterosexual partners: a meta-analytic review |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=126 |issue=5 |pages=651–680 |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.5.651 |pmid=10989615 |date=September 2000 |ref=harv |postscript=.}} [http://www.batteredmen.com/ArcherSexDifferencesMeta-AnalyticReviewf2000.pdf Pdf.]

As both Fiebert and Archer point out, although the numerical tally of physical acts in these studies has found similar rates of IPV amongst men and women, and high rates of bidirectionality, there is general agreement amongst researchers that male violence is a more serious phenomenon, primarily, but not exclusively, because male violence tends to inflict more psychological and physical damage than female violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vivian |first1=Dina |last2=Langhinrichsen-Rohling |first2=Jennifer |title=Are bi-directionality violent couples mutually victimized?

From 2010 to 2012, scholars of domestic violence from the U.S., Canada and the U.K. assembled The Partner Abuse State of Knowledge, a research database covering 1700 peer-reviewed studies, the largest of its kind. Among its findings:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerpub.com/media/springer-journals/FindingsAt-a-Glance.pdf Partner Abuse State of Knowledge Project Findings At-a-Glance], Sponsored by the Journal Partner Abuse, John Hamel, LCSW, Editor-in-Chief, www.springerpub.com/pa, November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

* More women (23%) than men (19.3%) have been assaulted at least once in their lifetime.
* Rates of female-perpetrated violence are higher than male-perpetrated (28.3% vs. 21.6%).
* Male and female IPV are perpetrated from similar motives.
* Studies comparing men and women in the power/control motive have mixed results overall.

A 2013 review examined studies from five [[continents]] and the correlation between a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence. The authors found that when partner abuse is defined broadly to include emotional abuse, any kind of hitting, and who hits first, partner abuse is relatively even. They also stated if one examines who is physically harmed and how seriously, expresses more fear, and experiences subsequent psychological problems, domestic violence is significantly gendered toward women as victims.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Esquivel-Santovena |first1=Esteban Eugenio | last2=Lambert | first2=Teri | last3=Hamel | first3=John | title = Partner abuse worldwide | journal = Partner Abuse | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1891/1946-6560.4.1.e14 |url =http://domesticviolenceresearch.org/pdf/PASK.Tables14.Revised.pdf| date = January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict tactics scale===
{{anchor|The CTS}}
In a 2002 review of the research presenting evidence of gender symmetry, [[Michael Kimmel]] noted that more than 90% of "systematic, persistent, and injurious" violence is perpetrated by men. He was especially critical of the fact that the majority of the empirical studies reviewed by Fiebert and Archer used the [[conflict tactics scale]] (CTS) as the sole measure of domestic violence, and that many of the studies used samples composed entirely of single people under the age of thirty, as opposed to older married couples.&lt;ref name="Kimmel"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kimmel |first=Michael S. |author-link=Michael Kimmel |title='Gender symmetry' in domestic violence: a substantive and methodological research review |journal=[[Violence Against Women (journal)|Violence Against Women]] |volume=8 |issue=11 |pages=1332–1363 |publisher=[[Sage Publications|Sage]] |doi=10.1177/107780102237407 |date=November 2002 |ref=harv |postscript=.}} [http://www.vawnet.org/assoc_files_vawnet/gendersymmetry.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016110040/http://www.vawnet.org/assoc_files_vawnet/gendersymmetry.pdf |date=October 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the CTS is the most widely used domestic violence measurement instrument in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A. |last2=Douglas |first2=Emily M. |author-link1=Murray A.

Kimmel argues that the CTS is particularly vulnerable to reporting bias because it depends on asking people to accurately remember and honestly report incidents which have occurred up to a year previously. Even Straus admitted that the data indicates men tend to underestimate their use of violence, and women tend to overestimate their use of violence. "He attempts to control for this by examining only reports from women. Yet this does not correct the bias, because women also tend to underestimate men’s use of violence. Furthermore, men and women alike tend to overestimate women’s use of violence. Violence by men is expected, so it is not reported; violence by women is not expected, so it is notable and reported."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Thus men will overestimate their victimization and underestimate their perpetration, while women will underestimate their victimization and overestimate their perpetration.&lt;ref name="Kimmel"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Barbara J. Morse and Malcolm J. George have presented data suggesting that male underestimation of their partner's violence is more common in CTS based studies than overestimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morse |first=Barbara J. |title=Beyond the Conflict Tactics Scale: assessing gender differences in partner violence |journal=[[Violence &amp; Victims|Violence and Victims]] |volume=10 |issue=4 |date=December 1995 |pages=251–272 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/springer/vav/1995/00000010/00000004/art00001 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |accessdate=2014-06-21 |pmid=8703839}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=George |first=Malcolm J. |title=Invisible touch |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume=8 |year=2003 |pages=34, 36 |doi=10.1016/S1359-1789(01)00048-9}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linda L.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Contrary to expectations, agreement between partners did not vary with the perpetrator’s gender or with the type of abusive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moffitt |first1=Terrie |last2=Caspi |first2=Avshalom |title=Findings About Partner Violence From the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study |journal=Research in Brief |date=July 1999 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

R. Emerson Dobash and Russell P. Dobash have also criticized the CTS, arguing that it is improper to equate male IPV with female IPV. They question the methodology behind the CTS, the data which stems from it and the theoretical framework used by investigators who champion it, arguing that male aggression is much more severe than female aggression and the two should not be measured by the same tool on the same scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=R.

Another critic, Kersti Yllö, who holds Straus and those who use the CTS accountable for damaging the gains of the battered women's movement, by releasing their findings into the "marketplace of ideas". She argues that, as sociologists committed to ending domestic violence, they should have foreseen the controversy such statistics would cause and the damage it could potentially do to battered women.&lt;ref name="Kersti"/&gt; Similarly, Nancy Worcester refers to studies which find evidence of gender symmetry and high levels of bidirectionality as part of the "[[Antifeminism|anti-feminist backlash]]", arguing that studies which use the CTS demonstrate the "limitations and dangers of a gender-neutral approach to anti-violence work".&lt;ref name="Worcester"/&gt;

Straus argues that it is more harmful to women to attempt to tackle the problem of domestic abuse without proper strategy based on facts: "The research shows that this so-called harmless violence by women because a meta-analysis by Stith and colleagues (2004) found that a woman's perpetration of violence was the strongest predictor of her being a victim of partner violence."&lt;ref name="Symmetry"/&gt;

Straus responded to criticism of the CTS by arguing that it is driven by [[Radical feminism|radical-feminists]] who are uncomfortable with any evidence that women can be as violent as men because it undermines their belief that IPV is an extension of men's desire to subjugate women; "one of the explanations for denying the evidence on gender symmetry is to defend feminism in general. This is because a key step in the effort to achieve an equalitarian society is to bring about recognition of the harm that a [[Patriarchy|patriarchal system]] causes. The removal of patriarchy as the main cause of IPV weakens a dramatic example of the harmful effects of patriarchy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A. |date=June 2010 |title=Thirty years of denying the evidence on gender symmetry in partner violence: implications for prevention and treatment |journal=Partner Abuse |volume=1 |issue=3 |page=349 |doi=10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332}} [http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf Pdf.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718174010/http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf |date=July 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Straus also points out that despite being critical of the CTS, numerous feminist researchers use it for their own research, and that it was CTS based studies which first illustrated and brought to the public's attention the extent of the battered women problem in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Symmetry"/&gt;

==Battered husband syndrome==
The most controversial aspect of female perpetrated IPV is the theory of "battered husband syndrome". In reaction to the findings of the U.S. National Family Violence Survey in 1975,&lt;ref name="National"/&gt; Suzanne K. Steinmetz wrote an article in 1977 in which she coined the term as a correlative to "battered wife syndrome".&lt;ref name="Steinmetz_1977" /&gt; Steinmetz conducted several empirical investigations prior to writing her article. Using a broad-based non-representative sample of fifty-four couples, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 47% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 43%. She further found that while 39% of husbands had thrown objects, 31% of wives had done likewise; 31% of husbands had pushed or shoved their partner, compared to 32% of wives; 20% of husbands had hit their wives, 20% of wives had hit their husbands; 10% of husbands had hit their wives with an object, 10% of wives had hit their husbands with an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steinmetz |first1=Suzanne K. |date=1977 |title=Cycle of Violence: Assertive, Aggressive and Abusive Family Interactions |publisher=Praeger |location=New York |isbn=9780275914769}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, using a sample of fifty-two Canadian college students, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 23% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 21%. Further investigation found that 21% of both husbands and wives had thrown objects; 17% of husbands had pushed or shoved, compared to 13% of wives; 13% of husbands had hit their wives, 13% of wives had hit their husbands; 10% of husbands had hit their wives with an object, 12% of wives had hit their husbands with an object.&lt;ref name="Steinmetz_1977" /&gt;{{rp|501–503}} In a third study, using a random sample of ninety-four people, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 32% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 28%. Further investigation found that 31% of husbands had thrown objects compared to 25% of wives; 22% of husbands had pushed or shoved, compared to 18% of wives; 17% of husbands had hit their wives, 12% of wives had hit their husbands; 12% of husbands had hit their wives with an object, 14% of wives had hit their husbands with an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steinmetz |first1=Suzanne K. |title=The Use of Force for Resolving Family Conflict: The Training Ground for Abuse |journal=The Family Coordinator |volume=26 |issue=1 |date=January 1977 |pages=19–26 |doi=10.2307/581856 |jstor=581856}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings led Steinmetz to conclude that IPV was roughly reciprocal between husbands and wives, with a similar level of intentionality between men and women; "women are as likely to select physical conflict to resolve marital conflict as are men ... women have the potential to commit acts of violence and under certain circumstances, they do carry out these acts".&lt;ref name="Steinmetz_1977" /&gt;{{rp|505}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steinmatz |first1=Suzanne K. |chapter=Wifebeating, husband beating — a comparison of the use of physical violence between spouses to resolve marital fights |title=Battered Women: A Psychosociological Study of Domestic Violence |editor1-last=Roy |editor1-first=Maria |date=1977 |publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold |location=New York |pages=63–72 |isbn=9780442272012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Malcolm J. George, Steinmetz' article "represented a point of departure and antithetical challenge to the otherwise pervasive view of the seemingly universality of female vulnerability in the face of male hegemony exposed by the cases of battered wives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=George |first=Malcolm J. |title=Invisible touch |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume=8 |year=2003 |page=32 |doi=10.1016/S1359-1789(01)00048-9}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinmetz' colleague, [[Richard J. Gelles]], publicly addressed confusion caused by the research and [[Fathers' rights groups|father's rights groups]] "significant distortion" of the data in his public response ''Domestic Violence: Not An Even Playing Field'', "Indeed, men are hit by their wives, they are injured, and some are killed. But, are all men hit by women battered? No. Men who beat their wives, who use emotional abuse and blackmail to control their wives, and are then hit or even harmed, cannot be considered battered men. A battered man is one who is physically injured by a wife or partner and has not physically struck or psychologically provoked her."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fathersmanifesto.net/gelles.htm |title=Richard Gelles:  oh so magnanimous, and dead wrong |website=''fathersmanifesto.net'' |access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinmetz' claims in her article, and her use of the phrase "battered husband syndrome" in particular, aroused a great deal of controversy, with many scholars criticizing research flaws in her work. In particular, she was criticized for not differentiating between verbal and physical aggression or between intentionality and action (wanting to hit was considered the same as actually hitting). For example, [[David Finkelhor]] argues that Steinmetz' methodology was unacceptably unscientific. He argues that her work looks at all violence as fundamentally similar; there is no differentiation between male and female violence, or violence against a child and violence against a wife, such as a mother spanking a child and a father breaking a mother's ribs. Finkelhor sees this as especially important insofar as it does not allow a differentiation between ongoing systemic abuse and once-off violence, or between disciplining a child and beating a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finkelhor |first1=David |authorlink=David Finkelhor |chapter=Common Features of Family Abuse |editor1-last=Finkelhor |editor1-first=David |editor2-last=Hotaling |editor2-first=Gerald T. |editor3-last=Gelles |editor3-first=Richard J. |editor4-last=Straus |editor-first4=Murray A. |title=The Dark Side of Families: Current Family Violence Research |pages=17–30 |date=1983 |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=9780803919358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of female-perpetrated IPV==
The question of what causes female perpetrated IPV is another controversial subject. Donald G. Dutton and Tonia L. Nicholls write that traditional feminist theory "views all social relations through the prism of gender relations and holds, in its [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] view, that men (the [[bourgeoisie]]) hold power advantages over women (the [[proletariat]]) in patriarchal societies and that all domestic violence is either male physical abuse to maintain that power advantage or female defensive violence, used for self-protection".&lt;ref name="Paradigm"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.amen.ie/reports/28004.pdf |title=The gender paradigm in domestic violence research and theory: Part 1 — The conflict of theory and data |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |date=September 2005 |volume=10 |issue=6 |last1=Dutton |first1=Donald G. |last2=Nicholls |first2=Tonia L. |page=682 |accessdate=2014-06-28 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2005.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, any IPV committed by women against men is by way of self-defense. Linda Kelly writes that "in conceding that women do engage in acts of domestic violence, female use of violence is justified as self-defense—a lifesaving reaction of women who are being physically attacked by their male partners. The development of the battered woman syndrome as a defense for crimes committed against abusive male partners, including homicide, evidences the wide acceptance of a woman's use of violence as self-defense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Disabusing the Definition of Domestic Abuse: How Women Batter Men and the Role of the Feminist State |url=https://ir.law.fsu.edu/lr/vol30/iss4/7 |last=Kelly |first=Linda |authorlink=Linda L. Kelly |journal=[[Florida State University Law Review]] |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=806 |date=Summer 2003 |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is that when women commit IPV, it is probably justified because they were previously victims and, therefore, the male was the "primary aggressor." Thus, the woman's violent behavior is caused by her background as a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Leonore E. |title=The Battered Woman Syndrome |publisher=Springer |location=New York |date=1984 |isbn=9780826102522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tower |first1=Leslie E. |last2=Fernandez |first2=Maria Elena |title=English- and Spanish-Speaking Women's Use of Violence |date=January 2008 |journal=[[Journal of Interpersonal Violence]] |pages=23–38 |volume=23 |issue=1 |url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/23/1/21.abstract |accessdate=2014-06-21 |doi=10.1177/0886260507307649}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Carlos Ramírez explains that given the socially accepted model of femininity as one of submission, passivity and abnegation, whatever behavior does not follow this stereotype will be perceived in an exaggerated manner as abnormal and violent. Thus, women will be perceived as disproportionately aggressive even if merely defending themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ramírez |first1=Juan Carlos |title=Madejas entreveradas: Violencia, masculinidad y poder |trans-title=Interlocked skeins: Violence, masculinity and power |year=2005 |publisher=Universidad de Guadalajara |location=Guadalajara |language=Spanish |isbn=978-970-722-360-8}}{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meta-analyses of the research find that the overwhelming majority of women's IPV against male partners is in the context of being victimized.&lt;ref name="pmid18624096" /&gt; A 2010 systematic review of the literature on women's perpetration of IPV found that anger, [[self-defense]] and retaliation were common motivations but that distinguishing between self-defense and retaliation was difficult.&lt;ref name="pmid20823071"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bair-Merritt |first=Megan H |last2=Crowne |first2=Sarah Shea |last3=Thompson |first3=Darcy A |last4=Sibinga |first4=Erica |last5=Trent |first5=Maria |last6=Campbell |first6=Jacquelyn |year=2010 |title=Why Do Women Use Intimate Partner Violence?

For example, in a 1996 study of 1,978 people in England, 21% of women who admitted to committing IPV gave self-defense as a reason. More prevalent reasons were "Get through to" (53%), "Something said" (52%) and "Make do something" (26%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Aggression in British Heterosexual Relationships: A Descriptive Analysis |last1=Carrado |first1=Michelle |last2=George |first2=Malcolm J. |last3=Loxam |first3=Elizabeth |last4=Jones |first4=L. |last5=Templar |first5=Dale |journal=Aggressive Behavior |volume=22 |issue=6 |date=June 1996 |pages=401–415 |url=http://www.batteredmen.com/carrgeo1.htm |accessdate=2014-06-21 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2337(1996)22:6&lt;401::AID-AB1&gt;3.0.CO;2-K}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a five-year study of 978 college students from California, concluded in 1997, Martin S. Fiebert and Denise M. Gonzalez found an IPV rate amongst women of 20%. Within this group, perpetrators were asked to select reasons as to why they assaulted their partner, with the option to choose multiple reasons. The breakdown of reasons had "my partner wasn't sensitive to my needs" as the most prevalent (46%). Also found more frequently than self-defense were "I wished to gain my partner's attention" (44%) and "My partner was not listening to me" (43%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Women who initiate assaults: The reasons offered for such behavior |last1=Fiebert |first1=Martin S. |last2=Gonzalez |first2=Denise M. |journal=Psychological Reports |volume=80 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=583–590 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1997.80.2.583 |pmid=9129375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking beyond self-defense, studies have found a range of causes for female-perpetrated IPV. Writing of the feminist theory which regards reinforcement of patriarchy as a primary cause of IPV, Murray A. Straus writes "Patriarchy and male dominance in the family are clearly among the causes [of IPV], but there are many others. However, with rare exceptions, current offender treatment programs are based on the assumption that the primary cause is male dominance. Thus, they proceed under an erroneous assumption. Illustrative of this fallacious single-cause approach are the state-mandated offender treatment programs that forbid treating other causes, such as inadequate [[anger management]] skills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A. |date=June 2010 |title=Thirty Years of Denying the Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence: Implications for Prevention and Treatment |url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf |journal=Partner Abuse |volume=1 |issue=3 |page=351 |accessdate=2014-06-28 |doi=10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Rose A. Medeiros and Murray A. Straus conducted a study using a sample of 854 students (312 men and 542 women) from two American universities. They identified fourteen specific risk factors common amongst both males and females who had committed IPV; poor anger management, [[antisocial personality disorder]]s, [[borderline personality disorder]]s, pattern of dominating relationships, [[substance abuse]], criminal history, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]s, [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], communication problems, [[jealousy]], [[sexual abuse]] as a child, [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], and a general attitudinal approval of partner violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Medeiros |first1=Rose A. |last2=Straus |first2=Murray A. |chapter=Risk Factors for Physical Violence Between Dating Partners: Implications for Gender-Inclusive Prevention and Treatment of Family Violence |title=Family Approaches to Domestic Violence: A Practitioner's Guide to Gender-Inclusive Research and Treatment |editor1-last=Hamel |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Nicholls |editor2-first=Tonia |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |pages=59–87 |url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/ID28-PR28.pdf |accessdate=2014-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straus states that most female perpetrated IPV is not motivated by self-defense, but by a desire to control their partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2011.04.010 |title=Gender symmetry and mutuality in perpetration of clinical-level partner violence: Empirical evidence and implications for prevention and treatment |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=279 |year=2011 |last1=Straus |first1=Murray A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a study involving 1,104 male and female students in their late teens and early twenties found that women are more likely than men to be controlling and aggressive towards their partners, more likely to demonstrate a desire to control their partners, and more likely to use physical aggression in ensuring that control. The main author of the study, Elizabeth Bates, wrote "this suggests that intimate partner violence may not be motivated by patriarchal values and needs to be studied within the context of other forms of aggression, which has potential implications for interventions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Testing predictions from the male control theory of men's partner violence |date=January 2014 |journal=Aggressive Behavior |volume=40 |issue=1 |last1=Bates |first1=Elizabeth A. |last2=Graham-Kevan |first2=Nicholas |last3=Archer |first3=John |pages=46–50 |doi=10.1002/ab.21499 |pmid=23878077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other explanations for both male and female-perpetrated IPV include [[psychopathology]], anger, revenge, skill deficiency, head injuries, biochemical imbalances, feelings of powerlessness, lack of resources, and frustration.&lt;ref&gt;''Articles'':

Current literature on IPV has alternative viewpoints in relation to gender symmetry theory. A 2008 review published in journal of ''[[Violence &amp; Victims|Violence and Victims]]'' found that although less serious situational violence or altercation was equal for both genders, more serious and violent abuse was perpetrated by men. It was also found that women's physical violence was more likely motivated by self-defense or fear while men's was more likely motivated by control.&lt;ref name="pmid18624096" /&gt; A 2011 systematic review from the journal of ''Trauma Violence Abuse'' also found that the common motives for female on male domestic violence were anger, a need for attention, or as a response to their partner's own violence.&lt;ref name="pmid20823071" /&gt;  Another 2011 review published in the journal of ''[[Aggression and Violent Behavior]]'' also found that although minor domestic violence was equal, more severe violence was perpetrated by men. It was also found that men were more likely to beat up, choke or strangle their partners, while women were more likely to throw things at their partner, slap, kick, bite, punch, or hit with an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134467/1/Content.pdf?accept=1 |title=Gender differences in self-reports of intimate partner violence: A review |last=Chan |first=KL |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |year=2011 |issue=2 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2011.02.008 |volume=16 |pages=167–175 |access-date=2016-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223015704/http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/134467/1/Content.pdf?accept=1 |archive-date=2015-12-23 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have also found different outcomes in men and women in response to intimate partner violence. A 2012 review from the journal ''[[Psychology of Violence]]'' found that women suffered disproportionately as a result of IPV especially in terms of injuries, fear, and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Gender differences in intimate partner violence outcomes |last=Caldwell |first=Jennifer E |journal=Psychology of Violence |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=42&amp;ndash;57 |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |doi=10.1037/a0026296 |year=2012 |ref=harv |postscript=.}} [http://people.cas.sc.edu/swansc/1.swan_web_articles/2012_CaldwellSwan_GenderDiffIPVOutcomes.pdf Pdf.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222165142/http://people.cas.sc.edu/swansc/1.swan_web_articles/2012_CaldwellSwan_GenderDiffIPVOutcomes.pdf |date=December 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42–45}} The review also found that 70% of female victims in one of their studies were "very frightened" in response to intimate partner violence from their partners, but 85% of male victims cited "no fear".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The review also found that IPV mediated the satisfaction of the relationship for women but it did not do so for men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Gender asymmetry is also consistent with government findings. According to government statistics from the US Department of Justice, male perpetrators constituted 96% of federal prosecution on domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Durose |first=Matthew R. |title=Family Violence Statistics Including Statistics on Strangers and Acquaintances |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvs02.pdf |website=bjs.gov |publisher=US Department of Justice |year=2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054500/http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvs02.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another report by the US Department of Justice on non-fatal domestic violence from 2003–2012 found that 76 percent of domestic violence was committed against women and 24 percent were committed against men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Truman |first=Jennifer L. |title=Nonfatal Domestic Violence, 2003–2012 |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf |website=bjs.gov |publisher=US Department of Justice |year=2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117112249/http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf |archive-date=2016-01-17 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ruth M. Mann of the University of Windsor, an expert on sociology and criminology, stated her opposition to the gender symmetry theory of domestic violence on the grounds that women as well as children are the main victims in the "annual pile up" (Coyle, 2001) of victims being murdered by intimate partners and fathers throughout Canada (AuCoin, 2005; Ogrodnik, 2006).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;

==Responses==
Police services in several locations have expanded their domestic violence programs and response units in an effort to deal with IPV against men. [[Women's shelter|Shelters]] specifically for men have been set up in the UK; as of 2010, there are sixty refuge places available to men throughout England and Wales, compared to 7,500 places for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=More than 40% of domestic violence victims are male, report reveals |first=Denis |last=Campbell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/05/men-victims-domestic-violence |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 5, 2010 |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] has also campaigned to spread awareness of the problem of male victimization and to promote reporting of incidents. The country's first shelter for male abuse victims, Men's Aid NI, opened in early 2013. Chairman Peter Morris has remarked, "Domestic violence against men can take many forms, including emotional, sexual and physical abuse and threats of abuse. It can happen in heterosexual and same-sex relationships and, as with domestic abuse against females, can go largely unreported."&lt;ref name="McNeilly"/&gt;

According to some theories, [[emotion]]s are universal phenomena, albeit affected by [[culture]]. Emotions are "internal phenomena that can, but do not always, make themselves observable through expression and behavior".&lt;ref name=Ni&gt;{{cite book|author=Niedenthal, Paula M.|author2=Silvia Krauth-Gruber|author3=Francois Ric|year=2006|title=Psychology of Emotion Interpersonal, Experiential, and Cognitive Approaches|pages=5, 305–342|location=New York, NY|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1841694023}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some emotions are universal and are experienced in similar ways as a reaction to similar events across all cultures, other emotions show considerable cultural differences in their antecedent events, the way they are experienced, the reactions they provoke and the way they are perceived by the surrounding society. According to other theories, termed [[social constructionist]], emotions are more deeply culturally influenced.  The components of emotions are universal, but the patterns are social constructions. Some also theorize that culture is affected by emotions of the people.

==Cultural studies of emotions==
Research on the relationship between culture and emotions dates back to 1872 when Darwin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=C|title=The expression of emotions in man and animals.|year=1998|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  argued that emotions and the expression of emotions are universal. Since that time, the universality of the [[Discrete emotion theory|six basic emotions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekman|first=P|title=Are there basic emotions?|journal=Psychological Review|year=1992|volume=99|pages=550–553|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.99.3.550|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise) has ignited a discussion amongst psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists.  While emotions themselves are universal phenomena, they are always influenced by culture.  How emotions are experienced, expressed, perceived, and regulated varies as a function of culturally normative behavior by the surrounding society.  Therefore, it can be said that culture is a necessary framework for researchers to understand variations in emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richeson|first=P. J. &amp; Boyd, R.|title=Not by genes alone:  How culture transformed human evolution|year=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pioneers==
In Darwin's opening chapter of ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'', (1872/1998) Darwin considered the face to be the preeminent medium of emotional expression in humans, and capable of representing both major emotions and subtle variations within each one.  Darwin's ideas about facial expressions and his reports of cultural differences became the foundation for ethological research strategies.  [[Silvan Tomkins]]' (1962) ''[[Affect Theory]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomkins|first=S.S.|title=Affect, imagery, consciousness: Vol 1. The positive effects|year=1962|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomkins|first=S. S.|title=Affect, imagery, consciousness: Vol 2. The positive affects|year=1962|publisher=Springer|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;) built upon Darwin's research, arguing that facial expressions are biologically based, and universal manifestations of emotions. The research of [[Paul Ekman]] (1971)&lt;ref name="Ekman1971"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ekman|first=P.|title=Universal and cultural differences in facial expressions of emotion|year=1971|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Carroll Izard (1971)&lt;ref name="Izard1971"&gt;{{cite book|last=Izard|first=C. E.|title=The face of emotions|year=1971|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; further explored the proposed universality of emotions, showing that the expression of emotions were recognized as communicating the same feelings in cultures found in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa. Ekman (1971)&lt;ref name="Ekman1971" /&gt; and Izard (1971)&lt;ref name="Izard1971" /&gt; both created sets of photographs displaying emotional expressions that were agreed upon by Americans.  These photographs were then shown to people in other countries with the instructions to identify the emotion that best describes the face. The work of Ekman, and Izard, concluded that facial expressions were in fact universal, innate, and phylogenetically derived.  Some theorists, including Darwin, even argued that "Emotion ... is neuromuscular activity of the face". Many researchers since have criticized this belief and instead argue that emotions are much more complex than initially thought.
In addition to pioneering research in psychology, ethnographic accounts of cultural differences in emotion began to emerge.  Margaret Mead, a cultural anthropologist writes about unique emotional phenomena she experienced while living among a small village of 600 Samoans on the island of Ta'u in her book ''Coming of Age in Samoa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mead|first=M.|title=Coming of age in Samoa: A psychological study of primitive you for western civilization|year=1961|publisher=Morrow|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gregory Bateson, an English anthropologist, social scientist, linguist, and visual anthropologist used photography and film to document his time with the people of Bajoeng Gede in Bali.  According to his work, cultural differences were very evident in how the Balinese mothers displayed muted emotional responses to their children when the child showed a climax of emotion.  In displays of both love (affection) and anger (temper) Bateson's notes documented that mother and child interactions did not follow Western social norms.  The fieldwork of anthropologist [[Jean Briggs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=J. L.|title=Never in anger: Portrait of an Eskimo family|year=1970|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  details her almost two year experience living with the Utku Inuit people in her book ''Never in Anger: Portrait of an Eskimo Family'' .  Briggs lived as the daughter of an Utku family describing their society as particularly unique emotional control.  She rarely observed expressions of anger or aggression and if it were expressed, it resulted in ostracism.

Scholars working on the [[history of emotions]] have provided some useful terms for discussing cultural emotion expression. Concerned with distinguishing a society's emotional values and emotional expressions from an individual's actual emotional experience, William Reddy has coined the term ''[[emotive (sociology)|emotive]]''. In ''The Making of Romantic Love'', Reddy uses cultural counterpoints to give credence to his argument that romantic love is a 12th-century European construct, built in a response to the parochial view that sexual desire was immoral. Reddy suggests that the opposition of sexual ardor and true love was not present in either Heain Japan or the Indian kingdoms of Bengal and Orissa.&lt;ref name=Reddy&gt;{{cite book|author=Reddy, W.|year=2012|title=The Making of Romantic Love: Longing and Sexuality in Europe, South Asia, and Japan, 900–1200 CE|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|isbn=978-0226706276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, these cultures did not share the view of sexual desire as a form of appetite, which Reddy suggests was widely disseminated by the Church. Sexuality and spirituality were not conceived in a way which separated lust from love: indeed, sex was often used as a medium of spiritual worship, emulating the divine love between Krishna and Rada.&lt;ref name=Reddy/&gt; Sexual desire and love were inextricable from one another. Reddy therefore argues that the emotion of romantic love was created in Europe in the 12th century, and was not present in other cultures at the time.&lt;ref name=Reddy/&gt;

==Cultural norms of emotions==
Culture provides structure, guidelines, expectations, and rules to help people understand and interpret behaviors.  Several ethnographic studies suggest there are cultural differences in social consequences, particularly when it comes to evaluating emotions.  For example, as [[Jean Briggs]] described in the Utku Eskimo population, anger was rarely expressed, and in the rare occasion that it did occur, it resulted in social ostracism.  These cultural expectations of emotions are sometimes referred to as display rules.  Psychologists (Ekman &amp; Friesen, 1969;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekman|first=P.|author2=Friesen, W. V.|title=The repertoire of nonverbal behavior: Categories, origins, usage, and coding|journal=Semiotica|year=1969|volume=1|pages=49–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Izard, 1980;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Izard|first=C. E.|title=Cross-cultural perspectives on emotion and emotion communication|year=1980|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=23–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarni, 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarni|first=C.|title=The development of emotional competence|year=1990|publisher=Guilford|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;) believe that these rules are learned during a socialization process.  Ekman and Friesen (1975)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ekman, P.|first=Friesen, W. V.|title=Unmasking the face|year=1975|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;   have also suggested that these  "unwritten codes" govern the manner in which emotions may be expressed, and that different rules may be internalized as a function of an individual's culture, gender or family background.  
Miyamoto &amp; Ryff (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miyamoto|first=Y.|author2=Ryff, C|title=Cultural differences in the dialectical and non-dialectical emotional styles and their implications for health|journal=Cognition and Emotion|year=2011|volume=25|pages=22–30|doi=10.1080/02699931003612114|pmc=3269302}}&lt;/ref&gt;   used the term cultural scripts to refer to cultural norms that influence how people expect emotions to be regulated.   Cultural scripts dictate how positive and negative emotions should be experienced and combined. Cultural scripts may also guide how people choose to regulate their emotions which ultimately influences an individual's emotional experience.  For example, research suggests that in Western cultures, the dominant social script is to maximize positive emotions and minimize negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kityama|first=S.|author2=Markus, H. |author3=Kityama, S. |title=Is there a universal need for positive self-regard?|journal=Psychological Review|year=1999|volume=106|pages=766–794|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.106.4.766|pmid=10560328|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Eastern cultures, the dominant cultural script is grounded in "dialectical thinking" and seeking to find a middle way by experiencing a balance between positive and negative emotions.  Because normative behaviors in these two cultures vary, it should also be expected that their cultural scripts would also vary.  
Tsai et al. (2007)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsai|first=J. L.|author2=Louie, J. Y. |author3=Chen, E. E. |author4=Uchida, Y. |title=Learning what feelings to desire: Socialization of ideal affect through children's storybooks|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2007|volume=33|pages=17–30|doi=10.1177/0146167206292749|pmid=17178927|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  argues that not only do cultural factors influence ideal affect (i.e., the affective states that people ideally want to feel) but that the influence can be detected very early.  Their research suggests that preschool aged children are socialized to learn ideal affect through cultural products such as children storybooks.  They found that European American preschool children preferred excited (vs. calm) smiles and activities more and perceived an excited (vs. calm) smile as happier than Taiwanese Chinese preschoolers.  This is consistent with American best sellers containing more excited and arousing content in their books than the Taiwanese best sellers.  These findings suggest that cultural differences in which emotions are desirable or, ideal affect, become evident very early.

===Culture and emotional experiences===
A cultural syndrome as defined by Triandis (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Harry C. Triandis|last=Triandis|first=H.|title=Cross-cultural perspectives on personality|year=1997|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages=439–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a "shared set of beliefs, attitudes, norms, values, and behavior organized around a central theme and found among speakers of one language, in one times period, and in one geographic region".  Because cultures are shared experiences, there are obvious social implications for emotional expression and emotional experiences.  For example, the social consequences of expressing or suppressing emotions will vary depending upon the situation and the individual.  Hochschild (1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hochschild|first=R.|title=The managed heart|year=1983|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;   discussed the role of feeling rules, which are social norms that prescribe how people should feel at certain times (e.g. wedding day, at a funeral).  These rules can be general (how people should express emotions in general) and also situational (events like birthdays).
Culture also influences the ways emotions are experienced depending upon which emotions are valued in that specific culture.  For example, happiness is generally considered a desirable emotion across cultures.  In countries with more individualistic views such as America, happiness is viewed as infinite, attainable, and internally experienced. In collectivistic cultures such as Japan, emotions such as happiness are very relational, include a myriad of social and external factors, and reside in shared experiences with other people.  Uchida, Townsend, Markus, &amp; Bergseiker (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Uchida|first=Y.|author2=Townsend, S.S.M. |author3=Markus, H.R. |author4=Bergseiker, H.B |title=Emotios as within or between people? Cultural variations in lay theories of emotion expression and inference|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2009|volume=35|pages=1427–1438|doi=10.1177/0146167209347322|issue=11 |pmid=19745200}}&lt;/ref&gt;   suggest that Japanese contexts reflect a conjoint model meaning that emotions derive from multiple sources and involve assessing the relationship between others and the self.  However, in American contexts, a disjoint model is demonstrated through emotions being experienced individually and through self-reflection.  Their research suggests that when Americans are asked about emotions, they are more likely to have self-focused responses "I feel joy" whereas as Japanese typical reaction would reflect emotions between the self and others "I would like to share my happiness with others."

==Culture and emotion regulation==
Emotions play a critical role in interpersonal relationships and how people relate to each other.   Emotional exchanges can have serious social consequences that can result in either maintaining and enhancing positive relationships, or becoming a source of antagonism and discord (Fredrickson, 1998;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fredrickson|first=B. L.|title=What good are positive emotions?|journal=Review of General Psychology|year=1998|volume=2|pages=300–319|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.300|pmid=21850154|issue=3|pmc=3156001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gottman &amp; Levenson, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gottman|first=J. M.|author2=Levensen, R. W.|title=Marital processes predictive of later dissolution: Behavior, physiology, and health|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1992|volume=63|pages=221–233|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.2.221|pmid=1403613|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Even though people may generally "want to feel better than worse" (Larsen, 2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsen|first=R.|title=Toward a science of mood regulation|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=2000|volume=11|pages=129–141|doi=10.1207/S15327965PLI1103_01|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) how these emotions are regulated may differ across cultures.  Research by [[Yuri Miyamoto]] suggests that cultural differences influence emotion regulation strategies.  Research also indicates that different cultures socialize their children to regulate their emotions according to their own cultural norms.  For example, ethnographic accounts suggest that American mothers think that it is important to focus on their children's successes while Chinese mothers think it is more important to provide discipline for their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=P.|author2=Wang, S.|author3=Sandel, T.|author4=Cho, G.|title=Self-esteem as folk theory: A comparison of European American and Taiwanese mothers' beliefs|journal=Parenting: Science and Practice|year=2002|volume=2|pages=209–239|doi=10.1207/S15327922PAR0203_02|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To further support this theory, a laboratory experiment found that when children succeeded on a test, American mothers were more likely than Chinese mothers to provide positive feedback (e.g. "You're so smart!"), in comparison to Chinese mothers who provided more neutral or task relevant feedback (e.g. "Did you understand the questions or did you just guess?"; Ng, Pomerantz, &amp; Lam, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ng|first=F.|author2=Pomerantz, E. |author3=Lam, S. |title=European American and Chinese parents' responses to children's success and failure: Implications for children's responses|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2007|volume=43|pages=1239–1255|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.43.5.1239|pmid=17723048|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;).   This shows how American mothers are more likely to "up-regulate" positive emotions by focusing on their children's success whereas Chinese mothers are more likely to "down-regulate" children's positive emotions by not focusing on their success.
Americans see emotions as internal personal reactions; emotions are about the self (Markus &amp; Kityama, 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markus|first=H. R.|author2=Kityama, S.|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation|journal=Psychological Review|year=2007|volume=98|pages=224–253|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.98.2.224|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  In America, emotional expression is encouraged by parents and peers while suppression is often disapproved.  Keeping emotions inside is viewed as being insincere as well as posing a risk to one's health and well being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=J. M.|author2=Gross, J.

Some research even suggests that emotions that reflect the inner self cannot be separated from emotions that reflect the larger group.  Therefore, unlike American culture, expression of emotions is often discouraged, and suppressing one's individual emotions to better fit in with the emotions of the group is looked at as mature and appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothbaum|first=F.|author2=Pott, M. |author3=Azuma, H. |author4=Miyake, K. |author5=Weisz, J. |title=The development of close relationships in Japan and the US: Pathways of symbiotic harmony and generative tension|journal=Child Development|year=2000|volume=71|pages=1121–1142|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00214|pmid=11108082|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotional perception and recognition===
The role of facial expressions in emotional communication is often debated.  While Darwin believed the face was the most preeminent medium of emotion expression, more recent scientific work challenges that theory.  Furthermore, research also suggests that cultural contexts behave as cues when people are trying to interpret facial expressions.  In everyday life, information from people's environments influences their understanding of what a facial expression means. According to research by Masuda et al. (2008),&lt;ref name=Masuda&gt;{{cite journal|last=Masuda|first=T.|author2=Ellsworth, P. C.|author3=Mequita, B.|author4=Leu, J.|author5=Tanida, S.|author6=Van de Veerdonk, E.|title=Placing the face in context: Cultural differences in the perception of facial emotion|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2008|volume=94|pages=365–381|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.3.365|pmid=18284287|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; people can only attend to a small sample of the possible events in their complex and ever- changing environments, and increasing evidence suggests that people from different cultural backgrounds allocate their attention very differently. This means that different cultures may interpret the same social context in very different ways.  Since Americans are viewed as individualistic, they should have no trouble inferring people's inner feelings from their facial expressions, whereas Japanese people may be more likely to look for contextual cues in order to better understand one's emotional state.  
Evidence of this phenomenon is found in comparisons of Eastern and Western artwork.  In Western art there is a preoccupation with the face that does not exist in Eastern art. For example, in Western art the figure occupies a larger part of the frame and is clearly noticeably separated from the ground. In East Asian artwork, the central figure is significantly smaller and also appears to be more embedded in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisbett|first=R. E.|author2=Masuda, T.|title=Culture and point of view|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|year=2003|volume=100|pages=11163–70|doi=10.1073/pnas.1934527100|pmc=196945|bibcode=2003PNAS..10011163N}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a laboratory setting, Masuda et al.&lt;ref name=Masuda/&gt; also tested how sensitive both Americans and Japanese would be to social contexts by showing them pictures of cartoons that included an individual in the context of a group of four other people. They also varied the facial expressions of the central figure and group members.  They found that American participants were more narrowly focused with judging the cartoon's emotional states than the Japanese participants were.  In their recognition task they also observed that the Japanese participants paid more attention to the emotions of the background figures than Americans did.

==Individualistic vs. collectivistic cultures==
Contemporary literature has traced the influence of culture on a variety of aspects of emotion, from emotional values to [[Regulation of emotion|emotion regulation]]. Indeed, culture may be best understood as a channel through which emotions are molded and subsequently expressed. Indeed, this had been most extensively discussed in psychology by examining [[Individualism|individualistic]] and [[Collectivism|collectivistic]] cultures.

The individualistic vs. collectivistic cultural paradigm has been widely used in the study of emotion psychology. Collectivistic cultures are said to promote the [[interdependence]] of individuals and the notion of social harmony.  Indeed, Niedenthal suggests that: "The needs, wishes, and desires of the collectives in which individuals find themselves are emphasized, and the notion of individuality is minimized or even absent from the cultural model".&lt;ref name=Ni/&gt; Individualistic cultures, however, promote individual autonomy and [[independence]]. Individual needs, wishes, and desires are emphasized and the possibility of personal attainment is encouraged. Collectivistic cultures include those of Asia and Latin America, whilst individualistic cultures include those of North America and Western Europe. North America, specifically, is seen to be the prototype of an individualistic culture.&lt;ref name=Ni/&gt;
 
Research has shown that the collectivism vs. individualism paradigm informs cultural emotional expression. An influential paper by Markus &amp; Kitayama, on the influence of culture on emotion, established that in more collectivistic cultures, emotions were conceived as relational to the group.&lt;ref name=Markus&gt;{{cite journal|author=Markus, H.|author2=Kitayama, S.|last-author-amp=yes|year=1991|title=Culture and the self: Implications for cognition, emotion, and motivation|journal=Psychological Review|volume=98|pages=224–253|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.98.2.224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in collectivistic cultures, emotions are believed to occur between people, rather than within an individual.&lt;ref name= Markus/&gt; When Japanese school students were asked about their emotions, they usually stated than an emotion comes from their outside social surroundings.&lt;ref name=Uchida/&gt; When asked about where the emotions they feel originate from, Japanese school students never referred to themselves first.&lt;ref name=Uchida/&gt; This suggests that Japanese people believe emotions exist within the environment, between individuals, in line with collectivistic values.&lt;ref name=Uchida&gt;{{cite journal|author=Uchida, Y.|author2=Townsend, S. S. M.|author3=Markus, H. R.|author4=Bergsieker, H. B.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2009|title=Emotions as within or between people? Cultural variation in lay theories of emotion expression and inference|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=35|pages=1427–1439|doi=10.1177/0146167209347322|pmid=19745200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individualistic cultures, however, conceive emotions as independent internal experiences, occurring within an individual. When American school students were asked about their emotions, they usually stated that they experienced emotions within themselves.&lt;ref name=Uchida/&gt; This suggests that Americans consider emotions as personal, experienced internally and independently.  Markus &amp; Kitayama purport that emotions like friendliness and shame - which promote interconnectedness - are predominant in Asian culture. Conversely, European-American cultures were shown to be predominated by individualistic emotions, such as pride or anger.&lt;ref name=Markus/&gt;

===Emotion suppression===
Collectivistic cultures are believed to be less likely to express emotions, in fear of upsetting social harmony. Miyahara, referencing a study conducted on Japanese interpersonal communication, purports that the Japanese "are low in self disclosure, both verbally and non-verbally....Most of these attributes are ascribed to the Japanese people's collectivistic orientations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Miyahara, Akira|title=Toward Theorizing Japanese Communication Competence from a Non-Western Perspective|journal=American Communication Journal|volume=3|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study conducted showed that Japanese individuals have a relatively low expression of emotion. Niedenthal further suggests that: "Emotional moderation in general might be expected to be observed in collectivist cultures more than in individualistic cultures, since strong emotions and emotional expression could disrupt intra-group relations and smooth social functioning".&lt;ref name=Ni/&gt;

Individualistic cultures are seen to express emotions more freely than collectivistic cultures. In a study comparing relationships among American and Japanese individuals, it was found that: "People in individualistic cultures are motivated to achieve closer relationships with a selected few, and are willing to clearly express negative emotions towards others".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Takahashi, Keiko Naomi Ohara|author2=Toni C. Antonucci|author3=Hiroko Akiyama|title=Commonalities and differences in close relationships among the Americans and Japanese: A comparison by the individualism/collectivism concept|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|volume=26|number=5|date=September 1, 2002|pages=453–465|doi=10.1080/01650250143000418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Butler et al., found that the social impact of [[Regulation of emotion|emotion suppression]] is moderated by the specific culture. Whilst the suppression of emotion by those with European Americans values led to non-responsive reactions and hostility, individuals with bicultural Asian-American values were perceived as less hostile and more engaged when they suppressed their emotions.&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite journal|author=Butler, E. A.|author2=Lee, T. L.|author3=Gross, J. J.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2007| title=Emotion regulation and culture: Are the social consequences of emotion suppression culture-specific?|journal=Emotion|volume=7|pages=30–48|pmid=17352561|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.7.1.30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, individuals with Asian-American values were more skilled in emotional suppression than individuals with European-American values. The article explanation is that Asian-Americans may engage in habitual suppression more often as negative emotions are seen to cause social disharmony and thus contradict cultural values.&lt;ref name=Butler/&gt;

===Culture and emotion socialization===
Research undertaken in the socialization of children cross-culturally has shown how early cultural influences start to affect emotions. Studies have shown the importance of socializing children in order to imbue them with emotional competence.&lt;ref name=Fried&gt;{{cite journal|author=Friedlmeier, W.|author2=Corapci, F.|author3=Cole, P. M.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2011|title=Socialization of emotions in cross-cultural perspective|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=5|issue=7|pages=410–427|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00362.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Friedlmeier et al., suggests children must be socialized in order to meet the emotional values and standards of their culture.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; For instance, in dealing with negative emotions, American parents were more likely to encourage emotion expression in children, thus promoting autonomy and individualistic competence.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; East Asian parents, however, attempted to minimize the experience of the negative emotion, by either distracting their child or trying to make their child suppress the emotion. This promotes relational competence and upholds the value of group harmony.&lt;ref name=Fried/&gt; Children are thus socialized to regulate emotions in line with cultural values.
 
Further research has assessed the use of storybooks as a tool with which children can be socialized to the emotional values of their culture.&lt;ref name=Tsai&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tsai J.L.|author2=Louie J.Y.|author3=Chen E.E.|author4=Uchida Y.|year=2007|title=Learning what feelings to desire: Socialization of ideal affect through children's storybooks|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=33|issue=1|pages=17–30|doi=10.1177/0146167206292749|pmid=17178927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiwanese values promote ideal affect as a calm happiness, where American ideal affect is excited happiness.&lt;ref name=Tsai/&gt; Indeed, it was found that American preschoolers preferred excited smiles and perceived them as happier than Taiwanese children did, and these values were seen to be mirrored in storybook pictures.&lt;ref name=Tsai/&gt; Importantly, it was shown that across cultures, exposure to story books altered children's preferences. Thus, a child exposed to an exciting (versus calm) book, would alter their preference for excited (versus calm) activity.&lt;ref name=Tsai/&gt; This shows that children are largely malleable in their emotions, and suggests that it takes a period of time for cultural values to become ingrained.

Another study has shown that American culture values ''high arousal positive states'' such as excitement, over ''low arousal positive states'' such as calmness.&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tsai J.L.|author2=Miao F.F.|author3=Seppala E.|author4=Fung H.H.|author5=Yeung D.Y. |year=2007 |title=Influence and adjustment goals: Sources of cultural differences in ideal affect |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=92 |issue=6 |pages=1102–1117 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.1102 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30495759/tsai2007.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1450571293&amp;Signature=jtDjE233%2B5nTM9%2Fdit%2FASsPegUs%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DInfluence_and_Adjustment_Goals_Sources_o.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=17547491}}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Chinese culture ''low arousal positive states'' are preferable to ''high arousal positive states''. The researchers provide a framework to explain this, suggesting that ''high arousal positive states'' are needed in order to influence someone else, where ''low arousal positive states'' are useful for adjusting to someone else.&lt;ref name=Miao/&gt; This explanation is in line with the collectivism-individualism dichotomy: American values promote individual autonomy and personal achievement, where Asian values promote relational harmony. Emotion expression is consequently seen to be influenced largely by the culture in which a person has been socialized.

===Culture of honor===
Nisbett &amp; Cohen's 1996 study ''Culture of Honor'' examines the violent [[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|honor culture]] in the Southern states of the USA. The study attempts to address why the southern USA is more violent, with a higher homicide rate, than its northern counterpart.  It is suggested that the higher rate of violence is due to the presence of a 'culture of honor' in the southern USA.&lt;ref name=Nisbett&gt;{{cite book|author=Nisbett, R.E.|author2=Cohen, D.|last-author-amp=yes|year=1996|title=Culture of honor: The psychology of violence in the South |location=Boulder, CO|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=978-0813319933}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of experiments was designed to determine whether southerners got angrier than northerners when they were insulted. In one example, a participant was bumped into and insulted, and their subsequent facial expressions were coded. Southerners showed significantly more anger expressions.&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt; Furthermore, researchers measured cortisol levels, which increase with stress and arousal, and testosterone levels, which increase when primed for aggression. In insulted southerners, cortisol and testosterone levels rose by 79% and 12% respectively, which was far more than in insulted northerners.&lt;ref name=Nisbett/&gt; With their research, Nisbett &amp; Cohen show that southern anger is expressed in a culturally specific manner.

==Challenges in cultural research of emotions==
One of the biggest challenges in cultural research and human emotions is the lack of diversity in samples.  Currently, the research literature is dominated by comparisons between Western (usually American) and Eastern Asian (usually Japanese or Chinese) sample groups.  This limits our understanding of how emotions vary and future studies should include more countries in their analyses.
Another challenge outlined by Matsumoto (1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matsumoto|first=D.|title=Cultural similarities and differences in display rules|journal=Motivation and Emotion|year=1990|volume=14|issue=3|pages=195–214|doi=10.1007/BF00995569}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is that culture is ever changing and dynamic.  Culture is not static.  As the cultures continue to evolve it is necessary that research capture these changes.  Identifying a culture as "collectivistic" or "individualistic" can provide a stable as well as inaccurate picture of what is really taking place.  No one culture is purely collectivistic or individualistic and labeling a culture with these terms does not help account for the cultural differences that exist in emotions.   As Matsumoto argues, a more contemporary view of cultural relations reveals that culture is more complex than previously thought.  
Translation is also a key issue whenever cultures that speak different languages are included in a study.  Finding words to describe emotions that have comparable definitions in other languages can be very challenging.  For example, happiness, which is considered one of the six basic emotions, in English has a very positive and exuberant meaning.  In Hindi, [[Sukhi]] is a similar term however it refers to peace and happiness. Although happiness is a part of both definitions, the interpretation of both terms could lead to researchers to making assumptions about happiness that actually do not exist.

===Further research===
Studies have shown that Western and Eastern cultures have distinct differences in emotional expressions with respect to hemi-facial asymmetry; Eastern population showed bias to the right hemi-facial for positive emotions, while the Western group showed left hemi-facial bias to both negative and positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mandal M. K.|author2=Harizuka S.|author3=Bhushan B.|author4=Mishra R.C.|last-author-amp=yes|year=2001|title=Cultural variation in hemi-facial asymmetry of emotion expressions|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=40|pages=385–398|doi=10.1348/014466601164885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the valence and arousal of the twelve most popular emotion keywords expressed on the micro-blogging site Twitter were measured using latent semantic clustering in three geographical regions: Europe, Asia and North America. It was demonstrated that the valence and arousal levels of the same emotion keywords differ significantly with respect to these geographical regions — Europeans are, or at least present themselves as more positive and aroused, North Americans are more negative and Asians appear to be more positive but less aroused when compared to global valence and arousal levels of the same emotion keywords.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Bann, E. Y.|author2=Bryson, J. J. |year=2013|contribution=Measuring Cultural Relativity of Emotional Valence and Arousal using Semantic Clustering and Twitter|title=Proceedings of the 35th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society|pages=1809–1814|arxiv=1304.7507 |bibcode=2013arXiv1304.7507Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that emotional differences between Western and Eastern cultures can, to some extent, be inferred through their language style.

===Conclusion===
Culture affects every aspect of emotions.  Identifying which emotions are good or bad, when emotions are appropriate to be expressed, and even how they should be displayed are all influenced by culture.  Even more importantly, cultures differentially affect emotions, meaning that exploring cultural contexts is key to understanding emotions.  Through incorporating sociological, anthropological, and psychological research accounts it can be concluded that exploring emotions in different cultures is very complex and the current literature is equally as complex, reflecting multiple views and the hypothesis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3893">The '''Federal Authority for Audiovisual Communication Services''' (Spanish: ''Autoridad Federal de Servicios de Comunicación Audiovisual'', AFSCA) was an agency of the [[government of Argentina]] with the power to regulate television and radio services. It began activities on December 10, 2009, two months after the passage of the [[Law 26,522 of Audiovisual Communications Services]] (Ley de Medios), and replaced the Federal Broadcasting Committee (Comité Federal de Radiodifusión, COMFER).

Its former director was [[Martín Sabbatella]].

==Composition==
The AFSCA was led by a seven-member board, consisting of the following:

*1 president and 1 director named by the [[President of Argentina|president]].
*3 directors nominated by parliamentary committee, each representing one of the top three parliamentary blocs.
*2 directors nominated by the Federal Council for Audiovisual Communication; one of these had to be an academic in the fields of information sciences, communications or journalism from a national university.

==History==
The first predecessor to AFSCA was CONART, the National Radio and Television Commission, which came into being in 1957 under the government of [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu]].

===Federal Broadcasting Committee===
The Federal Broadcasting Committee (Comité Federal de Radiodifusión, COMFER) was formed with the National Telecommunications Law (Law 19,798), passed in 1972 during the ''de facto'' presidency of [[Alejandro Agustín Lanusse]].

When the National Broadcasting Law (Law 22,285) was passed in 1980 during the military government of [[Jorge Rafael Videla]], COMFER retained its status as regulator. From 1980 until 2009, COMFER was run by various managers and directors, each of them named by the president. Law 22,285 specified a governing board consisting of representatives from the army, navy and air force, the secretaries of public information and communications, and representatives of the trade associations for radio and television.

===AFSCA===
AFSCA was formed in 2009 after the passage of Law 26,522. It had the power to award television licenses, regulate programming and sanction violators with fines.

On September 17, 2012, President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] tapped [[Martín Sabbatella]], a former member of the Chamber of Deputies and one-time [[intendant]] of [[Morón, Buenos Aires]], to head up the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Télam|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/nota/38219/|date=2012-09-17|accessdate=2015-05-26|title=El Ejecutivo propuso a Martín Sabbatella como candidato al directorio de la Afsca|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924114547/http://www.telam.com.ar/nota/38219/|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabbatella took the post on October 1.

In December 2015, new president [[Mauricio Macri]] placed AFSCA under the direction of the Ministry of Communications and combined it with AFTIC, the Federal Authority for Information and Communications Technologies. The combined agency is run by [[Miguel De Godoy]], former secretary for media in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=La Nación|first=José|last=Crettaz|date=2015-12-20|accessdate=2015-12-20|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1855857-el-gobierno-reformula-la-afsca-y-modifica-la-ley-de-medios|title=El Gobierno reformula la Afsca y modifica la ley de medios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Idaksahak are a former dependent faction of local [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] [[Iwellemmeden]], formerly serving as ''maraboutic'' (religious experts) and livestock minders for higher caste Tuareg factions.&lt;ref name=torres2009 /&gt;  Despite this history, they predated the Tuareg in the region, and even the [[Songhay Empire]], from which they took their language. They are still sometimes referred to as a ''tewsit'' (clan) of the Iwellemmeden Tuareg. The Idaksahak, like the related Igdalan "were among the first Berbers to migrate to sub-Saharan Africa, sometime between the 8th and 9th centuries"&lt;ref name=torres2009 /&gt; and were among the first Muslim groups in the area.&lt;ref name=torres2009 /&gt;

The Daoussahak remained detached from, and sometimes in conflict with, [[French West Africa|French colonial rule]] as late as the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Bernus (ed.). Nomades et commandants: administration et sociétés nomades dans l'ancienne A.O.F.. KARTHALA Editions, (1993) {{ISBN|978-2-86537-420-5}} p.212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Boilley. Les Touaregs Kel Adagh. KARTHALA Editions, (1999) {{ISBN|978-2-86537-872-2}} p.300&lt;/ref&gt; They were among the first of the rebels who rose against the Malian government in the [[Tuareg Rebellion (1961–1964)|1963-64 rebellion]], an insurgency which was met with brutal suppression across the north of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Sebastian Lecocq. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DRM_AQAAIAAJ That desert is our country: Tuareg rebellions and competing nationalisms in contemporary Mali (1946-1996)]. Universiteit van Amsterdam, (2002). pp.136, 140, 165&lt;/ref&gt;   Daoussahak men also formed armed groups during the [[Tuareg Rebellion (1990–1995)|1990s rebellion]].  The [[Popular Liberation Front of Azawad]](1991-1993)&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marc Balencie, Arnaud de La Grange. Mondes rebelles: guerres civiles et violences politiques.

Daoussahak livestock raiding and conflict with rival [[Fula people|Fula]] pastoralists and farmers continues today, with occasional armed conflict over land, grazing, water, and animals periodically spilling over into the [[Ouallam Department]] of [[Niger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tele-animaux.com/actualite,info,-des-touareg-daoussahak-ont---:8415.html Des Touareg Daoussahak ont une fois de plus attaqué nos paisibles éleveurs] AFP, 20 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maliweb.net/category.php?NID=36217 Le Niger veut sécuriser sa frontière avec le Mali, théâtre de banditisme armé]. APA, 6 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pastoralism==
They now include both sedentary pastoralists and town dwellers, as well as seasonally nomadic pastoralists, herding cattle, goats, and camels from Mali through southern [[Algeria]] and northwest [[Niger]].&lt;ref name=phillips2001 /&gt; [[Transhumance]] patterns continue to take them northeast into the area of Niger inhabited by the [[Igdalen]] related [[Isawaghan]]: sedentary Northern Songhay speakers of [[Ingal]] Niger. The Idaksahak also have a history of transhumance patterns to the southeast, taking them into what is now the [[Ouallam]] area of [[Niger]].&lt;ref name=tainecheikh1989 /&gt;

==Demography, religion, and society==
The Malian population of Idaksahak is estimated at 30,000.&lt;ref name=phillips2001 /&gt;  Idaksahak share with Tuareg a three part caste system of "free masters" (''i-dáksahak''), "craftspeople" (''ʒeem-án'') and the "captives/slaves" (''ṭaam-én'').&lt;ref name='TadaksahakInro' /&gt; One study suggested that of North Songhay speaking communities, the Idaksahak are closest to Tuareg. While culturally similar, Igdalan do not intermarry with Tuareg, while Idaksahak intermarry with both communities.&lt;ref name=RueckChristiansen1999 /&gt; The name ''i-dáksahak'' means "sons of Issac".&lt;ref name=phillips2001 /&gt;  The Idaksahak are [[Muslim]], although many maintain pre-Islamic beliefs and practices.  In Menaka and Ansongo, the Idaksahak live amongst populations of the Igdalan, the Kel Essouk Tuareg, Ihatan Songhay, and Berberiche Arab factions.&lt;ref name=phillips2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name='TadaksahakInro' /&gt;&lt;ref name=torres2009 /&gt;

This article discusses the [[incarceration of women]] in [[Incarceration in the United States|prisons and jails within the United States]]. According to a November 2017 report by the [[World Prison Brief]] around 212,000 of the 714,000 female prisoners worldwide (women and girls) are incarcerated in the United States.&lt;ref name=WFIL&gt;[http://www.prisonstudies.org/news/world-female-imprisonment-list-fourth-edition World Female Imprisonment List (fourth edition)].

(about 65.7 per 100,000 of the national population), Thailand (60.7), El Salvador (58.4), Turkmenistan (about 38.2), Seychelles (34.8), Russian Federation (33.5), French Guiana (32.4), Macau-China (31.3), Rwanda (29.6), Greenland (28.5) and American Samoa (27.3)."

==Prison and jail population==
:''See also: [[List of U.S. states by incarceration and correctional supervision rate]]. It has state by state numbers for female incarceration.''
In the United States in 2015, women made up 10.4% of the incarcerated population in adult prisons and jails.&lt;ref name=cpusa2015&gt;[https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=5870 Correctional Populations in the United States, 2015]. By Danielle Kaeble and Lauren Glaze, ''BJS Statisticians.'' Dec. 2016. [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]]. See [https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus15.pdf PDF]. Appendix table 3 on page 14 has state by state counts and rates of female incarceration. It says there are 1,942,500 male and 202,600 female inmates in prisons and jails. That is 10.4% female.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 2010 the number of males in prison grew by 1.4% per annum, while the number of females grew by 1.9% per annum.  From 2010 to 2013 the numbers fell for both genders, −0.8%  for males and −0.5% for females.  For jails the figures for 2000–10 are 1.8% for males and 2.6% for females, while for 2010–13 they are −1.4% for males and 3.4% for females.&lt;ref name=cpusa2013/&gt; Over this period the female proportion of the incarcerated population has been increasing, at least partly due to compulsory sentencing.

Hispanic women are incarcerated at nearly twice the rate of white women, and black women are incarcerated at four times the rate of white women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Owen|first=Barbara|title=Prisons for Women|year=2010|pages=1195}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the US, the rate of female incarceration increased fivefold in a two decade span ending in 2001; the increase occurred because of increased [[prosecutor|prosecutions]] and [[conviction]]s of offenses related to [[recreational drug]]s, increases in the severity of offenses, and a lack of [[community sanctions]] and treatment for women who violate [[Prohibition of drugs|drug laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Zaitow, Barbara H. and Jim Thomas.

This rapid boom of female prisoners is something the primarily male-dominated prison system was not structurally prepared for and, as a result, female prisons often lack the resources to accommodate the specific social, mental, healthcare needs of these women.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;Acoca, L.

Sage Journals. Web. 12 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The mass incarceration of females in the US has become a major human rights issue that has been widely criticised by international organisations such as [[Human Rights Watch]].

Unlike prisons designed for men in the United States, state prisons for women evolved in three waves, as described in historical detail in "Partial Justice: Women in State Prisons" by [[Nicole Hahn Rafter]]. First, women prisoners were imprisoned alongside men in "general population", where they were subject to sexual attacks and daily forms of degradation. Then, in a partial attempt to address these issues, women prisoners were removed from general population and housed separately, but then subject to neglect wherein they did not receive the same resources as men in prisons. In a third stage of development, women in prison were then housed completely separately in fortress-like prisons, where the goal of punishment was to indoctrinate women into traditional feminine roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Partial Justice: Women in State Prisons, 1800-1935|last=Rafter|first=Nicole Hahn|publisher=Northeastern University Press|year=1985|isbn=0930350634|location=Boston, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the widespread historical shifts in female incarceration, there have been documented instances of women being held in men's prisons well into the twentieth century, one such example being the nearly two years that [[Assata Shakur]] was imprisoned, primarily in men's facilities, in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2013/5/2/ex_black_panther_assata_shakur_added_to_fbis_most_wanted_terrorist_list|title=Former Black Panther Assata Shakur Added to FBI's Most Wanted Terrorist List|last=Shakur|first=Assata|date=May 2, 2013|website=Democracy Now|publisher=|access-date=May 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 Shakur was held in the Middlesex County Jail in New Jersey, supposedly due to its proximity to the courthouse. She was the first, and last, woman ever imprisoned there, and was held in deplorable conditions including isolation and twenty-four hour observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Assata: An Autobiography|last=Shakur|first=Assata|publisher=Lawrence Hill Books|year=2001|isbn=1556520743|location=London|pages=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Shakur was eventually transferred to a women's prison, her treatment illustrates the fact that women were held in male facilities far into the twentieth century, and indicates that racial prejudice continues to play a pivotal role in determining how women are treated during a period of incarceration.

Even though the number of crimes committed by women has remained relatively constant, the rate of imprisonment has continued to increase. {{As of |1997}} over 135,000 women in the United States were in prisons and jails. "More than 950,000 women were under correctional supervision in 1998, about 1% of the US female population. In the past decade, the numbers and proportions of women have increased in terms of all components of the system: jail, probation, parole, and prison".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freudenberg|first1=Nicholas|year=2002|title=Adverse Effects of US Jail and Prison Policies on the Health and Well-Being of Women of Color|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=92|pages=1895–1899|doi=10.2105/ajph.92.12.1895|pmc=1447348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many state that this is a factor of increased incarceration in response to drug offenses. "Approximately 55% of women in prison are serving their first prison sentence. Although drug users are less likely to be imprisoned for violent offenses than non-drug users, women incarcerated for drug convictions are still likely to be placed in maximum-security facilities".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Women and Gender: Sex similarities and differences and the impact of society on gender.

==Gender of guards and staff==
As of 2007, in most of the [[Western world]], the guards in female prisons are exclusively female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Talvi|first=Silja|title=Women Behind Bars: The Crisis of Women in the U.S. Prison System|year=2007|publisher=Seal Press|location=Emeryville|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tz_yT4ho2q4C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=%22In+the+rest+of+the+Western+world,+women+prisoners+are+guarded%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=f9LzTfHfBsahtwe0hpSLBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22In%20the%20rest%20of%20the%20Western%20world%2C%20women%20prisoners%20are%20guarded%22&amp;f=false 56]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the passage of the [[1964 Civil Rights Act]] and the 1972 Equal Employment Opportunity Act, this was true in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Talvi|first=Silja|title=Women Behind Bars: The Crisis of Women in the U.S. Prison System|year=2007|publisher=Seal Press|location=Emeryville|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tz_yT4ho2q4C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=%22In+the+rest+of+the+Western+world,+women+prisoners+are+guarded%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=f9LzTfHfBsahtwe0hpSLBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22In%20the%20rest%20of%20the%20Western%20world%2C%20women%20prisoners%20are%20guarded%22&amp;f=false 56]–[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tz_yT4ho2q4C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22true+in+the+United+States+until+the+passage+of+the+1964%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EdPzTe6_MsG1tgfC4cmJBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22true%20in%20the%20United%20States%20until%20the%20passage%20of%20the%201964%22&amp;f=false 57]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men usually worked in perimeter posts, such as gate posts, rather than having direct contact with female prisoners. Male employees previously had restricted positions. Both acts integrated the workforce, and after the acts passed male employees gained increasingly direct contact with female prisoners.&lt;ref name="Talvi2007_p57"/&gt; As of 2007, about 40% of [[prison guard]]s in American women's prisons are men. In some facilities, most of the prison guards are men: Silja Talvi, author of ''Women Behind Bars: The Crisis of Women in the U.S. Prison System'', argued that in theory [[gender equality]] makes sense in all occupations, but in practice having male guards watch over female prisoners is problematic.&lt;ref name="Talvi2007_p57"&gt;{{cite book|last=Talvi|first=Silja|title=Women Behind Bars: The Crisis of Women in the U.S. Prison System|year=2007|publisher=Seal Press|location=Emeryville|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tz_yT4ho2q4C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22true+in+the+United+States+until+the+passage+of+the+1964%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EdPzTe6_MsG1tgfC4cmJBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22true%20in%20the%20United%20States%20until%20the%20passage%20of%20the%201964%22&amp;f=false 57]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social factors leading to incarceration ==
Understanding the socioeconomic conditions that foster the cycle of mass incarceration is the only way in which the U.S. may improve its prison systems. The exponential growth of female inmates reflects the “pervasive gender mandates” in America as well as women’s lower-ranking social and economic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solinger |first1=Rickie |title=Interrupted Life: Experiences of Incarcerated Women in the United States |date=2010 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a significant number of women are imprisoned for minor offenses (i.e. [[drug-related crime]], [[larceny]]), there are also many social factors that lead up to their detainment, particularly in [[women of color]]. The overrepresentation of minorities and poor people in prison reflects the “deeply entrenched forces of institutional racism and class prejudice.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solinger |first1=Rickie |title=Interrupted Life: Experiences of Incarcerated Women in the United States |date=2010 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Given their history of social exclusion, it seems almost certain that the social condition African American women face prior to their incarceration is marked by extreme powerlessness. One such indicator is a history of sexual abuse both during their childhood years and as adults. Incarcerated African American women represent disproportionately higher rates of sexual abuse cases compared with women who have not been incarcerated". A history of physical or sexual abuse ranges from 40 to 73% of African American inmates.&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henriques|first1=Zelma Weston|last2=Manatu-Rupert|first2=Norma|year=2001|title=Living on the outside: African American women before, during, and after imprisonment|url=|journal=The Prison Journal|volume=81|issue=1|pages=6–19|doi=10.1177/0032885501081001002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Notably, poverty, racism, domestic violence, and addiction intersect to create a “cycle of survival, criminalization, and repeated incarceration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solinger |first1=Rickie |title=Interrupted Life: Experiences of Incarcerated Women in the United States |date=2010 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Interrupted Life: Experiences of Incarcerated Women in the United States'', historian Rickie Solinger believes that four factors contribute to the prison crisis. First, the impacts of globalization and economic restructuring on low-income communities. Second, the war on drugs, a U.S. policy that has been led in global nature. Third, the role of globalization in fueling migration from the global South, the criminalization of migration, and growth of immigrant incarceration. Lastly, emergence of a prison-industrial complex, a relationship between corporate and governmental interests that has led to prison expansion in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solinger |first1=Rickie |title=Interrupted Life: Experiences of Incarcerated Women in the United States |date=2010 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with these items, women’s poverty is criminalized in many ways. In face of declining incomes and few economic opportunities, women often have choice but to turn to the street economy, sex work, petty theft, welfare “fraud,” and other means of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solinger |first1=Rickie |title=Interrupted Life: Experiences of Incarcerated Women in the United States |date=2010 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For many women, personal or domestic violence and sexual abuse are a part of their incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kilgore |first1=James |title=Understanding Mass Incarceration: A People's Guide to the Key Civil Rights Struggle of Our Time |date=2015 |publisher=The New Press |location=New York |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; For poor women especially, experiences of violence, particularly in the household, may incite behavior that leads to arrest and criminal charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kilgore |first1=James |title=Understanding Mass Incarceration: A People's Guide to the Key Civil Rights Struggle of Our Time |date=2015 |publisher=The New Press |location=New York |page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty is also criminalized when women with mental illness, most who have experienced post-traumatic symptoms from childhood and adult trauma, come into contact with the law, either through “antisocial or violent behavior or through self-medication with illegal drugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solinger |first1=Rickie |title=Interrupted Life: Experiences of Incarcerated Women in the United States |date=2010 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, California |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women of color also feel pressured to fit into the 'norm' of what social life should be for women (i.e. be happily married, have a functional family, have a good job and a nice house). This often leads to their conforming and accepting abusive relationships or adapting to their partner's expectations. For example, women who suffer from substance abuse are mainly subjected to it by their partner. Studies showed that women, in fact, believe that engaging in such destructive activities would create a stronger emotional bond, as well as put a halt to the abuse they consistently endure. They assume that because their relationship is going downhill, it must be a failure on their part and decide to make a change, usually for the worse.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;

The disadvantages of black men in society also affect the outcome of women; they have to take on the role of the breadwinner and often, when not making enough, lead to taking alternatives such as involvement with drugs, theft, and prostitution. This of course, leads to their incarceration. The "profile" that surfaces of the black female offender is "that of a young, uneducated, single mother. She is likely to be unemployed, with few marketable skills, and is more likely to be on welfare".&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; Female inmates were also described as "confined by social conditions in their communities, restrained by their families' circumstances, severely limited by abuse in their intimate relationships, and forced to make hard choices with very few options". They are characterized as "compelled to crime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeHart|first1=Dana D|year=2008|title=Pathways to prison impact of victimization in the lives of incarcerated women|url=|journal=Violence Against Women|volume=14|issue=12|pages=1362–1381|doi=10.1177/1077801208327018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences between incarcerated women and men==
Men make up the majority of [[Incarceration in the United States|prisoners in the United States]], approximately ten times as many as women in 2013,&lt;ref name=cpusa2013&gt;[http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=5177 Correctional Populations in the United States, 2013] (NCJ 248479). Published December 2014 by [[U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics]] (BJS). By Lauren E. Glaze and Danielle Kaeble, BJS statisticians. See [http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus13.pdf PDF]. See page 1 "highlights" section for the "1 in ..." numbers. See table 1 on page 2 for adult numbers. See table 5 on page 6 for male and female numbers. See appendix table 5 on page 13, for "Estimated number of persons supervised by adult correctional systems, by correctional status, 2000–2013." See appendix table 2: "Inmates held in custody in state or federal prisons or in local jails, 2000 and 2012–2013".&lt;/ref&gt; the annual growth rate for women in 2004 was 7.5% compared to that of 5.7% for men.&lt;ref name="Pollock"&gt;Pollock, J. (2004). Prisons and prison life: Costs and consequences. Los Angeles: Roxbury Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies show that the way in which men and women cope while imprisoned differs in that women tend to form family structures in an effort to recreate the roles they would normally follow in society; however, men tend to isolate themselves from others and tend to be more aggressive towards the other inmates.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, R. (2002). Hard time: Understanding and reforming the prison (3rd ed.). Belmont, California: Wadsworth&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward, D., &amp; Kasselbaum, G. (1965). Women's prison: Sex and social structure. Chicago: Aldine Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Child care is also another issue that women must worry about when they are incarcerated. According to Mumola, 64% of women were primary guardians for their children prior to being incarcerated compared to men at only 44%. (Mumola) It is likely that men like women experienced [[Traumatic event (psychological)|traumatic events]] in their childhood, but research has shown that women experience a higher rate of trauma.&lt;ref name="Pollock" /&gt;[[File:Women_incarceration_US_Statista.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Women_incarceration_US_Statista.png|thumb|No country in the world incarcerates more women than the [[United States]], as shown by Statista in a 2013 study.]]Because many states have only one female facility, in comparison to having numerous men's facilities, women are forced to stay in that one specific facility.&lt;ref name=cks&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collica|first=K.|title=Surviving incarceration: Two prison-based peer programs build communities of support for female offenders|journal=Deviant Behavior|date=2010|volume=31|issue=4|pages=314–47|doi=10.1080/01639620903004812}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Women do not have the option of transferring to another facility like men do and they "experience additional deprivations"  as they do not have the option to transfer in cases of problematic issues with other inmates or work staff or in cases of desiring to be closer to home.&lt;ref name="cks"/&gt; Women have fewer visits from their children, which is influenced by the fact that women facilities are limited and located mostly in rural areas far from women's hometowns.&lt;ref name="cks"/&gt; When men are in prison, their female partners may take the kids to visit him.&lt;ref name="cks"/&gt; However, due to the statistics on the many of women prisoners being the primary caregivers of children, usually another female family member will take care of her children.&lt;ref name="cks"/&gt;

Those who take care of the children with an incarcerated mother where the mother is the [[primary caregiver]], the financial costs of raising that incarcerated mother's children limits the amount of resources people send to the mother in prison.&lt;ref name="cks"/&gt; Raising a child, specifically in this instance, someone else's child, is costly.&lt;ref name="cks"/&gt; As stated in the source "Surviving incarceration: Two prison-based peer programs build communities of support for female offenders," mothers in prison generally "worry about the welfare of their children, if their children are properly cared for, and if they will be able to maintain long-lasting bonds with their children in lieu of these barriers."&lt;ref name="cks"/&gt;

Incarcerated women also use [[Prison library|prison libraries]] differently from the way male prisoners do. In general, women are less likely to use the law library to "seriously research their own cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Library Services to the Incarcerated : Applying the Public Library Model in Correctional Facility Libraries|last=Clark|first=Sheila|last2=MacCreaigh|first2=Erica|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=2006|isbn=9780313090615|location=Westport, Conn|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe it's because women's sentences are typically shorter and less severe than men's. Often, incarcerated women are seeking information about marital law and child custody and support in prison libraries.

===Death row===
[[File:Entrance to TDCJ Mountain View Unit.jpg|thumb|[[Mountain View Unit]], a state prison for women in [[Gatesville, Texas]] houses the state death row for women]]
The number of women on [[death row]] is significantly less than the number of men, women make up only 2% death row as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenalty.org/article.php?id=86|title=Death Row Population Size and Characteristics|publisher=Death Penalty Focus |accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All the women on death row in the past two centuries committed murder, with the exception of [[Ethel Rosenberg]] who was sentenced to death for espionage.  Women on death row have a relatively low chance of actually being executed: there have only been 571 documented executions from 1632 to 2012.&lt;ref name="Streib"/&gt; Currently, about half of the women on death row are in the top five states for death row sentencing (California, Florida, Texas, North Carolina and Ohio). Although California is the top state for  death sentences, no woman has been executed since 1962.&lt;ref name="Streib"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/FemDeathDec2012.pdf|title=Death Penalty for Female Offenders, January 1, 1973 through December 31, 2012 |format=PDF|last=Streib|first=Victor|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health issues==
{{main|Mental health among female offenders in the United States}}
Although both men and women suffer from mental issues at approximately the same rate, they don't experience the same disorders. Typically women suffer from mood and anxiety disorders, whereas men are more likely to have issues regarding substance abuse and antisocial personalities.&lt;ref name="Sydney"&gt;Sydney, Linda. [http://www.wcl.american.edu/endsilence/documents/14.GenderRepsonsiveStrategies_Community.pdf?rd=1.p. 6. "Gender-Responsive Strategies for Women Offenders."] U.S. Department of Justice National Institute of Corrections, n. pag. 0. ([https://www.webcitation.org/6GbXGJrgt?url=http://www.wcl.american.edu/endsilence/documents/14.GenderRepsonsiveStrategies_Community.pdf Archive])&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to men, women are significantly more likely to seek professional help for their psychiatric problems, however only one-fourth of women follow through and receive treatment. Currently, there is scarce research on female psychological development and psychological health, as well as the effects of the diagnosis and treatment. This makes it difficult to treat women due to issues such as appropriate doses of drugs. In addition, many women have multiple illnesses at once, such as substance abuse, trauma, and mental health issues, making it difficult to diagnose mental health issues alone. Treatment programs seek to provide women with community services that will help them with food, clothing, health care, and educational needs.&lt;ref name="Sydney"/&gt;

===Psychological trauma===
{{One source|section|date=December 2015}}
The mental stress women go through in prison has a toll on them after they are released.&lt;ref name=jksp/&gt; The way they cope with life is different than a woman who has never set foot on a jail cell.&lt;ref name="jksp"/&gt;  Johnson, Kristine A., and Shannon M. Lynch (Journal of Family Violence) discuss the mental traumas women have before they have been incarcerated (state prisons) and the possible causes for their incarceration.&lt;ref name="jksp"/&gt;  On their article the rate women are being detained as the years pass is evaluated through a series of interviews and assessments.&lt;ref name="jksp"/&gt;  Most prisoners suffer from CSA (childhood of sexual abuse).&lt;ref name="jksp"/&gt;  The percentage at which women are being imprisoned is just as high as the amount women suffering from this trauma.&lt;ref name="jksp"/&gt;  Lynch and the others suggest that there might be a link between the number of women being incarcerated and their trauma.&lt;ref name="jksp"/&gt;  In 1999, the Bureau of Justice Affairs suggested that 44% of the women suffered from sexual abuse, 10% under 18.&lt;ref name="jksp"/&gt;  In 2005, 100 females were interviewed, 90% of them suffered from [[interpersonal violence]] (IPV) which can be partner violence, sexual assault, or CSA.&lt;ref name="jksp"/&gt;  These statistics are around the same range or higher as the year's progress.&lt;ref name="jksp"/&gt;

Female offenders have a higher rate of IPV than men and women from a general public.&lt;ref name="jksp"/&gt;  According to Lynch and her colleagues, the likelihood of a woman suffering from their traumas depends solely on the length they carry the memory and self-blame.&lt;ref name="jksp"/&gt;  This article suggests that the cognitive distortion these women have is self-blame of their incidents.&lt;ref name="jksp"/&gt;

===Substance abuse===
According to the December 1999 publication ''Women Offenders'' of the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], in 1998 40% of women in US state prisons said that they were using drugs at the time of committing the crimes that they were convicted of, compared with 32% of men.  Of the women in state prisons in 1998, according to the publication, one third committed their crimes in order to buy drugs.&lt;ref name="Sentencing Project"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in the Criminal Justice System: Briefing Sheets |url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/womenincj_total.pdf |publisher=The Sentencing Project |accessdate=2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6GbXJvfEj?url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/womenincj_total.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-14 |df= }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2004 publication ''Drug Use and Dependence, State and Federal Prisoner'' of the Bureau of Justice Statistics stated that 60% of women in state prison had histories of dependence on drugs.  The 1997 publication ''Substance Abuse and Treatment, State and Federal Prisoner, 1997'' states that 1/5 of female state prisoners with histories of substance abuses and 1/8 of female federal prisoners with histories of substance abuse receive treatment for addiction.&lt;ref name="Sentencing Project" /&gt;

===Sexual abuse===

A large prison found in the Southern part of the United States discovered through a intensive study that 68.4% experienced sexual assault prior to being incarcerated, and 17.2% experienced sexual assault in prison. Three percent of the people in this study have experience a completed rape inside prison.&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0032885508322443&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] figures show that women are at higher risk than men of inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization, and lower risk of staff sexual victimization:

The same study shows that women are less likely than men to be forcibly abused, but more likely to be persuaded. In regard to inmate-on-inmate abuse in prison, males (16%) were more likely than females (6%) to have been victimized 11 or more times, to have been bribed or blackmailed (42% compared to 26%), offered protection (39% compared to 19%), or threatened with harm (48% compared to 30%).  Males were more likely than females to report have multiple perpetrators (25% compared to 11%), and to have incidents initiated by a gang (20% compared to 4%).  Broadly similar ratios applied to jails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/svpjri0809.pdf|title=Sexual Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, 2008–09|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in the Journal of Nervous &amp; Mental Disease found that in Correctional Institution for Women in Rhode Island 48.2% of the inmates met criteria for current PTSD and 20.0% for lifetime PTSD. The study noted that often female inmates suffered a history of sexual abuse or physical abuse in their childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Zlotnick, Caron.

Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. Web. 13 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual offenses against women prisoners can include rape, assault, and groping during pat frisks. Male correctional officials can often violate women prisoners' privacy by watching them undress, shower, and go to the bathroom. Research suggests that "women with histories of abuse are more likely to accept sexual misconduct from prison staff because they are already conditioned to respond to coercion and threats by acquiescing to protect themselves from further violence".&lt;ref name="Resistance Behind Bars"&gt;{{cite book|last=Law|first=Victoria|title=Resistance Behind Bars: The Struggles of Incarcerated Women|year=2009|publisher=PM Press|location=Oakland|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In federal women's correction facilities, 70% of guards are male,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Sherri|title=Working with Women who are Survivors of the United States 'Corrections' Systems: Challenges for Social Service Workers|journal=Lecture at University of Massachusetts, Amherst MA|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  reinforcing female inmates' powerlessness.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

There have been numerous legal cases challenging the conditions of confinement.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  In 2003, President Bush signed the "[[Prison Rape Elimination Act]] into law, legally addressing prisoner rape, calling for a study of [[prison rape in the United States|prison rape]] and developing guidelines for states on how to address the problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Law|first=Victoria|title=Resistance Behind Bars: The Struggles of Incarcerated Women|year=2009|publisher=PM Press|location=Oakland|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, its primary focus was on prisoner-on-prisoner assaults in male prisons,{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} and it failed to mention the sexual abuse in female facilities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}  In 2005, "the Office of the Inspector General and the DOJ released a report documenting widespread sexual abuse by prison employees nationwide, noting that only 37% had faced some kind of legal action. Of those, ¾ walked away with no more than probation. It took all of this evidence for the BOP to finally criminalize sexual contact as a felony in 2006, so that guards can actually face up to five years in prison".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Talvi|first=Silja|title=Women Behind Bars: The Crisis of Women in the U.S. Prison System|year=2007|publisher=Seal Press|location=Emeryville|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, "when authorities confirmed that corrections staff had sexually abused inmates in their care, only 42% of those officers had their cases referred to prosecution; only 23% were arrested, and only 3% charged, indicted, or convicted. Fifteen per cent were actually allowed to keep their jobs".&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2011 1–19"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaiser|first=David|author2=Louisa Stannow|title=Prison Rape and the Government|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=24 March 2011|pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such legislative progress, women are fully dependent on the guards for basic necessities and privileges, and in many states, guards have access to inmates' personal history files which can empower them to threaten prisoners' children if the women retaliate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Prison: A Fact Sheet|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/women/pdf/womeninprison.pdf|publisher=Amnesty International USA|accessdate=2011-04-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625090012/http://www.amnestyusa.org/women/pdf/womeninprison.pdf |archivedate=June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Female inmates who retaliate also face the loss of eligibility for early parole in addition to prolonged periods of disciplinary segregation, and detrimental write-ups, which further deters acts of resistance.&lt;ref name="Kaiser 2011 1–19"/&gt; Many times, sexual abuse cases go unreported so the extent of the issue is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/publications/criminal_justice_magazine_home/crimjust_cjmag_16_1_smith.html|title=American Bar Association - Criminal Justice Section - Criminal Justice Magazine|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fear incited by such threats as well as the concern that no one will believe them or that no one really cares can successfully silence women.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}  Experience of sexual abuse in prison can greatly impede a womans' capacity to reintegrate into society upon release.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Healthcare==
{{POV section|date=September 2014}}
{{anchor|Health care}}
Incarcerated women suffer disproportionately{{discuss}}&lt;!--proportionate to what?--&gt; from [[HIV/AIDS in American prisons|HIV/AIDS]], [[Infectious diseases in American prisons|infectious diseases within prisons]], reproductive issues, and chronic diseases.&lt;ref name="bare_url"/&gt;  Most inmates are women of color from low socioeconomic backgrounds and therefore suffer from both chronic diseases that are common in minorities (such as diabetes, [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], and [[hypertension]]) and health problems that may result from living in poverty (such as [[malnutrition]], etc.).  Transmittable infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and hepatitis C viral can be found at elevated rates in population of incarcerated women than in the community&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Springer|first=Sandra A.|date=January 2010|title=Improving Healthcare for Incarcerated Women|journal=Journal of Women's Health|volume=19|issue=1|pages=13–15|doi=10.1089/jwh.2009.1786|issn=1540-9996|pmc=2828190|pmid=20088653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure and system of the US prison system does not adequately accommodate for these healthcare needs. Since women are not given the proper healthcare once inside prisons, their health tends to keep deteriorating as time progresses.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; Policies regarding health treatment at prison institutions often limit the availability of care. For example, at many institutions women must wait in lines under strenuous conditions until designated times for most medical treatments and medications. Medical treatment oftentimes needs to be requested and approved by correctional officers who have little or no medical training.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; Due to the geographic isolation of prisons and the comparatively low wages offered, there is a lack of qualified and experienced healthcare professionals willing to work in prison, which in turn, reduces the quality of care offered. Overcrowding and poor environmental facilities exacerbate the problem. Studies show that "women's [prison] facilities are typically even more substandard and stressful from an environmental point of view than men's facilities".&lt;!-- [citation needed] --&gt; Other barriers include the lack of research being conducted specific to the needs of [[incarceration of women|incarcerated women]], including but not limited to the cultural and language barriers that women can face when trying to communicate their health issues.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

There are two main reasons that may account for the incompetent provisions regarding the health of women imprisoned in the [[prison-industrial complex]], which are the view of women's prisons being a profiting industry and the change from a [[welfare state]] to a crime control state.&lt;ref name=ccd&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chandler|first=Cynthia|title=Death and Dying in America: The Prison Industrial Complex's Impact on Women's Health|journal=Berkeley Women's Law Journal|date=2003|volume=18|pages=40–61|accessdate=2 May 2014|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1191&amp;context=bglj}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of prisons as a profiting industry for private companies is one of the main causes explaining why the health care system of women in prisons is not fully adequate.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; Women must choose between their freedom and their health since bodies in the [[prison-industrial complex]] are seen as slave labor.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; Women prisoners are the ones who complete the tasks necessary to keep the prisons operating so many are forced to keep working on tasks even if their health is not in good shape.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; For example, in [[California]] women who are categorized as [[Disability|disabled]] outside of prison are forced to work once inside prison since their disabled status is rejected.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; Many of the basic tools to keep good [[hygiene]] such as toothbrushes, shampoo, or soap are not given for free to women anymore but are sold in the [[commissary#other uses|commissaries]] by companies who paid the government the most amount to win over the contracts.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; Many women are unable to afford these products at such inflated prices causing there to be poor conditions inside prisons, which can be harmful to those who are seriously ill, such as those who have HIV.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; They are unable to avoid simple infections that can be avoided with good hygiene which ends up having detrimental effects upon them.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; Also, prisons tend not to spend adequately on the prisoners which has caused many prisons such as those in [[California]] to provide unhealthy meals for the prisoners.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; Meals that have high levels of fat, sugar, and salts have negative effects upon the health of the women.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; Those with illnesses such as diabetes have to forgo a meal since the meals would cause them to worsen.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; Fresh fruit or vegetables are rarely provided or when provided are in small proportions which ends up hurting the health of many since they do not get a well-balanced meal.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; Another reason which may account for the poor health conditions of women in prisons is the notion of the switch from a welfare state to a crime control state.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; Many women are neglected proper treatment; when they voice their complaints, they are often not taken seriously.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; When women are diagnosed, they are sometimes not fully informed, allowing prisons to overlooking providing proper medical attention. Often times with surgical procedures, the women may not be informed of what was performed or the reason why.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; This causes them to not have knowledge about their own health or the treatment options available to them.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; Those women who have addictions are sometimes not given drugs to help them in painful situations such is the case of Trina Brown, a prisoner in Central California's Women's Facility.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; She was neglected pain relievers even when she was in excruciating pain on the basis that she just wanted the medication to feed her former addiction.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; The healthcare provided, or lack of it, to incarcerated women can even be seen as a punishment for these women, contributing to a punitive nature in the healthcare system of these prisons.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; Since the prisons do not have to respond to the treatment of these women they save money which maximizes their profits.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; The maximizing of profits in the prison industrial complex ends up have grave consequences towards the health of many women incarcerated in prisons as well as the change of a welfare state to a crime control state.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt; These medical abuses in the end prohibit women to have control over their own bodies and allows the state to have full control over them.&lt;ref name="ccd"/&gt;

===Reproductive health===
{{Main|Reproductive health care for incarcerated women in the United States}}

In 1994 the [[National Institute of Corrections]] said that American prison systems did not adequately provide  gynecological services. During that year half of the state prison systems surveyed by the institute provided female-specific health care services, including [[mammograms]] and [[pap smears]]. [[Amnesty International]] said that, in the systems offering those services, many women encountered long waiting lists.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Prison: Fact Sheet |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/women/pdf/womeninprison.pdf |publisher=Amnesty International USA |accessdate=2011-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625090012/http://www.amnestyusa.org/women/pdf/womeninprison.pdf |archivedate=June 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of study conducted in a Rhode Island prison indicated high levels of reproductive health risks (STDs, unplanned pregnancies, etc.), from which researchers concluded that providing reproductive health services to incarcerated women would be beneficial to the women, the community, and the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, J. G., Megan R. Hebert, Cynthia Rosengard, Jennifer S. Rose, Kristen M. DaSilva, and Michael D. Stein. [http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2004.060236 "Reproductive Health Care and Family Planning Needs Among Incarcerated Women."] ''American Journal of Public Health'' 96.5 (2006): 834-39. American Journal of Public Health. American Public Health Association. Web. 14 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the American prison system, HIV became more prevalent among women than among men. According to the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], from 1991 to 1998 the number of women prisoners with HIV increased by 69%, while the equivalent figure among male prisoners decreased by 22% during the same time period. The [[New York State Department of Health]] stated in 1999 that women entering New York state prisons had twice as high of an HIV rate as men entering New York state prisons. At the end of the year 2000 women in U.S. state prison systems had a 60% higher likelihood of carrying HIV than men in American state prison systems.&lt;ref name="Resistance Behind Bars 36"&gt;{{cite book|last=Law|first=Victoria|title=Resistance Behind Bars: The Struggles of Incarcerated Women|year=2009|publisher=PM Press|location=Oakland|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=gnzEnCrr2dsC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=%22In+August+2007,+Searight%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TLrzTZf3DYbAtgepwe3qBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22In%20August%202007%2C%20Searight%22&amp;f=false 36]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''HIV in Prison'' by the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], in 2004  2.4% (1 in 42) of women in American prisons had HIV, while 1.7% (1 in 59) of men had HIV.&lt;ref name="Sentencing Project" /&gt;

===Pregnancy and prenatal care in US prisons===
==== Current Treatment of Pregnant Inmates ====
Data from 2010 show that female incarceration rates are growing more rapidly than male incarceration rates in the United States&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tapia|first=Natalia D.|last2=Vaughn|first2=Michael S.|date=2010-10-11|title=Legal Issues Regarding Medical Care for Pregnant Inmates|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0032885510382211|journal=The Prison Journal|language=en|volume=90|issue=4|pages=417–446|doi=10.1177/0032885510382211|issn=0032-8855}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Consequently, one out of every four women in prison is pregnant. Less than half of prisons in the United States have official policies about medical care for pregnant inmates. About 48% of prisons have prenatal services. Of these 48%, only 15% of prisons have programs implemented to help mothers find suitable work after they give birth. Additionally, only 15% of prisons have policies that require light work or no work for pregnant women.  Throughout the United States, pregnant inmates are treated poorly by prison staff because there is a permeating prejudice that pregnant inmates are not "worthy enough to have children"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. There are psychological stressors experienced by pregnant inmates during pregnancy and during the birthing process. For example, thirty-five states allow women to be chained to the bed while in labor and giving birth. In states where shackling is illegal, there are a significant amount of lawsuits claiming that shackling was used during childbirth. Researchers have argued that allowing women to remain shackled to a bed during birth is inhumane and undignified&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

==== Problems with rising pregnancy rates in US prisons ====
Pregnancy among inmates is a challenge.  According to a 2008 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics on female prisoners, 4% of state and 3% of federal inmates said they were pregnant at the time they began their incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;Maruschak, L. M. (2008). [http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=1097 "Medical problems of prisoners."] Bureau of Justice Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is difficult to accurately assess the recurrence due to a lack of reporting requirements and irregular pregnancy testing at admission.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;Clarke, J.G. &amp; Adashi, E. Y. (2011). Perinatal care for incarcerated patients: A 25-year-old woman pregnant in jail. The Journal of the American Medical Association, 305(9), 923–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  The needs of mothers during pregnancy and childbirth often conflict with the demands of the prison system.

In the United States, the prison system was designed to accommodate male inmates.&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B., Owen, B., &amp; Covington, S. (2003). [http://static.nicic.gov/Library/018017.pdf "Gender-responsive strategies: Research, practice, and guiding principles for women offenders."]  National Institute of Corrections, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rising rate of female incarceration poses challenges on a variety of levels, including health care.&lt;ref name="Clarke" /&gt;  It is estimated that 9% of women in prisons give birth while completing their sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, A. N. (2009). Impact of forced separation policy on incarcerated postpartum mothers. Policy, Politics, &amp; Nursing Practice, 10(3), 204–11. DOI: 10.1177/1527154409351592&lt;/ref&gt;  In spite of a Supreme Court ruling [[Estelle v. Gamble]], 1976, which declared entitlement to basic health care for all people who are incarcerated, provision of adequate prenatal care in US prisons has been inconsistent at best.&lt;ref&gt;Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, prisons have the power to hold incarcerated women and limit their contact with the outside world, which can result in women not being able to exercise their reproductive rights, such as getting an abortion. Incarcerated women’s struggle does not end after their incarceration, given that the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act (ASFA), expedites the process of terminating a parent’s rights if her children are in foster care, resulting in many incarcerated women losing the parental rights to their children.[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/173809/pdf]

====Prenatal care====
Women who are in jail or prison often have very high-risk pregnancies due to a higher prevalence of risk factors, which can negatively influence both pregnancy and delivery.  Among these are the mother's own medical history and exposure to [[sexually transmitted infections]], her level of education, mental health, substance use/abuse patterns, poor nutrition, inadequate prenatal care, socio-economic status, and environmental factors, such as violence and toxins.&lt;ref name="Fogel"&gt;Fogel, C. I. (2006). Pregnant inmates: Risk factors and pregnancy outcomes. Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, &amp; Neonatal Nursing, 22(1), 33–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prenatal care]] in prisons is erratic.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fogel"/&gt;  The [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]], the [[National Commission on Correctional Health Care]], the [[American Public Health Association]], the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]], and the [[American Bar Association]] have all outlined minimal standards for pregnancy-related health care in correctional settings, and 34 states have established policies for provision of adequate prenatal care.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Civil Liberties Union. [https://www.aclu.org/maps/state-standards-pregnancy-related-health-care-and-abortion-women-prison-map State standards for pregnancy-related health care and abortion for women in prison—map.]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the services can vary widely,&lt;ref name ="Clarke"/&gt; and there is not a reliable reporting measure to ensure services are delivered.

Prenatal care for incarcerated women is a shared responsibility between medical staff in the prison and community providers, but specific delineation of care is determined locally, depending on available resources and expertise.&lt;ref name="Clarke"/&gt;  Women must often be transported for prenatal care and delivery, which can cause stress for the mother.  In addition, some states continue to use shackles for security during transportation, labor, delivery, and postpartum care.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  The use of shackles is highly controversial, reported as both dangerous and inhumane.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

====Shackles====
{{Main|Use of restraints on pregnant women}}
[[Shackle]]s are typically used for inmates, who demonstrate risk of elopement, harm to self, or harm to others.  Historically, they have also been used with women attending prenatal care appointments, as well as during labor and delivery.  When used during transit, the use of shackles on the ankles and wrists puts a mother at risk of falling, in which case she would be unable to reach out to soften the fall.  In turn, this could put both the mother and the fetus at risk of injury.  Shackles can also interfere with labor and delivery, prohibiting positions and range of motion for the mother, doctors, and nurses.&lt;ref name="ACLU"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union.  [https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/anti-shackling_briefing_paper_stand_alone.pdf ACLU briefing paper: The shackling of pregnant women &amp; girls in U.S. prisons, jails &amp; youth detention centers.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferszt, G. G. (2011). Who will speak for me?: Advocating for pregnant women in prison. Policy, Politics, &amp; Nursing Practice, 12(4), 254–56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following delivery, shackles interfere with a mother's ability to hold and nurse her infant child.  In addition, women feel ashamed and discriminated against when they are shackled in a community hospital.&lt;ref name="ACLU"/&gt;  Eighteen states in the US currently have laws either prohibiting or restricting shackling pregnant prisoners, and ten states prohibit use of shackles by law.{{Clarify|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref name="ACLU"/&gt;  As a result, it is still common practice in some places.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Constitutional Rights of Pregnant Inmates ==
There has been significant strides in maintaining and protecting the constitutional rights of pregnant inmates. For example, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] in the case of ''Nelson v. Correctional Medical Services'' ruled in 2009 that shackling pregnant women to the bed during labor and delivery is unconstitutional. This decision was rendered after twenty-nine-year-old Nelson was taken to a local hospital in 2003 and had her legs shackled to opposite sides of the bed. She was shackled to the bed for several hours while in labor before she was taken to the hospital room. Nelson claimed the shackles caused her intense pain, discomfort, and severe cramps. She also was unable to change positions while in labor, which caused further discomfort. Although she remained the shackles were removed while she was delivering her child, they were immediately put back on post-delivery. Nelson also claimed that after delivering her child, she soiled the bed sheet because she could not get to the bathroom on time due to the shackles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/cases/nelson-v-norris|title=Nelson v. Norris|last=|first=|date=2009|website=ACLU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Eighth circuit contended that shackling women to the bed during labor and delivery violated the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] since shackling during labor and delivery is cruel punishment. This judicial decision also deemed that the officer in charge of presiding over Nelson during her labor and delivery deliberately acted indifferently. As a result, the court ruled that showing indifference during a woman's labor and delivery or inflicting unnecessary pain or discomfort also violates the Eighth Amendment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griggs|first=Claire|date=2011|title=Birthing Barbarism: The Unconstitutionality of Shackling Pregnant Prisoners|url=|journal=American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy the Law|volume=20|pages=247-272|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another important landmark case was Boswell v. Sherburne County. Wanda Boswell was booked in Sherbrune County Jail in Minnesota for driving under the influence of alcohol. A female prison guard, Valerie Lero, found out that Boswell was about six months pregnant, and she was informed by Boswell that her pregnancy had been having some complications. Boswell also provided Lero some information regarding a fainting incident that happened a few days before her arrest. Boswell also told Lero that she had large amounts of vaginal discharge. While in the Sherburne County Jail, Boswell had been taking a shower and noticed she had been bleeding. She immediately informed Lero of the bleeding, and Lero proceeded to give Boswelll sanitary pads. However, Lero showed no sense of urgency or took any sort of initiative to contact professional medical personnel. Lero also did not record any of the health issues Boswell has expressed. In addition, Lero failed to contact Nancy Riecken, the relief jailer, to inform her of Boswell's medical condition.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGurrin|first=Mary Catherine|date=1993|title=Pregnant Inmates' Right to Health Care|url=|journal=New England journal on criminal and civil confinement|volume=20|pages=163-539|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Boswell took matters into her own hands and contacted Riekcken. Boswell wanted to see a doctor immediately due to her abnormal bleeding and severe abdominal cramping. Riecken, despite knowing the extent of Boswell's medical condition, failed to seek medical help because she claimed Boswell could not seek medical attention until she posted bail. This entire time, Boswell was locked in her cell and continuously banged on the wall for help. Riecken, who had taken over at this time, still refused Boswell's requests for medical attention. Hours passed and still no one was contacted to help Boswell. Riecken contacted the chief jailer who instructed Riecken to reach out to the two other counties where Boswell had outstanding warrants. In other words, the prison personnel left Boswell in her cell cramping and bleeding, just waiting for someone to take Boswell off their hands. Finally, a local police officer and trained emergency room technician examined Boswell and told Riecken to immediately call an ambulance. Boswell proceeded to give birth in an ambulance en route to the hospital. Joseph Boswell was born in the hospital but died thirty-four minutes later.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Boswell brought an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. alleging that the prison staff neglected her medical needs. She claimed her constitutional rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment were violated. The court found that both Riecken and Lero knew Boswell was bleeding and had severe cramps, yet failed to take action to reach out to medical professionals. Boswell's "clearly established right to medical care" was evidently violated. The court found Lero and Riecken responsible for this negligence. Under the Eight Amendment, prisons are required to provide adequate medical care.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Care after childbirth==
The structure of US justice systems makes development of maternal attachment nearly impossible.  After the births of their children, many women are returned to the jail or prison, and their infant immediately enters foster or kinship care.&lt;ref&gt;[[Women's Prison Association]], Institute on Women &amp; Criminal Justice. (2009). Mothers, infants and imprisonment: A national look at prison nurseries and community-based alternatives. New York: Women's Prison Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author1=Kowitz Margolies, J.  |author2=Kraft-Stolar, T.|date=2006|url=http://www.correctionalassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/When_Free_Rpt_Feb_2006.pdf|title=When 'free' means losing your mother: The collision of child welfare and the incarceration of women in New York state.  A report of the Women in Prison Project of the Correctional Association of New York.|publisher=Women in Prison Project, Correctional Association of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, within many state policies, relatives are given less financial support, which can leave foster care to be more viable than kinship placement.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B., Owen, B., &amp; Covington, S. (2003). [http://static.nicic.gov/Library/018017.pdf "Gender-responsive strategies: Research, practice, and guiding principles for women offenders."] National Institute of Corrections, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;  "For 50% of all incarcerated mothers, this separation becomes a lifelong sentence of permanent separation between mothers and their children."&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, A. N. (2009). Impact of forced separation policy on incarcerated postpartum mothers. Policy, Politics, &amp; Nursing Practice, 10(3), 204–11, direct quotation from p. 204. DOI: 10.1177/1527154409351592&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prisons have nurseries for the mother and child.  Women are only eligible to participate in a [[prison nursery]] if they are convicted of non-violent crimes and do not have a history of child abuse or neglect.  Prison nurseries vary widely, but they provide an opportunity to [[breastfeed]] during a sensitive stage in development.  They also provide time for a [[attachment theory|maternal attachment]] to be formed.  Rates of [[recidivism]] are less for women who participated in prison nursery programs.&lt;ref&gt;Goshin, L. S. &amp; Byrne, M. W. (2009). Converging streams of opportunity for prison nursery programs in the United States. Journal of Offender Rehabilitation, 48(4), 271–95. DOI:10.1080/10509670902848972&lt;/ref&gt;

An improvement from the alternative, prison nurseries still leave many gaps in care.  "Reports from mothers with children in prison nurseries indicate that their babies' close proximity allows prison staff to coerce and manipulate a mother by threatening to deny her access to her baby".&lt;ref&gt;The Rebecca Project for Human Rights and The National Women's Law Center. (2010). [http://www.rebeccaproject.org/images/stories/files/mothersbehindbarsreport-2010.pdf Mothers Behind Bars: A state-by-state report card and analysis of federal policies on conditions of confinement for pregnant and parenting women and the effect on their children.] Direct quotation from p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some advocacy groups argue for alternative sentencing, such as family-based treatment centers, where mothers convicted of non-violent crimes can learn parenting skills while receiving services and support to foster positive child development and build a foundation to re-enter society following her term with decreased risk for future incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;The Rebecca Project for Human Rights and The National Women's Law Center. (2010). [http://www.rebeccaproject.org/images/stories/files/mothersbehindbarsreport-2010.pdf Mothers Behind Bars: A state-by-state report card and analysis of federal policies on conditions of confinement for pregnant and parenting women and the effect on their children.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abortion while incarcerated==
Women have undergone [[forced sterilization]] which prohibits them from having children later in life.&lt;ref  name="rrd"/&gt; Other women in prison have not been given the option of having an abortion, although they may desire one.&lt;ref  name="rrd"/&gt; Even though there are women who can afford to pay for their own abortion, they still may not be allowed to have one because of being incarcerated.&lt;ref  name="rrd"/&gt; In some cases abortions may be allowed but some women may not be able to afford it, therefore ending the option of choice, as the government will not pay.&lt;ref  name="rrd"/&gt; These situations force women to have unwanted children and then they must find someone to keep their child until they are no longer incarcerated.&lt;ref  name="rrd"/&gt;

Prison can have an effect on [[Relationships for incarcerated individuals|relationships between prisoners and their children]]. As a general rule, except for with an experimental trial, a couple cannot enter the same prison. However, prisons have a problem with child care. 2.4 million American children have a parent behind bars today. Seven million, or 1 in 10 children, have a parent under criminal justice supervision—in jail or prison, on probation, or on parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Solinger|first=Rickie|title=Interrupted Life:Experiences of Incarcerated Women in the United States|year=2010|publisher=University of California|location=Berkely, CA.|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the women incarcerated are single mothers who are subsequently characterized as inadequate, incompetent, and unable to provide for their children during and after imprisonment. However, "separation from and concern about the well-being of their children are among the most damaging aspects of prison for women, and the problem is exacerbated by a lack of contact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Travis|first=Jeremy|title=Prisoners Once Removed: The Impact of Incarceration and Reentry on Children, Families and Communities|year=2003|publisher=The Urban Institute Press|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, "54% of mothers in state prisons as of 2000 had had no personal visits with their children since their admission".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Travis|first=Jeremy|title=Prisoners Once Removed: The Impact of Incarceration and Reentry on Children, Families and Communities|year=2003|publisher=The Urban Institute Press|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obstacles that inhibit contact between mothers and their children include geographical distance, lack of transportation, lack of privacy, inability to cover travel expenses, and the inappropriate environments of correctional facilities. Mothers in prison typically are unable to fulfill the role of mother due to the separation. Incarcerated mothers are restricted in their decision-making power and their ability to create a sense of home and family within the institution is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Luther, Kate, and Joanna Gregson. "Restricted Motherhood: Parenting in a Prison Nursery."International Journal of Sociology of the Family 37.1 (2011): 85-104. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Most children experience multiple risks across contextual levels for there is great importance in family environments. Children of incarcerated mothers are consistent with their high risk status and it can cause their intellectual outcomes to be compromised.&lt;ref&gt;Poehlmann, Julie. "Children's Family Environments And Intellectual Outcomes During Maternal Incarceration." Journal of Marriage &amp; Family 67.5 (2005): 1275-1285.Women's Studies International. Web. 16 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics indicate "that a majority of parents in state and federal prisons are held over 100 miles from their prior residence; in federal prison 43% of parents are held 500 miles away from their last home, and over half of female prisoners have never had a visit from their children and very few mothers speak with their children by phone while incarcerated".&lt;ref name="Sentencing Project" /&gt;

Recent legislation has further impeded an incarcerated mother's ability to sustain custody of her children. The [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]], enacted in 1997, "authorizes the termination of parental rights once a child has been in foster care for 15 or more months of a 22-month period. Incarcerated women serve an average of 18 months in prison. Therefore, the average female prisoner whose children are placed in foster care could lose the right to reunite with her children upon release".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Travis|first=Jeremy|title=Prisoners Once Removed: The Impact of Incarceration and Reentry on Children, Families and Communities|year=2003|publisher=The Urban Institute Press|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;    These stipulations expedite the termination of parental rights due to the narrow time frame. A 2003 study found that "termination proceedings involving incarcerated parents increased from approximately 260 in 1997, the year of ASFA's enactment, to 909 in 2002".&lt;ref name="Law 2009 45"&gt;{{cite book|last=Law|first=Victoria|title=Resistance Behind Bars: The Struggles of Incarcerated Women|year=2009|publisher=PM Press|location=Oakland|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
By examining post-incarcerated mothers, it is statistically and clinically proven that there is a positive effect of a healthy mother-child relationship and depression symptoms. There is also a positive effect of healthy peer and partner relationships on raising self-esteem for mothers who were previously incarcerated. This suggests that healthy relationships are essential to recovery from trauma and emotional well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Walker | first1 = Erin K. | title = Risk and protective factors in mothers with a history of incarceration: do relationships buffer the effects of trauma symptoms and substance abuse history? | journal = [[Women &amp; Therapy]] | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 359–376 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/02703149.2011.591662 | date = 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02703149.2011.591662 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2000 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, "1/3 of incarcerated mothers lived alone with their children and over 2/3 of women prisoners have children under the age of 18; among them only 28% said that their children were living with the father while 90% of male prisoners with minor children said their children were living with their mothers."&lt;ref name="Law 2009 45"/&gt;

When the paternal figure of a home is convicted, children are affected, but they don't experience the same kind of attachment disparity as they do with their mothers. "When fathers go to prison, their children are more likely to remain in the care of their mothers; however, when mothers go to prison, not only are children separated from their mother but they more often transition to the care of a grandparent, or other family member, than to the care of their other parent ".&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dallaire|first1=D.

Children who grow up without their parents tend to have a higher chance of engaging in "substance abuse and addiction, mental illness, and abusive familial relationships".&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

There are limited employment opportunities after incarceration.&lt;ref name="gjyc"/&gt; Reduced opportunities for parents means reduced opportunities for their children who cannot access those resources denied to their parents, such as food stamps or employment.&lt;ref name="gjyc"/&gt; In addition, for communities where the majority of the population are targets for incarceration and where there are high incarceration rates, those economies are affected.&lt;ref name="gjyc"/&gt; In addition to poor economies, limited employment opportunities, and high incarceration rates in those communities, there is the creation of a "criminogenic environment" which affects the children growing up in those areas.&lt;ref name="gjyc"/&gt;

Women in the US criminal justice system are marginalized by race and class. Single mothers with low income go into the "underground economies" because of their inability to find a job that is stable and provides a good earning.&lt;ref name=kgmw&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirk|first=Gwyn|author2=Margo Okazawa-Rey |title=Women's lives: Multicultural perspectives|journal=Mayfield Pub.|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many mothers end up trapped in drugs, prostitution and theft.&lt;ref name="kgmw"/&gt; In many cases, incarcerated women who committed acts of violence are for self-defense against their abusive partners.&lt;ref name="kgmw"/&gt;

Most prisons do not have public transport, restrictive policies governing visits and phone calls.

==Demographics of incarcerated parents and their children==
The most common age range for incarcerated parents is from age 25 to 35, followed by age 35 to 44 and age 24 and younger.&lt;ref name="gjyc"/&gt;  In mid-2007, 809,800 prisoners in the US prison system were parents to children 18 years of age or younger.&lt;ref name="gjyc"/&gt;  Of those prisoners, 744,200 were fathers and 65,600 were mothers.&lt;ref name="gjyc"/&gt;  In comparison to 1991, this data shows the number of women in prison has more than doubled and the number of fathers incarcerated has increased by seventy-seven percent.&lt;ref name="gjyc"/&gt;  According to studies by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1,706,600 children had at least one incarcerated parent in 2007.&lt;ref name="gjyc"/&gt;

===Children of incarcerated parents===
:see also [[Relationships for incarcerated individuals#Children of incarcerated parents]]
The most common age range for children with at least one incarcerated parent is from 0–9 years old, followed by children from 10 to 17 years old.&lt;ref name="gjyc"/&gt;  In terms of racial demographics of children with incarcerated parents,  Latino children are three times more likely to have a parent in prison in comparison to white children.&lt;ref name="gjyc"/&gt;  Black children are about eight times more likely to have a parent in prison in comparison to white children.&lt;ref name="gjyc"/&gt;  Nearly half of the children with an incarcerated father are Black children.&lt;ref name="gjyc"/&gt;  This is data that has been published in scholarly and peer-reviewed articles, but as the article "Children of Color and Parental Incarceration: Implications for Research, Theory, and Practice" states, "these data among racial minorities must be carefully interpreted because higher numbers may be a reflection of larger societal issues (such as relative degree of involvement in crime, disparate law enforcement practices, sentencing parole policies and practices and biased decision making... rather than a problem among certain groups."&lt;ref name="gjyc"/&gt;

==Barriers to reentry to society==
Of women in US state prisons, 44% do not have a high school diploma or equivalent ([[GED]]).&lt;ref name="Sentencing Project" /&gt;  As they reenter their communities, former inmates confront sparse job opportunities, limited options for stable and affordable housing, denials of public assistance, as well as the challenge of re-establishing relationships with family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Talvi|first=Silja|title=Women Behind Bars: The Crisis of Women in the U.S. Prison System|year=2007|publisher=Seal Press|location=Emeryville|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, relationships, in particular among family, provide an extremely beneficial support system for prisoners returning home upon their release.  Difficulties with employment, housing, and ostracism can decrease successful transitions and lead to [[Recidivism|a cycle in and out of prison]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Some concerns that are faced by policy-makers and correction officials about women re-entering into the community after prison are motherhood and the struggle with substance abuse and mental health issues.
 
Scholars have found that women face negative perceptions such as being seen as inadequate and unable to provide a stable, loving home for their children when they are transitioning back from prison into motherhood.  This separation of children from their mothers is harmful to both the child and mother and this is the main reason for stress inside of women prisons.  For many women getting out of prison, the only aspect of life they consider to be motivating and hopeful is resuming motherhood and connecting with their children again. Without their children, many see no reason to stay away from drugs or prostitution.  Women in these circumstances are understood to have a better life if they are offered proper nutritional and medical care so they could lead a more stable lifestyle.&lt;ref name="The Urban Institute Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Travis|first1=Jeremy|title=Prisoners Once Removed: The Impact of Incarceration and Reentry of Children, Families, and Communities|date=2003|publisher=The Urban Institute Press|pages=76–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle of addiction whether it be alcohol or drug abuse along with mental health issues are considered the three major factors that influence the success of women's transition back into the community.  Women tend to take out their anger on themselves and in a self-mutilating or abusive way.  Mood disorders, such as depression or anxiety, are seen to be more common among women than men.  A study from 1990 found that 19 percent of women who suffer from depression, 31 percent of women who suffer from phobic disorders, and 7 percent of women that suffer from panic disorder also struggled with alcohol abuse.  Women who have been released from prison face the struggle against addiction and could end up losing their children because of it.&lt;ref name="The Urban Institute Press"/&gt;

In order for women to successfully transition back into society, they must begin this preparation process at the beginning of their sentence.  Although this is recommended, inmates tend to not have any preparation before being placed back into the community.  All of the released women have tasks they must complete in order to re-establish a place in society and in order to stay out of trouble.  These are things such as, follow parole regulations, provide health care for themselves and/or their families, become financially stable, obtain employment, and find a safe place to live, all while possibly battling addiction.  Without support from the community, women under these circumstances tend to fall back into drugs or criminal activity.&lt;ref name="The Urban Institute Press"/&gt;

==Women prison organizations==
There are programs that have been established to help women after they are released from prison.&lt;ref name=jksp&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Kristine A.|author2=Shannon M. Lynch|title=Predictors of maladaptive coping in incarcerated women who are survivors of childhood sexual abuse|journal=Family Violence|date=19 March 2014|volume=28|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

System organizations that are used to help women's reentry into the community consist of mental health, alcohol and drug programs, programs to help survivors and sexual violence, family services, food shelters, financial help programs, employment services, child care services, and community service clubs.

A continuity-of-care approach is taken when forming these programs for women. This is the providing of treatment, recovery, and support services throughout the entire process of reentry for women.

Programs: 
* Helping Women Recover: Program designed for treating substance abuse. This focuses on issues such as self-esteem, parenting, relationships, and spirituality. The program addresses these issues using discussion, activities, and exercises.
* Beyond Trauma: A Healing Journey for Women: This is 11 sessions long and teaches women what trauma is, and how it affects their thoughts and feelings as well as their behavior and relationships. The work is done on coping skills using exercises and videos. 
* The Sanctuary Model: This program addresses the issues of mental health, trauma, and substance abuse. This focuses on safety and grieving to build individual empowerment. 
* Seeking Safety: Program for women that have substance dependence and also PTSD. This focuses on five key elements: safety, treatment of PTSD and substance abuse, ideals, behavioral and interpersonal therapies, and therapist processes. 
* The Addiction and Trauma Recovery Integration Model (ATRIUM): psycho-educational 12-week-long program. This is designed to intervene on levels of the body, mind and spirit. 
* The Trauma Recovery and Empowerment Model (TREM): psycho-educational group that includes survival empowerment, self-soothing, and problem solving. This last 33 sessions over nine months.

These programs help women to not feel depressed or overwhelmed by the community once they are allowed to reenter them. There are two agencies that help these women as well, more well known as a settlement house.

* Our Place: This is located in Washington D.C. and focuses mainly on family reunification. This helps women reunite with family, and find housing and employment. This program helps women find the help needed whether it be mental help or substance abuse treatment. 
* The Refugee Model: The Catholic Church works to assist the parolees and support their transitioning. This helps to make the women feel like someone is looking after them and encouraging them as they work to reenter the community. System organizations that are used to help women's reentry into the community consist of mental health, alcohol and drug programs, programs to help survivors and sexual violence, family services, food shelters, financial help programs, employment services, child care services, and community service clubs.

A continuity-of-care approach is taken when forming these programs for women. This is the providing of treatment, recovery, and support services throughout the entire process of reentry for women.&lt;ref name="The Urban Institute Press"/&gt;

== Media portrayal ==
Despite all the things that incarcerated women endure prior to, during, and after their imprisonment, people often have a certain mindset regarding who they are. This is as a result of the inaccuracy the media uses to portray women who are detained; perpetuating the idea that there is nothing more to them than violence and sexual tension. The media's tendency to highlight the aspects of prison life that they deem suitable or entertaining for viewers really serves to belittle and shed attention away from the real issues that incarceration has on the women living their 'truth'. The way that these women are portrayed in the media is crucial to our understanding of their struggles and our ability to empathize with the traumatic experience that is serving time in prison. Instead, they are portrayed with a 'babes behind bars' theme.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cecil | first1 = Dawn K | year = 2007 | title = Looking beyond caged heat: Media images of women in prison | url = | journal = Feminist Criminology | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 304–326 | doi=10.1177/1557085107306142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films such as ''[[The Big Doll House]]'' (1971), ''[[The Big Bird Cage]]'' (1972) and ''[[Caged Heat]]'' (1974) are examples of movies that depict these women as sex-crazed and distort our knowledge from the more universal and serious issues that come with being incarcerated. Because we live in a patriarchal society, women are viewed as objects for intercourse, and their issues are not taken as severely as we would that of males. 

{{quote|Very little factual representation is contained in these films. It is Hollywood, after all; they do not necessarily seek to educate—instead they aim to titillate: 

These tales of vulnerable young things navigating a harsh prison are largely vehicles for money shot–style images that are the films' raison d'être: a roomful of women being hosed down by their sadistic warden as punishment (1971's Big Doll House) . . . or a young reform-school inmate gang-raped with a plunger by her roommates (1974's Born Innocent)".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;}}

'''Kurdish [[mythology]]''' is the collective term for the beliefs and practices of the culturally, ethnically or linguistically related group of ancient peoples who inhabited the [[Kurdistan]] mountains of northwestern [[Zagros]], northern [[Mesopotamia]] and southeastern [[Anatolia]]. This includes their [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] pagan religion prior to them converting to [[Islam]], as well the local myths, legends and [[folklore]] that they produced after becoming [[Muslims]].

==Before Islam==
{{Indo-European topics}}
===Traditional beliefs===
{{Further|Proto-Indo-Iranian religion}}
Kurdish people originally worshipped a [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] or class of gods called ''dêw'', which are known as [[Daeva]] in English, although these gods were later seen as evil monsters, trolls or giants.{{Fact|date=November 2018}} They were replaced by the ''ahurâ'' gods, known in English as [[Asura]], before they were merged into [[Ahura Mazda]]. The Kurds believed in a terrifying dragon that they called ''ejdîha'', which is known as [[Zahhak]] in English.

===Origin story===
{{Main|Origin of the Kurds}}
In Kurdish mythology, the ancestors of the Kurds fled to the mountains to escape the oppression of a king named [[Zahhak]]. It is believed that these people, like [[Kaveh the Blacksmith]] who hid in the mountains over the course of history created a [[kurdish people|Kurdish]] ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=No Friends but the Mountains: The Tragic History of the Kurds |year=1993 |author=John Bulloch, Harvey Morris |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=November 2015}} Mountains, to this day, are still important geographical and symbolic figures in Kurdish life. In common with other national myths, Kurdish mythology is used for political aims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Between the map and the reality : some fundamental myths of Kurdish nationalism|last = O'SHEA M.

==After Islamification==
The Sasanian king [[Khosrow II|Chosroes II Parvez]]  is highly esteemed in the '''Kurdish''' oral tradition, literature and '''mythology'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.proquest.com/openview/b7a6d20dd731bbe2c69a6e6b9dc39fca/1?pq-origsite=gscholar|title = Kurdish Library - Kurdish Museum|last = |first = |date = Summer 1991|work = |access-date = |via = |pages = 117–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Los Angeles Country Club''' is a golf and [[country club]] in the [[Western United States]], located in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

==History==
In the fall of 1897, a group of Los Angeles residents organized the '''Los Angeles Golf Club,''' and a {{convert|16|acre|adj=on}} lot was leased at the corner of Pico and Alvarado streets (now part of the [[Alvarado Terrace Historic District]]) for a nine-hole [[golf course]]. Called "The Windmill Links," the course was named for a makeshift [[Country club|clubhouse]] crafted from the bottom of an abandoned [[windmill]]. Through the middle of 1898, this site served as the club's home until the course became too crowded. The club was removed to [[Pico-Union, Los Angeles|Pico Heights]], at Hobart and 16th streets. The new home was named "The Convent Links" for its location behind a [[convent]] near [[Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery|Rosedale Cemetery]]. Again, nine holes were laid out for play, but by the spring of 1899, this course and clubhouse had also become too restricted for play.

The search committee for a new site, consisting of the club founders [[Joseph Francis Sartori|Joe Sartori]] and Ed Tufts, found the club's new home just {{convert|0.2|mi|m|-2}} west, on the northeast corner of Pico and Western. The [[country club|clubhouse]] was transported intact to a new site in Beverly Hills, and it was expanded there. The club also laid out an 18-hole course. The club reopened on May 30, 1911. It now has 36 holes of golf and tennis courts. The original golf course was laid out by Joe Sartori, Ed Tufts, [[Norman Macbeth]], and Charles Orr. Later, the courses were redesigned by [[William Herbert Fowler|Herbert Fowler]] and [[George C. Thomas, Jr.]], and again by Thomas with William P. Bell in 1927-28.  In 1996 and 1997 an extensive renovation of the north and south courses was completed. In February 2010, an [https://www.thelacc.org/files/NorthCourse_Commemorative_Edition.pdf extensive restoration] of the North Course by Gil Hanse and Thomas biographer Geoff Shackelford took place to return the course to [[George C.

{{History of Iran}}
The '''Masmughans of Damavand''' ([[Middle Persian]]: Masmughan-i Dumbawand, [[Persian language|New Persian]]: مس مغان دماوند, meaning ''Great Magians of Damavand'') were a local dynasty, which ruled [[Mount Damavand|Damavand]] and its surrounding areas from ca. 651 to 760. The founder of the dynasty was a [[House of Karen|Karenid]]&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), pp. 253&lt;/ref&gt; named [[Mardanshah of Damavand]].

== History ==
The Masmughans of Damavand are first mentioned by [[Al-Tabari]], where the [[Masmughan]] [[Mardanshah of Damavand]] reportedly aided the [[House of Mihran|Mihranid]] Siyavakhsh at [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] against the Arabs. The forces of Siyavakhsh and Mardanshah, were, however, defeated. Mardanshah then made peace with the Arabs in return for an annual tribute.&lt;ref&gt;"Maṣmug̲h̲an." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. Brill Online, 2013. Reference. 30 November 2013 &lt;http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/masmughan-COM_0702&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 748/749, [[Abu Muslim]] sought to subdue the Masmughan but his general Musa ibn Kab was ambushed by the local forces who enjoyed the advantage of the terrain, which forced him to return to [[Ray, Iran|Ray]]. In 758/759 due to disputes between Abarwiz and his brother, who is simply called ''Masmughan'' in Arabic sources, Abarwiz then went over to the [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]] who gave him a pension. In some Arabic sources Abarwiz is called Al-Masmughan Malik (''[[malik]] of the [[Masmughan]]s''), and is known for his bravery.

In 760, Masmughan, the brother of Abarwiz, was at war against his father-in-law, the [[Dabuyid]] [[ispahbadh]] [[Khurshid of Tabaristan|Khurshid]], but when he heard about the Abbasid expedition to [[Tabaristan]], he made peace with the latter. The Arabs then defeated the [[ispahbadh]] and the Masmughan, who was captured along with his daughters Bakhtariya and Shakla. One of these daughters became the wife of [[Al-Mahdi]].

'''Menshen'''&lt;!--Chinese in infobox--&gt; or '''door gods'''{{sfnp|Clart|2008|p=744}} are divine guardians of doors and gates in [[Chinese folk religion]]s, used to protect against evil influences or to encourage the entrance of positive ones. They began as the divine pair [[Shenshu (deity)|Shenshu]] ({{zh|神荼}}) and [[Yulü]] ({{zh|鬱壘}}) under the [[Han dynasty|Han]], but the [[apotheosis|deified]] generals [[Qin Shubao]] ({{zh|秦叔寶}}) and [[Yuchi Gong]] ({{zh|尉迟恭}}) have been more popular since the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]]. In cases where a door god is affixed to a single door, [[Wei Zheng]] or [[Zhong Kui]] is commonly used.

==History==
The gates and doors of [[Chinese architecture|Chinese house]]s have long received special ritual attention.{{sfnp|Clart|2008|p=744}} Sacrifices to a door spirit are recorded as early as the ''[[Book of Rites]]''.{{sfnp|Clart|2008|p=744}}&lt;ref name=leggy&gt;{{citation |editor-last=Legge |date=1885 |title=Book of Rites, ''Vol. II'' |p=207 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Han dynasty|Han]], this spirit had become the two gods [[Shenshu (deity)|Shenshu]] and [[Yulü]], whose names or images were painted into [[peachwood]] and attached to doors.{{sfnp|Clart|2008|p=744}} The [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Great Ancestor]] of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] ("Emperor Taizong") ordered portraits of his generals [[Qin Shubao]] and [[Yuchi Gong]] to be affixed to gates.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} They eventually [[apotheosis|came to be considered divine protectors]], replacing Shentu and Yulü and remaining the most common door gods to the present day.{{sfnp|Clart|2008|p=744}} Qin and Yuchi, along with various other [[apotheosis|deified]] military leaders, make up a class of {{nowrap|'''martial door gods'''}} intended to ward off evil spirits and bad influences. A separate group of scholars make up a class of {{nowrap|'''civil door gods'''}} intended to attract blessings and good fortune.{{sfnp|Clart|2008|p=744}} Some deities are also thought to have guardians who serve a similar role at their temples, such as [[Lin Moniang|Mazu]]'s companions [[Qianliyan]] and [[Shunfeng'er]].

==Legends==
The 10th chapter of the [[Four Classic Novels|Chinese novel]] ''[[Journey to the West]]'' includes an account of the origin of door gods. In it, the [[Dragon King]] of the [[Jing River]] disguised himself as a human to outsmart the fortune teller Yuan Shoucheng. Since he was able to control the weather, he made a bet with Yuan about [[Chang'an]]'s forecast for the next day. He was nonplussed, however, when he received an order from the [[Jade Emperor]] telling him to give the city precisely the weather Yuan had predicted. The Dragon King preferred to win the bet and disregarded the order, going to Yuan to gloat the next day. Yuan remained calm and revealed that he had known the Dragon King's identity all along. Moreover, since the dragon had been so arrogant as to disregard an order from the Jade Emperor, his doom would be short in coming. The dragon was shocked to see his disobedience known and immediately pleaded with Yuan to save him. Yuan let him know that the Jade Emperor would send [[Wei Zheng]]—a senior minister from the court of the [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Great Ancestor]] of the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] ("Emperor Taizong")—to execute him at noon the following day. He told him his best course of action was to ask Taizong for help and, taking pity on the Dragon King, the emperor agreed to save him. In order to do so, the emperor summoned Wei Zheng to play [[go (game)|go]] with him in the morning. He endeavored to keep Wei from leaving until after noon, preventing him from carrying out the Jade Emperor's order, and was delighted when Wei grew so tired with the long game that he fell asleep. A little while later, however, the Great Ancestor was told that a dragon's head had fallen from the sky. Wei awoke and told him that his spirit had left his body during his nap and gone to [[Tian|Heaven]] to carry out the Jade Emperor's order. The annoyed spirit of the Dragon King then haunted the Great Ancestor each night until his generals [[Qin Shubao]] and [[Yuchi Gong]] volunteered to stand guard at his door. The emperor enjoyed his peaceful sleep but did not want to continue bothering his two generals. In their place, he had artists paint their portraits and paste them to the doors. This was then copied by his subjects.&lt;ref name=jttw&gt;{{citation |title=The Journey to the West |at=Ch. 10 |url=http://down02.putclub.com/virtual/backup/update/Download/Literature/The_Journey_To_The_West_Wu_Cheng_en.pdf |last=Wu |first=Cheng'en |authormask=[[Wu Cheng'en]] }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
In modern use, door gods are usually printed images which are pasted to paired doors. They are usually replaced every [[Chinese New Year]].{{sfnp|Clart|2008|p=744}} Occasionally, they are sculpted in relief or placed as statues to either side of a door. The figures should face each other; it is considered bad luck to place them back to back.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Worship==
In ancient China, there was a ritual for a sacrifice to the door spirit of a wealthy home recorded in the ''[[Book of Rites]]''.&lt;ref name=leggy/&gt; In modern China, door gods do not make up a formal element of [[Taoism in China|Taoism]] and are included as traditional decorations or as nods to [[Chinese folk religion|popular superstition]].{{sfnp|Clart|2008|p=744}} There are, however, some deities worshipped for other reasons—including the [[Azure Dragon]],{{sfnp|Clart|2008|p=745}} the [[White Tiger (China)|White Tiger]],{{sfnp|Clart|2008|p=745}} and [[Lin Moniang|Mazu]]'s companions [[Qianliyan]] and [[Shunfeng'er]]—who also serve as door gods at Taoist temples.{{sfnp|Clart|2008|p=745}}

==Whiteness History Month==
At [[Portland Community College]] (PCC)'s Whiteness History Month in April 2016, Strickland attended several events to produce film for his YouTube channel LaughingAtLiberals. A PCC spokeswoman said he was routinely "pushing buttons" and posting heavily edited videos about the events.&lt;ref name="theen13"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2016/07/portland_colleges_ban_man_char.html|title=Portland colleges ban man charged with waving gun at Don't Shoot PDX march|last=Theen|first=Andrew|date=13 July 2016|work=[[OregonLive.com]]|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law enforcement say that Strickland has a past police report alleging "possibly race-based threats" against an attendee at a Portland vigil for the victims of last month's nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2016/07/man_accused_of_pulling_gun_on.html|title=Man accused of pulling gun on Portland protesters was armed with multiple magazines of ammo, prosecutor says|work=OregonLive.com|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strickland, who also participated in Portland State University's PSU for Trump group, was alleged to have participated in online harassment campaigns against lesbian and transgender students and also filmed and mocked students and activists along with PSU for Trump members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whoismichaelstrickland.com/|title=Michael Strickland {{!}} Michael Strickland of Portland is a white supremacist|website=whoismichaelstrickland.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=LaughingAtLiberals|title=Raw, Uncut: Wackjob Students Takeover PSU Board Meeting|date=2016-06-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He1lNosT6-E|accessdate=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=LaughingAtLiberals|title=Triggliots Lose Their Minds At Trump Event|date=2016-06-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiADgGSGHiM|accessdate=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thinkprogress.org/how-students-for-trump-terrorized-portland-state-university-88396c06c743/|title=How ‘Students for Trump’ terrorized Portland State University|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Don't Shoot Portland rally gun incident==
At a [[Black Lives Matter]] rally in Portland, Oregon, on 7 July 2016, Strickland pulled a [[Glock#9×19mm Parabellum|Glock 26]] pistol and pointed it at protesters, including an undercover police officer. Portland police reported that Strickland's pistol was equipped with "an extremely large magazine" (over 120 rounds in multiple magazines) and had a round in the chamber.&lt;ref name="koin13"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://koin.com/2017/02/12/man-who-pulled-gun-on-crowd-guilty/|title=Man who pulled gun on crowd guilty|last=Weisberg|first=Brent|date=12 February 2017|work=[[KOIN]]|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pdxtribune07"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/314304-193157-man-with-gun-arrested-at-downtown-rally-protesting-recent-police-shootings|title=Gun arrest mars peaceful Don't Shoot Portland rally|date=7 July 2016|work=[[Portland Tribune]]|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police also reported Strickland was carrying five extra magazines for the pistol, all loaded.&lt;ref name="pdxtribune07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="opb08"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.opb.org/news/article/gun-pulled-black-lives-matter-portland-charges-michael-strickland/|title=Man Accused Of Pulling Gun At Portland Black Lives Matter Protest Appears In Court | last=Templeton|first=Amelia|date=8 July 2016|work=[[Oregon Public Broadcasting]]|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strickland claims he was surrounded by several [[Anarchy|anarchist]] protesters who pushed and shoved him, and that he feared for his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kptv.com/story/32398549/man-who-displayed-gun-at-downtown-portland-protest-arrested|title=Man who displayed gun at downtown Portland protest arrested|date=7 July 2016|work=[[KPTV]] Fox 12|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="olive_07" /&gt;

Portland's police chief, Mike Marshman, said Strickland's actions at the rally were "fully unacceptable", stating, "I'm very, very proud of the members of the Police Bureau who cautiously and safely enabled the protest to continue on. That's how it should be. To the men and women of the Police Bureau, please continue to do what you do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2016/07/portland_mayor_police_chief_st.html | title=Portland mayor, police chief stand with faith leaders to deplore recent violence | last=Bernstein|first=Maxine|date=8 July 2016|work=[[OregonLive.com]]|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portland police arrested Strickland at the scene, charging him with [[menacing]] and [[disorderly conduct]], both misdemeanors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://katu.com/news/local/dozens-gather-for-blacklivesmatter-protest-in-portland|title=Dozens gather for #BlackLivesMatter protest in Portland|date=7 July 2016|work=[[KATU]]|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement officials then processed Strickland through the Multnomah County Detention Center and released Strickland on his own recognizance.&lt;ref name="olive_07"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2016/07/dont_shoot_pdx_protesting_poli.html|title=Man pulls gun at Don't Shoot PDX protesting US police shootings|last=Ryan|first=Jim|date=7 July 2016|work=[[OregonLive.com]]|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day the state added two additional charges of unlawful use of a firearm, a class C felony.&lt;ref name="fontana_08"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2016/07/man_who_pulled_gun_at_dont_sho.html#incart_2box |title=Man accused of pulling gun at Don't Shoot PDX rally released from jail|last=Fontana|first=Francesca|date=19 July 2016|work=[[OregonLive.com]]|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Strickland's arraignment, the judge set [[bail]] at $250,000, with Strickland being released after posting the required bail on July 18. A [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]] district attorney sought the high bail amount partly based on alleged race-based threats, including harassing texts and phone calls, reportedly made by Strickland at a previous [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]] vigil.&lt;ref name="opb08" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2016/07/man_accused_of_pulling_gun_on.html|title=Man accused of pulling gun on Portland protesters was armed with multiple magazines of ammo, prosecutor says|last=Bernstein|first=Maxine|date=8 July 2016|work=[[OregonLive.com]]|accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the incident and based on his activities on campuses, [[Portland State University]] banned Strickland from its campus for two years, and Portland Community College indefinitely banned Strickland from its campus.&lt;ref name="theen13" /&gt;

On February 10, 2017, Strickland was found guilty of all 21 counts: 10 counts of unlawful use of a weapon, 10 counts of menacing, and one count of disorderly conduct. He was sentenced to 40 days in jail, 240 hours of community service, banned from taking video of people or events for at least 2017, and is also banned from owning guns.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kxl.com/no-prison-journalist-displays-gun-protest/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://katu.com/news/local/man-who-pointed-pistol-at-protesters-banned-from-owning-guns&lt;/ref&gt; During the hearing the court discussed finding in a pre-sentence investigation that Strickland had Autistic tendencies or Aspergers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kxl.com/no-prison-journalist-displays-gun-protest/|title=No Prison For Journalist Who Displays Gun During A Protest - KXL|date=2017-05-03|work=KXL|access-date=2017-09-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Miryang gang rape''', known in [[South Korea]] as the '''Miryang middle school girls rape incident''', was a criminal incident that occurred in [[Miryang]], South Korea in 2004. At least 41 male high school students [[gang rape]]d several middle school and high school girls over the course of 11 months.&lt;ref name="joong2008" /&gt; The case provoked controversy due to police mistreatment of the victims and lenient handling of the offenders.&lt;ref name="rahn2004" /&gt;

==Assaults==
The victims lived in [[Ulsan]] and [[Changwon]], while the perpetrators were from Miryang and Changwon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://legacy.www.hani.co.kr/section-005000000/2004/12/005000000200412091732001.html | title = 집단성폭행 가해자 41명외 ‘70여명’ 더 있다 | work = The Hankyoreh | year = 2004 | language = Korean | accessdate = 26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perpetrators were initially believed to be members of a high school [[gang]],&lt;ref name="joong2004" /&gt; but little evidence for this was found.&lt;ref name="jeong"&gt;{{cite news|author=Jeong, Jae-Rak |date=12 December 2004 |title=Police Once Again Hurt Victimized Middle School Girls |work=The Dong-a Ilbo |url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2004121329028 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125022216/http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2004121329028 |archivedate=November 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They met the first 14-year-old victim over the phone. When she visited them, she was sexually assaulted, with the scene being filmed for blackmail.&lt;ref name="rahn2004" /&gt; According to police, she was raped up to 10 times by 3 to 24 high school boys in each occurrence,&lt;ref name="joong2004"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2503972|title=Outrage sparked by serial rape case|work=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]|date=12 December 2004|accessdate=30 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103094710/http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2503972|archivedate=3 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with at least 41 boys being involved over 11 months.&lt;ref name="joong2008" /&gt; The girl was ordered to bring her 13-year-old sister and 16-year-old cousin to Miryang,&lt;ref name="joong2004" /&gt; where the cousin was raped.&lt;ref name="rahn2004" /&gt; The original police report stated that the younger sister was sexually assaulted as well, but it may only have been a physical assault.&lt;ref name="jeong" /&gt;  The boys were also accused of raping two other girls.&lt;ref name="rahn2004"&gt;{{cite news|author=Rahn, Kim |date=12 December 2004 |title=Sexual Assault Case Provokes Uproar |work=The Korea Times |accessdate=27 March 2015 |url=http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/200412/kt2004121217002910230.htm |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050419130038/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/200412/kt2004121217002910230.htm |archivedate=April 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They allegedly extorted money from their victims.&lt;ref name="joo2005" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the sisters' aunt reported the rapes to the police,&lt;ref name="joong2008" /&gt; three of the boys were arrested. Following protests from the victims and public, another nine students were arrested, and 29 booked without detention.&lt;ref name="rahn2004" /&gt; Family members of the perpetrators threatened the victims,&lt;ref name="rahn2004" /&gt; warning them that they should "watch out from now on for reporting our sons to police."&lt;ref name="joong2004" /&gt; In a television interview, a parent of one of the offenders stated, "Why should we feel sorry for the victim's family? Why don't you consider our suffering? Who can resist temptation when girls are trying to seduce boys? They should have taught their daughters how to behave in order to avoid this kind of accident."&lt;ref name="joo2005" /&gt; One girl reportedly quit school after repeated visits and verbal attacks from the offenders' parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Lee, Claire | date = 5 March 2015 | title = Korea educates families of juvenile sex offenders | work = The Korea Herald | url = http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150305001225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversy erupted over allegations that the police had mistreated the victims, culminating in a [[candlelight vigil]] by 150 protesters.&lt;ref name="rahn2004" /&gt; The victims had asked to be questioned by a female police officer, but their request was ignored.&lt;ref name="rahn2004" /&gt; One police officer allegedly said to the victims, "Did you try to entice the guys? You ruined the reputation of Miryang. The boys who would lead the city were all arrested. What are you going to do? [...] I am afraid that my daughter will be like you."&lt;ref name="ilbo"&gt;{{cite news | author = Park Sung-woo JoongAng Ilbo | date = 18 August 2007 | title = Damages ordered paid in Milyang assault case | work = Korea JoongAng Daily | accessdate = 27 March 2015 | url = http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=2879431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police also leaked enough information to the media for the victims to be identified. Furthermore, they forced the victims to identify the suspects face-to-face, rather than through a [[one-way mirror]],&lt;ref name="joong2008" /&gt; with the officer asking the victim, "Did he insert [it] or not?"&lt;ref name="joo2005" /&gt; One of the victims had to be [[Psychiatric hospital|hospitalized]] for psychiatric treatment after these experiences.&lt;ref name="joo2005" /&gt; In August 2007, the Seoul High Court found the Miryang police officers guilty of negligence in protecting the victims, and ordered them to pay damages totaling 50 million [[Korean won|won]] to two of the victims and their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=8523&amp;categoryCode=117 |title=Police Found Guilty of Insulting Rape Victims |date=17 August 2007 |accessdate=30 April 2012 |work=[[The Korea Times]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005181646/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/nation_view.asp?newsIdx=8523&amp;categoryCode=117 |archivedate=October 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was upheld by the [[Supreme Court of South Korea]] in June 2008, which set the compensation at 70 million won.&lt;ref name="joong2008"&gt;{{cite news | date = 17 July 2008 | title = Court orders state to pay for ID leak of rape victims | work = Korea JoongAng Daily | url = http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2891213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors sent most of the accused to Juvenile Court or dropped charges. Ten others were formally accused of group sexual assault, with prosecutors asking for two to four years imprisonment with a three-year [[stay of execution]]. Citing the young age of the offenders and the fact that some had already been admitted to college or hired for jobs, the judges refused the charges against even these ten, instead sending them to Juvenile Court.&lt;ref name="joo2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Joo-Hyun, C. | year = 2005 | title = Intersectionality revealed: Sexual politics in post-IMF Korea | journal = Korea Journal | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 107–110}}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor in this decision was that the father of one of the victims formed an agreement with some of the offenders to plead for leniency after receiving a large sum of money. The father was an [[alcoholic]] who had divorced the victim's mother three years prior due to his [[domestic violence]], but retained parental rights over his daughter, and persuaded her to accept the agreement.&lt;ref name="joo2005" /&gt; Ultimately, only five suspects were sent to a [[juvenile detention center]], and none were convicted of criminal charges.&lt;ref name="ilbo" /&gt; In 2012, it emerged that the girlfriend of one of the perpetrators had become a police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nate.com/view/20120409n22558|script-title=ko:밀양 성폭행 피해자 조롱한 여학생이 경찰이 됐다고?|trans-title=The female student who derided the victims of the sexual assaults in Miryang became a police officer... ?|language=Korean|publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]]|date=9 April 2012|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.koreabang.com/2012/stories/friend-of-rapist-becomes-police-officer-netizens-disgusted.html | title = Friend of Rapist Becomes Police Officer, Netizens Disgusted | work = KoreaBang | author = Alenka | date = 15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Penan''' are a [[nomadic]] [[indigenous people]] living in [[Sarawak]] and [[Brunei]], although there is only one small community in Brunei; among those in Brunei half have been converted to Islam, even if only superficially. Penan are one of the last such peoples remaining as hunters and gatherers.{{ref|Campaign}} The Penan are noted for their practice of 'molong' which means never taking more than necessary. Most Penan were nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]s until the post-[[World War II]] [[missionary|missionaries]] settled many of the Penan, mainly in the Ulu-Baram district but also in the Limbang district. They eat plants, which are also used as [[medicine]]s, and animals and use the hides, skin, fur, and other parts for clothing and shelter.

== Demographics ==
[[File:Malaysian aboriginal Penan man (29878220402).jpg|thumb|upright|left|A Penan man from [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]].]]
The Penan number around 16,000;&lt;ref name="pustaka-sarawak.com"/&gt; of which only approximately 200 still live a nomadic lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics from [http://www.survival-international.org/tribes/penan Surivival-International.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Penan numbers have increased since they began to settle. The Penan can be broken down into two loosely related geographical groups known as either Eastern Penan or Western Penan; the Eastern Penan reside around the Miri, Baram, Limbang and Tutoh regions and the Western Penan in and around Belaga district.&lt;ref&gt;Brosius, Peter (1997) "Prior Transcripts, Divergent Paths: Resistance and Acquiesence to Logging in Sarawak, East Malaysia", ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'', Vol 39, No 3&lt;/ref&gt;

They can be considered as a native group or 'tribe' in their own right, with a language distinct from other neighbouring native groups such as the [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]], [[Kayan (Borneo)|Kayan]], [[Murut people|Murut]] or [[Kelabit people|Kelabit]]. However, in government censuses they are more broadly classified as ''[[Orang Ulu]]'' which translates as "Upriver People" and which contains distinct neighbouring groups such as those above. Even more broadly they are included in the term ''[[Dayak people|Dayak]]'', which includes all of Sarawak's indigenous people.

== Language ==
The Penan language belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. It forms an own group within the Borneo branch of the [[Borneo–Philippines languages]]. It may be somewhat related to the [[Kenyah people|Kenyah]] languages and might show some evidence of a non Austronesian substratum that might be related to [[Orang Asli]] type of language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epress.anu.edu.au/austronesians_citation.html The Austronesians - Historical and Comparative Perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lifestyle ==
[[File:Government longhouses (21379430402).jpg|thumb|right|A government sponsored [[longhouse]] in a Penan Village on the Melinau River, adjacent to [[Gunung Mulu National Park]], [[Sarawak]].]]
Penan communities were predominantly nomadic up until the 1950s. The period from 1950 to the present has seen consistent programmes by the state government and foreign Christian missionaries to settle Penan into [[longhouse]]-based villages similar to those of Sarawak's other indigenous groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bending, Tim (2006) ''Penan Histories: Contentious narratives in upriver Sarawak'' pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Some, typically the younger generations, now cultivate [[rice]] and garden vegetables but many rely on their diets of [[sago]] (starch from the [[Metroxylon sagu|sago palm]]), jungle fruits and their prey which usually include [[wild boar]], [[barking deer]], [[mouse deer]] but also snakes (especially the [[Reticulated Python]] or ''kemanen''), monkeys, birds, frogs, [[monitor lizards]], snails and even insects such as [[locusts]]. Since they practice 'molong', they pose little strain on the forest: they rely on it and it supplies them with all they need. They are outstanding hunters and catch their prey using a 'kelepud' or [[blowgun|blowpipe]], made from the Belian Tree (superb [[timber]]) and carved out with unbelievable accuracy using a bone drill – the wood is not split, as it is elsewhere, so the [[Boring (manufacturing)|bore]] has to be precise almost to the millimetre, even over a distance of 3&amp;nbsp;metres. The darts are made from the [[Metroxylon sagu|sago palm]] and tipped with [[poison]]ous [[latex]] of a tree (called the Tajem tree) found in the forest which can kill a human in a matter of minutes. Everything that is caught is shared as the Penan have a highly tolerant, generous and [[egalitarian]] society, so much so that it is said that the nomadic Penan have no word for 'thank you' because help is assumed and therefore doesn't require a 'thank you'. However, 'jian kenin' [meaning 'feel good'] is typically used in settled communities, as a kind of equivalent to 'thank you'.

Very few Penan live in Brunei any more, and their way of life is changing due to pressures that encourage them to live in permanent settlements and adopt year-around farming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/cseas/pubs/brunei/brunei.html Brunei: The Abode of Peace] - Retrieved 20 April 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626171138/http://www.hawaii.edu/cseas/pubs/brunei/brunei.html |date=26 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance to deforestation in Sarawak ==
[[File:"Better to hear you with" (6286069).jpg|thumb|upright|right|A Penan woman from Baram, [[Sarawak]].]]
"The army and the police came to our blockade and threatened us and told us to take down our barricade. We said 'we are defending our land. It is very easy for you as soldiers and policemen. You are being paid. You have money in your pockets. You can buy what you need; rice and sugar. You have money in the bank. But for us, this forest is our money, this is our bank. This is the only place where we can find food."&lt;ref&gt;Colchester, M. Pirates, ''Squatters and Poachers: The political ecology of Dispossession of the Native Peoples of Sarawak'', 1989: 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
(Penan spokesman, 1987)

The Penan came to national and international attention when they resisted logging operations in their home territories of the Baram, Limbang, Tutoh and Lawas regions of Sarawak. The Penan’s struggle began in the 1960s when the Indonesian and Malaysian governments opened up large areas of Borneo’s interior to commercial logging.&lt;ref&gt;Klare, M (2001) ''Resource Wars: The New Landscape of Global Conflict'' pp. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, the largest and most lucrative logging concessions went to members of the island’s political and business elites. With an increase in the global demand for timber at the time, these concessionaries began to procure all marketable trees from their holdings. Since both the settled, semi-nomadic and nomadic Penan communities were and are reliant on forest produce, they were hit hard by the large scale logging operations that encroached on their traditionally inhabited territories. The logging caused the pollution of their water catchment areas with sediment displacement, the loss of many [[sago]] palms that form the staple [[carbohydrate]] of Penan diet, scarcity of wild boar, deer and other game, scarcity of fruit trees and plants used for traditional forest medicine, destruction of their burial sites and loss of [[rattan]] and other rare plant and animal species.&lt;ref&gt;Klare, M (2001) ''Resource Wars: The New Landscape of Global Conflict''&lt;/ref&gt; For the forest people of Borneo, like other native tribes, such plants and animals are also viewed as sacred, as the embodiment of powerful spirits and deities.&lt;ref&gt;Manser, B (1996) ''Voices from the Rainforest: Testimonies of a Threatened People''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Penan made numerous verbal and written complaints to the logging companies and local government officials. They argued that the logging companies were located on land given to the Penan in an earlier treaty, recognised by the Sarawak state government, and were thus violating their native customary rights.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.borneoproject.org/article.php?id=270 Mudge, A (2001), "Swiss Activist Missing in Borneo"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929011512/http://borneoproject.org/article.php?id=270 |date=29 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also claimed that logging plans were never discussed with the Penan before felling began. However, these complaints fell on deaf ears. Beginning in the late 1980s and continuing today the Penan and other indigenous communities such as the [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Kelabit people|Kelabit]] and [[Kayan (Borneo)|Kayan]] (collectively referred to as [[Dayak people|Dayak]]) have set up blockades in an attempt to halt logging operations on their land. These succeeded in many areas but the efforts were hard to sustain and ended in large-scale clashes between the indigenous communities and the state-backed logging companies, supported by the police and Malaysian army. In 1987, the state government passed the amendment S90B of the Forest Ordinance, which made the obstruction of traffic along any logging road in Sarawak a major offence.&lt;ref&gt;Klare, M (2001), ''Resource Wars: The New Landscape of Global Conflict''&lt;/ref&gt; Under this law, The confrontations ended with several deaths, many injuries and large-scale arrests of indigenous people. Many of the detained reported being beaten and humiliated while in custody. An independent Sarawakian organisation IDEAL documented such claims in a 2001 fact-finding mission entitled "Not Development, but Theft".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rengah.c2o.org/news/article.php?identifer=de0125t&amp;subject=10|title=C2O.org|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=14 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829062211/http://www.rengah.c2o.org/news/article.php?identifer=de0125t&amp;subject=10|archivedate=29 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, confrontation with state authorities has not been the only source of conflict for the Penan or the Dayaks. In the late 1990s, in neighbouring Kalimantan, the Indonesian government set aside millions of acres of forest for conversion into commercial rubber and palm oil plantations.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[Resource Wars]&lt;/ref&gt; Much of these areas have been traditionally occupied by indigenous groups. Crucially, to provide labour for such developments, the Indonesian government subsidised the relocation of unemployed labourers from other parts of Indonesia (particularly Java and Madura) to Kalimantan. As part of their contracted obligations, these settlers have participated in the clearing of forests. This has resulted in (increasingly) frequent and violent conflicts between the settlers and the Dayak population.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Hundreds of people have been killed in these encounters and thousands more have been forced to live in refugee camps. Because the two warring factions have different racial and religious backgrounds, the international media has often reported this conflict as ethnic animosity. Rather, it is the pursuit of resource wealth by powerful governments and businesses, despite strong resistance by local residents, which has caused the fighting.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In the mid-1980s, when the plight of the Penan had been exposed on the world stage, the Sarawak State Government began making many promises to the Penan in an attempt to quell international protests and embarrassment. Among these were the promise of infrastructure facilities (for those who had been forced to resettle in government encampments due to deforestation) and the Magoh Biosphere Reserve.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Magoh Biosphere Reserve is an environmental ‘no intrusion’ zone introduced by Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud in 1990. However, in reality, this reserve has only ‘proposed boundaries’ within which logging companies continue to fell the forest.

The Penan explicitly outlined their wants and requirements to the Sarawak State Government of [[Abdul Taib Mahmud]] in the 2002 Long Sayan Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://borneoproject.org/article.php?id=155 Borneoproject.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909040336/http://www.borneoproject.org/article.php?id=155 |date=9 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The confrontation between the Penan and Sarawak State Government has continued to the present day. The blockade set up by the Penan community of Long Benali was forcefully dismantled on 4 April 2007 by the Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC), with support from a special police force unit and overlooked by Samling Corporation employees. Samling Corporation had been granted a logging concession by the Malaysian Timber Certificate Council (MTCC) that included land traditionally inhabited by the Penan of Long Benali and despite their continued petitions against the concession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmf.ch/en/news/?show=43|title=Bruno Manser Fonds - News|first=moxi|last=ltd.|date=|publisher=|access-date=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bruno Manser ===
{{Main article|Bruno Manser}}
[[File:Long Kerong (5101752612).jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Penan house.]]

[[Bruno Manser]] was an environmental activist and champion of the Penan's plight during their struggle in the 1990s. Manser lived with the Penan for six years; in that time he learnt their language, survival skills and customs.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Named ''lakei Penan'' (Penan man) by the Penan, he helped communicate the Penan's cause to the outside world, firstly writing letters to Chief Minister [[Abdul Taib Mahmud]] and later leaving Sarawak to educate the outside world (especially timber importing countries in Europe and Japan) about the deforestation and related social problems in Sarawak. He later conducted public awareness stunts such as paragliding onto the lawn of Chief Minister [[Abdul Taib Mahmud]] and attempting a hunger strike outside the offices of Japanese shipping companies in Tokyo.

In 1990, in response to Manser’s protests, Sarawak’s Chief Minister declared Manser an ‘enemy of the State’ and dispatched a Malaysian army unit to find and capture him.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 1990, Manser returned to his home country of Switzerland and founded the Bruno Manser Fonds (BMF), a non-profit organisation dedicated to the plight of the Penan. In 2000, Manser went missing after returning to Sarawak with a Swedish film team and an associate from BMF to reunite with a Penan group. Manser's body and belongings have never been found despite intensive searches. Theories of assassination by the Sarawak government or logging companies have sprung up because of his status as an ‘enemy of the State’.&lt;ref name="SAMIB"/&gt; Other rumours include those of suicide after years of unsuccessful campaigning or getting lost in the dense mossy forests around [[Bukit Batu Lawi]] in the Kelabit Highlands, close to the border with Kalimantan. However, Manser had lived for several years in the region with the nomadic Penan and was thus highly experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.outsideonline.com/2286231/reality-fantasy-carl-hoffmans-newest-book |title=Reality Is Fantasy in 'The Last Wild Men of Borneo' |author=Tim Sohn |publisher=Outside |date=7 March 2018 |accessdate=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five years after his disappearance in the rainforest of Borneo, Manser was officially declared as lost by the Basel Civil Court in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rengah.c2o.org/news/article.php?identifer=de0802t|title=(2010) 'Rainforest advocate Bruno Manser has been missing for ten years'|author=|date=|publisher=|access-date=14 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725115143/http://www.rengah.c2o.org/news/article.php?identifer=de0802t|archivedate=25 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personalities from politics, science and culture remembered the life of Manser in a commemoration ceremony held on 8 May 2010.

=== Response by Malaysian authorities ===
In 1987, Mahathir used the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] (ISA) to jail critics of the regime and to neutralise Penan campaigners. Over 1,200 people were arrested for challenging logging and 1,500 Malaysian soldiers and police dismantled barricades and beat and arrested people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bron Taylor|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature|year=2008|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=14-411-2278-8|page=1047}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a meeting of European and Asian leaders in 1990, Mahathir said, "It is our policy to bring all jungle dwellers together into the mainstream. There is nothing romantic about these helpless, half-starved, and disease-ridden people."&lt;ref name=lightatedge&gt;Davis, W. (2007). In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tBXgg0K7qDwC&amp;dq=James+Wong+sarawak+animals&amp;q=James+Wong#v=snippet&amp;q=James%20Wong&amp;f=false Light at the Edge of the World: A Journey Through the Realm of Vanishing Cultures]''.

Malaysian authorities also argued that it is unfair to accuse Malaysia of destroying their own rainforests while the western civilisation continued to cut their own forests down. Preservation of rainforests would mean closing down factories and hinder industrialisation which would result in unemployment issues. Instead of focusing on human rights of Penans, the western activists should focus instead on minorities in their own countries such as [[Native Americans in the United States|Red Indians]] in North America, [[Aboriginal Australians]], [[Māori people]] in New Zealand and [[Turks in Germany]].&lt;ref name=GlobalSouth&gt;Tsing, A.L(2003).

''[[The Economist]]'' was banned twice in 1991 for articles that commented critically on the Malaysian government. Its distribution was deliberately delayed three times. Newspaper editors would receive a phone call from [[Ministry of Information, Communication and Culture (Malaysia)|Ministry of Information]], warning them to "go easy" on particular topic. Few negative reports, such as logging, appeared on domestic newspapers because of the high degree of self-censorship. ''Mingguan Waktu'' newspaper was banned in December 1991 because of publishing criticisms of Mahathir administration. Mahathir defended the press censorship. He told [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] that foreign journalists "fabricate stories to entertain and make money out of it, without caring about the results of their lies".&lt;ref name=presscensorship&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]] (1992).

=== Logging today ===
[[File:Borneo Penan Elders (6331744398).jpg|thumb|right|Penan elders.]]
Logging continues to dominate politics and economics in Sarawak and the government's ambition on timber from proposed Penan ancestral land also continues. Malaysia’s rate of deforestation is the highest in the tropical world (142&amp;nbsp;km²/year) losing 14,860 square kilometres since 1990. The [[Borneo lowland rain forest]], which is the primary habitat of the Penan, and also the most valuable trees have disappeared.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Despite the (Malaysian) government's pro-environment overtones, the… government tends to side with development more than conservation." — Rhett A. Butler
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The government's defence of large-scale logging as a means to economic development has also been challenged as unsustainable, indiscriminate of indigenous rights, environmentally destructive and marred in invested interests, corruption and cronyism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rengah.c2o.org/news/category_toc.php?subject=3|title=Rengah Sarawak - News|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070723104835/http://www.rengah.c2o.org/news/category_toc.php?subject=3|archivedate=23 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this have been highlighted by the former Minister for Environment and Tourism Datuk [[James Wong (politician)|James Wong]] also being one of the state's largest logging concessionaires. Most recently,{{When|date=October 2016}} the Chief Minister [[Abdul Taib Mahmud]] himself is under investigation by Japanese tax authorities for corruption over RM32&amp;nbsp;million in timber kickbacks allegedly paid to his family company in Hong Kong to lubricate timber shipments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/257211 |title=Taib withdraws suit against Malaysiakini |author=S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is often a mutually beneficial relationship between logging companies and political elites, involving the acquisition of large private wealth for both parties through bribery, corruption and transfer pricing, at the expense of public benefit through lost revenues and royalty payments and at the expense of social, environmental and indigenous communities' rights&amp;nbsp;... The awarding of concessions and other licences to log as a result of political patronage, rather than open competitive tender, has been the norm rather than the exception in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysia-today.net/loonyMY/2005/10/how-much-is-taib-mahmud-worth.htm Malaysia Today: MT-Loony Malaysia: How much is Taib Mahmud worth?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701010659/http://www.malaysia-today.net/loonyMY/2005/10/how-much-is-taib-mahmud-worth.htm |date=1 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Threats to the Penan today ==
In August 2009, hundreds of the Penan of Borneo rainforest protested with road blockades against new palm oil and acacia plantations in Sarawak.&lt;ref&gt;[BMF News (2009) ‘New Road Blockades in the Rainforest’]&lt;/ref&gt; Their primary concern was the plantation of acacia monocultures which will cause a loss of species biodiversity and soil degeneration.

In August 2010, the Penan spoke out about the [[Murum Dam|Murum hydroelectric dam]] being built on their land.&lt;ref&gt;[Survival News and Media (2010) 'Penan Tribe Demand a Say in Dam Project']&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the dam is already well underway and will see the flooding of at least six Penan villages once completed. The Penan have argued that they were (once again) not consulted before the project began, nor was a social and environmental impact assessment prepared. Already forests, rivers and natural resources have been destroyed by the build. This time, the Penan have requested that if they must move to make room for the dam then they should have the right to choose where they move to and in what lifestyle capacity. Unfortunately the palm oil company Shin Yang has illegally moved into the area the Penan suggested, without their consent, to create a palm oil plantation. Importantly, the Penan claim that if Shin Yang are allowed to extensively fell the forest, there will not be enough forest left for their community to sustain their livelihood. Furthermore, the Murum dam is the first in a series of large-scale hydroeletric projects being planned by the Sarawak State Government, which will see the displacement of thousands of indigenous people.

In this same month, the Penan tribes in Sarawak’s northern region set up blockades to prevent the implementation of a 500&amp;nbsp;km-long Sarawak-Sabah Gas Pipeline (SSGP).&lt;ref&gt;[Malaysiakini (2010) ‘New Blockades in Sarawak Against Pipeline Threat’]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the SSGP will be built and operational by the end of 2010.{{Update inline|date=October 2016}} It will allow natural gas sourced from Sabah’s offshore gas reserves to be delivered to the liquefied natural gas complex in Bintulu. This project particularly affects Penan communities as the SSGP will claim large tracts of their Native Customary Rights land. Furthermore, the laying of this pipeline is only one component of many, set for construction on the Penan’s land, with the construction of a proposed onshore Sabah Oil and Gas Terminal (SOGT) and a gas compression station due for completion in 2012.{{Update inline|date=October 2016}}

== Future of the Penan ==
[[File:Penan woman elongated earlobes.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Old woman from Baram in Penan in [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]] with extremely elongated earlobes carrying brass pendants.]]
The future of the Penan has been a controversial subject since the confrontation between indigenous rights and state land use began. National and International Non-Governmental Organisations have been pressing for indigenous self-determination and respect for Penan human and land rights in accordance with UN [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|International Labour Organisation Convention N. 169 (1989)]] that removes “assimilationist” orientated international standards towards indigenous rights,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/62.htm|title=unhchr.ch - unhchr Resources and Information.|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a convention that Malaysia has not adopted. However, many Malaysian politicians have criticised NGOs for meddling in Malaysian domestic affairs and have accused them of attempting to inhibit development projects and keep the Penan 'undeveloped' and unassimilated into mainstream Malaysian society. Most see the Penan's lifestyle as uncivilised and antiquated (compare [[White man's burden]]), an example of this is a regularly recited poem by ex Minister for Environment and Tourism Datuk James Wong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildasia.net/main.cfm?page=article&amp;articleID=246|title=wildasia.net|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"O Penan - Jungle wanderers of the Tree &lt;br&gt;
What would the future hold for thee?....&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps to us you may appear deprived and poor &lt;br&gt;
But can Civilization offer anything better?....&lt;br&gt;
And yet could Society in good conscience &lt;br&gt;
View your plight with detached indifference &lt;br&gt;
Especially now we are an independent Nation &lt;br&gt;
Yet not lift a helping hand to our fellow brethren? &lt;br&gt;
Instead allow him to subsist in Blowpipes and clothed in Chawats [loincloths] &lt;br&gt;
An anthropological curiosity of Nature and Art? &lt;br&gt;
Alas, ultimately your fate is your own decision &lt;br&gt;
Remain as you are - or cross the Rubicon!" &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many Malaysian organisations have joined the debate such as Sahabat Alam Malaysia (SAM), Borneo Resource Institute (BRIMAS) and Rengah Sarawak. These grassroots organisations have supported indigenous rights and accused the Sarawak state government of repeated neglect of Sarwak's indigenous citizens and exploitation of Sarawak's natural resources. The Penan are more impoverished than ever, confined in sub-standard living conditions that, despite government promises, lack the most basic of facilities and infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[Utusan Konsumer Magazine (2002) ‘Baram’s Penan Community – Hungry, Poor, and Sick’]&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are forced to live in government settlements are constantly fatigued by frequent food shortages and poor health, with little access to (inadequate) health care. Many of the Dayak population have also struggled to get accustomed to a settled lifestyle and adopt agricultural skills, which they must employ more and more as their forests increasingly dwindle.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The opposition party Parti Keadilan Rakyat has also taken up the cause of the indigenous people's plight, claiming that they are "living lives of quiet desperation that now and then flares up in action that invites police attention, not to mention the notice of the rest of Malaysians who don't quite know what it is to be under the tyranny of geography."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rengah.c2o.org/news/article.php?identifer=de0510t&amp;subject=5|title=Rengah Sarawak - News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831061607/http://www.rengah.c2o.org/news/article.php?identifer=de0510t&amp;subject=5|archivedate=31 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of such NGOs many Penan communities have mapped their proposed ancestral lands and filed claims in Sarawak's courts in the hope of preventing and deterring [[illegal logging]] of their forests. A precedent was set in 2001 when an [[Iban people|Iban]] village of Rumah Nor won a court victory against Borneo Pulp and Paper and the Sarawak Government for violating their Native Customary Right (NCR) or [[adat]]. The victory was recently publicised in a short documentary,  named ''Rumah Nor'', by the Borneo Project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://borneoproject.org/article.php?id=628 ''Rumah Nor''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630171932/http://www.borneoproject.org/article.php?id=628 |date=30 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The verdict is being threatened by a Federal Court appeal by the state government and Borneo Pulp and Paper. However, 19 Penan communities have now{{When|date=October 2016}} mapped their NCR and four are beginning litigation and in others the logging has more or less stopped in the territory where litigation is pending. Indigenous action has therefore shifted from the human blockades of logging roads to empowerment through the political and legal system and international publicity.

The Penan's future also hangs on Taib Mahmud's decision to either adhere or extinguish plans for the Magoh Biosphere Reserve.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, it is Taib Mahmud who is responsible for approving and denying all logging licences. It is he and his closest friends, political associates, senior military offices and family relatives who own more or less the entire logging industry. Thus, the logging of the Sarawak has generated enormous wealth for these principle elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asiancorrespondent.com/2017/03/malaysias-taib-family-owns-160m-canadian-real-estate-empire-report/ |title=Malaysia’s Taib family owns $160m Canadian real estate empire – report |author=Max Walden |publisher=Asian Correspondent |date=31 March 2017 |accessdate=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmud therefore, has a strong economic interest in continuing to allow illegal logging in the proposed biosphere reserve areas.&lt;ref name="SAMIB"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/swiss-activist-missing-borneo |title=Swiss Activist Missing In Borneo |author=Andrew M. Mudge |publisher=Cultural Survival |date=March 2001 |accessdate=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 media release, the Malaysian logging company Samling Global Ltd. was excluded from the Government Pension Fund Global  (GPFG). This decision was made on the recommendations from the Council of Ethics’ assessment that Samling Global, and two other companies, “are contributing to or are themselves responsible for grossily &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; unethical activity”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/fin/press-center/Press-releases/2010/three-companies-excluded-from-the-govern.html?id=612790|title=Three companies excluded from the Government Pension Fund Global|first=Ministry of|last=Finance|date=23 August 2010|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee documented “extensive and repeated breaches of the licence requirements, regulations and other directives in all of the six concession areas that have been examined. Some of the violations constitute very serious transgressions, such as logging outside the concession area, logging in a protected area that was excluded from the concession by the authorities in order to be integrated into an existing national park, and re-entry logging without Environmental Impact Assessments.” If more investors, finance institutions and timber traders worldwide follow suit and cut business ties with Samling Global, this could also make the Penan’s future a little brighter.

By 2018, it held one of four Welsh seats in the [[European Parliament]], four of 40 Welsh seats in the UK Parliament, 10 of 60 seats in the [[National Assembly for Wales]], and 202 of 1,264 principal local authority councillors.&lt;ref name=Edkins&gt;Edkins, Keith [http://www.gwydir.demon.co.uk/uklocalgov/makeup.htm Local Council Political Compositions] at Gwydir.demon.co.uk, 18 February 2012.

Plaid Cymru's goals as set out in its constitution are:
# To promote the constitutional advancement of Wales with a view to attaining [[independence]] within the [[European Union]];
# To ensure economic prosperity, [[social justice]] and the health of the natural environment, based on decentralist [[socialism]];
# To build a national community based on equal citizenship, respect for different traditions and cultures and the equal worth of all individuals, whatever their race, nationality, gender, colour, creed, sexuality, age, ability or social background;
# To create a [[multilingualism|bilingual society]] by promoting the revival of the [[Welsh language]];
# To promote Wales's contribution to the global community and to attain [[member states of the United Nations|membership of the]] [[United Nations]].

In September 2008, a senior Plaid [[Member of the National Assembly for Wales|assembly member]] spelled out her party's continuing support for an independent Wales. The [[Minister for Rural Affairs|Welsh Minister for Rural Affairs]], [[Elin Jones]], began Plaid's annual conference by pledging to uphold the goal of making Wales a European Union member state. She told the delegates in [[Aberystwyth]] that the party would continue its commitment to independence under the coalition with the [[Welsh Labour|Welsh Labour Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/news/Plaid-Cymru-want-independent-Wales/article-320673-detail/article.html |title=Plaid Cymru want independent Wales |publisher=Thisissouthwales.co.uk |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings===
[[File:Penblwydd Plaid Cymru Anniversary - geograph.org.uk - 644944.jpg|thumb|Plaque commemorating the founding of {{lang|cy|Plaid Cymru, [[Pwllheli]]|italic=no}}]]
While both the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] parties of the early 20th century had accommodated demands for Welsh home rule, no political party existed for the purpose of establishing a Welsh government. {{lang|cy|Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru}} ({{lang-en|National Party of Wales}}) was formed on 5 August 1925, by [[Moses Gruffydd]], [[H. R. Jones]] and [[Lewis Valentine]], members of {{lang|cy|Byddin Ymreolwyr Cymru}} ("Home Rule Army of Wales"; literally, "Self-Rulers' Army of Wales"); and Fred Jones, [[Saunders Lewis]] and [[David John Williams]] of {{lang|cy|Y Mudiad Cymreig}} ("The Welsh Movement").&lt;ref name="Ailgeni"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rebirth of a nation: Wales, 1880–1980 |last=Morgan |first=Kenneth O.|authorlink=Kenneth O.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general election]] the party contested its first parliamentary constituency, [[Caernarvonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Caernarvonshire]], polling 609 votes, or 1.6% of the vote for that seat. The party contested few such elections in its early years, partly due to its ambivalence towards Westminster politics. Indeed, the candidate [[Lewis Valentine]], the party’s first president, offered himself in Caernarvonshire on a platform of demonstrating Welsh people's rejection of English dominion.&lt;ref name="McAllister 2001"&gt;{{cite book |last=McAllister |first=Laura |title=Plaid Cymru: the Emergence of a Political Party |year=2001 |location=Bridgend |publisher=Seren |isbn=1-85411-310-0 | authorlink = Laura McAllister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930s===
By 1932, the aims of [[self-government]] and Welsh representation at the [[League of Nations]] had been added to that of preserving Welsh language and culture. However, this move, and the party's early attempts to develop an economic critique, did not broaden its appeal beyond that of an intellectual and [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] Welsh language pressure group.&lt;ref&gt;McAllister, L, ''Plaid Cymru: the Emergence of a Political Party'' (Seren, 2001), "The tentative moves towards elaborating and broadening Plaid's policy portfolio did not allow it to shake off its early identity as a language movement or a cultural pressure group." See also Philip, A. B., ''The Welsh Question'' (University of Wales Press, 1975), "It is clear that the Welsh Nationalist Party was at the outset essentially intellectual and moral in outlook and socially conservative."&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged sympathy of the party's leading members (including President [[Saunders Lewis]]) towards Europe's [[totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]] compromised its early appeal further.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, K O, ''Welsh Devolution: the Past and the Future'' in ''Scotland and Wales: Nations Again?''

Saunders Lewis, David John Williams and Lewis Valentine attacked and set fire to the newly constructed RAF [[Penyberth]] air base on the [[Llŷn Peninsula]] in [[Gwynedd]] in 1936, in protest at its siting in the Welsh-speaking heartland. The leaders' treatment, including the trial judge's dismissal of the use of Welsh and their subsequent imprisonment in [[Wormwood Scrubs (HM Prison)|Wormwood Scrubs]], led to "The Three" becoming a ''[[cause célèbre]]''. This heightened the profile of the party dramatically and its membership had doubled to nearly 2,000 by 1939.&lt;ref name="Philip 1975" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Y tri"&gt;{{cite book |title=A companion to early twentieth-century Britain |last=Jones |first=R.

===1940s===
[[File:A Plaid Cymru rally in Machynlleth in 1949 where the "Parliament for Wales in 5 years" campaign was started (14050400654).jpg|right|thumb|A Plaid Cymru rally in Machynlleth in 1949]]
Penyberth, and Plaid Cymru’s neutral stance during the [[World War II|Second World War]], prompted concerns within the UK Government that it might be used by Germany to insert spies or carry out other covert operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.south-wales.police.uk/fe/master.asp?n1=8&amp;n2=253&amp;n3=504&amp;n4=846 Inspector Williams the Spy Catcher] at South Wales Police website. Retrieved 29 September 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112091335/http://www.south-wales.police.uk/fe/master.asp?n1=8&amp;n2=253&amp;n3=504&amp;n4=846 |date=12 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the party adopted a neutral standpoint and urged (with only limited success) [[conscientious objector|conscientious objection]] to war service.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, J, ''A History of Wales'', (1990, rev. 2007), Penguin: "Saunders Lewis ... hoped that a substantial number of Welshmen would refuse to be conscripted on the grounds that they were Welsh. He was disappointed by their response."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 Saunders Lewis contested the University of Wales parliamentary seat at a by-election, gaining 1,330 votes, or 22%. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], with party membership at around 2,500, Plaid Cymru contested seven seats, as many as it had in the preceding 20 years, including constituencies in south Wales for the first time. At this time [[Gwynfor Evans]] was elected president.

===1950s===
[[File:1959 Election in Merioneth.jpg|thumb|1959 election in Merioneth]]
[[File:BBC debate between Iorwerth Thomas (Rhondda MP) and Gwynfor Evans (15171981727).jpg|alt=Iorwerth Thomas and Gwynfor Evans sitting at a table in front of a BBC microphone, debating.|thumb|BBC debate between [[Iorwerth Thomas]] (Rhondda MP) and [[Gwynfor Evans]], Plaid Cymru's first MP]]
Gwynfor Evans's presidency coincided with the maturation of Plaid Cymru (as it now began to refer to itself) into a more recognisable political party. Its share of the vote increased from 0.7% in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 general election]] to 3.1% in [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955]] and 5.2% in [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1959]]. In the 1959 election, the party contested a majority of Welsh seats for the first time. Proposals to drown the village of [[Capel Celyn]] in the [[Tryweryn]] valley in Gwynedd in 1957 to supply the city of [[Liverpool]] with water played a part in Plaid Cymru's growth. The fact that the parliamentary bill authorising the drowning went through without support from any Welsh MPs showed that the MPs' votes in Westminster were not enough to prevent such bills from passing.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, J, ''A History of Wales'', (1990, rev. 2007), Penguin&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
Support for the party declined slightly in the early 1960s, particularly as support for the Liberal Party began to stabilise from its long-term decline. In 1962 Saunders Lewis gave a radio talk entitled ''[[Tynged yr Iaith]]'' (The fate of the language) in which he predicted the extinction of the Welsh language unless action was taken. This led to the formation of [[Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg]] (the Welsh Language Society) the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, K. O., ''Rebirth of a Nation'', (1981), OUP&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour's return to power in 1964 and the creation of the post of [[Secretary of State for Wales]] appeared to represent a continuation of the incremental evolution of a distinctive Welsh polity, following the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government's appointment of a Minister of Welsh Affairs in the mid-1950s and the establishment of [[Cardiff]] as Wales's capital in 1955.

However, in 1966, less than four months after coming in third in the constituency of [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]], Gwynfor Evans sensationally [[Carmarthen by-election, 1966|captured]] the seat from Labour at a by-election. This was followed by two further by-elections in [[Rhondda West (UK Parliament constituency)|Rhondda West]] in [[Rhondda West by-election, 1967|1967]] and [[Caerphilly (UK Parliament constituency)|Caerphilly]] in 1968 in which the party achieved massive swings of 30% and 40% respectively, coming within a whisker of victory. The results were caused partly by an anti-Labour backlash. Expectations in coal mining communities that the [[Harold Wilson|Wilson]] government would halt the long-term decline in their industry had been dashed by a significant downward revision of coal production estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, H. and Smith, D., ''The Fed: A History of the South Wales Miners in the Twentieth Century'', (1980), University of Wales&lt;/ref&gt; However, — in Carmarthen particularly — Plaid Cymru also successfully depicted Labour's policies as a threat to the viability of small Welsh communities.&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, D., ''Facing the New Challenge: Labour and Politics 1970–2000'' in ''The Labour Party in Wales 1900–2000'' (Ed. Tanner, D., Williams, C. and Hopkin, D.), (2000), University of Wales Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]] Plaid Cymru contested every seat in Wales for the first time and its vote share surged from 4.5% in 1966 to 11.5%. Gwynfor Evans lost Carmarthen to Labour, but regained the seat in [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974]], by which time the party had gained a further two MPs, representing the constituencies of [[Caernarfon]] and [[Merionethshire]].

Plaid Cymru's emergence (along with the [[Scottish National Party]]) prompted the Wilson government to establish the [[Royal Commission on the Constitution (United Kingdom)|Kilbrandon Commission]] on the constitution. The subsequent proposals for a Welsh Assembly were, however, heavily defeated in a [[Wales referendum, 1979|referendum]] in 1979. Despite Plaid Cymru's ambivalence toward home rule (as opposed to outright independence) the [[referendum]] result led many in the party to question its direction.&lt;ref name="McAllister 2001"/&gt;

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]] the party's vote share declined from 10.8% to 8.1% and Carmarthen was again lost to Labour.

===1980s===
Caernarfon MP [[Dafydd Wigley]] succeeded Gwynfor Evans as president in 1981, inheriting a party whose morale was at an all-time low. In 1981 the party adopted "community socialism" as a constitutional aim. While the party embarked on a wide-ranging review of its priorities and goals, Gwynfor Evans fought a successful campaign (including the threat of a hunger strike) to oblige the Conservative government to fulfill its promise to establish [[S4C]], a Welsh-language television station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Plaid pioneer Gwynfor Evans dies |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=21 April 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2002565.stm |accessdate=31 July 2008 |quote=Mr Evans changed the face of British politics when he became Plaid's first MP in the 1966 Carmarthen by-election. Fourteen years later he threatened to starve himself to death in the cause of Welsh language television, leading to the foundation of S4C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 [[Dafydd Elis-Thomas]] was elected president, defeating [[Dafydd Iwan]], a move that saw the party shift to the left. [[Ieuan Wyn Jones]] (later Plaid Cymru leader) captured [[Ynys Mon (UK Parliament constituency)|Ynys Môn]] from the Conservatives in [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987]]. In 1989 Dafydd Wigley once again assumed the presidency of the party.

===1990s===
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]] the party added a fourth MP, [[Cynog Dafis]], when he gained [[Ceredigion and Pembroke North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion and Pembroke North]] from the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. Dafis was endorsed by the local branch of the [[Wales Green Party|Green Party]]. The party's vote share recovered to 9.9% at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]].

In 1997, following the election of a Labour government committed to devolution for Wales, a [[Welsh devolution referendum, 1997|further referendum]] was narrowly won, establishing the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. Plaid Cymru became the main opposition to the ruling Labour Party, with 17 seats to Labour's 28. In doing so, it appeared to have broken out of its rural Welsh-speaking heartland, and captured traditionally strong Labour areas in industrial [[South Wales]].

===Plaid Cymru in the Assembly era===

====First National Assembly, 1999–2003====
In the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 1999|1999 election]] Plaid Cymru gained seats in traditional Labour areas such as [[Rhondda (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Rhondda]], [[Islwyn (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Islwyn]] and [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]], achieving by far its highest share of the vote in any Wales-wide election. While Plaid Cymru regarded itself as the natural beneficiary of devolution, others attributed its performance in large part to the travails of the Labour Party{{who|date=November 2011}}, whose nomination for [[Assembly First Secretary]], [[Ron Davies (British politician)|Ron Davies]], was forced to stand down in an alleged [[sex scandal]]. The ensuing leadership battle, won by [[Alun Michael]], did much to damage Labour, and thus aided Plaid Cymru, whose leader was the more popular and higher profile [[Dafydd Wigley]]. The Labour Party's UK national leadership was seen to interfere in the contest and deny the popular [[Rhodri Morgan]] victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Morgan is more popular — Michael |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=17 February 1999 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/281166.stm |accessdate=31 July 2008 |quote=Mr Michael, who has Prime Minister Tony Blair's backing, has been widely predicted to come first due to the form of electoral system used. An electoral college composed of three groups — politicians, trade unions and party members — will determined the winner. Large unions such as AEEU that have made their choice after a ballot of a small number of delegates are backing Mr Michael, but Mr Morgan has won every union member vote, including the shopworkers' union Usdaw on Tuesday night. Mr Morgan, a left-wing backbencher, has also repeatedly topped opinion polls taken among Labour Party members in Wales. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than two months later, in [[European Parliament election, 1999 (United Kingdom)|elections to the European parliament]], Labour support slumped further, and Plaid Cymru came within 2.5% of achieving the largest share of the vote in Wales. Under the new system of [[proportional representation]], the party also gained two MEPs.

Plaid Cymru then developed political problems of its own. Dafydd Wigley resigned, citing health problems but amid rumours of a plot against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Wigley downfall' plot denied |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=14 July 2000 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/832595.stm |accessdate=31 July 2008 |quote=Mr Wigley's announcement that he was to give up the presidency of Plaid Cymru in May came as a shock. Although he had been in hospital undergoing heart surgery, he was expected to resume his career. Some Assembly members said privately that he had taken on too much — being an MP, AM, party president and also group leader in the National Assembly. But there was also the suggestion that there was a conspiracy to oust him. }}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, [[Ieuan Wyn Jones]], struggled to impose his authority, particularly over controversial remarks made by a councillor, Seimon Glyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Moderate with a hard act to follow |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=4 April 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2905677.stm |accessdate=31 July 2008 |quote=But Mr Jones was soon facing questions about his credentials for the job. Seimon Glyn, until then a fairly obscure Plaid Cymru councillor from Gwynedd, had made controversial comments on BBC Radio Wales about inward migration into Welsh-speaking communities. The issue was raised when Mr Jones appeared on the BBC's Question Time in Caernarfon, and he was criticised for his response, in which he at first denied that Mr Glyn had referred to English as a foreign language. There were more problems when Plaid's then chief executive said that Mr Jones was on a learning curve in the job. }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Labour leader and First Minister Alun Michael was replaced by Rhodri Morgan.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]], Notwithstanding Plaid Cymru recording its highest-ever vote share in a general election, 14.3%, the party lost Wyn Jones's former seat of [[Ynys Môn (UK Parliament constituency)|Ynys Môn]] to [[Albert Owen]], although it gained [[Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen East and Dinefwr]], where [[Adam Price]] was elected.

====Second National Assembly, 2003–07====
The [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2003|Assembly elections of May 2003]] saw the party's representation drop from 17 to 12, with the seats gained in the 1999 election falling again to Labour and the party's share of the vote declining to 21%. Plaid Cymru narrowly remained the second-largest party in the National Assembly ahead of the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and [[Forward Wales]].

On 15 September 2003 [[folk music|folk-singer]] and county councillor [[Dafydd Iwan]] was elected as Plaid Cymru's president. Ieuan Wyn Jones, who had resigned from his dual role as president and Assembly group leader following the losses in the 2003 Assembly election, was re-elected in the latter role. [[Elfyn Llwyd]] remained the Plaid Cymru leader in the Westminster Parliament. Under Iwan's presidency the party formally adopted a policy of independence for Wales within Europe.

The 2004 local election saw the party lose control of the two South Wales councils it gained in 1999, [[Rhondda Cynon Taff]] and [[Caerphilly]], while retaining its stronghold of Gwynedd in the north-west. The results enabled the party to claim a greater number of ethnic minority councillors than all the other political parties in Wales combined,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epolitix.com/EN/Interviews/200609/f6812672-57e0-4c07-941d-195cbb65b1f4.htm |title=Elfyn Llwyd — Plaid Cymru parliamentary leader ePolitix interview |publisher=Epolitix.com |date=6 September 2006 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with gains in authorities such as Cardiff and [[Swansea]], where Plaid Cymru representation had been minimal. In the European Parliament elections of the same year, the party's vote share fell to 17.4%, and the reduction in the number of Welsh MEPs saw its representation reduced to one.

[[File:History of Plaid Cymru logo.jpg|thumb|Old logo (above) and new logo (below)]]

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|general election]] of 5 May 2005, Plaid Cymru lost the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion]] seat to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]; this result was a disappointment to Plaid, who had hoped to gain [[Ynys Môn (UK Parliament constituency)|Ynys Môn]]. Overall therefore, Plaid Cymru's Parliamentary representation fell to three seats, the lowest number for the party since 1992. The party's share of the vote fell to 12.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/vote2005/html/region_10.stm |title=Election 2005 results, Wales |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=1 June 2005 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the party voted constitutional changes to formally designate the party's leader in the assembly as its overall leader, with [[Ieuan Wyn Jones]] being restored to the full leadership and [[Dafydd Iwan]] becoming head of the voluntary wing{{clarify|date=April 2015}} of the party. 2006 also saw the party unveil a radical change of image, opting to use "Plaid" as the party's name, although "Plaid Cymru — the Party of Wales" would remain the official title. The party changed its logo in 2006, from the traditional green and red ''triban'' (three peaks) used since 1933, to a yellow [[Welsh poppy]] (''Meconopsis cambrica'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/4744956.stm |title=Plaid image change 'a new start' |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=24 February 2006 |accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Third National Assembly, 2007–11====
In the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2007|National Assembly election]] of 3 May 2007, Plaid Cymru increased its number of seats from 12 to 15, regaining [[Llanelli (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Llanelli]], gaining one additional list seat and winning the newly created constituency of [[Aberconwy (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Aberconwy]]. The 2007 election also saw Plaid Cymru's [[Mohammad Asghar]] become the first ethnic minority candidate elected to the Welsh Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=First ethnic minority AM elected |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=4 May 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6622925.stm |accessdate=6 May 2007 |quote=The assembly has its first ethnic minority member with the election of Plaid Cymru's Mohammad Asghar on the regional list. Mr Asghar, who was second on the Plaid list, was the fourth and final AM to be elected in South Wales East. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's share of the vote increased to 22.4%.

After weeks of negotiations involving all four parties in the Assembly, Plaid Cymru and Labour agreed to form a [[coalition government]]. Their agreed "[[One Wales]]" programme included a commitment for both parties to campaign for a Yes vote in a [[Welsh devolution referendum, 2011|referendum on full law-making powers]] for the Assembly, to be held at a time of the Welsh Assembly Government's choosing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Details of Labour–Plaid agreement |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=27 June 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6246428.stm |accessdate=31 July 2008 |quote=On the sensitive issue of giving the Welsh assembly full law-making powers, a referendum on the issue is promised "as soon as practicable, at or before the end of the assembly term (in 2011)". According to the document "both parties will then take account of the success of the bedding down of the use of the new legislative powers (which came in after last May's election) already available and, by monitoring the state of public opinion, will need to assess the levels of support for full law-making powers necessary to trigger the referendum". }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ieuan Wyn Jones was subsequently confirmed as [[First Minister of Wales|Deputy First Minister of Wales]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jones confirmed as deputy leader |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=11 July 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6290480.stm |accessdate=31 July 2008 |quote=Plaid Cymru leader Ieuan Wyn Jones said it was a "great honour" to become the Welsh assembly's Deputy First Minister.

[[Rhodri Glyn Thomas]] was appointed Heritage Minister. He later stood down, and [[Alun Ffred Jones]] took over. Ceredigion AM [[Elin Jones]] was appointed to the Rural Affairs brief in the new 10-member cabinet. [[Jocelyn Davies]] became Deputy Minister for Housing, and later, Regeneration.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], Plaid returned three MPs to Westminster. They took part in the [[Yes for Wales]] cross-party campaign for the March 2011 referendum.

====Fourth National Assembly, 2011–16====
In the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2011|2011 National Assembly election]] Plaid slipped from second place to third, being overtaken by the [[Welsh Conservative Party]] and losing its deputy leader [[Helen Mary Jones]]. The party held an inquiry into the election result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Plaid plans review of election catastrophe | date = 10 May 2011 | publisher = Wales Online | url = http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/welsh-politics/welsh-politics-news/2011/05/10/plaid-plans-review-of-election-catastrophe-91466-28663985/ | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In May 2011, Ieuan Wyn Jones announced he would stand down as leader within the first half of the Assembly term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-13389407 | publisher= BBC News | location = UK | title = Ieuan Wyn Jones to stand down as Plaid Cymru leader | date=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leadership election was held in which three candidates eventually stood: [[Elin Jones]], [[Dafydd Elis-Thomas]] and [[Leanne Wood]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Plaid Cymru leadership: Profiles of the three candidates | publisher= BBC News | date= 27 January 2012 | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-16746098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Thomas (politician)|Simon Thomas]] withdrew his candidacy before ballots were cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.golwg360.com/newyddion/cymru/64626-simon-thomas-yn-tynnu-n-ol-o-ras-arweinyddiaeth-plaid | work=Golwg360 | title=Simon Thomas yn tynnu’n ôl o ras arweinyddiaeth Plaid | date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2012, Plaid Cymru elected [[Leanne Wood]] as its new leader.

====Fifth National Assembly, 2016–present====
Following the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2016|2016 Welsh Assembly Elections]], having gained one seat Plaid Cymru became the Assembly's second largest party and briefly became the official opposition to the Welsh Government with 12 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/labour-wales-plaid-cymru-takes-rhondda-plaid-cymru|title=Labour holds Wales despite serious losses|last=Morris|first=Steven|date=6 May 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=10 February 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaid Cymru currently has ten Assembly Members, following [[Dafydd Elis-Thomas]]'s resignation from the party in 2016 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/lord-dafydd-elis-thomas-quits-12029217|title=Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas quits Plaid Cymru|last=Shipton|first=Martin|date=14 October 2016|newspaper=walesonline|access-date=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www2.partyof.wales/acau_ams|title=Assembly Members|newspaper=The Party of Wales|access-date=10 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Neil McEvoy]]'s permanent expulsion from Plaid's Assembly group in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/neil-mcevoy-expelled-plaid-cymru-14164997|title=Neil McEvoy expelled from Plaid Cymru Assembly group|first=Martin|last=Shipton|date=16 January 2018|website=Walesonline.co.uk|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helen Mary Jones]] replaced [[Simon Thomas (politician)]] as an AM in August 2018.

In the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 referendum on the UK's membership of the EU]] Plaid campaigned for a remain vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-35532863|title=Plaid: Stay in EU to solve its problems|date=10 February 2016|accessdate=21 June 2018|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wales voted 52.5% in favour of leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36612308|title=Welsh voters back Leave in EU poll|date=24 June 2016|accessdate=21 June 2018|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The 2012 figures excludes Anglesey, where the vote was delayed until 2013. The changes in seats and votes shown for 2012 are a direct comparison since the 2008 elections in the 21 councils up for election (i.e. excluding Anglesey).

In 2008 Plaid won 205 seats including six in Anglesey. For the purposes of this table the 205 figure has been reduced to 199 for the 2012 elections where the party lost 41 of the 199 seats it was defending on the night, leaving them with 158 seats.

In the [[Isle_of_Anglesey_County_Council_election,_2013|2013 elections in Anglesey]] the party won 12 seats, up from the 6 it won in 2008, (although significant boundary changes took place along with a reduction in the total number of seats available from 40 to 30.)

The 2017 figures are based on changes from the 2012 and 2013 elections.

The '''Presidential Palace''' ({{lang-fi|Presidentinlinna}}, {{lang-sv|Presidentens slott}}) is one of the three official residences of the [[President of Finland|President]] of the Republic of [[Finland]]. It is situated in [[Helsinki]], on the north side of [[Esplanadi]], overlooking [[Market Square, Helsinki|Market Square]].

==Origins and early history==
At the beginning of the 19th century, a salt storehouse stood on the site. Johan Henrik Heidenstrauch, then one of the elite of Helsinki's merchants, purchased the entire lot and erected between 1816–1820 a stately residence designed by architect Pehr Granstedt. Heidenstrauch House more resembled a palace than a merchants house. In 1837 it actually became a palace when it was purchased for the price of 170 000 roubles to be converted into a residence for the [[Governor-General of Finland]]. However, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] desired that it should become the official residence in Helsinki of the [[Tsar|Tsar of Russia]]/[[Grand Duke of Finland]], and the building became the ''Imperial Palace in Helsinki''.

The necessary rebuilding and furnishing work, carried out between 1843 and 1845, was directed by architect [[Carl Ludvig Engel]], the creator of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] Helsinki and, after his death, by his son, Carl Alexander. All the timber storehouses behind were torn down and a new wing added. This wing, built along the north of the courtyard, contained on the second floor the chapel (the present library), ballroom, banquet hall in direct connection with the earlier reception floor of the main building, as well as a kitchen.

==Imperial Palace==
The Palace was completed in 1845, though repairs had to be made from time to time as mostly it stood empty and was not regularly heated. It was visited for the first time by a member of the Imperial family nine years later, in February 1854, when [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]]'s younger son, [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine]], stayed there for a month. His brother [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaievich of Russia|Nicholas]] stayed there in June of the following year, after Nicholas's death. In 1856, the palace was also visited by the new Tsar's three oldest sons – [[Grand Duke Nicholas Alexandrovich of Russia|Nicholas]], [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander]], and [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Vladimir]]. It was during the reign of their father, [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], that the Palace had its most brilliant time. He visited the city in 1863 and 1876, staying on both occasions at the Palace. In 1863 the [[Diet of Finland]] was opened by Alexander II in the Great Ballroom. The Ballroom was accordingly converted into a Throne-Room, with the Imperial throne placed on a dais. Alexander returned to the palace again in 1876 to open that year's session of the Diet. The Throne-Room continued to be used as the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Diet until 1906.

That was the last Imperial festivity in the palace. [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] did stay there in 1885 (although he resided at his Finnish  residence in [[Langinkoski]] more often). The palace was refurbished during 1904–1907 by [[Johan Jakob Ahrenberg|Johan Jakob (Jac) Ahrenberg]]. He built  a new suite of reception rooms, including a new Throne Room (the present Hall of State) where the sculpture ''Psyche and Zephyr'' by [[Walter Runeberg]] was placed, and a reception vestibule facing Mariankatu. The palace was last visited by a member of the Imperial family when [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] visited the palace for one day in 1915.

==Post-imperial use==
Under the political conditions of [[World War I]] the palace was converted into ''Helsinki Temporary Military Hospital I'' in October 1915. With the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 and the abdication of the Tsar/Grand Duke, the palace ceased to be a military hospital and became the property of the [[Senate of Finland|Senate]] which renamed it as the ''Former Imperial Palace''. From March to April 1918, the palace was used as the headquarters of the Executive Committee of the Helsinki Workers and Soldiers Soviet. With the victory of the Whites in the [[Finnish Civil War]], the Reds abandoned the Palace, which was temporarily used by German and White Finnish military staff. From June 1918 onwards, renovations and repairs were made to the palace in anticipation of its role as a royal residence for [[Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse-Kassel|Prince Frederick of Hesse]], who was elected as [[King of Finland]] in October 1918. However, the international political situation in the aftermath of World War I led to him renouncing his acceptance of the Finnish throne in December 1918. Following this, the upper floors served as the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

==Presidential Palace and office==
After the new [[Constitution of Finland|Constitution]] was passed in 1919 it was clear that the most suitable residence for the [[President of Finland|President]] was the Former Imperial Palace. Complete repairs were made at speed, with the furnishings and art collections of the Palace being returned from storage in the [[National Museum of Finland|National Museum]] and the [[Ateneum]] Art Museum, and also being supplemented. Since then, it has been the official residence of the President. The Palace was again refurbished and modernised by Martti Välikangas in 1938.
[[File:The Presidential Palace, Helsinki, Finland 05.jpg|300px|thumb|left|The Presidential Palace, Helsinki]]
The Presidential Palace served as the official residence of all the Presidents of Finland up to 1993, except for Presidents [[Risto Ryti|Ryti]], [[Gustaf Mannerheim|Mannerheim]], and [[Urho Kekkonen|Kekkonen]], who preferred to reside at [[Tamminiemi]]. The Palace ceased to be used as the President's principal official residence during the presidency of [[Urho Kekkonen]]. He and his wife disliked the noise of nearby traffic and the lack of gardens, and soon moved to [[Tamminiemi]], which remained Kekkonen's residence until his death. However, the palace again served as the principal residence of the President during the presidency of [[Mauno Koivisto]], until the new residence, [[Mäntyniemi]], was completed.

The Palace contains private apartments and reception rooms for the President on its third floor, including the Yellow Room, the Red Waiting Room, and the President's Study. The Palace also contains the Office of the President, which includes offices for the Secretary General, the Special Counsel to the President, and the Master of the Household. The Palace's State rooms include the Hall of State, the Dining Hall, and the Hall of Mirrors (the small Hall of State). They are used by the President for official functions and receptions. These include the promotion and appointment ceremony for Defence Forces and Frontier Guard cadets, State Banquets, and the [[Finnish Independence Day reception|Independence Day reception]].

The latest major renovations to the palace were done in 2012–2014 when the building services engineering was brought up to date for a cost of 45 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands tour newly-renovated Presidential Palace|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/thousands_tour_newly-renovated_presidential_palace/8318030|accessdate=21 September 2015|work=Yle News|date=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visitors==
[[File:Palacio Presidencial, Helsinki, Finlandia, 2012-08-14, DD 01.JPG|thumb|Detail view of the front of the building]]
In its role as the official residence of the President of Finland, the Presidential Palace has hosted a number of important foreign visitors and dignitaries. Royal visitors to the palace have included [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden]], [[Olav V of Norway]], [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]], [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran]], and [[Akihito|Emperor Akihito of Japan]]. A number of [[President of the United States of America|US Presidents]] have visited the palace, including [[Gerald Ford]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[George H. W. Bush]]. Other distinguished visitors have included [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Josip Broz Tito]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], [[Boris Yeltsin]], [[Horst Köhler]], [[Xi Jinping]], [[Shinzō Abe]], and [[Vladimir Putin]]. President [[Donald Trump]] of the [[United States]] visited the palace for [[2018 Russia–United States summit|the 2018 USA-Russia summit]] with Putin on July 16th, 2018.

Visiting guests do not stay at the Presidential Palace nowadays, although they did in the past. Although the palace has nearly 3&amp;nbsp;000 square metres of floor space, and private apartments for the President and their family, much of the palace is occupied by offices and accommodation for the Office of the President, including the Secretary General, Presidential Cabinet, military ''Aides-de-Camp'', and the household staff. Foreign guests can be housed at [[Mäntyniemi]], the [[Königstedt Manor]] in [[Vantaa]], or the [[Finnish State Guesthouse]] next to the [[Hilton Helsinki Kalastajatorppa]] Hotel in [[Munkkiniemi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9640">The '''Presidential Young Investigator Award''' (PYI) was awarded by the [[National Science Foundation]] of the [[United States Federal Government]]. The program operated from 1984 to 1991, and was replaced by the NSF Young Investigator (NYI) Awards and Presidential Faculty Fellows Program (PFF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/pr/91/910927Arc1164.html "Young Investigator Awards Program revised", Stanford University News Service, September 27, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

The award gave minimum of $25,000 a year for five years from NSF, with the possibility of up to $100,000 annually if the PYI obtained matching funds from industry.  The program was criticized in 1990 as not being the best use of NSF funds in an era of tight budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cen-v068n045.p024 | volume=68 | issue=45 | title=Presidential Young Investigator Awards Program under Review | year=1990 | journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News | pages=24–49 | last1 = Zurer | first1 = Pamela S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cen-v068n050.p007 | volume=68 | issue=50 | title=NSF young investigator program may be slashed | year=1990 | journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News | page=7 | last1 = Zurer | first1 = Pamela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Owen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|ɪ|n}}; 14 May 1771 – 17 November 1858) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] textile manufacturer, philanthropic social reformer, and one of the founders of [[utopian socialism]] and the [[cooperative]] movement. Owen is best known for his efforts to improve the working conditions of his factory workers and his promotion of experimental socialistic communities. In the early 1800s Owen became wealthy as an investor and eventual manager of a large textile mill at [[New Lanark]], [[Scotland]]. (He initially trained as a [[draper]] in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], Lincolnshire, and worked in [[London]] before relocating at the age of 18 to [[Manchester]] and going into business as a textile manufacturer.) In 1824 Owen travelled to America, where he invested the bulk of his fortune in an experimental socialistic community at [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], Indiana, the preliminary model for Owen's utopian society. The experiment was short-lived, lasting about two years. Other [[Owenite]] utopian communities met a similar fate. In 1828 Owen returned to the [[United Kingdom]] and settled in London, where he continued to be an advocate for the working class. In addition to his leadership in the development of [[cooperative]]s and the trade union movement, he also supported passage of child labour laws and free, co-educational schools.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Newtown Parish Register for births with an entry for Robert Owen, born June 12th 1771 (1294584).jpg|thumb|260px|Baptism record of Robert Owen in the Newtown Parish Register]]

Robert Owen was born in [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]], a small market town in [[Montgomeryshire]], Wales, on 14 May 1771, to Anne (Williams) and Robert Owen. His father was a [[saddle]]r, [[ironmongery|ironmonger]], and local postmaster; his mother was the daughter of a Newtown farming family. Young Robert was the sixth of the family's seven children, two of whom died at a young age. His surviving siblings were William, Anne, John, and Richard.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Arthur H. Estabrook | title =The Family History of Robert Owen | journal =Indiana Magazine of History | volume =19 | issue =1 | pages =63, 69 | publisher =Indiana University | location =Bloomington | date =1923|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/6280| accessdate =August 29, 2017}} See also: {{cite book | author=Frank Podmore | title =Robert Owen: A Biography | publisher =D.

Owen received little formal education, but he was an avid reader. He left school at the age of ten and was apprenticed to a [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], Lincolnshire, [[draper]] for four years. He also worked in London draper shops as a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, p. 63; Podmore, pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rees&gt;{{cite web| author=Sir James Frederick Rees| title =Owen, Robert ( 1771-1858 ), Utopian Socialist | work =Dictionary of Welsh Biography | publisher =National Library of Wales | date =2007 | url = http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-OWEN-ROB-1771.html | accessdate =30 August 2017}} (online version)&lt;/ref&gt; Around the age of eighteen, Owen moved to Manchester, where he spent the next twelve years of his life. Initially, he was employed at Satterfield's Drapery in Saint Ann's Square.&lt;ref&gt;Podmore, pp. 23, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A memorial plaque marks the firm's location.

While living in Manchester, Owen borrowed £100 from his brother, William, to enter into a partnership to make [[spinning mule]]s, a new invention for spinning cotton thread, but exchanged his share of the business within a few months for six spinning mules that he operated in a rented factory space.&lt;ref&gt;Podmore, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1792, when Owen was about twenty-one years old, mill-owner [[Peter Drinkwater]] made him manager of the [[Piccadilly Mill]] at Manchester; however, after two years of working for Drinkwater, Owen voluntarily gave up a contracted promise of partnership, left the company, and went into partnership with other entrepreneurs to establish and eventually manage the Chorlton Twist Mills in the [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]] area of Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;Podmore, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite web| author= | title =Robert Owen Timeline | work = | publisher =Robert Owen Museum | date =2008 | url = http://robert-owen-museum.org.uk/time_line| format = | accessdate =29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1790s, Owen's entrepreneurial spirit, management skills, and progressive moral views were emerging. In 1793, he was elected as a member of the [[Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society]],&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt; where the ideas of [[Reformation|reformers]] and philosophers of [[age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] were discussed. He also became a committee member of the [[Manchester Board of Health]], which was instigated, principally by [[Thomas Percival]], to promote improvements in the health and working conditions of factory workers.&lt;ref name=Thornber&gt;{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Thornber|title =Thomas Percival, 1740-1804| publisher=Chesire Antiquities| url = https://www.thornber.net/cheshire/ideasmen/percival.html| accessdate = 30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kimberling&gt;{{cite web|first=Clark|last=Kimberling|title =Robert Owen (1771-1858) social reformer, founder of New Harmony| publisher = University of Evansville|url = https://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/bstud/robtowen.html| accessdate =30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Robert Owen's House, New Lanark.jpg|thumb|260px|Robert Owen's house in [[New Lanark]], Scotland.]]

During a visit to [[Scotland]], Owen met and fell in love with Ann (or Anne) Caroline Dale, the daughter of [[David Dale]], a [[Glasgow]] philanthropist and the proprietor of New Lanark Mills, a large textile mill in [[New Lanark]], Scotland. Robert and Caroline Owen were married on 30 September 1799. Following their marriage, the Owens established their home in New Lanark, but later moved to Braxfield, Scotland.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Estabrook64&gt;Estabrook, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert Dale Owen| title =Threading My Way, Twenty-seven Years of Autobiography | publisher =G.

Robert and Caroline Owen had eight children, the first of whom died in infancy. Their seven surviving children included four sons and three daughters: Robert Dale (1801–77), William (1802–42), Ann (or Anne) Caroline (1805–31), Jane Dale (1805–61), David Dale (1807–60), Richard Dale (1809–90) and Mary (1810–32).&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, pp. 72, 80, 83; {{cite book |author=Victor Lincoln Albjerg |title=Richard Owen: Scotland 1810, Indiana 1890 |series=The Archives of Purdue, no. 2|date=March 1946 |publisher= |location=Lafayette, Indiana |page=16}} See also: {{cite web| author= | title =Richard Owen | work = | publisher =Indiana Department of Administration | date = | url = http://www.in.gov/idoa/2783.htm | accessdate =September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen's four sons, Robert Dale, William, David Dale, and Richard, as well as his daughter, Jane Dale, followed their father to the United States, becoming U.S. citizens and permanent residents of New Harmony, Indiana. Owen's wife, Caroline, and two of their daughters, Anne Caroline and Mary, remained in Britain, where they died in the 1830s.&lt;ref name=Estabrook72&gt;Estabrook, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Traces11&gt;Pitzer, "Why New Harmony is World Famous," in ''Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Lanark textile mill==
In July 1799 Owen and his partners bought the New Lanark mill from David Dale, and Owen became the New Lanark mill's manager in January 1800.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Estabrook64/&gt; Encouraged by his success in the management of cotton mills in Manchester, Owen hoped to conduct the New Lanark mill on higher principles than purely commercial ones. David Dale and [[Richard Arkwright]] had established the substantial mill at New Lanark in 1785. With its water power provided by the falls of the [[River Clyde]], the cotton-spinning operation became one of Britain's largest. About 2,000 individuals were associations with the mill; 500 of them were children who were brought to the mill at the age of five or six from the poorhouses and charities of [[Edinburgh]] and Glasgow. Dale, who was known for his benevolence, treated the children well, but the general condition of New Lanark's residents was unsatisfactory. Over the years, Dale and his son-in-law, Owen, worked to improve the factory workers' lives.&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison34&gt;John F. C. Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America," in {{cite book | author=Donald E.

Many of the workers were in the lowest levels of the population; theft, drunkenness, and other vices were common; education and sanitation were neglected; and most families lived in one room. The respectable country people refused to submit to the long hours and demoralising drudgery of the mills.&lt;ref name=AdventuresSocialism&gt;{{cite web|first=Alex|last=cullen|title =Adventures in Socialism New Lanark establishment and Orbiston community| date =1891| url =https://archive.org/stream/cu31924030362721/cu31924030362721_djvu.txt| accessdate =30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until a series of [[Truck Acts]] (1831–1887) required employees to be paid in common currency, many employers operated the [[truck system]] that paid workers in total or in part with tokens. The tokens had no monetary value outside the mill owner's "truck shop," where the owners could supply shoddy goods and charge top prices.&lt;ref name="WeekesThesis"&gt;{{cite thesis|first=Richard|last=Weekes|title =The British retail co-operative movement| type=MSa|publisher =University of Central Lancashire| date =2004| url = http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/2932/1/Weekes_2004.pdf| accessdate = 30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to other employers,  Owen's store offered goods at prices slightly above their wholesale cost.&lt;ref name=Estabrook64/&gt;
He also passed on the savings from the bulk purchase of goods to his workers, and placed the sale of alcohol under strict supervision. These principles became the basis for the cooperative shops in Britain, which continue in an altered form to trade today.&lt;ref name=Thornber /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloy"&gt;{{cite web|first=Marjie|last=Bloy|title =Robert Owen and the Co-operative movement| publisher =A web of English History| date =4 Mar 2016| url =http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/economic/owencoop.htm | accessdate =30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and influence==
Owen tested his social and economic ideas at New Lanark, where he won the confidence of his workers and continued to have great success due to the improved efficiency at the mill. The community also earned an international reputation. Social reformers, statesmen, and royals, including the future Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]], visited New Lanark to study its operations and educational methods.&lt;ref name=Estabrook64/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Kent Schuette| coauthors = | title =New Harmony, Indiana: Three Great Community Experiments | journal =Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =26 | issue =2 | page=45 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | date =Spring 2014| url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinions of many of these visitors were favourable.&lt;ref name=Harrison37&gt;Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen's greatest success was his support of youth education and early childcare. As a pioneer of infant care in Britain, especially Scotland, Owen provided an alternative to the "normal authoritarian approach to child education."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America, " in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The manners of the children brought up under his system were beautifully graceful, genial and unconstrained; health, plenty, and contentment prevailed; drunkenness was almost unknown; and illegitimacy extremely rare. Owen's relationship with the workers remained excellent, and all the operations of the mill proceeded with smoothness and regularity. Furthermore, the business was a commercial success.&lt;ref name=AdventuresSocialism /&gt;&lt;ref name=Estabrook64 /&gt;

However, some of Owen's schemes displeased his partners, forcing him to arrange for other investors to buy his share of the business in 1813 for $800,000 (US).&lt;ref name=Estabrook64/&gt; The new investors, who included [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]], a well-known [[Quaker]], were content to accept a £5000 return on their capital.&lt;ref name=AdventuresSocialism /&gt; The ownership change also provided Owen with an opportunity to widen the scope for his philanthropy. He became an advocate for improvements in workers' rights, child labour laws, and free education for children.&lt;ref name=Estabrook64/&gt;

In 1813 Owen authored and published ''A New View of Society, or Essays on the Principle of the Formation of the Human Character'', the first of four essays that he wrote to explain the principles behind his reform-minded and [[socialist]]ic philosophy.&lt;ref name=GS269-70&gt;{{cite book | author=Linda C. Gugin and James E. St. Clair, eds. | title =Indiana's 200: The People Who Shaped the Hoosier State | publisher =Indiana Historical Society Press| year =2015 | location =Indianapolis | pages=269–70 | url = | isbn =978-0-87195-387-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen had originally been a follower of the classical liberal and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] Jeremy Bentham, who believed that free markets, in particular, the right of workers to move and choose their employers, would release the workers from the excessive power of capitalists. However, Owen developed his own, pro-socialist outlook. In addition, Owen, a [[Deism|deist]], criticised organised religion, including the [[Church of England]], and developed a belief system of his own.&lt;ref name=Traces12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Ryan Rokicki| coauthors = | title =Science in Utopia: New Harmony's Naturalistic Legacy | journal =Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =26 | issue =2 | page=52 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | date =Spring 2014| url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen felt that human character is formed by circumstances over which individuals have no control. As a result, individuals cannot be praised or blamed for their behaviour or situation in life. This principle led Owen to the conclude that the secret behind the correct formation of people's characters is to place them under proper environmental influences – physical, moral and social – from their earliest years. These notions of the irresponsibility of humans and of the effect of early influences on an individual's character formed the basis of Owen's system of education and social reform.&lt;ref&gt;Merle Curti, "Robert Owen in American Thought," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relying on his own observations, experiences, and thoughts, Owen considered his view of human nature to be original and "the most basic and necessary constituent in an evolving science of society. "&lt;ref name=Curti61&gt;Curti, "Robert Owen in American Thought," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen's philosophy was influenced by Sir [[Isaac Newton]] 's views on natural law, and his views resembled those of [[Plato]], [[Denis Diderot]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], [[William Godwin]], [[John Locke]], [[James Mill]], and [[Jeremy Bentham]], among others. Owen did not have the direct influence of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers.&lt;ref name=Curti61/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Panel Discussion," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen's work at New Lanark continued to have significance throughout Britain and in continental Europe. He was a "pioneer in factory reform, the father of distributive cooperation, and the founder of nursery schools."&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; His schemes for the education of his workers included the opening of the Institute for the Formation of Character at New Lanark in 1818.

Owen also had interviews and communications with the leading members of the British government, including its premier, Robert Banks Jenkinson, and [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]]. Owen met with many of the rulers and leading statesmen of Europe.&lt;ref name=Dowd&gt;{{cite web|first=Douglas|last=Dowd|title=Robert Owen: British Social Reformer|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Owen| accessdate= 30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guru&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Owen|publisher=Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/news/2008/10/31/robert-owen|date=31 Oct 2008|accessdate=30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen also adopted new principles to raise the standard of goods his workers produced. A cube with faces painted in different colours was installed above each machinist's workplace. The colour of the face showed to everyone who saw it the quality and quantity of goods the worker completed. The intent was to provide incentives to workers to do their best. Although it was not a great incentive by itself, the conditions at New Lanark for the workers and their families were idyllic for the time.&lt;ref name=Guru /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dowd /&gt;

===Eight-hour day===
Owen raised the demand for an [[eight-hour day]] in 1810, and instituted the policy at [[New Lanark]]. By 1817 he had formulated the goal of the eight-hour workday and coined the slogan: "Eight hours labour, Eight hours recreation, Eight hours rest."&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{Cite web|first=Marguerite|last=Ward|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=3 May 2017|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/03/how-the-8-hour-workday-changed-how-americans-work.html|title=A brief history of the 8-hour workday, which changed how Americans work|accessdate=30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Models for socialism (1817)===
[[File:Robert Owen Statue, Balloon Street, Manchester.jpg|thumb|upright|260px|A statue commemorating Owen in [[Manchester]], in front of [[The Co-operative Bank]].]]

Owen embraced socialism in 1817,  a turning point in his life, and began making specific efforts to implement what he described as his "New View of Society."&lt;ref name=Harrison34/&gt; Owen outlined his position in a report to the committee of the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] regarding the country's [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Laws]].&lt;ref name=CommitteeReport&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Owen|title=To the Chairman of The Committee on the Nation's Poor Laws| publisher=University of Texas|url=http://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/368/368owenrptcom.html|date=12 Mar 1817|accessdate=30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, when misery and trade stagnation after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] were capturing the attention of the country, the British government invited Owen to offer his advice on what could be done to alleviate the industrial concerns. Although Owen attributed the immediate causes of misery to the wars, he also argued that the underlying cause of distress was the competition of human labour with machinery and recommended the establishment of self-sufficient communities.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;

Owen proposed that communities of about 1,200 people should be settled on land from {{convert|1000|to|1500|acre|ha|0}}, with all of them living in one large building that had a public kitchen and dining halls. (The size of his proposed community is likely to have been influenced by the size of the village of New Lanark.) Owen also recommended that each family should have its own private apartments and the responsibility for the care of their children until they reached the age of three. Thereafter, children would be raised by the community-at-large, but their parents would have access to them at mealtimes and on other occasions. Owen further suggested that these socialistic communities might be established by individuals, parishes, [[county|counties]], or other governmental units. In every case there would be effective supervision by qualified persons. The work and the enjoyment of its results should be experienced communally. Owen believed that his idea would be the best form for the re-organisation of society in general.&lt;ref name=AdventuresSocialism /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dowd /&gt; He called his vision for a socialistic utopia the "New Moral World."&lt;ref name=GS269-70/&gt;

Owen's utopian model changed little during his lifetime. His fully developed model considered an association of 500 to 3,000 people as the optimum number for a good working community. While mainly agricultural, it would possess the best machinery, offer a variety of employment, and, as far as possible, be self-contained. Owen further explained that as the number of these communities increased, "unions of them federatively united shall be formed in circle of tens, hundreds and thousands"&lt;ref name="BloyVillages"&gt;{{cite web|first=Marjie|last=Bloy|title =Robert Owen and 'villages of co-operation'| publisher =A web of English History| date =4 Mar 2016| url = http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/ruralife/owenvill.htm| accessdate =30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; linked in a common interest.

===Arguments against Robert Owen and his answers===
Owen always tried to spread his ideas to wider communities. First of all, he started publishing his ideas in newspapers. Owen then sent these newspapers to parliamentarians, politicians all over the country, and other important people. The first negative reactions to his ideas appeared after these newspaper articles were published. 

The opponents of Owen’s ideas thought that Owen’s plans would result in an uncontrollable increase in population and poverty. The other main criticism stated that Owen’s plan and the common use of everything would essentially make the country one large workshop. [[William Hone]] claimed that Owen saw people as unravelled plants from his roots, and that he wanted to plant them into rectangles. Another spokesman accused Owen of wanting to imprison people in workshops like barracks and eradicate their personal independence. 

Owen’s opponents had begun to regard him as an enemy of religion. His influence with the ruling circles, which he had hoped would help him to accomplish his “Plan”, started diminishing and rumours about his lack of religious conviction spread. Owen believed that, unless a change can be made in the character of the individuals and the environment in which they live, these people will be hostile to those around them. As long as such a social order is perpetuated, the positive aspects of Christianity can never be put into practice. Owen also considered it necessary to give people more freedom in order to improve the situation of the poor and working classes. Unless people are better educated, unless they gain more useful information and have permanent employment, they are a danger to the security of the state when given more freedom than the British Constitution of the time. Without having to make any changes in the national institutions, he believed that even merely reorganizing the working classes would result in great benefits. Owen was thus opposed to the views of radicals who wanted to bring about a change in the public's mentality through the expansion of voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sosyalizmin öncülerinden Robert Owen: Yaşamı, öğretisi, eylemi|last=Aybay|first=Rona|publisher=YKY|year=2005|isbn=|location=İstanbul|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community experiments in America and Britain==
[[File:New harmony vision.jpg|thumb|350px|[[New Moral World]], Owen's envisioned successor of [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]]. [[Owenism|Owenites]] fired bricks to build it, but it was never constructed.]]

To test the viability of his ideas for self-sufficient working communities, Owen began experiments in communal living in America in 1825. Among the most famous of these was the one established at [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], Indiana.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; Of the 130 identifiable communitarian experiments in America before the [[American Civil War]], at least sixteen were [[Owenism|Owenite]] or Owenite-influenced communities. New Harmony was Owen's earliest and most ambitious experiment.&lt;ref name=Harrison37/&gt;

Owen and his son, William, sailed to America in October 1824 to establish an experimental community in Indiana.&lt;ref name=Leopold21&gt;{{cite book| author=Richard William Leopold | title = Robert Dale Owen, A Biography | publisher =Harvard University Press | series =Harvard Historical Studies | volume =45 | edition = | year =1940 | location =Cambridge, Massachusetts | page=21 | url = | OCLC=774894}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1825 Owen used a portion of his own funds to finalise the purchase of an existing town that included 180 buildings and several thousand acres of land along the Wabash River in [[Indiana]]. (In 1824
[[George Rapp]]'s [[Harmony Society]], the religious group that owned the property and had founded the communal village of Harmony (or Harmonie) on the site in 1814, decided to relocate to [[Pennsylvania]].) Owen renamed it New Harmony and established the village as his preliminary model for a utopian community.&lt;ref name="GS269-70" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Karl J. R.

Owen attempted to gain support for his socialist vision among American thinkers, reformers, intellectuals, and public statesmen. On 25 February and 7 March 1825, Owen delivered addresses in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] and others in the U.S. government that outlined his vision and plans for the utopian community at New Harmony, Indiana, as well as his socialist beliefs.&lt;ref name=GS269-70/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, p. 66. See also:{{cite book|author=Robert Owen|title=Manifesto of Robert Owen: The discoverer, Founder, and Promulgator, of the Rational System of Society, and of the Rational Religion |year=1840 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience to hear his ideas included three former [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] ([[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[James Madison]]), in addition to outgoing U.S. president [[James Monroe]], and president-elect [[John Quincy Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rowland Hill Harvey|title=Robert Owen: Social Idealist|publisher=University of California Press|year=1947|pages=99–100|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His meetings were possibly the first discussions about socialism in the Americas; they were certainly a major step towards the beginnings of discussions about socialist thought in the United States. [[Owenism]], among the first socialist ideologies active in the United States, is considered the starting-point of the modern Socialist movement in the United States.&lt;ref name=WeekesThesis /&gt;&lt;ref name=AdventuresSocialism /&gt;

Owen convinced [[William Maclure]], a wealthy scientist, philanthropist, and Scot who was living in Philadelphia to join him at New Harmony. Maclure became Owen's financial partner. Maclure's involvement in the project subsequently attracted scientists, educators, and artists such as [[Thomas Say]], [[Charles-Alexandre Lesueur]], and Madame [[Marie Duclos Fretageot]], among others. These individuals helped to establish the utopian community at New Harmony as a centre for educational reform, scientific research, and artistic expression.&lt;ref name=GS269-70/&gt;&lt;ref name=Traces2-25&gt;{{cite journal| author=Amanda S.

Although he intended to build a "Village of Unity and Mutual Cooperation" south of town, his grand plan was never fully realised, and Owen returned to Britain to continue his work. During his long absences from New Harmony, Owen left the experiment under the day-to-day management of his sons, [[Robert Dale Owen]] and William Owen, and his business partner, Maclure. The New Harmony communal experiment proved to be an economic failure, lasting about two years, but it attracted more than a thousand residents by the end of its first year. The socialistic society was dissolved in 1827; however, many of the town's scientists, educators, and artists, and other inhabitants, including Owen's four sons, Robert Dale, William, David Dale, and Richard Dale Owen, and his daughter, Jane Dale Owen Fauntleroy, resided at New Harmony after the social experiment ended.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=GS269-70/&gt;&lt;ref name=Traces2-25/&gt;

Other utopian experiments in the United States included communal settlements at Blue Spring, near [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], Indiana; [[Yellow Springs, Ohio|Yellow Springs]], Ohio; and the [[Owenism|Owenite]] community of [[Forestville Commonwealth]] at [[Coxsackie (town), New York|Earlton]], New York, as well as other projects in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Tennessee]]. Nearly all of these experiments ended before New Harmony was dissolved in April 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Branigin, "Robert Owen's New Harmony: An American Heritage," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forestville Commonwealth was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974. See {{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen's utopian communities attracted a mix of people, many of whom had the highest aims; however, their members also included vagrants, adventurers, and crotchety, and other reform-minded enthusiasts. In the words of Owen's son, David Dale Owen, the communities attracted "a heterogeneous collection of Radicals", "enthusiastic devotees to principle," and "honest [[latitudinarians]], and lazy theorists," with "a sprinkling of unprincipled sharpers thrown in."&lt;ref name="clayton"&gt;{{cite book |author=Joseph Clayton |title=Robert Owen: Pioneer of Social Reforms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nuspAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=x2fIRmQvqi&amp;dq=%22a%20heterogeneous%20collection%20of%20radicals%22&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20heterogeneous%20collection%20of%20radicals%22&amp;f=false |year=1908|publisher=A.C. Fifield
|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josiah Warren]], one of the participants at New Harmony, asserted that community was doomed to failure due to a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and personal property. In describing the Owenite community, Warren explained: "We had a world in miniature — we had enacted the French revolution over again with despairing hearts instead of corpses as a result.&amp;nbsp;... It appeared that it was nature's own inherent law of diversity that had conquered us&amp;nbsp;... our "united interests" were directly at war with the individualities of persons and circumstances and the instinct of self-preservation&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, ''Periodical Letter II'' (1856)&lt;/ref&gt; Warren's observations on the reasons for the community's failure led to the development of [[American individualist anarchism]], of which he was its original theorist.
&lt;ref name="JosiahWarren"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jeff|last=Riggenbach|title=Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist|date=23 Feb 2011|url=https://mises.org/library/josiah-warren-first-american-anarchist|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have attributed the demise of the New Harmony experiment to a series of disagreements among its members.&lt;ref name=Estabrook68&gt;Estabrook, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social experiments also began in Scotland in 1825, when [[Abram Combe]], an Owenite disciple, attempted the development of a utopian experiment at [[Orbiston, Scotland|Orbiston]], near Glasgow, but the project failed after a trial of about two years.
&lt;ref name="Garnett"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald|last=Garnett|title=Co-operation and the Owenite Socialist Communities in Britain, 1825-45|date=1972|publisher=Manchester University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1830s additional experiments in socialistic cooperatives were made in [[Ireland]] and Britain. The most important of these were that at [[Ralahine]], established in 1831 in [[County Clare]], Ireland, and at [[East Tytherley|Tytherley]], begun in 1839 in [[Hampshire]], England. The former proved a remarkable success for three-and-a-half years until the proprietor, having ruined himself by gambling, had to sell his interest in the enterprise. Tytherley, known as Harmony Hall, or Queenwood College, was designed by the architect Joseph Hansom.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Penelope, "The Architectural Achievement of Joseph Aloysius Hansom (1803-1882), Designer of the Hansom Cab, Birmingham Town Hall, and Churches of the Catholic Revival", The Edwin Mellen Press, 2010, p.75 {{ISBN|0-7734-3851-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also failed.

==Return to Britain==

Although Owen made brief visits to the United States, London became his permanent home and the centre of his activities in 1828. After an extended period of friction with William Allen and some of his other business partners, Owen relinquished all of connections to New Lanark.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Estabrook68/&gt; He is often quoted as comment Allen at the time, "All the world is queer save thee and me, and even thou art a little queer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/1828?cat=technology#human_rights_social_justice |title=1828: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=13 July 2009}} See also: {{cite web|url=http://www.online-literature.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18866 |title=Who said this: "all strange but thee and Me" – Literature Network Forums |publisher=Online-literature.com |date= |accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having invested most of his personal fortune in the failed New Harmony communal experiment, Owen was no longer a wealthy capitalist; however, he remained the head of a vigorous propaganda effort to promote industrial equality, free education for children, and adequate living conditions in factory towns. In addition, he delivered lectures in Europe and published a weekly newspaper to gain support for his ideas.&lt;ref name=Estabrook68/&gt;

In 1832 Owen opened the [[National Equitable Labour Exchange]] system,&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[time-based currency]] in which the exchange of goods was effected by means of labour notes; this system superseded the usual means of exchange and middlemen. The London exchange continued until 1833; a Birmingham branch operated for only a few months until July 1833.
&lt;ref name=UnionHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline|publisher=TUC History Online|url=http://www.unionhistory.info/timeline/Tl_Display.php?Where=Dc1Title+contains+%27National+Equitable+Labour+Exchange+notes%2C+1832+%28front%29%27+|accessdate=30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen also became involved in trade unionism. He briefly served as the leader of the [[Grand National Consolidated Trades Union|Grand National Consolidated Trade Union (GNCTU)]] before its collapse in 1834.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;

Socialism first became current in British terminology in the discussions of the [[Association of all Classes of all Nations]], which Owen formed in 1835&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Royle |year=1998 |title=Robert Owen and the Commencement of the Millennium|page=56|publisher=Manchester University Press|ISBN=0-7190-5426-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as its initial leader.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, ''Robert Owen'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen's [[secularism|secular]] views also gained enough influence among the working classes to cause the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' to comment in 1839 that his principles were the actual creed of a great portion of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. |date=1839|title=A letter to the Earl of Durham on Reform in Parliament, by Paying the Elected|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sthMAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|journal=London and Westminster Review|volume=32|pages=475–508|accessdate=30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dowd /&gt; However, by 1846, the only long-lasting result of Owen's agitation for social change, carried on through public meetings, pamphlets, periodicals, and occasional treatises, remained the [[cooperative|co-operative]] movement, and for a time even that seemed to have utterly collapsed.&lt;ref name=AdventuresSocialism /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dowd /&gt;&lt;ref name=WeekesThesis /&gt;

==Role in spiritualism==
[[File:Tomb of Robert Owen (1771-1858) - geograph.org.uk - 661997.jpg|thumb|260px|Tomb of Robert Owen, [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]], Powys]]

In 1817, Owen publicly claimed that all religions were false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Richard William Leopold,  | title =Robert Dale Owen, A Biography | publisher = Harvard University Press | series =Harvard Historical Studies | volume =45 | edition = | year =1940 | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| page=8 | url = | OCLC=774894}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, at the age of 83, Owen converted to [[spiritualism]] after a series of [[Séance|sittings]] with [[Maria B. Hayden]], the American medium  who is credited with introducing spiritualism to England. Owen made a public profession of his new faith in his publication ''The Rational Quarterly Review'' and in ''The future of the Human race; or great glorious and future revolution to be effected through the agency of departed spirits of good and superior men and women'', a pamphlet that he also wrote.&lt;ref name=Spence679/&gt;

Owen claimed to have had mediumistic contact with the spirits of [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and others. He explained that the purpose of these communications was to change "the present, false, disunited and miserable state of human existence, for a true, united and happy state&amp;nbsp;... to prepare the world for universal peace, and to infuse into all the spirit of charity, forbearance and love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Podmore|title=Robert Owen: A Biography|volume=II|pages=604–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spiritualists]] have claimed that after Owen's death his spirit dictated to the medium [[Emma Hardinge Britten]] in 1871 the "[[Emma Hardinge Britten|Seven Principles of Spiritualism]]," which the Spiritualists' National Union used as "the basis of its religious philosoply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snui.org/index.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=9 |title=History of Spiritualism|publisher=SNU international| format = | accessdate =30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
As Owen grew older and more radical in his views, his influence began to decline.&lt;ref name=Estabrook68&gt;Estabrook, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen published his memoirs, ''The Life of Robert Owen'' (1857), a year prior to his death.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Crowd of people congregated by the grave of Robert Owen at the old parish church, Newtown (1293839).jpg|thumb|260px|Crowds of locals gather to commemorate Robert Owen at his grave in Newtown, 1890s]]

Although he had spent the majority of his life in England and Scotland, Owen returned to his native village of Newtown at the end of his life. He died at Newtown on 17 November 1858, and was buried there on 21 November. With the exception of an annual income drawn from a trust established by his sons in 1844, Owen died penniless.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, ''Robert Dale Owen, A Biography'', p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen was a reformer, philanthropist, community builder, and spiritualist who spent his adult life seeking to improve the lives of others. An advocate of the working class, he improved working conditions of factory workers, which he successfully demonstrated at New Lanark, Scotland; became a leader in trade unionism; promoted social equality through his experimental utopian communities; and supported passage of child labour laws and free education for children.&lt;ref name=Estabrook68/&gt;

Owen was ahead of his time as a social reformer. He offered his vision for a communal society that others could consider and apply as they wished.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race'' (1849), Owen further elaborated that character is formed by a combination of Nature or God and the circumstances of the individual's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert Owen | title =Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race, or, The Coming Change from Irrationality to Rationality | publisher =Effingham Wilson | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1849 | location =London | pages =1, 9 | url =  | OCLC=11756751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the beneficial results achieved at New Lanark, Scotland, during his thirty years of work in the community, Owen concluded that a person's "character is not made ''by'', but ''for'' the individual,"&lt;ref&gt;Owen, ''Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race'', p. 29. See also: Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and that nature and society are responsible for each person's character and conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, ''Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen's agitation for social change and the Owenites whose work he inspired, including the efforts of his own children, helped to establish and promote long-lasting social reforms in the area of women's and workers' rights; the establishment of free public libraries and museums; childcare and public, co-educational schools; pre-Marxian communism; and the development of the [[cooperative]] and the trade union movement. New Harmony, Indiana, and New Lanark, Scotland, the two towns with which he is most closely associated, remain as lasting reminders of his efforts.&lt;ref name=GS269-70/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Branigin, "Robert Owen's New Harmony" in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', pp. 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen's legacy of public service continued with his four sons, Robert Dale, William, David Dale, and Richard Dale, and his daughter, Jane, who followed him to America to live at New Harmony, Indiana:
*[[Robert Dale Owen]] (1801–1877), an able exponent of his father's doctrines, managed the New Harmony community after his father returned to Britain in 1825. In addition, he wrote articles and co-edited with [[Frances Wright]] the ''New-Harmony Gazette'' in the late 1820s in Indiana and the ''Free Enquirer'' in the 1830s in [[New York City]]. Owen returned to New Harmony in 1833 and became active in Indiana politics. He was elected to the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] (1836–39 and 1851–53) and [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] (1843–47), and appointed as 1853–58) to [[Naples]]. While serving as a member of [[United States Congress|Congress]], he drafted and helped to secure passage of the bill that founded the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1846. He was elected as a delegate to the [[Constitution of Indiana#Constitutional Convention 2|Indiana Constitutional Convention]] in 1850,&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;&lt;ref name=Estabrook72-74&gt;Estabrook, pp. 72–74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| title =Owen, Robert Dale (1801–1877) | work =Biographical Directory of the United States Congress | publisher =U.S. Congress | date = | url =http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=O000152 | format = | accessdate =12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| title =Owen, Robert Dale (1801–1877) | work =Biographical Directory of the United States Congress | publisher =U.S. Congress | date = | url =http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=O000152 | format = | accessdate =September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued in support of widows and married women's property and divorce rights. Owen also favoured legislation for Indiana's tax-supported public school system.&lt;ref name=Traces12/&gt; He later succeeded in passing a state law giving. Like his father, Robert Dale Owe believed in [[spiritualism]], authoring two books on the subject: ''Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World'' (1859) and ''The Debatable Land Between this World and the Next'' (1872).&lt;ref name=Estabrook72/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
*William Owen (1802–1842) came to the United States with his father in 1824.  Because of his business acumen, especially his knowledge of cotton-goods manufacturing, he remained at New Harmony after his father returned to Scotland, and served as an adviser to the community. He also organised New Harmony's Thespian Society in 1827.

The linguistic evidence has indisputably shown that roots of Romani language lie in India: the language has grammatical characteristics of Indian languages and shares with them a big part of the basic lexicon, for example, body parts or daily routines.&lt;ref name="mluvnice"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Šebková | first1 = Hana | last2 = Žlnayová | first2 = Edita | year = 1998 | url = http://rss.archives.ceu.hu/archive/00001112/01/118.pdf | title = Nástin mluvnice slovenské romštiny (pro pedagogické účely) | place = Ústí nad Labem | publisher = Pedagogická fakulta Univerzity J.

More exactly, Romani shares the basic lexicon with [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. It shares many phonetic features with [[Marwari (language)|Marwari]], while its grammar is closest to [[Bengali language|Bengali]].&lt;ref name="hub1995"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Milena|last=Hübschmannová|title=Romaňi čhib – romština: Několik základních informací o romském jazyku|journal=Bulletin Muzea romské kultury|issue=4/1995|year= 1995 |publisher= Muzeum romské kultury|place=Brno|quote=Zatímco romská lexika je bližší hindštině, marvárštině, pandžábštině atd., v gramatické sféře nacházíme mnoho shod s východoindickým jazykem, s bengálštinou.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic findings in 2012 suggest the Romani originated in northwestern India and migrated as a group.&lt;ref name="IsabelMendizabal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.livescience.com/40652-facts-about-roma-romani-gypsies.html|title=5 Intriguing Facts About the Roma|work=Live Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a genetic study in 2012, the ancestors of present scheduled tribes and scheduled caste populations of [[North India|northern]] [[India]], traditionally referred to collectively as the [[Ḍoma]], are the likely ancestral populations of modern European Roma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Rai | first1 = N | last2 = Chaubey | first2 = G | last3 = Tamang | first3 = R | last4 = Pathak | first4 = AK | last5 = Singh | first5 = VK | year = 2012 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0048477 | title = The Phylogeography of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup H1a1a-M82 Reveals the Likely Indian Origin of the European Romani Populations | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | number = 11 | page = e48477 | DOI = 10.1371/journal.pone.0048477 | pmid=23209554 | pmc=3509117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, during the International Roma Conference, the [[Minister of External Affairs (India)|Indian Minister of External Affairs]] stated that the people of the Roma community were children of India. The conference ended with a recommendation to the [[Government of India]] to recognize the Roma community spread across 30 countries as a part of the [[Indian diaspora]].&lt;ref name="diaspora"&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Romas be part of Indian diaspora?|publisher=khaleejtimes.com|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/international/india/can-romas-be-part-of-indian-diaspora|date=29 February 2016|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migration to Canada during the 1990s===
When Romani [[refugee]]s were allowed into [[Canada]] in 1997, a protest was staged by 25 people, including [[neo-Nazi]]s, in front of the motel where the refugees were staying. The protesters held signs that said, for examples, "Honk if you hate Gypsies," "Canada is not a Trash Can," and "G.S.T. — Gypsies Suck Tax." (The last is a reference to Canada's [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]], also known as GST.)  The protesters were charged with promoting hatred, and the case, ''[[R. v. Krymowski]]'', reached the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;''[[R. v. Krymowski]]'' [2005] 1 S.C.R. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the influx of over 3,000 [[Roma in the Czech Republic|Czech Romani]] refugees to Canada in 1997 a community center was opened in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]. The Roma Community Centre is a non-profit organization  that is dedicated to providing community support to the [[Romani people]] in Canada. The organization was founded in 1997.  The centre has also provided assistance to Romani refugees from the former [[Yugoslavia]] ([[Roma in Serbia|Serbia]], [[Roma in Croatia|Croatia]],  [[Roma in the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], Montenegro, [[Romani people in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], Slovenia, [[Roma in Kosovo|Kosovo]]), [[Roma in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], [[Roma in Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Roma in Hungary|Hungary]], [[Roma in Romania|Romania]], [[Roma in Albania|Albania]], [[Roma in Ukraine|Ukraine]], [[Roma in Poland|Poland]], [[Roma in Portugal|Portugal]], [[Roma in Greece|Greece]], [[Roma in Ireland|Ireland]], [[Roma in Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and other countries with Roma populations. These refugees claim to be fleeing [[Antiziganism|discrimination and persecution]] in Europe. The centre has also denounced pejorative statements about Romani people in the Canadian media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/09/25/bernie-m-farber-et-al-hating-the-jew-hating-the-gypsy/ |title=Hating the Jew, hating the 'gypsy' |publisher=''[[National Post]]'' |accessdate=2012-12-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130130051224/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/09/25/bernie-m-farber-et-al-hating-the-jew-hating-the-gypsy/ |archivedate=2013-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has denounced [[antisemitism]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjnews.com/index.php?q=node/95581 |title=Roma centre distances itself from anti-Israel protest |publisher=''[[Canadian Jewish News]]'' |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent===
Starting in 2008, [[Roma in Hungary|Roma immigration]] from [[Hungary]] began to increase.&lt;ref name="CBC1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/hungarian-roma-hope-for-sanctuary-in-canada-1.1169996 |title=Hungarian Roma hope for sanctuary in Canada - World - CBC News |website=Cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year Hungary fell into recession, and violence and discrimination against Roma increased.&lt;ref name="CBC1"/&gt; Many Roma in Hungary live in squalor. In 2011 Roma asylum seekers from Hungary numbered 4,400, but most of these claims were either rejected or withdrawn. Immigration Minister Jason Kenney was quoted as saying in 2012 "If they subsequently withdraw their own claim, they’re telling us that in fact they don’t need Canada’s protection, that they’re not victims of persecution, and that’s… a bogus claim. It’s a fake claim."&lt;ref name="CBC1"/&gt;

The government has since pushed to reduce Hungarian Roma immigration. In December 2012, Hungary was added to a list of "Safe Countries", which would make refugee claims harder.&lt;ref name="Globeandmail1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Valentina Jovanovski |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawas-crackdown-on-roma-refugees-has-hungarians-seeking-asylum-elsewhere/article13627652/ |title=Ottawa’s crackdown on Roma refugees has Hungarians seeking asylum elsewhere |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date= |accessdate=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, 2012, prominent Canadian commentator [[Ezra Levant]] broadcast a commentary "The Jew vs. the Gypsies" on ''The Source'' in which he accused the [[Romani people]] of being a group of criminals saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;These are gypsies, a culture synonymous with swindlers. The phrase gypsy and cheater have been so interchangeable historically that the word has entered the English language as a verb: he gypped me. Well the gypsies have gypped us. Too many have come here as false refugees. And they come here to gyp us again and rob us blind as they have done in Europe for centuries … They’re gypsies. And one of the central characteristics of that culture is that their chief economy is theft and begging.&lt;ref name=jsource&gt;{{cite news|title=Hate crime investigation launched surrounding Ezra Levant’s Roma broadcast|url=http://j-source.ca/article/hate-crime-investigation-launched-surrounding-ezra-levant%E2%80%99s-roma-broadcast|accessdate=October 25, 2012|newspaper=J-source (The Canadian Journalism Foundation )|date=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2013, Levant apologized for his remarks, stating that "I attacked a particular group, and painted them all with the same brush. And to those I hurt, I'm sorry" and expressed hope that this "will serve as an example of what not to do when commenting on social issues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ca.news.yahoo.com/blogs/dailybrew/ezra-levant-issues-air-apology-roma-comments-144145323.html Ezra Levant issues on-air apology for Roma comments] by Matthew Coutts, ''Daily Brew'', March 19, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/03/18/ezra-levant-roma-apology-_n_2903534.html Ezra Levant Apologizes For Roma Comments (VIDEO)] by Lauren Strapagiel, ''The Huffington Post Canada'', March 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/straighttalk/archives/2013/03/20130318-180525.html Collective judgement is a moral mistake] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919162142/http://www.sunnewsnetwork.ca/sunnews/straighttalk/archives/2013/03/20130318-180525.html |date=2013-09-19 }} by Ezra Levant, ''Sun News'', March 18th, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC) subsequently ruled, in September 2013, that Levant's broadcast was “in violation of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters’ Code of Ethics and Equitable Portrayal Code,” and that his comments about the Roma were "abusive and unduly discriminatory against an ethnic group, and violated other provisions of the [code] regarding negative portrayal, stereotyping, stigmatization and degradation." The council noted that Levant had already issued two on-air apologies, and as such, he would not be ordered to issue another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ezra Levant's ‘Gypsies' Comments Condemned By Broadcast Standards Council|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/09/10/ezra-levant-gypsies-sun-news_n_3901760.html|accessdate=September 10, 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2013/130909.php CANADIAN BROADCAST STANDARDS COUNCIL: Sun News Network re The Source (Theft Ring) (CBSC Decision 12/13-0069+)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910042652/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2013/130909.php |date=2013-09-10 }} Issued September 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rukun Tetangga''' (RT) is the division of villages in [[Indonesia]] under ''[[Rukun Warga]]''. RT is the lowest administrative division of Indonesia.

Rukun Tetangga is through consultation in the framework of community service &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article106972081 |title=Self-help street by street |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=41, |issue=11,769 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=17 August 1967 |accessdate=15 July 2016 |page=19 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  set by the village or villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Jakarta Raya (Indonesia).

The local level of governance of Rukun Warga and Rukun Tetangga also includes the Rukun Kampung &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Suwarno, P.

Rukun Tetangga chaired by the ''Ketua RT'' elected by its citizens. A RT consists of a number of houses or households(''KK'').

Most information about governance and functioning of the RT and RW is in Indonesian&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Jakarta Raya (Indonesia).

'''Saisiyat''' (sometimes spelled '''Saisiat''') is the language of the [[Saisiyat people|Saisiyat]], a [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese indigenous people]]. It is a [[Formosan language]] of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family. It has approximately 4,750 speakers.

==Distribution==
The language area of Saisiyat is small, situated in the northwest of the country between the [[Hakka Chinese]] and [[Atayal language|Atayal]] regions in the mountains ([[Wufeng, Hsinchu]]; [[Nanzhuang|Nanchuang]] and [[Shitan, Miaoli|Shitan]], [[Miaoli County|Miaoli]]).
 
There are two main dialects: Ta'ai (North Saisiyat) and Tungho (South Saisiyat). Ta'ai is spoken in Miao-Li and Tungho is spoken in Hsinchu.
 
[[Kulon language|Kulon]], an extinct Formosan language, is closely related to Saisiyat but is considered by Taiwanese linguist [[Paul Jen-kuei Li]] to be a separate language.

==Usage==
Today, one thousand [[Saisiyat people]] do not use the Saisiyat language. Many young people use [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] or [[Atayal language|Atayal]] instead, and few children speak Saisiyat. [[Hakka language|Hakka Chinese]] speakers, Atayal speakers and Saisiyat speakers live more or less together. Many Saisiyat are able to speak Saisiyat, Hakka, Atayal, [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], and, sometimes, [[Min Nan]] as well. Although Saisiyat has a relatively large number of speakers, the language is [[endangered language|endangered]].

==Grammar==

===Syntax===
Although it also allows for verb-initial constructions,&lt;ref&gt;Li, Paul Jen-kuei. 1998. "台灣南島語言 [The Austronesian Languages of Taiwan]." In Li, Paul Jen-kuei. 2004. Selected Papers on Formosan Languages. Taipei, Taiwan: Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica.&lt;/ref&gt; Saisiyat is a strongly subject-initial language (i.e., SVO), and is shifting to an [[accusative language]], while it still has many features of [[split ergativity]] (Hsieh &amp; Huang 2006:91). [[Pazeh language|Pazeh]] and [[Thao language|Thao]], also [[Northern Formosan languages]], are the only other [[Formosan languages]] that allow for SVO constructions.
 
Saisiyat's case-marking system distinguishes between personal and common nouns (Hsieh &amp; Huang 2006:93).

'''[[Serbs]]''' ({{lang-de|Serben in Deutschland}}; {{lang-sr|Срби у Немачкој}}/''Srbi u Nemačkoj'') are the seventh largest group of foreigners in Germany.&lt;ref name="destatis"/&gt; Most Serbs living in Germany moved during the 1960s and 1970s as ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' or "Guest workers" when [[Serbia]] was part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. A small percentage of Serbs migrated to Germany as refugees during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] of the 1990s.
[[File:Staatsangehörigkeit Serbien in Deutschland.png|thumb|left|Distribution of Serbian nationals in Germany.]]
==Demographics==
The majority (64%) of the Serbian population is concentrated in three federal states: [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Baden-Württemberg]] and [[Bavaria]]. Within the three states the Serbs are numerous in [[Düsseldorf]], [[Stuttgart]] and especially [[Munich]].&lt;ref name=GS&gt;{{cite book|title=The Germany-Serbia Remittance Corridor: Challenges of Establishing a Formal Money Transfer System|author1=de Luna-Martinez, J.|author2=Endo, I.|author3=Barberis, C.|date=2006|publisher=World Bank|isbn=9780821366592|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=mcZyu1EZy6QC|accessdate=2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulm]] had the highest share of migrants from Serbia in 2011 according to German Census data. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kartenseite.wordpress.com/2017/03/26/serben-in-deutschland-landkreise/ |title=Kartenseite: Serben in Deutschland - Landkreise |publisher=kartenseite.wordpress.com |date=2017-03-26 |accessdate=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; But a considerable part of the Serbian Migrants was not included, because it still went under former nationalities ([[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], [[Serbia and Montenegro]], Serbia until 2008) at the time of the census.
According to the [[Federal Statistical Office of Germany|Federal Statistical Office]], at the end of 2015 the number of foreigners with Serbian nationality in Germany stood at 230,427. Another 29,785 foreigners living in Germany with the citizenship of the former [[Serbia and Montenegro]] have not yet decided on one of the possible new citizenships.&lt;ref name="destatis"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/Publikationen/Thematisch/Bevoelkerung/MigrationIntegration/AuslaendBevoelkerung2010200157004.pdf?__blob=publicationFile |title=Statistisches Bundesamt: Bevölkerung und Erwerbstätigkeit - Ausländische Bevölkerung - Ergebnisse des Ausländerzentralregisters |access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="destatis" /&gt;

'''Shuar''', which literally means "people", also known by such (now derogatory) terms as '''Chiwaro''', '''Jibaro, Jivaro, or Xivaro''', is an indigenous language spoken in the Southeastern jungle of the [[Morona-Santiago Province]] and [[Pastaza Province]] in [[Ecuador]].

== History ==
Twelve Indigenous languages of [[Ecuador]] are spoken today, one of which is [[Shuar people|Shuar.]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saving Languages: An introduction to language revitilization|last=Grenoble|first=Lenore A|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-521-81621-2|location=New York|pages=78–83|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the past four decades, the Shuar language has been noted for its link with several political groups.

The name “Shuar” shared among the people and their language was first revealed to the Spaniards in the 17th century. The Shuar language, as it stands today, is considered part of the Jivaroan language tree, and embodies one of the most well-known tribal groups in the Amazonian jungle region.&lt;ref name==":0"&gt;{{Cite website|title=The Shuar, a Forgotten Indigenous Community in Ecuador.|last=Unrepresented Nations and People Organization (UNPO)}}[http://www.unpo.org/article/20214]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radio schools ==
The geographical remoteness within the Ecuadorian rainforest isolates the Shuar and has widely scattered the people from one another. As a result, in the late 1960s, radio schools were formed to promote communication and education in both Spanish and Shuar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This inadvertently transformed into a [[language revitalization]] initiative for the [[Shuar people]]. Radio schools were shut down in 2001 and replaced with formal bilingual in-class teaching.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{slavery}}

The continent of [[Africa]] is one of the regions most rife with [[contemporary slavery]].
[[Slavery in Africa]] has a long history, within Africa since before historical records, but intensifying with the [[Arab slave trade]] and again with the  [[trans-Atlantic slave trade]]; the demand for slaves created an entire [[Sahelian kingdoms|series of kingdoms]] (such as the [[Ashanti Empire]]) which existed in a state of [[perpetual warfare]] in order to generate the prisoners of war necessary for the lucrative export of slaves. These patterns have persisted into the  [[colonial Africa|colonial period]] during the late 19th and early 20th century. Although the colonial authorities attempted to suppress slavery from about 1900, this had very limited success, and after [[decolonization]], slavery continues in many parts of Africa even though being technically illegal.

Slavery in the [[Sahel]] region (and to a lesser extent the [[Horn of Africa]]), exist along the [[race (classification of humans)|racial]] and cultural boundary of [[Arabized Berber]]s in the north and darker Africans in the south.&lt;ref&gt;"The mobilization of local ideas about racial difference has been important in generating, and intensifying, civil wars that have occurred since the end of colonial rule in all of the countries that straddle the southern edge of the Sahara Desert. [...] contemporary conflicts often hearken back to an older history in which blackness could be equated with slavery and non-blackness with predatory and uncivilized banditry." (cover text), Hall, Bruce S., ''A History of Race in Muslim West Africa, 1600-1960''. Cambridge University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
Slavery in the [[Sahel]] states of [[Slavery in Mauritania|Mauritania]], [[Slavery in Mali|Mali]], [[slavery in Niger|Niger]], [[slavery in Chad|Chad]] and [[Slavery in Sudan|Sudan]] in particular, continues a centuries-old pattern of hereditary servitude.
Other forms of traditional slavery exist in parts of [[Human trafficking in Ghana|Ghana]], [[Human trafficking in Benin|Benin]], [[Human trafficking in Togo|Togo]] and [[Human trafficking in Nigeria|Nigeria]].
There are other, non-traditional forms of slavery in Africa today, mostly involving [[human trafficking]] and the enslavement of [[child soldiers]] and [[child labour]]ers, e.g. [[human trafficking in Angola]], and  human [[trafficking of children]] from [[Human trafficking in Togo|Togo]], [[Human trafficking in Benin|Benin]] and [[Human trafficking in Nigeria|Nigeria]] to  [[Human trafficking in Gabon|Gabon]] and [[Human trafficking in Cameroon|Cameroon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/niger.htm Traditional Slavery in Niger], [[Anti-Slavery International]], Society's Secretary-General broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on March 9, 2005 at 9.30 pm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern day slavery in Africa  according to the [[Anti-Slavery Society]] includes exploitation of subjugate populations even when their condition is not technically called "slavery":
{{Quotation|Although this exploitation is often not called slavery, the conditions are the same. People are sold like objects, forced to work for little or no pay and are at the mercy of their "employers".|Anti=Slavery Society|Antislavery Society| What is Modern Slavery}}
Forced labor in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] is estimated at 660,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ituc-csi.org/IMG/pdf/mapEN.pdf |title=Workers' Alliance against Forced Labour and Trafficking - ITUC |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes people involved in the illegal diamond mines of [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]], which is also a direct result of the civil war in these regions.&lt;ref name="ForcedLabour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antislavery.org/english/slavery_today/forced_labour/ |title=Forced Labour |publisher=[[Anti-Slavery International]] |location=[[London]] |accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex trade===
{{Main|Sex slavery}}
While institutional slavery has been banned worldwide, there are numerous reports of female sex slaves in areas without an effective government control, such as Sudan and [[Liberia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6264200.stm Africa | Liberia's Taylor appears in court].

===Forced labour===
Forced labor is defined as any work or services which people are forced to do against their will under the threat of some form of punishment. Forced labor  was used to an overwhelming extent in King Leopold's Congo Free State and on Portuguese plantations of [[Cape Verde]] and [[São Tomé]]. Today in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] the [[Pygmy peoples|indigenous people]] are usually victims of their [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] neighbors, who have replaced the positions once held by Europeans.&lt;ref name="ForcedLabour"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alistair Boddy-Evans African History Expert |url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/slavery/p/SlaveryTypes.htm |title=BBC Types of Slavery in Africa |publisher=Africanhistory.about.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quotation|"We must work for the Bantu masters.  We cannot refuse to do so because we are likely to be beaten or be victims of insults and threats.  Even though we agree to work all day in the fields, we are still asked to work even more, for example, to fetch firewood or go hunting.  Most of the time, they pay us in kind, a worn loincloth for 10 workdays. We cannot refuse because we do not have a choice.”|Anti=Slavery Society|Antislavery Society| Interview with an [[Pygmy peoples|indigenous man]] in the Congo}}

=== Child slave trade ===
{{further|Human trafficking in Nigeria|Human trafficking in Benin|Human trafficking in Togo}}
The trading of children has been reported in modern [[Nigeria]] and [[Benin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/africa/412628.stm|title=BBC News - AFRICA - West Africa's child slave trade|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children are kidnapped or purchased for $20 – $70 each by slavers in poorer states, such as Benin and Togo, and sold into slavery in sex dens or as unpaid domestic servants for $350.00 each in wealthier oil-rich states, such as Nigeria and Gabon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20855855-28737,00.html |title=West is master of slave trade guilt |publisher=Theaustralian.news.com.au |date= |accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gvnet.com/humantrafficking/Nigeria.htm|title=Human Trafficking &amp; Modern-day Slavery - Nigeria|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, [[Boko Haram]] kidnapped 276 female students from [[Chibok]], Borno. More than 50 of them soon escaped, but the remainder have not been released. Instead 
, the leader of Boko Haram, [[Abubakar Shekau]], who has a reward of $7 million offered by the [[United States Department of State]] since June 2013 for information leading to his capture, announced his intention of selling them into [[slavery]].

=== Ritual slavery ===
{{Main|Ritual servitude}}
'''Ritual servitude''' (Trokosi) is a practice in [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], and [[Benin]] where traditional religious shrines  take human beings, usually young virgin girls in payment for services, or in religious atonement for alleged misdeeds of a family member—almost always a female.{{cn|date=September 2015}} In Ghana and in Togo, it is practiced by the Ewe people in the Volta region, and in Benin it is practiced by the Fon.&lt;ref&gt;FAQ About the Form of Slavery Called Trokosi, ECM Publications, 2002, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery by country==

===Chad===
{{main|Slavery in Chad}}
The practice of slavery in Chad, as in the Sahel states in general, is an entrenched phenomenon with a long history, going back to the Arab slave trade in the Sahelian kingdoms, and it continues today. As elsewhere in West Africa, the situation reflects an ethnic, racial and religious rifts. [[IRIN]] (Integrated Regional Information Networks) of the [[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] reports children being sold to Arab herdsmen in [[Chad]] by their parents due to poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=52490|title=IRIN Africa - CHAD: Children sold into slavery for the price of a calf - Chad - Children - Economy - Governance - Human Rights|work=IRINnews|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=2004-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congo===
[[Debt bondage]]-like slavery is rife in parts of Congo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.longreads.com/2016/03/08/your-phone-was-made-by-slaves-a-primer-on-the-secret-economy/|title=Your Phone Was Made By Slaves: A Primer on the Secret Economy|website=Longreads Blog|access-date=2016-03-28|date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethiopia===
{{main|Human trafficking in Ethiopia}}
Mahider Bitew, Children's Rights and Protection expert at the [[Women in Ethiopia|Ministry of Women's Affairs]], says that some remote studies conducted in [[Dire Dawa]], [[Shashemene]], [[Awassa]], and three other towns of the country indicate that the problem of child trafficking is very serious. According to a 2003 study, about one thousand children were trafficked via Dire Dawa to countries of the [[Middle East]]. The majority of those children were girls, most of whom were forced to be prostitutes after leaving the country. The [[International Labour Organization]] has identified prostitution as the worst form of child labor.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

In [[Ethiopia]], children are trafficked into [[prostitution]], to provide cheap or unpaid labor, and to work as domestic servants or beggars. The ages of these children are usually between 10 and 18, and their trafficking is from the country to urban centers and from cities to the country. Boys are often expected to work in activities such as herding cattle in rural areas and in the weaving industry in [[Addis Ababa]] and other major towns. Girls are expected to take responsibilities for domestic chores, childcare, and looking after the sick, and to work as prostitutes.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

===Ghana, Togo, Benin===
{{main|Human trafficking in Ghana|Human trafficking in Benin|Human trafficking in Togo}}
In parts of [[Ghana]] among the [[Ewe people]], a family may be punished for an offense by having to turn over a virgin female to serve as a sex slave within the offended family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos-sexisme.org/English/slavery.htm|title=Slavery in Ghana|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, the woman does not gain the title of "wife". In parts of Ghana, [[Togo]], and [[Benin]], shrine slavery persists, despite being illegal in Ghana since 1998. This system of slavery is sometimes called [[Ritual servitude|trokosi]] (in Ghana), or [[Ritual servitude|voodoosi]] in Togo and Benin, or ritual servitude. Young virgin girls are given as slaves in traditional shrines and are used sexually by the priests, in addition to providing free labor for the shrine.&lt;ref name="Ghana's trapped slaves"/&gt;

Many Chinese prostitutes are trafficked to Ghana to service expatriate communities in the country, the enslavement protection Alliance west Africa (EPAWA) investigation reveal.
Accra-based non-governmental organization told citi news victims are recruited under the guise of working as restaurant assistants. They are then confined and forced to provide sexual services.

===Madagascar===
Domestic servitude and forced labor are a continuing problem and increasing as a result of exacerbated poverty in Madagascar, according to a 2012 mission by the United Nations Special Rapporteur for contemporary forms of slavery. The UN Special Rapporteur identified children as particularly vulnerable and was particularly concerned about the enslavement of youth in mining and sexual exploitation or servile marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madagascar: "Poverty and impunity have increased contemporary forms of slavery," warns UN Expert|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12902&amp;LangID=E|publisher=UN Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights|accessdate=20 February 2013|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mali===
{{main|Slavery in Mali}}
Slavery continues to exist in Mali in all ethnic groups of the country but particularly among the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] communities. The French formally abolished slavery in 1905, but many slaves remained with their masters until 1946 when large emancipation activism occurred.&lt;ref name=Mauxion&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mauxion|first=Aurelien|title=Moving to Stay: ''Iklan'' Spatial Strategies Towards Socioeconomic Emancipation in Northern Mali, 1898-1960|journal=The Journal of African History|year=2012|volume=53|issue=2|pages=195–213|url=|doi=10.1017/s0021853712000394}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first government of independent Mali tried to end slavery, but these efforts were undermined with the military dictatorship from 1968 until 1991. Slavery persists today with thousands of people still held in servitude; however, an active social movement called [[Temedt]] (which won the 2012 [[Anti-Slavery International]] award) has been pressuring the government for ending slavery in the country.&lt;ref name=Hahonou&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hahonou|first1=Eric|last2=Pelckmans|first2=Lotte|title=West African Antislavery Movements: Citizenship Struggles and the Legacies of Slavery|journal=Stichproben.

Although the Malian government denies that slavery continues, ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' writer Kira Salak claimed in 2002 that slavery was quite conspicuous and that she herself bought and then freed two slaves in [[Timbuktu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1206_021205_salakkayak.html Kayaking to Timbuktu, Writer Sees Slave Trade, More]; Handwerk, Brian; December 5, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, with the [[Tuareg rebellion (2012)|2012 Tuareg Rebellion]], there are reports of ex-slaves being recaptured by their former masters.&lt;ref name=Tran /&gt;

===Mauritania===
{{main|Slavery in Mauritania}}

A system exists now by which [[Arab Muslims]]—the bidanes—own black slaves, the [[haratin]]es. An estimated 90,000 Mauritanians remain essentially enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/projects/fse/muslim/slavery.html|title=Essays - The Feminist Sexual Ethics Project - Brandeis University|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling bidanes (the name means literally white-skinned people) are descendants of the [[Sanhaja]] [[Berber people|Berbers]] and [[Beni Hassan]] Arab tribes who emigrated  to northwest [[Africa]] and present-day [[Western Sahara]] and [[Mauritania]] during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=70522|title=IRIN Africa - MAURITANIA: Fair elections haunted by racial imbalance - Mauritania - Governance - Human Rights|work=IRINnews|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some estimates, up to 600,000 Mauritanians, or 20% of the population, are still enslaved, many of them used as [[bonded labour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1458_abolition/page4.shtml|title=BBC World Service - The Abolition season on BBC World Service|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery in Mauritania was criminalized in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6938032.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Africa - Mauritanian MPs pass slavery law|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malouma Messoud, a former Muslim slave has explained her enslavement to a religious leader:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We didn't learn this history in school; we simply grew up within this [[social hierarchy]] and lived it. Slaves believe that if they do not obey their masters, they will not go to paradise. They are raised in a social and religious system that everyday reinforces this idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.jhunewsletter.com/media/storage/paper932/news/2003/12/05/News/Smir-Talk.Exposes.Modern.Slavery-2245765.shtml  The [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] News-letter 'SMIR talk exposes modern slavery' - Brendan Schreiber and Maria Andrawis, 5 December 2003]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; "&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Mauritania]], despite slave ownership having been banned by law in 1981, hereditary slavery continues.&lt;ref&gt;"The last law, in 1981, banned it but failed to criminalise it. However much it is denied, an ancient system of bondage, with slaves passed on from generation to generation, still plainly exists." [http://www.economist.com/world/africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_JTNNRGS ''Steady progress in Mali and Mauritania'',] [[The Economist]]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, according to [[Amnesty International]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Not only has the government denied the existence of slavery and failed to respond to cases brought to its attention, it has hampered the activities of organizations which are working on the issue, including by refusing to grant them official recognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4091579.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Africa - Slavery: Mauritania's best kept secret|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Imam El Hassan Ould Benyamin of Tayarat in 1997 expressed his views about earlier proclamations ending slavery in his country as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;"[it] is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Quran ... [and] amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their goods; goods that were acquired legally. The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave."&lt;ref&gt;Segal, p.206, in "Islam's Black Slaves: The Other Black Diaspora," quoted by Suzy Hansen of Salon.com on 5 April 2001 - {{cite web |url=http://archive.salon.com/books/int/2001/04/05/segal/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301113533/http://archive.salon.com/books/int/2001/04/05/segal/index.html |archivedate=1 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }} .

[[Biram Dah Abeid]] often called the Mauritanian Nelson Mandela, “Le Spartacus Mauritanien”,&lt;ref name="unpo.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unpo.org/article/17820|title=UNPO: A Look at Mauritania's Troubled History of Slavery|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an anti-slavery activists and member of the Haratin ethnic group in Mauritania argues that &lt;blockquote&gt;there is a kind of informal coalition — Beydanes [the slave owning caste], the state, police, judges, and imams — that prevents slaves from leaving their masters. “Whenever a slave breaks free while IRA [his antislavery group] is not aware and not present, police officers and judges help Arab-Berbers to intimidate the slave until he returns in submission.”&lt;ref name=NYER-2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=OKEOWO|first1=ALEXIS|title=Freedom Fighter|journal=The New Yorker|date=8 September 2014|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/08/freedom-fighter|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Biram, along with 16 other activists, since 11 November 2014, is awaiting trial in Mauritania on multiple charges which include  “violating public order” and “offending the authorities”.&lt;ref name="unpo.org"/&gt;

The story of [[Biram Dah Abeid]], a prominent anti-slavery activist on trial, illustrates the troubled history and continued prevalence of slavery in Mauritania. Yet, Mauritanian human rights campaigners remain hopeful and believe that the trial will ultimately lead to positive long-term changes.&lt;ref name="unpo.org"/&gt;

Niger continues to have significant problems with three forms of contemporary slavery: hereditary slavery, what Anti-Slavery International terms "passive slavery", and servile marriages called ''wahaya''.&lt;ref name=Abdelkader&gt;{{cite web|last=Abdelkader|first=Galy kadir|title=Slavery in Niger:Historical, Legal, and Contemporary Perspectives|year=2004|url=http://www.antislavery.org/includes/documents/cm_docs/2009/f/full_english_slavery_in_niger.pdf|publisher=Anti-Slavery International|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the continued problem of slavery and pressure from the [[Timidria]] organization, Niger became the first country in Western Africa to pass a law specifically criminalizing slavery.  Despite the law, slavery persists throughout the different ethnic groups of the country, women are particularly vulnerable, and a 2002 census confirmed the existence of 43,000 slaves and estimated that the total population could be over 870,000 people.&lt;ref name=Abdelkader /&gt; In a landmark case in 2008, the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) Community Court of Justice found the government of Niger responsible for continuing a woman's slave status as part of a wahaya marriage and awarded her {{US$|21,500}}.&lt;ref name=Duffy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duffy|first=Helen|title=HadijatouMani Koroua v Niger: Slavery Unveiled by the ECOWAS Court|journal=Human Rights Law Review|year=2008|pages=1–20|url=http://www.interights.org/files/28/HelenDuffyHRLR.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150604021132/http://www.interights.org/files/28/HelenDuffyHRLR.pdf|archivedate=4 June 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sudan===
{{main|Slavery in Sudan}}
Sudan has seen a resurgence of slavery since 1983, associated with the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Middle East Quarterly]]''. December 1999, Vol.6: Number 4. John Eibner, "My career redeeming slaves"&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of abductions range from 14,000 to 200,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery, Abduction and Forced Servitude in Sudan|url=https://www.state.gov/p/af/rls/rpt/2002/10445.htm|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=20 March 2014|date=22 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Sudan, [[Persecution of Christians|Christian]] and [[Animism|animist]] captives in the [[civil war]] are often enslaved, and female prisoners are often used sexually, with their [[Muslim]] captors claiming that [[Sharia|Islamic law]] grants them permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brandeis.edu/projects/fse/muslim/slavery.html Islam and Slavery], Brandeis University&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[CBS News|CBS news]], slaves have been sold for $50 per person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/01/25/world/main29927.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Curse Of Slavery Haunts Sudan | date=25 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[CNN]] reported that the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] was under pressure from Congress, including conservative Christians concerned about religious oppression and slavery, to address issues involved in the Sudanese conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/04/us.sudan/index.html | work=CNN | title=Danforth to be named U.S. envoy to Sudan | date=4 September 2001 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN has also quoted the [[U.S. State Department]]'s allegations: "The [Sudanese] government's support of slavery and its continued military action which has resulted in numerous deaths are due in part to the victims' [[Religion|religious beliefs]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Labott|first1=Elise|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/09/05/state.dept.religion/index.html|accessdate=14 October 2015|work=[[CNN]]|date=6 September 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923220548/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/09/05/state.dept.religion/index.html|archivedate=23 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jok Madut Jok, professor of History at [[Loyola Marymount University]], states that the abduction of women and children of the south by north is slavery by any definition. The government of Sudan insists that the whole matter is no more than the traditional tribal feuding over resources.&lt;ref&gt;Jok Madut Jok (2001), p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{main|Human trafficking in South Africa}}
Despite significant efforts made by the South African Government to combat trafficking in persons, the country has been placed on the “Tier 2 Watch List” by the US Department of Trafficking in Persons for the past four years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101205080913/http://www.sacbc.org.za/Site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=286&amp;Itemid=111 SABC South Africa people trafficking]&lt;/ref&gt;
South Africa shares borders with Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique and Swaziland. It has 72  official ports of entry "and a number of unofficial ports of entry where people come in and out without being detected" along its 5 000&amp;nbsp;km-long land borderline. The problem of porous borders is compounded by the lack of adequately trained employees, resulting in few police officials controlling large portions of the country's coastline.

A '''slipcase''' is a four or five-sided box, usually made of high-quality cardboard, into which [[ring binder|binder]]s, [[book]]s or book sets are ''slipped'' for protection, leaving the [[spine (book)|spine]] exposed.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite web
  |title=Book Terminology

  |publisher=Independent Online Booksellers Association
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special editions of books are often slipcased. A few publishers, such as the [[Folio Society]], publish all their books in slipcases.

Protective slipcases may be issued for cassettes, [[compact discs]] or [[DVD]]s instead of or in addition to the more common [[Optical_disc_packaging#Jewel_case|jewel cases]] or DVD [[keep case]], and may be chosen for aesthetic or economic reasons. Larger slipcases that are designed to house one or more jewel cases or DVD keep cases are often used in packaging for [[special edition]] releases of CDs or DVDs.

[[File:Inglehart Values Map.svg|thumb|350px|A [[World Values Survey]] cultural world map, describing the United States as low in "Rational-Secular Values" and high in "Self-Expression values".]]

The '''society of the United States''' is based on [[Western culture]], and has been developing since long before the [[United States]] became a country with its own unique social and cultural characteristics such as [[American English|dialect]], [[music of the United States|music]], [[Visual art of the United States|arts]], social habits, [[cuisine of the United States|cuisine]], [[folklore of the United States|folklore]], etc. Today the United States of America is an ethnically and racially [[Multiculturalism|diverse]] country as a result of large-scale immigration from many different countries throughout its history.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = |author2=Joseph Hickey  | year = 2005 | title = ''Society in Focus'' | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA | isbn = 0-205-41365-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its chief early influences came from English and Irish settlers of colonial America.  [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]], due to [[colonial history of the United States|colonial ties]] with Britain that spread the [[English language]], [[English law|legal system]] and other cultural inheritances, had a formative influence. Other important influences came from other parts of [[Europe]].

The United States has often been thought of as a melting pot, but recent developments tend towards cultural [[Multiculturalism|diversity]], pluralism and the image of a [[salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]] rather than a melting pot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/factover/ch1.htm |title=''One from Many, Portrait of the USA'' |publisher=United States Information Agency |last=Clack, George |date=September 1997 |chapter=Chapter 1 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122040945/http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/factover/ch1.htm |archivedate=2006-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dealing with Diversity1"&gt;{{cite book | last =Adams  | first =J.Q.  | authorlink =  |author2=Pearlie Strother-Adams   | year =2001  | title =''Dealing with Diversity''  | publisher =Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company  | location =Chicago, Illinois | isbn = 0-7872-8145-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the extent of American culture there are many integrated but unique social [[subculture]]s within the United States. The cultural affiliations an individual in the United States may have commonly depend on [[Social structure of the United States|social class]], [[Politics in the United States|political orientation]] and a multitude of demographic characteristics such as religious background, occupation and ethnic group membership.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = |author2=Joseph Hickey  | year = 2005 | title = ''Society in Focus''

==Social class and work==
{{Main|Social class in the United States}}
Though most Americans today identify themselves as [[American middle class|middle class]], American society and its culture are considerably more fragmented.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/now/politics/middleclassoverview.html|title=Middle class according to The Drum Major Institute for public policy|accessdate=2006-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Class, A Guide through the American status system"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fussel | first = Paul | year = 1983 | title = ''Class: A Guide through the American Status System'' | publisher = Touchstone | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-671-79225-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social class, generally described as a combination of [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]], [[Income in the United States|income]] and occupational prestige, is one of the greatest cultural influences in America.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt; Nearly all cultural aspects of mundane interactions and consumer behavior in the US are guided by a person's location within the country's [[Social structure of the United States|social structure]].

Distinct lifestyles, consumption patterns and values are associated with different classes. Early sociologist-economist [[Thorstein Veblen]], for example, noted that those at the very top of the social ladder engage in [[conspicuous leisure]] as well as [[conspicuous consumption]]. [[American middle class#The professional/managerial middle class|Upper-middle-class]] persons commonly identify [[Educational attainment in the United States|education]] and being cultured as prime values. Persons in this particular [[Social structure of the United States|social class]] tend to speak in a more direct manner that projects authority, knowledge and thus credibility. They often tend to engage in the consumption of so-called mass luxuries, such as [[designer label]] clothing. A strong preference for natural materials and organic foods as well as a strong health consciousness tend to be prominent features of the [[American middle class#The professional/managerial middle class|upper middle class]]. [[American middle class|Middle-class]] individuals in general value expanding one's horizon, partially because they are more educated and can afford greater leisure and travels. Working-class individuals take great pride in doing what they consider to be "real work," and keep very close-knit kin networks that serve as a safeguard against frequent economic instability.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Class, A Guide through the American status system1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fussel | first = Paul | year = 1983 | title = Class, A Guide through the American status system | publisher = Touchstone | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-671-79225-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | year = 1989 | title = ''Fear of Falling: The Inner Life of the Middle Class'' | publisher = HarperCollins | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-06-097333-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Work UN.png|thumb|350px|Hours worked in different countries according to UN data in a CNN report.&lt;ref name="CNN, work in American, UN report finds Americans most productive, 2002"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/CAREER/trends/08/30/ilo.study/|title=CNN, work in American, UN report finds Americans most productive, 2002|accessdate=2006-12-15 | date=2001-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Working-class Americans as well as many of those in the middle class may also face occupation alienation. In contrast to upper-middle-class professionals who are mostly hired to conceptualize, supervise and share their thoughts, many Americans enjoy only little autonomy or creative latitude in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eichar | first = Douglas | year = 1989 | title = ''Occupation and Class Consciousness in America'' | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | isbn = 0-313-26111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, white collar professionals tend to be significantly more satisfied with their work.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus2"&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink = |author2=Joseph Hickey  | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA | isbn = 0-205-41365-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Occupation and Class Consciousness in America1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eichar | first = Douglas | year = 1989 | title = Occupation and Class Consciousness in America | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | isbn = 0-313-26111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently those in the center of the income strata, who may still identify as middle class, have faced increasing economic insecurity,&lt;ref name="Harvard Magazine, Middle class squeeze"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/010682.html|title=Harvard Magazine, Middle class squeeze|accessdate=2006-12-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128052035/http://www.harvardmagazine.com/on-line/010682.html|archivedate=2006-11-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the idea of a working-class majority.&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ehrenreich | first = Barbara | year = 1989 | title = Fear of Falling, The Inner Life of the Middle Class | publisher = Harper Collins | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-06-097333-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political behavior is affected by class; more affluent individuals are more likely to vote, and education and income affect whether individuals tend to vote for the Democratic or Republican party. [[Income in the United States|Income]] also had a significant impact on health as those with higher [[Income in the United States|incomes]] had better access to health care facilities, higher [[life expectancy]], lower [[infant mortality rate]] and increased health consciousness.

In the [[United States]] occupation is one of the prime factors of [[Social structure of the United States|social class]] and is closely linked to an individual's identity. The average work week in the US for those employed full-time was 42.9 hours long with 30% of the population working more than 40 hours a week.&lt;ref name="US Bureau of Labor, hours worked, 2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/lf/aat19.txt|title=US Bureau of Labor, hours worked, 2005|accessdate=2006-12-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that many of those in the top two earning quintiles often worked more than 50 hours a week{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. The Average American worker earned $16.64 an hour in the first two quarters of 2006.&lt;ref name="US Department of Labor, employment in 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm|title=US Department of Labor, employment in 2006|accessdate=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall Americans worked more than their counterparts in other developed post-industrial nations. While the average worker in [[Denmark]] enjoyed 30 days of vacation annually, the average American only had 16 annual vacation days.&lt;ref name="International vacation comparison"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesizing.com/1vacatns.htm|title=International vacation comparison|accessdate=2006-12-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209194603/http://www.timesizing.com/1vacatns.htm|archivedate=2006-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 the average American worked 1,978 hours per year, 500 hours more than the average [[Germany|German]], yet 100 hours less than the average [[Czech Republic|Czech]]. Overall the US labor force was the most productive in the world (overall, not by hour worked), largely due to its workers working more than those in any other post-industrial country (excluding [[South Korea]]).&lt;ref name="CNN, work in American, UN report finds Americans most productive, 2002"/&gt; Americans generally hold working and being productive in high regard; being busy and working extensively may also serve as the means to obtain esteem.&lt;ref name="The Inner Life of the Middle Class1"/&gt;

==Race and ancestry==
{{Main|Race and ethnicity in the United States}}

[[File:Race in America.svg|thumb|350px|Ethnicity according to the 2000 US Census.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau, Race and Hispanic or Latino during the 2000 Census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable? bm=y&amp;-geo id=01000US&amp;-qr name=DEC 2000 SF1 U QTP3&amp;-ds name=DEC 2000 SF1 U|title=US Census Bureau, Race and Hispanic or Latino during the 2000 Census|accessdate=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:US Race Household Income.png|thumb|350px|Median Household income along ethnic lines in the United States.]]
The society in United States
Race in the United States is based on physical characteristics and skin color and has played an essential part in shaping American society even before the nation's conception.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus2"/&gt; Until the civil rights movement of the 1960s, racial minorities in the United States faced discrimination and social as well as economic [[marginalization]].&lt;ref name="The African American Odyssey"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hine|first=Darlene|authorlink=|author2=William C. Hine |author3=Stanley Harrold |year=2006|title=The African American Odyssey|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0-13-192217-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of the Census recognizes four races, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American or American Indian]], [[African American]], [[Asian American|Asian]] and [[White American|White]] ([[European American]]). According to the U.S. government, Hispanic Americans do not constitute a race, but rather an ethnic group. During the 2000 U.S. Census Whites made up 75.1% of the population with those being Hispanic or Latino constituting the nation's prevalent minority with 12.5% of the population. African Americans made up 12.3% of the total population, 3.6% were Asian American and 0.7% were Native American.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau, Race and Hispanic or Latino during the 2000 Census1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_QTP3&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U|title=US Census Bureau, Race and Hispanic or Latino during the 2000 Census|accessdate=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2015|6|14}}

Approximately 62% of White Americans today are either wholly or partly of English, Welsh, Irish, or Scottish ancestry.  Approximately 86% of White Americans are of northwestern European descent, and 14% are of southern and eastern European ancestry.

Until the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified on December 6, 1865 the United States was a slave society. While the northern states had outlawed slavery in their territory in the late 18th and early 19th century their industrial economies relied on the raw materials produced by slave labor. Following the Reconstruction period in the 1870s, Southern states initialized an apartheid regulated by [[Jim Crow laws]] that provided for legal segregation. Lynching occurred throughout the US until the 1930s, continuing well into the civil rights movement in the South.&lt;ref name="The African American Odyssey"/&gt;

Asian Americans were also marginalized during much of US history. Between 1882 and 1943 the United States government instituted the [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] which prohibited Chinese immigrants from entering the nation. During the second world war roughly 120,000 [[Japanese Americans]], 62% of whom were U.S. citizens,&lt;ref&gt;Semiannual Report of the War Relocation Authority, for the period January 1 to June 30, 1946, not dated. Papers of [[Dillon S. Myer]]. [http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/japanese_internment/documents/index.php?pagenumber=4&amp;documentid=62&amp;documentdate=1946-00-00&amp;collectionid=JI&amp;nav=ok Scanned image at] trumanlibrary.org.  Accessed 18 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; were imprisoned in [[Japanese American internment|Japanese internment camps]]. Hispanic Americans also faced segregation and other types of discrimination; they were regularly subject to second class citizen status, in practice if not by law.

Largely as a result of being de jure or de facto excluded and marginalized from so-called mainstream society, racial minorities in the United States developed their own unique sub-cultures. During the 1920s for example, [[Harlem, New York]] became home to the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. Music styles such as [[Jazz]], [[Blues]] and [[hip hop music|Rap]], [[Rock and roll]] as well as numerous folk-songs such as [[Blue Tail Fly|Blue Tail Fly (Jimmy Crack Corn)]] originated within the realms of African American culture.&lt;ref name="The African American Odyssey"/&gt; Chinatowns can be found in many cities across the nation and Asian cuisine has become a common staple in America.

The Mexican community has also had a dramatic impact on American culture. Today, Catholics are the largest religious denomination in the United States and out-number Protestants in the South-west and [[California]].&lt;ref name="Religion in the US by state"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/graphics/news/gra/gnoreligion/flash.htm|title=Religion in the US by state|accessdate=2006-12-14 | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mariachi music and Mexican cuisine are commonly found throughout the Southwest, with some Latin dishes of Mexican origin, such burritos and tacos found anywhere in the nation. Economic discrepancies and de facto segregation, however, continue and is a prominent feature of mundane life in the United States.

While [[Asian Americans]] have prospered and have a [[Household income in the United States|median household income]] and [[Educational attainment in the United States|educational attainment]] exceeding that of Whites, the same cannot be said for the other races. African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans have considerably lower [[Income in the United States|income]] and [[Educational attainment in the United States|education]] than do [[White American]]s.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau, Income newsbrief 2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/income_wealth/005647.html|title=US Census Bureau, Income newsbrief 2004|accessdate=2006-12-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061211105333/http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/income_wealth/005647.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau, educational attainment in the US, 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/p20-550.pdf|title=US Census Bureau, educational attainment in the U.S. 2003|accessdate=2006-12-15|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the [[Household income in the United States|median household income]] of Whites was 62.5% higher than that of African American, nearly one-quarter of whom live below the [[Poverty in the United States|poverty line]].&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau, Income newsbrief 2004"/&gt; Furthermore, 46.9% of [[Crime in the United States|homicide victims]] in the United States are African American indicating the many severe socio-economic problems African Americans and minorities in general continue to face in the twenty-first century.&lt;ref name="The African American Odyssey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US Department of Justice, Crime and Race"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/race.htm|title=US Department of Justice, Crime and Race|accessdate=2006-12-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061212100248/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/race.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some aspects of American culture codify racism. For example, the prevailing idea in [[American culture]], perpetuated by the media, has been that black features are less attractive or desirable than white features. The idea that blackness was ugly was highly damaging to the psyche of African Americans, manifesting itself as [[internalized racism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genderforum.uni-koeln.de/genderealisations/weedon.html Key Issues in Postcolonial Feminism: A Western Perspective] by Chris Weedon, Cardiff University &lt;blockquote&gt;In her novel ''The Bluest Eye'' (1981), [[Toni Morrison]] depicts the effects of the legacy of 19th century racism for poor black people in the United States. The novel tells of how the daughter of a poor black family, Pecola Breedlove, internalizes white standards of beauty to the point where she goes mad. Her fervent wish for blue eyes comes to stand for her wish to escape the poor, unloving, racist environment in which she lives.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Black is beautiful]] cultural movement sought to dispel this notion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bucks.edu/~docarmos/BCMnotes.html Some notes on the BLACK CULTURAL MOVEMENT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220045250/http://www.bucks.edu/~docarmos/BCMnotes.html |date=2007-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years after the [[September 11th terrorist attacks]], discrimination against Arabs and Muslims in the U.S. has increased significantly. The [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] (ADC) reported an increase in hate speech, cases of airline discrimination, hate crimes, police misconduct and racial profiling.&lt;ref name="adc.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adc.org/PDF/hcr02.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713160038/http://www.adc.org/PDF/hcr02.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[USA Patriot Act]], signed into effect by President Bush on October 26, 2001, has also raised concerns for violating civil liberties. Section 412 of the act provides the government with "sweeping new powers to detain immigrants and other foreign nationals indefinitely with little or no due process at the discretion of the Attorney General."&lt;ref name="adc.org"/&gt; Other sections also allow the government to conduct secret searches, seizures and surveillance, and to freely interpret the definition of 'terrorist activities'.

==Group affiliations==
[[File:Knights of Columbus in St. Patrick's Day Parade in Fort Collins, Colorado.jpg|thumb|250px|The Knights of Columbus exhibiting their group identity.]]
As the United States is a diverse nation, it is home to numerous organization and social groups and individuals may derive their group affiliated identity from a variety of sources. Many Americans, especially white collar professionals belong to professional organizations such as the APA, ASA or ATFLC {{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}, although books like ''[[Bowling Alone]]'' indicate that Americans affiliate with these sorts of groups less often than they did in the 1950s and 1960s.

Today, Americans derive a great deal of their identity through their work and professional affiliation, especially among individuals higher on the economic ladder. Recently professional identification has led to many clerical and low-level employees giving their occupations new, more respectable titles, such as "Sanitation service engineer" instead of "Janitor."&lt;ref name="Society in Focus2"/&gt;

Additionally many Americans belong to non-profit organizations and religious establishments and may volunteer their services to such organizations. The [[Rotary Club]], the [[Knights of Columbus]] or even the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] are examples of such non-profit and mostly volunteer run organizations. Ethnicity plays another important role in providing some Americans with group identity,&lt;ref name="The African American Odyssey"/&gt;
especially among those who recently immigrated.&lt;ref name="Dealing with Diversity2"&gt;{{cite book | last =Adams  | first =J.Q.  | authorlink =  |author2=Pearlie Strother-Adams   | year =2001  | title =Dealing with Diversity  | publisher =Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company  | location =Chicago, Illinois | isbn = 0-7872-8145-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many American cities are home to [[ethnic enclave]]s such as a [[Chinatown]] and [[Little Italy|Little Italies]] which still remain in some cities. Local patriotism may be also provide group identity. For example, a person may be particularly proud to be from California or New York City, and may display clothing from a local [[sports in the United States|sports team]].

Political lobbies such as the [[AARP]], [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]], [[NAACP]], [[National Organization for Women|NOW]] and [[GLAAD]] (examples being [[civil rights]] activist organizations) not only provide individuals with a sentiment of intra-group allegiance but also increase their political representation in the nation's political system. Combined, profession, ethnicity, religious, and other group affiliations have provided Americans with a multitude of options to derive group based identity from.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus2"/&gt;

==Technology, gadgets, and automobiles==
{{Further|Technological and industrial history of the United States|Passenger vehicles in the United States}}
Americans, by and large, are often fascinated by new technology and new gadgets. There are many within the United States that share the attitude that through technology, many of the evils in the society can be solved. Many of the new technological innovations in the modern world were either first invented in the United States and/or first widely adopted by Americans. Examples include: the [[lightbulb]], the [[airplane]], the [[transistor]], [[nuclear power]], the [[personal computer]], [[video games]] and [[ecommerce|online shopping]], as well as the development of the [[Internet]]. By comparison with [[Culture of Japan|Japan]], however, only a small fraction of electronic devices make it to sale in the US, and household items such as toilets are rarely festooned with remotes and electronic buttons as they are in some parts of Asia.

Automobiles play a great role in American culture, whether it is in the mundane lives of private individuals or in the areas of arts and entertainment. The rise of suburbs and the desire for workers to commute to cities brought about the popularization of automobiles. In 2001, 90% of Americans drove to work in cars.&lt;ref name=2001summary&gt;[http://www.bts.gov/publications/highlights_of_the_2001_national_household_travel_survey/html/executive_summary.html Highlights of the 2001 National Household Travel Survey], Bureau of Transportation Statistics, U.S. Department of Transportation, accessed May 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Lower energy and land costs favor the production of relatively large, powerful cars. The culture in the 1950s and 1960s often catered to the automobile with [[motel]]s and [[drive-in restaurant]]s. Americans tend to view obtaining a driver's license as a rite of passage. Outside of a relative few urban areas, it is considered a necessity for most Americans to own and drive cars. [[New York City]] is the only locality in the United States where more than half of all households do not own a car.&lt;ref name=2001summary /&gt;

==Drugs, alcohol and smoking==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2007}}
American attitudes towards [[drug]]s and [[alcoholic beverage]]s have evolved considerably throughout the country's history.  During the nineteenth century, alcohol was readily available and consumed, and no laws restricted the use of other drugs. A movement to ban alcoholic beverages, called the [[Prohibition]] movement, emerged in the late-nineteenth century. Several American [[Protestant]] religious groups, as well as women's groups such as the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]], supported the movement.

In 1919, Prohibitionists succeeded in [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|amending the Constitution]] to prohibit the sale of alcohol.  Although the Prohibition period did result in lowering alcohol consumption overall, banning alcohol outright proved to be unworkable, as the previously legitimate distillery industry was replaced by criminal gangs which trafficked in alcohol. Prohibition [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|was repealed]] in 1931. States and localities retained the right to remain "dry", and to this day, [[dry county|a handful]] still do.

During the [[Vietnam War]] era, attitudes swung well away from prohibition.  Commentators noted that an eighteen-year-old could be [[Conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the military to fight in a war overseas, but could not buy a beer. Most states lowered the legal drinking age to eighteen.

Since 1980, the trend has been toward greater restrictions on alcohol and drug use. The focus this time, however, has been to criminalize behaviors associated with alcohol, rather than attempt to prohibit consumption outright. [[New York (state)|New York]] was the first state to enact tough [[drink-driving]] laws in 1980; since then all other states have followed suit.  A "[[Just Say No]] to Drugs" movement replaced the more libertine ethos of the 1960s.

==Sports==
[[File:Basketball game.jpg|thumb|upright|A 2004 [[United States Military Academy|Army]]-[[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] basketball game]]
{{Main|Sports in the United States}}

Since the late nineteenth century, [[baseball]] is regarded as the [[national sport]]; [[American football|football]], [[basketball]], and [[ice hockey]] are the country's three other leading professional team sports. [[College football]] and [[College basketball|basketball]] also attract large audiences. Football is now by several measures the most popular [[spectator sport]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Krane, David K.|title=Professional Football Widens Its Lead Over Baseball as Nation's Favorite Sport|url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=337| publisher =Harris Interactive| date = 2002-10-30| accessdate=2007-09-14}} Maccambridge, Michael (2004). ''America's Game: The Epic Story of How Pro Football Captured a Nation''. New York: Random House. {{ISBN|0-375-50454-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Association football|Soccer]], though not a leading professional sport in the country, is played widely at the youth and amateur levels.

[[Boxing]] and [[horse racing]] were once the most watched individual sports, but they have been eclipsed by [[golf]] and [[auto racing]], particularly [[NASCAR]]. [[Tennis]] and many outdoor sports are also popular.

== Food ==
{{Main|Fashion in the United States|Cuisine of the United States}}
[[File:Cheeseburger.png|thumb|250px|A [[hamburger]] is a famous food in the United States.]]

The cuisine of the United States is extremely diverse, owing to the vastness of the continent, the relatively large population (1/3 of a billion people) and the number of native and immigrant influences.  The types of [[food]] served at home vary greatly and depend upon the region of the country and the family's own cultural heritage. Recent immigrants tend to eat food similar to that of their country of origin, and [[Americanization|Americanized]] versions of these cultural foods, such as [[American Chinese cuisine]] or [[Italian-American cuisine]] often eventually appear; an example is [[Vietnamese cuisine]], [[Korean cuisine]] and [[Thai cuisine]].

[[German cuisine]] has a profound impact on American cuisine, especially mid-western cuisine, with potatoes, noodles, roasts, stews and cakes/pastries being the most iconic ingredients in both cuisines.&lt;ref name="Dealing with Diversity2"/&gt; Dishes such as the hamburger, pot roast, baked ham and hot dogs are examples of American dishes derived from German cuisine.&lt;ref name="History of the hot dog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hot-dog.org/hd/hd_history.htm|title=History of the hot dog|accessdate=2006-11-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061018070129/http://www.hot-dog.org/hd/hd_history.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History of the Hamburger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahamburgertoday.com/archives/2005/08/the_history_of.php|title=History of the Hamburger|accessdate=2006-11-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061121121752/http://www.ahamburgertoday.com/archives/2005/08/the_history_of.php|archivedate=2006-11-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different regions of the United States have their own cuisine and styles of cooking. The state of Louisiana, for example, is known for its Cajun and Creole cooking. Cajun and Creole cooking are influenced by French, Acadian, and Haitian cooking, although the dishes themselves are original and unique. Examples include Crawfish Etouffee, Red Beans and Rice, Seafood or Chicken Gumbo, Jambalaya, and Boudin.  Italian, German, Hungarian and Chinese influences, traditional Native American, Caribbean, Mexican and Greek dishes have also diffused into the general American repertoire.  It is not uncommon for a 'middle-class' family from 'middle-America' to eat, for example, restaurant pizza, home-made pizza, enchiladas con carne, chicken paprikas, beef stroganof and bratwurst with sauerkraut for dinner throughout a single week.

== Clothing ==
Apart from professional business attire, clothing in the United States is eclectic and predominantly informal. While Americans' diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing, particularly those of recent immigrants, [[cowboy hat]]s and [[cowboy boot|boots]] and leather [[motorcycle jackets]] are emblematic of specifically American styles.

[[Jeans|Blue jeans]] were popularized as work clothes in the 1850s by merchant [[Levi Strauss]], a Jewish-German immigrant in San Francisco, and adopted by many American teenagers a century later. They are now widely worn on every continent by people of all ages and social classes. Along with mass-marketed informal wear in general, blue jeans are arguably U.S. culture's primary contribution to global fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Fred (1992). ''Fashion, Culture, and Identity''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 69. {{ISBN|0-226-13809-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The country is also home to the headquarters of many leading [[designer label]]s such as [[Ralph Lauren]] and [[Calvin Klein]]. Labels such as [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] and [[Eckō Unltd.]] cater to various [[niche market]]s.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in the United States|Educational attainment in the United States}}

Education in the United States is provided mainly by government, with control and funding coming from three levels: [[Federal government of the United States|federal]], [[State government|state]], and [[Local government|local]].  School attendance is mandatory and nearly universal at the [[Elementary school|elementary]] and [[high school]] levels (often known outside the United States as the [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary]] levels).

Students have the options of having their education held in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s, [[private school]]s, or [[homeschooling|home school]].  In most public and private schools, education is divided into three levels: [[Primary education in the United States|elementary school]], [[Middle school|junior high school]] (also often called middle school), and [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]].  In almost all schools at these levels, children are divided by age groups into [[Grade levels|grades]].  [[Post-secondary education]], better known as "college" or "university" in the United States, is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system.

In the year 2000, there were 76.6 million students enrolled in schools from [[kindergarten]] through [[graduate school]]s.  Of these, 72 percent aged 12 to 17 were judged academically "on track" for their age (enrolled in school at or above grade level).  Of those enrolled in compulsory education, 5.2 million (10.4 percent) were attending private schools.  Among the country's adult population, over 85 percent have completed high school and 27 percent have received a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher.

==Language==
{{Main|Languages in the United States}}
The primary, although not official, [[languages in the United States|language of the United States]] is [[English language|English]].  According to the [[2000 U.S. Census]], more than 93% of Americans can speak English well, and for 81% it is the only language spoken at home. Nearly 30 million native speakers of Spanish also reside in the US. There are more than 300 languages besides English which can claim native speakers in the United States—some of which are spoken by the indigenous peoples (about 150 living languages) and others which were imported by immigrants.

[[American Sign Language]], used mainly by the deaf, is also native to the country. [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] is also a language native to the United States, as it is indigenous nowhere else except in the state of Hawaii. Spanish is the second most common language in the United States, and is one of the official languages, and the most widely spoken, in the [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|U.S. Commonwealth]] of [[Puerto Rico]].

There are four major regional [[List of dialects of the English language|dialects]] in the United States: northeastern, south, inland north, and midwestern. The [[General American|Midwestern accent]] (considered the "standard accent" in the United States, and analogous in some respects to the [[received pronunciation]] elsewhere in the English-speaking world) extends from what were once the "[[Middle Colonies]]" across the Midwest to the Pacific states.

==Religion==
[[File:Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.jpg|thumb|Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, the Roman Catholic seat of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles]]
{{Main|Religion in the United States}}

Historically, the United States' religious tradition has been dominated by [[Protestant]] [[Christianity]]. Today over three quarters of Americans identify as Christian with a slight majority identifying as Protestant (56%). Catholicism (27%) is the largest Christian denomination, as Protestants belong to a variety of denominations. Also practiced in the United States are many other religions, such as [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], Mormonism and [[neo-pagan]] religions, (most prominently [[Wicca]]) among others.  Approximately 16% of American citizens identify as [[atheist]], [[agnostic]], or having no religion.

The government is a secular institution, with what is often called  the "[[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]]" prevailing.

==Housing==
Immediately after [[World War II]], Americans began living in increasing
numbers in the [[suburb]]s, belts around major cities with higher density than [[rural sociology|rural]] areas, but much lower than [[urban area]]s. This move has been attributed to many factors such as the automobile, the availability of large tracts of land, the convenience of more and longer paved roads, the increasing violence in urban centers (see [[white flight]]), and cheaper housing. These new single-family houses were usually one or two stories tall, and often were part of large contracts of homes built by a single developer.

The resulting low-density development has been given the pejorative label [[urban sprawl]]. This is changing, however. [[White flight]] is reversing, with many [[Yuppies]] and upper-middle-class, [[empty nest syndrome|empty nest]] [[Baby Boomers]] returning to urban living, usually in [[condominium|condominia]], such as in New York City's Lower East Side, and [[Chicago Loop|Chicago's South Loop]]. The result has been the displacement of many poorer, inner-city residents. (see [[gentrification]]).

American cities with housing prices near the national median have also been losing the [[Household income in the United States|middle income]] neighborhoods, those with median income between 80% and 120% of the metropolitan area's median household income. Here, the more affluent members of the middle-class, who are also often referred to as being professional or upper middle-class, have left in search of larger homes in more exclusive suburbs. This trend is largely attributed to the so-called "[[American middle class#Middle class squeeze|Middle class squeeze]]", which has caused a starker distinction between the [[American middle class#statistical middle class|statistical middle class]] and the more privileged members of the [[American middle class|middle class]].&lt;ref name="Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101735.html|title=Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods|accessdate=2006-07-25 | work=The Washington Post | first=Blaine | last=Harden | date=2006-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more expensive areas such as [[California]], however, another trend has been taking place where an influx of more affluent middle-class households has displaced those in the actual middle of society and converted former [[American middle class#statistical middle class|middle-middle-class]] neighborhoods into [[Upper middle class#American upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/21/AR2006062101735.html|title=Washington Post, America is losing its middle income neighborhoods.|accessdate=2006-07-25 | work=The Washington Post | first=Blaine | last=Harden | date=2006-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of rural areas has been declining over time as more and more people migrate to cities for work and entertainment. The great exodus from the farms came in the 1940s; in recent years fewer than 2% of the population lives on farms (though many others live in the countryside and commute to work). Electricity and telephone, and sometimes cable and Internet services are available to all but the most remote regions. As in the cities, children attend school up to and including high school and only help with [[farming]] during the summer months or after school.

[[File:Cincinnati-suburbs-tract-housing.jpg|thumb|Tract housing in [[Kentucky]] near [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]]]
About half of Americans now live in what is known as the [[suburb]]s. The suburban nuclear family has been identified as part of the "[[American dream]]": a married couple with children owning a house in the suburbs. This archetype is reinforced by mass media, religious practices, and government policies and is based on traditions from Anglo-Saxon cultures. One of the biggest differences in suburban living as compared to urban living is the housing occupied by the families. The suburbs are filled with single-family homes separated from retail districts, industrial areas, and sometimes even public schools. However, many American suburbs are incorporating these districts on smaller scales, attracting more people to these communities.

Housing in urban areas may include more [[apartment]]s and semi-attached homes than in the suburbs or small towns. Aside from housing, the major difference from suburban living is the density and diversity of many different subcultures, as well as retail and manufacturing buildings mixed with housing in urban areas. Urban residents are also more likely to travel by mass transit, and children are more likely to walk or cycle rather than being driven by their parents.

==Gender relations==
===Courtship, cohabitation, and sexuality===
{{Main|Sexuality in the United States}}
Couples often meet through religious institutions, work, school, or friends. "Dating services," services that are geared to assist people in finding partners, are popular both on and offline. The trend over the past few decades has been for more and more couples deciding to cohabit before, or instead of, getting married. The [[United States Census Bureau|2000 Census]] reported 9,700,000 opposite-sex partners living together and about 1,300,000 same-sex partners living together. These cohabitation arrangements have not been the subject of many laws regulating them, though some states now have [[domestic partner]] statutes and judge-made [[palimony]] doctrines that confer some legal support for unmarried couples.

[[Adolescent sexuality in the United States|Adolescent sex]] is common; most Americans first have sexual intercourse in their teenage years. The current data suggests that by the time a person turns eighteen years old, slightly more than half of females and nearly two-thirds of males will have had sexual relations.&lt;ref name="Beginning"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aspe.hhs.gov/HSP/cyp/xsteesex.htm|title=Beginning Too Soon: Adolescent Sexual Behavior, Pregnancy And Parenthood|accessdate=2007-03-11|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of sexually active teens have had sexual partners they are dating.&lt;ref name="manning"&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Wendy D.

===Marriage and divorce===
{{Main|Marriage in the United States|Divorce in the United States}}
{{See also|Cohabitation in the United States}}
[[Marriage]] laws are established by individual states. [[Same-sex marriage]] has been legal in the United States since 26 June 2015.

In many states, it is illegal to cross state lines to obtain a marriage that would be illegal in the home state. The typical [[wedding]] involves a couple proclaiming their commitment to one another in front of their close relatives and friends, often presided over by a religious figure such as a minister, priest, or rabbi, depending upon the faith of the couple. In traditional Christian ceremonies, the bride's father will "give away" (hand off) the bride to the groom. Secular weddings are also common, often presided over by a judge, [[Justice of the Peace]], or other municipal official.

[[Divorce]] is the province of state governments, so divorce law varies from state to state. Prior to the 1970s, divorcing spouses had to prove that the other spouse was [[Divorce#At-fault divorce|at fault]], for instance for being guilty of [[adultery]], abandonment, or cruelty; when spouses simply could not get along, lawyers were forced to manufacture "uncontested" divorces. The [[no-fault divorce]] revolution began in 1969 in California and ended with New York. No-fault divorce (on the grounds of "irreconcilable differences", "irretrievable breakdown of marriage", "incompatibility", or after a separation period etc.) is now available in all states.

As with other Western countries, the United States has now a substantial proportion of children born outside of marriage: in 2010, 40.7% of all births were to unmarried women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/births.htm|title=FastStats|date=5 February 2018|website=www.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State law provides for [[child support]] where children are involved, and sometimes for [[alimony]]. "Married adults now divorce two-and-a-half times as often as adults did 20 years ago and four times as often as they did 50 years ago... between 40% and 60% of ''new'' marriages will eventually end in divorce. The probability within... the first five years is 20%, and the probability of its ending within the first 10 years is 33%... Perhaps 25% of children ages sixteen and under live with a step-parent."&lt;ref&gt;Brian K. Williams, Stacy C. Sawyer, Carl M. Wahlstrom, ''Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The median length for a marriage in the US today is eleven years with 90% of all divorces being settled out of court.

===Gender roles===
Since the 1970s, traditional [[gender role]]s of male and female have been increasingly challenged by both legal and social means. Today, there are far fewer roles that are legally restricted by one's sex.

Most social roles are not gender-restricted by law, though there are still cultural inhibitions surrounding certain roles. More and more women have entered the workplace, and in the year 2000, made up 46.6% of the labor force; up from 18.3% in 1900. Most men, however, have not taken up the traditional full-time [[homemaker]] role; likewise, few men have taken traditionally feminine jobs such as [[receptionist]] or [[nurse]] (although nursing was traditionally a male role prior to the [[American Civil War]]).

==Death rituals==
It is customary for Americans to hold a [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]] in a [[funeral home]] within a couple days of the death of a loved one.  The body of the deceased may be [[embalmed]] and dressed in fine clothing if there will be an open-casket [[Viewing (funeral)|viewing]].  Traditional Jewish and Muslim practice include a ritual bath and no embalming.  Friends, relatives and acquaintances gather, often from distant parts of the country, to "pay their last respects" to the deceased.  Flowers are brought to the [[coffin]] and sometimes [[eulogy|eulogies]], [[elegy|elegies]], personal anecdotes or group prayers are recited.  Otherwise, the attendees sit, stand or kneel in quiet contemplation or prayer.  Kissing the corpse on the forehead is typical among Italian Americans&lt;ref name="The Italian Way of Death"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/weekly/paglia960805.html|title=The Italian Way of Death|accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.  [[Condolences]] are also offered to the widow or widower and other close relatives.

A [[funeral]] may be held immediately afterwards or the next day.  The funeral ceremony varies according to religion and culture.  American Catholics typically hold a [[Catholic funeral|funeral mass]] in a church, which sometimes takes the form of a [[Requiem]] mass.  Jewish Americans may hold a service in a [[synagogue]] or temple.  [[Pallbearer]]s carry the coffin of the deceased to the [[hearse]], which then proceeds in a [[procession]] to the place of final repose, usually a [[cemetery]].  The unique [[Jazz funeral]] of New Orleans features joyous and raucous music and dancing during the procession.

[[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] (founded in 1831) is known as "America's first garden cemetery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Old Cambridge |last=Bunting |first=Bainbridge |author2=Robert H. Nylander  |year=1973 |publisher=Cambridge Historical Commission |location= Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-262-53014-7 |pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  American [[cemetery|cemeteries]] created since are distinctive for their [[rural cemetery|park-like setting]].   Rows of [[grave (burial)|grave]]s are covered by [[lawn]]s and are interspersed with trees and flowers.  [[Headstone]]s, [[mausoleum]]s, statuary or simple plaques typically mark off the individual graves.  [[Cremation]] is another common practice in the United States, though it is frowned upon by various religions.  The ashes of the deceased are usually placed in an [[urn]], which may be kept in a private house, or they are interred.  Sometimes the ashes are released into the atmosphere.  The "sprinkling" or "scattering" of the ashes may be part of an informal ceremony, often taking place at a scenic natural feature (a [[cliff]], [[lake]] or [[mountain]]) that was favored by the deceased.

A so-called [[death industry]] has developed in the United States that has replaced earlier, more informal traditions.  Before the popularity of funeral homes, a wake would be held in an ordinary, private house.  Often the most elegant room was reserved for this purpose.

==Household arrangements==
{{Further|American family structure}}
[[File:Families US.svg|thumb|250px|[[American family structure|US family structure]] has no particular household arrangement being prevalent enough to be identified as the average.&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink = |author2=Stacey C. Sawyer |author3=Carl M. Wahlstrom  | year = 2005 | title = Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, MA | isbn = 0-205-36674-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Today, family arrangements in the United States reflect the diverse and dynamic nature of contemporary American society.  Although for a relatively brief period of time in the 20th century most families adhered to the [[nuclear family]] concept (two-married adults with a biological child), single-parent families, [[childless]]/[[childfree]] couples, and fused families now constitute the majority of families.

Most Americans will marry and get divorced at least once during their life; thus, most individuals will live in a variety of family arrangements.  A person may grow up in a single-parent family, go on to marry and live in childless couple arrangement, then get divorced, live as a single for a couple of years, remarry, have children and live in a nuclear family arrangement.&lt;ref name="Society in Focus2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The nuclear family... is the idealized version of what most people think when they think of "family..." The old definition of what a family is... the nuclear family- no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today, according to many social scientists (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). Thus has arisen the term ''postmodern family'', which is meant to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and child-free couples."- Brian K. Williams, Stacey C. Sawyer, Carl M. Wahlstrom, ''Marriages, Families &amp; Intinamte Relationships'', 2005.&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other changes to the landscape of American family arrangements include dual-income earner households and delayed independence among American youths.  Whereas most families in the 1950s and 1960s relied on one income earner, more commonly the husband, the vast majority of family households now have two-income earners.

Another change is the increasing age at which young Americans leave their parental home. Traditionally, a person past "college age" who lived with their parent(s) was viewed negatively, but today it is not uncommon for children to live with their parents until their mid-twenties.  This trend can be mostly attributed to rising [[Real estate pricing|living costs]] that far exceed those in decades past.  Thus, many young adults now remain with their parents well past their mid-20s.  This topic was a cover article of TIME magazine in 2005.

Exceptions to the custom of leaving home in one's mid-20s can occur especially among Italian and Hispanic Americans, and in expensive urban real estate markets such as [[New York City]] [http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/NY-New-York-Pricing.html], [[California]] [http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/CA-San-Francisco-Pricing.html], and [[Honolulu]] [http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/HI-Honolulu-Pricing.html], where monthly rents commonly exceed $1000 a month.

Single-parent households are households consisting of a single adult (most often a woman) and one or more children. In the single-parent household, one parent typically raises the children with little to no help from the other. This parent is the sole "breadwinner" of the family and thus these households are particularly vulnerable economically. They have higher rates of [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]], and children of these households are more likely to have educational problems.

==Regional variations==
Cultural differences in the various [[regions of the United States]] are explored in [[New England]], [[Mid-Atlantic States]], [[Southern United States]], [[Midwestern United States]], [[Southwest United States]], [[Western United States]] and [[Pacific Northwest|Pacific Northwestern United States]] pages. The western coast of the continental United States consisting of [[California]], [[Oregon]], and the state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] is also sometimes referred to as the [[Left Coast]], indicating its left-leaning political orientation and tendency towards liberal norms, folkways and values.

Strong cultural differences have a long history in the US with the southern slave society in the antebellum period serving as a prime example. Not only social, but also economic tensions between the Northern and Southern states were so severe that they eventually caused the South to declare itself an independent nation, the [[Confederate States of America]]; thus provoking the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name="The African American Odyssey1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hine|first=Darlene|authorlink=|author2=William C. Hine |author3=Stanley Harrold |year=2006|title=''The African American Odyssey''|publisher=Pearson|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0-13-192217-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of regional variations is the attitude towards the discussion of sex, often sexual discussions would have less restrictions in the [[Northeastern United States]], but yet is seen as taboo in the [[Southern United States]].

In his 1989 book, ''[[Albion's Seed]]'' ({{ISBN|0195069056}}), [[David Hackett Fischer]] suggests that the United States is made up today of four distinct regional cultures. The book's focus is on the folkways of four groups of settlers from the [[British Isles]] that emigrated from distinct regions of Britain and Ireland to the British American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries.  Fischer's thesis is that the culture and folkways of each of these groups persisted, with some modification over time, providing the basis for the four modern regional cultures of the United States.

According to Fischer, the foundation of American culture was formed from four mass migrations from four different regions of the British Isles by four distinct socio-religious groups. New England's earliest settlement period occurred between 1629-1640 when [[Puritan]]s, mostly from [[East Anglia]] in England, settled there, forming the New England regional culture. The next mass migration was of southern English [[cavalier]]s and their Irish and Scottish domestic servants to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region between 1640-1675, producing the Southern American culture. Then, between 1675-1725, thousands of Irish, English and German [[Quaker]]s, led by [[William Penn]], settled in the [[Delaware Valley]].

This settlement resulted in the formation of what is today considered the "General American" culture, although, according to Fischer, it is really just a regional American culture, even if it does today encompass most of the U.S. from the mid-Atlantic states to the Pacific Coast.  Finally, Irish, Scottish and English settlers from the borderlands of Britain and Ireland migrated to [[Appalachia]] between 1717-1775.  They formed the regional culture of the [[Upland South]], which has since spread west to such areas as [[West Texas]] and parts of the [[U.S. Southwest]]. Fischer says that the modern U.S. is composed only of regional cultures, with characteristics determined by the place of departure and time of arrival of these four distinct founding populations.

==Criticisms==

=== Gun violence ===
{{Main|Gun violence in the United States}}
The US is considered to have some of the most permissive gun laws among developed countries. Americans make up 4 percent of the world's population but own 46 percent of the global stock of privately held firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/there-are-more-guns-than-people-in-the-united-states-according-to-a-new-study-of-global-firearm-ownership/|title=Analysis {{!}} There are more guns than people in the United States, according to a new study of global firearm ownership|last=https://www.facebook.com/chrisingraham|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is about 294 million guns with a population of 301 million (2007 figures), almost one gun for every American on average.&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32842.pdf, "Gun Control Legislation", Congressional Research Service, November 12, 2012,&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001–2, the United States had above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of [[Gun violence in the United States|gun violence]] compared to other developed nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unodc.org/pdf/crime/eighthsurvey/8sv.pdf, ''United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). March 31, 2005. Retrieved August 6, 2018.''&lt;/ref&gt; A cross-sectional analysis of the [[World Health Organization]] Mortality Database from 2010 showed that United States "homicide rates were 7.0 times higher than in other high-income countries, driven by a gun homicide rate that was 25.2 times higher."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grinshteyn|first=Erin|last2=Hemenway|first2=David|date=March 2016|title=Violent Death Rates: The US Compared with Other High-income OECD Countries, 2010|url=https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(15)01030-X/fulltext|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|language=English|volume=129|issue=3|pages=266–273|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2015.10.025|issn=0002-9343}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Gun ownership rights]] continue to be the subject of [[Gun politics in the United States|contentious political debate]].

=== Money in politics ===
{{Main|Campaign finance reform in the United States}}
In his dissent in ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]'', Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the context of election to public office, the distinction between corporate and human speakers is significant.  Although they make enormous contributions to our society, corporations are not actually members of it. They cannot vote or run for office. Because they may be managed and controlled by nonresidents, their interests may conflict in fundamental respects with the interests of eligible voters. The financial resources, legal structure, and instrumental orientation of corporations raise legitimate concerns about their role in the electoral process. Our lawmakers have a compelling constitutional basis, if not also a democratic duty, to take measures designed to guard against the potentially deleterious effects of corporate spending in local and national races.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Wealth gap ===
{{Main|Wealth inequality in the United States}}
In the 2013 documentary ''[[Inequality for All]]'', [[Robert Reich]] argued that income inequality is a defining issue for the United States. He stated that 95% of post-recession economic gains went to the top 1% net worth ([[HNWI]]) since 2009, when the recovery is agreed to have started.

==History==
[[File:The Filipino Channel Old.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The old logo of The Filipino Channel (2000s-2011).]]
On September 24, 1994, then ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation (now [[ABS-CBN | ABS-CBN Corporation]]) through its newly established subsidiary ABS-CBN International signed a historic deal with the [[PanAmSat]] to bring the first trans-Pacific Asian programming service to some two million Filipino immigrants in the United States using the then-newly launched PAS 2 satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Jessel|first=Harry|last2=Taishoff|first2=Lawrence|title=Television and Radio|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]]|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first headquarters of TFC was built in a garage in [[Daly City, California]] with only eight employees doing all the tasks from managing the phones, the computers, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Journey of Triumph of the Filipino Spirit|url=http://www.abs-cbni.com/about/images/PhilippineNews-TFC15thSuplement-pg1.pdf|publisher=''ABS-CBN International''|date=2009|accessdate=18 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117025043/http://www.abs-cbni.com/about/images/PhilippineNews-TFC15thSuplement-pg1.pdf|archivedate=17 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1995, TFC has grown to 25,000 subscribers in the United States. Airings of Mara Clara and other programming aired during the daytime and night in 1997 Esperanza and Mula Sa Puso where the biggest programs on TFC 

In 1996, TFC Direct! was launched, an independently operated direct-to-home television service that incorporates the TV channels Sarimanok News Network (now [[ABS-CBN News Channel]]), Pinoy Blockbuster Channel (now [[Cinema One]]), Pinoy Central (later renamed as Kapamilya Channel, then it was replaced by [[BRO (TV channel)|Bro]], and now it was replaced again by [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action|ABS-CBN Sports + Action (S+A)]]), and the radio channels [[DZMM-AM|DZMM Radyo Patrol 630]] and WRR 101.9 For Life! (now [[DWRR-FM|MOR 101.9]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Filipino Channel: Bringing overseas Pinoys closer to home|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=200144|publisher=''[[The Philippine Star]]''|date=24 March 2003|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 2004, TFC has grown to 250,000 subscribers in the United States. This growth led to the expansion of TFC to other territories in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katigbak|first=Antonio|title=ABS-CBN's The Filipino Channel marks a decade of steady growth|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=245708|publisher=''[[The Philippine Star]]''|date=11 April 2004|accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, ABS-CBN International signed an affiliation agreement with [[DirecTV]], one of the leading DTH providers in the United States. Under the deal, DirecTV has the exclusive right to distribute the TFC package on its DTH platform. In return, DirecTV will pay license fees to ABS-CBN and to ABS-CBN International.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Villanueva|first=Paul Michael|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/94954928/ABS-CBN-17-A-2011|title=ABS-CBN 17-A 2011|publisher=''Scribd.com''|date=31 December 2011|page=8|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the now defunct and award-winning internet television service TFC Now! was launched. This was later replaced by TFC.tv video streaming website. In this year, ABS-CBN International acquired San Francisco International Gateway from [[Loral Space &amp; Communications]].

==Programming==

'''Thomas "Shang" Draper''' (1839–1883) was a [[criminal]] [[shanghaiing|shanghaier]], saloon keeper, and criminal gang leader in [[New York City]] along the city waterfront.

==Early life==

==Criminal career==
Shang Draper ran a waterfront [[bar (establishment)|saloon]] in his native New York City, where he performed a [[Confidence trick|confidence scam]] using an underage girl to lure a [[Confidence trick|mark]] to a dark hotel room (which Draper owned) only to rob him.  Draper acquired his distinctive nickname "Shang" from the "shanghaiing" trick he used to play on his unsuspecting patrons.  Draper would drug a bar patron with [[laudanum]] and by the time the fellow awoke, he would have been [[Impressment|pressed]] into [[merchant marine]] or naval service, sometimes for a foreign land.

Draper was a contemporary of [[Frederika Mandelbaum]], a notorious gangleader in her own right, also based in his native New York City.  Mandlebaum installed Draper, one of her trusted lieutenants, in a [[bank robbery]] gang fronted by [[George Leonidas Leslie|George Leslie]].

==Death==
Thomas Draper died in 1883 in New York City.{{citation needed|reason=Some sources suggest that Draper died in 1907|date=July 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3596">The '''Turanid race''' was a sub-race of the greater [[Caucasian race]]. In [[racial anthropology]], the type was traditionally held to be most common among the populations native to [[Central Asia]]. The name is taken from the phylum of [[Ural-Altaic languages|Turanian languages]], which are the combination of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] families, hence also referred to as the term ''Ural–Altaic race''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theapricity.com/snpa/racesofeurope.htm The Races of Europe] by Carleton S. Coon&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter usage implies the existence of a Turanid [[race (classification of human beings)|racial type]] or "minor race", subtype of the Caucasoid race with Mongoloid admixtures, situated at the boundary of the distribution of the [[Mongoloid]] and Caucasoid "great races".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=01LfoBC6jZkC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=turanid+race&amp;lr=&amp;hl=bg#v=onepage&amp;q=turanid%20race&amp;f=false Racial and cultural minorities: an analysis of prejudice and discrimination, Environment, development, and public policy, George Eaton Simpson, John Milton Yinger,  Springer, 1985, {{ISBN|0-306-41777-4}}, p.32.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''American anthropologist'', American Anthropological Association, Anthropological Society of Washington (Washington, D.C,), 1984 v. 86, nos. 3-4, p. 741.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea of a Turanid race came to play a role of some significance in [[Pan-Turkism]] or "[[Turanism]]" in the late 19th to 20th century. A "Turkish race" was proposed as a Caucasoid subtype in European literature of the period. 

This literature was absorbed by the Ottoman elite, and was partly even translated into [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], contributing to the idea of an essence of "[[Turkishness]]" (''Türklük'') the honour of which came to be protected under [[Legal system of the Republic of Turkey|Turkish law]] until the revision of [[Article 301 (Turkish Penal Code)|article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code]] in April 2008. The most influential of these sources were ''Histoire Générale des Huns, des Turcs, des Mongoles, et autres Tartares Occidenteaux'' (1756–1758) by [[Joseph de Guignes]] (1721–1800), and ''Sketches of Central Asia'' (1867) by [[Ármin Vámbéry]] (1832–1913), which was on the common origins of Turkic groups as belonging to one race, but subdivided according to physical traits and customs, and ''l’histoire de l’Asie'' (1896) by [[Leon Cahun]] (1841–1900), which stressed the role of Turks in "carrying civilization to Europe", as a part of the greater "Turanid race" that included the Uralic and Altaic speaking peoples more generally.&lt;ref&gt;Gülden z Kibris, ''Creating Turkishness: An Examination of Turkish Nationalism through Gök-Börü'', Sabanci University (2005){{cite web |url=http://digital.sabanciuniv.edu/tezler/etezfulltext/kibrisg.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119205732/http://digital.sabanciuniv.edu/tezler/etezfulltext/kibrisg.pdf |archivedate=2010-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an ideology of [[Hungarian Turanism]] most lively in the second half of the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century.

'''uBiome''' is a [[biotechnology]] company based in [[San Francisco]] that has developed key technology to sequence the human [[Microbiota|microbiomes]].  

==History==
The company was founded by Jessica Richman, Zachary Apte, and Will Ludington who were scientists in the [[California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee|first1=Teresa|title=Swabbing for Science|url=http://berkeleysciencereview.com/article/swabbing-for-science/|work=The Berkeley Science Review|date=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 2012, uBiome generated $350,000 through a crowdfunding campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vachelard|first1=J|last2=Gambarra-Soares|first2=T|last3=Augustini|first3=G|last4=Riul|first4=P|last5=Maracaja-Coutinho|first5=V|title=A Guide to Scientific Crowdfunding.|journal=PLOS Biology|date=17 February 2016|volume=14|issue=2|pages=e1002373|pmid=26886064|pmc=4757556|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The founders received mentoring and funding from [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] and further funding from [[ Andreessen Horowitz]] and 8VC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/18/ubiome-raises-4-5m-from-angel-investors-andreessen-horowitz-to-crowdsource-microbiome-research/ |publisher = TechCrunch |last = Chokkattu |first = Julian |title = uBiome Raises $4.5M From Angel Investors, Andreessen Horowitz To Crowdsource Microbiome Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Dillet |first= Romain |title = Andreessen Horowitz Raises Massive New $1.5 Billion Fund |publisher = TechCrunch |url = https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/27/andreessen-horowitz-raises-massive-new-1-5-billion-fund/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/01/gut-health-startup-ubiome-raised-22-million-and-is-launching-a-dna-test-for-your-poop/ | publisher = TechCrunch |last = Buhr| first = Sarah |title = Gut health startup uBiome has raised $15.5 million and is launching a DNA test for your poop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, uBiome offered a $1 million grant program to researchers and citizen scientists for microbiome sampling and related analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/documents/OSTP%20National%20Microbiome%20Initiative%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|title=FACT SHEET: Announcing the National Microbiome Initiative|last=|first=|date=May 13, 2016|website=obamawhitehouse.archives.gov|publisher=The White House|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One winner of the first round of such grants was the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].&lt;ref name=Wired2015&gt;Zhang, Sarah. [https://www.wired.com/2015/11/ubiome-cdc-collaboration/ “Microbiome Startup uBiome Will Sequence Poop for the CDC.”] Wired.

==Products and services==

Customers purchase kits to sample one or more parts of their body, including the gut, genitals, mouth, nose, or skin. After swabbing, a participant takes a survey which is used to make correlations with microbiome data. The participant sends the kit to the company in the mail and receives data in a few weeks; he or she can compare their data with that of uBiome’s data set.&lt;ref name=FastCo&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3039891/gut-check |last=Gertner |first=Jon |title=What's Lurking In Your Microbiome?

== Controversies ==
Amy Dockser Marcus noted in a 2014 essay in The Wall Street Journal that when Ubiome raised its initial round of crowdfunding in early 2013, many questions were raised by [[bioethicists]] about the company's [[citizen science]] business model - namely whether it had actually obtained [[informed consent]] from its customers, and whether [[Genetic_testing#Direct-to-consumer_genetic_testing|direct to consumer genetic testing]] initiatives could be ethically conducted at all, and its lack of [[Institutional review board]] (IRB) approval.&lt;ref name="WSJ2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ethics-of-experimenting-on-yourself-1414170041|title=The Ethics of Experimenting on Yourself|date=24 October 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|last1=Marcus|first1=Amy Dockser}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/urban-scientist/on-ethics-and-self-policing-in-citizen-science/|title=On Ethics and Self-Policing in (Citizen) Science|date=February 22, 2013|work=Scientific American Blog Network|last1=DNLee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Crowdsourced-Research-Delves/141795/|title=Crowdsourced Research Delves, Uncertainly, Into the Human Microbiome|date=23 September 2013|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|last1=Chorost|first1=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wall Street Journal essay also noted that questions were raised about the quality of data obtained in citizen science initiatives, with regard to self-selection and other issues.&lt;ref name=WSJ2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/meet-your-microbes-ubiome-offers-new-service/|title=Meet Your Microbes: uBiome Offers New Service|date=June 25, 2013|work=Science-Based Medicine|last1=Hall|first1=Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xindonga''' is an ethnological term created as a common label for four small ethnic groups existing in the extreme Southeast of [[Angola]]: the Cusso (Mbukushu), the Dilico (or Dirico), the Sambio and the Maxico. These peoples live in that region, which today is the [[Cuando Cubango Province]], together with other small groups, belonging to the [[Owambo people|Ovambo]], [[Ganguela]] and [[San people|San]].&lt;ref&gt;José Redinha, ''Etnias e culturas de Angola'', Luanda: Instituto de Investigação Científica de Angola, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The "Xindonga" peoples are living on petty [[subsistence agriculture]],  keeping small animals, and the occasional hunting and/or fishing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4117">{{short description|ethnic group of Phongsaly Province, Laos}}
The '''Yang people''', also known as the '''Nhang''' or '''Nyang''' (autonym: ''jaŋ13''), are a [[Tai languages|Tai]]-speaking ethnic group of [[Phongsaly Province]], northwestern [[Laos]]. Chazee (1998) reports that they number approximately 5,000 people as of 1995. The Yang are heavily influenced by [[Tai Lü language|Tai Lue]] culture, although the Yang of Namo Nua village, [[Oudomxay]] province are more heavily influenced by [[Tai Dam people]] culture (Chazee 1998:23).

[[Jerold Edmondson]] (1997)&lt;ref&gt;[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/gregerson1997outlying.pdf Outlying Kam-Tai: notes on Ta Mit Laha].&lt;/ref&gt; has reported that the [[Buyang people]] of southern China claim to have relatives in [[Phongsaly]] province, Laos. It is not known whether the Yang of Laos are indeed related to the Buyang of China. The [[Yang Zhuang language|Yang Zhuang]] of southwestern [[Guangxi]], China are also similarly named, as well as some groups in northwestern Vietnam that are called "Nhắng".&lt;ref&gt;Doling, Tim. 2010. ''Mountains and Ethnic Minorities: North West Việt Nam''. Hà Nội: Thế Giới Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
In February 1998, a 300-word basic vocabulary list of the Yang language was documented by Thongphet Kingsada and [[Shintani Tadahiko|Tadahiko Shintani]] in ''Basic vocabularies of the languages spoken in Phongxaly, Lao P.D.R.'' (1999).

==History==
According to Yang elders of Nam Fa village, Vieng Poukha District, the Yang had migrated more than 200 years ago (or more than 4 generations ago) from the [[Dien Bien Phu]] area of northern Vietnam (Chazee 1998:23). Throughout Laos today, the Yang practice paddy cultivation near streams in lowlands and valleys, at elevations of between 400 to 800 meters.

The Yang of Ay village, Namo District claim to have come from the [[Muong Lay|Mường Lay]] and Mường Sô areas of northern Vietnam over 200 years ago, where they were called "Tai Lay" (Chazee 1998:23). 12 Yang families settled in a part of Phongsaly traditionally belonging to the [[Tai Lue]] people. After two Indochinese wars, the Tai Lue returned from China to reclaim their territory, and settled in Khuang village instead, several kilometers away. There were 3 destructive fires in Ay village, in 1940, 1970, and 1991. After 1991, some families left Ay to form the two villages of Ponxay Savan and Somsavanh nearby, believing Ay to be haunted by malevolent spirits from the 1991 fire.

==Distribution==
The Yang are distributed in the following villages of [[Phongsaly]], [[Luang Namtha]], and [[Oudomxay]] provinces (Chazee 1998). Kingsada (1999) covers the Yang (''jaŋ13'') language of Long Ngai Kao village, [[Boun Neua District|Bun Neua District]], [[Phongsaly Province]], Laos.&lt;ref&gt;Kingsadā, Thō̜ngphet, and Tadahiko Shintani. 1999 ''Basic Vocabularies of the Languages Spoken in Phongxaly, Lao P.D.R.'' Tokyo: Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa (ILCAA).&lt;/ref&gt;
