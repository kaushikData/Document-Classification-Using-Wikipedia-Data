In [[Indian religions]] and society, an '''acharya''' ([[IAST]]: {{IAST|''ācārya''}}) is a preceptor or instructor in religious matters; founder, or leader of a sect; or a highly learned person or a title affixed to the names of learned people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Platts|first=John T.|title=A dictionary of Urdu, classical Hindi, and English|publisher=W. H. Allen &amp; Co.|location=London|year=1884|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:1246.platts}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The designation has different meanings in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and secular contexts. It is also a Vishwabrahmin/brahmin surname found in Nepal and across India, including [[Odisha]], [[Karnataka]], [[West Bengal]] and [[Maharashtra]].{{Cn|date=January 2017}}

Acharya is sometimes used to address a teacher or a scholar in any discipline, e.g.: [[Bhaskaracharya]], the mathematician.

==Etymology==
The term "acharya" is most often said to include the root "char" or "charya" (conduct). Thus it literally connotes "one who teaches by conduct (example)", i.e. an exemplar.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

==In Hinduism==
In [[Hinduism]], an ''acharya'' (आचार्य) is a formal title of a teacher or guru, who has attained a degree in Veda and Vedanga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Education in India|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yqtAAgS3NSEC&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author1=Ram Nath Sharma|author2=Rajendra Kumar Sharma|year=1996|publisher=Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=October 2018}}

Prominent acharyas in the  Hindu tradition are as given below :
*[[Adi Sankara]]charya&lt;ref&gt;[viswakarma community] Although famous for being the proponent of ''[[advaita]] vad'', he established the supremecy of ''[[bhakti]]'' to [[Krishn]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ramanuja]]charya&lt;ref&gt;He propagated the ''[[bhakti]]'' of ''[[Bhagwan]]'' ''[[Vishnu]]''. Source: [http://www.jagatguru.in/ramanuj.htm Ramanujacharya] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826200921/http://www.jagatguru.in/ramanuj.htm |date=26 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Madhvacharya]]&lt;ref&gt;His philosophy is called ''[[dvaita]] vad''. His primary teaching is that "the only goal of a soul is to selflessly and wholeheartedly love and surrender to God" Source: [http://www.encyclopediaofauthentichinduism.org/articles/70_saints_acharyas.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Nimbarka]]charya&lt;ref&gt;His writings say that Radha Krishn are the supreme form of God.&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=March 2014}} 
*[[Vallabhacharya]]

*[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]

*[[Sandipani|Acharya Sandipani]]
*[[Bhadreshdas Swami]]

==Buddhism==
In Buddhism, acharya is a senior teacher. Notable acharyas:
* [[Pema Chödrön]] (b. 1936) acharya at [[Gampo Abbey]]&lt;ref name="gampoabbey"&gt;{{cite web

==In Jainism==
{{main|Acharya (Jainism)}}

[[File:Acharya_KundaKunda.jpg|thumb|Image of Āchārya [[Kundakunda]], author of [[Jain texts]] like [[Pancastikayasara]], [[Niyamasara]]]]
In [[Jainism]], an ''acharya'' is the highest leader of a Jain order. ''Acharya'' is one of the [[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]] (five supreme beings) and thus worthy of worship. They are the final authority in the monastic order and has the authority to ordain new monks and nuns. They are also authorized to consecrate new idols, although this authority is sometimes delegated to scholars designated by them.

An acharya, like any other Jain monk, is expected to wander except for the [[Chaturmas]]. [[Bhattaraka|Bhaṭṭāraka]]s, who head institutions, are technically junior monks, and thus permitted to stay in the same place.

==In scientific/mathematical scholarship==
* [[Bhaskaracharya]]
* [[Mahaviracharya]]
* [[Bhaskaracharya I]]

==Acharya (degree)==
In Sanskrit institutions, acharya is a post-graduate degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/33943525/?formInput=acharya%20degree%20equivalent%20to|title=Nandan Mishra vs University Of Delhi &amp; Ors on 12 May, 2015|website=indiankanoon.org|access-date=2017-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10139">'''Ariel Toaff''' (born 1942) is a professor of Medieval and Renaissance History at [[Bar Ilan University]] in Israel, whose work has focused on Jews and their history in Italy. 

He came to international prominence with the 2007 publication of  the first edition of his controversial book ''Pasque Di Sangue'' (''[[Passovers of Blood]]''), in which he claimed historical basis&lt;ref name="Johnson" &gt; Hannah Johnson, ''Blood Libel: The Ritual Murder Accusation at the Limit of Jewish History,''University of Michigan Press,  2012 pp.132ff. p.132.&lt;/ref&gt; for ritual use of human blood, obtained by murder. The claim was criticized as lending support to [[blood libel against Jews|blood libel]], an allegation that modern historians have described as unsupported by facts and which the Catholic Church has similarly repudiated since the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;The Apostolic See and the Jews, Documents: 492-1404; Simonsohn, Shlomo, p. 188-189,193-195,208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/g10-jews.asp 'Gregory X: Letter on Jews, (1271-76) - Against the Blood Libel,']&lt;/ref&gt; Toaff wrote that these critics had misunderstood his book, which argued that the ritual use of small quantities of dried blood in magical curses had been a real practice among medieval "Ashkenazi extremists", but that this was unrelated to the accusation of ritual murder which was the central claim of blood libel.&lt;ref name = "toa"/&gt;

==Biography==
Ariel Toaff is the son of [[Elio Toaff]], late former [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Rome]].

Among his works are ''The Jews in Medieval Assisi 1305-1487: A social and economic history of a small Jewish community'' (1979); ''Il vino e la carne. Una comunità ebraica nel Medioevo'' (''Wine and Meat. A Jewish Community in the Middle Ages'', 1989); ''Mostri giudei. L'immaginario ebraico dal Medioevo alla prima età moderna'' ("Jewish Monsters. The Jewish Imaginary from the Middle Ages to the Early Modern Era", 1996); and ''Mangiare alla giudia. La cucina ebraica in Italia dal Rinascimento all'età moderna'' (''Eating Jewish style. Jewish Cooking in Italy from the Renaissance to the Modern Age'', 2000).

===''Passovers of Blood''===
{{main|Passovers of Blood: The Jews of Europe and Ritual Murders}}
Toaff's book, ''Pasque di sangue. Ebrei d'Europa e omicidi rituali'' ("Passovers of Blood: The Jews of Europe and Ritual Murders"), was published in February 2007. The book analyzes the cultural and historical background to a notorious 1475 murder trial in Italy. A group of Jews were accused of murdering a young boy, later known as [[Simon of Trent]], and using his blood for [[Passover]] rites. The accused were tortured and confessed to killing the boy, who was informally venerated as a saint by Catholics until the 1960s. The consensus of scholarship has dismissed cases such as Simon of Trent's as a [[blood libel against Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;S.Buttaroni, S. Musial (eds.) ''Ritual Murder Legend in European History'', Krakow, Nuremberg, Frankfort, 2003 p.12 reads:'It is important to state from the very beginning that Jewish ritual murder never took place. Today proving such theories wrong is not the goal of scientific research'. Cited Toaff, ''Pasque di sangue'' 2007 p.225 n.2&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book's publication, among other responses, led to calls for Toaff to resign from or be fired from his professorship, and questioning of his research, [[historical method]], and motives&lt;ref&gt;Adi Schwartz, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/832325.html Toaff fights for his good name], in [[Haaretz]], 1 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as they relate to his writing of the book. Threats were made against his life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Blood and Belief: The Circulation of a Symbol Between Jews and Christians |first=David |last=Biale |publisher=University of California Press |location=Los Angeles |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-520-25304-9 |page=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some sought his prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;Ofri Ilani, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/831189.html MKs seek to try Prof. Toaff over claims in blood libel book.'] in  ''Haaretz,'' February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was much criticized for providing material that anti-Semites might capitalize on, though [[Sergio Luzzatto]] praised his intellectual courage in reopening a dossier that had lain under a taboo.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; While Toaff framed his analysis in hypothetical language,  and phrased his speculations in conditional language, the reception of the book often tended to translate this caution, according to Hanna Johnson, into the indicative language of accepted fact.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

Toaff promised not to give in to pressure and defend his work "even if crucified".&lt;ref&gt;Ofri Ilani,[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=824537&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0 , "Bar-Ilan professor who claimed Jews used Christian blood in Passover ceremonies defends his book: 'I will fight for my truth, even if I am crucified'."] in [[Haaretz]], 12 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a statement from Italian Jewish leaders that consumption or use of blood is prohibited by Jewish law and tradition, Toaff stressed that he was not implicating all Jews, but only "a group of fundamentalist Jews [who] did not respect the biblical prohibition [against use of blood]."&lt;ref&gt; The Associated Press and Ofri Ilani Haaretz Service, "[http://www.haaretz.com/news/bar-ilan-to-order-professor-to-explain-research-behind-blood-libel-book-1.212579 Bar-Ilan to order professor to explain research behind blood libel book: Ariel Toaff's book alleges accusations of Jews using Christian blood may be based on real ceremonies]", 11 February 2007; accessed 04 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; However, Toaff did eventually pull his book from circulation. He clarified that in regard to the specific trial, dealing with Jews accused of killing [[Simon of Trent]] for ritual purposes at Passover, there was no relationship whatsoever between the so-called 'ritual of blood' and ritual infanticide. He denied that the Jews implicated were in any way involved in the murder of Simon.&lt;ref&gt;Adi Schwartz [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/957357.html 'Historian recants theory that Jews killed Christian child in ritual murder,'] in ''Haaretz'', 24 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 14, 2007, Toaff said in a statement that he ordered the Italian publisher of his book to freeze distribution of his book so that he can "re-edit the passages which comprised the basis of the distortions and falsehoods that have been published in the media."&lt;ref name=JP024&gt;Matthew Wagner and AP, [https://archive.is/20120708055342/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1170359860024&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull 'Blood libel' author halts press] in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' Feb. 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Sanders,[http://www.forward.com/articles/blood-libel-scholar-pulls-book-pledges-funds-to-a/ Scholar Pulls Book Revisiting Blood Libel - Says Press Distorted His Work, Pledges Proceeds to ADL] in ''[[The Forward]]'', February 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

A second edition of the book appeared in February, 2008. In an afterword to this edition in defense of his book, Toaff responded to his critics. To forestall possible misinterpretations, he said that the idea that Jews practiced ritual murder is a slanderous stereotype, and that ritual homicide or infanticide was a myth. That said, the possibility existed that:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;certain criminal acts, disguised as crude rituals, were indeed committed by extremist groups or by individuals demented by religious mania and blinded by desire for revenge against those considered responsible for their people’s sorrows and tragedies.&lt;ref name = "toa"&gt;[http://www.medievalists.net/files/08111401.pdf Ariel Toaff, 'Trials and Historical Methodology: In Defence of ''Pasque di sangue'',' p. 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
The evidence supporting this hypothesis draws on confessions extracted under torture. His book examines the strong documentary evidence in medieval medical handbooks that dried human blood, traded by both Jewish and Christian merchants, was thought to be medicinally efficacious. Under the stress of forced conversions, expulsions and massacres, Toaff thinks it possible that in certain Ashkenazi groups dried human blood came to play a magical role in calling down God's vengeance on Christians, the historic persecutors of the Jews, and that this reaction may have affected certain forms of ritual practice among a restricted number of Ashkenazi Jews during [[Passover]].&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Toaff, ''Ebraismo Virtuale,''Rizzoli, 2008 pp.101-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is most commonly used as a veneration in addressing or referring to an [[ordination|ordained]] female [[Buddhist]] monk, most often of the [[Theravada]]n tradition in [[Southeast Asia]]. It is sometimes mistaken as equivalent to Christian use of the word, "sister." Ayya can refer to either a [[bhikkhuni]] (fully ordained and usually wearing orange or yellow robes in Southeast Asia) or a [[samaneri]] ([[shramanerika]]) ten-precept novice [[renunciant]] or a [[sikkhamana]] (wearing white, brown or sometimes pink), but not to non-ordained precept-holders.

Generally for bhikkhunis, robes would be maroon with yellow in [[Tibet]]; gray (for [[Mahayana]]ns) or orange/yellow (for Theravadans) in [[Vietnam]]; gray in [[Korea]]; gray or black in [[China]] and [[Taiwan]]; black in [[Japan]]; orange or yellow in Thailand, Sri Lanka, [[Nepal]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Burma]]. The colour of robes distinguishes both level of ordination and tradition, with white (usually worn by a male renunciant before ordination) or pink symbolising a state of ambiguity, being on the threshold of a decision, no longer secular and not yet monastic. A key exception to this is in the countries where women are not allowed to wear robes that signify full ordination, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and (Theravadans in) Vietnam. So, the majority of ayyas wear orange/yellow or white/pink.&lt;ref name="WAiB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Monastic ordination for women in modern Buddhism|url=http://lhamo.tripod.com/4ordin.htm#Monastic%20ordination|website=Women Active in Buddhism (WAiB)|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-establishment of Bhikkhuni lineage==
There are very few fully ordained (bhikkhuni) ayyas in the 21st century because the Theravadan nuns' lineage was lost in most of Southeast Asia over the last 1,000 years. The Theravadan bhikkhuni lineage was reinstated in 1996 at [[Sarnath|Sarnath, India]], by a quorum of Theravada monks and Korean nuns.&lt;ref name="ordina_proc"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bhavanasociety.org/main/page/the_ordination_process/| title=The Ordination Process
| accessdate=2006-09-07|website=Bhavana Society| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061015130303/http://www.bhavanasociety.org/main/page/the_ordination_process/| archivedate= 15 October 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] [[dasa sil mata]] nuns took full bhikkhuni ordination in that ceremony, reviving the Theravada Bhikkhuni Order after 980 years of decline and dissipation. Theravadan ordination is available for women (as of 2006) in [[Sri Lanka]], where many of the current bhikkhunis have been ordained. The [[Sangha (Buddhism)#Women's role in the Sangha|ordination process]] has several stages, which can begin with [[anagarika]] (non-ordained) precepts and wearing white robes, but is as far as many women are allowed to take their practice. In [[Thailand]], where it is illegal for women to take ordination, nearly all female monastics are known as [[maechi]]s (also spelled "[[mae chee]]"), regardless of their level of attainment.

As awareness of the need for ordained women to study and practice grows, so does the support for female monks. There are very few places for an ayya to reside, once she ordains. The number of monasteries and [[vihara]]s for women is still small, but increasing.

'''Bagadates I''' ([[Koine Greek|Greek]]; from the [[Old Iranian]] ''Baga-dāta'', "Given by [the] god"),&lt;ref&gt;Since the Greek equivalent would be [[Theodore (name)|Theodore]], it will be easily understood that there were numerous individuals bearing this name; the name of one who appears briefly in [[Josephus]], ''Jewish War'' is discussed by Tal Ilan and Jonathan J. Price, "Seven Onomastic Problems in Josephus' 'Bellum Judaicum'", ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'' New Series '''84'''.2/3 (October 1993: 189-2) p 196f.&lt;/ref&gt; also '''Bagdates''' or '''Baydad''' ([[Middle Persian]]), was a ''[[frataraka]]'' or [[Zoroastrianism|"Keeper of the Fire"]], and a governor or sub-dynast for the [[Seleucids]], ruling as a priest-king at [[Istakhr]] in the former [[Achaemenid]] heartland, the territory of [[Persis]] ([[Fars Province|Fars]]), after [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests. He was the first indigenous Persian satrap to be appointed - or at least tolerated - by the Seleucids,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/history/seleucids/seleucids.php (History of Iran) Jens Jacobson, "Seleucid Empire" 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; who held the higher administrative posts tightly within the [[Ancient Macedonians|Greco-Macedonian]] circle that was headed by the "Companions" and their heirs.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. W. Walbank]], ''The Hellenistic World'' (Harvard University Press) 1981: "The Seleucids and the East", ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; On the reverse of his coins, Bagadates is depicted standing in front of a Zoroastrian fire-altar, or seated in majesty holding a staff of authority and possibly a [[pomegranate]] in his left hand (''illustration, left''). Bagadates seems to have asserted his independence about 280 BCE, exploiting the turmoil after the death of [[Seleucus I]]. "That the first oriental reaction to [[Macedon]]ian rule should come from Persis, the homeland of the Achaemenids, is hardly surprising," Otto Mørkholm remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Mørkholm 1991:74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The uprising against Seleucid control was continued by Bagadates' son,  '''Oborzos''',&lt;ref&gt;The historian [[Polyaenus]] records a stratagem of Oborzos against Hellene colonists in Persis, noted by Mørkholm , ''op.cit.''.&lt;/ref&gt; who emphasized the continuity by repeating the coinage type established by his father. However, some time during the 3rd century BCE the Seleucids terminated the pseudo-independence of Persis; during the 220s BCE, the satrap there was a Greek named Alexander, a brother of [[Molon]]. Persis finally drifted away from Seleucid control after the [[battle of Magnesia]] in 190 BCE.
[[Image:Baydad.jpg|thumb|left|Another coin of Bagadates]]
In a surviving inscription at [[Amyzon]] in [[Caria]], another '''Bagadates''' was appointed ''neokoros'' of the Temple of Artemis there in 321; it is surmised that his family had been potent landowners in the region before the conquests of Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, in Susan Sherwin-White and Amelie Kuhrt, ''From Samarkand to Sardis: A New Approach to the Seleucid Empire'' (London: Duckworth) 1993; see also P. Briant, "Les iraniens de l'Asie Mineure après la chute de l'empire achéménide", ''Dialogues de l'histoire ancienne'' '''11''' (1985:195).&lt;/ref&gt; The son of this Bagadates, '''Ariaramnēs''',&lt;ref&gt;His name recalls [[Ariaramnes of Persia]], uncle of [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;/ref&gt; succeeded him as ''neokoros'' at Amyzon.

'''Baptismal clothing''' is apparel worn by [[Christian]] proselytes (and in some cases, by [[clergy]] members also) during the ceremony of [[baptism]]. White clothes are generally worn because the person being baptized is "fresh like the driven [[manna]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pomazansky |first=[[Protopresbyter]] Michael |year=1948 |title=Orthodox Dogmatic Theology |page=270 |place=Platina, CA |publisher=Saint Herman of Alaska Brotherhood |id=LOC # 84-051294}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
==Eastern Orthodoxy==
[[File:Окрещённый ребёнок.jpg|thumb|[[Russian Orthodox]] priest, parents, godparents and a newly baptized baby.]]

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] of the [[Byzantine Rite]], the baptismal garment is worn by the newly baptized for eight days, after which there is a special ceremony on the eighth day for the removal of the baptismal robe. For adults, the robe is a long, sleeved garment, similar to the Western [[alb]], tied at the waist usually with a white cloth belt or rope. A woman may also cover her head with a white [[veil]] (usually a simple kerchief). For [[infant baptism]]s, the robe may be a white gown and bonnet, and a white blanket. 

These garments are placed on the newly baptized immediately after coming up out of the waters of baptism (the Orthodox baptize by [[Baptism#Immersion|immersion]], even in the case of infant baptism). As the robe is being placed on the new Christian, the priest says the prayer: "The servant of God, ''N.'', is clothed with the robe of righteousness; in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen." and the choir sings: "Vouchsafe unto me the robe of light, O Thou who clothest Thyself with light as with a garment, Christ our God, plenteous in mercy."

[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir.jpg|thumb|left|''The Baptism of [[Saint Vladimir]]'' in [[Chersonesus]] by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]] (1890). To the left attendants are holding Vladimir's golden royal robes, which he has taken off, and the simple white baptismal robe, which he will put on (1890, fresco from [[St. Vladimir's Cathedral, Kiev|St. Vladimir's Cathedral]], [[Kiev]]).]]

In Orthodox [[theology]] the baptismal robe symbolizes the "Garments of Light" (i.e., the fullness of [[Divine grace]]) with which [[Adam and Eve]] were clothed in the [[Garden of Eden]] before the [[Fall of Man]]. Baptism is believed to cleanse the believer of all the sinful defilements both of [[original sin]] and [[sin|personal sins]]&lt;ref name = "ODT"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pomazansky |first=[[Protopresbyter]] Michael |year=1948 |title=Orthodox Dogmatic Theology |page=270 |place=Platina, CA |publisher=Saint Herman of Alaska Brotherhood |id=LOC # 84-051294}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the white garment is symbolic of this. During the [[ektenia]] (litany) before baptism, the deacon prays "That he (she) may preserve this (her) baptismal garment and the earnest of the Spirit pure and undefiled unto the dead [[Second Coming|Day of Christ our God]]...", referring not so much to the material garment as to the spiritual cleansing it represents.

The newly baptized will traditionally wear their baptismal garment for eight days, especially when receiving [[Holy Communion]]. These are special days of prayer and fasting,&lt;ref name="Hapgood"&gt;
{{Cite book|last=Hapgood |first=Isabel F. |year=1922 |publication-date=1975 |title=Service Book of the Holy Orthodox-Catholic Apostolic Church |edition=5th |page=603 |place=Englewood, N.J. |publisher=Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of which they return to the church for the "Removal of the Robe on the Eighth Day" and [[ablution in Christianity|ablutions]] (in many places today, this ceremony is performed on the same day as the baptism, immediately after [[Chrismation]]). During this ceremony, the priest loosens the belt on the baptismal robe and prays: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"O Thou who, through holy Baptism, hast given unto Thy servant remission of sins, and hast bestowed upon him (her) a life of regeneration: Do Thou, the same Lord and Master, ever graciously illumine his (her) heart with the light of Thy countenance. Maintain the shield of his (her) faith unassailed by the enemy [i.e., Satan]. Preserve pure and unpolluted the garment of incorruption wherewith Thou hast endued him (her), upholding inviolate in him (her), by Thy grace, the seal of the Spirit, and showing mercy unto him (her) and unto us, through the multitude of Thy mercies..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He then sprinkles the newly baptized with water and washes all of the places the [[chrism]] was applied, and performs the [[tonsure]].

Someone who has been baptized as an adult will often be buried in their baptismal robe, if they have not advanced to some higher ministry within the church.

== Roman Catholic tradition ==
[[File:Girl at catholic christening.jpg|thumb|Girl in christening gown being baptized in a [[Roman Catholic]] church.]]

In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], most of those born into the faith are baptized as infants. The traditional clothing for a child being baptized into the Roman Catholic faith is a baptismal  gown, a very long, white infants' [[clothing|garment]] now made especially for the [[ceremony]] of [[infant baptism|christening]] and usually only worn then.  They are in fact the normal, or at least "best", outer clothing of Western babies until about the 19th century.  The moment of progression to shorter dresses (for both [[Breeching (boys)|boys]] and girls) was known as "[[shortcoating]]", which usually coincided with the beginning of crawling, which was difficult in a long robe, or at five to six months of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Leroy M. Yale|title=Babyhood; the Mother's Nursery Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DrgtAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=14 February 2016|volume=4|date=January 1888|publisher=Babyhood Publishing Company|location=New York|page=62|quote=Children are short-coated when they begin to desire to use their legs freely—usually at about six months}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CombeBell1840"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Combe|first1=Andrew|authorlink1=Andrew Combe|last2=Bell|first2=John|title=Treatise on the Physiological and Moral Management of Infancy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZCAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA203|accessdate=14 February 2016|year=1840|publisher=Carey &amp; Hart|page=203|quote=The ordinary long dress of infants is a great impediment to freedom of motion, and it ought, therefore, to be curtailed about the fifth or sixth months...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christening gowns are usually made of fine white [[linen]] or [[cotton]] fabric, and may be [[trim (sewing)|trimmed]] with [[tuck (sewing)|tucks]], [[lace]], [[whitework embroidery]], and other handwork. Baptismal gowns often have matching [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s, and may become family heirlooms, used generation after generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Manscill |first1=D.C. |title=The History of Christening Clothing |url=https://childrensformalattire.com/blog/history-christening-clothing/ |website=Children's Formal Attire |accessdate=14 October 2018 |page=1 |language=English |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protestant tradition ==
===Anglican tradition===
The [[Anglican Communion]] grew from the [[Church of England]] and includes the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]]. It views itself as the unbroken continuation of the early apostolic and later medieval "universal church", rather than as a new institution. 

Many of the early traditions are therefore the same as the [[Roman Catholic]]s and an heirloom long white gown is still used by many families. Modern churches allow for much diversity, but usually the clothing is still white for an infant or young child.

===Other Protestant churches===
[[File:River baptism in New Bern.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A river baptism in [[North Carolina]] at the turn of the 20th century. Both those being baptized and the minister are dressed in white.]]
A wide variety of practices are found in the spectrum of Protestantism. Some mainstream Protestant churches practice infant baptism, and thus make use of the christening gown; while others encourage or practice exclusive [[adult baptism]] also known as believer's baptism. In some of the latter churches, special white clothing may be worn by both the person being baptized and the person performing the baptism.

== Latter-day Saint tradition ==
{{seealso|Baptism (Mormonism)}}
Members of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] dress in white clothing to perform and to undertake baptism. Traditionally, the proselyte wears a white jumpsuit, white socks and white underclothing. The person performing the ordinance wears either a white jumpsuit or white slacks and white shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=LDS Church |title=Clothing for Baptism |url=https://www.lds.org/handbook/handbook-2-administering-the-church/priesthood-ordinances-and-blessings/20.3?lang=eng&amp;_r=1#20.3.6 |website=lds.org |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |accessdate=12 October 2018 |page=20.3.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, women and girls wore white dresses with weights sewn in at the hems to prevent the clothing from floating during the ceremony.

'''Brahmin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɑː|m|ɪ|n}}; [[Sanskrit]]: ब्राह्मण) is a [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] (class) in [[Hinduism]] specialising as priests, teachers ([[acharya]]) and protectors of sacred learning across generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ingold | first=Tim | title=Companion encyclopedia of anthropology | publisher=Routledge | location=London New York | year=1994 | isbn=978-0-415-28604-6 | page=1026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lochtefeld125&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), Brahmin, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8239-3179-8}}, page 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional occupation of Brahmins was that of priesthood at the Hindu temples or at socio-religious ceremonies and rite of passage rituals such as solemnising a wedding with hymns and prayers.&lt;ref name=lochtefeld125/&gt;&lt;ref name=ghurye15/&gt; Theoretically, the Brahmins were the highest ranking of the four social classes.&lt;ref name=doniger141/&gt; In practice, Indian texts suggest that Brahmins were agriculturalists, warriors, traders and have held a variety of other occupations in India.&lt;ref name=ghurye15&gt;GS Ghurye (1969), Caste and Race in India, Popular Prakashan, {{ISBN|978-81-7154-205-5}}, pages 15–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Shulman 1989 page 111"&gt;David Shulman (1989), The King and the Clown, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-00834-9}}, page 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=doniger141&gt;{{cite book | last=Doniger | first=Wendy | title=Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions| publisher=Merriam-Webster | location=Springfield, MA, USA | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-87779-044-0 | pages=141–142, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purusha Sukta===
{{main|Purusha Sukta}}
The earliest inferred reference to "Brahmin" as a possible social class is in the Rigveda, occurs once, and the hymn is called Purusha Sukta.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofancient00mluoft#page/570/mode/2up A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature], Oxford University Press, pages 570–571&lt;/ref&gt; According to this hymn in ''Mandala'' 10, Brahmins are described as having emerged from the mouth of [[Purusha]], being that part of the body from which words emerge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300 |first=Romila |last=Thapar |authorlink=Romila Thapar |publisher=University of California Press |year=2004 |isbn=9780520242258 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5irrXX0apQC&amp;pg=PA125 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Creation Myths |first1=David Adams |last1=Leeming |first2=Margaret Adams |last2=Leeming |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-19510-275-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vetARxZS-bMC&amp;pg=PA139 |pages=139–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|

===Shrauta Sutras===
{{main|Yajna}}
Ancient texts describing community-oriented Vedic yajna rituals mention four to five priests: the hotar, the adhvaryu, the udgatar, the Brahmin and sometimes the ritvij.&lt;ref&gt;Mahendra Kulasrestha (2007), The Golden Book of Upanishads, Lotus, {{ISBN|978-81-8382-012-7}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mohrfear81/&gt; The functions associated with the priests were:
* The ''Hotri'' recites invocations and litanies drawn from the [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref name=hume109/&gt;
* The ''Adhvaryu'' is the priest's assistant and is in charge of the physical details of the ritual like measuring the ground, building the altar explained in the [[Yajurveda]]. The adhvaryu offers oblations.&lt;ref name=hume109&gt;Robert Hume, [https://archive.org/stream/thirteenprincipa028442mbp#page/n127/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3.1], Oxford University Press, pages 107–109&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Udgatri'' is the chanter of hymns set to melodies and music (sāman) drawn from the [[Samaveda]]. The udgatar, like the hotar, chants the introductory, accompanying and benediction hymns.&lt;ref name=hume109/&gt;
* The ''Brahmin'' recites from the [[Atharvaveda]].&lt;ref name=mohrfear81/&gt;
* The ''Ritvij'' is the chief operating priest.&lt;ref name=mohrfear81&gt;Mohr and Fear (2015), World Religions: The History, Issues, and Truth, {{ISBN|978-1-5035-0369-4}}, page 81&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kulkarni, the Grhya-sutras state that [[Yajna]], Adhyayana  (studying the vedas and teaching), dana pratigraha (accepting and giving gifts) are the "peculiar duties and privileges of brahmins".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kulkarni, A.R. | year= 1964| jstor= 44140322 | title=Social and Economic Position of Brahmins in Maharashtra in the Age of Shivaji|journal= Proceedings of the Indian History Congress | volume=26|pages= 66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brahmin and renunciation tradition in Hinduism===
The term Brahmin in Indian texts has signified someone who is good and virtuous, not just someone of priestly class.&lt;ref name=olivelleaab60/&gt; Both Buddhist and Brahmanical literature, states Patrick Olivelle, repeatedly define "Brahmin"  not in terms of family of birth, but in terms of personal qualities.&lt;ref name=olivelleaab60/&gt; These virtues and characteristics mirror the values cherished in Hinduism during the [[Sannyasa]] stage of life, or the life of renunciation for spiritual pursuits. Brahmins, states Olivelle, were the social class from which most ascetics came.&lt;ref name=olivelleaab60&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2011), Ascetics and Brahmins: Studies in Ideologies and Institutions, Anthem, {{ISBN|978-0-85728-432-7}}, page 60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras==
The Dharmasutras and Dharmasatras text of Hinduism describe the expectations, duties and role of Brahmins. The rules and duties in these [[Dharma]] texts of Hinduism, are primarily directed at Brahmins. The [[Gautama's Dharmasutra]], the oldest of surviving Hindu Dharmasutras, for example, states in verse 9.54–9.55 that a Brahmin should not participate or perform a ritual unless he is invited to do so, but he may attend. Gautama outlines the following rules of conduct for a Brahmin, in Chapters 8 and 9:&lt;ref&gt;RC Prasad (2014), The Upanayana: The Hindu Ceremonies of the Sacred Thread&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote box |width=24em | bgcolor=#FFE0BB |align=right |salign = right 
|quote='''Virtues more important than rituals'''&lt;br&gt;
A [Brahmin] man who has performed the forty sacramental rites, but lacks eight virtues does not obtain union with or residence in the same world as [[Brahman]]. A man who may have performed just some rites, but possesses these eight virtues, on the other hand, does.
|source =—''Gautama Dharmasutra'' 9.24–9.25&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-283882-7}}, page 91&lt;/ref&gt;}}

*Be always truthful
*Conduct himself as an [[Aryan]]
*Teach his art only to virtuous men
*Follow rules of ritual purification
*Study Vedas with delight
*Never hurt any living creature
*Be gentle but steadfast
*Have self-control
*Be kind, liberal towards everyone

Chapter 8 of the Dharmasutra, states Olivelle, asserts the functions of a Brahmin to be to learn the Vedas, the secular sciences, the Vedic supplements, the dialogues, the epics and the Puranas; to understand the texts and pattern his conduct according to precepts contained in this texts, to undertake [[Sanskara (rite of passage)]] and rituals, and lead a virtuous life.&lt;ref name=patrickolivelle90&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-283882-7}}, pages 90–91&lt;/ref&gt;

The text lists eight virtues that a Brahmin must inculcate: compassion, patience, lack of envy, purification, tranquility, auspicious disposition, generosity and lack of greed, and then asserts in verse 9.24–9.25, that it is more important to lead a virtuous life than perform rites and rituals, because virtue leads to achieving liberation ([[moksha]], a life in the world of [[Brahman]]).&lt;ref name=patrickolivelle90/&gt;

{{double image|right| Brahmin.jpg|150| Brahmingirl.jpg |145|Left: Brahmin woman, Right: Brahmin girl&lt;br&gt;(both paintings by Lady Lawley, 1914)}}
The later Dharma texts of Hinduism such as Baudhayana Dharmasutra add charity, modesty, refraining from anger and never being arrogant as duties of a Brahmin.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-283882-7}}, pages 136–137&lt;/ref&gt; The Vasistha Dharmasutra in verse 6.23 lists discipline, austerity, self-control, liberality, truthfulness, purity, Vedic learning, compassion, erudition, intelligence and religious faith as characteristics of a Brahmin.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-283882-7}}, pages 267–268&lt;/ref&gt; In 13.55, the Vasistha text states that a Brahmin must not accept weapons, poison or liquor as gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-283882-7}}, page 284&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dharmasastras such as Manusmriti, like Dharmsutras, are codes primarily focussed on how a Brahmin must live his life, and their relationship with a king and warrior class.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-517146-4}}, pages 16, 62–65&lt;/ref&gt; Manusmriti dedicates 1,034 verses, the largest portion, on laws for and expected virtues of Brahmins.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-517146-4}}, pages 41, for specific examples see 132–134&lt;/ref&gt; It asserts, for example,

{{Quote|
A well disciplined Brahmin, although he knows just the Savitri verse, is far better than an undisciplined one who eats all types of food and deals in all types of merchandise though he may know all three Vedas.
|[[Manusmriti]] 2.118|Translated by Patrick Olivelle&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-517146-4}}, page 101&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Bussanich states that the ethical precepts set for Brahmins, in ancient Indian texts, are similar to Greek virtue-ethics, that "Manu's dharmic Brahmin can be compared to Aristotle's man of practical wisdom",&lt;ref&gt;John Bussanich (2014), Ancient Ethics (Editors: Jörg Hardy and George Rudebusch), Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, {{ISBN|978-3-89971-629-0}}, pages 38, 33–52, Quote: "Affinities with Greek virtue ethics are also noteworthy. Manu's dharmic Brahmin can be compared to Aristotle's man of practical wisdom, who exercises moral authority because he feels the proper emotions and judges difficult situations correctly, when moral rules and maxims are unavailable".&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the virtuous Brahmin is not unlike the Platonic-Aristotelian philosopher" with the difference that the latter was not sacerdotal.&lt;ref&gt;John Bussanich (2014), Ancient Ethics (Editors: Jörg Hardy and George Rudebusch), Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, {{ISBN|978-3-89971-629-0}}, pages 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to Abraham Eraly, "Brahmin as a varna hardly had any presence in historical records before the Gupta Empire era" (3rd century to 6th century CE), and "no Brahmin, no sacrifice, no ritualistic act of any kind ever, even once, is referred to in any Indian text" dated to be from the first century CE or before.&lt;ref name=eraly283&gt;Abraham Eraly (2011), The First Spring: The Golden Age of India, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0-670-08478-4}}, page 283&lt;/ref&gt; Their role as priests and repository of sacred knowledge, as well as their importance in the practice of Vedic Shrauta rituals grew during the Gupta Empire era and thereafter.&lt;ref name=eraly283/&gt; However, the knowledge about actual history of Brahmins or other varnas of Hinduism in and after 1st-millennium is fragmentary and preliminary, with little that is from verifiable records or archeological evidence, and much that is constructed from a-historical Sanskrit works and fiction. Michael Witzel writes,

{{Quote|
'''Toward a history of the Brahmins''': Current research in the area is fragmentary. The state of our knowledge of this fundamental subject is preliminary, at best. Most Sanksrit works are a-historic or, at least, not especially interested in presenting a chronological account of India's history. When we actually encounter history, such as in ''Rajatarangini'' or in the ''Gopalavamsavali'' of Nepal, the texts do not deal with brahmins in great detail.

===Normative occupations===
[[File:(A) Bhumi Puja, yajna.jpg|thumb|Brahmins in white dress performing the Bhumi Puja ritual [[yajna]] around fire]]
The Gautama Dharmasutra states in verse 10.3 that it is obligatory on a Brahmin to learn and teach the Vedas.&lt;ref name=olivelleds94&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-283882-7}}, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter 10 of the text, according to Olivelle translation, states that he may impart Vedic instructions to a teacher, relative, friend, elder, anyone who offers exchange of knowledge he wants, or anyone who pays for such education.&lt;ref name=olivelleds94/&gt; The Chapter 10 adds that a Brahmin may also engage in agriculture, trade, lend money on interest, while Chapter 7 states that a Brahmin may engage in the occupation of a warrior in the times of adversity.&lt;ref name=olivelleds94/&gt;&lt;ref name=olivelleds89/&gt; Typically, asserts Gautama Dharmasutra, a Brahmin should accept any occupation to sustain himself but avoid the occupations of a [[Shudra]], but if his life is at stake a Brahmin may sustain himself by accepting occupations of a Shudra.&lt;ref name=olivelleds89&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-283882-7}}, page 89&lt;/ref&gt; The text forbids a Brahmin from engaging in the trade of animals for slaughter, meat, medicines and milk products even in the times of adversity.&lt;ref name=olivelleds89/&gt;

The Apastamba Dharmasutra asserts in verse 1.20.10 that trade is generally not sanctioned for Brahmins, but in the times of adversity he may do so.&lt;ref name=olivelleds31/&gt; The chapter 1.20 of Apastamba, states Olivelle, forbids the trade of the following under any circumstances: human beings, meat, skins, weapons, barren cows, sesame seeds, pepper, and merits.&lt;ref name=olivelleds31&gt;Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-283882-7}}, page 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st millennium CE Dharmasastras, that followed the Dharmasutras contain similar recommendations on occupations for a Brahmin, both in prosperous or normal times, and in the times of adversity.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-517146-4}}, pages 124–126&lt;/ref&gt; The widely studied Manusmriti, for example, states:

{{Quote|
Except during a time of adversity, a Brahmin ought to sustain himself by following a livelihood that causes little or no harm to creatures. He should gather wealth just sufficient for his subsistence through irreproachable activities that are specific to him, without fatiguing his body. – 4.2–4.3

He must never follow a worldly occupation for the sake of livelihood, but subsist by means of a pure, upright and honest livelihood proper to a Brahmin. One who seeks happiness should become supremely content and self controlled, for happiness is rooted in contentment and its opposite is the root of unhappiness. – 4.11–4.12
|Manusmriti|Translated by Patrick Olivelle&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-517146-4}}, page 124&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Ascetic.jpg|thumb|160px|An ascetic from renunciation tradition (1914)]]
The Manusmriti recommends that a Brahmin's occupation must never involve forbidden activities such as producing or trading poison, weapons, meat, trapping birds and others.&lt;ref name=olivellems211/&gt; It also lists six occupations that it deems proper for a Brahmin: teaching, studying, offering yajna, officiating at yajna, giving gifts and accepting gifts.&lt;ref name=olivellems211&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-517146-4}}, pages 125, 211–212&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, states Manusmriti, three which provide a Brahmin with a livelihood are teaching, officiating at yajna, and accepting gifts.&lt;ref name=olivellems212&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-517146-4}}, page 212&lt;/ref&gt; The text states that teaching is best, and ranks the accepting of gifts as the lowest of the six.&lt;ref name=olivellems211/&gt; In the times of adversity, Manusmriti recommends that a Brahmin may live by engaging in the occupations of the warrior class, or agriculture or cattle herding or trade.&lt;ref name=olivellems212/&gt; Of these, Manusmriti in verses 10.83–10.84 recommends a Brahmin should avoid agriculture if possible because, according to Olivelle translation, agriculture "involves injury to living beings and dependence of others" when the plow digs the ground and injures the creatures that live in the soil.&lt;ref name=olivellems212/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Olivelle (2011), Ascetics and Brahmins: Studies in Ideologies and Institutions, Anthem, {{ISBN|978-0-85728-432-7}}, page 39&lt;/ref&gt; However, adds Manusmriti, even in the times of adversity, a Brahmin must never trade or produce poison, weapons, meat, soma, liquor, perfume, milk and milk products, molasses, captured animals or birds, beeswax, sesame seeds or roots.&lt;ref name=olivellems212/&gt;

According to Haidar and Sardar, in the Islamic sultanates of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region, and unlike the Mughal Empire, Telugu [[Niyogi]] Brahmins served the Muslim sultans in many different roles such as accountants, ministers, revenue administration and in judicial service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haidar|first1=Navina Najat|last2=Sardar|first2=Marika|title=Sultans of Deccan Indian 1500–1700|date=2015|publisher=Museum Of Metropolitan Art |location=New Haven, CT, USA|isbn=978-0-300-21110-8|pages=11–12|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oi4nBwAAQBAJ |accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Deccan sultanates]] also heavily recruited [[Maharashtrian Brahmin|Marathi Brahmins]] at different levels of their administration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Stewart|title=Cambridge History of India: The Marathas 1600-1818|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-26883-7|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iHK-BhVXOU4C&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=marathi++nizamshahi+stewart+gordon#v=onepage&amp;q=deshastha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the days of [[Maratha Empire]] in the 17th and 18th century, the occupation of [[Maharashtrian Brahmin|Marathi Brahmins]] ranged from administration, being warriors to being de facto rulers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SYOSHaZnBy8C&amp;pg=PA129 |title=The Satara Raj, 1818–1848: A Study in History, Administration, and Culture - Sumitra Kulkarni |date= |accessdate=2013-03-23|isbn=978-81-7099-581-4 |year=1995 |author1=Kulkarni |first1=Sumitra }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285248/India/46988/Rise-of-the-peshwas |title=India : Rise of the peshwas - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2011-11-08 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the collapse of Maratha empire, Brahmins in Maharashtra region were quick to take advantage of opportunities opened up by the new British rulers.They were the first community to take up Western education and therefore dominated lower level of British administration in the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanlon|first1=Rosilind|title=Caste, Conflict and Ideology: Mahatma Jotirao Phule and low caste protest in nineteenth-century Western India|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0 521 52308 7|pages=122–123|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5kMrsTj1NeYC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=phule+vedas#v=onepage&amp;q=phule%20vedas&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Nepalese Hindus, for example, Niels Gutschow and Axel Michaels report the actual observed professions of Brahmins from 18th- to early 20th-century included being temple priests, minister, merchants, farmers, potters, masons, carpenters, coppersmiths, stone workers, barbers, gardeners among others.&lt;ref&gt;Niels Gutschow and Axel Michaels (2008), Bel-Frucht und Lendentuch: Mädchen und Jungen in Bhaktapur Nepal, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, pages 23 (table), for context and details see 16–36&lt;/ref&gt;

Other 20th-century surveys, such as in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], recorded that the primary occupation of almost all Brahmin families surveyed was neither priestly nor Vedas-related, but like other varnas, ranged from crop farming (80 per cent of Brahmins), dairy, service, labour such as cooking, and other occupations.&lt;ref name=noormohammad45/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramesh Bairy (2010), Being Brahmin, Being Modern, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-58576-7}}, pages 86–89&lt;/ref&gt; The survey reported that the Brahmin families involved in agriculture as their primary occupation in modern times plough the land themselves, many supplementing their income by selling their labor services to other farmers.&lt;ref name=noormohammad45&gt;Noor Mohammad (1992), New Dimensions in Agricultural Geography, Volume 3, Concept Publishers, {{ISBN|81-7022-403-9}}, pages 45, 42–48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G Shah (2004), Caste and Democratic Politics in India, Anthem, {{ISBN|978-1-84331-085-3}}, page 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Other medieval era Brahmins who led spiritual movement without social or gender discrimination included [[Andal]] (9th-century female poet), [[Basava]] (12th-century Lingayatism), [[Dnyaneshwar]] (13th-century Bhakti poet), [[Vallabha Acharya]] (16th-century Vaishnava poet), among others.&lt;ref&gt;John Stratton Hawley (2015), A Storm of Songs: India and the Idea of the Bhakti Movement, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-674-18746-7}}, pages 304–310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rachel McDermott (2001), Singing to the Goddess: Poems to Kālī and Umā from Bengal, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-19-513434-6}}, pages 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/may2005/engpdf/mahima_dharma_bhima_bhoi_biswanathbaba.pdf "Mahima Dharma, Bhima Bhoi and Biswanathbaba"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224314/http://www.orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/may2005/engpdf/mahima_dharma_bhima_bhoi_biswanathbaba.pdf |date=26 September 2007 }}, An Orissa movement by Brahmin Mukunda Das (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many 18th and 19th century Brahmins are credited with religious movements that criticised [[idolatry]].

According to a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' report, an estimated 65 percent of the Brahmin households in India, with about 40 million people, lived on less than $100 a month in 2004; this number dropped to about 50% in 2007.&lt;ref name=bellmanwsj/&gt; Brahmins have also included wealthier and politically successful members.&lt;ref&gt;P Mishra (2002), Temptations of the West: How to Be Modern in India, Pakistan, Tibet, and Beyond, Macmillan, {{ISBN|978-0-312-42641-5}}, page 179&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Buddhist and Jaina texts==
The term Brahmin appears extensively in ancient and medieval [[Sutra]]s and commentary texts of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]]. In Buddhist Pali Canon, such as the ''[[Majjhima Nikaya]]'' and ''Devadaha Sutta'', first written down about 1st century BCE,&lt;ref name="lopez2004busc1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Lopez |title=Buddhist Scriptures |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Pd-2IIzip4C |year=2004|publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-190937-0 |pages=xi–xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Buddha is attributed to be mentioning Jain Brahmins and ascetics, as he describes their [[karma]] doctrine and ascetic practices:&lt;ref name= Balcerowicz149/&gt;

{{Quote|
The Blessed One [Buddha] said,&lt;br&gt;
"There are, o monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who speak thus and are of such opinion: 'Whatever a particular person experiences, whether pleasant or painful, or neither pleasant nor painful, all this has (...) Thus say, o monks, those free of bonds [Jainas].&lt;br&gt;

Brahmins have been part of the Royal tradition of [[Thailand]], particularly for the consecration and to mark annual land fertility rituals of Buddhist kings.

'''Buddhism in Afghanistan''' was one of the major religious forces in the region during [[Pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan|pre-Islamic era]]. The religion was widespread south of the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains. [[Buddhism]] first arrived in [[Afghanistan]] in 305 BC when the Greek [[Seleucid Empire]] made an alliance with the Indian [[Maurya Empire]]. The resulting [[Greco-Buddhism]] flourished under the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] (250 BC-125 BC) and the later [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] (180 BC - 10 AD) in modern northern Pakistan and [[Afghanistan]]. Greco-Buddhism reached its height under the [[Kushan Empire]], which used the Greek alphabet to write its [[Bactrian language]].

The [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] King [[Menander I]], ([[Pāli|Pali]]) "Milinda," ruled 165 BC - 135 BC, was a renowned patron of Buddhism immortalized in the Buddhist text the [[Milinda Panha]]. 

The famous Persian Buddhist monastery in [[Balkh]] in northern Afghanistan, known as [[Nava Vihara]] ("New Monastery"), functioned as the center of [[Buddhism in Central Asia|Central Asia Buddhist]] learning for centuries.

The Buddhist religion in Afghanistan started fading with the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|arrival of Islam]] in the 7th century but finally ended during the [[Ghaznavids]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/history-culture/buddhism-in-mongolia-central-asia/history-of-buddhism-in-afghanistan|title=History of Buddhism in Afghanistan|last = Berzin|first=Alexander|date=December 2006|accessdate=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|Pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan|Islamic conquest of Afghanistan}}
The territory within the borders of Afghanistan has seen many cultural and religious shifts over the centuries. The geographical position of the area between the Middle East, South Asian, and Central Asian cultures, and the proximity to the famous [[Silk Road]] (connecting East Asian and Mediterranean civilizations, and others in between), have been major drivers of local historical and cultural developments. One major influence was the conquest of the area by [[Alexander the Great]], which incorporated the area for a time into the Hellenistic World, and resulted in a strong Hellenistic influence on Buddhist religious art in that region. In 305 BC, the [[Seleucid Empire]] made an alliance with the Indian [[Maurya Empire]]. The Mauryans brought [[Buddhism]] from India and controlled the area south of the Hindu Kush until about 185 BC when they were overthrown.{{Quote|''Alexander took these away from the [[Aryan]]s and established settlements of his own, but [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus Nicator]] gave them to [[Chandragupta Maurya|Sandrocottus]] ([[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]]), upon terms of intermarriage and of receiving in exchange 500 elephants.''&lt;ref name=Dupree-name&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aisk.org/aisk/NHDAHGTK05.php |title=An Historical Guide to Kabul – The Name |author=Nancy Hatch Dupree / Aḥmad ʻAlī Kuhzād |publisher=American International School of Kabul |year=1972 |accessdate=September 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830031416/http://www.aisk.org/aisk/NHDAHGTK05.php |archivedate=August 30, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Strabo]]|64 BC – 24 AD}}
[[File:Mes Aynak stupa.jpg|thumb|[[Mes Aynak]] stupa]]
At the time of these developments, most of the area belonged to the kingdoms of [[Bactria]] and [[Sogdiana]], including the [[Scythians]], followed [[Buddhism]] until the arrival of Islam.

Many monuments testify to the Buddhist culture in present-day Afghanistan. Greek cultural and artistic influence in the region can be researched under [[Buddhist art]] and  [[Greco-Buddhism]]. Additional historical detail can be researched under [[Pre Islamic Hindu and Buddhist heritage of Afghanistan]] and [[Hinduism in Afghanistan]].

Soon after the [[Sassanian]] Persian dynasty fell to the Muslims (in 651 AD), the Nava Vihara monastery in Balkh came under Muslim rule (in 663 AD), but the monastery continued to function for at least another century. In 715 AD, after an insurrection in Balkh was crushed by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], many Persian Buddhist monks fled east along the [[Silk Road]] to the Buddhist [[Kingdom of Khotan]], which spoke a related [[Saka language|Eastern Iranian language]], and onward into China. Nava Vihara's hereditary administrators, the Persian [[Barmakids]], converted from Buddhism to Islam after the monastery's conquest and became powerful viziers under the [[Abbassid]] [[caliphs]] of Baghdad. The last of the family's line of viziers, [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]], is a protagonist in many tales from the [[Arabian Nights]]. In folktales and [[Jafar (Aladdin)|popular culture Ja'far]] has been associated with a knowledge of mysticism, sorcery, and traditions lying outside the realm of Islam.

The Buddhist religion survived the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan]] by the [[Umayyad]]s and rule by the [[Abbasid]] Caliphate. Buddhism in Afghanistan was effectively removed by the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]], [[Ghaznavids]], and [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Bamiyan monastery library===
One of the [[early Buddhist schools]], the [[Mahāsāṃghika]]-[[Lokottaravāda]], were known to be prominent in the area of Bamiyan.

'''Dhupa''' (धुप) is, in [[Indian religions]] (such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], etc.), the ritual offering of [[Incense of India|incense]] during [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] to an image of a deity, or other object of veneration. It is also the [[Sanskrit]] word for incense or perfume itself.

[[Thai language|Thai]] language also borrows this word from Sanskrit to call [[joss sticks]] or [[incense sticks]], by omitting "a" in the word ''Dhupa''. So, the word retains the Sanskrit form when it is written in Thai alphabet as "Dhup" (ธูป). However, Sanskrit's Dh ({{IPA-sa|d̪ʱ|}}) is pronounced as aspirated T {{IPA-th|tʰ|}} in Thai, the word is normally pronounced or transliterated as "Thup" ({{IPA-th|tʰûːp|}})''. Incense burning before images, in temples and during prayer practice is also found in many parts of Asia, among followers of Jainism, Sikhism, Buddhism and Taoism.

The very idea of offering ''dhupa'' is personified in the [[dakini]] ''Dhupa'', who is said in the [[Bardo Thödol]] to appear on the third day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yoniversum.nl/dakini/dak8bodh.html|title=Eight Bodhisattva Dakinis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eva Hesse''' (January 11, 1936 – May 29, 1970), was a German-born American sculptor, known for her pioneering work in materials such as [[latex]], [[fiberglass]], and plastics. She is one of the artists who ushered in the [[postminimal]] art movement in the 1960s. &lt;!-- Citation still needed for exact birth and death date--&gt;

==Life==
Hesse was born into a family of [[Judaism|observant Jews]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany, on January 11, 1936.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Biography|year=2004|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|pages=365–367|edition=2nd|ref=Gale Virtual Reference Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SFMOMA exhibit notes, 2002 for Hamburg; Danto 2006, p.32 for family being observant Jews.&lt;/ref&gt; When Hesse was two years old in December 1938, her parents, hoping to flee from [[Nazi Germany]], sent Hesse and her older sister, Helen Hesse Charash, to the Netherlands to escape Nazi Germany, aboard one of the last [[Kindertransport]] trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sutton|first1=Benjamin|title=Finally, a Documentary About Eva Hesse’s Life and Work|url=https://hyperallergic.com/207327/finally-a-documentary-about-eva-hesses-life-and-work/|website=hyperallergic|publisher=hyperallergic|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Corby, {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GpKjAQFlBI8C&amp;pg=PA133|title=Eva Hesse: Longing, Belonging and Displacement|pages=133–37|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2012-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Hesse graduated from New York's [[School of Industrial Art]] at the age of 16, and in 1952 she enrolled in the [[Pratt Institute]] of Design. She dropped out only a year later.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; When Hesse was 18, she interned at ''Seventeen'' magazine. During this time she also took classes at the [[Art Students League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-hesse-eva.htm|title=The Art Story|website=The Art Story|access-date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1954-57 she studied at [[Cooper Union]] and in 1959 she received her BA from Yale University.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; While at Yale, Hesse studied under [[Josef Albers]] and was heavily influenced by [[Abstract Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFMOMA&gt;SFMOMA exhibit notes, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|title=Josef Albers, Eva Hesse, and the Imperative of Teaching  {{!}} Tate|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/07/josef-albers-eva-hesse-and-the-imperative-of-teaching|website=www.tate.org.uk|accessdate=11 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Yale, Hesse returned to New York, where she became friends with many other young minimalist artists, including [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nemser|first1=Cindy|title=My Memories of Eva Hesse|journal=Woman's Art Journal|date=2007|volume=28|issue=Spring-Summer|page=27|publisher=Old City Publishing, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her close friendship with Sol LeWitt continued until the end of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blantonmuseum.org/exhibitions/details/2286|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2014-08-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817124820/http://blantonmuseum.org/exhibitions/details/2286|archivedate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two frequently wrote to one another, and in 1965 LeWitt famously counseled a young doubting Eva to "Stop [thinking] and just DO!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S+ Stimulant: Sol LeWitt's advice to Eva Hessa Hesse|url=http://magazine.seymourprojects.com/2013/02/s-stimulant-sol-lewitts-advice-to-eva-hesse/|website=Seymour Magazine|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hesse and LeWitt went on to become influential artists, and their friendship aided in the artistic development of each of their works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Samantha|title=Converging Lines: Eva Hesse and Sol LeWitt|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2014/04/art_books/converging-lines-eva-hesse-and-sol-lewitt|website=The Brooklyn Rail Critical Perspectives on Arts, Politics, and Culture|publisher=Yale University Press|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Eva Hesse married fellow sculptor Tom Doyle, and in 1965, the two moved to Germany so that Doyle could pursue an artist residency from German industrialist and collector Friedrich Arnhard Scheidt.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; Hesse and Doyle, whose marriage was falling apart,&lt;ref&gt;Lippard 1992, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; lived and worked in an abandoned textile mill in the [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr]] region of Germany for about a year. Hesse was not happy to be back in Germany,&lt;ref name="Lippard 1992, p. 24"&gt;Lippard 1992, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; but began working with materials that had been left behind in the abandoned factory. Their studio was set up in a disused part of Friedrich Arnhard Scheidt's textile factory in [[Kettwig|Kettwig-on-the-Ruhr]] near [[Essen]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The building still contained machine parts, tools, and materials from its previous use and the angular forms of these disused machines and tools served as inspiration for Hesse’s mechanical drawings and paintings.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  Her first sculpture was a relief titled'' Ring Around Arosie'' featured cloth-covered cord, electrical wire, and [[masonite]].&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; This year in Germany marked a turning point in Hesse's career. From this point on she would continue to make sculptures, which became the primary focus of her work. Returning to New York City in 1965, she began working and experimenting with the unconventional materials that would become characteristic of her work: [[latex]], [[fiberglass]], and plastic.&lt;ref name="tate.org.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartscouncil.org/artists/eva-hesse/|title=Eva Hesse - The Arts Council|website=The Arts Council|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods, materials, and processes==
Hesse's early work (1960–65) consisted of abstract drawings and paintings.&lt;ref name="EWB3657"/&gt; She is most well known for her sculptures and because of this, her drawings are often regarded as preliminary steps to her later work.&lt;ref name="Corby12"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corby|first1=Vanessa|title=New Encounters: Arts, Cultures, Concepts: Eva Hesse: Longing, Belonging and Displacement|date=2010|publisher=Tauris|location=London|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She created her drawings as a separate body of work. She states, "They were related because they were mine but they weren’t related in one completing the other."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corby|first1=Vanessa|title=New Encounters: Arts, Cultures, Concepts: Eva Hesse: Longing, Belonging, and Displacement|date=2010|publisher=Tauris|location=London, UK|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hesse’s interest in latex as a medium for sculptural forms had to do with immediacy. Keats states, "immediacy may be one of the prime reasons Hesse was attracted to latex".&lt;ref name="Mar 2011"/&gt; Hesse’s first two works using latex, ''Schema'' and ''Sequel'' (1967–68) use latex in a way never imagined by the manufacturer. "Industrial latex was meant for casting. Hesse handled it like house paint, brushing layer upon layer to build up a surface that was smooth yet irregular, ragged at the edges like deckled paper." &lt;ref name="Mar 2011"/&gt;

Hesse's work often employs multiple forms of similar shape organized together in grid structures or clusters. Retaining some of the defining forms of minimalism, modularity, and unconventional materials, she created eccentric work that was repetitive and labor-intensive. Her work "Contingent" from 1968 is an ideal example of this concept. In a statement of her work, Hesse describes her piece titled ''Hang-Up'', "It was the first time my idea of absurdity or extreme feeling came through...The whole thing is absolutely rigid, neat cord around the entire thing . . . It is extreme and that is why I like it and don't like it . . . It is the most ridiculous structure that I ever made and that is why it is really good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Irving|title=Art of The Postmodern Era|date=1996|publisher=HarperCollins|location=NY|isbn=0-06-438509-4|page=29|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postminimalism and feminism==
Eva Hesse is associated with the [[postminimal]] [[art movement]]; one of the first artists who moved from [[minimalism]] to [[postminimalism]]. [[Arthur Danto]] distinguished post-minimalism from minimalism by its "mirth and jokiness" and "unmistakable whiff of eroticism," its "nonmechanical repetition".&lt;ref name=Danto-33&gt;Danto, 2006, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

She worked and sometimes competed with her male counterparts in post-minimalist art, a primarily male-dominated movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stoops|first1=Susan|title=More Than Minimal: Feminism and Abstraction in the 70's|year=1996|publisher=Brandeis University|location=Waltham, MA|pages=54–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many feminist art historians have noted her work successfully illuminates women’s issues while refraining from any obvious political agenda. She revealed, in a letter to Ethelyn Honig (1965), that a woman is "at disadvantage from the beginning… She lacks conviction that she has the ‘right’ to achievement. She also lacks the belief that her achievements are worthy”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art|last=Stiles|first=Kristine|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|location=Berkeley, CA|page=705}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to explain that, “a fantastic strength is necessary and courage. I dwell on this all the time. My determination and will are strong but I am lacking so in self-esteem that I never seem to overcome”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She denied her work was strictly feminist, defending it as feminine but without feminist statements in mind. In an interview with Cindy Nemser for ''Woman's Art Journal'' (1970), she states, "Excellence has no sex."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nemser|first1=Cindy|title=My Memories of Eva Hesse|journal=Woman's Art Journal|date=2007|volume=28|issue=1|page=27|publisher=Old City Publishing, Inc.|jstor=20358108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual and critical analysis==
Hesse's work often shows minimal physical manipulation of a material while simultaneously completely transforming the meaning it conveys. This simplicity and complexity has evoked controversy among art historians. Debate has focussed pieces are to be considered complete and finished works, and which are studies, sketches, or models for future works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwabsky|first1=Barry|title=Eva Hesse|journal=Artforum|date=2010|issue=April|pages=205–206|publisher=Camden Arts Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hesse's drawings have been noted as precursory drafts to later sculptures, but Hesse herself disavowed any strong connection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her work is often described as anti-form, a term that describes the resistance to uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danto|first1=Arthur|title=All About Eva|journal=The Nation|date=2006|volume=24|issue=July|pages=30–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work embodies elements of minimalism in its simple shapes, delicate lines, and limited color palette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fer|first1=Briony|title=Bordering on Blank: Eva Hesse and Minimalism|date=1994|volume=17|issue=3|pages=424–449|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Oxford|issn=0141-6790|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8365.1994.tb00586.x|journal=Art History}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Schwabsky]] described her work for the Camden Arts Centre in London, "Things folded, things piled, things twisted, things wound and unwound; tangled things, blunt things to connect to; materials that have a congealed look, materials that seem lost or discarded or mistreated; shapes that look like they should have been made of flesh and shapes, that look like they might be made of flesh but should not have been – you can look at these things, these materials, these shapes, and feel the shudder of an unnamable nanosensation, or you can let your eye pass by them without reaction; maybe you can do both at once."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schwabsky|first1=Barry|title=Eva Hesse|journal=Artforum|date=2010|issue=April|page=206|publisher=Camden Arts Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of her work, and especially her drawings, are based on repetition and simple progressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Ellen|title=Eva Hesse|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/hesse-untitled-t04151|website=Tate Britain|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation of artworks==
Eva Hesse’s sculptures have been the subject of debate during attempts to understand how to preserve the pieces that have been deteriorating with the passage of time. Except for fiberglass, most of her favored materials age badly, so much of her work presents conservators with an enormous challenge. [[Arthur Danto]], writing of the Jewish Museum's 2006 retrospective, refers to "the discolorations, the slackness in the membrane-like latex, the palpable aging of the material… Yet, somehow the work does not feel tragic. Instead, it is full of life, of eros, even of comedy… Each piece in the show vibrates with originality and mischief."&lt;ref&gt;Danto, 2006, p.30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, her work is damaged beyond presentation. For instance, ''Sans III'' can no longer be exhibited to the public because the latex boxes have curled in on themselves and crumbled. Hesse’s close friend [[Sol LeWitt]] argued for steps for active conservation, "She wanted her work to last ... She certainly didn't have the attitude that she would mutely sit by and let it disintegrate before her eyes."&lt;ref name="Mar 2011"&gt;Keats, John. "The Afterlife of Eva Hesse." Art &amp; Antiques Magazine. Art &amp; Antiques Magazine, March 31, 2011; accessed March 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; LeWitt's response is supported by many of Hesse’s other friends and colleagues. However, Hesse’s dedication to material and process contradicts her intention for these works to attain permanency. When discussing this topic with collectors in mind, she wrote, "At this point, I feel a little guilty when people want to buy it. I think they know but I want to write them a letter and say it's not going to last. I am not sure what my stand on lasting really is. Part of me feels that it’s superfluous and if I need to use rubber that is more important. Life doesn’t last; art doesn't last."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danto|first1=Arthur|title=All About Eva|journal=The Nation|date=2006|volume=17|issue=24|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Her art is often viewed in the context of the many struggles of her life. This includes escaping from the Nazis, her parents' divorce, the suicide of her mother when she was 10, her failed marriage, and the death of her father. A 2016 documentary entitled ''Eva Hesse'', premiered in New York, illustrated her painful background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeplanetnetwork.com/news/shoot/portrait-artist-young-woman-documenting-innovation-and-influence-eva-hesse/614744|title=Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman: Documenting the Innovation and Influence of Eva Hesse|last=Wolfe|first=Jennifer|date=2016-06-27|publisher=Creative Planet Network|accessdate=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directed by Marcie Begleiter, the film tells the story of Hesse's "tragically foreshortened life". It "focuses on those years of artistic emergence, a period of rapid development and furious productivity, with few parallels in the history of art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/movies/review-eva-hesse-documentary.html|title=Review: 'Eva Hesse' Offers a Moving Portrait of an Artist's Brief Life|last=Scott|first=A.O.|date=2016-04-26|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While experiences no doubt had profound impressions on Hesse, the true impact of her artwork has been her formal, artistic invention. For example, her inventive uses of material, her contemporary response to the [[minimalist]] movement, and her ability to usher in the postmodern and postminimalist art movements. Arthur Dano connects the two by describing her as "cop[ing] with emotional chaos by reinventing sculpture through aesthetic insubordination, playing with worthless material amid the industrial ruins of a defeated nation that, only two decades earlier, would have murdered her without a second thought."&lt;ref name=Danto-33/&gt;

Hesse was among the first artists of the 1960s to experiment with the fluid contours of the organic world of nature, as well as the simplest of artistic gestures. Some observers see in these qualities latent, proto-feminist references to the female body; others find in Hesse's languid forms expressions of wit, whimsy, and a sense of spontaneous invention with casually found, or "everyday" materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-hesse-eva.htm|title=Eva Hesse Biography, Art, and Analysis of Works|work=The Art Story|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent artists that have noted her as a primary influence include Japanese artist [[Eiji Sumi]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/292461/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
In 1961, Hesse's gouache paintings were exhibited in Brooklyn Museum’s 21st International Watercolor Biennial. Simultaneously, she showed her drawings in the John Heller Gallery exhibition Drawings: Three Young Americans.&lt;ref name="Corby12"/&gt; In August 1962, she and Tom Doyle participated in an [[Allan Kaprow]] [[Happening]] at the [[Art Students League of New York]] in [[Woodstock, New York]]. In 1963, Hesse had a one-person show of works on paper at the Allan Stone Gallery on New York's [[Upper East Side]].&lt;ref&gt;Lippard 1992, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Her first solo show of sculpture was presented at the Kunstverein für die Rheinlande und Westfalen, Düsseldorf, in 1965.&lt;ref name="Eva Hesse"/&gt; In November 1968, she exhibited her large-scale sculptures at the [[Fischbach Gallery]] in New York. The exhibition was titled ''Chain Polymers'' and was her only solo sculpture exhibition during her lifetime in the United States.&lt;ref name="Sussman and Wasserman, Preface"&gt;Sussman and Wasserman, Preface&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was pivotal in Hesse's career, securing her reputation at the time.&lt;ref name="Sussman and Wasserman, Preface"/&gt; Her large piece ''Expanded Expansion'' showed at the [[Whitney Museum]] in the 1969 exhibit "Anti-Illusion: Process/Materials".&lt;ref name=Danto-30&gt;Danto, 2006, p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been dozens of major posthumous exhibitions in the United States and Europe. An early one was at The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] (1972),&lt;ref&gt;Lippard 1992, pp. 5, 128–29, 138, 180-82.&lt;/ref&gt; while In 1979, three separate iterations of an Eva Hesse retrospective were held, entitled ''Eva Hesse: Sculpture''. These exhibitions took place at the [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]] in London from May 4-June 17, 1979; the [[Kröller-Müller Museum|Kroller-Muller]] in [[Otterlo]] from June 30-August 5, 1979; and the Kestner-Gesellschaft in [[Hannover]] from August 17-September 23, 1979. One artwork featured in the exhibition was ''Aught,'' four double sheets of latex stuffed with polyethylene.&lt;ref&gt;[Artforum, Summer 1979. Page 6]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1992 and 1993, retrospective exhibitions were held in New Haven, Valencia and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://museum-wiesbaden.de/en/eva-hesse|title=Eva Hesse - Museum Wiesbaden|website=museum-wiesbaden.de|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st-century, there have been exhibitions in 2002 (organised jointly between the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]], [[Tate Modern]] and [[Museum Wiesbaden]] &lt;ref name="SFMOMA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/eva-hesse|title=Eva Hesse – Exhibition at Tate Modern {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Drawing Center]] in New York (2006) and the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum of New York]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thejewishmuseum.org/exhibitions/eva-hesse-sculpture|title=Eva Hesse: Sculpture|website=The Jewish Museum|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2006).&lt;ref name="Danto-30" /&gt; In Europe, Hesse had a posthumous exhibition in 2010 at the [[Fundació Antoni Tàpies]] in Barcelona. Hesse had an exhibit from August to October 2009 at the Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eva Hesse Studio|last=Fer|first=Briony|publisher=The Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-300-13476-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Burkina Faso|Constitution]] of [[Burkina Faso]] provides for [[freedom of religion]], and the Government generally respects this right in practice. Government policy contributes to the generally free practice of religion. There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice; however, at times community members forced old women falsely accused of being [[witches]] to flee their villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Freedom of Religion Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2009/127219.htm|website=US Department of State|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious demography==
{{main|Religion in Burkina Faso}}
While exact statistics on religious affiliation are not available and vary widely, the Government estimated in its most recent census (1996) that approximately 60 percent of the population practice [[Islam]], and that the majority of this group belong to the [[Sunni]] branch. The Government also estimated that 24 percent of the population maintains [[traditional indigenous beliefs]], 17 percent practices [[Roman Catholicism]], and 3 percent are members of various [[Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]]. Statistics on religious affiliation are approximate because incorporating traditional indigenous beliefs and practices is widespread among both Christians and Muslims.

Muslims reside largely around the northern, eastern, and western borders, while Christians live in the center of the country. People practice traditional indigenous religious beliefs throughout the country, especially in rural communities. Most [[ethnic groups]] are religiously [[heterogeneous]], although the [[Fulani]] and [[Dyula people|Dioula]] communities are overwhelmingly Muslim.

==Status of religious freedom==

===Legal and policy framework===
Article 31 of the Constitution states that "Burkina Faso is a democratic, unitary and secular State".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burkina Faso|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Burkina_Faso_2012.pdf?lang=en|website=Constitute Project|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice. The Government at all levels sought to protect this right in full and did not tolerate its abuse, either by governmental or private actors.

The Constitution and laws protect the right of individuals to choose and change their religion and provide the right to practice the religion of one's choice. The Government observes and enforces these provisions. The country is a [[secular state]]. Islam, Christianity, and traditional indigenous religious beliefs were practiced freely without government interference. There is no official state religion, and the Government neither subsidized nor favored any particular religion. The practice of a particular religion was not known to confer any advantage or disadvantage in the political arena, the civil service, the military, or the private sector.

The Government establishes the following religious holy days as national holidays: [[Eid al-Adha]], [[Easter Monday]], [[Ascension Day]], the [[Muhammad's birthday|Birth of the Prophet Muhammad]], [[Assumption Day]], [[All Saints' Day]], [[Ramadan]], and [[Christmas Day]].

The Government requires all organizations, religious or otherwise, to register with the [[Ministry of Territorial Administration]]. Registration confers legal status, but it entails no specific controls or benefits. According to article 45 of the [[Freedom of Association Code]], failure to register may result in a fine of approximately $97 to $292 (50,000 CFA to 150,000 [[CFA franc|CFA]]). The Government gives all religious groups equal access to registration and routinely approves their applications. The Government taxes religious groups only if they engage in commercial activities, such as farming and dairy production.

The Constitution provides freedom of expression in publications and broadcasts, including those by religious groups, unless the judicial system determines that such expression is harming public order or committing slander; the judicial system has never made such a determination. The Government did not deny a publishing or broadcasting license to any religious group that requested one during the period covered by this report.

Religious organizations operate under the same regulatory framework for publishing and broadcasting rights as other entities. The Ministry of Security has the right to request samples of proposed publications and broadcasts to verify that they are in accordance with the stated nature of the religious group; however, there were no reports that religious broadcasters experienced difficulties with this regulation. Additionally, the Government does not grant special tax preferences to religious organizations operating print or broadcast media.

Foreign [[missionary]] groups operate freely and face few, if any, restrictions; however, missionary groups occasionally faced complicated bureaucratic procedures in pursuit of particular activities.

[[State school|Public school]]s do not offer [[religious instruction]]. Muslim, Catholic, and Protestant groups operate [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s. Although school officials have to submit the names of their directors to the Government and register their schools, religious or otherwise, the Government does not appoint or approve these officials.

The Government does not fund religious schools or require them to pay taxes unless they conduct for-profit activities. The Government reviews the curriculum of religious schools to ensure that they offer the full standard academic curriculum. The Government, however, does not interfere with the curriculum of supplemental classes offered by [[private schools]], such as classes on the [[Bible]] or the [[Qur'an]].

The government taxes religious groups only if they engage in commercial activities, such as farming or dairy production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jonathan|first1=Fox|title=A World Survey of Religion and the State|page=173-174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
Government policy and practice contributed to the generally free practice of religion.

There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.

===Forced religious conversion===
There were no reports of [[forced religious conversion]], including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.

===Homosexuality===

Homosexual activity is legal in Burkina Faso, and the country has neither passed a law prohibiting such activity nor has ever criminalized it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=State-Sponsored Homophoba |url=http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2013.pdf |website=International Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans and Intersex Association |accessdate=25 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IEmVxpKn?url=http://old.ilga.org/Statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2013.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
There were no reports of [[societal abuses]] or [[religious discrimination|discrimination]] based on religious belief or practice; however, at times community members forced old women falsely accused of being witches to flee their villages. The Catholic Church funded-[[Delwende Center]] that houses and feeds women accused of witchcraft reported seven cases of this kind. The [[Ministry of Social Action and National Solidarity]], along with various other nongovernmental and religious organizations, also maintained similar shelters in [[Ouagadougou]].

Some Muslims considered the 1996 law against [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM) as discriminating against their religious practices and continued performing the procedure. Sometimes non-Muslim FGM practitioners performed the procedure during baptismal ceremonies because the baby was expected to cry during the ceremony.

Unlike in previous reports, there were no reports of tensions within sectors of the Muslim community during the period covered by this report.

[[Image:David Roberts Rock Temple Gerf Hussein.jpg|thumb|Painting of the inside rock-cut temple of Gerf Hussein by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] (1838)]]
The temple of '''Gerf Hussein''' was originally a partly free-standing, and partly rock-cut (i.e. hemispeos) temple of pharaoh [[Ramesses II]], which was built by the Viceroy of Nubia, [[Setau]], at a site some 90&amp;nbsp;km south of Aswan.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Nigel Strudwick &amp; Sabine Gardiner, The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egyptian Architecture, I.B. Tauris Publishers, 2003. p.98&lt;/ref&gt; It was dedicated to "[[Ptah]], Ptah-Tatenen and [[Hathor]], and associated with Ramesses, 'the Great God.'"&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, Blackwell Books, 1992. p.260&lt;/ref&gt; Gerf Hussein was known as Per Ptah or the "House of Ptah."&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, p.260&lt;/ref&gt; An avenue of ram headed sphinxes led from the Nile to the first pylon, which like the courtyard beyond is also free standing.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Strudwick &amp; Gardiner, op. cit., p.99&lt;/ref&gt; The courtyard is surrounded by six columns and eight statue pillars.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Strudwick &amp; Gardiner, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance to a peristyle court "is decorated with colossal Osiris statues."&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, p.260&lt;/ref&gt; The rear portion of the building which is 43 m in depth was carved out of rock and follows the structure of Abu Simbel with a pillared hall featuring two rows of three statue pillars and, curiously, four statue recesses, each with divine triads along the sides.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Strudwick &amp; Gardiner, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beyond the hall lay the hall of the offering table and the barque chamber with four cult statues of Ptah, Ramesses, Ptah-Tatenen and Hathor carved out of the rock. During the building of the Aswan dam project in the 1960s, sections of the free-standing portion of this temple were dismantled and they have now been reconstructed at the site of [[New Kalabsha]]. Most of the rock cut temple was left in place and is now submerged beneath the waters of the Nile.

'''Gethin Davies''' (18 September 1846 &amp;ndash; 17 March 1896) was a Welsh Baptist minister and college principal.&lt;ref name="WBO"/&gt; He was born in [[Aberdulais]]; his parents were Joseph and Catherine Davies of [[Glamorganshire]]. Gethin attended Havod British school, and served a five year pupil-teacher apprenticeship there. In 1864 he moved to study at Graig House Academy, [[Swansea]], and from there, in 1866, to [[Bristol]] Baptist College.

In 1872 he was appointed to the post of Classical Tutor at [[Llangollen]] Baptist College, and thence devoted himself to the task of assisting the weaker churches, and strengthening the position of the Baptist denomination in North Wales. He was also instrumental in the relocation of the Baptist College from [[Llangollen]] to [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] (effected in 1892).

His written works (as ‘Gethin Dulais’) include contributions of verse to Welsh periodicals, and a number of Welsh hymns.&lt;ref name="WBO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gethin Davies|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-DAVI-GET-1846.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|last=Williams|first=Griffith John|accessdate= 2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[London]] in 1896, aged 49, of [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3103133/3103134/5/davies|title=Dr Gethin Davies, Bangor|journal=The London Kelt|date=21 March 1896|access-date=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib''' is one of the nine historical [[Gurdwara]]s in [[Delhi]]. It was first constructed in 1783 by [[Baghel Singh]] to commemorate the martyrdom site of the ninth [[Sikh Guru]], Guru [[Tegh Bahadur]]. situated in [[Chandni Chowk]] in [[Old Delhi]], it marks the site where the ninth Sikh Guru was beheaded on the orders of the [[Mughal emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]] on 11 November 1675 for refusing to convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guru Tegh Bahadur: background and the supreme sacrifice|author=Gurbachan Singh Talib (Ed.)|publisher=Punjabi University |year=1976|isbn= |page= |url= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyc/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Sisganj GUrudwara in Old Delhi.jpg4.jpg|thumb|Front view of the Gurudwara]]
The ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur was beheaded here on 11 November 1675 on the orders of Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] when Guru Tegh Bahadur protested against the forceful conversion of Kashmiri Pandits and non-Muslims to Islam. However, before his body could be quartered and exposed to public view, it was stolen under the cover of darkness by one of his disciples, Lakhi Shah Vanjara who, then burnt his house to cremate Guru's body; today, at this site stands [[Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.happytrips.com/destinations/guru-tegh-bahadur-martyrdom-day-2017-visit-this-gurudwara-in-old-delhi/as61778061.cms|title=Guru Tegh Bahadur Martyrdom Day 2017: visit this Gurudwara in old Delhi|last=Sengar|first=Resham|work=HappyTrips|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The trunk of the tree beneath which the head of the Guru was severed and the well used by him for taking bath during his prison term have been preserved in the shrine. Also, adjoining the gurudwara, stands the ''[[Kotwali]]'' (police station), where Guru was imprisoned and his disciples were tortured. Located close to it is the [[Sunehri Masjid (Chandni Chowk)]].

On 11 March 1783, Sikh military leader [[Baghel Singh]] (1730–1802) marched into Delhi along with his army. He occupied the [[Diwan-i-Am (Red Fort)|Diwan-i-Am]], the Mughal emperor [[Shah Alam II]] made a settlement with them agreeing to allow Baghel Singh to raise gurudwaras on Sikh historical sites in the city and receive six annas in a rupee (37.5%) of all the octroi duties in the capital. Sis Ganj was one of the shrines built by him, within the time span of eight months, from April to November 1783. However, due to volatile political climate in the coming century, the site alternated between being a mosque and a gurudwara. It became a site of dispute between two communities, and litigation followed. Eventually after prolonged ligation the Privy Council during [[British Raj]] ruled in the favour of the Sikh litigants and the present structure was added in 1930; gold gild of the domes was added in the coming years. The ''Kotwali'' was handed over to the [[Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee]] around 2000.&lt;ref name=encyc&gt;{{cite book |title=The encyclopedia of Sikhism|author=H. S Singha|publisher=Hemkunt Press |year=2000|isbn=81-7010-301-0 |page=187 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gqIbJz7vMn0C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=Gurudwara+Shish+Ganj#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ss&gt;{{cite book |title=Sikh Studies, Book 7|author=H.S.

The severed head ("Sis" in Hindi or Punjabi) of Guru Tegh Bahadur was brought to [[Anandpur Sahib]] by Bhai Jaita, another disciple of the Guru.&lt;ref name="encyc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ss" /&gt; Another gurudwara by the same name, Gurudwara Sisganj Sahib at [[Anandpur Sahib]] in Punjab, marks this site, where, in November 1675, the head of the martyred Guru Teg Bahadur, brought by Bhai Jaita (renamed Bhai Jivan Singh according to [[Sikh rites]]), in defiance of the Mughal authorities, was cremated.

'''Herman Leonard''' (March 6, 1923, in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agallery.com/Pages/photographers/leonard.html – "Herman Leonard Bio" ''A Gallery for Fine Photography''] August 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– August 14, 2010, in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]) was an American photographer known for his unique images of [[jazz]] icons.

==Life==
Leonard's parents, Joseph Leonard and Rose Morrison, were Romanian Jewish immigrants who emigrated from [[Iaşi]] to the United States.&lt;ref name="bookref1"&gt;{{cite book|last=David Houston|title=Jazz, Giants and Journeys: The Photography of Herman Leonard|publisher= Scala Publishers|date=October 2006|page = 234|isbn=1-85759-434-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/01/herman-leonard-jazz-201001 Herman Leonard’s Eye for Jazz]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard gained a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] degree in photography in 1947 from [[Ohio University]], although his college career was interrupted by a tour of duty in the U.S. Army during World War II.  In the military he served as a medical technician in [[Burma]], while attached to [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s Chinese troops [[Second Sino-Japanese War|fighting the Japanese]].

After graduation, he apprenticed with portraitist [[Yousuf Karsh]] for one year. Karsh gave him valuable experience photographing public personalities such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Harry Truman]] and [[Martha Graham]].

In 1948, Leonard opened his first studio in New York's [[Greenwich Village]] at 200 Sullivan St. Working free-lance for various magazines, he spent his evenings at the [[Royal Roost]] and then [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]], where he photographed jazz musicians such as [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Miles Davis]] and others. The number of shots possible at a time was limited. Using glass negatives at this time, Leonard increased the sensitivity of the plates by exposing them to mercury vapor.

After working for jazz record producer [[Norman Granz]], who used his work on album jackets, Leonard was employed in 1956 by [[Marlon Brando]] as his personal photographer to document an extensive research trip in the [[Far East]]. Following his return, Leonard moved to Paris, photographing assignments in the fashion and advertising business and as European correspondent for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine. He also photographed many French recording artists for Barclay Records, including Dalida, Charles Aznavour, Léo Ferré, Henri Salvador, Jacques Brel, Jean Ferrat, Les Chaussettes Noires, Eddy Mitchell, and Johnny Hallyday.

In 1980, Leonard, with his wife Elisabeth and two children, Shana and David, moved from Paris to the island of [[Ibiza]], where he remained until 1988, when he relocated to London with his children. It was here that Leonard had his first exhibition of his work at the Special Photographers Company in [[Notting Hill]]. The exhibition was visited by over ten thousand people, including singers [[Sade Adu|Sade]] and [[Bono]] of [[U2]]. The show toured the United States in 1989, and Leonard briefly moved to San Francisco. After an exhibition at A Gallery for Fine Photography in New Orleans, he fell in love with the city and made it his home for the next fourteen years, immersing himself in the city's lively jazz and [[blues]] scene.

In August 2005, [[Hurricane Katrina]] heavily damaged Leonard's home studio when the 17th Canal Levee broke near his home. The photographer and his family lost much property, including 8,000 prints, but his negatives were protected in the vault of the Ogden Museum in New Orleans.&lt;ref name="KATRINA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-060628reich-story1-story.html |title=Thousands of famed photos ruined |newspaper=Chicagotribune.com |date=September 12, 2005 |first=Howard |last=Reich|accessdate= April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Hurricane Katrina, Leonard moved to [[Studio City]], California, and re-established his business there, working with music and film companies and magazines. During this time, he received a grant from the GRAMMY Foundation, that allowed for his vast library of photographic negatives to be digitally archived for future generations.

Leonard's jazz photographs, now valuable collector's items, are a unique record of the jazz scene of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, and his collection is now in the permanent archives of American Musical History in the [[Smithsonian Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 2008, long-time friend [[Tony Bennett]] presented Leonard with the coveted Lucie Award at a ceremony at [[Lincoln Center]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Lucies.org 2015-04-04"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lucies.org/honorees/herman-leonard/ |title=The Lucie Awards - Herman Leonard, 2008 Honoree: Achievement in Portraiture |newspaper=Lucies.org |accessdate=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Leonard was the commencement speaker for the 2009 graduating class of Ohio University, at which time he also received an honorary doctorate.

He worked with musician [[Lenny Kravitz]] on a project in the [[Bahamas]] during January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/7950757/Herman-Leonard.html Obituary: Herman Leonard], ''Daily Telegraph'', August 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louisiana Public Broadcasting]], under president [[Beth Courtney]], produced the documentary ''Frame after Frame: The Images of Herman Leonard''.

The BBC produced a film, (2011) "Saving Jazz", about Herman Leonard's struggles following the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans.  The film was directed by documentary filmmaker Leslie Woodhead.

In 2012, the '''GRAMMY Museum''' in Los Angeles, CA presented a year-long retrospective,  '''Herman Leonard: Documenting the Giants of Jazz'''.

In 2013, '''The William J. Clinton Presidential Library''' in Little Rock, AR honored Herman Leonard's work with a major five-month exhibition, ''''''Jazz: Through the Eyes of Herman Leonard''''''.  The exhibition also included artifacts from many of the artists that Leonard photographed, including Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Chet Baker and Ella Fitzgerald. President Clinton has said that "Herman Leonard is the greatest jazz photographer in the history of the genre." A keynote address was given by Leonard's daughter Shana Leonard and Stephen Smith.

{{Hinduism by country}}

In Denmark there are about 7,500-8,000 [[Hindus]] of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] Origin.

Hindu and Sikh Community in Denmark are Registered as reported in [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71377.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2006, Denmark]. Also reported is the Krishna devotees. However, since Krishna is part of Hinduism, it need not be mentioned separately.

==Arrival of first Hindus of Sri Lankan Tamil origin==
The first Hindus of Sri Lankan Tamil origin came in 1983 because of the escalating conflict in Sri Lanka. It was mostly men, and they were categorized as de facto refugees. Today they have married or have got the family, they had to leave to Denmark, and around half of the Tamils have been granted Danish citizenship.

Hindus of Sri Lankan Tamil origin have realized that there will not be any solution to the conflict in Sri Lanka in the near future, and they have begun to rebuild or reorganize some of their cultural and religious representations in Denmark, so they can cope with the requirements of the traditions and Danish society as well. For example, this creates an institutionalized Hinduism, where the temple has become the religious bearer per se (internal representation), and that the bharata-natyam that has its roots in the Ancient Tamil Nadu in Tanjore, has become very popular among all the Tamils (external representation), because it communicates very well with Danish society. Of course, whether Danes know what the term "bhakthi" means is altogether a different story.

In Denmark there are two consecrated Hindu temples: one dedicated to [[Vinayakar]] or the [[Ganesha]] and the other to the Goddess [[Abirami]] apart from the ISKCON temples.

== Indians in Denmark ==
Out of a population of 5.3 million, the Indian community (PIOs and NRIs) is approximately 5,000. (This Percentage excludes Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus.) Indian Nationals in Denmark are mainly Computer Professionals, Doctors, Kiosk and restaurant owners and students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4165">Hinduism is a minority religion in [[Guadeloupe]], followed by some [[Indo-Guadeloupeans]]. According to a statistics data, Hinduism is practised by 0.5% of the people in Guadeloupe.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.religion-facts.com/en/191&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temples==
There are a sizeable number of Hindu Tamil temples that are located in [[Basse-Terre]], and other regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesilesdeguadeloupe.com/2/5-touristic-offer-detail/1249000248-1249000106-gb-basse-terre/-1-1-1-1-basse-terre.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201025303/http://www.lesilesdeguadeloupe.com/2/5-touristic-offer-detail/1249000248-1249000106-gb-basse-terre/-1-1-1-1-basse-terre.htm |archivedate=2007-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a Hindu temple in dravidian style in Changy in [[Basse-Terre|Basse Terre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.alovelyworld.com/webguadeloupe/htmgb/guadeloupe-hindu-temple-changy.htm|title=Ideas for a trip - Changy|website=mobile.alovelyworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another one in Gaschet in [[Grande-Terre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://placesmap.net/GP/Temple-Hindou-de-Gaschet-578106/|title=Temple Hindou de Gaschet, Grande-Terre, Guadeloupe|website=placesmap.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Although the Indo-Guadeloupeans constitute about 14% of the Guadeloupe,&lt;ref name="newsgram"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsgram.com/indian-diaspora-in-guadeloupe/amp/|title=Indian diaspora in Guadeloupe|website=NewsGram|accessdate=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; only some of them are still Hindus. Most of the Indo-Guadelopeans are Catholics, but they also worship Hindu gods. [[Ernest Moutoussamy]], first Indo-Guadelopean member of the French Parliament said in an interview that "Though we are Catholics, we still have images of Hindu gods at home. We celebrate all the Christian festivals but we don’t celebrate Deepavali.""&lt;ref name="moutoussamy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moutoussamy.net/article.php3?id_article=30|website=moutoussamy.net|title=Ernest MOUTOUSSAMY en Inde|accessdate=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==
Revival of Hinduism happened in the last few decades. Many associations for the promotion of Hinduism and Indian culture have appeared during the 90's. The Institut du Monde Indien (Institute for the study of the Indian world) was begun by Jacques Sidambarom, Jean-Claude Petapermal and Roland Gopy to resuscitate Hindu rituals and connect Hindus in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Réunion|Reunion]], [[Pondicherry]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4700|title=Hinduism Today Magazine|first=Himalayan|last=Academy|website=www.hinduismtoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temples were also constructed as a part of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hinduismtoday.com/blogs-news/hindu-press-international/new-hindu-temple-in-guadeloupe-opens-in-the-traditional-way-/7262.html|title=Hinduism Today Magazine|first=Himalayan|last=Academy|website=www.hinduismtoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu religious rituals were also reactivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.everyculture.com/Ge-It/Guadeloupe.html|title=Culture of Guadeloupe - history, people, clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family, social|website=www.everyculture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu festivals like [[Diwali]]&lt;ref name="hinduismtoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4700|author=Himalayan Academy|title=Guadeloupe Lights Up - Magazine Web Edition February 1998 - Publications - Hinduism Today Magazine|website=hinduismtoday.com|accessdate=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pongal]]&lt;ref name="caraibcreolenews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caraibcreolenews.com/index.php/service-presse/item/1206-guadeloupe-3eme-celebration-du-pongal-en-guadeloupe|title=Guadeloupe. 3ème célébration du Pongal en Guadeloupe - CCN - Caraib Creole News / L'actualité de Guadeloupe, Martinique et de la Caraïbe|website=caraibcreolenews.com|accessdate=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also started celebrating.

'''Idy''' was an important [[Ancient Egypt]]ian official in the [[Eighth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighth Dynasty]], at the beginning of the [[First Intermediate Period]]. He was the son of [[Shemay]] who is also known from several monuments and decrees from [[Koptos]]. His mother was the ''king's daughter'' Nebet. Idy appears on [[Coptos Decrees|many royal decrees found at Koptos]]. There he bears the important title of a [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|vizier]], but was also overseer of Upper Egypt and ''overseer of priest'' and ''[[Haty-a|count]]''. The decrees are dated under king [[Neferkauhor]] and [[Neferirkare]]. One decree (called today Koptos M) is addressed to Shemay and dates under Neferkauhor. It reports the appointment of Idy to the ''[[overseer of Upper Egypt]]''.{{sfn|Goedicke|1967|pp=185-189}} A second one (Koptos Q) mentions affairs in the temple of [[Min (deity)|Min]] at Koptos.{{sfn|Goedicke|1967|pp=190-192}} In a third decree (Koptos R) Idy bears the titles of a vizier. In the decree, the king protects the statues and the funerary cult of Idy. The decree is dated under king Neferirkare, who was the successor of Neferkauhor.{{sfn|Goedicke|1967|p=225}} It seems that Idy took over many positions that his father hold before.{{sfn|Hayes|1946|p=20}}

Idy is also known from inscriptions in the tomb of his father Shemay. One inscription reports that Idy found the chapel of his father in ruins and rebuilt it.{{sfn|Mostafa|2014|pp=117-133, pl. XIVa}} A second inscription reports that king Pepy Neferirkare (the latter name is partly destroyed), was sending someone to bring for him a [[sarcophagus]] and stones for the father's tomb. The name of Idy is not preserved, but can be reconstructed.{{sfn|Mostafa|2014|pp=155-175}} The shipping of the sarcophagus is also depicted on one wall in Shemay's tomb. Here is also mentioned the local official and ''eldest king's son'' [[User (ancient Egyptian official)|User]].{{sfn|Mostafa|2014|pp=141-151}}

There is also a statue in [[Brussels]] (no. E.4355) that might belong to Idy. Here he bears the titles ''god's father, beloved of the god'' and ''hereditary prince'' ([[iry-pat]]).{{sfn|Mostafa|2014|p=34, pl. XIII}} There is also a rock inscription from the [[Wadi Hammamat]] that most likely belongs to this Idy. Here he bears the titles ''royal sealer'', ''sole friend'', ''controller of priests'', ''privy to the secret of the god's treasure''. The inscription also mentions the ''overseer of Upper Egypt'' Tjauti-iqer and reports the bringing of stones.{{sfn|Mostafa|2014|p=34, pl. XIVa}}

'''''Light in My Darkness''''' is a book, originally published in 1927 as '''''My Religion''''', written by [[Helen Keller]] when she was 47 years old. The book was written as a tribute to [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] whom Helen regarded as "one of the noblest champions true Christianity has ever known". This book is regarded as Keller's [[spiritual autobiography]] in which she openly declares that "the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg have been my light, and a staff in my hand and by his vision splendid I am attended on my way".

The original publication was loosely put together and hastily printed by [[Doubleday, Page &amp; Company]]. Nevertheless, it sold well in 1927 and has remained in print ever since. In 1994, Ray Silverman, a [[Swedenborgianism|Swedenborgian]] minister and literary scholar, thoroughly revised and edited ''My Religion,'' organizing the eight unwieldy sections of the first edition into twelve distinct chapters with subheadings to clarify their contents. Furthermore, important materials not present in the first edition were added to elucidate and expand the original text. Other revisions included modernization of several words and phrases, substitution of inclusive language where appropriate, correction of spelling and typographical errors, alteration of punctuation to conform to modern standards, and emendation of a few historical inaccuracies. Extra paragraph breaks were added and a very few passages that distracted from the main messages were delicately pruned. It should be emphasized, however, that these revisions were negligible next to all that was retained.

In 2000 a second edition of ''Light in My Darkness'' was published which included an article that was originally published in ''[[Guideposts (magazine)|Guideposts]]'' magazine in 1956, when Keller was 76 years old. The article, which was reprinted by Guideposts in 1995, is significant in that it establishes the fact that Keller was indeed a lifelong Swedenborgian. It is in this article that she writes,
{{quote|Since my seventeenth year, I have tried to live according to the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg. By "church" he did not mean an ecclesiastical organization, but a spiritual fellowship of thoughtful men and women who spend their lives for a service to mankind that outlasts them. He called it a civilization that was to be born of a healthy, universal religion—goodwill, mutual understanding, service from each to all, regardless of dogma or ritual.}}

Also included in the 2000 edition is a quote from Keller's last published book, ''[[Teacher (book)|Teacher]]'' (1955). In it she speaks of her undimmed enthusiasm for Swedenborg's teachings. She does this by first quoting the American poet, Walt Whitman who wrote: 
"O Spirit, as a runner strips/ Upon a windy afternoon/ Be unencumbered of what troubles you--/ Arise with grace / And greatly go, with the wind upon your face."

Keller then adds, "In that state of exhilaration I had accepted the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, had drunk in his interpretation of the [[Bible]], fearless, reverent, yet as unconfined as the sun, the clouds, the sea."

The change in title from ''My Religion'' to ''Light in My Darkness'' is significant. The new title is taken from one of Keller's poetic statements in which she declares, "I know that life is given us so that we may grow in love. And I believe that God is in me as the sun is in the color and fragrance of the flower, the Light in my darkness, the Voice in my silence."

== Reception ==
Readers were divided by those impressed by her faith and those disappointed that the famous [[deafblind]] activist advocated Swedenborgianism rather than a more "mainstream" religion.

[[File:Brooklyn Museum 75.147.1 Divination Tray Opon Ifa.jpg|thumb|150x150px|An early 20th Century Opon Ifá divination tray, from the collection of the [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
An '''Opon Ifá''' (known as '''La Mesa de Ifá''' in [[Latin America]]) is a divination tray used in [[Traditional African religion|traditional African]] and [[Afro-American religions]], notably in [[Ifá]] and [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba tradition]].&lt;ref name="Bascom1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=William W. Bascom|title=Ifa Divination: Communication between Gods and Men in West Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CS0h4Ye9puUC&amp;pg=PA33|date=22 March 1991|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-11465-5|pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Babalawo]] (diviner) uses the Opon Ifá in order to communicate with the spirits who are able to identify the causes and solutions to personal and collective problems and restore harmony with the spirits.&lt;ref name= sjsu/&gt; Opon Ifás are flat and usually circular, between about 6 and 18 inches in diameter, with a raised outer edge carved with figures, objects, or geometric designs.&lt;ref name="Bascom1991"/&gt; Opon Ifás may also be rectangular, semi-circular, or an approximate square.&lt;ref name="Bascom1991"/&gt; The top of the tray is called the head, and the bottom, the foot - the latter is typically placed closest to the diviner. At the head is generally carved with a representation of [[Eshu]], the messenger of Ifá and the other spirits.&lt;ref name="Bascom1991"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Werness2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hope B.

[[File:Opon ifa retangular, Orossi.JPG|thumb|136x136px|Rectangular Opon Ifá tray]]
On the Opon Ifá, the Babalawo throws sixteen palm or kola nuts onto the flat wooden surface, and determines which eight of the 256 possible sets of Odus (signs) are displayed. The signs have correlating verses which must be chanted, and chosen according to the client's particular situation.&lt;ref name= sjsu&gt;{{cite web |url= http://csuimages.sjsu.edu/gallery/exhibits/african/africaexhibit/imageswitharrows/squareopon.html |title=Opon (Ifa Divination Board) |work=csuimages.sjsu.edu |year=2004 |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Werness2003"/&gt; In many traditions, a divination chain known as ''Opele'' has replaced the palm or kola nuts, which are reserved for more serious questions.&lt;ref name="Werness2003"/&gt;

'''Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association''' (OREA) is a [[Pentecostal]] ministry started by [[faith healer]] and [[televangelist]] [[Oral Roberts]] and currently run by his son [[Richard Roberts (evangelist)|Richard Roberts]].

Originally operating as a traveling revival with claims of curing the sick, in 1963 [[Oral Roberts University]] was founded by the ministry. In 2007 following a lawsuit involving Roberts, the school and the association's finances were separated.&lt;ref&gt;AP, Justin Juozapavicius, ''[http://apnews.myway.com/article/20071129/D8T75O201.html Roberts Says God Forced His Resignation]'', 29 November 2007, retrieved 29 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to Oral Roberts, his ministry began when God spoke to him and he was healed of both tuberculosis and stuttering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oralroberts.com/oralroberts/biography/1930-1939/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, he conducted his first healing service in downtown Enid, Oklahoma where Oral’s healing ministry was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oralroberts.com/oralroberts/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623041011/http://www.oralroberts.com/oralroberts/ |archivedate=2011-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he began to hold tent meetings. During the 1950s, Oral expanded his ministry through literature that was printed and distributed to people around the world, and through the launching of his television ministry.

He founded the Abundant Life Prayer Group in 1958 and soon phone calls for prayer were coming in from people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralroberts.com/oralroberts/biography/1950-1959/ 1950-1959 – The Legacy of Oral Roberts]&lt;/ref&gt; And in 1962, Oral broke ground for the [[Oral Roberts University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oralroberts.com/oralroberts/biography/1960-1969/ 1960-1969 'The Legacy of Oral Roberts']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Oral’s son, [[Richard Roberts (evangelist)|Richard Roberts]], began his own healing ministry and became President of Oral Roberts Ministries.  Richard currently holds healing rallies in the United States and nations  around the world. Richard also hosts a nightly television program ''The Place for Miracles'' and Richard’s wife Lindsay hosts a daily half-hour program ''Make Your Day Count''  that ministers especially to the needs of women.

In Burmese, ordination halls are called '''thein''' (သိမ်), derived from the [[Pali]] term ''sīmā'', which means"boundary."

==Background==
Aimé Boucher was a farmer in Beauce, Québec, and a practicing [[Jehovah's Witness]]. In 1946,&lt;ref&gt;R v Boucher, p 305]&lt;/ref&gt; he was arrested while distributing pamphlets entitled "Québec's Burning Hate for God and Christ and Freedom Is the Shame of all Canada." The pamphlets criticized the Québec government suppression of the Witnesses and the courts for doing nothing to prevent it. Boucher was charged for seditious libel - for endeavouring to promote public disorder - under section 133(2) of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]. At trial, the jury found Boucher guilty, which was upheld on appeal.

==Opinion of the Court==
In a 5 to 4 decision, the Court held that the mere publishing of critical statements, without any intention to incite violence against the government, could not be seditious libel.

==Early life==

Maskeen was born in 1934 at [[Lakki Marwat]] (now in Pakistan) to father Kartar Singh and mother Ram Kaur.

===Establishments===
He established a meditation centre at his home town of Alwar where a samagam (function) is held every year on the eve of [[Hola Mahalla]] which is attended by many scholars, preachers, Dhadi Jathas, [[Kavishar]]s and learned people of Sikh community.

He started the Vishav Sikh Preacher Organization. This works under [[Akal Takhat]]. Two schools - Guru Nanak Public School and Sri Guru Harkrishan Public School - were also controlled by him. In these schools uniforms and books are provided free to the poor students.

==Honours==
He was given the title of [[Panth Ratan]] for his services to mankind through the message of [[Gurbani]]. He was also given Bhai Gurdas Gold posthumous award, worth rupees one lakh and, posthumously, the Gurmat Vidya Martand award by [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]].

The temple was built at a cost of £40,000 which was considered the costliest temple in kutch during that time. For construction of temple one-half was given by Shah Velji Malu and the other in equal shares by Shah Keshavji Nayak , Shivji Nensi and Osval Vanias of Kothara. It was styled after the Jain temple in [[Ahmedabad]], built by Kutch workmen under the superintendence of Salat Nathu of Sabhrai.&lt;ref name="gbp"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency: Cutch, Palanpur, and Mahi Kantha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLUBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA210|year=1880|publisher=Printed at the Government Central Press|pages=231–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shantinath statue was formally installed by Acharya Ratnasagarsuri of Achal [[Gaccha]]. This temple is also named ‘Kalyan Tunk’ after the writer of the poem ‘Keshavji Nayak’ on the [[Palitana temples]], who was a native of this place. This chief temple is compared to the Meruprabha temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jinalaya.com/gujarat/kothara.htm Kothara Tirth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.panoramio.com/photo/9203428 Shri Kothara Derasar @ the KOTHARA NALIAYA of ABADASA KUTCH.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mistris of Kutch]] are considered main architects of these centuries old beautiful Jain temples .&lt;ref&gt;Nanji Bapa ni Nondh-pothi (1999) by Dharsibhai Jethalal Tank - Vadodara ( Book given ''Kutch Shakti'' award in 2000 at Bombay )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kutch Gurjar Kshatriya Samaj : A brief History &amp; Glory : by Raja Pawan Jethwa, Calcutta.

==Architecture==
[[File:Carving outside Jain Temple.JPG|thumb|Carving on walls]]
There is a high fort with five cells around this temple with 12 feet high and 6 feet broad gate.

Through a very rich two-storied entrance gate, an outer yard surrounded by buildings set apart for the use of priests, opens into a walled quadrangle with a shrine in each wall. In the center of the quadrangle, on a 6 feet 9 inches plinth reached by fifteen steps, is the temple, 78 feet long 69 wide and 73{{1/2}} high, supported on three sides by rich two-storied domed porches. The domed hall, ''[[mandap]]'' rises in two stories, and over the shrine is a spire with richly carved figure niches and moldings.&lt;ref name="gbp"/&gt;

Inside, the hall, ''mandap'', surrounded by aisles or verandahs, with a richly designed pavement of different coloured marbles, has 22 pilasters, and 16 pillars, and a ''dome'' supported on 8 pillars with foiled arches and struts. Inside of a wall, chiefly formed of 20 pillars richly carved with flowers, leaves and creepers is the shrine where, supported on either side by seven small figures, is a large image of Shantinath in [[Lotus position|padmasana]] posture with a golden crown sitting on a richly carved marble throne. The upper story of the hall, reached by stone steps from the south-west porches, has a corridor with rich shrines each containing a large marble sitting image. Moolnayak of this temple is a 90&amp;nbsp;cm high, white colored idol of Bhagawan Shantinath in the Padmasana posture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jinalaya.com/gujarat/kothara.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Below the hall there is an underground shrine, with about twenty-five large white marble figures with precious stones let into the eyes, chests, and arms. Besides the underground shrine there is a [[bhonyra]] especially prepared against a time of trouble.&lt;ref name="gbp"/&gt;

In [[Hinduism]] '''taṭasthā-śakti''' is the spiritual but marginal energy of God, and living beings, [[Jiva]], [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atmas]] have some relationship to it. Although they are eternal, it is their position as marginal energy - between lower material and higher spiritual energy. In other words, taṭasthā-śakti is between external (material) energy and internal (also eternal spiritual) energy of [[Krishna]] [[Svayam Bhagavan]]. In [[Caitanya Caritamrta]], Madhya, Verse 6.160 are enumerated these three energies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The spiritual potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead also appears in three phases -- internal, marginal and external.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Another verse (Caitanya Caritamrta, Madhya, 8.152) gives more information:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In other words, these are all potencies of God -- internal, external and marginal. But the internal potency is the Lord's personal energy and stands over the other two.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So jivatma, living being is never equal to Supreme Godhead and also always subordinate to Him. Over tatastha shakti stands Internal energy of Krishna.

'''Thomas Allen''' or '''Allyn''' (1608 in [[Norwich]] – 21 September 1673) was an [[East Anglia]]n nonconformist minister and [[Anglicanism#Anglican divines|divine]] who preached during the 1640s in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]], but returned to England during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] and was ejected after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Calamy, ed. S. Palmer, ''The Nonconformist's Memorial'', 2nd Edition, 3 vols (Button and Son and T. Hurst, London 1803), III, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=McTvkz4LpS8C&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 11-12] (Google).&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of various published works.&lt;ref&gt;M.R. Bell, 'Allen, Thomas (1608-1673), clergyman and ejected minister', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Allen was the son of John Allen, a Norwich [[Dyer (occupation)|dyer]]. He was educated in Norwich and at [[Caius College, Cambridge]], where he matriculated in 1625 and was scholar 1625-29, taking B.A. in 1627/28 and M.A. in 1631. Having received license and holy orders at Norwich in March 1633/34, he became minister&lt;ref&gt;Not rector: Clergy of the Church of England database shows Edmund Wythe installed as rector in 1633, CCEd [http://db.theclergydatabase.org.uk/jsp/DisplayAppointment.jsp?CDBAppRedID=229083 Appointment Record ID: 229083].&lt;/ref&gt; of the parish church of [[St Edmund's Church, Norwich|St. Edmund's at Norwich]], 1633-38.&lt;ref&gt;Venn, ''Alumni Cantabrigienses'' Part I vol. 1 (Cambridge University Press, 1922), [https://archive.org/details/alumnicantabrigipt1vol1univiala/page/18 p. 19] (Internet Archive].&lt;/ref&gt; But he was too pronouncedly evangelical and outspoken. Bishop [[Matthew Wren]] silenced him in 1636, together with [[William Bridge]] and others, for refusing to read ''[[The Book of Sports]]''.

===To New England===
In 1638&lt;ref&gt;For chronology, see S. Sewall, 'Congregational Churches and Ministers in Middlesex County, Ms.: Appendix (continued)', in ''The American Quarterly Register'' XIII (August 1840), pp. 37-57, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sJo-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false at p. 44] (Google).&lt;/ref&gt; Allen passed over as a fugitive to [[New England]]. Admitted to the church of [[History of Boston#Colonial era|Boston]] on 11 January 1638/39, on 9 June following, at his own request and that of the church of [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]], he was dismissed from Boston, and was admitted to Charlestown on 22 December 1639 (O.S.). Then, or soon afterwards, he became Teacher, as the fellow-worker of [[Zechariah Symmes]], pastor of Charlestown.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Vinton, ''The Symmes Memorial: A Biographical Sketch of Rev. Zechariah Symmes'' (David Clapp &amp; Son, Boston 1873), pp. 1-17, [https://archive.org/details/symmesmemorialbi00vint/page/4 at p. 5].&lt;/ref&gt; In this capacity he succeeded [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]], who had died in September 1638 little more than a year after arriving in Charlestown. He is supposed to have married Harvard's widow, Anna, for he acted as administrator in the execution of Harvard's estate and paid his bequests. His recorded children were Mary (1639/40), Sarah (1641), Elizabeth (1643) and Mercy (1646), of whom only Mary survived infancy, and a son, Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;J. Savage, ''A Genealogical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England'', 4 Vols. (Little, Brown &amp; Co., Boston 1860), I, [https://archive.org/details/agenealogicaldi00unkngoog/page/n56 pp. 36-37] (Internet Archive).&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 May 1639 Allen received the large grant of 500 acres of land from the General Court, "in regard to Mr. Harvard's gift".&lt;ref&gt;R. Frothingham, ''The History of Charlestown, Massachusetts'' (Charles C. Little &amp; James Brown, Boston 1845), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8bNIAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 75, note 4] (Internet Archive).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cotton Mather]] observed that he "approved himself a pious and painful minister of the Gospel at Charlestown", where he remained Teacher until 1651. In his first years in New England he witnessed the foundation of the town of [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]]. The texts of his sermons, not least his series upon the words of St [[John the Baptist]] in the closing verses of [[Gospel of John|St John's Gospel]], chapter 3, concern the doctrine of Justification by Faith. During this time also he conceived and developed his best-known work, ''A Chaine of Scripture Chronologie'', which constructed a chronology of the history of the world, in seven periods down to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ in 3968 [[Anno Mundi]].&lt;ref&gt;P.W. Jackson, ''The Chronologers' Quest: Episodes in the Search for the Age of the Earth'' (Cambridge University Press 2006), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5srq8mdK7bsC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 18] (Google).&lt;/ref&gt; Although not published until 1659 in London, the ''Epistle'' to Allen's book by [[William Greenhill]] (as quoted by Cotton Mather) states: "This work having had its conception in a remote corner of the world, it was latent in his closet, the greatest part of seven years... and it had still been suppressed, had not the author been pressed, and charged with hiding of a talent in a napkin, by... [Mr. John Cotton]." ([[John Cotton (puritan)|John Cotton]] died in 1652&lt;ref&gt;It is unclear whether the identification of Mr Allen's ''Jehoiadah'' as John Cotton is in Greenhill's words or Mather's.&lt;/ref&gt;). Greenhill remarks that its author, wearied with controversy, was glad to leave others to "dispute" while he should "compute": like {{Interlanguage link multi|Abraham Buchholzer|de}} (he says with a flourish), ''malle se computare quam disputare''.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted ''in extenso'' in C. Mather, 'The Life of Mr Thomas Allen', in ''Magnalia Christi Americana: Or, The Ecclesiastical History of New England'' (Book III Chapter II), First American Edition, 2 Vols (Silas Andrus, Boston 1820), I, [https://books.google.dj/books?id=nOpHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA537#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 537-38] (Google).&lt;/ref&gt; By his own introduction Allen acknowledged that he owed much to other scholars, but declined to share their names with his readers.&lt;ref&gt;'Cracking the foundations: Biblical criticism and the Newtonian synthesis', in D.S. Katz,''God's Last Words: Reading the English Bible from the Reformation to Fundamentalism'' (Yale University Press, New Haven and London 2004), pp. 74-115,  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8ZY9gIZ59iUC&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false at pp. 78-79] (Google).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a copy preserved in the New England Library ([[Thomas Prince]] Collection, [[Boston Public Library]]) has the names of the authorities from whom he quoted written in his own hand.&lt;ref&gt;W. Allen, ''An American Biographical and Historical Dictionary'', 2nd Edition (William Hyde &amp; Co., Boston 1832), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9J9WAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 19] (Google).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Old England===
Allen's wife Anne died in or soon after 1651. In that year he returned to Norwich in Old England, where he found a ministry as "preacher of the city" in St. George's parish. (He was not the rector of St. George's, Norwich.) On his return he wrote a letter (dated 8 November 1651 from Norwich) affirming the missionary work of [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] and [[Jonathan Mayhew#Early life|Thomas Mayhew, jnr.]], as they had themselves told him of it, in preaching the gospel among the native Americans. Allen had not had the strength to follow that calling himself.&lt;ref&gt;'Letter of Thomas Allen', in [[Henry Whitfield House#Henry Whitfield|Henry Whitfield]], ''Strength out of Weakness. Or, A Glorious Manifestation of the Further Progresse of the Gospel amongst the Indians in New-England'' (London: Printed by M. Symmons for John Blague and Samuel Howes and are to be sold that their Shop in Popes Head Alley, 1652). Reprint for Joseph Sabin, New York 1865, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435006613269;view=1up;seq=90 pp. 54-57] (Hathi Trust).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In England Allen remarried, to the widow of [[Robert Sedgwick]].&lt;ref&gt;Frothingham, ''The History of Charlestown, Massachusetts'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8bNIAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 133-34, note 2] (Internet Archive).&lt;/ref&gt; He was pastor of the congregational church in Norwich from 1657, but was ejected following the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]]. After this he preached there whenever opportunity arose. John Cromwell succeeded him as pastor, and Cromwell's successor, [[Martin Fynch]], who knew Allen, gave a character of him in his preface dated 1674 to a volume of Allen's sermons. He calls him a "burning and shining light": &lt;blockquote&gt;"he was an excellent preacher, plain and powerful in his doctrine, and though he was a learned man, yet he preached without all ostentation, he did not confound his hearers with obscure terms and fantastical expressions, but endeavoured to set forth the Truths of God in the most plain and convincing way to the consciences of men... Another thing that I would mention of this worthy man was his marvellous condescension in private discourses to his brethren in the ministry, who were much inferiour to him in age and gifts, not standing on his own great worth, never exalting himself, but preferring them above himself, hearing their judgements in any matter with as great reverence and respect as if they had been his superiors. Surely his humility was extraordinary, and a notable example to all that knew him."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Fynch added:&lt;blockquote&gt;"As he was a Scribe instructed to the Kingdom of God in all points of the doctrine of religion, so he was expert in all questions about Church-discipline above many; for which he had been much advantaged by living so long in New-England, and having there such intimate acquaintance with those famous men [[Peter Bulkley|Mr Bulkly]], [[Thomas Hooker|Mr Hooker]], Mr Cotton, [[Thomas Shepard (minister)|Mr Shephard]], and others there, who lived in his heart when they were dead, and he delighted to speak, and to relate some remarkable passages of them."&lt;ref&gt;Fynch, 'To the reader', in ''The Way of the Spirit in Bringing Souls to Christ'' (1676), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qgJnAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 11-16] (Google).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thomas Allen died on 21 September 1673. Fynch published a volume of his sermons in 1676, and a further collection in 1683.

{{Mongolian shamanism}}
In the pantheon of [[Mongolian shamanism]], '''tngri''' (also ''tengri'', ''tegri'') constitute the highest class of divinities and are attested in sources going back to the 13th century. They are led by different chief deities in different documents and are divided into a number of different groups—including black (terrifying) and white (benevolent), and eastern and western. While there generally seem to be 99 ''tngri'', some documents propose three others (from the north), and while they are generally the highest divinities, some liturgical texts propose an additional group of 33 chief gods alongside the ''tngri''. They were invoked only by the highest shamans and leaders for special occasions; they continue to be venerated especially in [[black shamanism]]. Chief among the ''tngri'' are [[Qormusata Tngri]] and (Khan) Möngke Tngri.

The term ''tngri'' is cognate with the Turkic theonym ''[[tengri]]'' "sky", Mongolian ''taŋɣaraɣ'' "oath".&lt;ref&gt;
[[Sergei Starostin]], [http://starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/query.cgi?basename=%5Cdata%5Calt%5Caltet&amp; StarLing database]: 
"Proto-Altaic: *t`aŋgiri "oath, god" (клятва, божество) "An interesting common Altaic religious / juridical term. The proposed etymology presumes that the meaning 'sky' in Turkic is secondary ( &lt; 'God'); if it is not the case, one could accept S. Georg's thesis about a loan in Turkic &lt; Yenisseian *tɨŋgVr- 'high' (see Georg 2001) - although we must admit that other loans from Yenisseian are unknown to us."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mongolian pantheon==
In [[Mongolian shamanism]], ''tngri'' constitute the highest class;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pegg|2001|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are attested already in the oldest written source in Mongolian, ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]''.&lt;ref name=pegg116&gt;{{harvnb|Pegg|2001|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest deity, Tngri, is the "supreme god of heaven" and is derived from [[Tengri]], the primary chief deity in the religion of the early [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Mongols|Mongolic]] peoples, and also goes by Möngke Tngri ("Eternal Heaven") or Erketü Tngri ("Mighty Heaven"); he rules the 99 ''tngri'' as Köke Möngke Tngri ("Blue Eternal Heaven").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heissig|1980|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with him is another chief deity, [[Qormusata Tngri]], described by one scholar as the more active being and compared to the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god of heaven [[Indra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|York|2005|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the 99 ''tngri'', there are also "seventy-seven levels of Mother Earth" and 33 other gods; the latter, like the ''tngri'', are ruled by [[Qormusata Tngri]].&lt;ref name=pegg116/&gt;

===Origin of the ''tngri''===
Some of the ''tngri'' are self-created, a special status, though in later texts some of those ''tngri'' were said to have been created by [[Buddha]], a [[Syncretism|possible influence]] of [[Buddhism]] on Mongolian folk religion. One of those self-created is Khan Möngke Tngri, who created [[Yesu Hei]] (the father of [[Genghis Khan]]) and the Mother of Fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heissig|1980|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''tngri'' and their divisions==
Klaus Hesse described the complex spiritual hierarchy in clan-based Mongolian society based on sources that go back to the 13th century. The highest group in the pantheon consisted of 99 ''tngri'' (55 of them benevolent or "white" and 44 terrifying or "black"), 77 ''natigai'' or "earth-mothers", besides others. The ''tngri'' were called upon only by leaders and great shamans and were common to all the clans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hesse|1987|p=405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black ''tngri'' were invoked only by black shamans "against evil from outside and for securing victory in war".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hesse|1987|p=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To complicate matters, there is a further division among the 99 ''tngri'': 44 are from the "eastern side", 55 from the "western side", and there are three more, from the "northern side", making a total of 102. And among the eastern and western group, there is a division in how the ''tngri'' are supplicated: in both group, the greatest multiple of 10 (40 in the east, 50 in the west) are invoked through prayer, the rest (4 in the east, 5 in the west) through sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heissig|1980|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walther Heissig]] lists a large number of further divisions—the ''tngri'' are made up of groups including the gods of the four corners, five wind gods, five gods of the entrance and five of the door, five of the horizontal, et cetera. He notes that scholars have found a complete enumeration and description of the 99 to be impossible, and that a full list of names mentioned adds up to more than 99, and that local differences occur due to different local gods being accepted and that later sources indicate the further acceptance of Buddhist deities among the ''tngri''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heissig|1980|pp=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of nine supreme ''tngri'' occurs regularly, but they are not always the same though Qormusata Tngri and Möngke Tngri are always included among the "Nine Great Tingri".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heissig|1980|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The ''tngri'' function primarily as protectors. Baγatur Tngri, for instance, is a protector of heroes in warfare, Kisaγa Tngri (an equestrian deity, known as Red Kisant Tngri among the [[Buryati]]) protects riches and the souls of people, and Ataγa Tngri is the protector of horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heissig|1980|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the functions of the ''tngri'' are specifically related to the Mongolian way of existence, especially the herding of cattle; different ''tngri'' have very specialized functions pertaining to specific animals and aspects of their raising. There are also ''tngri'' invoked for hunting and the growing of fruits and grains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heissig|1980|pp=54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''tonalamatl''''' {{IPA-nah|toːnaˈlaːmatɬ|}} is a divinatory [[almanac]] used in central Mexico in the decades, and perhaps centuries, leading up to the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|Spanish conquest]].  The word itself is [[Nahuatl]] in origin, meaning "pages of days".&lt;ref&gt; León-Portilla (1963) 116-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45966622|title=El tiempo en el tonalamatl|last=Elżbieta.|first=Siarkiewicz,|date=1995|publisher=Cátedra de Estudios Ibéricos, Universidad de Varsovia|isbn=9788386483129|oclc=45966622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''tonalamatl'' was structured around the sacred 260-day year, the ''[[tonalpohualli]]''.  This 260-day year consisted of 20 [[trecena]] of 13 days each.  Each page of a ''tonalamatl'' represented one trecena, and was adorned with a painting of that trecena's reigning deity and decorated with the 13 day-signs and 13 other glyphs.  These day-signs and glyphs were used to cast horoscopes and discern the future.  

The best surviving examples of ''tonalamatl'' are the [[Codex Borbonicus]] and the [[Codex Borgia]].

{{further|Wall of Jericho}}

The '''Tower of Jericho''' is an {{convert|8.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} stone structure, built in the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] period around 8000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="BarkaiJP"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/VideoArticles/Video/Article.aspx?id=208206 O'Sullivan, Arieh., World’s first skyscraper sought to intimidate masses, ''Jerusalem Post'', 14 February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; It is among the earliest stone monuments of humanity.&lt;ref name="Parry"&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/12918-tower-jericho-hunter-gatherer-monument.html Parry, Wynne., Tower of Power: Mystery of Ancient Jericho Monument Revealed, LiveScience, 18 February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wall of Jericho]] was discovered by [[John Garstang]] during the excavations of 1930 to 1936, which he suggested were those described in the [[Book of Joshua]] in the [[Bible]] and dated to around 1400 BCE.&lt;ref name="Bromiley1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey W. Bromiley|title=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: A-D|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wo8csizDv0gC&amp;pg=PA275|accessdate=9 July 2011|date=13 February 1995|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=978-0-8028-3781-3|pages=275–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kathleen Kenyon]] discovered the tower built against the wall inside the town during excavations between 1952 and 1958, in trench I. Kenyon provided evidence that both constructions dated much earlier, to the [[Neolithic]], which is the latest part of the [[Stone Age]], and were part of an early [[proto-city]].&lt;ref name="Bromiley1995"/&gt; The tower highlights the importance of [[Jericho]] for the understanding of settlement patterns in the [[Sultanian]] period in the southern [[Levant]].&lt;ref name="Cremin2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aedeen Cremin|title=Archaeologica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0llBlzF6UgC&amp;pg=PA209|accessdate=9 July 2011|date=1 November 2007|publisher=frances lincoln ltd|isbn=978-0-7112-2822-1|pages=209–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The tower was constructed using undressed stones, with an internal staircase of twenty two steps. Conical in shape, the tower is almost {{convert|9|m|ft}} in diameter at the base, decreasing to {{convert|7|m|ft}} at the top with walls approximately {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} thick. The construction of the tower is estimated to have taken 11,000 [[Working time|working days]].

==Purpose==
The Tower has been interpreted as a fortification, an anti-flooding system, a ritual centre and a political symbol of communal power and territorial claim.

Recent studies by Ran Barkai and Roy Liran from [[Tel Aviv University]] have suggested [[astronomical]] and [[social]] purposes in the construction of the tower. Showing an early example of [[archaeoastronomy]], they used [[computer modelling]] to determine that the shadow of nearby mountains first hit the tower on the sunset of the [[summer solstice]] and then spread across the entire town.&lt;ref name="Parry"/&gt; Noting that there were no known invasions of the area at the time of construction, the defensive purpose of the tower, wall and ditch at Jericho has been brought into question. No burials were found and suggestions of it being a tomb have been dismissed.

Discussing in the [[Jerusalem Post]], Barkai argued that the structure was used to create [[awe]] and inspiration to convince people into a harder way of life with the development of [[agriculture]] and social hierarchies. He concluded with, ''"We believe this tower was one of the mechanisms to motivate people to take part in a communal lifestyle."''&lt;ref name="BarkaiJP"/&gt;

{{Mesopotamian myth|expanded=5}}
'''Ugallu''', the "Big Weather-Beast", inscribed U&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/UD.GAL-˹''la''˺,&lt;ref&gt;''Ugallu'', CAD U/W pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: ''ūmu rabû'', meaning "big day", was a lion-headed storm-demon and has the feet of a bird who is featured on protective amulets and apotropaic yellow clay or tamarisk figurines of the first millennium BC but had its origins in the early second millennium. The iconography changed over time, with the human feet morphing into an eagle's talons and dressing him in a short skirt. He was one of the class of ud-demons (day-demons), personifying moments of divine intervention in human life.&lt;ref name=wiggermann&gt;{{ cite book | title = Die Welt Der Götterbilder | chapter = Some Demons of Time and their Functions in Mesopotamian Iconography | author =  F. A. M. Wiggermann | editor = Brigitte Groneberg, Hermann Spieckermann | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 2007 | pages = 108–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==

Ugallu was one of the eleven mythical monsters created by [[Tiamat|Tiāmat]] in her conflict with the younger gods, on the reverse of the first tablet of the Epic of Creation, [[Enûma Eliš]]. The tale describes how [[Marduk]] captured and bound the creatures, rehabilitating them with work reconstructing the world from the corpses of his vanquished adversaries. This transformed them into protective charms which would be used to adorn the doors of palaces, for example that of [[Ashurbanipal]]'s southwest palace at [[Nineveh]], temples, such as the [[Esagil]] of the Marduk temple as described in the [[Agum II#Agum-Kakrime Inscription|Agum-Kakrime Inscription]], and private dwellings (the bedrooms of the vulnerable) to ward off evil and disease. 

Sometimes in pairs of ''ugallū'', the beneficial protective demon finds special purpose in adorning the outer gates of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mesopotamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts | author = F. A. M. Wiggermann | publisher = Styx Publications | year = 1992 | page = 169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wall relief depicting a head of an Uglallu, a lion-headed man..JPG|thumb|Wall relief depicting a head of an Uglallu, a lion-headed man.]]

Ugallu first appears figuratively in the [[Old Babylonian Empire|Old Babylonian period]] as a porter of the underworld, a servant of [[Nergal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = What Is Stronger than a Lion?: Leonine Image and Metaphor in the Hebrew Bible and the Ancient Near East | author = Brent A. Strawn | publisher = Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht | year = 2005 | page = 148 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In later times he is represented on amulets as frequently paired with the Sumerian demon [[Lulal]], who was in many respects fairly similar in appearance. He is portrayed clasping a dagger, and described thus: "a lion's head and lion's ears, it holds a ... in its right hand and carries a mace  (&lt;sup&gt;giš&lt;/sup&gt;TUKUL) in its left, it is girded with a dagger, its name is ugallu."&lt;ref name=wiggermann/&gt;

[[File:Union libérale israélite de France, 24 rue Copernic, Paris 16.jpg|thumb|right|Union Libérale Israélite de France synagogue, [[Paris]]]]
The '''Union Libérale Israélite de France''' ('''ULIF'''), commonly referred to as ''' the rue Copernic synagogue''',  is a [[Reform Judaism|Liberal]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] synagogue, located in [[Paris]], France.  Inaugurated on the first of December 1907, it is the oldest Reform synagogue in France. 

==History==

The synagogue was damaged in a fascist riot in 1941, but was repaired after the war.&lt;ref&gt;''Synagogues of Europe: Architecture, History, Meaning'', Carol Herselle Krinsky, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1985, Dover Publications, 1996, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980 attack===
{{main article|1980 Paris synagogue bombing}}

On October 3, 1980, on the eve of [[Simchat Torah]], a bombing was directed against the synagogue of the ULIF. A bomb hidden in a motorcycle went off outside the synagogue, killing four pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/France.html#Paris Jewish Virtual History Tour, France]&lt;/ref&gt;

The bombing was the start of a string of other attacks by terrorists against Jews in Europe. In August 1981, a synagogue in [[Vienna]], Austria, was attacked by [[Palestinian militant|Palestinian]] gunmen, killing two people, and in October 1981, three people were killed when [[1981 Antwerp bombing|a bomb went off]] in the center of [[Antwerp]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Jewish Targets: Recent Attacks | publisher = The New York Times | date = September 7, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
Rabbi Louis-Germain Levy (1870-1946) trained at the Seminaire Israelite de France served as its first rabbi.

Rabbi Levy was succeeded by Rabbi Andre Chalom Zaoui (1916-2009) in 1946.

In 1970, Rabbi Daniel Farhi (1941- )was appointed the new senior rabbi and left ULIF in 1977 to create the second Reform synagogue of Paris, Mouvement Juif Liberal de France. Rabbi Michael Williams assumed the spiritual leadership of the community in the summer of 1977. He retired in 2014.
An Argentinian-Israeli rabbi, Yossef Kleiner, ordained by the Seminario rabinico was named as Williams successor and served the congregation until 2014.

In [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], the '''Wawalag''' were a pair of sisters who were daughters of [[Djanggawul]].  They lived in a [[whirlpool]] and were eaten by [[Yurlungur]], who was later forced to regurgitate them.  Their rebirth is used as a symbol in boy-to-man ceremonies.

'''Zināʾ''' (زِنَاء) or '''zina''' (زِنًى or زِنًا) is an [[Sharia|Islamic legal]] term referring to unlawful sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name=Semerdjian&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Elyse|last=Semerdjian|title=Zinah|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L.

''[[hudud]]'') crimes which have Quranically specified punishments.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;

Although stoning for zina is not mentioned in the Quran, all schools of traditional jurisprudence agreed on the basis of [[hadith]] that it is to be punished by stoning if the offender is ''muhsan'' (adult, free, Muslim, and having been married), with some extending this punishment to certain other cases and milder punishment prescribed in other scenarios.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Semerdjian/&gt; The offenders must have acted of their own free will.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; According to traditional jurisprudence, zina must be proved by testimony of four eyewitnesses to the actual act of penetration, or a confession repeated four times and not retracted later.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Semerdjian/&gt; Rape was traditionally prosecuted under different legal categories which used normal evidentiary rules.&lt;ref name=aquraishi&gt;A.

==Islamic scriptures==
Muslim scholars have historically considered zināʾ a [[hudud]] sin, or crime against God.&lt;ref&gt;Reza Aslan (2004), "The Problem of Stoning in the Islamic Penal Code: An Argument for Reform", ''UCLA Journal of Islamic and Near East Law'', Vol 3, No. 1, pp. 91-119&lt;/ref&gt; It is mentioned in both Quran and in the [[Hadith]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Qur'an===
The Qur'an deals with zināʾ in several places. First is the Qur'anic general rule that commands [[Muslims]] not to commit zināʾ:

{{quote|quote="Nor come nigh to fornication/adultery: for it is a shameful (deed) and an evil, opening the road (to other evils)."|source=Qur'an, Sura 17 (Al-Isra), [[Ayah|ayat]] 32&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|17|32|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Most of the rules related to zināʾ, fornication/adultery, and false accusations from a husband to his wife or from members of the community to chaste women, can be found in Surat an-Nur (the Light). The [[sura]] starts by giving very specific rules about punishment for zināʾ:

{{quote|quote="The woman and the man guilty of fornication/adultery,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment."|source=Qur'an, Sura 24 (An-Nur), [[Ayah|ayat]] 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|24|2|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
{{quote|quote="And those who accuse chaste women then do not bring four witnesses, flog them, (giving) eighty stripes, and do not admit any evidence from them ever; and these it is that are the transgressors. Except those who repent after this and act aright, for surely Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."|source=Qur'an, Sura 24 (An-Nur), [[Ayah|ayat]] 4-5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|24|4|e=5|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Hadith===
In [[Hadith]]s, the books most trusted in Islam after Quran, the definitions of Zina have been described as all the forms of [[sexual intercourse]], penetrative or non-penetrative, outside lawful marriage.&lt;ref name=Iqa&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/27259 | title=Ruling on the things that lead to zina – kissing, touching and being alone together | publisher=[[Islamqa.info]] | accessdate=13 August 2015 | author=Saalih al- Munajjid, Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=Abu Huraira reported Allah's Apostle as saying: “Allah has decreed for every son of Adam his share of zina, which he will inevitably commit. The zina of the eyes is looking, the zina of the tongue is speaking, one may wish and desire, and the private parts confirm that or deny it.”|source={{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|bukhari|8|77|609}}, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|33|6421}}}}

The public lashing and public lethal stoning punishment for zina are also prescribed in [[Hadith]]s, the books most trusted in Islam after Quran, particularly in ''Kitab Al-Hudud''.&lt;ref name="zmh"&gt;Z. Mir-Hosseini (2011), Criminalizing sexuality: zina laws as violence against women in Muslim contexts, SUR-Int'l Journal on Human Rights, 8(15), pp 7-33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ziba Mir-Hosseini (2001), Marriage on Trial: A Study of Islamic Family Law, {{ISBN|978-1860646089}}, pp. 140-223&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|date=January 2016}}

{{quote|quote='Ubada b. as-Samit reported: Allah's Messenger as saying: Receive teaching from me, receive teaching from me. Allah has ordained a way for those women. When an unmarried male commits adultery with an unmarried female, they should receive one hundred lashes and banishment for one year. And in case of married male committing adultery with a married female, they shall receive one hundred lashes and be stoned to death.|source={{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|17|4191}}}}

{{quote|quote=Allah's Messenger awarded the punishment of stoning to death to the married adulterer and adulteress and, after him, we also awarded the punishment of stoning, I am afraid that with the lapse of time, the people may forget it and may say: We do not find the punishment of stoning in the Book of Allah, and thus go astray by abandoning this duty prescribed by Allah. Stoning is a duty laid down in Allah's Book for married men and women who commit adultery when proof is established, or if there is pregnancy, or a confession.|source={{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|17|4194}}}}

{{quote|quote=Ma'iz came to the Prophet and admitted having committed adultery four times in his presence so he ordered him to be stoned to death, but said to Huzzal: If you had covered him with your garment, it would have been better for you.|source={{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|38|4364}}}}

[[Hadith Sahih al Bukhari]], another authentic source of sunnah, has several entries which refer to death by [[stoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Hina Azam (2012), Rape as a Variant of Fornication (Zina) in Islamic Law: An Examination of the Early Legal Reports, Journal of Law &amp; Religion, Volume 28, 441-459&lt;/ref&gt; For example,

{{quote|quote=Narrated 'Aisha: 'Utba bin Abi Waqqas said to his brother Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas, "The son of the slave girl of Zam'a is from me, so take him into your custody." So in the year of Conquest of Mecca, Sa'd took him and said. (This is) my brother's son whom my brother has asked me to take into my custody." 'Abd bin Zam'a got up before him and said, (He is) my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father, and was born on my father's bed." So they both submitted their case before Allah's Apostle. Sa'd said, "O Allah's Apostle! This boy is the son of my brother and he entrusted him to me." 'Abd bin Zam'a said, "This boy is my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father, and was born on the bed of my father." Allah's Apostle said, "The boy is for you, O 'Abd bin Zam'a!" Then Allah's Apostle further said, "The child is for the owner of the bed, and the stone is for the adulterer," He then said to Sauda bint Zam'a, "Veil (screen) yourself before him," when he saw the child's resemblance to 'Utba. The boy did not see her again till he met Allah.|source={{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|bukhari|9|89|293}}}}

Other [[hadith]] collections on zina between men and woman include:
 
*The stoning ([[Rajm]]) of a Jewish man and woman for having committed illegal sexual intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|bukhari|2|23|413}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Abu Hurairah]] states that the Prophet, in a case of intercourse between a young man and a married woman, sentenced the woman to [[stoning]]&lt;ref name=bhala&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P8MuP_POzh0C&amp;pg=PT979&amp;dq=punishment+for+zina+stoning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0GCSUeaiFZKGyQHKz4DAAQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ Understanding Islamic Law] By Raj Bhala, LexisNexis, May 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the young man to [[flogging]] and [[banishment]] for a year;
*[[Umar al-Khattab]] asserts that there was a revelation to the effect that those who are ''muhsan'' (i.e. an adult, free, Muslim who has previously enjoyed legitimate sexual relations in matrimony regardless of whether the marriage still exists) and have unlawful intercourse are to be punished with stoning.

===Rape and zina===
Few [[hadiths]] have been found regarding rape in the time of Muhammad. The most popular transmitted hadith given below indicates the ordinance of stoning for the rapist but no punishment and no requirement of four eyewitnesses for the rape victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Sexuality in Islam | publisher=Saqi Books | author=Bouhdiba, Abdelwahab | year=1985 | pages=288 | isbn=9780863564932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Sex and Sexuality in Islam | publisher=Nashriyat | author=Khan, Muhammad Aftab | year=2006 | location=The University of Michigan | pages=764 | isbn=9789698983048}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
{{quote|quote=When a woman went out in the time of the Prophet for prayer, a man attacked her and overpowered (raped) her. She shouted and he went off, and when a man came by, she said: That (man) did such and such to me. And when a company of the emigrants came by, she said: That man did such and such to me. They went and seized the man whom they thought had had intercourse with her and brought him to her. She said: Yes, this is he. Then they brought him to the Messenger of Allah. When he (the Prophet) was about to pass sentence, the man who (actually) had assaulted her stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, I am the man who did it to her. He (the Prophet) said to her: Go away, for Allah has forgiven you. But he told the man some good words (AbuDawud said: meaning the man who was seized), and of the man who had had intercourse with her, he said: Stone him to death. He also said: He has repented to such an extent that if the people of Medina had repented similarly, it would have been accepted from them.|source=[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]], [http://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/17 17:37], {{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|38|4366}}}}

====View of scholars====
{{quote|quote=Malik related to me from Nafi that a slave was in charge of the slaves in the khumus and he forced a slave-girl among those slaves against her will and had intercourse with her. Umar ibn al-Khattab had him flogged and banished him, and he did not flog the slave-girl because the slave had forced her.|source={{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|1|85|81|}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/89/10 | title=Bukhari, Book: 89 - Statements made under Coercion, Chapter 6: If a woman is compelled to commit illegal sexual intercourse against her will | publisher=sunnah.com | accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muwatta|usc=yes|41|3|15|}}}}

{{quote|quote=Malik related to me from Ibn Shihab that gave a judgment that the rapist had to pay the raped woman her bride-price. Yahya said that he heard Malik say, "What is done in our community about the man who rapes a woman, virgin or non-virgin, if she is free, is that he must pay the bride-price of the like of her. If she is a slave, he must pay what he has diminished of her worth. The hadd-punishment in such cases is applied to the rapist, and there is no punishment applied to the raped woman. If the rapist is a slave, that is against his master unless he wishes to surrender him."|source={{Hadith-usc|muwatta|usc=yes|36|16|14|}}}}

If a confession or the four witnesses required to prove a ''hadd'' crime are not available, but rape can be proved by other means, the rapist is sentenced under the ''[[Tazir|ta'zir]]'' system of judicial discretion.&lt;ref name=irfi&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rape against Muslim Women|url = http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_351_400/rape_against_muslim_women.htm|website = www.irfi.org|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the eleventh-century Maliki jurist [[Ibn 'Abd al-Barr]]:&lt;ref name=irfi/&gt;

{{quote|quote=The scholars are unanimously agreed that the rapist is to be subjected to the hadd punishment if there is clear evidence against him that he deserves the hadd punishment, or if he admits to that. Otherwise, he is to be punished (i.e., if there is no proof that the hadd punishment for zina may be carried out against him because he does not confess, and there are not four witnesses, then the judge may punish him and stipulate a punishment that will deter him and others like him). There is no punishment for the woman if it is true that he forced her and overpowered her, which may be proven by her screaming and shouting for help.|source=Al-Istidhkaar |4 = 7/146}}

===Homosexuality and zina===
Islamic teachings (in the ''[[hadith]]'' tradition&lt;ref name=somwr/&gt;) presume same-sex attraction, extol abstention and (in the [[Qur'an]]&lt;ref name=adang&gt;Camilla Adang (2003), Ibn Hazam on Homosexuality, [[:fr:Qantara|Al Qantara]], Vol. 25, No. 1, pp. 5-31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=somwr/&gt;) condemn consummation. [[LGBT in Islam#Passages from the Quran relating to homosexuality|The Quran forbids homosexual relationships]], in Al-Nisa, Al-Araf ( (verses 7:80-84, 11:69-83, 29:28-35 of the Qur'an using the story of Lot's people), and other surahs. For example,&lt;ref name=adang/&gt;&lt;ref name=somwr&gt;Stephen O. Murray and Will Roscoe (1997), Islamic Homosexualities: Culture, History, and Literature, {{ISBN|978-0814774687}}, New York University Press, pp. 88-94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michaelson|first=Jay|title=God Vs. Gay? The Religious Case for Equality|year=2011|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=9780807001592|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=We also sent Lot: He said to his people: "Do ye commit lewdness such as no people in creation (ever) committed before you? For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds."|source={{cite quran|7|80|end=81|s=ns}}}}
 
In another verse, the statement of prophet lot has been also pointed out,

{{quote|quote=Do you approach males among the worlds And leave what your Lord has created for you as mates? But you are a people transgressing.|source={{cite quran|26|165|end=166|s=ns}}, trans. Sahih International}}

Some scholars indicate this verse as the prescribed punishment for homosexuality in the Quran:
{{quote|quote="If two (men) among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, Leave them alone; for Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful."|source=Qur'an, Sura 4 (Al-Nisa), [[Ayah|ayat]] 16&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|16|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, there are different interpretations of the last verse where who the Quran refers to as "two among you". Pakistani scholar [[Javed Ahmed Ghamidi]] sees it as a reference to premarital sexual relationships between men and women. In his opinion, the preceding Ayat of Sura Nisa deals with prostitutes of the time. He believes these rulings were temporary and were abrogated later when a functioning state was established and society was ready for permanent rulings, which came in Sura Nur, Ayat 2 and 3, prescribing flogging as a punishment for adultery. He does not see stoning as a prescribed punishment, even for married men, and considers the Hadiths quoted supporting that view to be dealing with either rape or prostitution, where the strictest punishment under Islam for spreading "fasad fil arz", meaning mischief in the land, referring to egregious acts of defiance to the rule of law was carried out.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The Hadiths consider homosexuality as zina, and male homosexuality to be [[hudud|punished with death]].&lt;ref name=hz&gt;{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/38622|title=The punishment for homosexuality - islamqa.info|website=islamqa.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Abu Dawud states,&lt;ref name=somwr/&gt;{{nonspecific|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref name=mohelawa&gt;Mohamed S.

{{quote|quote=Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: The Prophet said: If you find anyone doing as Lot's people did,&lt;ref&gt;The [[sunnah]] and [[sura]]h describe the Lot's people in context of homosexuality and sodomy such as any form of sex between a man and woman that does not involve penetration of man's penis in woman's vagina.&lt;/ref&gt; kill the one who does it, and the one to whom it is done.|source={{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|38|4447}}}}

The discourse on homosexuality in Islam is primarily concerned with activities between men.

==Inclusions of the zināʾ definition==
Zināʾ encompasses [[extramarital sex]] (between a married Muslim man and a married Muslim woman who are not married to one another), and [[premarital sex]] (between unmarried Muslim man and unmarried Muslim woman). In Islamic history, zina also included [[Islamic views on slavery#Sexual intercourse|sex between Muslim man with a non-Muslim female slave]], when the slave was not owned by that Muslim man.&lt;ref name=keciali&gt;Kecia Ali (2006), ''Sexual Ethics and Islam'', {{ISBN|978-1851684564}}, Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically, zināʾ only refers to the act of penetration, while non-penetrative sex acts outside of marriage were censored by the Prophet as that which can lead to zināʾ.&lt;ref name="EI2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.understanding-islam.com/what-s-the-classical-definition-of-zina/|title=What’s the Classical Definition of Zina?|date=2003-05-13|website=UNDERSTANDING ISLAM|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharia, in describing zina, differentiates between an unmarried Muslim, a married Muslim (''Muhsan'') and a slave ([[Ma malakat aymanukum]]). The second one must be lethally stoned (rajm), while an unmarried Muslim and a slave must receive public lashing, and for a slave, the lashing count is half of an unmarried Muslim.&lt;ref name=adang/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Otto, Sharia Incorporated, Leiden University Press, {{ISBN|978-9087280574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusation process and punishment==

Islam requires evidence before a man or a woman can be punished for zināʾ. These are:&lt;ref name=keciali/&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref name=zmh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|17|4194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#A Muslim confesses to zina four separate times. However, if the confessor takes back his words before the punishment is enforced or during the punishment, he/she will be released and set free. The confessor is in fact encouraged to take back their confession.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/daruliftaa/7741|title=The Legal Penalty for Fornication - IslamQA|date=2012-07-28|website=IslamQA|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=al-Ikhtiyar li ta’lil al-Mukhtar|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=2/311–316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sengupta"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/26/world/facing-death-for-adultery-nigerian-woman-is-acquitted.html|title=Facing Death for Adultery, Nigerian Woman Is Acquitted|last=Sengupta|first=Somini|date=2003-09-26|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Four adult males who are held to be righteous and were never known to neglect a religious obligation or indulge in sin testifying that they all simultaneously observed the couple engaged in unlawful sexual intercourse without any doubt or ambiguity. They are able to say that they saw their private parts meet like the Kohl needle entering the Kohl bottle.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
#If the four witnesses take back their testimony before the actual punishment is enforced, then the punishment will be abandoned, and they (witnesses) will be punished for the crime of false accusation.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
#The witnesses are not allowed to delay their testimony from the time of the incident to the time of testifying. If they delayed testifying in the courts, the punishment will not be enforced, unless they were very distant from the Imam hence the delay was due to them travelling to the Imam.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;
#If the offense is punished by stoning to death, the witnesses must throw the stones.

If a pregnant woman confesses that her baby was born from an illegal relationship then she will be subject to conviction in the Islamic courts. In cases where there are no witnesses and no confession then the woman will not receive punishment just because of pregnancy. Women can fall pregnant without committing illegal sexual intercourse. A woman could be raped or coerced. In this case, she is a victim and not the perpetrator of a crime. Therefore, she cannot be punished or even accused of misconduct merely on the strength of her falling pregnant.&lt;ref name="Sengupta"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.islamtoday.net/node/1075|title=Pregnancy not proof of fornication {{!}} IslamToday - English|website=en.islamtoday.net|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Al-Mughni|last=Qudamah|first=Ibn|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four witnesses requirement for zina, that applies in case of an accusation against man or woman, is also revealed by Quranic verses 24:11 through 24:13 and various hadiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|24|13|s=nosup}}, Kerby Anderson (2007), Islam, Harvest House {{ISBN|978-0736921176}}, pp. 87-88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|muwatta|usc=yes|36|19|17|}}, {{Hadith-usc|muwatta|usc=yes|36|19|18|}}, {{Hadith-usc|muwatta|usc=yes|41|1|7|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Islamic scholars state that the requirement of four male eyewitnesses was to address zina in public. The testimony of women and non-Muslims is not admitted in cases of zināʾ or in other hadd crimes.

Any uninvolved Muslim witness, or victim of non-consensual sexual intercourse, who accuses a Muslim of zina, but fails to produce four adult, pious male eyewitnesses before a sharia court, commits the crime of false accusation (''Qadhf'', القذف), punishable with eighty lashes in public.&lt;ref&gt;J. Campo (2009), Encyclopedia of Islam, {{ISBN|978-0816054541}}, pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Mehdi (1997), [http://wrrc.wluml.org/sites/wluml.org/files/import/english/pubs/pdf/dossier18/D18.pdf#page=101 The offence of rape in the Islamic law of Pakistan], Women Living under Muslim Laws: Dossier, 18, pp. 98-108&lt;/ref&gt;

These requirements made zina virtually impossible to prove in practice.&lt;ref name=Semerdjian/&gt; Aside from "a few rare and isolated" instances from the pre-modern era and several recent cases, there is no historical record of stoning for zina being legally carried out.&lt;ref name=Semerdjian/&gt;&lt;ref name=Semerdjian2/&gt;

Some schools of Islamic jurisprudence ([[fiqh]]) created the principle of ''[[shubha (Arabic)|shubha]]'' (doubt). According to this principle, if there is room for doubt in the perpetrator's mind about whether the sexual act was illegal, he or she should not receive the hadd penalty, but could receive a less severe punishment at the discretion of the judge.&lt;ref name=zmh/&gt; Jurists had varying opinions on what counted as legitimate "doubt" for this purposes. A typical example is a man who has sex with his wife's or his son's slave. This is zināʾ - a man can lawfully have sex only with his own slave. But a man might plausibly believe that he had ownership rights over his wife's or his son's property, and so think that having sex with their slaves was legal. The Ḥanafī jurists of the Ottoman Empire applied the concept of doubt to exempt prostitution from the hadd penalty. Their rationale was that since legal sex is legitimized, in part, by payment (the dower paid by the husband to the wife upon marriage, or the purchase price of a slave), a man might plausibly believe that prostitution, which also involves a payment in return for sexual access, was legal.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Baldwin (2012), Prostitution, Islamic Law and Ottoman Societies, Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, 55, pp. 117-52&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that this principle did not mean that such acts were treated as legal: they remained offenses, and could be punished, but they were not liable for the hadd penalty of 100 lashes or stoning.

===Sunni practice===
All Sunni schools of jurisprudence agree that zināʾ is to be punished with stoning to death if the offender is a free, adult, married or previously married Muslim (''muhsan''). Persons who are not ''muhsan'' (i.e. a slave, a minor, never married or non-Muslim) are punished for zināʾ with one hundred lashes in public.&lt;ref name=mohelawa/&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Kecia Ali, Marriage and Slavery in Early Islam. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maliki]] school of Islamic jurisprudence considers pregnancy as sufficient and automatic evidence, unless there is evidence of rape. Other Sunni schools of jurisprudence rely on early Islamic scholars that state that a fetus can "sleep and stop developing for 5 years in a womb", and thus a woman who was previously married but now divorced may not have committed zina even if she delivers a baby years after her divorce.&lt;ref&gt;JANSEN, W. (2000), Sleeping in the Womb: Protracted Pregnancies in the Maghreb, The Muslim World, n. 90, p. 218-237&lt;/ref&gt; The also argue that the woman may have been forced or coerced (see section above, 'Accusation process and punishment').The position of modern Islamic scholars varies from country to country. For example, in Malaysia which officially follows the [[Shafi'i]] fiqh, Section 23(2) through 23(4) of the Syariah ([[Sharia]]) Criminal Offences (Federal Territories) Act 1997 state,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%2012/Act%20559.pdf Laws of Malaysia] SYARIAH CRIMINAL OFFENCES (FEDERAL TERRITORIES) ACT 1997, Government of Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|quote=
'''Section 23(2)''' - Any woman who performs sexual intercourse with a man who is not her lawful husband shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be liable to a fine not exceeding five thousand ringgit or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or to whipping not exceeding six strokes or to any combination thereof.

'''Section 23(3)''' - The fact that a woman is '''pregnant out of wedlock''' as a result of sexual intercourse performed '''with her consent''' shall be '''prima facie evidence''' of the commission of an offence under subsection (2) by that woman.

'''Section 23(4)''' - For the purpose of subsection (3), any woman who gives birth to a fully developed child within a period of six qamariah months from the date of her marriage shall be deemed to have been pregnant out of wedlock.

Minimal proof for zināʾ is still the testimony of four male eyewitnesses, even in the case of homosexual intercourse.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Prosecution of extramarital pregnancy as zināʾ, as well as prosecution of rape victims for the crime of zina, have been the source of worldwide controversy in recent years.&lt;ref name=hrwpakistan/&gt;&lt;ref name=hrwafghan&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/features/afghanistan-moral-crimes Afghanistan - Moral Crimes] Human Rights Watch (2012); Quote "Some women and girls have been convicted of zina, sex outside of marriage, after being raped or forced into prostitution. Zina is a crime under Afghan law, punishable by up to 15 years in prison."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shi'a practice===
Again, minimal proof for zināʾ is the testimony of four male eyewitnesses. The Shi'is, however, also allow the testimony of women, if there is ''at least one male witness'', testifying together with ''six women''. All witnesses must have seen the act in its most intimate details, i.e. the penetration (like "a stick disappearing in a kohl container," as the fiqh books specify). If their testimonies do not satisfy the requirements, they can be sentenced to eighty lashes for unfounded accusation of fornication (kadhf). If the accused freely admits the offense, the confession must be repeated ''four'' times, just as in Sunni practice. Pregnancy of a single woman is also sufficient evidence of her having committed zina.&lt;ref name=adang/&gt;{{quote needed|date=July 2017}}

==Human rights controversy==
[[File:Criminalization of premarital and extramarital sex as zina under sharia in Islam.SVG|thumb|360px|Muslim-majority regions with zina laws against consensual premarital and extramarital sex.&lt;ref&gt;Ziba Mir-Hosseini (2011), Criminalizing sexuality: zina laws as violence against women in Muslim contexts, SUR - Int'l Journal on Human Rights, 15, pp. 7-31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haideh Moghissi (2005), Women and Islam: Part 4 Women, sexuality and sexual politics in Islamic cultures, Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|0-415-32420-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2016}}]]
The zināʾ and rape laws of countries under [[Sharia|Sharia law]] are the subjects of a global human rights debate.&lt;ref&gt;KUGLE (2003), Sexuality, diversity and ethics in the agenda of progressive Muslims, In: SAFI, O.

(2007), Twenty-Five Years of Hudood Ordinances: A Review, Washington and Lee Law Review, n. 64, pp. 1291-1314&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of women in Afghan jails are victims of rape or domestic violence.&lt;ref name=hrwafghan/&gt; This has been criticized as leading to "hundreds of incidents where a woman subjected to rape, or gang rape, was eventually accused of zināʾ" and incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrcp-web.org/NCSW_Report.cfm|title=National Commission on the status of women's report on Hudood Ordinance 1979|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229095410/http://www.hrcp-web.org/NCSW_Report.cfm|archivedate=2007-12-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Pakistan, over 200,000 zina cases against women, under its Hudood laws, were under process at various levels in Pakistan's legal system in 2005.&lt;ref name=hrwpakistan&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/legacy/wr2k5/pdf/pakist.pdf Pakistan] Human Rights Watch (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to thousands of women in prison awaiting trial for zina-related charges, there has been a severe reluctance to even report rape because the victim fears of being charged with zina.&lt;ref&gt;Rahat Imran (2005), Legal Injustices: The Zina Hudood Ordinance of Pakistan and Its Implications for Women, Journal of International Women's Studies, Vol. 7, Issue 2, pp 78-100&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|date=January 2016}}

Iran has prosecuted many cases of zina, and enforced public stoning to death of those accused between 2001 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;BAGHI, E. (2007) [http://www.iranhumanrights.org/2008/08/baghibloodiedstone/ The Bloodied Stone: Execution by Stoning] International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE13/001/2008/en End Executions by Stoning - An Appeal] AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, 15 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Zina laws are one of many items of reform and secularization debate with respect to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Rehman J. (2007), The sharia, Islamic family laws and international human rights law: Examining the theory and practice of polygamy and talaq, International Journal of Law, Policy and the Family, 21(1), pp. 108-127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SAFWAT (1982), Offences and Penalties in Islamic Law. Islamic Quarterly, vol. 26, no. 3, pp. 149-181&lt;/ref&gt; In early 20th century, under the influence of colonial era, many penal laws and criminal justice systems were reformed away from Sharia in Muslim-majority parts of the world. In contrast, in the second half of 20th century, after respective independence, governments from Pakistan to Morocco, Malaysia to Iran have reverted to Sharia with traditional interpretations of Islam’s sacred texts. Zina and hudud laws have been re-enacted and enforced.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss A. M. (2003), Interpreting Islam and women's rights implementing CEDAW in Pakistan, International Sociology, 18(3), pp. 581-601&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary human right activists refer this as a new phase in the politics of gender in Islam, the battle between forces of traditionalism and modernism in the Muslim world, and the use of religious texts of Islam through state laws to sanction and practice gender-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;KAMALI (1998), Punishment in Islamic Law: A Critique of the Hudud Bill of Kelantan Malaysia, Arab Law Quarterly, vol. 13, no. 3, pp. 203-234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;QURAISHI, A (1996), Her Honor: An Islamic Critique of the Rape Laws of Pakistan from a Woman-Sensitive Perspective, Michigan Journal of International Law, vol. 18, pp. 287-320&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to human rights activists, Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider 'universal human rights' arguments as imposition of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and sexual codes that are central to Islam. Zina laws come under hudud — seen as crime against Allah; the Islamists refer to this pressure and proposals to reform zina and other laws as ‘contrary to Islam’. Attempts by international human rights to reform religious laws and codes of Islam has become the Islamist rallying platforms during political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;A.

'''Īśvarism''' is one of the religious streams in [[Hinduism]] along with other streams such as [[Brahmanism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Lokayata]].&lt;ref name="Congress1955"&gt;{{cite book|author=Indian History Congress|title=Proceedings, Indian History Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fH9CAAAAYAAJ|year=1955|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Das1977"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dharmanarayan Das|title=The early history of Kaliṅga: a socio-economic and cultural history of coastal Orissa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcgBAAAAMAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Punthi Pustak|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Īśvara==
In ancient texts of Indian philosophy, depending on the context, ''Īśvara'' can mean supreme soul, ruler, lord, king, queen  or husband. In medieval era Hindu texts, depending on the school of Hinduism, ''Īśvara'' means God, Supreme Being, personal god, or special [[Atman (Hinduism)|Self]].
