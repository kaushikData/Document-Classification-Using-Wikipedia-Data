'''"Amours mortes (tant de peine)"''' ([[English language|English]] translation: "Dead love (so much sadness)") was the [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourg]]ish entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1957]], performed in [[French language|French]] by [[France|French]] singer [[Danièle Dupré]].

The song is in the ''chanson'' style, with Dupré asking a former lover how she is meant to forget him and the pain his leaving caused her.

The song was performed second on the night (following [[Belgium]]'s [[Bobbejaan Schoepen]] with "[[Straatdeuntje]]" and preceding the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Patricia Bredin]] with "[[All (song)|All]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 8 points, placing 4th in a field of 10.

It was succeeded as [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourgish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1958|1958 Contest]] by [[Solange Berry]] with "[[Un grand amour]]".

'''Animal Rescue Sofia''' is a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) founded and registered in [[Sofia, Bulgaria]]. The organization is actively working to solve the issue with the homeless animals in [[Bulgaria]]. Its lies in the largest Bulgarian online dog forum – www.dog.bg.

Currently, Animal Rescue Sofia manages the largest dog shelter in Bulgaria – the Bogrov dog shelter, near Sofia. The organization takes care of 500 dogs there. Also ARS is running a free [[Animal neutering|spay/neuter clinic]] at the shelter and is running [[Animal adoption]] programs in Bulgaria as well as the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]].

Unfortunately their three-year lease expires in December 2013 and cannot be renewed. After investigating all other alternatives, Animal Rescue Sofia is now fundraising in order to purchase a nearby farm which has the right location, buildings and infrastructure for housing all the remaining animals and creating a model new shelter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arsofia.com/shelter&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation is funded almost entirely by private and corporate donations.

{{Contract law}}
The '''arm's length principle''' (ALP) is the condition or the fact that the parties to a transaction are independent and on an equal footing. Such a transaction is known as an "arm's-length transaction".

It is used specifically in [[contract law]] to arrange an agreement that will stand up to legal scrutiny, even though the parties may have shared interests (e.g., employer–employee) or are too closely related to be seen as completely independent (e.g., the parties have [[family|familial]] ties).

An arm's length relationship is distinguished from a [[fiduciary]] relationship, where the parties are not on an equal footing, but rather, power and [[information asymmetry|information asymmetries]] exist.

It is also one of the key elements in [[international taxation]] as it allows an adequate allocation of profit taxation rights among countries that conclude [[Tax treaty|double tax conventions]], through [[transfer pricing]], among each other. Transfer pricing and the arm's length principle was one of the focal points of the [[Base erosion and profit shifting|Base Erosion and Profit Shifting]] (BEPS) project developed by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and endorsed by the [[G-20 major economies|G20]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps-about.htm|title = OECD BEPS Project|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in contract law==
{{+rs|date=April 2016}}
A simple example of not at arm's length is the sale of [[real property]] from parents to children. The parents might wish to sell the property to their children at a price below market value, but such a transaction might later be classified by a court as a [[Gift (law)|gift]] rather than a [[bona fide]] sale, which could have tax and other legal consequences. To avoid such a classification, the parties need to show that the transaction was conducted no differently from how it would have been for an arbitrary third party. This could be done, for example, by hiring a disinterested third party, such as an appraiser or broker, who could offer a professional opinion that the sale price is appropriate and reflects the true value of the property.

The principle is often invoked to avoid any undue government influence over other bodies, such as the [[legal system]], the press, or the arts. For example, in the United Kingdom [[Arts Council]]s{{which|date=April 2016}} operate "at arm's length" in allocating the funds they receive from the [[government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quinn|first=R.B.M.|date=1997|title=Distance or intimacy? The arm's length principle, the British government and the arts council of Great Britain|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10286639709358066|journal=International Journal of Cultural Policy|volume=4 |issue=1|pages=127–159|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the workplace, [[supervisor]]s and [[management|managers]] deal with [[Employment|employee]] discipline and [[termination of employment]] at arm's length through the [[human resources]] department, if the company has one. In such cases, terminations and discipline must be rendered by staff who have the training and certification to do so legally. This is intended to protect the employer from [[legal recourse]] that employees may otherwise have in the event that it can be demonstrated that such discipline or terminations were not handled in accordance with the latest [[labor law]]s. For employees in [[trade union|unionised]] environments, [[Union steward|shop stewards]] can represent the employee, whereas the HR department represents the company, so that both sides are on a more equal footing and can resolve matters outside of court, using informal [[negotiation]]s or a [[grievance]], saving both sides time and money. The arm's length dealings in this case mean that both an employee and a supervisor each have a qualified advocate.

==International tax law==
The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) has adopted the principle in [http://www.oecd.org/ctp/treaties/2014-model-tax-convention-articles.pdf Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention], to ensure that [[Transfer pricing|transfer prices]] between companies of [[Multinational corporation|multinational enterprises]] are established on a [[market value]] basis. In this context, the principle means that prices should be the same as they would have been, had the parties to the transaction not been related to each other. This is often seen as being aimed at preventing profits being systematically deviated to lowest [[tax]] countries, although most countries are also concerned about prices that fail to meet the arm's length test due to inattention rather than by design and that shifts [[profit (economics)|profits]] to any other [[country]] (whether it has low or high tax rates).

The OECD Model Tax Convention provides the legal framework for [[governments]] to have their fair share of [[taxes]], and for [[Company|enterprises]] to avoid [[double taxation]] on their [[profit (economics)|profits]]. The [[Transfer pricing|arm's length standard]] is instrumental to determine ''how much'' of the profits should be attributed to one entity and, consequently, the extent of a country's tax claim on such entity. The OECD has developed thorough [http://www.oecd.org/ctp/transfer-pricing/transfer-pricing-guidelines.htm guidelines] on how the arm's length principle should be applied in this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oecd.org/ctp/transfer-pricing/transfer-pricing-guidelines.htm|title = OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this approach, a price is considered appropriate if it is within a range of prices that would be charged by independent parties dealing at arm's length. This is generally defined as a price that an independent buyer would pay an independent seller for an identical item under identical terms and conditions, where neither is under any compulsion to act.

Transfer pricing became a highly controversial topic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.taxjustice.net/topics/corporate-tax/transfer-pricing/|title = Tax Justice Network on Transfer Pricing|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the last years, which contributed to the development of the [[Base erosion and profit shifting|Base Erosion and Profit Shifting]] (BEPS) project by the OECD and with the endorsement of the G20.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[World Customs Organization|World Customs Organisation]] (WCO) and [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]] (WTO) have also adopted, in effect, the arm's length principle in [[Customs valuation]]s. The Agreement on Implementation of Article VII (known as the WTO Agreement on Customs Valuation or the “Valuation Agreement”) ensures that determinations of the customs value for the application of duty rates to imported goods are conducted in a neutral and uniform manner, precluding the use of arbitrary or fictitious customs values.&lt;ref&gt;United States Trade Representative - Customs Valuation, http://www.ustr.gov/trade-agreements/wto-multilateral-affairs/wto-issues/customs-issues/customs-valuation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/valuation/overview/wto-valuation-agreement.aspx|title = WCO: Overview on the WTO Valuation Agreement|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Budapest Turkish Memorial Cemetery''' ({{lang-tr|Budapeşte Türk Şehitliği}}) is a burial ground of [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman soldiers]] in [[Hungary]]. It is situated as a section within [[Budapest]]'s largest cemetery of [[New Public Cemetery, Budapest|New Public Cemetery]] ({{lang-hu|Új köztemető}}) at [[Kőbánya]] district of the city. Ottoman soldiers are buried in the cemetery, who participated on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Galicia front]] during the [[World War I]].

Established in 1926, the Turkish Memorial Cemetery holds 480 soldiers of [[Ottoman Army]]'s [[XV Corps (Ottoman Empire)|XV Corps]], who fought in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] as part of the [[Central Powers]] under the command of [[South Army (German Empire)|German Empire's South Army]] in the summer of 1916. Eleven graves are of unknown soldiers. The cemetery is walled and covers an area of {{convert|4598|m2|acre|abbr=on}} with a graveyard section of {{convert|1718|m2|acre|abbr=on}}. A plate on the entrance denotes the property. The [[flag of Turkey]] waves on a flagpole in the cemetery.&lt;ref name="dib"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://budapest.emb.mfa.gov.tr/ShowInfoNotes.aspx?ID=121443 |publisher=Dışişleri Bakanlığı |title=Budapeşte hakkında bilgiler, 15.06.2012 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Café Wars''' took place during the [[Algerian War]], as a part of the internal fighting in [[France]] between two rival [[Algeria]]n [[nationalist]] movements, the [[Mouvement National Algérien]] and the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de Libération National]] (which later became the ruling [[political party]] in independent [[Algeria]]).

The Café Wars are so called because part of the fighting took the form of [[bomb]] attacks and [[assassination]]s in [[café]]s, directed at supporters of the other party, as they struggled for control and influence over the large Algerian [[expatriate]] community and its organizations. Since both organizations operated underground, and were wanted by the French government, the line between a [[military]] and a [[civilian]] target was hard to draw, and often wilfully disregarded by the [[combatant]]s. Groups from both the MNA and the FLN resorted to gangland-style killings, intimidation and the murder of civilians to pursue their political goals and secure finances and influence. This led to the Café Wars being portrayed in France as acts of random [[terrorism]], and conflated with attacks on French [[pied-noirs|settlers]] in Algeria.

According to some estimates the Café Wars cost an estimated 5,000 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-341.html|title=Algeria - FLN|website=www.country-data.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official French figures are 3,975 dead and a total of 10,223 victims (dead or wounded) &lt;ref&gt;Un tournant de la " Bataille de Paris " [archive], Rémy Valat, Revue d'Histoire : Outre-Mers, 1er semestre 2004, N°342-343, Omar Carlier, « Violence(s) », dans Mohamed Harbi et Benjamin Stora (dir.), La Guerre d'Algérie, éd. Hachette, 2005, p.  511&lt;/ref&gt;

The Café Wars did not end before Algeria was granted independence in 1962, by the government of [[Charles de Gaulle]]. The FLN had by then routed the MNA's [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] units in Algeria, and for all practical purposes destroyed its organization in France.

'''Ciorbă''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈt͡ʃʲorbə}}), from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''shorba'' (شوربا) via [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''çorba'' is a general [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word used in [[Romania|Romania]] and the [[Republic of Moldova|Republic of Moldova]] to describe [[sour soup]]s consisting of various vegetables and meat. Most people differentiate between "supă" (soup) and "ciorbă" by the fact that ''supă'' has no added acid and is usually clear (with only one exception), while ''ciorbă'' may contain a wide variety of sour ingredients, usually [[lemon]]s, ''[[Borș (bran)|borș]]'', or ''zeamă de varză acră'' ([[sauerkraut]] juice). In [[Moldavia]] region, the word ''borș'' means simply any [[sour soup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adevarul.ro/locale/iasi/teorii-istorie-culinara-dezamagesc-borsul-mujdeiul-singurele-alimente-adevarat-romanesti-micii-inventati-cocosatu-mit-urban-1_55b8ee1df5eaafab2c10137a/index.html|title=Teorii de istorie culinară care ne dezamăgesc: borşul şi mujdeiul, singurele alimente cu adevărat româneşti.

Ciorbă is a widespread and popular dish in Romania, and is occasionally considered to have beneficual health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historia.ro/sectiune/general/articol/supa-si-ciorba-scurta-istorie|title=Supa şi ciorba: scurtă istorie|website=Historia.ro|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When served hot it is thought to stimulate digestion and be effective against colds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://a1.ro/lifestyle/food/ce-ciorba-prefera-sa-manance-romanii-id734738.html|title=Ce ciorbă preferă să mănânce românii|website=A1.ro|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Serbian climate''' is between a continental climate in the north, with cold winters, and hot, humid summers with well distributed rainfall patterns, and a more Adriatic climate in the south with hot, dry summers and autumns and rank daily average relatively cold winters with heavy inland snowfall. Differences in elevation, proximity to the [[Adriatic Sea]] and large river basins, as well as exposure to the winds account for climate differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-92892/Serbia |title=Serbia :: Climate |accessdate= |year=2007 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |pages=5 of 71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Northern Serbia possesses typical continental climate, with air masses from northern and western Europe which shape its climatic profile. South and South-west Serbia is subject to Mediterranean influences. However, the [[Dinaric Alps]] and other mountain ranges contribute to the cooling down of most of the warm air masses. Winters are quite harsh in [[Raška (region)|Raška]] (region) because of the mountains which encircle the plateau.&lt;ref&gt;Radovanović, M and Dučić, V, 2002, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002EGSGA..27.2283R Variability of Climate in Serbia in the Second Half of the 20th century], EGS XXVII General Assembly, Nice, 21 April to 26 April 2002, abstract #2283, '''27''':2283–, provided by the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] / [[NASA]] Astrophysics Data System&lt;/ref&gt; Mediterranean micro-regions exist throughout southern Serbia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ri.html |title=The World Factbook |website=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Zlatibor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpk-uzice.co.rs/en/tourism/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315155231/http://www.rpk-uzice.co.rs/en/tourism/index.php |archivedate=March 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Pčinja District around valley and river [[Pčinja (river)|Pčinja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel2serbia.com/rivers%20/river-pcinja-valley |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918082907/http://travel2serbia.com/rivers%20/river-pcinja-valley |archivedate=September 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual air temperature for the period 1961–90 for the area with an altitude of up to {{convert|300|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} is {{convert|10.9|°C|lk=on}}.

The '''coat of arms of Algiers''', the capital of [[Algeria]], was created after the country's [[independence]], it shows a [[fortress]], which symbolizes the [[Casbah]], and a [[boat]] which symbolize the Algerian [[:wikt:fleet|fleet]], vital to the country's economy in older times, as well as two [[lion]]s, which can be seen in ''Bab Azzoun'', one of the [[gate]]s of the city. The [[crescent]] symbolizes [[Islam]], the [[state religion]], the [[feather]] to symbolize scientific and [[cultural]] development. The [[wikt:sheaf|sheaf]] of corn (the main [[crop]] of the country)  symbolizes [[agriculture]], while the [[wheel]] symbolizes [[industry]] (Algiers is the largest industrial center of the country).

On top of the shield is a [[mural crown]].

==Former arms==
[[File:Algiers Coat of Arms (French Algeria).svg|left]]

During the time as a French colony, the arms of Algiers had a [[bend sinister (heraldry)|bend sinister]] [[or (heraldry)|or]] in the arms, on which was a lion proper.

The '''flag of [[Bago Region]]''' depicts a [[Hamsa (bird)|hamsa]] on a blue background. The name "Bago Division" ({{my|ပဲခူးတိုင်း}}) is written underneath the bird, despite the region no longer bearing that name. The former [[flag of Mon State]] is very similar to the flag of Bago Region, but its hamsa and text have different proportions and designs.

In local legend, the [[Bago, Myanmar|city of Bago]] was established on the location where a hamsa sought refuge during a massive flood, hence the adoption of the bird on the flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kuipers |first1=Ludo |title=Bago Region {{!}} Flag {{!}} Myanmar {{!}} OzOutback |url=https://ozoutback.com.au/Myanmar/flags/slides/14_Bago_Region.html |website=ozoutback.com.au |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GloryStar Satellite Systems''' is a [[Direct-broadcast satellite|Direct to Home]] religious based [[satellite television]] service. The service offers viewers and churches a selection of [[Christian]] radio and television services.

Glorystar broadcasts its channels via the [[Galaxy 19]] {{Ku band}} satellite, which covers most of [[North America|North]] and [[Central America]], as well as the [[Caribbean]]. 

All channels are religious, family friendly and distributed as non-encrypted or [[free-to-air]] (FTA) allowing viewers to receive programming without a monthly subscription fee.

==Technology==
The reception of Glorystar programming requires reception of signals with a FTA receiver capable of receiving digital Ku-band signals, and a 90cm /36" dish aimed at 97° W, the [[orbital slot]] for Galaxy 19.

Glorystar offers GEOSATpro DVR1100c and DSR100c / 200c model receivers, and provides automatic channel and firmware updates to them via satellite. New Christian channels are automatically added to the receiver's channel list.

Additional channels are also available for free with the Glorystar satellite system if the customer chooses to scan their receiver to add these channels. The above satellite location includes most ethnic channels from [[GlobeCast World TV]].

'''HMS ''Erebus''''' was a {{sclass-|Hecla|bomb vessel}} designed by Sir Henry Peake and constructed by the [[Royal Navy]] in [[Pembroke Dock|Pembroke dockyard]], [[Wales]] in 1826. The vessel was named after the dark region in [[Hades]] of [[Greek mythology]], called [[Erebus]]. The 372-ton ship was armed with two [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]] – one {{convert|13|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and one {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} – and 10 guns. The ship took part in the [[Ross expedition]] of 1839 to 1843 and was abandoned during the third [[Franklin's lost expedition|Franklin Expedition]]. The sunken wreck was discovered in September 2014 after a long search.&lt;ref name=Cbc2014-09-27/&gt;

==Ross expedition==
{{main|Ross expedition}}

After two years' service in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], ''Erebus'' was refitted as an exploration vessel for [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] service, and on 21 November 1840 – captained by [[James Clark Ross]] – she departed from [[Van Diemen's Land]] for Antarctica in company with {{HMS|Terror|1813|2}}. In January 1841, the crews of both ships landed on [[Victoria Land]], and proceeded to name areas of the landscape after [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] politicians, scientists, and acquaintances. [[Mount Erebus]], on [[Ross Island]], was named after one ship and [[Mount Terror (Antarctica)|Mount Terror]] after the other.

The crew then discovered the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], which they were unable to penetrate, and followed it eastward until the lateness of the season compelled them to return to Van Diemen's Land. The following season, 1842, Ross continued to survey the "Great Ice Barrier", as it was called, continuing to follow it eastward. Both ships returned to the [[Falkland Islands]] before returning to the Antarctic in the 1842–1843 season. They conducted studies in [[magnetism]], and returned with [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] data and collections of [[Botany|botanical]] and [[Ornithology|ornithological]] specimens. The plants were described in the resulting ''[[Flora Antarctica|The Botany of the Antarctic Voyage of H.M. Discovery Ships Erebus and Terror in the years 1839–1843, under the Command of Captain Sir James Clark Ross]]''.

Birds collected on the first expedition were described and illustrated by [[George Robert Gray]] and [[Richard Bowdler Sharpe]] in ''The Zoology of the Voyage of HMS Erebus &amp; HMS Terror. Birds of New Zealand'', 1875. The revised edition of Gray (1846) (1875). The future botanist [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], then aged 23, was assistant-surgeon to [[Robert McCormick (explorer)|Robert McCormick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Hooker, Sir Joseph Dalton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Franklin expedition==

{{Main|Franklin's lost expedition}}

For their next voyage to the [[Arctic]] under Sir [[John Franklin]], both ''Erebus'' and {{HMS|Terror|1813|2}} were outfitted with [[steam engine]]s from the [[London and Greenwich Railway]] [[steam locomotive]]s. That of ''Erebus'' was rated at {{convert|25|hp|kW|lk=in}} and could propel the ship at {{convert|4|kn|km/h|lk=in}}. The ships carried 12 days' supply of coal.&lt;ref name=HR199&gt;{{cite journal |title=British loco boiler at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean |first=Harry |last=Gow |journal=Heritage Railway |issue=199 |date=2015-02-12 |publisher=Mortons Media Group Ltd |location=Horncastle |page=84 |issn=1466-3562}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ships had iron plating added to their [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]s. Sir John Franklin sailed in ''Erebus'', in overall command of the expedition, and ''Terror'' was again commanded by [[Francis Crozier]]. The expedition was ordered to gather magnetic data in the [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]] and to complete a crossing of the [[Northwest Passage]], which had already been partly charted from both the east and west but had never been entirely navigated.

The ships were last seen entering [[Baffin Bay]] in August 1845. The disappearance of the Franklin expedition set off a massive search effort in the Arctic. The broad circumstances of the expedition's fate were first revealed when [[Hudson's Bay Company]] doctor [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]] collected artifacts and testimony from local [[Inuit]] in 1853. Later expeditions up to 1866 confirmed these reports.

Both ships had become icebound and had been abandoned by their crews, totaling about 130 men, all of whom died from a variety of causes, including [[hypothermia]], [[scurvy]], and [[starvation]] while trying to trek overland to the south. Subsequent expeditions until the late 1980s, including [[Autopsy|autopsies]] of crew members, also revealed that ''Erebus'' and ''Terror''{{'}}s shoddily canned [[Military rations|rations]] may have been tainted by both [[lead poisoning|lead]] and [[botulism]]. Oral reports by local Inuit that some of the crew members resorted to [[cannibalism]] were at least somewhat supported by [[Forensic science|forensic]] evidence of cut marks on the [[Skeleton|skeletal]] remains of crew members found on [[King William Island]] during the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keenleyside |first1=Anne |last2=Bertulli |first2=Margaret |last3=Fricke |first3=Henry C. |last-author-amp=yes |title=The final days of the Franklin Expedition: new skeletal evidence |journal=Arctic |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=36–46 |date=March 1997 |format=PDF |url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic50-1-36.pdf |accessdate=2008-01-26 |doi=10.14430/arctic1089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A British transport ship, ''Renovation'', spotted two ships on a large ice floe off the coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in April 1851. The identities of the ships were not confirmed. It was suggested over the years that these might have been ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'', though it is now certain they could not have been and were most likely abandoned [[whaling ship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/libraries/units/archives/digital/abb/1852k.html |title=Arctic Blue Books -British Parliamentary Papers Abstract, 1852k. |website=University of Manitoba Libraries - Archives and Special Collections |year=1852 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In art, entertainment, and media ===
HMS ''Erebus'' is featured, often alongside HMS ''Terror'', in fictional works that use the Franklin expedition in their backstories, such as:
*[[Captain Nemo]] mentions ''Erebus'' and [[HMS Terror (1813)|''Terror'']], in the context of [[James Clark Ross|Captain Ross]]' expedition, in [[Jules Verne]]'s ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1870), as background to establish the difficulty of reaching the [[South Pole]], while Captain Nemo stands upon its fictional summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Jules Verne |last=Verne |first=Jules |title=[[20000 Leagues Under the Sea]] |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |year=1962 |ISBN=0-553-21063-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Ice Blink: The Tragic Fate of Sir John Franklin's Lost Polar Expedition'' (2001), by Scott Cookman, offers a journalistic account of Franklin's expedition.
*''Erebus'' and ''Terror'' appear in [[Dan Simmons]]' novel ''[[The Terror (novel)|The Terror]]'' (2007), which is a fictional account of the expedition's fate.
**''[[The Terror (TV series)|The Terror]]'' is a 2018 American television series based on Simmons' book.
*[[Clive Cussler]]'s novel, ''[[Arctic Drift]]'' (2008), uses ''Erebus'' and ''Terror'' as part of the plot as well as the establishing backstory of the ill-fated expedition.
*"Erebus" (2012) is a radio play for [[BBC Radio 4]], based on the Franklin expedition, by British poet [[Jo Shapcott]].
*''Erebus: The Story of a Ship'' (2018, published by Cornerstone, a division of [[Random House]]), by [[Michael Palin]], is a biography of the ship, covering its loss in the Arctic, Antarctic exploration, and back to its construction in Milford Haven. The book was serialized on [[BBC Radio 4]] in 2018.
*''Erebus and Terror'' is the sixth track on the 2016 album, ''[[Further Than Rust]]'' by Canadian folk band, [[Nickeltree]].

'''Hispasat 1C''' is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[communications satellite]] which is operated by [[Hispasat]]. It was constructed by [[Alcatel Space]] and is based on the [[Spacebus 3000|Spacebus-3000B2]] [[satellite bus]]. Launch occurred on 3 February 2000, at 23:30. The launch was contracted by [[International Launch Services|ILS]], and used an [[Atlas II|Atlas IIAS]] carrier rocket flying from [[Spaceport Florida Launch Complex 36|SLC-36B]] at  [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]].

It has a mass of {{convert|3113|kg}}, and an expected service life of 15 years.

Following its launch and on-orbit testing, it was placed in [[geostationary orbit]] at 30° West, from where it provides communications services to [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]]. It is expected to remain in service until at least 2015.

The '''International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology''' ('''IUBMB''') is an international [[non-governmental organisation]] concerned with [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]]. Formed in 1955 as the '''International Union of Biochemistry''', the union has presently 77 member countries (as of 2008).&lt;ref name="About"&gt;[http://www.iubmb.org/index.php?id=8 About IUBMB.] Retrieved 01 Mai 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

IUBMB organizes a triennial Congress of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and sponsors more frequent conferences, symposia, educational activities and lectures.

It publishes standards on biochemical nomenclature, including [[enzyme]] nomenclature, in some cases jointly with the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC).

IUBMB has instituted the Wood Whelan Research fellowship scheme for budding researchers. It is considered as a prestigious award for doctoral students. Candidates are selected based on a competitive project proposal and reference letters. The award scheme provides opportunity to work on a specified project in a different laboratory in a foreign country.

It is associated with the journals ''[[Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education]]'' (formerly ''Biochemical Education''), ''[[BioEssays]]'', ''[[BioFactors]]'', ''[[Biotechnology and Applied Biochemistry]]'', ''IUBMB Life'', ''[[Molecular Aspects of Medicine]]'' and ''[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Biochemical Sciences]]''.

[[Homosexuality]] in [[Serbia]] was technically legal 1807-1813 (because ''[[Karađorđe]] Crimminal Code'' omitted any references to it) and between 1858, when the Ottoman Empire of which Serbia was nominally a vassal decriminalised male homosexuality, and 1860 when prince [[Miloš Obrenović]] pushed through a new Criminal Code which punished male anal intercourse with 6-48 months imprisonment). From 1860 it was legally punishable through several regime changes until it was finally decriminalised once again in 1994.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-25927595 |title=Where is it illegal to be gay? |accessdate=12 February 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first pride walk took place in 2001.

| ''[[Chuanr]]''
| [[File:Barbecued lamb sticks.jpg|127px]]
| |[[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]: ''Kewap'', [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 串儿 ''[[Chuanr]]'' or 羊肉串 ''Yangrouchuan'' — The most popular Xinjiang dish in China: chunks of mutton or mutton fat pierced on metal (or wood or bamboo) skewers, grilled on a coal-fired barbecue, and served with [[cumin]] and [[Chili pepper|chili]] paste. Across Xinjiang, and neighbouring regions such as Kyrgyzstan, the mutton fat is valued equivalent to or more than the meat itself, as it provides energy during the harsh winter months. It has also become a popular street food all over north and west China, where a wide variety of foods are cooked in such a manner. Chuanr was traditionally made from lamb (yáng ròu chuàn, 羊肉串), which is still the most common, but now, chicken, pork, beef, and seafood are used. It is typically roasted over charcoal or electric heat, but it is sometimes cooked by deep frying in oil (popular in Beijing).

This is a list of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian dictatorships]].

The list distinguishes between totalitarian and [[authoritarian]] regimes, listing the former and not the later. Totalitarianism is an extreme version of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism primarily differs from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist that are not under governmental control.&lt;ref name="Sondrol"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sondrol |first1 = P.

'''Luba-Katanga''', also known as '''Luba-Shaba''' and '''''Kiluba''''', is one of the two major [[Bantu language]]s spoken in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] called "Luba". (See [[Luba-Kasai]].) It is spoken mostly in the south-east area of the country by the [[Luba people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Batibo | first=Herman | title=Language Decline and Death in Africa | publisher=Multilingual Matters | pages=74 | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yoZ_fU_B0KgC | isbn=1-85359-808-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiluba is spoken in the area around [[Kabongo, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Kabongo]], [[Kamina]], [[Luena, Moxico Province|Luena]], [[Lubudi Territory|Lubudi]], [[Malemba-Nkulu Territory|Malemba Nkulu]], Mulongo, and [[Kaniama Territory|Kaniama]], mostly in [[Katanga Province|Katanga]]. Some 500 years ago or more, the Luba Kasai left Katanga and settled in the [[Kasai region|Kasai]]; since then, Luba Kasai (Chiluba) has evolved until it is no longer mutually intelligible with Luba Katanga.

'''Maghas''' or '''Maas''' — more properly, Mags or Maks — was the capital city of [[Alania]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.hu/books?id=Rgxm_E2Fq1gC&amp;pg=PA257 ''The Jews of Khazaria'' by Kevin Alan Brook]&lt;/ref&gt; a medieval kingdom in the [[Greater Caucasus]]. It is known exclusively from [[Islamic]] sources and its location is uncertain, with some authors favouring [[North Ossetia]] and others pointing to [[Arkhyz]] in modern-day [[Karachay–Cherkessia]], where three 10th-century churches still stand. The destruction of Maghas is ascribed to [[Batu Khan]], a [[Mongol]] leader and a grandson of [[Genghis Khan]], in the beginning of 1239. Some Russian geographers, like D. V. Zayats, point to a location in [[Ingushetia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D.V.Zayats |year=2001 |title=Maghas – "The Sun City" – New Capital of Ingushetia |url=http://geo.1september.ru/2001/11/4.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502001233/http://geo.1september.ru/2001/11/4.htm |archivedate=2 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[capital (political)|capital]] city is [[Helsinki]].

Around 5.4 million people reside in Finland, with the majority concentrated in the southern part of country.&lt;ref name="Population clock"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vaestorekisterikeskus.fi/vrk/home.nsf/pages/index_eng |title=The current population of Finland |work=Population Register Center |accessdate=2007-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the eighth largest country in Europe in terms of area and the most [[list of countries by population density|sparsely populated]] country in the [[European Union]]. The native language for most of the population is [[Finnish language|Finnish]], a member of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]] most closely related to [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and one of the four [[languages of the European Union|EU languages]] not of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] origin. The second official language, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], is spoken by a 5.5 percent minority.&lt;ref name="Population 2006-12-31"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tilastokeskus.fi/til/vaerak/2006/vaerak_2006_2007-03-23_tie_001_en.html |title=The population of Finland in 2006 |work=Statistics Finland |date=2006-12-31 |accessdate=2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finland is a [[Constitutional democracy|democratic]], [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[republicanism|republic]] with a central government and local governments in 415 municipalities. [[Greater Helsinki]] (including [[Helsinki]], [[Espoo]], [[Vantaa]] and Kauniainen) totals a million residents and a third of the GDP. Other major cities include [[Tampere]], [[Turku]], and [[Oulu]].

Finland was historically part of Sweden and from 1809 [[Grand Duchy of Finland|an autonomous Grand Duchy]] within the [[Russian Empire]]. [[Finland's declaration of independence]] in 1917 from [[Russia]] was followed by a civil war, [[Military history of Finland during World War II|wars against the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany]], and a period of official neutrality during the [[Cold War]]. Finland joined the [[United Nations]] in 1955 and the [[European Union]] in 1995 and participates in the [[Eurozone]]. Finland has been ranked the [[List of countries by Failed States Index#Sustainable|second most stable country in the world]], in a survey based on social, economic, political, and military indicators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=292&amp;Itemid=452 The Failed States Index 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080714022854/http://www.fundforpeace.org/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=292&amp;Itemid=452 |date=2008-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Finland was a relative latecomer to [[industrialization]], remaining a largely agrarian country until the 1950s. Thereafter economic development was rapid, and the country reached the world's top income levels in the 1970s. Between 1970 and 1990, Finland build an extensive welfare state. In the aftermath of the severe depression of the early 1990s successive governments have reformed the Finnish economic system through some [[privatisation]], [[deregulation]], and tax cuts.--&gt;

Finland has seen excellent results in many [[Finland#International rankings|international comparisons of national performance]] such as the share of high-technology manufacturing, the rate of gross domestic product growth, and the protection of civil liberties.&lt;ref name="World Audit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldaudit.org/countries/finland.htm |title=Finland: World Audit Democracy Profile |work=WorldAudit.org |accessdate=2007-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030113921/http://www.worldaudit.org/countries/finland.htm |archivedate=2013-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Plava Grobnica''''' ({{lang-sr-cyrl|Плава гробница}}, "The Blue Tomb") is an ode written by [[Serbia]]n poet [[Milutin Bojić]] during [[World War I]]. It is dedicated to the soldiers that were buried in the sea near [[Vido]] island, [[Greece]]. In his unforgettable poem, Bojić expressed the tragic fate of Serbia, whose army had passed through Montenegro and Albania to the Greek islands of Corfu and Vido, where over 5000 Serbian soldiers were buried at sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discoverserbia.org/sr/ostrvo-krf-vido Ostrva Krf i Vido]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bojić survived the exodus from Serbia and the desperation of [[Corfu]], and yet in the end succumbed to [[tuberculosis]] in [[Salonika]]. "Our church bells toll the dead instead of the hours," Bojić wrote of seeing his comprades-at-arms dying around him. At the time of the Serbian retreat he had been working on an epic poem, ''Cain'', in which he compared [[Bulgaria]]'s attack on [[Serbia]] (that precipitated the retreat) to the biblical story of [[Cain and Abel]]. The poem was one of the few things he carried with him as he made the winter journey over the mountains. Upon arriving at the Adriatic only to see his fellow Serbs being thrown out to the sea for burial, he penned one of the most moving [[war poems]] of his generation -- ''Plava Grobnica'' or ''Ode to a Blue Sea Tomb''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3237">[[Image:Saratov Catholic Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Cathedral of St. Clement in Saratov (1917)]]
The [[Roman Catholic]] '''diocese of Tiraspol''' (''Dioecesis Tiraspolitanus'') was established in 1848, as a [[suffragan diocese|suffragan see]] of the [[Metropolitan Archdiocese of Mohilev|Archdiocese of Mogilev]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14739a.htm Entry of Tiraspol in the Catholic Encyclopedia].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dt511.html Diocese of Tiraspol] in Catholic Hierarchy.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic population for which it catered was largely German in ethnic origin, although there were also significant Polish and Armenian Catholic communities. The see city of the diocese was [[Saratov]] rather than [[Tiraspol]]; the choice of Tiraspol for the name of the diocese may have been because the city had been the cathedral city of the fourteenth century diocese of [[Kherson]]. The first Roman Catholic bishop of Tiraspol, appointed in 1850, was Ferdinand Helanus Kahn, OP, a German [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]. Wincenty Lipski, a Pole, was appointed auxiliary bishop in 1856.

After Bishop Kahn's death in 1864, successive bishops were Franz Xaver Zottmann, 1872–1888; Anton Zerr, 1889–1902; [[Eduard von der Ropp]], 1902–1903; [[Joseph Kessler]], from 1904. Under Soviet rule, the diocese, as with the structures of many other churches and religious communities, was the subject of repression. Bishop Kessler went into exile in 1918,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvgs.cu-portland.edu/priests/joseph_aloysius_kessler.html Joseph Aloysius Kessler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210053507/http://cvgs.cu-portland.edu/priests/joseph_aloysius_kessler.html |date=2009-02-10 }} in the Center for Volga German studies at the [[Concordia University, Portland]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the see of Tiraspol became formally vacant on his death in 1933. Meanwhile, there were attempts to organise the diocese under a series of [[apostolic administrator]]s, viz.: Johannes Roth, [[Aleksander Frison|Alexander Frison]], and Augustin Baumtrog, but these attempts ended in increased repression, and in two cases, their execution (Frison in 1937, Roth in 1938).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040601041323/http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/rotunda/2209/Catholic_Russia.html Catholic Russia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The diocese remained inactive, but formally in existence, until its formal suppression in 2002, when the new [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint Clement at Saratov|diocese of St Clement in Saratov]] was erected, incorporating territory within Russia belonging to the former diocese of Tiraspol. Territory of the former diocese now situated in [[Moldova]] and [[Transnistria]] was assigned to the '''Apostolic Administration of Moldova''', erected in 1993. Territory of the former diocese in southern [[Ukraine]] is now part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Odessa-Simferopol|Diocese of Odessa-Simferopol]].

==Reception==
Leslie Felperin of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote: "As he did with ''[[Killer (1998 film)|Killer]]'', Omirbayev once again offers a quietly scathing portrait of his homeland, which, on the evidence here, is on the verge of losing its soul in the pursuit of Range Rovers, banal soap operas and other ephemeral pleasures. ... [T]here's much to admire in the film's elegantly classical tempo and the way Omirbayev achieves so much with so little[.]"&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{Cite web|last=Felperin|first=Leslie|date=2012-05-18|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117947574?refcatid=31|title=Student|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
