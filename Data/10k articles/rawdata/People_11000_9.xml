      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1366">'''Achimelech''' may refer to:
* '''[[Ahimelech]]''' was the priest of [[Nob, Israel|Nob]] who extended hospitality to [[David]] during his flight from the court of Saul. As reported to King Saul by [[Doeg the Edomite]], Ahimelech gave David five loaves of holy bread, the sword of Goliath, and, though reputed to have consulted God for David by Doeg, this was simply propaganda against the priests of Nob. For this he was put to death personally by Doeg, together with all the priests of Nob, except [[Abiathar]], his son, who escaped and joined David (I Samuel 21-22).
* '''Achimelech''', a [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]], companion of the outlawed [[David]] (1 Samuel 26:6).
* There is an '''Achimelech''' spoken of (2 Samuel 8:17, and 1 Chronicles 18:16; 24:3, 6, 31), as a "son of [[Abiathar]]" and an associate of [[Zadok]] in the priesthood. As this position is usually attributed to "Abiathar, son of Achimelech" it is thought that the reading "Achimelech, son of Abiathar" is due to an accidental transposition of the text of [[Books of Kings|Kings]], and that this transposition has affected the text of [[Paralipomenon]].
* '''Achimelech''' is a name given to [[Achish]], King of [[Gath (city)|Gath]], in the title of Psalm 33. Some texts have [[Abimelech]].

'''Alfred Allen Lary''' (September 26, 1928 – July 10, 2001) was an American [[professional baseball]] [[baseball player|player]]. He was a right-handed [[pitcher]] who appeared in 29 [[games played]]—16 as a pitcher, 12 as a [[pinch runner]] and one as a [[pinch hitter]]—for the [[Chicago Cubs]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (1954–55; 1962). Prior to playing pro baseball, Lary had an outstanding [[college football]] career at the [[University of Alabama]]. He was the older brother of [[Detroit Tigers]]' [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] pitcher [[Frank Lary]].

Lary was listed as {{convert|6|ft|3|in}} tall and {{convert|185|lb}}. He signed his first pro contract with the Cubs before the 1951 season, spent 1953 in military service, and made his Major League debut on September 25, 1954, in a start against the [[Cincinnati Reds|Cincinnati Redlegs]] at [[Wrigley Field]]. The opposing pitcher was [[Art Fowler]]. Lary pitched six [[inning]]s and allowed two [[earned runs]], receiving no decision in the 4–2 Cubs victory. He was with the Cubs briefly in 1955 and was used in four games, all as a [[pinch runner]]. It would be seven years before he reached the Major League level again.

Lary gave up [[Willie Mays]]' 324th career [[home run]], a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]], in [[Candlestick Park]] on April 28, 1962. His career totals for his 16 career [[games pitched]] include a [[win-loss record (pitching)|win-loss record]] of 0–1, four [[games started]], four [[games finished]], and an [[earned run average|ERA]] of 6.52.  In 40 [[innings pitched]] he [[strikeouts|struck out]] 22, [[bases on balls|walked]] 22, and allowed 45 [[hit (baseball)|hits]]. He spent his entire, 13-year baseball career as a member of the Cubs' organization.

Lary died by accidental drowning in his hometown of [[Northport, Alabama]], at the age of 72. Lary had [[Parkinson's disease]] at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fugrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wQUGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3487,983500&amp;dq=al+lary+drowning&amp;hl=en|title=Kentucky New Era - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He began work as an editor with [[Paul Hamlyn]]'s ''Octopus Group'',&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; and his passions for wine and writing led to articles and books on wine, after four years in publishing in 1988.&lt;ref name=wpb&gt;winepros.com.au [http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/authors/author_profile.jsp?authorid=219 Andrew Jefford profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910160615/http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/authors/author_profile.jsp?authorid=219 |date=10 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the drinks writer for ''[[London Evening Standard|The Evening Standard]]'', the evening newspaper for the London region,&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; between 1992 and 2002, occasionally presents ''The Food Programme'' on [[BBC Radio 4]],&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; and writes a bi-monthly column for ''[[Decanter (magazine)|Decanter]]''.

Among his books are ''The New France'' (2002), about which Jefford has stated, "..[my theme is] the championing of individuals rather than multi-nationals, of families rather than corporate shareholders, of agriculture rather than industry, of authenticity of origin rather than marketing stratagems".&lt;ref&gt;Kissack, Chris, thewinedoctor.com [http://www.thewinedoctor.com/otherresources/jefford.shtml Wine Books: Andrew Jefford]&lt;/ref&gt;

On television, he has worked as a chef's assistant and has reported on whisky for ''Food File'' ([[Channel 4]], 1996) and ''SCAM'' ([[Carlton Television]], 2003)

He has won eight [[Glenfiddich Food and Drink Awards|Glenfiddich Awards]],&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; has twice been named ''British Beer Writer of the Year'', and was named ''Communicator of the Year'' in the 2001 International Wine and Spirit Competition.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

'''Benoit Joseph André Rigaud''' (1761 – 18 September 1811) was the leading [[Gens de couleur|mulatto]] military leader during the [[Haitian Revolution]]. Among his [[Mentorship|protégé]]s were [[Alexandre Pétion]] and [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]], both future [[List of Presidents of Haïti|presidents of Haïti]].

==Early life==
Rigaud was born on 17 January 1761 in [[Les Cayes]], [[Saint-Domingue]], to André Rigaud, a wealthy French planter, and Rose Bossy Depa, a slave woman. His father acknowledged the [[mixed-race]] (mulatto) boy as his at a young age, and sent him to [[Bordeaux]], where he was trained as a goldsmith.{{sfnp|McGlynn|Drescher|1992|page=175}}

André Rigaud was known to have worn a brown-haired wig with straight hair to resemble a white man as closely as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbC3CJ-RnRQC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;lpg=PA204&amp;dq=Andr%C3%A9+Rigaud+wore+a+wig&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mZVZHyvdke&amp;sig=RewBDTvX6okvKxogdeHAK7mGCQU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tkK8VMfBBcqUNrHpgagM&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=Andr%C3%A9%20Rigaud%20wore%20a%20wig&amp;f=false |title=Elusive Origins: The Enlightenment in the Modern Caribbean Historical Imagination |author=Miller, Paul B. |page=204 |accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBHaAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=Andr%C3%A9+Rigaud+hair+wig&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5iaocvEvQC&amp;sig=W4IVaSjfR0SkIVrAbDXcAChpdFs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q0O8VILiK4yhgwTygoHoCg&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&amp;q=Andr%C3%A9%20Rigaud%20hair%20wig&amp;f=false |title=From Sugar to Revolution: Women’s Visions of Haiti, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic |author= Chancy, Myriam J.A. |page=26 |accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The revolutionary==
After returning to Saint-Domingue from France, Rigaud became active in politics; he was a successor to [[Vincent Ogé]] and [[Julien Raimond]] as a champion of the interests of [[free people of color]] in [[Saint-Domingue]] (as [[French colonial empires|colonial]] [[Haïti]] was known).  Rigaud aligned himself with [[French Revolution|revolutionary]] [[France]] and with an interpretation of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen|Rights of Man]] that ensured the civil equality of all free people.

By the mid-1790s with slave uprisings in the North, Rigaud was leading an army, a force in the [[Ouest (department)|Ouest]] and [[Sud (department)|Sud]] departments.&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt; He was given authority to govern by [[Étienne Polverel]], one of the three French Civil Commissioners who had abolished slavery in Saint-Domingue in 1793.&lt;ref name="Corbett"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rigaud's power came from his influence with the mulatto planters, found mostly in the South.  They were fearful of the masses of former slaves; Rigaud's army also contained blacks and whites.{{sfnp|Rogozinski |1999 |pages=170-173}}

In the South and West, from 1793 to 1798, Rigaud helped defeat a [[United Kingdom|British]] invasion and re-establish the [[plantation economy]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Although Rigaud respected [[Toussaint Louverture]], the leading general of the former black slaves of the North, and his superior rank in the [[French Revolutionary Army]], he did not want to concede power in the South to him.&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt; Rigaud continued to believe in Saint-Domingue's race-based caste system which put mulattoes just below whites while leaving blacks at the bottom, a belief that put him at odds with Toussaint.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} This led to the bitter "[[War of Knives]]" (''La Guerre des Couteaux'') in June 1799, when Toussaint's army invaded Rigaud's territory.  [[Comte d'Hédouville]], sent by France to govern the island, encouraged Rigaud's rivalry with Toussaint. In 1800, Rigaud left Saint-Domingue for France after his defeat by  Toussaint Louverture.&lt;ref name="Corbett"/&gt;

==Leclerc expedition==
Rigaud returned to Saint-Domingue in 1802 with the expedition of General [[Charles Leclerc]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s brother-in-law.  He was sent to unseat Toussaint and re-establish French colonial rule and slavery in Saint-Domingue. After the [[First French Republic]] abolished slavery in the colony in 1794, following the first slave uprising, the colonial system based on exports of commodities from sugar cane and coffee plantations had been undermined. Sugar production fell markedly, and many surviving white and mulatto planters left the island as refugees. Many emigrated to the United States, where they settled in southern cities such as Charleston, or to the Spanish colonies of Cuba or New Orleans. LeClerc was initially successful, capturing and deporting Toussaint, but Toussaint's officers led the opposition by Haitian indigenous troops; they fought on for two more years. Defeated by disease as well as Haitian resistance, France withdrew its 7,000 surviving troops in November 1803; they were less than one-third of the forces that had been sent there.  Jean-Jacques Dessalines, a black from the North, led Saint-Domingue to victory and independence, declaring Haiti the new name of the nation. He ultimately declared himself emperor.

Rigaud returned to France after the failure of the expedition in 1802-1803. For a time he was held a prisoner in [[Fort de Joux]], the same fortress as his rival Toussaint, where the latter died in 1803.

==Final expedition==
Rigaud returned to Haiti a third time in December 1810. He established himself as ''President of the State of the [[Sud (department)|South]]'', in opposition to both [[Alexandre Pétion]], a [[mulatto]] and former ally in the South, and [[Henri Christophe]], a black who took power in the North. Shortly after Rigaud's death the following year, Pétion recovered power over the South. Rigaud's tomb is on a small hill between Camp-Perrin and Les Cayes, which is now split in half to make a new road to ease transport.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The '''Armed Forces of Equatorial Guinea''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Fuerzas Armadas de Guinea Ecuatorial'') consists of approximately 2,500 service members. The army has almost 1,400 soldiers, the police 400 paramilitary men, the navy 200 service members, and the air force about 120 members. There is also a [[Gendarmerie]], but the number of members is unknown. The Gendarmerie is a new branch of the service in which training and education is being supported by the French Military Cooperation in Equatorial Guinea.&lt;ref name="Equatorial Guinea"&gt;{{cite web |last = |first = |url= http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=30337:equatorial-guinea&amp;catid=119:african-militaries|title = Equatorial Guinea |work= |publisher= Flightglobal Insight |year=  |doi = |accessdate= 20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military appointments are all reviewed by President [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo|Teodoro Obiang]], and few of the native militiamen come from outside of Obiang's [[Mongomo]]-based Esangui clan. Obiang was a general when he overthrew his uncle, [[Francisco Macías Nguema]].

Overall the military is poorly trained and equipped. It has mostly small arms, [[rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]]s, and [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. Almost none of its [[Soviet armed forces|Soviet]]-style light-armored vehicles or trucks are operational.

The Armed Forces were reorganized in 1979. In 1988, the [[United States]] donated a 68-foot patrol boat to the [[Navy of Equatorial Guinea|Equatoguinean navy]] to patrol its exclusive economic zone. The U.S. patrol boat ''Isla de Bioko'' is no longer operational.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State, [https://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/equatorialguinea/26446.htm Equatorial Guinea Background Note 01/02]&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. military-to-military engagement has been dormant since 1997 (the year of the last [[Joint Combined Exchange Training]] exercise). Between 1984 and 1992, service members went regularly to the United States on the International Military Education Training program, after which funding for this program for [[Equatorial Guinea]] ceased. The government spent 6.5% of its annual budget on defense in 2000 and 4.5% of its budget on defense in 2001. It recently acquired some Chinese artillery pieces, some Ukrainian patrol boats, and some Ukrainian helicopter gunships. The number of paved airports in Equatorial Guinea can be counted on one hand, and as such the number of airplanes operated by the air force is small. The Equatoguineans rely on foreigners to operate and maintain this equipment as they are not sufficiently trained to do so. Cooper and Weinert 2010 says that all aircraft are based on the military side of [[Malabo International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper and Weinert 2010, p142&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a report said "The oil companies do not view Equatorial Guinea's military – a product of decades of brutal dictatorial rule – with much confidence. The army is believed to have only about 1,320 men under arms, the navy 120, and the air force 100. Seven of the army's nine generals are relatives of the president; the other two are from his tribe. There is no clear command structure, the level of discipline is low, and professionalism and training are almost non-existent, according to locals and foreign oil workers. Even the presidential guard – an indication of the lack of trust in the country's forces – is composed of 350 Moroccan troops."&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Dare, [http://projects.publicintegrity.org/bow/report.aspx?aid=151 The Curious Bonds of Oil Diplomacy], Center for Public Integrity, November 6, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; One general may be General Agustin Ndong Ona, reported in 2004.

In July 2010, after the visit of [[Brazil]]ian president, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], the sale of a [[Brazilian corvette Barroso (V34)|Barroso-class]] [[corvette]] to be constructed in Brazil was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alide.com.br/joomla/index.php/capa/75-extra/1419-lula-anuncia-venda-de-navio-da-classe-barroso-para-guine-equatorial|title=Lula anuncia venda de navio da classe Barroso para Guiné Equatorial|author=Felipe Salles|publisher=|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2016 the Zimbabwe Defence Forces deployed a training contingent to the Equatorial Guinea to train the country's military officers on operational and logistic matters following an urgent request by the West African country.  The security personnel contingent, is composed of members of the Zimbabwe National Army and Air Force of Zimbabwe.

== Navy ==
{{Main|Navy of Equatorial Guinea}}
As piracy and robbery at sea is a significant threat in the Gulf of Guinea, the country is investing heavily in its navy to protect its oil installations from these and other security challenges. In 2010 a Brazilian corvette was purchased, and renamed the 'Bata'. On 24 June 2014 the Frigate Wele Nzas was commissioned and became the flagship for the Navy of Equatorial Guinea.

The '''Augustinian Recollect Province of Saint Ezequiél Moreno''' is a division of the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects]] that has jurisdiction over the [[Philippines]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. It officially separated from the Province of [[Saint Nicholas de Tolentine]] on 28 November 1998. Today, the Provincialate House is located at the [[San Nicolas De Tolentino Parish Church (Quezon City)|San Nicolas De Tolentino Parish Church]] on Neptune Street, Congressional Subdivision, Project 6, [[Quezon City]].

==The arrival of the Recollects in the Philippines==
Though the province was only created in 1998, the Recollect Mission came to Philippine soils quite early in its history. Just 17 years after the Recollection was formed in the [[Chapter of Toledo]], 10 priests and 4 consecrated brothers sailed to the Philippines in order to heed the request of the Archbishop of Manila to help in the Christianization of the [[Philippines|islands]]. And with their arrival on 12 May 1606 at the island of [[Cebu]], they became the fifth [[Religious Order|order]] to be stalwarts of Philippine evangelization. Together with the [[Augustinian]]s (who arrived first in 1575), the discalced [[Franciscan]]s (1578), the [[Jesuit]]s (1581) and the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] (1587), they performed the heroic task of not only Christianizing the [[Philippines]] but also to lay the foundations of many of its modern-day towns and cities.

===The first Recoletos===
The first [[Recollect]] mission to the [[Philippines]] was led by no less than the very first [[Prior|Prior Provincial]] Fray Juan de San Jerónimo. Together with him was [[Priest|Fr.]] Rodrigo de San Miguel, a man well versed not only in [[theology]] but in other [[science]]s as well. Unfortunately, [[Priest|Fr.]] Andrés de San Nicolás did not make it to his destination but perished at sea.

===The first priories===
Though they first set foot on the island of [[Cebu]] in 1606, the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects|Recoletos]] built their first priory in the same year in Bagumbayan outside the walls of the present-day [[Intramuros]]. The house is still preserved by the national government until today, though it is in an uninhabitable state. The [[priory]] was dedicated to [[Saint John the Baptist]] and became one of the centers of devotion to Our Lady of Health for many years.

Three years later, they founded another house within the walls which became their Provincial House until the end of [[World War II]]. In 1616, they also founded a house in [[Cavite]] and went back to [[Cebu]] in 1621 to found yet another one. In the same year, they also began constructing the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects|order's]] most prominent sanctuary in history, the [[Minor Basilica of San Sebastian]].

==Missionary activities==

===Philippine missions===
In reality, the Recollection was not meant to be active. The Fifth Determination of the [[Chapter of Toledo]] was clear that the original motive of its creation was to be more contemplative.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Chapter of Toledo 5th Determination, ''''''Since there are among us, or at least may be, some who have greater love for monastic perfection and want to follow a more austere plan of life, we ought to favour their legitimate desire by not placing obstacles to the Holy Spirit; having previously consulted our most Reverend Father General and implored his leave, we determine that in our Province three or more monasteries of men and as many of women be designated or established; in them a more austere kind of life is to be practised; its manner is to be regulated, after mature reflection, by the Father Provincial with his Definitorum.''''''&lt;/ref&gt; Their main plan was to live more radically their life of prayer and community. Because of this, their original priories were not parishes but contemplative houses.

However, the difference in setting of the Philippines was so different that the missionaries in the [[Philippines]] needed to have a more active role. Filipinos flocked to their doors every Sunday to attend the [[Holy Mass]] and they had no choice but to open their doors. In 1607, they were officially given the charge to Christianize the towns of [[Bagac, Bataan|Bagac]], [[Bataan]]. They also founded in the same year a community in [[Masinloc]], [[Zambales]], which is considered their first real parish. And finally, at the end of the decade (1609), they also were made in charge of [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], Pangasinan.

On 1 March 1621, the colonial government divided the island of Mindanao into two. The northeastern section of the island was given to the [[Recollects]] while the rest was given to the [[Jesuits]]. Their most prominent area was in [[Butuan City]], [[Cateel, Davao Oriental]] and the [[Dinagat Islands]]. However, during the [[Jesuit Expulsion]], the task was left solely on their shoulders.

Perhaps, the province that carries the heaviest imprints of the [[Recollect]] mission is the island of Negros (now divided into [[Negros Occidental]] and [[Negros Oriental]]). Given to them in 1626, the [[Recollects]] not only founded parishes but also the very towns they have today. Today, most of the names of their towns bear the same names as those of [[Spain]], mainly those areas where the missionaries came from.

Other areas that were given to them were the islands of [[Romblon]], Banton and Tablas in 1635. [[Mindoro]] was added to their charge in 1679 and eight years later, the island of [[Masbate]]. Finally, they were also given some areas in the present-day [[Quezon Province]] in 1658.

In 1712, the Governor General Martin Ursua y Arizmendi, ordered the establishment of the towns along Pampanga - Pangasinan route to secure travelers from Aeta and Zambal raids. Incidentally, in the same year, the spiritual administration of the Zambales was restored to the Augustinian Recollects after a prolonged dispute with the Dominicans.  The Recollects opposed the governor’s order because of the inherent difficulty of its execution.  But the governor insisted. He even invoked the name of the King in his second request and order. The Recollects bowed in obedience. They sent the best devout missionaries to start the missions. Soon, the towns of Mabalacat and Panipoan or Bamban and Capas were established.

By 1898, the year that the Filipinos declared their freedom from Spain, the [[Recollects]] were attending to about 1,203,399 souls in 203 towns and 20 provinces in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Historia de la Iglesia en Hispanoamérica y Filipinas Vol. II (p.712), Isacio Rodríguez; Madrid 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign missions===
The [[Recollect]] missionaries in the Philippines did not content themselves with Christianizing the Philippines. They also embarked on an ambitious mission to other areas, most notably in [[Japan]]. Despite the scarcity of resources, they began an arduous mission to the said country 1623. The mission was begun by Spanish [[Priest|Fr.]] Francisco de Jesús and the Portuguese Fr. Vicente Carvalho and sowed the seeds of [[Christianity in Japan|Christianity]] in [[Unzen]], in the island of [[Kyushu]]. Their mission blessed the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects|order]] with its very first [[martyr]]s in Japan. The two [[priests]] were subjected to slow fire on 3 September 1623.

Their fate was repeated in the person of Fr. Melchor de San Agustín and Fr. Martín de San Nicolás in 1632. However, before the two died, they were able to give some [[catechism|catechetical instruction]] to a young girl named [[Magdalene of Nagasaki|Magdalene]] in the [[Prefecture of Nagasaki]]. She later became a member of the [[Secular Augustinian Recollect Fraternity|Tertiary]] and became the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects|order]]'s very first [[canonization|saint]].

Given that the Spanish dominions over the Pacific were under the management of the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines]], the province also sent missions to some of the islands of the Marianas.

Presently, the Philippine province is also in charge of the mission in [[Taiwan]] and [[Sierra Leone]].

==Other related organizations==

===Augustinian Recollect Sisters===
Founded by the [[Dionisia De Santa Maria Mitas Talangpaz|Dionisia Talangpaz]] and her sister [[Cecilia Rosa De Jesus Talangpaz|Cecilia Rosa]] on 16 July 1728, the [[Augustinian Recollect Sisters]] is the second oldest congregation in the [[Philippines]] after the [[Religious of the Virgin Mary]]. It also holds the honor of being the third oldest [[local church|congregation]] founded in [[Asia]].

It was originally an organization of [[Third order|Tertiaries]] but later on developed into a full congregation. The congregation is perpetually united to the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects]] in many ties. It is one of the active congregations belonging to the [[Augustinian Recollects]] family and a fruit brought forth out of the missionary zeal of the Order.

The primitive [[Augustinian Recollect]] Fathers guided the two foundresses and the first community of beatas. They directed the [[Beaterio de Terciarias Agustinas Recoletas|Beaterio]] from its earlier stage of growth and development until it was canonically erected as a diocesan [[Congregation (Catholic)#Group of Augustinian, Benedictine or Cistercian houses|religious congregation]] on 19 August 1929 through the recommendation of the [[priest|Reverend Father]] Gerardo Larrondo, the incumbent [[Prior|Prior General]] of the Recollect Friars; and through the benevolence of the [[Bishop|Most Reverend]] [[Michael J. O'Doherty|Michael O'Doherty]], then, [[Archbishop of Manila]].
 
Still with the nurturing assistance of the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects|Augustinian Recollect Order]], juridical autonomy was procured for the congregation which subsequently was declared an Institute of Pontifical Right by the [[Holy See]] on 20 November 1970, under the [[Pontiff|pontificate]] of [[Pope]] [[Paul VI]].

===The Secular Augustinian Recollect Fraternity===
The [[Secular Augustinian Recollect Fraternity]] is the [[Third Order]] or [[Tertiary]] of the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects]]. Founded as early as the 1650s in the town of [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]], [[Pangasinan]], these pious men and women share in the [[charism]] of the [[Augustinian Recollects|Recoletos]] in their daily lives.

In fact, the history of the [[Secular Augustinian Recollects]] is so fruitful in the province that it is from this province that the first [[martyr]] and [[saint]] of the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects|order]] came in the person of [[Magdalene of Nagasaki]].

Aside from this wondrous [[saint]], the [[Secular Augustinian Recollect]] was also blessed with other heroic people like Calara Calima and Isabel. In fact, the modern-day Augustinian Recollect Sisters were members of the [[Secular Augustinian Recollects|SARF]] during their earlier times.

Today, with more than 400 members scattered all over the archipelago, the [[Philippines]] [[Third order|Tertiaries]] are the second most numerous both in terms of nationality and provincial affinity.

===Recollect Augustinian Youth===
Considered the Fourth Order, this organization aims to form the modern youth with the spirituality of Saint Augustine. Recollect Augustinian Youth aims to pray for the saints, the religious men and women, and also the priest. They also preach about vocations and the true essence of St. Augustine and its works.

==OAR and education==
Aside from administering [[parish]]es, the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects|OAR]], in another good way to further help the Philippines, is to educate their people. Therefore, the [[Recollects]] began founding learning institutions as well. Scattered all over the country, these institutions are considered to be one of the centers of learning in their respective areas.

===Institutions with university status===

*[[University of Negros Occidental - Recoletos]] – fondly called as UNO-Recoletos or simply UNO-R, the school was founded in 1941 in [[Talisay City, Negros Occidental]], and later moved to its present location in [[Bacolod City]]. It is the first institution in the city and in the province. It was elevated to university status on May 15, 1957. Though not actually founded by the [[Recollects]], the management was transferred to them on May 25, 1962 with Fr. Federico Terradillos, OAR as its first [[Rector (academia)|rector]]. The school patron is [[Saint|San]] [[Nicolás de Tolentino]], the patron of souls in [[Purgatory]].
*[[University of San Jose - Recoletos]] – also known as USJ-R. Founded in 1947, it is one of [[Cebu]]'s centers of learning. It received university status on September 21, 1984 and by 2001, it was granted autonomy by the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]]. Also in 2003, it was granted Level 3 accreditation by the [[PAASCU]]. It has 3 campuses within the island of Cebu and the school patron is [[Ezequiel Moreno y Díaz|St. Ezekiel Moreno]].

===Institutions with college status===

*[[San Sebastian College - Recoletos de Manila]] – founded in 1941, it remains the only [[Recollect]] institution in [[Metro Manila]]. It also has a satellite campus in [[Canlubang]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]]. Baste, as it is fondly called by its students, is most popularly known because of its 5-year consecutive win in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|National Collegiate Athletic Association]]. It also remains as one of the main institutions of learning for law.
*[[San Sebastian College - Recoletos de Cavite]] – though bearing the [[San Sebastian College - Recoletos de Manila|same name]], the institution in [[Cavite City]] developed separately from that of Manila. Founded in 1966 as an all-male school, it opened its doors to accept women in 1986.

===Institutions offering secondary programs===

*[[Colegio de Santo Tomas - Recoletos]] – established in 1940 in [[San Carlos City, Negros Occidental|San Carlos City]], [[Negros Occidental]]

*San Pedro Academy - Recoletos – located at Barangay Caidiocan, [[Valencia, Negros Oriental|Valencia]], [[Negros Oriental]]
*San Pedro Academy - Recoletos – located at Barangay Poblacion, Valencia, Negros Oriental

==Early Life==

Ozdoev began wrestling for its courage, beauty and unexpected impressiveness. He decided to start training in Greco-Roman wrestling as his elder brother Khamzat and his neighbors were also engaged in the sport.  Ozdoev began wrestling under Askhab Belkharoev in the small village of [[Galashki]], [[Ingushetia]]. After several years, Ozdoev decided to move to [[Rostov-on-Don]] to continue with education and to train wrestling, becoming there a successful wrestler at cadet and junior level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sunja-edu.livejournal.com/6520.html|title=Наша гордость!

'''William MacArthur MacKenzie''' (27 March 1957 – 22 January 1997) was a Scottish singer, with a high tenor voice. He was a member of [[The Associates (band)|The Associates]].

==Biography==
MacKenzie was born and grew up in [[Dundee]]. As a youngster, he lived on Park Avenue in the [[Stobswell]] area of the city. He attended St Mary's Forebank Primary School and St Michael's Secondary School.  He led a [[nomadic|peripatetic]] lifestyle, decamping to [[New Zealand]] at the age of 16, and travelling across [[United States|America]] aged 17. Here he married Chloe Dummar, the sister-in-law of his Aunt Veronica. While MacKenzie was quoted as saying the marriage was made to stave off deportation so that he could sing with the New Orleans Gospel Choir – calling his wife a 'Dolly Parton type' – Dummar still believes the pair were in love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/news/tm_headline=billy-s-secret-wife-&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18467071&amp;siteid=64736-name_page.html |title=Latest Scotland, UK &amp; World News |work=The Daily Record|date= |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left her after three months of marriage and returned to Dundee, and the two never had contact again. Chloe Dummar filed for divorce in 1980, and MacKenzie did not contest the filing. Chloe's brother, [[Melvin Dummar]], claimed to be the "one sixteenth" beneficiary of the estate of [[Howard Hughes]], until the case was thrown out in 1978.

MacKenzie returned to Scotland where he met [[Alan Rankine]] and in 1976 formed the Ascorbic Ones.&lt;ref name="OBrien"&gt;O'Brien, Lucy (1997) "Those Last Impressions: Billy MacKenzie", ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''&lt;/ref&gt; They changed the name to Mental Torture and finally [[Associates (band)|Associates]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="OBrien" /&gt; Rankine left Associates in 1982, but MacKenzie continued to work under the name for several years until he began releasing material under his own name in the 1990s. Mackenzie also collaborated with many other artists during his career. In 1987, he wrote lyrics for two tracks on [[Yello]]'s album ''[[One Second (Yello album)|One Second]]'': "Moon on Ice", which he sang himself, and "The Rhythm Divine", which was sung by [[Shirley Bassey]] and was released as a single. A version sung by MacKenzie was released on the tape and CD versions of Associates' ''Popera'' compilation). MacKenzie also collaborated with [[B.E.F. (British Electric Foundation)]] for their two albums ''Music of Quality and Distinction'' Volume I (1982) &amp; Volume II (1991).

On 22 January 1997, depression and the death of his mother are believed to have contributed to Mackenzie's suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/live_reviews/article1599059.ece|title=Billy Mackenzie Tribute|last=Dalton|first=Stephen|work=The Times| date=2 April 2007|accessdate=3 June 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author= | url=http://sport.scotsman.com/modernchristians/Dead-rockers-and-our-inner.2295236.jp | title=Dead rockers and our inner ghouls | work=The Scotsman |date=18 January 2002 |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He overdosed on a combination of [[paracetamol]] and prescription medication in the garden shed of his father's house in [[Auchterhouse]]. He was 39 years old.

== Dedications ==

He was the subject of a biography by Tom Doyle, ''The Glamour Chase'', in 1998.

[[Siouxsie Sioux]] wrote the song "[[Say (The Creatures song)|Say]]", revealing in the lyrics that they were going to meet just before his death.

For her ''[[Medúlla]]'' album, [[Björk]] considered singing a beyond the grave duet with Mackenzie using recordings given to her by his father, but eventually decided against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Alexis Petridis |url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/rock/story/0,,2066050,00.html |title='If you're brave, do it like we did' |work=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:″I checked my face in the mirror, opened the book about Billy Mackenzie.
:
:One day at Billy′s house his dad brought in a cake and Billy said, 'That cake is like your aunty's hat.'
:
:'That image kept replaying in my mind, another memory of something I didn't witness, as James came out of the bathroom.
:
:'What are you reading?' he asked.
:
:'A book,' I said, flicking to the end where Billy kills himself and goes to sleep for ever in the dog basket.″

Morin said in an interview: "I was devastated by his death which is odd because I didn’t know him. My husband did. Mackenzie’s death affected me in a way that [[Ian Curtis]]'s didn’t. Curtis seemed born to die. Mackenzie should have outgrown his gloom and become an eccentric old man. I think our work is similar. It’s the duality of glamour and spirituality in his voice that attracts me. His toughness and fragility; darkness and laughter. He could be a character from one of my books. I always meant to send him a copy of Dead Glamorous." &lt;ref name="Trivial and profound: an interview with Carole Morin"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2013 | url = http://carolemorin.co.uk/interview/ | title = Trivial and profound: an interview with Carole Morin | publisher = Dragon Ink Books | accessdate = 19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Ground squirrels and snakes===
His primary animal system for investigating animal behavior, social behavior and communication, and antipredator and counter-antipredator behavior was [[California ground squirrel]]s and snakes (especially [[rattlesnakes]]). Adult California ground squirrels must defend against avian and mammalian predators.  They also must defend their pups especially from predation by rattlesnakes and [[gopher snake]]s. Owings together with his students and colleagues discovered a number of behavioral and physiological defense [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] against snakes. When ground squirrels encounter a predator, their first response is to typically vocalize in distinctly different ways to aerial and ground predators.  Encounters with snakes may elicit ground predator vocalization, but ground squirrels then shift to visual signaling by tail flagging.&lt;ref name =OC&gt;
{{vcite journal |
author= Owings, D. H.,  Coss, R. G | title=Snake mobbing by California ground squirrels: adaptive variation and ontogeny | journal=Behaviour | date= 1977 | volume= 62 | pages= 50–69 | | doi=10.1163/156853977x00045}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Tail flagging has the advantage of harassing snakes and deterring them from entering burrows with squirrel pups, but it has the disadvantage of requiring close proximity to snakes increasing the likelihood of snake bites.  In response to this problem, ground squirrels have evolved the capacity to neutralize rattlesnake venom.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|last=Goudarzi|first=Sara|title=Squirrels Use "Snake Perfume" to Fool Predators|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/12/071221-squirrels-snakes.html|accessdate=7 February 2013|newspaper=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holder|first=Kathleen|title=Feisty squirrels hold clues to treatment for rattlesnake bites|url=http://dateline.ucdavis.edu/101300/DL_squirrels.html|publisher=Dateline, UC Davis|accessdate=7 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204050440/http://dateline.ucdavis.edu/101300/DL_squirrels.html|archivedate=4 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first=Scott|title=Squirrels Defend Against Rattlesnakes|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=17869365|publisher=NPR|accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rattlesnakes have evolved specialized sensory organs ([[Infrared sensing in snakes|infrared-sensitive pit organs]]) that enhance their ability to predate small mammals. This ability to sense in the infrared set the stage for ground squirrels to evolve antipredator counter-innovations that take advantage of the specialized sensory organs of rattlesnakes.  Owings and colleagues found that ground squirrels shunt blood to their tails when encountering rattlesnakes. This allows ground squirrels to tail flag to rattlesnakes even in the dark with their hot tails that rattlesnakes can detect with infrared-sensitive pit organs. Ground squirrels do not shunt blood to their tails when they encounter gopher snakes, which also feed on their young, but lack infrared-sensitive pit organs.&lt;ref name = Rundus&gt;

===Assessment/management communication===
His research on predator-prey interactions between ground squirrels and rattlesnakes led to the formulation of a new theoretical perspective on communication called ''assessment/management'' view of communication.  From this perspective, communication is dependent on the sensory and action systems of the individuals engaged in communication.  Information is not sent or received by individuals but rather it is extracted from what others are doing and their context (i.e., [[James J. Gibson|Gibsonian]] [[affordance]]s). The extracted information is then assessed and acted upon. What affordances an individual extracts and assesses depend on its sensory systems and, more generally, on the nature of its [[umwelt]] (i.e., an animal's sensory-actions systems).  Because communication requires the extraction of information from affordances presented to individuals, this creates the opportunity to manipulate or manage the behavior of others by controlling the affordances they perceive.  For example, ground squirrels have evolved the ability to shunt blood to their tails, which heats their tails up.  They can then tail-flag at rattlesnakes, which can perceive their hot tails in the infrared.&lt;ref name = Rundus/&gt; Communication is thus an inter-individual process of extracting and assessing information from affordances and actively managing the affordances perceived by others and thereby managing their behavior.  In this view, communication is self-interested behavior, shaped by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name=book&gt;

The assessment/management view of communication is very general, allowing for both intra- and inter-species communication. It can also be extended to human communication to encompass a broader understanding of human communication during early development.  The first form of human communication occurs via [[Infant|human infant]] crying.  Human infants are helpless and their sensory-action systems are severely limited when compared to the sensory-action systems of their caregivers.  They are very limited in assessing their own needs much less managing them.  Caregivers can assess and manage the needs of infants, but they lack direct access to emotional needs of infants (e.g., hunger, pain).  Human infant crying is highly salient and normally activates the assessment and management systems of caregivers directing them to crying infants.  When successful, caregivers assess the needs of crying infants and act in ways that reduce these needs (e.g., feeding a hungry infant).  The noxiousness of crying may be a factor some cases of child abuse.&lt;ref name=cry/&gt;

The assessment/management approach is predictive of malfunctions in infant-caregiver communication.  For example, [[Baby colic|colic]] is common in technologically developed western countries, and may be the result of the decreased proximity between caregiver and infant.  The decreased proximity can result in delayed responses by caregivers to crying infants resulting in infants escalating crying with the subsequent development long bouts crying that do not stop when a caregivers attempts to manage distressed infants.&lt;ref name=cry/&gt;

===Robosquirrel===
The [[robosquirrel]] project stems directly from Owings' long-term research on the interactions of ground squirrels and rattlesnakes together with his assessment/management view of communication.&lt;ref name = Rundus/&gt;&lt;ref name = IEEE/&gt; Robosquirrel was developed to test implication of the assessment/management approach by developing robotic squirrels that could allow researchers to precisely control what affordances (e.g. tail wagging and tail heating) are presented to rattlesnakes for assessment and how these affordances can manage rattlesnake behavior.&lt;ref name = IEEE/&gt;

'''Edy Campagnoli''' (12 June 1934 – 6 February 1995) was an Italian television personality and actress.

== Life and career ==
Born '''Edda Campagnoli'''  in [[Milan]], she started her career as a [[runway model]] after [[World War II]]. In 1954 she played Venus in the opera ''La Vestale'' by [[Luchino Visconti]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news|last=Anna Bandettini|title=Addio Edy la madre di tutte le vallette|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1995/02/07/addio-edy-la-madre-di-tutte-le.html?ref=search|accessdate=11 May 2014|newspaper=[[La Repubblica]]|date=1995-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=corr&gt;{{cite news|title=Addio Edy Campagnoli, dolce valletta "muta"|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1995/febbraio/07/Addio_Edy_Campagnoli_dolce_valletta_co_0_9502078186.shtml|accessdate=11 May 2014|newspaper=[[Corriere della Sera]]|date=1995-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Campagnoli made her television debut in the program ''Vetrine'', then, noticed by a [[RAI]] manager, in 1955 she was chosen as the assistant of [[Mike Bongiorno]] in the popular quiz show ''[[Lascia o raddoppia?]]''.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=corr/&gt; In spite of the controversities surrounding her ornamental role, for which she was nicknamed "la valletta muta" (i.e. "the mute valet"),&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=corr/&gt; Campagnoli achieved a large popularity, as to be referred as "the most famous woman in Italy".&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; 

After abandoning the quiz show in 1959, Campagnoli appeared in a number of other television programs, then she left the showbusiness in mid-1960s to pursue a career as a fashion businesswoman.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; She died at 60 years old for the consequences of a stroke.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;&lt;ref name=corr/&gt; She had been married to Italian football goalkeeper [[Lorenzo Buffon]] for a time, although they later divorced.

The '''flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland''' was the largest of a series of [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|flights and expulsions of Germans in Europe during and after World War II]]. [[German minority in Poland|The German population]] fled or was expelled from all regions which are [[Territorial changes of Poland after World War II|currently within the territorial boundaries]] of Poland, including the [[former eastern territories of Germany]] and parts of [[Second Polish Republic|pre-war Poland]].

==Background==

===Historical background===
{{Main|History of German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe|Nazi Germany|World War II|The Holocaust|Expulsion of Poles by Germany|Untermensch|Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles|History of the Germans in Poland}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J09397, Lodz, Millionster Umsiedler im Wartheland.jpg|300px|thumb| Nazi official [[Arthur Greiser]] welcoming millionth German colonist in occupied Poland - March 1944.]]

German settlement in the [[former eastern territories of Germany]] and [[Second Polish Republic|pre-war Poland]] dates back to the medieval [[Ostsiedlung]]. [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] used the presence and the alleged persecution of [[Volksdeutsche]] as propaganda tools in preparation for the [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939. With the invasion, Poland was partitioned between [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] according to the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. This was followed by population exchanges, and included [[Baltic Germans]] who were settled to occupied Poland.

Germany's [[Generalplan Ost]] strategy for Central and Eastern Europe envisioned the creation of a [[German question#Later influence|Greater Germany]], which was to be built by means of removing a variety of non-Germans from Poland and other areas in Central and Eastern Europe, mainly [[Slavs]] and [[Jews]] believed by Nazis to be [[Untermensch|subhuman]]. These non-Germans were targeted for [[Ost-Arbeiter|slave labor]] and eventual [[The Holocaust|extermination]]. While Generalplan Ost's settlement ambitions did not come into full effect due to the war's turn, millions of Germans mostly from Central and Eastern Europe were settled by the Nazis to replace Poles removed or killed during the occupation. Germany deported millions of Poles either to other territories, to concentration camps or as slave workers. Many others were deported by the Soviet Union during the years 1939-1941, when [[Germany–Soviet Union relations before 1941|Germany and Soviet Union cooperated against Poles]].

German communities living within the pre-war borders of Poland participated in wartime German activities, starting with the invasion of Poland.&lt;ref name="Wojciech Roszkowski page 171"&gt;Wojciech Roszkowski&lt;blockquote&gt; "Historia Polski 1914-1997" Warsaw 1998 PWNW page 171&lt;/ref&gt; Created on order of Reichsführer-SS [[Heinrich Himmler]], a Nazi [[ethnic German]] organisation called [[Selbstschutz]] carried out mass murder during ''[[Intelligenzaktion]]'' alongside operational groups of German military and police. In addition, the German minority engaged in such activities as identifying Poles for execution and illegally detaining them.&lt;ref name="Wardzyńska"/&gt; To Poles, moving Germans out of Poland was seen as an attempt to avoid such events in the future and, as a result, the Polish government in exile proposed a population transfer of Germans as early as 1941.&lt;ref name="Wardzyńska"&gt;''"Polacy - wysiedleni, wypędzeni i wyrugowani przez III Rzeszę"'', Maria Wardzyńska, Warsaw 2004".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vertreibungsgebiet.jpg|thumb|250px|Allied map used to determine the number of Germans that would have to be expelled from the eastern German territories using different border scenarios (based on German pre-war census)]]

Representatives of the [[Polish government-in-exile|Polish Government]] were not present at any of those conference and felt [[western betrayal|betrayed by their western Allies]] who decided about future Polish borders behind their backs.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J28759, Ostdeutschland, deutsche Soldaten auf Feld.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Retreating [[Wehrmacht]], [[former eastern territories of Germany|eastern Germany]], March 1945]]

Following the [[Tehran Conference]] (November–December 1943) [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Winston Churchill]] made it clear that the Soviets would keep the Polish territories east of the [[Curzon Line]] and offered Poland territorial compensation in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Rehbein, Die westdeutsche Oder/Neisse-Debatte: Hintergründe, Prozess und Ende des Bonner Tabus, LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2005, p.11, {{ISBN|3-8258-9340-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final decision to move Poland's boundary westward, preconditioning the expulsion of Germans, was made by Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States at the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945, when the Curzon line was irrevocably fixed as the future Polish-Soviet border.&lt;ref name="Gibney198"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Rehbein, Die westdeutsche Oder/Neisse-Debatte: Hintergründe, Prozess und Ende des Bonner Tabus, LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2005, p.17, {{ISBN|3-8258-9340-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise location of the Polish western border was left open and, though basically the Allies had agreed on population transfers, the extent remained questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred M. De Zayas, ''Nemesis at Potsdam'', p.85&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning the post-war western frontier of Poland, the agreement simply read: "''If a specific problem such as the frontiers of liberated Poland and the complexion of its government allowed no easy solution, hopes were held out for the future discussion of all outstanding problems in an amicable manner.''"&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Rehbein, Die westdeutsche Oder/Neisse-Debatte: Hintergründe, Prozess und Ende des Bonner Tabus, LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2005, p.18, {{ISBN|3-8258-9340-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon gaining control of these lands, the Soviet and Polish-Communist authorities started to expel the German population.&lt;ref name="Philipp Ther 1998, p.56"&gt;Philipp Ther, ''Deutsche Und Polnische Vertriebene: Gesellschaft und Vertriebenenpolitik in SBZ/ddr und in Polen 1945–1956'', 1998, p.56, {{ISBN|3-525-35790-7}}, {{ISBN|978-3-525-35790-3}}: From June until mid July, Polish military and militia expelled nearly all people from the districts immediately east of the rivers [Oder-Neisse line]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1945, at the [[Potsdam Conference]], the Allies placed most [[former eastern territories of Germany]] east of the Oder–Neisse line under Polish administration. Article XIII concerning the transfer of Germans was adopted at the [[Potsdam Conference]] in July 1945. It was an emergency measure, drafted and adopted in great haste, a response to the wild expulsions of Germans from Czechoslovakia and Poland, which had created a chaotic situation in the American and British zones of occupation. The [[Soviet Union]] transferred territories to the east of the Oder–Neisse line to Poland in July 1945. Subsequently, most of the remaining Germans were expelled to the territories west of the line.

President [[Harry S. Truman]] complained that there were now five occupation zones because the Soviets had turned over the area extending along the Oder and western Neisse to Poland and was concerned about Germany's economic control and war reparations.&lt;ref&gt;Gormly, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill spoke against giving Poland control over an area in which some eight million Germans lived. Stalin insisted that the Germans had all fled and that the Poles were needed to fill the vacuum.&lt;ref name=gormly50&gt;Gormly, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; On July 24, the Polish communist delegation arrived in Berlin, insisting on the Oder and western Neisse rivers as the frontier, and they vehemently argued their case before the foreign ministers, Churchill, and Truman, in turn.&lt;ref name=gormly50 /&gt; The next day Churchill warned Stalin: "The Poles are driving the Germans out of the Russian zone. That should not be done without considering its effect on the food supply and reparations. We are getting into a position where the Poles have food and coal, and we have the mass of (the) population thrown at us."&lt;ref&gt;Gormly, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; To the Soviets, reparations were more important than boundaries, and Stalin might have given up on the Poles if they had not so vociferously protested when, in spite of his 'illness', he consulted with them during the evening of July 29.&lt;ref&gt;Gormly: p.55f&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polish attitudes===
With German communities living within the pre-war borders of Poland, there was an expressed fear of disloyalty of Germans in [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920–39)|Eastern Upper Silesia]] and [[Pomerelia]], based on wartime German activities.&lt;ref name="Wojciech Roszkowski page 171"/&gt; As Germany invaded Poland, the German minority engaged in mass murder, rapes and plunder of Polish citizens, in addition to making lists of people that were to be sent to German concentration camps.&lt;ref name="Wardzyńska"/&gt; Poles wanted to avoid such events in the future and as a result, Polish exile authorities proposed a population transfer of Germans as early as 1941.&lt;ref name="Wardzyńska"/&gt;

[[File:Wladyslaw Gomulka.jpg|thumb|200px|Władysław Gomułka organized transport of Germans to occupied Germany in Ministry for the [[Recovered Territories]]]]

In 1941, [[Władysław Sikorski]] of the [[Polish government-in-exile]] insisted on driving "the German horde (...) back far [westward]",&lt;ref&gt;Norman M. Naimark, ''Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe'', Harvard University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-674-00994-0}}, p.123&lt;/ref&gt; while in 1942 memoranda he expressed concern about Poland acquiring [[Lower Silesia]], populated with "fanatically anti-Polish Germans".&lt;ref&gt;Viktoria Vierheller, ''"Polen und die Deutschland Frage 1939-1949"'', Köln 1970, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norman M. Naimark p.123"&gt;Norman M. Naimark, ''Fires of Hatred'', p.123&lt;/ref&gt; Yet as the war went on, Lower Silesia also became a Polish war aim, as well as occupation of the Baltic coast west of [[Szczecin]] as far as [[Rostock]] and occupation of the [[Kiel Canal]].&lt;ref name="Norman M. Naimark p.123"/&gt; Expulsions of Germans from [[East Prussia]] and pre-war Poland had become a war aim as early as in February 1940, expressed by Polish Foreign Minister [[August Zaleski]].&lt;ref name="Norman M. Naimark p.123"/&gt;

After Sikorski's death, the next Polish Prime Minister [[Stanisław Mikołajczyk]] in a letter to Roosevelt expressed his concerns about the idea of compensating Poland in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Stanisław Mikołajczyk, ''"The pattern of Soviet Domination"'', London 1948, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; However, pressed by Churchill, he was forced to accept the Tehran decision, which was the direct cause of his resignation from his post.&lt;ref name=Urban114&gt;Thomas Urban, ''"Der Verlust ..."'', p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;
The next Polish Prime Minister, [[Tomasz Arciszewski]] claimed that Poland did not "want neither Breslau nor Stettin".&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Times, December 17, 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Polish government-in-exile was recognised by the Allies at that time, the [[Soviet Union]] broke off all diplomatic relations with it in April 1943 after Polish government demanded the investigation of the [[Katyn massacre]]. On April 20, 1944, in Moscow, the Soviet sponsored Polish Communist cell founded the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (PKWN) on Stalin's initiative. Just one week later the representatives of the PKWN and the Soviet Union signed a treaty regulating the new Polish-Soviet border. A year later, before the [[Potsdam Conference]], the western Allies followed Stalin, recognized the Soviet-sponsored government, which accepted the shift of the borders westwards, and withdrew their recognition for the Polish government-in-exile. Poles were classified as sub-humans (untermenschen) by the Nazis, with their ultimate fate being slavery and extermination, while Germans occupied position of privileged "ubermenschen" that were to rule over Poles and other nations; when [[Stanisław Mikołajczyk]] joined the "Government of National Unity" as a deputy prime minister in 1945, he justified the expulsions of Germans by national terms following communist [[Władysław Gomułka]], but also as a revolutionary act, freeing the Poles of exploitation by a German middle and upper class.&lt;ref name="Norman M. Naimark p.124"&gt;Norman M. Naimark, ''Fires of Hatred'', p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

In general the Polish historiography views the expulsion of Germans as justified and correct, even when describing it as a "lesser evil".&lt;ref&gt;Przyłączenie Śląska Opolskiego do Polski (1945-1948), Instytut Studiów Politycznych PAN, Warszawa 1996

Many refugees tried to return home when the fighting in their homelands ended.

===Deportation to the Soviet Union===
{{Main|Forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union}}

On February 6, 1945, Soviet [[NKVD]] ordered [[mobilisation]] of all German men (17 to 50 years old) in the Soviet-controlled territories. Many of them were then transported to the Soviet Union for [[forced labour]]. In the former German territories the Soviet authorities did not always distinguish between the Poles and Germans and often treated them alike.&lt;ref name="Jankowiak"&gt;p. 35 - {{cite book | last = Jankowiak | first = Stanisław | title = "Wysiedlenie i emigracja ludności niemieckiej w polityce władz polskich w latach 1945-1970" (Expulsion and emigration of German population in the policies of Polish authorities in 1945-1970) | location = Warszawa | year = 2005 | publisher = [[Instytut Pamięci Narodowej]] | isbn = 83-89078-80-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; German civilians were also held as "reparations labor"  by the USSR.

Ethnic German citizens from pre-war Poland, who collaborated with the German occupiers, were considered "traitors of the nation" and sentenced to forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;Spieler, Silke. ed.

Page 40&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish historians [[:Pl:Witold Sienkiewicz (historyk)|Witold Sienkiewicz]] and [[:Pl:Grzegorz Hryciuk|Grzegorz Hryciuk]] maintain that the internment '' "resulted in numerous deaths, which cannot be accurately determined because of lack of statistics or falsification . Periodically, they could be 10% of inmates. Those interned are estimated at 200-250,000 Germans and the local population, and deaths might range from 15,000 to 60,000 persons."

Woźniczka apparently made his estimate of a 20-50% death rate based on the 1974 [[German Federal Archives]] report&lt;/ref&gt;

Zayas states that "in many internment camps no relief from outside was permitted. In some camps relatives would bring packages and deliver them to the Polish guards, who regularly plundered the contents and delivered only the remains, if any.  Frequently, these relatives were so ill-treated that they never returned. Internees who came to claim their packages were also mistreated by the guards, who insisted the internees should speak Polish, even if they were Germans born in German-speaking Silesia or Pomerania."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred M. de Zayas, Nemesis at Potsdam, Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London 1977 {{ISBN|0-7100-8468-4}} pp. 124ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the interned were also German [[POW]]s. Up to 10% of the 700,000 to 800,000 POWs of the respective battlegrounds were handed over to the Poles by the Soviet military for the use of their work force.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred Gebhardt, Joachim Küttner, Dieter Bingen, ''Deutsche in Polen nach 1945: Gefangene und Fremde'', 1997, p.23, {{ISBN|3-486-56236-3}}, {{ISBN|978-3-486-56236-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; POW labor was employed on the reconstruction of Warsaw and revival of industrial, agricultural and other productive enterprises&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Kochanowski.In Polnischer Gefangenschaft: Deutsche Kriegsgefangene in Polen 1945-1950.

===Pre-Potsdam "wild" expulsions (May – July 1945)===
[[File:Fotothek df pk 0000126 029 Flüchtlinge mit Handwagen.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Refugees trail, eastern Germany 1945.]]
[[File:Polskie obwieszczenie 1945.jpg|thumb|left|215px|"Special order" to the German population of [[Bad Salzbrunn]] (Szczawno-Zdrój). Issued by Polish authorities on 14 July 1945, 6 a.m., to be executed until 10 a.m.]]
In 1945, the [[former eastern territories of Germany|territories east of the Oder-Neisse line]] ([[Silesia]], most of [[Pomerania]], [[East Brandenburg]] and [[East Prussia]]) were [[Military occupation|occupied]] by Soviet and Soviet-controlled Polish military forces. Polish militia and military started expulsions&lt;ref name="Philipp Ther 1998, p.56"/&gt; before the Potsdam Conference, referred to as "wild expulsions" ({{lang-de|Wilde Vertreibungen|links=no}}), affecting between 700,000 and 800,000 Germans.&lt;ref name=Kacowicz100101/&gt; The Polish communists ordered the expulsion of Germans: "We must expel all the Germans because countries are built on national lines and not on multi-national ones" was demanded by participants of a Plenum of the Central Committee of the Polish Workers Party on May 20–21, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Naimark, ''The Russians ...'', p. 75 reference 31&lt;/ref&gt; On the same Plenum, the head of the Central Committee, [[Władysław Gomułka]], ordered: "There has to be a border patrol at the border [Oder-Neisse line] and the Germans have to be driven out. The main objective has to be the cleansing of the terrain of Germans, the building of a nation state".&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Ther, ''Deutsche Und Polnische Vertriebene: Gesellschaft und Vertriebenenpolitik in SBZ/ddr und in Polen 1945–1956'', 1998, p. 56, {{ISBN|3-525-35790-7}}, {{ISBN|978-3-525-35790-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure the [[Oder–Neisse line]] would be accepted as the new Polish border at a future Allied Conference ([[Potsdam Conference]]), up to 300,000 Germans living close to the rivers' eastern bank were expelled subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Ther, ''Deutsche Und Polnische Vertriebene: Gesellschaft und Vertriebenenpolitik in SBZ/ddr und in Polen 1945-1956'', 1998, p. 57, {{ISBN|3-525-35790-7}}, {{ISBN|978-3-525-35790-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 26, 1945, the Central Committee ordered all Germans to be expelled within one year and the area settled with some 3.5 million ethnic Poles; 2.5 million of them were already re-settled by summer.&lt;ref&gt;Ulf Brunnbauer, Michael G. Esch, Holm Sundhaussen, ''Definitionsmacht, Utopie, Vergeltung: "ethnische Säuberungen" im östlichen Europa des 20. Jahrhunderts'', 2006, p.85, {{ISBN|3-8258-8033-8}}, {{ISBN|978-3-8258-8033-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germans were defined as either [[Reichsdeutsche]] or [[Volksdeutsche]] resembling the 1st or 2nd category in the Nazis' [[Volksliste]], people who had signed a lower category were allowed to apply for "verification", that was to determine whether they would be granted Polish citizenship as "autochtones".&lt;ref name="Norman M. Naimark p.130"/&gt;

Before June 1, 1945, some 400,000 Germans managed to cross the Oder and Neisse rivers eastward before Polish authorities closed the river crossings, another 800,000 entered Silesia from Czechoslovakia, bringing up Silesia's population to 50% of the pre-war level.&lt;ref&gt;Ulf Brunnbauer, Michael G. Esch, Holm Sundhaussen, ''Definitionsmacht, Utopie, Vergeltung'', p.85, 2006, {{ISBN|3-8258-8033-8}}, {{ISBN|978-3-8258-8033-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the odd situation of treks of Germans moving about in all directions, to the east as well as to the west, each warning the others of what would await them at their destination&lt;ref name="Norman M. Naimark p.124"/&gt;

==Expulsions following the Potsdam Conference==
[[File:OderNeisselineatSwinemünde.JPG|thumb|150px|[[Oder-Neisse line]] at [[Usedom]]]]

After the [[Potsdam Conference]], Poland was officially in charge of the territories east of the [[Oder–Neisse line]]. Despite the fact that article 8 of Potsdam agreement from August 2, 1945 stated that "population transfer" should be performed in ordered and humane manner, and should not commence until after the creation of an expulsion plan approved by the Allied Control Council, the expulsions continued without rules and were associated with many criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers Lexicon Online. [http://lexikon.meyers.de/meyers/Vertreibung Vertreibung].&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Polish administration had set up a [[State Repatriation Office]] (''Państwowy Urząd Repatriacyjny, PUR''), the bureau and its administrative subunits proved ineffective due to quarrels between Communists and opposition and a lack of equipment for the giant task of expelling Germans and resettling Poles in an area devastated by war.&lt;ref name="Philipp Ther p.60"&gt;Philipp Ther, ''Deutsche Und Polnische Vertriebene'', p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, rivalry occurred between the Soviet occupation forces and the newly installed Polish administration, a phenomenon dubbed ''dwuwladza'' (double administration).&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Ther, ''Deutsche Und Polnische Vertriebene'', p.59&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets kept trains and German workmen regardless of the Polish ambitions and plans.&lt;ref name="Philipp Ther p.60"/&gt;

The waves of expulsions after the Potsdam conference must also be seen in the context of the contemporary, likewise unorganized, resettling of displaced or homeless Poles. Polish settlers, [[Polish population transfers (1944–46)|who themselves had been expelled from areas east]] of the [[Curzon Line]], arrived with about nothing, putting an even higher pressure on the remaining Germans to leave.&lt;ref name="Norman M. Naimark p.128"&gt;Norman M. Naimark, ''Fires of Hatred'', p.128&lt;/ref&gt; For the Germans, the Potsdam Agreement eased conditions only in one way - because now the Poles were more confident in keeping the [[former eastern territories of Germany]], the expulsions were performed with less haste, which meant the Germans were duly informed about their expulsions earlier and were allowed to carry some luggage.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Ther, ''Deutsche Und Polnische Vertriebene'', p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem the Germans and, to a lesser extent, even the newly arrived Poles were facing was an enormous crime wave, most notably theft and [[war rape|rape]], committed by gangs not only consisting of regular criminals but also Soviet soldiers, deserters or former forced laborers ([[Ost-Arbeiter]]), coming back from the west.&lt;ref name="Ther61"&gt;Philipp Ther, ''Deutsche und polnische Vertriebene'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Upper Silesia]], a party official,{{Who|date=March 2011}} complained about some Polish security forces and militia raping and pillaging the German population and a general loss of sense for right and wrong.&lt;ref name="Norman M. Naimark p.128"/&gt; Much abuse also came from [[Northern Group of Forces|large Soviet contingents stationed in Poland after the war]]. A high number of crimes committed by regular Soviet soldiers - on both Germans and Poles - had been reported (see [[Rape during the liberation of Poland]]). A high death toll among the few Polish officials who dared to investigate these cases followed.&lt;ref name="Ther59"&gt;Philipp Ther, ''Deutsche Und Polnische Vertriebene'', p.59/60&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, Soviet troops played an ambiguous role, as there are also cases where Soviets freed local Germans imprisoned by Poles, or delayed expulsions to keep German workforce, for example on farms providing Soviet troops (for instance in [[Słupsk]]).&lt;ref name="Ulf Brunnbauer p.85"&gt;Ulf Brunnbauer, Michael G. Esch, Holm Sundhaussen, Definitionsmacht, Utopie, Vergeltung: "ethnische Säuberungen" im östlichen Europa des 20.

The damaged infrastructure and quarrels between the Allied authorities in the occupation zones of Germany and the Polish administration caused long delays in the transport of expellees, who were first ordered to gather at one of the various PUR transportation centers or internment camps and then often forced to wait in ill-equipped barracks, exposed both to criminals, aggressive guards and the cold and not supplied sufficiently with food due to the overall shortages.&lt;ref name="Philipp Ther p.60"/&gt; The "organized transfer" as agreed at the Potsdam Conference began in early 1946. Conditions for expellees improved, yet due to the lack of heating facilities, the cold winters of both 1945/46 and 1946/47 continued to claim many lives.&lt;ref name="Norman M.

The verification procedure varied in different territories and was changed several times. Initially, the applicants had to prove their past membership in a Polish minority organization of the [[German Reich]], and in addition needed a warrant where three Polish locals testified their Polishness.&lt;ref name=Ther305&gt;Philipp Ther, Deutsche und polnische Vertriebene: Gesellschaft und Vertriebenenpolitik in SBZ/DDR und in Polen 1945-1956, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1998, p.305, {{ISBN|3-525-35790-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1945, the [[Upper Silesia]]n voivode declared the fulfillment of only one of these requirements to be sufficient.&lt;ref name=Ther305/&gt; In the areas like [[Lower Silesia]] and [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|province of Pomerania]], where the Polish authorities suspected only Germans, verification was handled much more strictly than in the former German-Polish borderlands&lt;ref name="Ther305"/&gt; In Masuria a Polish last name or a Polish-speaking ancestor was sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNV5uIIKJjkC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=autochthons+poland&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0qoeTuqhJszHsgb4k4X2AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=autochton&amp;f=false

The word "autochton", introduced by the Polish government in 1945 for propaganda purposes,&lt;ref name=Thum/&gt; is today sometimes considered an offensive remark and direct naming as Kashubians, Silesians and Masurians is preferred to avoid offending the people described.&lt;ref&gt;Przyłączenie Śląska Opolskiego do Polski (1945-1948), Instytut Studiów Politycznych PAN, Warszawa 1996 Prof. dr hab.

==Rehabilitation of Volksdeutsche==
During the war the population of the annexed areas of Poland was classified by the Nazis in different categories according to their "Germanness" in the [[Deutsche Volksliste]]. While most of the [[Volksdeutsche]] population of [[Second Polish Republic|pre-war Poland]] fled or was expelled, some were rehabilitated and offered their pre-war Polish citizenship back.&lt;ref name=cordell7980/&gt; While those who had signed ''Volksliste'' category "I" were expelled, rehabilitation was offered to people who had been subject to forced labour before, spoke Polish and were rated as not constituting a threat.&lt;ref name=cordell7980/&gt; Once granted Polish citizenship, they were encouraged to Polonize their names, or to restore their original Polish names if they had been Germanized during the war.&lt;ref name=cordell7980/&gt; Numbers of how many were offered to stay in Poland as Poles and eventually did are not available,&lt;ref name=cordell7980/&gt; but it is assumed that the vast majority had rather opted and left for Germany by 1960.&lt;ref name=cordell7980&gt;K.

Some Germans were exempted from expulsion and retained because of their professional skills, if no Pole was at hand to replace them. These Germans were treated as second class citizens, especially regarding salary and food supply. So-called "abandoned wives", whose husbands found themselves in post-war Germany and were not able to return, were compelled to "seek divorce" and were not allowed to leave for Germany before 1950–52.{{sfn|Kamusella|2004|p=29}} The other ones retained were not allowed to leave before 1956; these measures also included the families of the retainees or the parts thereof remaining with them.{{sfn|Kamusella|2004|p=29}} About 250,000 had been issued [[East Germany|East German]] passports in the 1950s, ending their former statelessness.&lt;ref name=wolff79/&gt; Many were concentrated in the areas of [[Wrocław]] (former Breslau)&lt;ref name=wolff79/&gt; [[Wałbrzych]] (former Waldenburg),&lt;ref name=wolff79/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner Besch, ''Dialektologie: Ein Handbuch zur Deutschen und allgemeinen Dialektforschung'', Walter de Gruyter, 1982, p.178, {{ISBN|3-11-005977-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Legnica]] (former Liegnitz),&lt;ref name=wolff79/&gt; all in [[Lower Silesia]], and in [[Koszalin]] (former Köslin)&lt;ref name=wolff79&gt;Stefan Wolff, ''German Minorities in Europe: Ethnic Identity and Cultural Belonging'', Berghahn Books, 2000, p.79, {{ISBN|1-57181-504-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pomerania]]. How many actually left is uncertain, though it is generally assumed that the majority emigrated.&lt;ref name=wolff79/&gt; The German society of Wałbrzych has maintained a continuous existence since 1957.&lt;ref name=wolff79/&gt;

==Repopulation==
People from all over Poland moved in to replace the former German population in a process parallel to the expulsions. While the Germans were interned and expelled, up to 5 million&lt;ref&gt;Karl Cordell, Andrzej Antoszewski, ''Poland and the European Union'', 2000, p.168 ({{ISBN|978-0-415-23885-4}}) gives 4.55 million within the first years&lt;/ref&gt; settlers were either attracted or forced to settle the area. The settlers can be grouped according to their background:
*settlers from Central Poland moving in on a voluntary basis (majority)&lt;ref&gt;Karl Cordell, Andrzej Antoszewski, ''Poland and the European Union'', 2000, p.168, ({{ISBN|978-0-415-23885-4}}): 2.8 million of 4.55 million within the first years&lt;/ref&gt;
*Former slave workers of Nazi Germany: 2.8 million&lt;ref&gt;A. Paczkowski, ''Historia Powszechna/Historia Polski'', Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN, Warszawa 2008, tom 16, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Poles that had been freed from [[forced labor]] in [[Nazi Germany]] (up to two millions)&lt;ref name="books.google.de"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Js8XWnqR6HMC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=vertreibung+polen&amp;lr=&amp;sig=ACfU3U3NdOJdTE4UOsjN6kQyponjdFIP8A#PPA142,M1 Dierk Hoffmann, Michael Schwartz, ''Geglückte Integration?'', p142]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Cordell, Andrzej Antoszewski, ''Poland and the European Union'', 2000, p.168, ({{ISBN|978-0-415-23885-4}}): 1.5 million of 4.55 million within the first years&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Polish population transfers (1944–46)|Repatriants]] – Poles expelled from the [[Kresy]] areas east of the [[Curzon Line]] annexed by the [[Soviet Union]], who made up for less than 10% of the overall Polish population, were preferably settled in the new western territories where they made up for 26% of the population (up to two million)&lt;ref name="books.google.de"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Cordell, Andrzej Antoszewski, ''Poland and the European Union'', 2000, p.168, ({{ISBN|978-0-415-23885-4}}): 1.55 million of 4.55 million within the first years&lt;/ref&gt;
*Poles coming from Western and Southern Europe, e.g. French miners&lt;ref&gt;http://www.af.walbrzych.pl/modules.php?name=Stowarzyszenie&amp;artid=2&lt;/ref&gt; and farmers from [[Prnjavor, Bosnia and Herzegovina]] region
*non-Poles forcefully resettled during [[Operation Vistula]] in 1947. Large numbers of Ukrainians were forced to move from south eastern Poland under a 1947 Polish government operation, termed Operation Vistula, which aimed at breaking up, and therefore assimilating, the Ukrainian population, which had not been expelled eastward already, throughout the newly acquired territories. Belarusians living around the area around Białystok were also pressured into relocating to the areas vacated by fleeing German population for the same reasons. This scattering of members of non-Polish ethnic groups throughout the country was an attempt by the Polish authorities&lt;ref&gt;Thum, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; to dissolve the unique ethnic identity of groups like the Ukrainians, Belarusians and [[Lemkos]], and broke the proximity and communication necessary for strong communities to form.
*Tens of thousands of Jewish [[Holocaust]]-survivors, most of them being "[[Polish population transfers (1944–46)|repatriates" from the East]], settled mostly in [[Lower Silesia]] creating Jewish cooperatives and institutions - the largest communities were founded in [[Wrocław]], [[Szczecin]], [[Dzierżoniów]] and [[Wałbrzych]].&lt;ref&gt;Selwyn Ilan Troen, Benjamin Pinkus, Merkaz le-moreshet Ben-Guryon, ''Organizing Rescue: National Jewish Solidarity in the Modern Period'', pp.283-284, 1992, {{ISBN|0-7146-3413-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7146-3413-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However most of them later left Poland.
*10,000 - 15,000 Greeks and Slavomacedonians - [[Refugees of the Greek Civil War]]

==Formal end of the expulsions==
After 1 January 1948, Germans were primarily shipped to the [[Soviet occupation zone]] (after 3 October 1949, the [[German Democratic Republic]]), based on a Polish-Soviet agreement.&lt;ref name=Janusz143144/&gt; Most Germans had been expelled by the end of 1947. In entire 1948, a relatively small number of 42,700 were expelled, and another 34,100 in 1949.&lt;ref name=Janusz143144/&gt; In 1950, 59,433 Germans were expelled following a bi-lateral agreement between the [[People's Republic of Poland]] and the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic (GDR)]], 26,196 of whom however headed for [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name=Janusz143144/&gt; Between October 1948 and December 1950 all 35,000 German prisoners of war detained in Poland were shipped to Germany.&lt;ref name=Janusz143144/&gt;

On 10 March 1951, the Polish "Bureau for Repatriation" (PUR) was disbanded; all further resettlement from Poland to Germany was carried out in a non-forcible and peaceful manner by the Polish state travel agency Orbis.&lt;ref name=Janusz143144&gt;Grzegorz Janusz in Manfred Kittel, ''Deutschsprachige Minderheiten 1945: ein europäischer Vergleich'', Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2007, pp.143,144, {{ISBN|3-486-58002-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographic estimates==
According to the [[census in Poland|Polish census]] of 1946, there were still 2,036,400 Germans in the "''[[Recovered Territories]]''", 251,900 in the pre-war Polish territories (primarily [[Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship|eastern Upper Silesia]], [[Pomerelia]] and [[Greater Poland]]) and the former [[Free City of Danzig]], and 417,000 in the process of "verification" as "new" Poles.&lt;ref name=kittel142&gt;Manfred Kittel, ''Deutschsprachige Minderheiten 1945: ein europäischer Vergleich'', Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2007, p.142, {{ISBN|3-486-58002-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The census data did not include former German citizens already "verified" as ethnic Poles, Germans in forced labor or detention camps and otherwise detained Germans, and Germans employed by the Soviet administration.&lt;ref name=kittel142/&gt;

According to S. Banasiak, 3,109,900 Germans were expelled to the Soviet and British [[Allied occupation zones in Germany|occupation zones in Germany]] and thereby registered by Polish officials between 1945 and 1950.&lt;ref name=kittel144/&gt; Registration by Polish officials was not exhaustive, especially in 1945.&lt;ref name=kittel144/&gt; An unknown number left without formal registration or was expelled by Soviet military authorities without notifying by Polish officials responsible for statistics.&lt;ref name=kittel144/&gt; Also, especially in 1945, many Germans returned to their former homes and some were expelled more than once.&lt;ref name=kittel144&gt;Manfred Kittel, ''Deutschsprachige Minderheiten 1945: ein europäischer Vergleich'', Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2007, p.144, {{ISBN|3-486-58002-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tomasz Kamusella]] cites estimates of 7 million expelled during both "wild" and "legal" expulsions from the ''[[Recovered Territories]]'' (''Deutsche Ostgebiete'') until 1948. The number is based on 1946 census in which citizens were asked specifically if they were Polish or German. The expelled included German autochthons stripped of Polish citizenship and additional 700,000 members of the German minority from areas of pre-war Poland.{{sfn|Kamusella|2004|p=29}} Kamusella states that about 5 million had fled from the former eastern territories of Germany, and 500,000 from pre-war Poland in 1944 and 1945, that another 3.325 million were expelled from the former German territories in 1946–1948 (3 million from Czechoslovakia, and 250,000 from Hungary), emphasizing these numbers are not exhaustive.{{sfn|Kamusella|2004|p=22}}

Overy cites approximate totals of those evacuated, migrated, or expelled between 1944–1950 from East Prussia: 1.4 million to Western Germany, 609,000 to Eastern Germany; from West Prussia: 230,000 to Western Germany, 61,000 to Eastern Germany; from the former German area East of the Oder-Neisse: 3.2 million to Western Germany, 2 million to Eastern Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Overy, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kacowicz, about 3.5 million people had fled before the organized expulsions began, mainly driven by fear of the advancing [[Soviet Army]], between seven hundred and eight hundred thousand Germans were affected by the "wild" expulsions, and another three millions were expelled in 1946 and 1947.&lt;ref name=Kacowicz100101/&gt;

==Legacy==

===Post-war===
In Communist Poland, the expulsions were not to be questioned, and ideologically defended by propaganda.&lt;ref name=Kacowicz102&gt;Arie Marcelo Kacowicz, Pawel Lutomski, Population resettlement in international conflicts: a comparative study, Lexington Books, 2007, p.100, {{ISBN|0-7391-1607-X}} [https://www.google.com/books?id=ovck_g0xwX0C&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=expulsion+germans+poland&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA100,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; The expulsions were perceived by many Poles as just with respect to the former [[Nazi]] policies, injustices were balanced off with the injustices during the contemporary [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|"repatriation" of Poles]].&lt;ref name=Kacowicz102/&gt; Except for the use in official anti-German propaganda, the expulsions became a [[taboo]] in Polish politics, public, and education for decades.&lt;ref name=Kacowicz102/&gt; German expellee organizations who did not accept the post-war territorial and population changes fueled Communist propaganda dismissing them as far-right revanchists.&lt;ref name=Kacowicz103/&gt;

In the first years after the war, the [[bishop of Katowice]] [[Stanisław Adamski]] criticized the expulsion of Germans as inhumane.&lt;ref name=kraft&gt;Kraft, Claudia, [http://library.fes.de/library/netzquelle/zwangsmigration/en-46pl.html Debates on the Expulsion of Germans in Poland since 1945]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Philipp Ther, pre-1989 Polish historiography has in general either underestimated or concealed the role of force during the expulsions.&lt;ref name=Ther82&gt;Philipp Ther, ''Deutsche und polnische Vertriebene: Gesellschaft und Vertriebenenpolitik in SBZ/DDR und in Polen 1945-1956'', Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1998, p.82, {{ISBN|3-525-35790-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ther says that this was caused on the one hand by censorship, and on the other hand by the interpretation of the registration forms the expellees had signed as acquiescence to "voluntary emigration".&lt;ref name=Ther82/&gt;

===Post-communist (1989–present)===
The Polish role in the expulsions could not be contemplated in Poland until the end of the [[Cold War]].{{r|Ka-Lu2007_101}}

In the Polish–German border and neighborhood treaties of 1990 and 1991, the term "expulsion" for the first time replaced the old and euphemistic Communist term "resettlement" or the [[Potsdam Agreement|Potsdam]] term "population transfer", which were used by Polish officials before.&lt;ref name=Kacowicz103&gt;Arie Marcelo Kacowicz, Pawel Lutomski, Population resettlement in international conflicts: a comparative study, Lexington Books, 2007, p.103, {{ISBN|0-7391-1607-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though "''Wypędzenie''", the Polish term for "''expulsion''", is since widely used officially, in regular linguistic practice it is still an emotionally loaded term, not as it were, something that is being acknowledged, and closely attached to the question of "right" or "wrong".&lt;ref name=Kacowicz104/&gt; Polish and joint German-Polish scholarly research and public debates in Poland were now concerned with issues like moral examination of the expulsions, responsibility for the inflicted suffering, terminology, numbers, and whether the expellee's status was that of a political subject or object.&lt;ref name=Kacowicz103/&gt;

In 1995, Polish foreign minister [[Władysław Bartoszewski]] expressed regret for innocent German suffering before German [[Bundestag|parliament]] and [[Bundesrat of Germany|federative council]].&lt;ref name=Kacowicz104&gt;Arie Marcelo Kacowicz, Pawel Lutomski, Population resettlement in international conflicts: a comparative study, Lexington Books, 2007, p.104, {{ISBN|0-7391-1607-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Polish public opinion research institute CBOS polled public opinion about a phrase in the letter of reconciliation the Polish bishops wrote in 1965: "''We forgive and ask for forgiveness''": 28% agreed; 45% agreed with the offering of forgiveness, but rejected the part that asked for forgiveness; 22% disagreed altogether.&lt;ref name=Kacowicz104/&gt;

In addition, anxiety is growing in Poland about the legal and moral claim to Poland's post-war territorial gains.&lt;ref name=Kacowicz107&gt;Arie Marcelo Kacowicz, Pawel Lutomski, ''Population resettlement in international conflicts: a comparative study'', Lexington Books, 2007, p.107, {{ISBN|0-7391-1607-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal aspects have been investigated by various international law experts coming to different conclusions,&lt;ref name=Kacowicz107/&gt; prompting both Germany and Poland to employ a joint expert team that gave an overall negative answer to chances for such legal challenges.&lt;ref name=Kacowicz107108&gt;Arie Marcelo Kacowicz, Pawel Lutomski, ''Population resettlement in international conflicts: a comparative study'', Lexington Books, 2007, pp.107,108 {{ISBN|0-7391-1607-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polish government made some efforts to sue Germany for damages inflicted on Poland during World War II in return.&lt;ref name=Kacowicz109&gt;Arie Marcelo Kacowicz, Pawel Lutomski, ''Population resettlement in international conflicts: a comparative study'', Lexington Books, 2007, p.109 {{ISBN|0-7391-1607-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advancing German project of erecting a [[Centre Against Expulsions]] depicting the fate of 20th-century European expellees (mostly, but not only, German) is controversially discussed in Poland, and was described by former Polish Prime Minister [[Jarosław Kaczyński]] as "equating the victims with the persecutors".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,2220333,00.html War Compensation Claims Still Plague Polish-German Ties], Deutsche Welle, 30.10.2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish reaction was severely criticized in Germany.&lt;ref name=kraft /&gt;

[[File:Four Evangelists Jordaens Louvre Inv1404.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Jacob Jordaens]], [[The Four Evangelists (painting)|The Four Evangelists]], 1625–1630.]]
In Christian tradition, the '''Four Evangelists''' are Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the authors attributed with the creation of the four [[Gospel]] accounts in the [[New Testament]] that bear the following titles: [[Gospel according to Matthew]]; [[Gospel according to Mark]]; [[Gospel according to Luke]] and [[Gospel according to John]].

==Gospels==
[[Image:France Arles St Trophime Portal Detail.jpg|thumb|The four winged creatures that symbolise the Four Evangelists surround [[Christ in Majesty]] on the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of the [[Church of St. Trophime]] in [[Arles]].]]
[[File:Meister des Evangeliars von Echternach 001.jpg|thumb|The lion symbol of [[St. Mark]] from the [[Echternach Gospels]], here without wings.]]
The gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are known as the [[Synoptic Gospels]], because they include many of the same stories, often in the same sequence.  While the periods to which the gospels are usually dated suggest otherwise,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eYmxAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 | title=Gospel According to St John: Black's New Testament Commentaries| isbn=9781441188229| last1=Lincoln| first1=Andrew| date=2005-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ruP6J_XPCEC&amp;pg=PA18|page=18|title=The Gospel of Matthew|isbn=9780802825018|last1=France|first1=R.T|date=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; convention traditionally holds that the authors were two of the [[Twelve Apostles]] of [[Jesus]], John and Matthew, as well as two "apostolic men,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.v.iv.v.ii.html Tertullian, ''Adv. Marc.'' V.2].&lt;/ref&gt; Mark and Luke:
*[[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]] – a former tax collector who was called by Jesus to be one of the [[Twelve Apostles]],
*[[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] – a follower of [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and so an "apostolic man,"
*[[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] – a doctor who wrote what is now the book of Luke to Theophilus. Also known to have written the book of Acts (or Acts of the Apostles) and to have been a close friend of [[Paul of Tarsus]],
*[[John the Evangelist|John]] – a disciple of Jesus and the youngest of his [[Twelve Apostles]].

They are called [[Evangelism|evangelists]], a word meaning "people who proclaim good news," because their books aim to tell the [[Good News (Christianity)|"good news"]] ("gospel") of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;"The good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God." Mark 1:1&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[iconography]], the evangelists often appear in [[Evangelist portrait]]s derived from classical tradition, and are also frequently represented by the symbols which originate from the four "[[Chayot|living creatures]]" that draw the throne-chariot of God, the [[Merkabah]], in the vision in the [[Book of Ezekiel]] (Chapter 1) reflected in the [[Book of Revelation]] (4.6-9ff), though neither source links the creatures to the Evangelists. Images normally, but not invariably, appear with wings like angels.&lt;ref name="Jermone"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=j0UmWBivNJgC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Jerome+eagle+John&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8XpvT_69McO30QXb7KCOAg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jerome%20eagle%20John&amp;f=false|chapter=Jerome, Preface to Commentary on Matthew | title= The Fathers of the Church |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=|volume = 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="male"&gt;{{cite book| first= Emile | last= Male |title = L'Art religieux du XIIIe siècle en France | trans-title=The Gothic Image: Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century |pages =  35–7| date= 1913 |publisher = Collins |edition = 3 | location = London |isbn=978-0064300322}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the symbols of the Four Evangelists appear together, it is called a [[Tetramorph]], and is common in the [[Romanesque art]] of Europe, in church [[frescoes]] or mural paintings, for instance.

English trans. of 3rd edn, 

The meanings accruing to the symbols grew over centuries, with an early formulation by [[Jerome]],&lt;ref name="Jermone" /&gt; and were fully expressed by [[Rabanus Maurus]], who set out three layers of meaning for the beasts, as representing firstly the Evangelists, secondly the nature of Christ, and thirdly the virtues required of a Christian for salvation:&lt;ref name="male" /&gt; These animals may have originally been seen as representing the highest forms of the various types of animals, i.e., man, the king of creation as the image of the creator; the lion as the king of beasts of prey (meat-eating); the ox as the king of domesticated animals (grass-eating) and the eagle as the king of the birds.

[[File:KellsFol027v4Evang.jpg|thumb|right|The symbols of the four Evangelists are here depicted in the [[Book of Kells]]. The four winged creatures symbolize, clockwise from top left, [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[John the Evangelist|John]], and [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]].]]

* [[Matthew the Evangelist]], the author of the [[Gospel according to Matthew|first gospel]] account, is symbolized by a man. Matthew's gospel starts with pointing Jesus as the son of David, son of Abraham. It then proceeds with genealogy starting from [[Abraham]]. David is mentioned first in this gospel to present Jesus as a King and speaks a lot of the Kingdom of Heaven.

* [[Mark the Evangelist]], the author of the [[Gospel according to Mark|second gospel]] account, is symbolized by a winged lion – a figure of labourous worker. It does not mention genealogy, as it is not of importance for servant.

* [[Luke the Evangelist]], the author of the [[Gospel according to Luke|third gospel]] account (and the [[Acts of the Apostles]]), is symbolized by a winged ox.– a figure of Jesus as our High Priest, a man that represents man to God. The genealogy goes all the way back to Adam. The gospel starts off with a "mute" Hight Priest that can not bless, and ends with Jesus blessing his disciples as He is ascending to Heaven. This tells Christians that they now have Jesus that represents us before God in Heaven as our High Priest.

* [[John the Evangelist]], the author of the [[Gospel according to John|fourth gospel]] account, is symbolized by an [[eagle]] – a figure of the sky, and believed by Christian scholars to be able to look straight into the sun. John starts with an eternal overview of [[Jesus the Logos]] and goes on to describe many things with a "higher" christology than the [[Synoptic Gospels|other three (synoptic) gospels]]; it represents Jesus' [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]], and Christ's [[God|divine nature]]. The gospels reveals the true nature of God and what's in God heart, which is loving, caring and merciful.

Each of the symbols is depicted with wings, following the biblical sources first in [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 1–2, and in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]. The symbols are shown with, or in place of, the Evangelists in early medieval [[Gospel Book]]s, and are the usual accompaniment to [[Christ in Majesty]] when portrayed during the same period, reflecting the vision in Revelation. They were presented as one of the most common motifs found on church [[Portal (architecture)|portal]]s and [[apse]]s, as well as many other locations.&lt;ref&gt;Male, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

When surrounding Christ, the figure of the man usually appears at top left – above Christ's right hand, with the lion above Christ's left arm. Underneath the man is the ox and underneath the lion is the eagle. This both reflects the medieval idea of the order of "nobility" of nature of the beasts (man, lion, ox, eagle) and the text of Ezekiel 1.10. From the thirteenth century their use began to decline, as a new conception of ''Christ in Majesty'', showing the wounds of the Passion, came into use.&lt;ref&gt;Male, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes in Evangelist portraits they appear to dictate to the writing evangelist.

==Naming==
Matthew is often cited as the "first Gospel account," not only owing to its place in the canon, but also in view of the patristic witness to this effect. Most biblical scholars however, see the gospel account of Mark as having been written first (see [[Markan priority]]) and John's gospel account as having been written last.

It has become customary to speak of "the Gospel of Matthew" ... "the Gospel of John", not least because it is shorter and rolls much more smoothly off the tongue; but it is worth noting that the ancient titles do not use the genitive of possession, but the preposition "according to", signifying that each evangelist sets forth the one "Gospel of God" according to his own capacity, but not in the sense of creating his own story.

The same iconography of the Angel, the Lion, the Bull and the Eagle is used extensively in Freemasonry and is clearly displayed on the coat of arms of the United Grand lodge of England amongst others. In Masonic circles it is used to represent the Four Seasons - Lion (Leo - Summer), Bull (Taurus - Spring), Angel (Aquarius - Winter) and Eagle (Scorpio - Autumn).&lt;ref&gt;https://pubastrology.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/house-of-the-rising-sun-v0_7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Described by [[Norbert von Hellingrath]] as "the most German of Germans", Hölderlin was a key figure of [[German Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Readings in Interpretation: Hölderlin, Hegel, Heidegger|series=Theory and History of Literature|volume=26|first=Andrzej|last=Warminski|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|date=1987|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly due to his early association with and philosophical influence on [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], he was also an important thinker in the development of [[German Idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|editor=[[Frederick C.

It was Hölderlin whose ideas showed Hegel that he could not continue to work on the applications of philosophy to politics without first addressing certain theoretical issues. In 1801, this led Hegel to move to Jena where he was to write the ''Phenomenology of Spirit''.... Schelling’s early work amounts to a development of Hölderlin’s concept of Being in terms of a notion of a prior identity of thought and object in his Philosophy of Identity." Christian J. Onof, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/holderli/#H5 "Johann Christian Friedrich Hölderlin"], ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Accessed 15 Jan 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hegel is completely dependent on Hölderlin&amp;nbsp;– on his early efforts to grasp speculatively the course of human life and the unity of its conflicts, on the vividness with which Hölderlin's friends made his insight fully convincing, and also certainly on the integrity with which Hölderlin sought to use that insight to preserve his own inwardly torn life." Dieter Henrich, ''The Course of Remembrance and Other Essays on Hölderlin,'' Ed. Eckart Förster (Stanford: Stanford University, 1997) p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Indeed, the [[Pietism|Pietistic Horizon]] extended for generations up to and including the time when Hegel, together with his friends Hölderlin and Schelling, spent quiet hours strolling along the banks of the [[Neckar]] receiving the theological education they would eventually challenge and transform through the grand tradition now known as German Idealism." Alan Olson, ''Hegel and the Spirit.'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Lauffen am Neckar]], Hölderlin's childhood was marked by bereavement. His mother intended for him to enter the Lutheran ministry, and he attended the [[Tübinger Stift]], where he was friends with Hegel and Schelling. He graduated in 1793 but could not devote himself to the Christian faith, instead becoming a tutor. Two years later, he briefly attended the [[University of Jena]], where he interacted with [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]] and [[Novalis]], before resuming his career as a tutor. He struggled to establish himself as a poet, and was plagued by mental illness. He was sent to a clinic in 1805 but deemed incurable and instead given lodging by a carpenter, Ernst Zimmer. He spent the final 36 years of his life in Zimmer's residence, and died in 1843 at the age of 73.

Hölderlin followed the tradition of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] as an admirer of [[Greek mythology]] and [[Ancient Greek]] poets such as [[Pindar]] and [[Sophocles]], and melded Christian and Hellenic themes in his works. [[Martin Heidegger]], whom Hölderlin had a great influence on, said: "Hölderlin is one of our greatest, that is, most impending thinkers because he is our greatest poet. The poetic understanding of his poetry is possible only as a philosophical confrontation with the manifestation of being achieved in his work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Margins of Political Discourse|first=Fred Reinhard|last=Dallmayr|publisher=SUNY Press|date=1989|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Hölderlin birthplace, Lauffen am Neckar.JPG|thumb|Friedrich Hölderlin's birthplace, Lauffen am Neckar]]
Johann Christian Friedrich Hölderlin was born on 20 March 1770 in [[Lauffen am Neckar]], then a part of the [[Duchy of Württemberg]]. He was the first child of Johanna Christiana Heyn and Heinrich Friedrich Hölderlin. His father, the manager of a church estate, died when he was two years old, and Friedrich and his sister, Heinrike, were brought up by their mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Friedrich Hölderlin: Dichter der bürgerlich-demokratischen Revolution|first=Günter|last=Mieth|publisher=Königshausen &amp; Neumann|date=2001|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1774, his mother moved the family to [[Nürtingen]] when she married Johann Christoph Gok. Two years later, Johann Gok became the [[burgomaster]] of Nürtingen, and Hölderlin's half-brother, Karl Christoph Friedrich Gok, was born. In 1779, Johann Gok died at the age of 30. Hölderlin later expressed how his childhood was scarred by grief and sorrow, writing in a 1799 correspondence with his mother:

{{quote|"When my second father died, whose love for me I shall never forget, when I felt, with an incomprehensible pain, my orphaned state and saw, each day, your grief and tears, it was then that my soul took on, for the first time, this heaviness that has never left and that could only grow more severe with the years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Course of Remembrance and Other Essays on Hölderlin|first1=Dieter|last1=Henrich|first2=Eckart|last2=Förster|publisher=Stanford University Press|date=1997|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Education===
Hölderlin began his education in 1776, and his mother planned for him to join the Lutheran church. In preparation for entrance exams into a monastery, he received additional instruction in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[Latin]] and [[rhetoric]], starting in 1782. During this time, he struck a friendship with [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], who was five years Hölderlin's junior. On account of the age difference, Schelling was "subjected to universal teasing" and Hölderlin protected him from abuse by older students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Palgrave Handbook of German Idealism|first=Matthew C.|last=Altman|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|date=2014|page=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during this time, Hölderlin began playing the piano and developed an interest in [[travel literature]] through exposure to [[Georg Forster]]'s ''A Voyage Round the World''.

In 1784, Hölderlin entered the Lower Monastery in [[Denkendorf, Baden-Württemberg|Denkendorf]] and started his formal training for entry into the Lutheran ministry. At Denkendotf, he discovered the poetry of [[Friedrich Schiller]] and [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]], and took tentative steps in composing his own verses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hölderlin|first=Friedrich |others=Translated by Michael Hamburger|title=Selected Poems and Fragments|year=2007|publisher=Penguin UK|location=London|isbn=978-0-141-96218-4|page=26|edition=bilingual}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known letter of Hölderlin's is dated 1784 and addressed to his former tutor Nathanael Köstlin. In the letter, Hölderlin hinted at his wavering faith in Christianity and anxiety about his mental state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Foretaste of Heaven: Friedrich Hölderlin in the Context of Württemberg Pietism|first=Priscilla A.|last=Hayden-Roy|publisher=Rodopi|date=1994|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hölderlin progressed to the [[Maulbronn Monastery|Higher Monastery]] at [[Maulbronn]] in 1786. There he fell in love with Luise Nast, the daughter of the monastery's administrator, and began to doubt his desire to join the ministry; he composed ''Mein Vorsatz'' in 1787, in which he states his intention to attain "[[Pindar]]'s light" and reach "Klopstock-heights". In 1788, he read Schiller's ''[[Don Carlos (play)|Don Carlos]]'' on Luise Nast's recommendation. Hölderlin later wrote a letter to Schiller regarding ''Don Carlos'', stating: "It won't be easy to study ''Carlos'' in a rational way, since he was for so many years the magic cloud in which the good god of my youth enveloped me so that I would not see too soon the pettiness and barbarity of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essays and Letters|first=Friedrich|last=Hölderlin|editor1=Louth, Charlie|editor2=Adler, Jeremy|publisher=Penguin UK|date=2009|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tübinger Stift, Tübingen.JPG|thumb|Hölderlin attended the [[Tübinger Stift]] (pictured) from 1788 to 1793.]]
In October 1788, Hölderlin began his [[theological]] studies at the [[Tübinger Stift]], where his fellow students included [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Isaac von Sinclair]] and Schelling. It has been speculated that it was Hölderlin who, during their time in Tübingen, brought to Hegel's attention the ideas of [[Heraclitus]] regarding the [[unity of opposites]], which Hegel would later develop into his concept of [[Hegelian dialectics|dialectics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shelton|first=Roy C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M95QAQAAIAAJ|title=The Young Hölderlin|year=1973|publisher=[[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang Publishing, Incorporated]]|location=[[Pieterlen]] and [[Bern]]|isbn=978-3-261-00315-7|id={{ISBN|3-26100315-4}}|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=M95QAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Holderlin+enrolled+in+the+theological+seminary+in+October+1788%22 107]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1789, Hölderlin broke off his engagement with Luise Nast, writing to her: "I wish you happiness if you choose one more worthy than me, and then surely you will understand that you could never have been happy with your morose, ill-humoured, and sickly friend," and expressed his desire to transfer out and study law but succumbed to pressure from his mother to remain in the Stift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hyperion and Selected Poems|series=The German Library|volume=22|first=Friedrich|last=Hölderlin|editor-first=Eric L.|editor-last=Santner|publisher=A&amp;C Black|date=1990|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Hegel and Schelling and his other peers during his time in the Stift, Hölderlin was an enthusiastic supporter of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Good |first1=James Allan |title=A Search for Unity in Diversity: The "permanent Hegelian Deposit" in the Philosophy of John Dewey |date=2006 |publisher=Lexington Books |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he rejected the violence of the [[Reign of Terror]], his commitment to the principles of 1789 remained intense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krell |first1=David Farrell |title=Introduction to "The Death of Empedocles" |date=2008 |publisher=SUNY Press |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hölderlin's republican sympathies influenced many of his most famous works such as ''[[Hyperion (Hölderlin novel)|Hyperion]]'' and ''[[The Death of Empedocles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Magun |first1=Artemy |title=Negative Revolution: Modern Political Subject and its Fate After the Cold War |date=2013 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Career===
After obtaining his magister degree in 1793, his mother expected him to enter the ministry. However, Hölderlin found no satisfaction in the prevailing Protestant theology, and worked instead as a private tutor. In 1794, he met [[Friedrich Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and began writing his [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Hyperion (Hölderlin novel)|Hyperion]]''. In 1795 he enrolled for a while at the [[University of Jena]] where he attended [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]'s classes and met [[Novalis]].

There is a seminal manuscript, dated 1797, now known as the ''Das älteste Systemprogramm des deutschen Idealismus'' ("[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]"). Although the document is in Hegel's handwriting, it is thought to have been written by either Hegel, Schelling, Hölderlin, or an unknown fourth person.&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"&gt;Kai Hammermeister, ''The German Aesthetic Tradition'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a tutor in [[Frankfurt am Main]] from 1796 to 1798 he fell in love with [[Susette Borkenstein Gontard|Susette Gontard]], the wife of his employer, the banker Jakob Gontard. The feeling was mutual, and this relationship became the most important in Hölderlin's life. After a while, their affair was discovered, and Hölderlin was harshly dismissed. He then lived in [[Bad Homburg vor der Höhe|Homburg]] from 1798 to 1800, meeting Susette in secret once a month and attempting to establish himself as a poet, but his life was plagued by financial worries and he had to accept a small allowance from his mother. His mandated separation from Susette Gontard also worsened Hölderlin's doubts about himself and his value as a poet; he wished to transform German culture but did not have the influence he needed. From 1797 to 1800, he produced three versions—all unfinished—of a tragedy in the Greek manner, ''[[The Death of Empedocles]]'', and composed odes in the vein of the Ancient Greeks [[Alcaeus (comic poet)|Alcaeus]] and [[Asclepiades of Samos]].

===Mental breakdown===
In the late 1790s, Hölderlin was diagnosed as suffering from [[schizophrenia]], then referred to as "[[hypochondrias]]", a condition that would worsen after his last meeting with Susette Gontard in 1800. After a sojourn in [[Stuttgart]] at the end of 1800, likely to work on his translations of [[Pindar]], he found further employment as a tutor in [[Hauptwil|Hauptwyl]], Switzerland and then at the household of the [[Hamburg]] consul in [[Bordeaux]], in 1802. His stay in the French city is celebrated in ''Andenken'' ("Remembrance"), one of his greatest poems. In a few months, however, he returned home on foot via Paris (where he saw authentic Greek sculptures, as opposed to Roman or modern copies, for the only time in his life). He arrived at his home in Nürtingen both physically and mentally exhausted in late 1802, and learned that Susette Gontard had died from [[influenza]] in Frankfurt at around the same time.

At his home in Nürtingen with his mother, a devout Christian, Hölderlin melded his Hellenism with Christianity and sought to unite ancient values with modern life; in Hölderlin's elegy ''Brod und Wein'' ("Bread and Wine"), Christ is seen as sequential to the Greek gods, bringing bread from the earth and wine from [[Dionysus]]. After two years in Nürtingen, Hölderlin was taken to the court of Homburg by Isaac von Sinclair, who found a sinecure for him as court librarian, but in 1805 von Sinclair was denounced as a conspirator and tried for treason. Hölderlin was in danger of being tried too but was declared mentally unfit to stand trial. On 11 September 1805, Hölderlin was delivered into the clinic at [[Tübingen]] run by Dr. [[Johann Heinrich Ferdinand von Autenrieth]], the inventor of a mask for the prevention of screaming in the mentally ill.&lt;ref&gt;Constantine (1990), p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HölderlinturmTübingen.jpg|thumbnail|The first floor of the yellow tower (now known as the [[Hölderlinturm]]) was Hölderlin's place of residence from 1807 until his death in 1843.]]
The clinic was attached to the [[University of Tübingen]] and the poet [[Justinus Kerner]], then a student of medicine, was assigned to look after Hölderlin. The following year Hölderlin was discharged as incurable and given three years to live, but was taken in by the carpenter Ernst Zimmer (a cultured man, who had read ''Hyperion'') and given a room in his house in Tübingen, which had been a tower in the old city wall with a view across the [[Neckar]] river. The tower would later be named the [[Hölderlinturm]], after the poet's 36-year-long stay in the room. His residence in the building made up the second half of his life and is also referred to as the ''Turmzeit'' (or "Tower period"). &lt;!--Zimmer and his family cared for Hölderlin until his death in 1843, 36 years later. [[Wilhelm Waiblinger]], a young poet and admirer, left a poignant account of Hölderlin's day-to-day life during these long, empty years.--&gt;

===Later life and death===
[[File:Holderlin1842.jpg|left|160px|thumb|Sketch of Hölderlin by Luise Keller, 1842.]]
In the tower, Hölderlin continued to write poetry of a simplicity and formality quite unlike what he had been writing up to 1805. As time went on he became a minor tourist attraction and was visited by curious travelers and autograph-hunters. Often he would play the piano or spontaneously write short verses for such visitors, pure in versification but almost empty of affect—although a few of these (such as the famous ''Die Linien des Lebens'' ("The Lines of Life"), which he wrote out for his carer Zimmer on a piece of wood) have a piercing beauty and have been set to music by many composers.&lt;ref&gt;Constantine (1990), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hölderlin's own family did not financially support him but petitioned successfully for his upkeep to be paid by the state. His mother and sister never visited him, and his stepbrother only once did so. His mother died in 1828: his sister and stepbrother quarreled over the inheritance, arguing that too large a share had been allotted to Hölderlin, and unsuccessfully tried to have the will overturned in court. Neither of them attended his funeral in 1843, nor had the friends of his childhood, Hegel and Schelling, had anything to do with him for years; the Zimmer family were his only mourners. His inheritance, including the patrimony left to him by his father when he was two, had been kept from him by his mother and was untouched and continually accruing interest. He died a rich man, but did not know it.&lt;ref name="Constantine 1990, p. 300"&gt;Constantine (1990), p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
The poetry of Hölderlin, widely recognized today as one of the highest points of [[German literature]], was little known or understood during his lifetime, and slipped into obscurity shortly after his death; his illness and reclusion made him fade from his contemporaries' consciousness&amp;nbsp;– and, even though selections of his work were published by his friends during his lifetime, it was largely ignored for the rest of the 19th century.

[[File:Ermunterung001.jpg|thumb|250px|Hölderlin's [[autograph]] of the first three stanzas of his [[ode]] "Ermunterung" ("Exhortation")]]
Like Goethe and Schiller, his older contemporaries, Hölderlin was a fervent admirer of ancient Greek culture, but for him the [[Greek mythology|Greek gods]] were not the plaster figures of conventional classicism, but wonderfully life-giving actual prescenses, yet at the same time  terrifying. Much later, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] would recognize Hölderlin as the poet who first acknowledged the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic]] and [[Dionysian Mysteries|Dionysian]] Greece of the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mysteries]], which he would fuse with the [[Pietism]] of his native [[Swabia]] in a highly original religious experience.&lt;ref name="Josephson-Storm"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 88 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hölderlin developed an early idea of [[Social cycle theory|cyclical history]] and therefore believed political radicalism and an aesthetic interest in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], and, in parallel, Christianity and [[Paganism]] should be fused.&lt;ref name="Josephson-Storm" /&gt; He understood and sympathised with the Greek idea of the [[Tragedy|tragic fall]], which he expressed movingly in the last stanza of his "Hyperions Schicksalslied" ("Hyperion's Song of Destiny").

In the great poems of his maturity, Hölderlin would generally adopt a large-scale, expansive and unrhymed style. Together with these long hymns, odes and elegies&amp;nbsp;– which included "Der Archipelagus" ("The Archipelago"), "Brod und Wein" ("Bread and Wine") and "Patmos"&amp;nbsp;– he also cultivated a crisper, more concise manner in epigrams and couplets, and in short poems like the famous "Hälfte des Lebens" ("The Middle of Life").

In the years after his return from Bordeaux, he completed some of his greatest poems but also, once they were finished, returned to them repeatedly, creating new and stranger versions sometimes in several layers on the same manuscript, which makes the editing of his works troublesome. Some of these later versions (and some later poems) are fragmentary, but they have astonishing intensity. He seems sometimes also to have considered the fragments, even with unfinished lines and incomplete sentence-structure, to be poems in themselves. This obsessive revising and his stand-alone fragments were once considered evidence of his mental disorder, but they were to prove very influential on later poets such as [[Paul Celan]]. In his years of madness, Hölderlin would occasionally pencil ingenuous rhymed [[quatrain]]s, sometimes of a childlike beauty, which he would sign with fantastic names (most often "Scardanelli") and give fictitious dates from previous or future centuries.

==Dissemination and influence==
[[File:Hölderlin Memorial, Lauffen am Neckar.JPG|325px|thumb|Friedrich Hölderlin Memorial in Lauffen am Neckar]]
Hölderlin's major publication in his lifetime was his novel ''[[Hyperion (Hölderlin novel)|Hyperion]]'', which was issued in two volumes (1797 and 1799). Various individual poems were published but attracted little attention. In 1799 he produced a periodical, ''Iduna''.

In 1804, his translations of the dramas of [[Sophocles]] were published but were generally met with derision over their apparent artificiality and difficulty, which according to his critics were caused by transposing Greek idioms into German. However, 20th-century theorists of [[translation]] such as [[Walter Benjamin]] have vindicated them, showing their importance as a new—and greatly influential—model of poetic translation. ''Der Rhein'' and ''[[Patmos (poem)|Patmos]]'', two of the longest and most densely charged of his hymns, appeared in a poetic calendar in 1808.

[[Wilhelm Waiblinger]], who visited Hölderlin in his tower repeatedly in 1822–23 and depicted him in the protagonist of his novel ''Phaëthon'', stated the necessity of issuing an edition of his poems, and the first collection of his poetry was released by [[Ludwig Uhland]] and [[Christoph Theodor Schwab]] in 1826. However, Uhland and Schwab omitted anything they suspected might be "touched by insanity", which included much of Hölderlin's fragmented works. A copy of this collection was given to Hölderlin, but later was stolen by an autograph-hunter.&lt;ref name="Constantine 1990, p. 300"/&gt; A second, enlarged edition with a biographical essay appeared in 1842, the year before Hölderlin's death.

Only in 1913 did [[Norbert von Hellingrath]], a member of a literary circle around poet [[Stefan George]], publish the first two volumes of what eventually became a six-volume edition of Hölderlin's poems, prose and letters (the "Berlin Edition", ''Berliner Ausgabe''). For the first time, Hölderlin's hymnic drafts and fragments were published and it became possible to gain some overview of his work in the years between 1800 and 1807, which had been only sparsely covered in earlier editions. The Berlin edition and von Hellingrath's perfervid advocacy of Hölderlin's work shifted the emphasis of appraisal from his earlier elegies to the enigmatic and grandiose later hymns.

Already in 1912, before the Berlin Edition began to appear, [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] composed his first two ''[[Duino Elegies]]'' whose form and spirit draw strongly on the hymns and elegies of Hölderlin. Rilke had met von Hellingrath a few years earlier and had seen some of the hymn drafts, and the ''Duino Elegies'' heralded the beginning of a new appreciation of Hölderlin's late work. Although his hymns can hardly be imitated, they have become a powerful influence on modern poetry in German and other languages, and are sometimes cited as the very crown of German lyric poetry.

[[File:Hölderlindenkmal - 1881.jpg|thumb|Hölderlin Monument in the [[Alter Botanischer Garten Tübingen]].]]
The Berlin Edition was to some extent superseded by the Stuttgart Edition (''Grosse Stuttgarter Ausgabe''), which began to be published in 1943 and eventually saw completion in 1986. This undertaking was much more rigorous in textual criticism than the Berlin Edition and solved many issues of interpretation raised by Hölderlin's unfinished and undated texts (sometimes several versions of the same poem with major differences). Meanwhile, a third complete edition, the Frankfurt Critical Edition (''Frankfurter Historisch-kritische Ausgabe''), began publication in 1975 under the editorship of [[Dietrich Sattler]].

Though Hölderlin's [[hymn]]ic style—dependent as it is on a genuine belief in the divine—creates a deeply personal fusion of Greek mythic figures and romantic mysticism about nature, which can appear both strange and enticing, his shorter and sometimes more fragmentary poems have exerted wide influence too on later German poets, from [[Georg Trakl]] onwards. He also had an influence on the poetry of [[Hermann Hesse]] and [[Paul Celan]]. (Celan wrote a poem about Hölderlin, called "Tübingen, January" which ends with the word ''Pallaksch''&amp;nbsp;— according to Schwab, Hölderlin's favourite [[neologism]] "which sometimes meant Yes, sometimes No".)

Hölderlin was also a thinker who wrote, fragmentarily, on poetic theory and philosophical matters. His theoretical works, such as the essays "Das Werden im Vergehen" ("Becoming in Dissolution") and "Urteil und Sein" ("Judgement and Being") are insightful and important if somewhat tortuous and difficult to parse. They raise many of the key problems also addressed by his [[Tübingen]] roommates Hegel and Schelling, and, though his poetry was never "theory-driven", the interpretation and exegesis of some of his more difficult poems has given rise to profound philosophical speculation by thinkers such as [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Alain Badiou]].

===Music===

Hölderlin's poetry has inspired many composers, generating [[vocal music]] and [[Instrumental|instrumental music]].

;Vocal music
One of the earliest settings of Hölderlin's poetry is ''[[Schicksalslied]]'' by [[Johannes Brahms]], based on ''Hyperions Schicksalslied''. Other composers of Hölderlin settings include [[Peter Cornelius]], [[Hans Pfitzner]], [[Richard Strauss]] (''Drei Hymnen''), [[Max Reger]] ("[[An die Hoffnung]]"), [[Alphons Diepenbrock]] (''Die Nacht''), [[Walter Braunfels]] ("[[Der Tod fürs Vaterland]]"), [[Richard Wetz]] (''Hyperion''), [[Josef Matthias Hauer]], [[Hermann Reutter]], [[Stefan Wolpe]], [[Paul Hindemith]], [[Benjamin Britten]] (''[[Sechs Hölderlin-Fragmente]]''), [[Hans Werner Henze]], [[Bruno Maderna]] (''Hyperion'', ''Stele an Diotima''), [[Luigi Nono]] (''Prometeo''), [[Heinz Holliger]] (the ''Scardanelli-Zyklus''), [[Hans Zender]] (''Hölderlin lesen I-IV''), [[György Kurtág]] (who planned an opera on Hölderlin), [[György Ligeti]] (''[[Three Fantasies after Friedrich Hölderlin]]''), [[Hanns Eisler]] (''Hollywood Liederbuch''), [[Viktor Ullmann]], [[Wolfgang von Schweinitz]], [[Walter Zimmermann]] (''Hyperion'', an epistolary opera) and [[Wolfgang Rihm]]. [[Carl Orff]] used Hölderlin's German translations of Sophocles in his operas ''Antigone'' and ''Oedipus der Tyrann''.

[[Wilhelm Killmayer]] based three song cycles, ''[[Hölderlin-Lieder]]'', for tenor and orchestra on Hölderlin's late poems; [[Kaija Saariaho]]'s ''Tag des Jahrs'' for mixed choir and electronics is based on four of these poems. In 2003, [[Graham Waterhouse]] composed [[Song cycles (Waterhouse)|a song cycle]], ''Sechs späteste Lieder'',  for voice and cello based on six of Hölderlin's late poems. Several works by [[Georg Friedrich Haas]] take their titles or text from Hölderlin's writing, including ''Hyperion'', ''Nacht'', and the solo ensemble "... ''Einklang freier Wesen'' ..." as well as its constituent solo pieces each named “... aus freier Lust ... verbunden ...”.

The German [[progressive rock]] band [[Hoelderlin]] is named after Hölderlin, Finnish [[melodic death metal]] band [[Insomnium]] has set Hölderlin's verses to music in several of their songs, and many songs of Swedish [[alternative rock]] band [[ALPHA 60]] also contain lyrical references to Hölderlin's poetry.

;Instrumental music
[[Robert Schumann]]'s late piano suite ''Gesänge der Frühe'' was inspired by Hölderlin, as was [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]]'s string quartet ''Fragmente-Stille, an Diotima'' and parts of his opera ''Prometeo''. [[Josef Matthias Hauer]] wrote many piano pieces inspired by individual lines of Hölderlin's poems. [[Paul Hindemith]]'s ''First Piano Sonata'' is influenced by Hölderlin's poem ''Der Main''. [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s  [[Symphony No. 7 (Henze)|Seventh Symphony]] is partly inspired by Hölderlin.

==Recordings==

Many of Hölderlin's work have been recorded as audio books. Notable is a reading by [[Martin Heidegger]] for the dedication of the record label [[ECM Records|ECM]]. It has released two readings of Hölderlin poems: one in 1984 by Swiss actor [[Bruno Ganz]] simply called ''Hölderlin'' (ECM 1285), and one in 2012 by voice actor/vocalist Christian Reiner called ''Turmgedichte'' (ECM 2285). Furthermore, ECM released an album called ''Scardanelli'' with spoken texts and music from the 2000 movie of the same name by German director Harald Bergmann.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecmrecords.com/Catalogue/New_Series/1700/1761.php ECM Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the 1991 recording of [[Heinz Holliger]]'s ''Scardanelli-Zyklus'' (ECM 1472) conducted by the composer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecmrecords.com/Catalogue/New_Series/1400/1472.php ECM Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gang of Amazons''' ({{lang-ru|Банда &amp;laquo;амазонок&amp;raquo;|translit=Banda "amazonok"}}) is a family of serial killers from [[Stavropol]], Russia, who committed a series of murders and robberies over a span of 6 years. Inessa Tarverdiyeva along with her husband Roman Podkopaev, 35, and two daughters Viktoria, 25, and Anastasiya, 13, began their murder spree in 2007, but some accounts detail offenses as far back as 1998. Their spree lasted until their apprehension in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/08/14/ordinary-housewife-mum-husband-and-daughters-carried-out-killing-spree-of-30-murders-in-russia_n_7360174.html|title='Ordinary Housewife' Mum, Husband And Daughters Carried Out Killing Spree Of 30 Murders In Russia|date=2014-08-14|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/news/1019090/nursery-teachers-crime-family-behind-30-murders-in-russia/|title=Nursery teacher’s crime family behind 30 murders in Russia|date=2013-09-17|work=The Sun|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/russian-family-murder-thirty-victims-2280992|title=Middle-class mum, dad and two daughters kill THIRTY victims in six-year reign of terror|last=Atkins|first=Nigel|date=2013-09-17|work=mirror|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of name ==
Initially, the "Gang of Amazons" was believed{{by whom|date=September 2017}} to be called such due to the predominance of women over men that composed the group, however, the name actually came about from journalists who covered the investigation of crimes committed by the family. The family has never used this name when referencing themselves. The family was only dubbed the Gang of Amazons after media discovered that a knife engraved with "My Favorite Amazon" that was found not too far from the Chudakov crime scene. The local media assumed that this was Inessa's knife,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rg.ru/2014/01/23/banda.html|title=Семейная банда призналась в 30 убийствах и полсотне грабежей|date=2014-01-23|work=Российская газета|access-date=2017-09-12|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, according to Igor Berezin, Deputy Head of the Investigation Department of Russia's Investigation Committee for Rostov Oblast, the knife belonged to a girl who had no affiliation with the gang or their crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kp.ru/daily/26139/3028795/|title=Нож с надписью "Моей любимой амазонке" никогда не принадлежал ростовской банде убийц|last=правды»|first=Ирина ПОТЕРЯ {{!}} Сайт «Комсомольской|date=2013-09-27|work=KP.RU - сайт «Комсомольской правды»|access-date=2017-09-12|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
The family lived in a comfortable home in the village of Divnoye in Stavropol, the administrative seat of the Stavropol Krai.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The family used camping trips to the Rostov Oblast as a cover to commit their crimes.

Roman Podkopaev (Russian: '''Роман Подкопаев'''), 35, patriarch of the family, was a registered dentist. He was the suspect of the mysterious death of Inessa's first husband and later went on to marry Inessa.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2423451/Russian-serial-killer-family-murdered-30-people-including-women-children.html|title=Russian 'middle class family 'murdered 30 men, women and children'|work=Mail Online|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inessa Tarverdiyeva (Russian: '''Инесса Тарвердиева'''), 46, martriarch of the family was a nursery school teacher and homemaker, but gave up being a teacher for their robbery and murder business. Had a profound hatred for police after her lover, a policeman, left her for another woman.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Viktoria Tarverdiyeva (Russian: '''Виктория Тарвердиева'''), 25, eldest daughter from Inessa's prior union with Azerbaijani man Arzu Tarverdiyev who died under mysterious circumstances at a power grid where he worked.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Anastasiya Tarverdiyeva (Russian: '''Анастасия Тарвердиева)''', 13, youngest member of the family and juvenile at the time of the murders&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sergei Sinelnik (Russian: '''Сергей Синельник'''), 35, husband to Anastasiya Sinelnik and brother in law of Podkopaev. Was a police officer that provided inside information to the family to aid in the commission of their crimes.

Anastasiya Sinelnik (Russian: '''Анастасия Синельник'''), 26, sister of Podkopaev, denies involvement in crimes committed by her relatives, however was known to store goods stolen by the family.

== Killing spree ==

=== Mikhail Zlydnev ===
On February 17, 2008, in Aksai, bandits committed the murder of Mikhail Zlydnev, head of the information security department of the State Drug Control Service, and his wife. They were shot in their home, and then finished off with knives. The killers took a doublet, a jacket, and a TV tuner from the victims' house.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=http://www.liveinternet.ru/users/2832015/post141642511/&amp;usg=ALkJrhj-h_L6_0Av9ANh6wUS_HqTqKFVWg|title=Google Translate|website=translate.googleusercontent.com|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Federal highway murder ===
July 17, 2008 in the Aksai district on the federal highway, the gang members shot a car in which Rostovites Alexei Sazonov and Julia Vasilyeva were traveling. Sazonov was killed, and Vasilyeva was seriously wounded. The family stole a purse with a driver's license, a passport, and a woman's handbag.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Chudakov family ===
On July 8, 2009, the family overpowered and shot Lieutenant Colonel Dmitry Chudakov of Nizhny Novgorod, his wife and seven-year-old son with a Saiga .410 semi-automatic rifle while they were parked on the shoulder of the road. Their 11-year-old daughter, Veronika, did not meet a similar fate and was stabbed 37 times. After the family murdered Chudakov's family, they made off with a laptop, hairdryer, and a camera, worth £950 in assets, leaving gold jewelry untouched.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This became the family's most high-profile case. Alexei Serenko, from the nearby city of Aksay, was mistakenly accused of and spent two years in jail for the crime. The only evidence against him were the results of the ballistic examination. The expert of the Ministry of Justice had stated that the Chudakovs, as well as three other people in the vicinity, were killed by Serenko's carbine. Later it was shown that the findings of the examination were erroneous and Serenko was released from jail. According to media reports, the Chudakovs were killed by a gang of "tsapkovsky", but later attributed the crime to the "Gang of Amazons".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Teenage girls ===
In 2010, the family partook in another murder and robbery involving two teenage girls, one of whom was supposedly Tarverdiyeva's goddaughter. The family waited for their victims to return to home, knowing they had weapons and money, but when only the family's two daughters showed up Podkopaev and Tarverdiyeva ambushed them. The girls were tortured and had their eyes gouged out before they were murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scaredyet.net/nursery-school-teacher-dentist-murderers/|title=From Nursery School Teacher and Dentist to Murderers - Scared Yet?|date=2015-06-18|work=Scared Yet?|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Inessa admits to killing adults, she claims she never killed children stating, "My husband shot them."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Novocherkassk murders ===
On March 10, 2009, in the outskirts of Novocherkassk, the family broke into a house and killed the two residents who lived there. They first shot them with the Saiga carbine, and then finished them off with a knife. The family took passports, a laptop, a camera, women's boots, a doublet, and a man's jacket.

On September 19, 2012 in Novocherkassk, the family killed 26-year-old Vladimir Mandrik and 22-year-old Vasily Camforin, two employees of a private security company who responded to alarms going off at a local dental clinic. The family took the security guard's service weapons, which included a Kalashnikov assault rifle and two pistols.

On November 29, 2012 in Novocherkassk, the family infiltrated the home of Novocherkassk resident and taxi driver Vadim Lozhkov. The man attempted to pursue them, but was killed using the guns stolen from the security guards.

On March 16, 2013 in Aksai, the family killed car inspector Nikolai Kutsekon, who left his apartment after hearing his car alarm go off. After seeing suspicious people near his car, he attempted to detain them, but was shot and killed.

On April 8, 2013 in the outskirts of Novocherkassk, the family shot at a car of grocery store employees responding to alarms that were set off at their store. The wounded driver Nikolai Korsunov survived, however his partner, Yuri Statsenko, died later on at the hospital.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Andrei Yurin ===
April 24, 2013 in the Aksai district, the family murdered 39-year-old police lieutenant Andrei Yurin, who was going out for a late night drive. Yurin was shot at point-blank range shortly after leaving his home. The family attempted to break into the house, but the door was locked, so the family left without taking anything, saving Yurin's wife and child from his fate.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2015/11/24/66506-ubiytsy-gde-to-ryadom|title=Убийцы где-то рядом|work=Новая газета - Novayagazeta.ru|access-date=2017-09-12|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capture and arrest ==
On September 8, 2013, after shooting an unnamed couple, Podkopaev and Viktoria proceeded to rob the home of a former military officer in Aksai, Rostov Oblast. After finding no money, they proceeded to steal candles and alcohol from the home as well as drumsticks from the refrigerator. Both Podkopaev and Viktoria escaped via scooter but were stopped shortly after at an ID by patrol officer Ivan Shakhovoi. Instead of showing his documents, Podkopaev pulled out his weapons and opened fire, killing Shakhovoi. Podkopaev was killed shortly after back up arrived and was shot and killed. Officer Aleksey Lagoda, who was merely wounded, was able to radio for backup. Viktoria also made it out of the gun fight alive, however, was seriously wounded. Shortly after, Inessa and Anastasiya were captured by police at a campsite where they were guarding a large cache of weapons including 20 firearms, silencer, grenades, and ammunition. Items stolen from victims were also discovered at the encampment, assisting Sledkom in linking the family to dozens of murders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The family saw their crimes like having a day at the office. Tarverdiyeva, who also confessed to hating police, stated “I am a gangster by nature.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Arrested alongside the family were Podkopaev’s sister, Anastasiya Sinelnik, 26, and her husband Sergei, 31, a former policeman. It is suspected that the couple aided the family in the commission of their crimes by providing them inside information about police operations and officer movements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While Anastasiya would not openly admit to aiding and abetting the family in the commission of their crimes in court, she would not admit to her knowledge of the planning of the crimes. Her husband Sergei confessed to feeling pleased that his colleagues did not know who was committing the crimes, but that he did. The couple stored stolen goods in their home and occasionally brought jewelry to the jeweler for sale or to be melt down into new jewelry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Investigation ==
The journalists of ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' conducted their own investigation into the circumstances of the detention of the gang members and in great detail - the circumstances of the death of the family of Dmitry Chudakov, which caused a great public outcry. According to journalists, the investigative authorities once again fabricated evidence, attributing to the gang of "Amazons" crimes that they did not commit [6]. At a preliminary hearing in the Rostov Regional Court, Dmitry Chudakov's mother Valentina Chudakova announced the Amazon gang to murder was not involved in her son's murder and filed a motion to send the criminal case for an additional investigation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to the investigators, Inessa seemed to take pride in her crimes and see herself as an admirable hero. During the interrogations, she said that she killed the police officers from personal hatred, and said, "It is a pity that they did not kill them very much".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Bay of Pigs weapons===
In February 1961 Novel was part of a group of people which took weapons from a munitions bunker in [[Houma, Louisiana]], which was owned by the [[Schlumberger| Schlumberger Company]].

According to a report in the ''[[New Orleans States-Item]]'' newspaper Banister served as a munitions supplier for the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] and continued to deal weapons from his office until 1963.&lt;ref&gt;New Orleans States-Item, April 25, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gus Russo]] has written about the existence of a [[letter of marque]], signed by [[Robert F. Kennedy]], who was U.S. Attorney General at the time, which supposedly gave Banister the go-ahead to "liberate" the weaponry.&lt;ref name = "Live by the Sword"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Gus Russo]]| title = Live by the Sword: The Secret War Against Castro and the Death of JFK| publisher = Bancroft Press| date = 25 November 1998| page = 151| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7Q87Rrxyh9wC&amp;pg=PA602| accessdate = 9 June 2012| isbn = 978-1890862015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novel had received a key to the bunker from Banister.

===1964 New York World's Fair===
In the early 60's, Novel served as Director of Operations for the [[1964 New York World's Fair#Federal and state exhibits|'Bourbon Street Pavilion']] at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. The pavilion reportedly achieved the highest gross income of any single commercial pavilion at the fair. For this work, Novel was called an "Entrepreneurial Prodigy &amp; Boy Wonder"" in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Cuccia| first = Ron| title = Fair Shake - Is New Orleans' latest party worth it?

===New Orleans business===
After the world fair closed, Novel moved back to New Orleans, where he set up a business focused on [[Eavesdropping|electronic eavesdropping]]. Through his company, 'International Dynamics Corp', he manufactured and installed electronics for politicians, businessmen and diplomats. He also bought/leased a Caribbean-style restaurant/club called 'Jamaican Village Inn', which was located at [[Rampart Street|800 North Rampart Street]].&lt;ref name="Slippery"/&gt; While Novel was in Ohio, resisting Garrison's attempt to get him extradited, two waitresses of the club were arrested and charged with violating obscenity law, for topless table-serving.&lt;ref&gt;

===Conflict with Garrison===

====Work at Garrison's office====
Without Garrison's knowledge, Novel was directed by [[Walter Sheridan]] (Federal investigator, NBC News reporter and associate of the [[Kennedy family]]) to seek work as an operative inside Garrison's office. Willard E. Robertson (a [[petitioner]] and businessman with political connections and ally of Jim Garrison and Louisiana Governor [[John McKeithen]], who was alleged to have lent financial support to Garrison's investigation of [[Clay Shaw]] through an organization known as "Truth or Consequences") recommended Novel as a "electronics expert" to District Attorney Jim Garrison.&lt;ref name = "Plot Or Politics"&gt;{{cite book| author = Rosemary James, [[Jack Wardlaw]]| title = Plot Or Politics?| publisher = [[Pelican Publishing Company|Pelican Publishing]]| date = 31 January 1967| pages = 35,38,108–111,113,115,118,155,157,160–162,164,166| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lGnINlzlpsIC&amp;pg=PA38| accessdate = 5 June 2012| isbn = 978-0911116113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| authorlink = https://www.law.cornell.edu/| title = Willard E.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, during the time an appeal in the Waco trial reached its end, a secret FBI report was released which stated that Novel worked with Garrison in attempts to fake photographic evidence to link [[Fidel Castro]] with the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| last = Dorman| first = Michael| title = FBI: Investigator Tried To Fake Oswald Photo| publisher = [[Newsday]]| date = January 13, 1997

Reavis has stated that Novel's work at Garrison's office was "amply documented" and quoted Novel saying: "I was working as Garrison's chief of security, while at the same time working for the White House to destabilize Garrison's operation."&lt;ref name = "Conspiracy dreams"/&gt;

====Shaw Hearing Witness Subpoena====
During Clay Shaw's preliminary hearing, Novel was twice subpoenaed to appear before the Orleans Parish Grand Jury. The second time Novel did not show up, while he had left the state. In order to get Novel extradited, Garrison's office issued two warrants for Novel's arrest. The first arrest warrant was based on him being a material witness in the Clay Shaw investigation, which historically labeled him as "the missing witness" in Garrison's assassination conspiracy theory.&lt;ref name = "Plot Or Politics"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "anderson_middlesboro"&gt;{{cite news| author = [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]]| title = Jack Anderson| newspaper = Middlesboro Daily News| date = Feb 14, 1981| url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GRlCAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fqoMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4820,2268215&amp;dq=gordon-novel+garrison&amp;hl=en| accessdate = 2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second arrest warrant was based on a new accusation; Garrison accused Novel of having "burglarized" the munitions bunker in Houma. During the same time-frame, on 25 May 1967, the ''New Orleans States-Item'' published a detailed article on the Clay Shaw case. In that article the New Orleans States-Item produced a handwritten letter, that experts identified as Novel's handwriting, which referred to a CIA connection to his advertising agency. Until then Novel had publicly denied any CIA connections. After the letter was revealed, Novel's attorney, Steve Plotkin, said that Novel wrote the letter and that Novel had CIA connections in New Orleans. While holding off his extradition, Novel organized a news conference in [[Columbus, Ohio]], where he publicly defended himself against Garrison's accusation of burglary. During the conference, reporters were told that; there were CIA operations in New Orleans, an advertising agency in New Orleans (which was operated by Novel) did indeed serve as a CIA front, that the raid on the Houma munitions bunker was a "patriotic act". Later on, Plotkin further specified Novel's role as an "intermediary", but added that Novel's work had "little or nothing to do with the Bay of Pigs invasion and certainly had absolutely nothing to do with the assassination of President Kennedy". The extradition proceedings were eventually dropped on 3 July 1967, due to defects/incomplete extradition papers.&lt;ref name = "Plot Or Politics"/&gt;

===Novel vs Garrison-Playboy Libel Suit===
In an October 1967 interview for [[Playboy Magazine]], Garrison accused Novel of being a paid employee of the CIA and hinted at complicity in the JFK assassination.&lt;ref name = "Jim Garrison Interview"&gt;{{cite web| authorlink = [[Playboy]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Novel filed a $10-million libel suit against Garrison and Playboy in [[United States federal courts|Federal Court]],&lt;ref name="Petersburg" /&gt; being represented by [[Elmer Gertz]], who was an expert in reputation damage and [[smear campaign]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Ronald K.L.

===J. Edgar Hoover allegations===
In an episode of the [[PBS]] program ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' aired on February 9, 1993, Novel said he saw photos of FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] engaged in oral sex with his aid [[Clyde Tolson]].&lt;ref name="Werts"&gt;{{cite news |last=Werts |first=Diane |date=February 9, 1993 |title=Documentary details Hoover's alleged homosexuality |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19930209&amp;id=tmwzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=STgHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5781,2308679 |newspaper=Bangor Daily News |location=Bangor, Maine |page=17 |accessdate=December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode incorporated the work of author [[Anthony Summers]] whose book ''Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J.

===Watergate===
In 1974, columnist [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] wrote that [[Charles Colson]] consulted Novel on the possible use of a [[Degaussing| degaussing device]] that could erase copies of the [[Watergate tapes]] stored in at the White House and the CIA from a distance. Eventually, Colson and Novel mutually decided not to do this, because of its danger to other national security tapes and computers. According to Colson, the plan never came close to development.&lt;ref&gt;

===New Orleans firebomb case===
Jim Garrison's successor to the seat of district attorney [[Harry Connick Sr.]] brought charges against Novel for conspiracy to firebomb part of New Orleans by balloons on behalf of a world's fair Novel was promoting. After three previous prosecutions, that included a hung jury, a mistrial and a conviction with three-year sentence, the conviction was overturned due to "tremendous conflicts" in government testimony. Columnist [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] reported that "Eminent legal scholars say a fourth prosecution in a non-capital case is virtually unprecedented, and raises the issue of retaliatory prosecution". Connick denied there was intention to "persecute" Novel.&lt;ref name="Conspiracy dreams"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "anderson_middlesboro"/&gt;

===DeLorean===
Novel worked as private investigator to the [[DeLorean Motor Company]] chairman John DeLorean in 1982, and subsequently became a business partner. DeLorean claimed there was a conspiracy between Britain's Conservative Party and U.S. and British intelligence agents to close DeLorean's manufacturing plant in Northern Ireland. DeLorean's claims relied on Gordon Novel's investigation and resulting evidence. The alleged conspiracy included an attempt to frame/entrap DeLorean for cocaine trafficking, against which DeLorean eventually successfully defended himself in the resulting lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Greenwald| first = Marilyn| title = Tired of intrigue - DeLorean's partner wants to spend more time with family and new 'baby'| newspaper = [[The Columbus Citizen-Journal]]| date = August 14, 1985| url = https://www.scribd.com/msmith_100160/d/95706313-Tired-of-Intrigue-Marilyn-Greenwald-Columbus-Citizen-Journal| accessdate = 6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Greenwald| first = Marilyn| title = Revved-up DeLorean to be assembled here| newspaper = [[The Columbus Citizen-Journal]]| date = August 1986| url = https://www.scribd.com/msmith_100160/d/95706140-Revved-Up-DeLorean-to-Be-Assembled-Here-Marilyn-Greenwald-Columbus-Citizen-Journal| accessdate = 6 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = De Lorean Reveals 'conspiracy'

When Flynt refused to name Novel as the supplier of the tape, he was charged and convicted to a 5½ month sentence for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref name="Conspiracy dreams"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| work = The New York Times| title = Around The Nation; Flynt Indicted On Charge Of Desecrating The Flag| agency = UPI| date = November 26, 1983| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/26/us/around-the-nation-flynt-indicted-on-charge-of-desecrating-the-flag.html| accessdate = May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waco===
Novel was hired as chief investigator by former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, in the aftermath of the [[Waco Siege]] of 1993. Ramsey Clark provided legal counsel for some of the surviving members of [[Branch Davidians|Branch Davidian]], as well as more than a hundred family members of those who had died or were injured in the confrontation. Novel has stated that his analysis of a [[Forward looking infrared|FLIR]] tape, made by a [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|Nightstalker aircraft]], indicates serious misconduct, e.g. federal agents firing upon people inside the compound while they were trying to flee the fire.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Hijitus''' is an Argentine [[comic]] [[superhero]] created by [[Manuel García Ferré]]. He made his debut in September 1955 in the comic strip ''The Adventures of Pi-Pío'', published in ''[[Billiken]]'' magazine. He was only a side character then, but became the protagonist of his own [[action-comedy]] [[animated series]] ''[[The Adventures of Hijitus]]'' which was broadcast in Argentina between 1967 and 1974. The TV series is frequently re-transmitted on Argentinian television as many Argentinians perceive it as nostalgic.

== Profile ==

Hijitus lives inside the [[Manuel Garcia Ferre]] universe shared with many other characters like Anteojito, Larguirucho, and others.

Hijitus lives inside a giant pipe in the outskirts of town with his dog Pichichus. For Argentinian popular culture "living inside a pipe" is analogous to being poor, so this means that Hijitus economic situation is bad. He does possess, however, a magical hat that allows him to convert into a superhero with multiple powers.

Both the comic and series have a similar, simple structure. Hijitus is a poor good-hearted kid that fights against Professor Neurus (a mad scientist)' evil plans, transforming into a superhero named Super Hijitus and acts to fix the issues. A recurrent theme was Neurus trying to steal Hijitus' magic hat, for possessing his powers, only to ending falling and ending on jail.

== Powers and abilities ==
Hijitus is a normal human being. However, whenever he uses his hat, he transforms into Super Hijitus, a super hero with super strength, super speed, super endurance and other occasional super powers like super breath or heat vision, similar to [[Superman]].

== Media ==
The first animated appearance of the character, named ''Las Aventuras de Hijitus'', made its debut on TV in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recuerdosanimados.com.ar/Hijitus-serie%2060.htm Hijitus on Recuerdos Animados website]&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 September 1973, a movie with the same name, was released in cinemas. Hijitus had also a comic book, edited in 1970.

}}{{Texas History}}
'''James Clinton Neill''' (c. 1788{{spaced ndash}}1848)&lt;ref&gt;Handbook of Texas Online, s.v. "," [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fne11]  (accessed July 29, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; was a 19th-century [[United States|American]] [[soldier]] and [[politician]], most noted for his role in the [[Texas Revolution]] and the early defense of the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]]. He was born in North Carolina.

==Early life and career==
James Clinton Neill was born in 1788 in [[Rowan County, North Carolina]], the third child (and third son) of James Neill and Hannah Clayton Neill.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;King, C. Richard, ''James Clinton Neill, The Shadow Commander of the Alamo'', Eakin Press; {{ISBN|1-57168-577-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  William Clinton Neill (James Clinton's grandfather), was a captain in the American Revolution, who along with five of his sons, including James Clinton's father James, fought in the War for Independence. James Clinton's uncle, Lieutenant William Neill, was killed at the [[Battle of Ramsour's Mill]]. The Clinton middle name comes from both his paternal grandfather and grandmother, Captain William Clinton Neill and his wife Mary "Polly" Clinton Neill. 

By at least 1807, some members of the James Neill family had moved to south-central Tennessee, in and around Bedford and Marshall counties. In this vicinity, James Clinton married Margaret Harriett Ferguson in 1807. It is likely that James Clinton Neill was acquainted with a near-neighbor around those parts at the same time, [[David Crockett]], another Tennessean who would become a Texas Revolution hero. Like Crockett, J.C. Neill fought in the Creek Indian War, enlisting with the West Tennessee Militia (protecting present day Alabama). He enlisted on October 1, 1813 and was discharged on March 15, 1815. He participated in the latter part of the [[War of 1812]], during the [[Creek War]]. Although wounded, he fought in the decisive battle against the [[Red Sticks]], at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]].&lt;ref name="tamu.edu"&gt;[http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/adp/archives/feature/neill/neill.html TAMU, Hardin, J.C. Neill: Forgotten Alamo Commander]&lt;/ref&gt;

Neill served as a captain under Major William Woodfolk. The battalion was designated as "Separate Battalion of West Tennessee Militia". This battalion was based at Fort Jackson most of the time from late November 1814 to early 1815. Some of the men were stationed at Fort Decatur, where the remnants of the defeated Creek Nation came to surrender, seeking food and supplies (surrendering Creeks also went to Fort Jackson). One company, under Captain Abner Pearce, was stationed at Fort Montgomery. Woodfolk was a wealthy land speculator who owned a large plantation in Jackson County.  In addition to potentially sharing time with Davy Crockett, during this military service James Clinton Neill may well have also met his future Texas Revolution commander, Sam Houston.

===Politician===
By at least 1820, J.C. Neill had moved his family to Greene County, Alabama. He served in the Alabama state legislature and was also a justice of the peace in Jackson County. He lived in [[Tennessee]] (present day Alabama) with his wife Margaret Harriett, who bore him three children{{spaced ndash}}George Jefferson Neill (b. 1808), Samuel Clinton Neill (b. 1815) and Harriett (b. 1820).

The family moved to [[Texas]] in 1831 with [[Stephen F. Austin]]'s third colony where he received a league of land (4,428) acres. They settled in (Viesca District) which is now [[Milam County, Texas|Milam County]]. Neill served as a district representative in the [[Convention of 1833]].

==Texas Revolution==

===Militia captain===
Due to his previous experience in battle, Neill had some knowledge of [[artillery]]. In 1834 Neill and his family moved to Mina, modern day [[Bastrop, Texas|Bastrop]]. On September 28, 1835, when armed conflict with [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]]'s [[Mexico|Mexican]] troops seemed inevitable, he joined the [[Texian]] [[militia]] as a [[Captain (United States)|captain]] of artillery. On October 2, 1835, he saw action at the [[Battle of Gonzales|conflict at Gonzales]]. Texian John Holland Jenkins recorded that Neill actually fired the famed Gonzales "Come and Take It" cannon, crediting him with firing "the first shot of the Texas Revolution."

After Gonzales, James would move onwards to [[the Alamo]] and join with [[Stephen F. Austin]]'s forces in the [[Siege of Bexar]]. From December 5&amp;ndash;10, Neill's battery provided covering fire for the assault on [[San Antonio de Béxar]]. He had gained an additional artillery piece from the [[Battle of Concepción]] and two more from the [[New Orleans Grays]]. They would be placed in the Texian post, just west of the Alamo, confronting the town, however their fire could not shake Cos from Bexar. Then, Neill and his command formed a plan. They took a cannon across the San Antonio River and fired upon the Alamo as a diversionary tactic.&lt;ref name=Hardin80&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  The plan worked and the Texians were able to enter into Bexar. House to house fighting would eventually push the Mexicans back and into the Alamo. On December 8, the Mexican Army made a counterattack, Neill and his crew were there to answer back with canister. The flying hailstorm would quickly end the advance, ultimately resulting in the surrender of the Mexican forces on December 9.&lt;ref name=Hardin88&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military officer===
On December 7, the Texas General Council had commissioned Neill [[lieutenant colonel]] of artillery in the regular Texian army. Having received several captured Mexican field pieces to augment his firepower, he now commanded over twenty artillery pieces,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/adp/history/1836/the_battle/the_weapons/cannon.html TAMU Cannon Count]&lt;/ref&gt; the largest amount west of the Mississippi River and north of the Rio Grande.&lt;ref name="tamu.edu"/&gt;
Neill had been recommended for the commission by one of his neighbors, D. C. Barrett, who wrote to [[Texian Army]] commander [[Sam Houston]] that "age and experience with his militia rank &amp; title, would seem to justify his first commission as a field officer".&lt;ref name=winders88and89&gt;quote in Winders (2004), pp. 88&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alamo commander===
On December 21, 1835, Houston requested that Neill, now a lieutenant colonel of an artillery company, take command of the Texian and Tejano garrison stationed at the [[Alamo Mission]] in San Antonio de Bexar.  The orders also specified that Neill should make a report to Houston detailing the current state of the defenses in the city and what improvements were needed.&lt;ref name=winders89&gt;Winders (2004), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Texian garrison was woefully undermanned and underprovisioned, with fewer than 100&amp;nbsp;soldiers remaining by January 6, 1836.   Neill wrote to the [[Consultation (Texas)|provisional government]]: "If there has ever been a dollar here I have no knowledge of it".&lt;ref name=todish29&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Neill requested additional troops and supplies, stressing that the garrison was likely unable to withstand a siege greater than four days.&lt;ref name=todish29/&gt;&lt;ref name=todish30&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Texian government was in turmoil and unable to provide much assistance.&lt;ref name=todish31&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;A week after Neill sent his letter, the Texian provisional legislature impeached [[Henry Smith (Texas Governor)|the governor]], who in turn disbanded the legislature.  The interim constitution had given neither party the authority to take those actions, and no one in Texas was entirely sure who was in charge. (Todish ''et al.'' (1998), pp. 30&amp;ndash;1.)&lt;/ref&gt; Four different men claimed to have been given command over the entire army;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Houston, [[James Fannin]], [[Frank W. Johnson]], and Dr. [[James Grant (Texas)|James Grant]] (Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 30.)&lt;/ref&gt;  on January 14 Neill approached Houston for assistance in gathering supplies, clothing, and ammunition.&lt;ref name=todish31/&gt;

On January 17, 1836, [[James Bowie]] arrived to evaluate the situation, with the suggestion from [[Sam Houston]] to remove the artillery and blow up the Alamo. Houston had written the Provisional Government asking for approval of his orders. Houston sent Bowie to San Antonio because he trusted Bowie's opinion. Instead of leaving the Alamo and falling back to Gonzales or Copano Bay, Bowie and Neill became committed to its defense. Bowie, impressed with Neill's leadership, wrote, ''"No other man in the army could have kept men at this post, under the neglect they have experienced''." Despite Houston's orders to have the Alamo destroyed as indefensible, Neill and Bowie vowed ''"... we will rather die in these ditches than give it up to the enemy."'' However, Neill was soon badly in need of supplies, as well as soldiers.

On February 11, Neill left the Alamo, to care for his family, overcome with a serious illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fne11 Handbook of Texas/Neill]&lt;/ref&gt;  He transitioned command to [[William Barret Travis]], the highest-ranking regular army officer in the garrison.  Due to a rift in the command of the Alamo between Bowie and Travis, Neill returned to the Alamo on February 14 and settled the dispute.&lt;ref name=Lindley310&gt;Lindley (2003), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; A resolution was reached; Bowie and Travis would hold joint command of the Alamo. Neill would leave San Antonio just before the [[siege of the Alamo]]. On the day of the final Alamo battle, Neill was in [[Gonzales, Texas|Gonzales]] steadily working to increase the roster of the Alamo relief forces. In Gonzales, he signed a personal voucher on March 6, for ninety dollars to buy medicine for the Alamo garrison. Neill was intent on heading back to the Alamo where unknown to him, the fort had already fallen to Mexican troops on March 6, during the [[Battle of the Alamo]]. On March 7, Neill with Burleson gathered 50 men and headed for the Alamo.
They came close to the Alamo but were repulsed by Mexican cavalry. Neill returned to Gonzales on March 10 after leaving a small party of scouts to observe, who also returned to Gonzales the next day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/adp/history/republic/runaway.html Steve Goodson, The Runaway Scrape]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Army commander===
From late February until Houston's arrivial on March 11, Neill had been in command of the relief troops gathering at Gonzales.&lt;ref name=Lindley310&gt;Lindley (2003), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, on March 13, word was received that the Alamo had fallen. Thus, Neill once again relinquished his command and joined the [[Runaway Scrape|withdrawal]] of [[Sam Houston]]'s army to Groce's Retreat on the [[Brazos River]]. Unable to transport their cannons, Houston ordered them dumped into the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] before abandoning Gonzales. That changed on April 11 when the "Twin Sisters" &amp;mdash;two matched six-pounders&amp;mdash; reached the Texian camp. The brass cannons were a gift from the people of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. Since Neill was a ranking artillery officer, Houston named him to command the revived artillery corps. On April 20, Neill commanded the Twin Sisters during the [[Battle of San Jacinto]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Neill did command the Twin Sisters cannons on April 20th, but this was during a skirmish on the day before the final battle took place.&lt;/ref&gt; During this fight, his artillery corps repulsed an enemy probe of the woods in which the main [[Texian Army]] was concealed. Neill was seriously wounded when a fragment of a Mexican grapeshot caught him in the hip. The final Battle of San Jacinto was fought on April 21.

==Later life==
1838: received a league of land (including a parcel in Henderson County along the confluence of Walnut Creek and the Trinity River) for his services during the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glo.texas.gov/ncu/SCANDOCS/archives_webfiles/arcmaps/webfiles/landgrants/PDFs/2/3/9/239500.pdf Texas General Land Office Land Grant Records]&lt;/ref&gt;

1839: ran for the position of major general of militia, losing to newcomer [[Felix Huston]].

1842: led a ranging [[Texas-Indian wars|expedition]] along the upper [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]], to control hostile Indians.

1844: appointed as an Indian agent, responsible for vast areas of Texas.

1845: granted a lifetime pension of $200 a year, as compensation for San Jacinto injuries.

===Death===
In 1848, he died at his home on Spring Creek in [[Navarro County, Texas]] and was buried next to his wife, who had died near [[Seguin, Texas]] in February 1836.&lt;ref name=Lindley316&gt;Lindley (2003), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
On land owned with two partners, David Reed Mitchell and Thomas I. Smith, one hundred acres was donated on which the town of [[Corsicana, Texas]] would be founded in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;[http://9key.com/markers/marker_detail.asp?atlas_number=5349007232 David Reed Mitchell, marker] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812021126/http://9key.com/markers/marker_detail.asp?atlas_number=5349007232 |date=2011-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 a Texas centennial marker was placed in Guadalupe County, Seguin, Texas in his honor.

In 1986 a Texas sesquicentennial marker was placed in Navarro County, Corsicana, Texas in his honor.

'''Jean Antoine d'Averhoult''', baptized as '''Jan Anthony d'Averhoult''' (21 October 1756 in [[Utrecht]] –  26 August 1792 in [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]]) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] military officer and politician of French [[Huguenot]] extraction, who played a leading role in both the [[Patriottentijd]] and the [[French Revolution]].

==Personal life==
D'Arnoult was born the son of Jean (Jan) d'Averhoult, a captain in the [[Dutch States Army]] and Gerhardina de Valcke, the daughter of a [[Groningen]] ''[[burgemeester]]''. The father was a scion of a French Huguenot noble family (he was a [[French nobility|''Sieur'']] de [[Guincourt]]), that was, however, not part of the Dutch nobility. A great-grandmother migrated to the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1691 after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau|Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] in 1685 with her children, after her spouse died. The family had become fully acculturated as witnessed by the fact that Jan Anthony was baptized in the Jacobi church of Utrecht, that was in use by the congregation of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], and not in the [[Walloon church|''Église Wallonne'']]. But he was an excellent French speaker. The marriage of his parents went badly, as the father had the mother committed to a borstal-like institution, from which she was only released after his death. During this episode Jan Anthony was cared for by his paternal aunts, especially the [[spinster]] Josina Benjamina d'Averhoult&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Who would later commission the portrait by [[Louis-Léopold Boilly]], after they had both migrated to France.&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he would develop a strong attachment. He would never marry.&lt;ref&gt;Bruin, pp. 128-129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
A year after his father's death in 1773 d'Averhoult started his military career as a [[Cornet (rank)|Cornet]] with the cavalry regiment ''Van Eck'' of the States Army.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;His brother Pompejus at the same time became an ''adelborst'' (cadet) in the Dutch navy.&lt;/ref&gt; He received his commission as a lieutenant with the same regiment, and was later promoted to [[Rittmeister|''ritmeester'']] in another cavalry regiment, ''Van Tuyl van Serooskerken''. But in 1785 he resigned his commission. This may have been prompted by his political sympathies. Like many in the early 1780s in the Netherlands he became very critical of the policies of the [[stadtholder]], [[William V, Prince of Orange]] and his regime, that was accused of mismanaging the [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]]. As a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] he was a member of the same lodge as [[Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol]], the author of the revolutionary pamphlet ''[[Aan het Volk van Nederland]]'', published in 1781, that criticized both the current policies of the regime, and the [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] constitution of the Republic, with a [[regenten]]-class that monopolized access to political offices. A political movement of opposition to the [[Orangism (Dutch Republic)|Orangist]], called the [[Patriottentijd|Patriots]] arose, of which d'Averhoult became a member.&lt;ref&gt;Bruin, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Spring of 1785 d'Averhoult took a commission in the ''Turkije'' company of the Utrecht ''[[schutterij]]'' that was being rejuvenated by an influx of Patriot [[Exercitiegenootschap|Free Corps]] members. As such he became a leader of the Patriot revolt in Utrecht, together with people like the student leader [[Quint Ondaatje]], that overturned the old ''[[vroedschap]]'' and replaced it with a popularly elected city council in August 1786. D'Averhoult was elected one of the new members. The Orangist majority in the States of Utrecht did not accept this and moved the States to the Utrecht city of [[Amersfoort]], while the Patriot minority remained in Utrecht. For the time being the Amersfoort States kept hold of the seat of Utrecht province in the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], however. Meanwhile, the Amersfoort States convinced the stadtholder to garrison Amersfoort with States Army troops under his command. These troops threatened the safety of Utrecht city, as witnessed by the fact that the Amersfoort garrison in early May 1787 made an attempt to occupy the sluice in [[Vreeswijk]], a strategic object. The Utrecht city authorities decided to thwart this attack. D'Averhoult was placed in command of the relief force that marched down to Vreeswijk om 9 May 1787. This resulted in the [[Battle of Jutphaas]], that the Patriots under d'Averhoult's cool-headed leadership won.&lt;ref&gt;Bruin, pp. 130-137&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterward a constitutional crisis erupted in the States General. These were equally divided between three Orangist provinces (Zeeland, Gelderland and Friesland) and three Patriot provinces (Holland, Groningen and Overijssel), while Utrecht was leaning Orangist, and held the balance. In June 1787 the rival Patriot States of Utrecht demanded to be seated in the States General, supported by the three Patriot provincial delegations. Patriot Overijssel temporarily presided at the time, and provisionally seated the Patriot States. This led to riotous behavior by the delegation of the Amersfoort States of Utrecht, one of whose members, drew his sword in the meeting hall, and challenged d'Averhoult, who was a member of the rival Patriot delegation, to a duel. This may or may not have been held the next day in the Hague Wood, fortunately with only slight damage to the participants. The Amersfoort delegation was eventually restored to its position of sole representative of Utrecht in the States General, giving the majority to the Orangists. This was one of the proximate causes of the [[Prussian invasion of Holland]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;As a consequence of the loss of a Patriot majority in the States General, the Patriot [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of Holland]] asked for French mediation in the conflict, and this offered an opportunity for Prussia and Great Britain to muscle in on the process, and put their thumbs in the scale in favor of the Orangists.&lt;/ref&gt; That invasion met little resistance from the Patriots, though d'Averhoult again distinguished himself by repelling several Prussian attacks near fort Nieuwersluis, before his troops were overwhelmed, and he was made a prisoner of war. The Prussians treated him respectfully and he was released and allowed to join the Patriot exodus to [[Brussels]], together with his aunt Josina d'Averhoult.&lt;ref&gt;Bruin, pp. 138-139&lt;/ref&gt;

However, d'Averhoult soon moved on to France, where he claimed his old noble title, and French nationality on the basis of it. On the recommendation of his distant cousin [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|the Marquis de la Fayette]], d'Averhoult (now calling himself Jean Antoine) was able to get a commission as a lieutenant-colonel in the French army in February 1788, thanks to the fact that the [[Edict of Versailles]] of 1787 made him eligible to serve, even though he remained a Protestant. A few months later he was promoted to colonel. In 1789 he was made a ''chevalier'' in the [[Order of Military Merit (France)|''Ordre de Mérite Militaire '']].&lt;ref&gt;Bruin, pp. 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Storming of the Bastille]] he attached himself to his cousin, the Marquis de la Fayette, and together with the latter became a member of the faction of the [[Feuillant (political group)|''Feuillants'']]. In September 1791 d'Averhoult was elected a deputy for the [[Arrondissement of Sedan]], in the [[Ardennes (department)|Ardennes]] department in the new [[National Legislative Assembly (France)|National Legislative Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruin, pp. 141-142&lt;/ref&gt;

As a deputy, and member of the ''Feuillants'' d'Avernoult opposed the [[Girondins]], who were more radical. But in other respects he was relatively radical. He became a member of the Diplomatic Committee of the Assembly, in which he was a voice for taking an aggressive stance against the surrounding states, in which the French [[French emigration (1789–1815)|''Émigrés'']] were making difficulties for the new constitutional [[Kingdom of France (1791–92)|kingdom of France]]. He did not think that they were a serious threat yet, but he pointed to the example of the suppression of the Patriots in the Netherlands to show that it was better to nip such a threat in the bud.{{cquote| Permettez, Messieurs, que je cite un exemple récent. Proscrit en Hollande et sur le point d’y périr sur l’échafaud pour la cause de la liberté, j’ai vu cette cause sublime perdue en temporisations. C’est pour avoir employé des demi-moyens ; c’est pour n’avoir pas écrasé ses adversaires, lorsqu’il en était temps, c’est pour s’être attachée aux effets sans s’attaquer aux causes ; c’est pour avoir attendu jusqu’à ce que ses ennemis furent soutenus par une des puissances de premier ordre, que la Hollande est dans les chaînes.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Gentlemen, allow me to cite a recent example. Proscribed in Holland and on the point of dying there on the scaffold for the cause of liberty I have seen that sublime cause lost because of temporisations. It is because of half-measures taken; because of not crushing one's enemies, while there was still time; because of being attached to effects  without attacking the causes; because of having waited until one's enemies were supported by one of the Powers of the first order, that Holland is in chains;Jaurès, p. 864&lt;/ref&gt;}} His proposal to have king [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] issue an ultimatum to the German princes sheltering the ''émigrés'' was accepted on 29 November 1791.&lt;ref&gt;Bruin, p.m 142&lt;/ref&gt;

But d'Averhoult did not wish or expect that France would go to war right away.&lt;ref&gt;Bruin, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; His intervention did contribute to his popularity in the Assembly and on 8 January 1792 he was elected its president for the usual two weeks.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;This was when his aunt commissioned his portrait by [[Louis-Léopold Boilly]]. Note that he wears the red ribbon of the ''Ordre de Mérite Militaire ''; as a Protestant he had received the blue ribbon, when he first was given the decoration, but it had recently been changed; Cf. Bruin, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January 1792 there was a new debate on declaring war on France's external enemies, in particular Austrian emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. D'Averhoult spoke out against it with the following argument: {{cquote|Messieurs, soyons vrais ; les amis de la liberté voudraient venir au secours de la philosophie outragée par la ligue des princes, ils voudraient appeler tous les peuples à cette liberté, et propager une sainte insurrection ; voilà le véritable motif des démarches inconsidérées qu’on vous propose. Mais devez-vous laisser à la philosophie elle-même le soin d’éclairer l’univers, pour fonder, par des progrès plus lents mais plus sûrs, le bonheur du genre humain et l’alliance fraternelle de tous les peuples ? ou bien devez-vous, pour hâter ces effets, risquer la perte de votre liberté et celle du genre humain, en proclamant les droits de l’homme au milieu du carnage et de la destruction ?&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Gentlemen, let us be true; the friends of liberty would want to come to the aid of the philosophy that is outraged by the league of (German) princes, they would want to call all peoples to this liberty, and spread a holy insurrection; that is the real motive for the ill-considered steps that they propose to you. But should you leave to philosophy itself the task of illuminating the universe, to found, by slower, but surer progresses, the happiness of the human race and the fraternal alliance of all peoples? Or should you, for hastening its effects, risk the loss of your liberty and that of the human race, while proclaiming the rights of man in the middle of carnage and destruction?;Jaurès, p. 908&lt;/ref&gt;}} This argument carried the day: the emperor Joseph was censured, but war was not yet declared. But this was only a temporary delay. The ''Girondins'' soon carried the Assembly in forcing a new government on the king, and in April 1792 forcing a declaration of war on emperor Joseph&lt;ref&gt;Bruin, p.144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;D'Averhoult had meanwhile not forgotten his Dutch compatriots in exile in France. On 19 January 1792 he allowed a deputation of Dutch Patriots to address the Assembly; Bruin, p. 143-144&lt;/ref&gt;

France radicalized more and more, and the ''Feuillants'' lost their influence to the ''Girondins'' and the rising [[Jacobin]]s. D'Averhoult nevertheless spoke out against the illiberal measures that were taken, like the reintroduction of internal passports, and the lawlessness of the Paris Mob.  For instance, he spoke out against the lawlessness of the [[Demonstration of 20 June 1792|''Journée de 20 juin'']], even in vain demanding the sanctioning of the local authorities who had failed to suppress that riot. But external developments made his position untenable: the Prussians entered the war after issuing an maladroit ultimatum, in which they demanded the reinstatement of the king in his old powers (reminiscent of the demand to reinstate the stadtholder in September 1787). In the following furor d'Averhoult on 26 July announced that he resigned as deputy in the Assembly. He took a commission as Colonel of the 7th regiment of [[dragoon]]s, and departed for the front in northern France.&lt;ref&gt;Bruin, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Insurrection of 10 August 1792|overthrow of the monarchy on 10 August 1792]] precipitated the defection of the Marquis de la Fayette. And this brought d'Averhoult under suspicion also. On 18 August a warrant for his arrest was issued by the Assembly. He tried to flee across the border near Sedan, together with a servant, but they were intercepted by armed peasants who demanded to see his passport. In the ensuing fight d'Averhoult managed to shoot his way out (though his servant was arrested). D'Averhoult then tried to escape on his own, but was again intercepted by armed peasants. What happened next remains disputed. At some point someone, either d'Averhoult himself, or someone else, put a pistol to the top of his head and pulled the trigger. He died a few hours later, on 26 August 1792 of this wound in Sedan, where he had been transported, in the presence of his Dutch friend Daniël Michiel Gijsbert Heldewier. He was buried in the Protestant cemetery of the ''Faubourg du Fond de Givonne''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruin, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; He was mourned by his aunt, who soon returned to the Netherlands. But [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Princess Wilhelmina]], the wife of the stadtholder, true to form, wrote to her husband: {{cquote|La fin de Daverhoult est digne de sa vie; tous nos Patriotes pourront bien actuellemen recevoir de façon ou d'autre la juste récompense de leurs actions.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The end of Daverhoult is worthy of his life; all our Patriots could in one way or the other now well receive the just deserts of their actions; Cf. Bruin, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Josef Gunzinger''' was born in [[Welschenrohr]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Switzerland]] on March 23, 1892, and died on May 1, 1970 in [[Heiligenschwendi]]. He was made in 1962 "citizen of honor" of the town of his birth.

Son of Melchior Gunzinger, watchmaker, and Elizabeth Allemann. Married 1920 to Rosalia Allemann, household skills teacher.

Upon his apprentiship as a watchmaker in his father’s workshop, he went to [[La Chaux-de-Fonds]] for a one-year furthering of his skills.

== Business ==
1920 he took over the family business and changed the name of the company into Gunzinger Brothers SA. As from 1924, the company started manufacturing watches under the TM [[Technos (watches)|Technos]] that he had previously officially registered.

At its peak in 1970, Technos employed 450 people and exported around the world, particularly in Brazil and Japan. It was by far the biggest employer of the whole valley.

He sold the whole company to [[General Watch Co]]mpany in 1971, a sub-holding of [[ASUAG]].

==Personalities==
Josef Gunzinger was a co-founder of the Federation of the Swiss German watch manufacturers in 1924.

He was Welschenrohr Community Councilor (Executive) between 1917 and 1931, and a member of the Canton of Solothurn Grand Council (1921-1925).

He proved to be an entrepreneur doted of a patriarchal fiber with a social touch, although as a politician he was definitely right wing.

Josef Gunzinger is one of the leading figures of the twentieth century flourishing watch industry, whose exemplary-worth values went far beyond Welschenrohr, where he had been for so long the "king of the village".

'''Jugurtha Hamroun''' ({{lang-ar|يوغرطة حمرون}}; born 27 January 1989) is an [[Algeria]]n professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] or [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for [[Qatar]]i club [[Al Kharaitiyat SC]], on loan from [[Al Sadd SC]].

After starting out at [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]] in France, he went on to compete professionally in Bulgaria, Turkey, Romania and Qatar.

Hamroun represented [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] at [[Algeria national under-23 football team|under-23 level]], making his debut in November 2011.&lt;ref name="Debut"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lebuteur.com/pdf-lebuteur/voir-journal/1096|title=Les Olympiques avertissent le Senegal|trans-title=Olympians caution Senegal|publisher=Le Buteur|language=French|page=6|date=15 November 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116233618/http://www.lebuteur.com/pdf-lebuteur/voir-journal/1096|archivedate=16 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hamroun was born in the town of [[Bouzeguene]] in the [[Tizi Ouzou Province]]. At age 5, he moved with his family to [[France]], where they settled in [[Neuilly-sur-Marne]] in the eastern suburbs of [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="DZFoot"&gt;[http://www.dzfoot.com/article-1530.php Découverte: Interview Jugurtha Hamroun (Discovery: Jugurtha Hamround interview)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721011412/http://www.dzfoot.com/article-1530.php|date=21 July 2009}}; at DZFoot (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Guingamp===
At age 12, Hamroun joined the youth ranks of French club [[En Avant de Guingamp]].&lt;ref name="DZFoot"/&gt; On 8 April 2008, he signed his first professional contract, for a period of three years, and on 29 August of that year he made his [[Ligue 2]] debut, coming as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Cédric Liabeuf]] in the 83rd minute of a 1–1 home draw against [[CS Sedan Ardennes]].

During his three-year spell at the ''[[Stade du Roudourou]]'', Hamroun alternated between the first team and the reserves, going on to appear in 26 competitive games for the former, including twice in the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2010/matches/round=2000036/match=2000720/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Hambourg déroule au Roudourou|trans-title=Hambourg steamrolls at Roudourou|publisher=UEFA.com|language=French|date=20 August 2009|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2010/matches/round=2000036/match=2000757/postmatch/report/index.html|title=En Avant Hambourg!|publisher=UEFA.com|language=French|date=27 August 2009|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chernomorets Burgas===
On 26 July 2011, Hamroun signed a three-year deal with [[Bulgaria]]n team [[PSFC Chernomorets Burgas]], joining on a [[Free transfer (association football)|free transfer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novsport.com/news153325_1062.html|title=Черноморец подписва с Жужу|trans-title=Chernomorets signed with Zhouzhou|publisher=Novsport|language=Bulgarian|date=July 2011|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored in his [[Bulgarian A Football Group|A PFG]] debut, helping to a 2–0 home win over [[PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv]] on 20 August.

===Kardemir Karabükspor===
On 18 January 2012, however, Hamroun moved clubs and countries again, being sold to [[Kardemir Karabükspor]] in the Turkish [[Süper Lig]] for a reported fee of [[Euro|€]]600,000. He played his first match three days later, starting and featuring 70 minutes in the 2–1 home success over [[Trabzonspor]].

In [[2012–13 Süper Lig|his first full season]], Hamroun contributed with 20 scoreless appearances as the side narrowly avoided relegation after ranking 15th.

===Oțelul Galați===
In January 2015, after being a [[free agent]] since the summer, Hamroun signed a six-month contract with Romania's [[FC Oțelul Galați]], who were in the midst of a financial crisis. The second of his [[Liga I]] goals came on 19 April in a 2–1 win at [[2014–15 Liga I|eventual champions]] [[FC Steaua București]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sportnews.ro/reincarnare-pe-arena-nationala-steaua-batuta-de-un-jucator-dinaintea-erei-noastre-povestea-necunoscuta-a-eroului-otelului-algerianul-jughurta-hamroun-sunt-mandru-de-numele-meu-de-razboi-195732.html|title=REÎNCARNARE!

===FCSB===

'''Katherine Harris''' (born April 5, 1957) is an American politician, elected in 1998 as [[Secretary of State of Florida]] and in 2002 to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from Florida. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Harris won the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2002|2002 election]] to represent [[Florida's 13th congressional district]], serving for two terms, from 2003 to 2007. Harris lost her campaign in 2006 for a [[United States Senate]] seat from Florida.

In 1994, Harris was noted for the most expensive campaign for the Florida Senate to date, winning her seat that year in her entry into electoral politics. In the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], Harris gained national attention for her role in the [[Florida election recount]], certifying [[George W. Bush]]'s narrow victory (537 votes) over [[Al Gore]] and awarding him the Florida electors, which gained him the national election.

==Background and personal life==
Harris was born in [[Key West, Florida]] to one of the state's wealthiest and most politically influential families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/11/15/politics/main249787.shtml "The Woman in Charge"]. [[CBS News]]. November 15, 2000.&lt;!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20140507225001/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-woman-in-charge/ --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She is the daughter of Harriet (Griffin) and George W. Harris, Jr., who owned Citrus and Chemical Bank in [[Lakeland, Florida]].&lt;ref name="tracks"&gt;Follick, Joe (July 22, 2001). "Tracks in Florida's Sand", ''[[Tampa Tribune]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2003-08-17/news/0308170039_1_hill-griffin-griffin-iii-ben-hill], ''Orlando Sentinel,'' 17 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Her maternal grandfather was [[Ben Hill Griffin, Jr.]], a successful businessman in the [[citrus]] and cattle industries and a powerful figure in the state legislature. Shortly before his death in 1990, he was ranked as the 261st richest American on the [[Forbes 400]] list.&lt;ref&gt;Narvaez, Alfonso A. (March 2, 1990). [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/02/obituaries/ben-hill-griffin-jr-79-is-dead-leader-in-florida-citrus-industry.html "Ben Hill Griffin Jr., 79, is Dead; Leader in Florida Citrus Industry"], ''The New York Times''.

"Controversy swirls around Harris"], ''Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris' extended family has been active in [[Christian evangelism]].&lt;ref name="floridabaptist"/&gt; Her grandfather was a Christian missionary in Africa, while her aunt and uncle were missionaries in India. They now head the Arab World Missions.&lt;ref name="floridabaptist"/&gt; Harris studied under Dr. [[Francis Schaeffer]] at a L'Abri Fellowship International center. Harris attended Greystone, an all-girls Christian camp at [[Asheville, North Carolina]].  She has said her faith is "the most important thing in my life."&lt;ref name="floridabaptist"/&gt; Harris was reared in the [[Presbyterian Church in America]], but as an adult, she has criticized the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]] for being "more liberal."&lt;ref name="floridabaptist"/&gt; She attends [[Calvary Chapel]], a non-denominational charismatic church in [[Sarasota, Florida]].&lt;ref name="floridabaptist"/&gt;

Harris married Swedish businessman Sven Anders Axel Ebbeson in 1996 and has one stepdaughter, Louise. Sven Ebbeson committed [[suicide]] in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wallace|first=Jeremy|title=Husband of Katherine Harris commits suicide, police say|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20131119/ARTICLE/131119595?p=all|work=Herald Tribune |date=November 19, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508214808/http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20131119/ARTICLE/131119595?p=all |archivedate=May 8, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in college she worked as an intern for U.S. Representative [[Andy Ireland]].

Before entering politics, Harris worked as a marketing executive at [[IBM]] and a vice president of a commercial real estate firm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/1617/katherine-harris "Katherine Harris' Biography"].

Two years later, in 1996, Harris sponsored a bill "to block Riscorp competitors from getting a greater share of Florida [[workers' compensation]] market, [and] also pushed a proposal that would hurt a particular competitor."&lt;ref name="Riscorp" /&gt; This issue later emerged during her campaign for Florida Secretary of State in 1998.

William Griffin eventually pleaded guilty to illegal campaign donations, among allegations of other serious wrongdoing at Riscorp, and served prison time in 1998. The election of Republican [[Jeb Bush]] as governor of Florida is considered to have been a major factor in stopping further state investigation into the Riscorp scandal. According to a ''Sun-Herald'' column from June 2005, "Harris denied any knowledge of the scheme, was never charged with any crime and was cleared of wrongdoing by a state investigator."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gleason, Brian |date=June 28, 2005 |url=http://www.sun-herald.com/NewsArchive2/062805/cl5.htm?date=062805&amp;story=cl5.htm |title=Will Harris get dragged into finance scandal? |work=Sun and Weekly Herald |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101043055/http://www.sun-herald.com/NewsArchive2/062805/cl5.htm?date=062805&amp;story=cl5.htm

===Secretary of State===
Harris was elected Florida Secretary of State in 1998.

====International travel====
During her first 22 months in office, Harris spent more than $106,000 for travel, more than the [[Governor of Florida|governor]] or any other cabinet officer. She visited eight countries including Iran, India, and the Netherlands on ten foreign trips.

In early 2001, Florida Senate leaders eliminated the $3.4&amp;nbsp;million that Harris had budgeted for international relations for the year, assigning it instead to ''Enterprise Florida'', the state's economic development agency. However, Florida House Leader [[Tom Feeney]] said that he disagreed with the Senate and believed that Harris was an able advocate to foreign countries. After the House refused to agree with the proposed budget action, the Senate agreed to restore the money; however, it insisted on a review committee, appointed by Senate President John McKay, Feeney, and Governor [[Jeb Bush]], to evaluate all of Harris' expenditures on international affairs since July 1, 1999, and produce a report.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Lucy (July 31, 2001).

====2000 U.S. presidential election====
{{main|United States presidential election in Florida, 2000}}
As Secretary of State for the State of Florida (and co-chair of George W. Bush's election efforts in Florida), Harris was a central figure in the [[2000 US presidential election]] in Florida.  The election between [[Al Gore]] and [[George W. Bush]] was so close in Florida, separated by 537 votes, that a recount of the votes was called for.

After several recounts were inconclusive and the laws governing recounts were unclear, Harris halted the recounting process. She certified that the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] candidate, Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]], had defeated the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate, Vice President [[Al Gore]], in the popular vote of Florida and thus certified the Republican slate of [[United States Electoral College|electors]]. This victory in Florida allowed Bush to win the election. Her ruling was upheld in the state circuit court, but was subsequently overturned on appeal by the Florida Supreme Court.

The Florida Supreme Court decision was reversed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''. (2000) In a [[per curiam decision]], by a 7-2 vote, the Court in ''Bush v. Gore'' held that the [[Florida Supreme Court]]'s method for recounting ballots was a violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. By a 5–4 vote, the US Supreme Court held that no alternative method for a recount could be established within the time limits set by the State of Florida.

The decision allowed Harris' previous certification of Bush as the winner of Florida's electoral votes to stand. Florida's 25 electoral votes gave Bush, the Republican candidate, 271 electoral votes, defeating Gore, who ended up with 266 electoral votes (with one D.C. elector abstaining).

Harris later published ''Center of the Storm,'' her memoir of the 2000 election controversy.

==United States Congresswoman==
In 2002, Harris ran against [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]] Attorney [[Jan Schneider]] for the congressional district vacated by retiring Republican Rep. [[Dan Miller (Florida politician)|Dan Miller]], winning by 10 percentage points in this solidly Republican district, a victory helped with one of the biggest first term campaign fund raising efforts in the history of this district and substantial support from the Bush family.

Harris considered running for the seat of retiring Senator [[Bob Graham]] in 2004 but was reportedly dissuaded by the Bush White House to allow [[United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development|Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]] [[Mel Martinez]] to run instead. Martinez went on to narrowly beat challenger [[Betty Castor]]. Harris ran for re-election to her House seat in 2004; she was re-elected with a margin almost identical to her first win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srqelections.com/results/gen2004sum.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817092336/http://srqelections.com/results/gen2004sum.htm |title=Official General Election, Sarasota County, November 2, 2004 |publisher= Sarasota County Supervisor of Elections Office |date=November 4, 2004 |archivedate=August 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 speech in [[Venice, Florida]], Harris claimed that a "Middle Eastern" man was arrested for attempting to blow up the power grid in [[Carmel, Indiana]];&lt;ref&gt;Grace, Francie (August 5, 2004).

During a 2004 campaign stop in Sarasota, a local resident, Barry Seltzer, "tr[ied] to 'intimidate' a group of Harris supporters" by menacing Harris and her supporters with his automobile. Witnesses described Seltzer as having swerved off the road and onto the sidewalk, directing it at Harris and her supporters. Nobody was injured in the incident. Seltzer, who claimed he was "exercising [his] political expression," was eventually arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/27/fl.13.harris.attack "Man accused of trying to run down Rep.

==MZM incident==
In 2005 and 2006, a major corporate campaign donor to Harris, Mitchell Wade (founder of [[defense contractor]] [[MZM Scandal|MZM]]), was implicated in several [[Cunningham scandal|bribery scandals]]. Wade had bundled together and donated to Harris's campaign $32,000 in contributions from his employees at MZM, Inc., then reimbursed those employees for the contributions.&lt;ref name="SHT-2006-2-26"&gt;{{cite news|title=Harris didn't tell all about donations |date=February 26, 2006 |author=Wallace, Jeremy |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060226/NEWS/602260310&amp;p=all |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510170913/http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060226%2FNEWS%2F602260310&amp;p=all |archivedate=May 10, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this issue, [[U.S. Attorney]] Kenneth Wainstein said that Harris did not appear to know the donations were obtained illegally.&lt;ref name="SHT-2006-2-26"/&gt; Harris has maintained she had no personal knowledge that her campaign was given illegal contributions. Wade acknowledged that the donations to the Harris campaign were illegal and were part of an attempt to influence Harris to MZM's benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wallace, Jeremy |date=February 26, 2006 |title='Straw' Breaking Harris's Back |url=http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060226/NEWS/602260371/1134 |work=The Ledger |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927191707/http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060226%2FNEWS%2F602260371%2F1134 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents filed with Wade's plea say that he took Harris to dinner in March 2005, a year after the illegal contributions, where they discussed the possibility of another fundraiser and the possibility of getting funding for a Navy [[counterintelligence]] program placed in Harris's district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Contractor Pleads Guilty to Corruption|author=Babcock, Charles R. |work=The Washington Post | date=February 25, 2006 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/24/AR2006022401737.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris sent a letter on April 26, 2005, to defense appropriations subcommittee Chairman [[Bill Young|C. W. Bill Young]], in which Harris sought $10&amp;nbsp;million for a Navy project backed by Wade.&lt;ref name=TBO_harris_shuns/&gt; In the letter, Harris emphasized the importance of the project, asking that it be added to her list of five priorities and identifying it as her new No. 3. Harris later released the April 26, 2005, letter for legal scrutiny, but neither she nor Young would turn over the request form (RFP) used for the proposal.&lt;ref name=TBO_harris_shuns&gt;{{cite news | title=Harris Shuns Spending Requests | url=http://www.tbo.com/news/metro/MGB5MTE1CKE.html | author=Epstein, Keith | publisher=Tampa Tribune |date=March 3, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060628123717/http://www.tbo.com/news/metro/MGB5MTE1CKE.html |archivedate = June 28, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[CQPolitics]]'' noted "Harris's former political strategist, [[Ed Rollins]], spoke on the record about the dinner and detailed a meal that cost $2,800, far in excess of the $50 limit on gifts that members of Congress are allowed to accept" at the Washington restaurant Citronelle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB114722702872148541 |title=Katherine Harris Battles Old Friends For Florida's Keys |date=May 10, 2006 |author=McKinnon, John D. |work=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=May 9, 2014}}&lt;!-- Can't find the CQPolitics reference for this, which would be better. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Wade and Harris discussed MZM's desire for a $10&amp;nbsp;million appropriation, and Wade offered to host a fundraiser for Harris's 2006 Senate campaign. Regarding the MZM contributions, the ''Sentinel'' article goes on to say "The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] has said Wade, who personally handed many of the checks to Harris, did not tell Harris the contributions were illegal". Regarding the expensive meal, the article quotes Harris as saying that she personally had only a "beverage and appetizer" worth less than "$100".

Rollins said that he had conducted a thorough internal investigation into Harris's ties to MZM in hopes of finding conclusive proof of her innocence; but when he could not, he and other advisers, including her lawyer, urged her to drop her candidacy rather than risk federal corruption charges. Although he did not believe Harris intentionally broke any laws, "her story kept changing. Our great concern was that you get into trouble when you don't tell the same story twice ... Maybe you don't think you did anything wrong, but then maybe you start getting questioned about it and so forth, and you may [[perjury|perjure]] yourself. ... Unlike Cunningham, I don't think she set out to violate the law, but I think she was very careless. She heard whatever she wanted to hear, but we could find no evidence whatsoever that this was a project going into her district."&lt;ref name="sptimes_briber_paid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/05/21/State/Briber_paid_for_2nd_m.shtml |title=Briber paid for 2nd meal for Harris|work=St. Petersburg Times |date=May 21, 2006 |accessdate=March 23, 2011 |author=Smith, Adam C. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604213129/http://www.sptimes.com/2006/05/21/State/Briber_paid_for_2nd_m.shtml |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Rollins recalled discussing the $2,800 meal with Harris, Harris told the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' on April 19, 2006, that the cost of the meal was "news to me", and that her campaign had since "reimbursed" the restaurant for the cost of the meal. According to the reporter, when questioned as to why she would reimburse the restaurant for a meal that had been paid for by MZM, Harris abruptly terminated the interview, and her spokesman later called and requested unsuccessfully that the story not be printed. The next day, Harris's campaign issued a statement that she had believed her campaign had reimbursed the restaurant, and that she had donated $100 "which will more than adequately compensate for the cost of my beverage and appetizer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-04-21/news/HARRISDINNER_1_harris-dinner-wade |title=Contractor picked up dinner tab for Harris |date=April 21, 2006 |author=Stratton, Jim |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509225636/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-04-21/news/HARRISDINNER_1_harris-dinner-wade |archivedate=May 9, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris also asserted that most of the cost of the meal was from Wade ordering several unopened bottles of wine to take home, although the management of the restaurant denies ever allowing anyone to take unopened bottles of wine off the premises, saying "Why would we jeopardize our liquor license for the sake of selling a couple bottles of wine?"&lt;ref name="sptimes_briber_paid" /&gt;

In the weeks following the expensive meal, former senior Harris staffers claimed that "they initially rejected a defense contractor's $10&amp;nbsp;million appropriation request last year but reversed course after being instructed by Harris to approve it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Contractor's deal was Harris priority, former staffers say |author=Stratton, Jim | work=Orlando Sentinel |date=May 4, 2006 |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-05-04/news/MHARRISREQUEST0_1_harris-staff-members-wade |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110810204754/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-05-04/news/MHARRISREQUEST0_1_harris-staff-members-wade|archivedate=August 10, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2006, Harris's campaign spokesman Christopher Ingram acknowledged that she had also had a previous dinner with Wade in the same restaurant in March 2004, when the $32,000 in illegal donations had been given to her campaign. Ingram told the press that he did not know how much that meal cost, but that a charitable donation of an unknown amount had been given to a charity whose name he did not know, equivalent to her share of the meal. "She takes responsibility for the oversight that there was no reimbursement," he said.&lt;ref name="sptimes_briber_paid" /&gt;

==2006 Senate race==
{{main|Florida United States Senate election, 2006}}

===Overview===
On June 7, 2005, with support from her new campaign advisors of [[Ed Rollins]] and Jim Dornan, Harris announced her candidacy for the 2006 Florida United States Senate election, challenging [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] [[Bill Nelson]]. Both lackluster fundraising relative to Nelson and [[#Involvement in the MZM scandal|controversy over campaign contributions from MZM]] caused Harris to fall far behind in all polls by May 2006.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}
Late in the primary race, Republican contender Will McBride polled 31 points behind Nelson in a hypothetical election against him, while Harris polled 33 points behind Nelson in the same poll. Harris was still popular among Republican voters and won the September 5 primary over McBride and two other challengers with approximately 50% of the total vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/florida/release-detail?ReleaseId=934 |title=Nelson Has 2 -1 Lead Over Harris, Any GOP Contender |publisher=[[Quinnipiac University]] |date=June 30, 2006 |accessdate=May 10, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510165332/http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/florida/release-detail?ReleaseId=934 |archivedate=May 10, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Harris's support of many Republican causes and her previous statewide victories, some party leaders expressed doubt about her statewide appeal:

* In May 2006, Florida Governor [[Jeb Bush]] questioned Harris's ability to win the general election and encouraged others to challenge her in the primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060508/BREAKING/60508009&amp;p=all |title=Bush says Harris can't win |work=Herald Tribune |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=May 8, 2006 |author=Kaczor, Bill |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510170810/http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060508%2FBREAKING%2F60508009&amp;p=all |archivedate=May 10, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Republican declines to run against Harris | work=Washington Post |agency=Associated Press |date=May 11, 2006 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/10/AR2006051000891_pf.html  |author=Royse, David  &lt;!-- http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11206815.html --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Florida state House of Representatives Speaker [[Allan Bense]] declined the candidacy on May 11 despite public courting by many leaders including Governor Bush.

By late July 2006, Harris had gone through three campaign managers and her campaign was floundering. At that time, it was disclosed that state Republican Party leaders had told Harris they would not support her because she could not win in the general election.

Financial problems plagued Harris' Senate campaign from the start. During the primary, it was clear that the incumbent Senator Nelson had a substantial financial advantage.

On the March 15, 2006, edition of [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[Hannity &amp; Colmes]]'', Harris pledged to spend $10&amp;nbsp;million of her own money, which she said was all of her inheritance, on her campaign. She also stated that her run was dedicated to the memory of her father.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Jeremy (March 16, 2006).

Despite her promise, the $10&amp;nbsp;million never materialized. Reports surfaced that Harris would not actually receive the inheritance from her father, who instead left his entire estate to her mother. She donated $3&amp;nbsp;million to her campaign, but later took back $100,000, fueling speculation that she would be unable to donate the promised amount.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Anita (August 26, 2006).

Nelson defeated Harris by more than one million votes. Harris received less than 39% of the vote.

====Staff resignations====
In late February 2006, in the midst of revelations surrounding Mitchell Wade's illegal contributions, Harris's campaign finance director and her campaign treasurer both resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Setback for Harris campaign is latest of several rough spots |author=Follick, Joe |publisher=Herald Tribune |date=February 26, 2006 |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060226/NEWS/602260714&amp;p=all |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510193734/http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060226%2FNEWS%2F602260714&amp;p=all |archivedate=May 10, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 2006 Harris's top campaign advisor, pollster and campaign manager all resigned with a half-dozen other staffers.

In early April 2006, Harris told the ''[[Tampa Tribune]]'' that some of her ex-campaign staffers and the national Republican party were deliberately sabotaging her campaign by "putting knives in her back" and had warned her that if she did not back out of the campaign, she would get an "April surprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tampatrib.com/MGBEOW9PLLE.html |title=Questions Dog Harris Behavior |author=March, William |author2=Epstein, Keith |work=Tampa Tribune |date=April 4, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621184233/http://www.tampatrib.com/MGBEOW9PLLE.html  |archivedate=June 21, 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former campaign staffer Ed Rollins said "They were all good professionals ...

In June, the Harris campaign received a legal bill for thousands of dollars that contained a reference to "DOJ [[subpoena]]". Later, an ex-aide told the [[Associated Press]] that Harris had received a [[grand jury]] subpoena from federal investigators, but kept it from her top advisers, prompting several staff members to quit when they found out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2006/Ex-Aide-Says-Harris-Hid-Subpoena/id-2287bdcb69eb3c33e47675fca082670c |title=Ex-Aide Says Harris Hid Subpoena |author=Farrington, Brendan |date=August 2, 2006 |agency=Associated Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510202447/http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2006/Ex-Aide-Says-Harris-Hid-Subpoena/id-2287bdcb69eb3c33e47675fca082670c |archivedate=May 10, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 8, 2006, Harris's fourth chief of staff, Fred Asbell, left in order to pursue a "business opportunity".

In late August, Harris lost another key staffer, Rhyan Metzler, in the wake of a disastrous political rally at Orlando Executive Airport. Only 40 people showed up for the event, and Harris blamed the paltry turnout in part on a last-minute change in location. She claimed that a tree fell on the hangar that was originally scheduled to hold the rally, forcing her campaign to switch to another hangar. Airport officials, however, stated that not only had no trees fallen, but also that there are no trees as they get in the way of the airplanes; further adding that the event in fact took place in the hangar that Harris's campaign had originally booked. Harris's campaign blamed Metzler for the comments Harris made after the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-08-22/news/STBRIEFS22_3_1_harris-metzler-hangar |title=Harris loses another staffer |publisher=Orlando Sentinel |accessdate=March 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510215219/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-08-22/news/STBRIEFS22_3_1_harris-metzler-hangar |archivedate=May 10, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 2006, Harris was interviewed on ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', where she responded to the criticisms from her former staffers with "We have their email traffic, we know what was behind all that, we know who's been paid and who isn't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/Video_Katherine_Harris_claims_a_wave_0831.html  |title=Video: Katherine Harris claims 'a wave of support' for Senate bid |date=August 31, 2006 |work=The Raw Story |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127062150/http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/Video_Katherine_Harris_claims_a_wave_0831.html |archivedate=November 27, 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lack of Republican support====
The ''[[Pensacola News Journal]]'' suggested that Harris might withdraw from the Senate race after winning a primary victory, thereby allowing the Republicans to nominate another candidate, such as [[Tom Gallagher]], to run against [[Bill Nelson (politician)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pensacolanewsjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060726/NEWS01/607260337/1006 |title=Harris win could pose bizarre twist.

In August, Katherine Harris touted political endorsements from fellow Republican lawmakers on her campaign web site. However, some of those cited claim that they never endorsed her. This conflict resulted in several Republican congressmen calling the Harris campaign to complain after the ''St. Petersburg Times'' notified them of the endorsements listed on Harris's Web site. A short time later, their names were removed without comment from Harris's Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/17/State/Backing_Harris_Her_li.shtml |title=Backing Harris?

Of Harris's three primary opponents, only Will McBride endorsed her candidacy for the general election. In the first few days after the primary, a number of Republican nominees such as [[Charlie Crist]] and [[Tom Lee (politician)|Tom Lee]] went on a statewide unity tour with Gov. Bush. Harris was not invited; Republicans said the tour was only for nominees to statewide offices. Harris claimed Bush would campaign with her sometime in the two months before the election, but the governor's office denied this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-09-09/news/HARRIS09_1_1_katherine-harris-todd-harris-jeb-bush | title=Harris, GOP differ on Jeb Bush commitment | author=Stratton, Jim |author2=Sashin, Daphne |date=September 9, 2006 |work=Orlando Sentinel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810202258/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2006-09-09/news/HARRIS09_1_1_katherine-harris-todd-harris-jeb-bush |archivedate=August 10, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Bush did not make public appearances or private meetings with Harris before the primary. He did, however, appear with her at a fundraiser on September 21 in Tampa.

When it came time for newspapers to make their op-ed endorsements, all 22 of Florida's major daily newspapers supported Senator Nelson. The only endorsement Harris received was from the ''[[Polk County Democrat]]'', a newspaper in [[Bartow, Florida|Bartow]] which publishes four days out of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/katherine_harris_0-22_in_florida_newspaper_endorsements/| title=Katherine Harris 0–22 in Florida Newspaper Endorsements | author=Joyner, James |date=October 30, 2006 |publisher=Outside the Beltway |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620092219/http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/katherine_harris_0-22_in_florida_newspaper_endorsements |archivedate=June 20, 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious convictions====
Harris was a headline speaker at the [[Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church]]'s "Reclaiming America for Christ" conference held in Ft. Lauderdale on March 17–18, 2006. The conference web site invited attendees to attend in order to "reclaim this nation for Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reclaimamerica.org/PAGES/CONFERENCES/RAC2006/default.asp |title=Coral Ridge Ministries |publisher=Reclaimamerica.org |accessdate=March 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318033722/http://www.reclaimamerica.org/PAGES/CONFERENCES/RAC2006/default.asp |archivedate=March 18, 2006 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated mission of ReclaimAmerica.org is "To inform, equip, motivate, and support Christians; enabling them to defend and implement the Biblical principles on which our country was founded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reclaimamerica.org/pages/aboutus.aspx |title=Coral Ridge Ministries |publisher=Reclaimamerica.org |accessdate=March 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213180002/http://www.reclaimamerica.org/pages/aboutus.aspx |archivedate=February 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of her speech, Harris urged conferees to "win back America for God." Her appearance was noted in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article covering the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/7235393/the_crusaders/ |author=Moser, Bob |date=April 7, 2005 |title=The Crusaders |work=Rolling Stone |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318185336/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/7235393/the_crusaders/ |archivedate=March 18, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the ''Florida Baptist Witness'' on August 24, 2006, Harris called for Christians to vote on religious lines. She said,

{{quote|We have to have the faithful in government and over time, that lie we have been told, the [[separation of church and state]], people have internalized, thinking that they needed to avoid politics and that is so wrong because God is the one who chooses our rulers. And if we are the ones not actively involved in electing those godly men and women and if people aren't involved in helping godly men in getting elected then we're going to have a nation of secular laws. That's not what our [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers]] intended and that's certainly isn't what God intended. ... we need to take back this country. ... And if we don't get involved as Christians then how could we possibly take this back? ... If you are not electing Christians, tried and true, under public scrutiny and pressure, if you're not electing Christians then in essence you are going to legislate sin. They can legislate sin. They can say that abortion is alright. They can vote to sustain [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|gay marriage]]. And that will take western civilization, indeed other nations because people look to our country as one nation as under God and whenever we legislate sin and we say abortion is permissible and we say gay unions are permissible, then average citizens who are not Christians, because they don't know better, we are leading them astray and it's wrong.&lt;ref name="floridabaptist"&gt;{{cite news| publisher=Florida Baptist Witness|url=http://gofbw.com/news.asp?ID=6298 | title=Katherine Harris|date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=January 9, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107022628/http://www.floridabaptistwitness.com/6298.article &lt;!-- original location --&gt; |archivedate=January 7, 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rep.

There are people of other faiths and backgrounds of outstanding integrity who know how to tell the truth." [[Real estate developer]] [[Peter Monroe]], another GOP primary opponent, called on her to quit the race and resign from Congress. He called her suggestion that non-Christian voters are ignorant of morality when voting as "contemptible, arrogant and wicked."&lt;ref name="Marus"&gt;{{cite news|title=Katherine Harris tries to quell furor over remarks in Baptist newspaper| author=Marus, Robert | date=August 28, 2006|url=http://www.abpnews.com/archives/item/1440-katherine-harris-tries-to-quell-furor-over-remarks-in-baptist-newspaper |accessdate=January 9, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029040211/http://www.abpnews.com/1327.article &lt;!-- original location --&gt; |archivedate=October 29, 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 2006, Harris's campaign released a "Statement of Clarification", that stated, "In the interview, Harris was speaking to a Christian audience, addressing a common misperception that people of faith should not be actively involved in government. Addressing this Christian publication, Harris provided a statement that explains her deep grounding in [[Judeo-Christian]] values."&lt;ref name="Marus"/&gt; The press release went on to mention her past support of [[Israel]] and quoted her Jewish campaign manager [[Bryan G. Rudnick]], who stated "As the grandson of [[Holocaust]] survivors, I know that she encourages people of all faiths to engage in government so that our country can continue to thrive on the principles set forth by our founding fathers, without malice towards anyone."&lt;ref name="Marus"/&gt; At an appearance at an [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] gun show that same day, she said "it breaks my heart" to think people understood her comments as bigoted. When asked if she thought the Founding Fathers intended the nation to have secular laws she replied, 

{{quote|I think that our laws, I mean, I look at how the law originated, even from [[Moses]], the [[Ten Commandments]]. And I don't believe, that uh. ... That's how all of our laws originated in the United States, period. I think that's the basis of our rule of law.&lt;ref name="Marus"/&gt;}}

On October 3, 2006, Harris participated in a prayer service via phone call. In one instance, she called for the elimination of the separation of church and state when she said,

{{quote|Treat the pastors' hearts so that those who think there's no place for government, have them understand kingdom government, and how they need to be involved in the governance on this earth because God is our governance.}}

Harris then went on and prayed for Jews to be converted to Christianity.

{{quote|And Father God, right now on the day after the Jewish new year, Father, after the day after atonement, as they enter into their new year, Father God, I just pray that you would bring the hearts and minds of our Jewish brothers and sisters into alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/MGBNSMYJ3UE.html |work=Tampa Tribune |title=Harris' Prayer Call Stirs Concerns |author=March, William |date=November 4, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126055759/http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/MGBNSMYJ3UE.html |archivedate=November 26, 2007 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wonkette.com/212673/katherine-harris-prays-for-the-realignment-of-the-chosen-people |title=Katherine Harris Prays For the Realignment of the Chosen People |author=Pareene, Alex |publisher=wonkette.com |date=November 6, 2006 |accessdate=March 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517194327/http://wonkette.com/212673/katherine-harris-prays-for-the-realignment-of-the-chosen-people |archivedate=May 17, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Replacements in the 13th Congressional District====
[[Vern Buchanan]] was the Republican nominee and [[Christine Jennings]] the Democratic nominee to replace Harris in the [[United States House elections, 2006#Florida|2006 election]]. The race had been ranked as "leaning Democratic" by [[CQ Politics]], but Buchanan scored a very narrow victory, winning the election by a few hundred votes.

==Political positions and voting record==
Harris is a conservative on most issues. She is [[pro-life]] and has voted against [[embryonic stem cell research]]. She opposes oil-drilling in Florida's coastal waters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Harris supported reforming [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] to include private accounts. She has voted in favor of granting legal status to [[fetus]]es via the [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]]. She supports [[tax cuts]] and the [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act]], which restricts bankruptcy filings by consumers. Harris is also in favor of [[welfare reform]], [[school vouchers]], the [[Patriot Act]], the [[Flag Desecration Amendment]], the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.issues2002.org/Senate/Katherine_Harris.htm |title=Katherine Harris Voting Record |publisher=issues2002.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629015612/http://issues2002.org/Senate/Katherine_Harris.htm |archivedate=June 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a televised debate with Nelson on November 1, however, she repeatedly declined to say whether she would still support the [[Iraq Resolution|Iraq War Resolution]] knowing that [[Iraq]] did not have [[weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hoar, Jennifer |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/02/politics/main2146464.shtml |title=Harris Pressed On WMD Issue In Fla.

Harris responded that "we know we don't want to have arms going to the rogue nations like China."&lt;ref name="Nelson and Harris Senatorial Debate"&gt;{{cite web |title=Katherine Harris during the debate |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipk1GzEYuHU |accessdate=October 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kapitan China Kee Kim Swee''' (or Kee Kim Sui, also known as Kee Abdullah after he converted to Islam) was one of the prominent and important Chinese nationality ([[Hainanese]]) who settled in [[Tawau]], [[Sabah]]. He was appointed as the first customs examiner and revenue collector by the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company in Tawau, 1894. A year later, Tawau development was entrusted to his hands by the British administration. He became the first ''Pengulu'' or ''Orang Kaya'' (OKK) in Tawau, Sabah. Tawau (also known as Tanjung) became a modern town under Kee Kim Swee's lead, as he engineered Tawau into a  business and commercial area in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Bernama [http://thestar.com.my/metro/story.asp?file=/2008/9/25/southneast/2093010&amp;sec=southneast], "The Star", Thursday, 25 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After he died, his son OKK Kee Abu Bakar became his successor as the ''Penghulu''.

==Early life and career==

Kee Abdullah (Kee Kim Swee) was born in 1863. Little is known about his biological mother. He had a step-parent known by the name Kipas, a Dusun Tidong woman from Brunei.

In 1883, at the age of 20 years, as the courteous and respected Agent of the Company in Brunei, [[Kapitan Cina|Kapitan]] Kee Kim Swee was appointed as Datuk Temenggung over the Chinese community by [[Abdul Momin|Sultan Abdul Momin]].&lt;ref&gt;Sabah State Archive, "The North Borneo Herald" 1 July 1883.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, while on a trading journey with his father to Sandakan, their [[Tongkang]] boat encountered a mishap and capsized at the Marudu Bay. His father of Hainanese origin died in the incident and was buried in a Chinese cemetery in the district of [[Kudat]], Sabah. Kee Kim Swee survived and was rescued by villagers. He settled in the residence of a Suluk man named Dato Husin until his recovery.

In 1894, Kee Kim Swee was recruited by the British North Borneo Chartered Company as a customs examiner and revenue collector in Tawau. One of his many tasks was to collect a one-dollar [[Tax per head|poll tax]] from the residents. His unique ability to converse in Arabic, and also Jawi literate, served as a link between the native and Chinese groups with the government. Thus, he was often called upon for his view and to provide representation.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, Nicholas. "Under the Borneo Sun : A Tawau Story". [[Natural History Publications (Borneo)|Natural History Publication Borneo]], 2005. {{ISBN|983-812-108-8}}, {{ISBN|983-812-108-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

He converted to Islam when he married a Mindanao girl of Sulu Parang Tapol, Jumaatiah Ame Maidin, and later changed his name into Kee Abdullah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com.my/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=+Kee+Kim+Swee&amp;btnG=#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Kee+Kim+Swee%2C+a+Sino-Dusun+born&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=Kee+Kim+Swee%2C+a+Sino-Dusun+born&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=11234l11234l0l12132l1l1l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0&amp;fp=efdbfb56a135dd13&amp;biw=1138&amp;bih=555 Malaysian Chinese and Nation-building: Historical background and economic perspective, Hua she yan jiu zhong xin]&lt;/ref&gt;  His marriage with Jumaatiah gave him 18 children, 13 boys and 5 girls.

His children with Jumaatiah Ame Maidin:

* Kee Sulaiman (1897–1977)
* Kee Othman (1898–1970)
* OKK Kee Abu Bakar (1899–1953)
* Kee Abdul Aziz (unknown)

Some of the children's names were not recorded.

'''Helene Bertha Amalie''' "'''Leni'''" '''Riefenstahl''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁiːfn̩ʃtaːl|lang}}; 22 August 1902 – 8 September 2003) was a [[Germans|German]] film director, producer, screenwriter, editor, photographer, actress and dancer.

Born in 1902, Leni Riefenstahl grew up in [[Germany]] with her brother Heinz (1905–1944), who was killed on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in [[World War II]]. A talented swimmer and artist, she also became interested in dancing during her childhood, taking dancing lessons and performing across Europe.

After seeing a promotional poster for the 1924 film ''[[Mountain of Destiny|Der Berg des Schicksals]]'' ("The Mountain of Destiny"), Riefenstahl was inspired to move into acting. Between 1925 and 1929, she starred in five successful motion pictures. In 1932, Riefenstahl decided to try directing with her own film called ''[[Das Blaue Licht]]'' ("The Blue Light").

In the 1930s, she directed ''[[Triumph des Willens]]'' ("Triumph of the Will") and ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'', resulting in worldwide attention and acclaim. The movies are widely considered two of the most effective, and technically innovative, [[propaganda film]]s ever made. Her involvement in ''Triumph des Willens'', however, significantly damaged her career and reputation after the war. The exact nature of her relationship with [[Nazi Party]] leader [[Adolf Hitler]] remains a matter of debate. However, Hitler was in close collaboration with Riefenstahl during the production of at least three important Nazi films, and a closer friendship is claimed to have existed.{{sfn|Downing|2012|p=23}} When in 2000 [[Jodie Foster]] was planning a biographical drama on Riefenstahl, war-crime documenters warned against a revisionist view that glorified the director. They stated that publicly Riefenstahl seemed "quite infatuated" with Hitler and was in fact the last surviving member of his "inner circle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Simon|title=Jodie Foster film about Hitler aide angers Jews|issue=1959|publisher=Daily Telegraph (London)|date=5 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others go further, arguing that Riefenstahl's visions were essential to the success of [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scheinberg|first1=Robert|title=Award to German filmmaker spurs debate on her role as propagandist|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/cultureshock/provocations/leni/3.html|website=JTA News|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate=27 February 2017|date=4 September 1997|quote=‘Without the Riefenstahls of the world in the 1930s, the Shoah might not have happened. I would consider her an unindicted co-conspirator.’ (Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Riefenstahl was arrested, but classified as being a "[[fellow traveler]]" or "Nazi sympathiser" only and was not associated with [[war crimes]]. Throughout her life, she denied having known about the Holocaust. Besides directing, Riefenstahl released an autobiography and wrote several books on the [[Nuba peoples|Nuba people]].

Riefenstahl died of cancer on 8 September 2003 at the age of 101 and was buried at [[Munich Waldfriedhof]].

==Early life==
Helene Bertha Amalie Riefenstahl was born in Germany on 22 August 1902.{{sfn|Johnson 2014}} Her father, Alfred Theodor Paul Riefenstahl,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ql_FeGlS2oIC&amp;pg=PT20&amp;lpg=PT20&amp;dq=%22Alfred+Theodor+Paul+Riefenstahl%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jvAdeXydbU&amp;sig=Aygc6sU204B2JB440-8qhno9eKs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiuuIKq2LrLAhXjmoMKHXpSCaoQ6AEIEzAA]&lt;/ref&gt; owned a successful heating and ventilation company and wanted his daughter to follow him into the business world.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Since Riefenstahl was the only child for several years, Alfred wanted her to carry on the family name and secure the family fortune.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} However, her mother, Bertha Ida (Scherlach), who had been a part-time seamstress before her marriage, had faith in Riefenstahl and believed that her daughter's future was in show business.{{sfn|Trimborn 2007}}{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Riefenstahl had a younger brother, Heinz, who was killed at the age of 39 on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in [[Nazi Germany]]'s war against the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Rother|2003|p=112}}

Riefenstahl fell in love with the arts in her childhood.{{sfn|Salkeld|2011|p=2}} She began to paint and write poetry at the age of four.{{sfn|Salkeld|2011|p=2}} She was also athletic, and at the age of twelve joined a gymnastics and swimming club.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Her mother was confident her daughter would grow up to be successful in the field of art and therefore gave her full support, unlike Riefenstahl's father, who was not interested in his daughter's artistic inclinations.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} In 1918, when she was 16, Riefenstahl attended a presentation of [[Snow White]] which interested her deeply; it led her to want to be a dancer.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Her father instead wanted to provide his daughter with an education that could lead to a more dignified occupation. His wife, however, continued to support her daughter's passion.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Without her father's knowledge, she enrolled Riefenstahl in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}}

==Dancing and acting careers==
Riefenstahl attended dancing academies and became well known for her self-styled interpretive dancing skills, traveling across Europe with [[Max Reinhardt]] in a show funded by Jewish producer [[Harry R. Sokal|Harry Sokal]].{{sfn|Falcon 2003}}{{sfn|Infield|1976|pp=14–16}} Riefenstahl often made almost 700 ''[[Reichmark]]s'' for each performance and was so dedicated to dancing that she gave filmmaking no thought.{{sfn|Infield|1976|pp=14–16}} She began to suffer a series of foot injuries that led to knee surgery that threatened her dancing career.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} It was while going to a doctor's appointment that she first saw a poster for the 1924 film ''[[Mountain of Destiny|Der Berg des Schicksals]]'' ("The Mountain of Destiny").{{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} She became inspired to go into movie making, and began visiting the cinema to see films and also attended film shows.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}}

[[File:Leni-Riefenstahl - Profile.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Riefenstahl 1933 in ''[[SOS Eisberg]]'']]

On one of her adventures, Riefenstahl met Luis Trenker, who was an actor from ''Der Berg des Schicksals''.{{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} At a meeting arranged by her friend Gunther Rahn, she met [[Arnold Fanck]], the director of ''Der Berg des Schicksals'' and a pioneer of the [[mountain film]] genre.{{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} Fanck was working on a film in Berlin. After Riefenstahl told him how much she admired his work, she also convinced him of her acting skill.{{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} She persuaded him to feature her in one of his movies.{{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} Riefenstahl later received a package from Fanck containing the script of the 1926 film ''Der Heilige Berg'' ("The Holy Mountain").{{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} She made a series of films for Fanck, where she learned from him acting and film editing techniques.{{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} One of Fanck's films that brought Riefenstahl into the limelight was ''[[The White Hell of Pitz Palu (1929 film)|Die Weisse Hölle vom Piz Palü]]'' ("The White Hell of [[Piz Palü]]") of 1929, co-directed by [[G. W. Pabst]].{{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} Her fame spread to countries outside Germany.{{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}}{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}}

Riefenstahl produced and directed her own work called ''[[The Blue Light (1932 film)|Das Blaue Licht]]'' ("The Blue Light") in 1932, co-written by [[Carl Mayer]] and [[Béla Balázs]].{{sfn|Langford|2012|p=77}} This film won the Silver Medal at the [[Venice Film Festival]], but was not universally well-received, for which Riefenstahl blamed the critics, many of whom were Jewish.{{sfn|James 2007}}{{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=19}} Upon its 1938 re-release, the names of Balázs and Sokal, both Jewish, were removed from the credits; some reports claim this was at Riefenstahl's behest.{{sfn|James 2007}} In the film, Riefenstahl played an innocent peasant girl who is hated by the villagers because they think she is diabolic and cast out.{{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} She is protected by a glowing mountain grotto.{{sfn|Langford|2012|p=20}} According to herself, Riefenstahl received invitations to travel to Hollywood to create films, but she refused them in favour of remaining in Germany with a boyfriend.{{sfn|Müller 1999}} The film attracted the attention of Hitler, who believed she epitomized the perfect German female.{{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=19}} He saw talent in Riefenstahl and arranged a meeting.{{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=19}}

In 1933, Riefenstahl appeared in the U.S.-German co-productions of the [[Arnold Fanck]]-directed, German-language ''[[SOS Eisberg]]'' and the [[Tay Garnett]]-directed, English-language ''S.O.S. Iceberg''. The movies were filmed simultaneously in English and German and produced and distributed by [[Universal Studios]]. Her role as an actress in ''S.O.S. Iceberg'' was her only English language role in film.{{sfn|Salkeld|2001|pp=14–16}}

==Directing career==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 152-42-31, Nürnberg, Leni Riefenstahl mit Heinrich Himmler.jpg|thumb|325px|Riefenstahl stands near [[Heinrich Himmler]] while instructing her camera crew at [[Nuremberg]], 1934]]
===Propaganda films===

Riefenstahl heard [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) leader [[Adolf Hitler]] speak at a rally in 1932 and was mesmerized by his talent as a public speaker.{{sfn|Downing|2012|p=23}} Describing the experience in her memoir, Riefenstahl wrote, "I had an almost apocalyptic vision that I was never able to forget. It seemed as if the Earth's surface were spreading out in front of me, like a hemisphere that suddenly splits apart in the middle, spewing out an enormous jet of water, so powerful that it touched the sky and shook the earth".{{sfn|Downing|2012|p=23}}

Riefenstahl eventually came to the notice of Hitler who was immediately captivated by her work. She is described as fitting in with Hitler’s ideal of Aryan womanhood, a feature he had noted when he saw her starring performance in ''Das Blaue Licht.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Idols of Modernity: Movie Stars of the 1920s|last=Petro|first=Patrice|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2010|isbn=0813547326|location=|pages=278}}&lt;/ref&gt; After meeting Hitler, Riefenstahl was offered the opportunity to direct ''[[Der Sieg des Glaubens]]'' ("The Victory of Faith"), an hour-long propaganda film about the fifth [[Nuremberg Rally]] in 1933.{{sfn|Downing|2012|p=23}} The opportunity that was offered was a huge surprise to Riefenstahl. Hitler had ordered Goebbels Propaganda Ministry to give the film commission to Riefenstahl, but the Ministry had never informed her.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Films of Leni Riefenstahl|last=Hinton|first=David|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=1978|isbn=0-8108-1141-3|location=Metuchen, NJ and London|pages=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riefenstahl agreed to direct the movie even though she was only given a few days before the rally to prepare.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She and Hitler got on well, forming a friendly relationship.{{sfn|Downing|2012|p=23}} The propaganda film was funded entirely by the NSDAP.{{sfn|Downing|2012|p=23}}

During the filming of ''Victory of Faith,'' Hitler had stood side by side with the leader of the [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) [[Ernst Röhm]], a man with whom he clearly had a close working relationship. Röhm was ruthlessly murdered on Hitler's orders a short time later during the purge of the SA referred to as the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. It has gone on record that, immediately following the killings, Hitler subsequently ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed, although Riefenstahl disputes that this ever happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Leni Riefenstahl – A Memoir|last=Riefenstahl|first=Leni|publisher=Picador|year=1987|isbn=0-312-11926-7|location=New York|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still impressed with Riefenstahl's work, Hitler asked her to film ''[[Triumph des Willens]]'' ("Triumph of the Will"), a new propaganda film about the 1934 party rally in Nuremberg.{{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=20}} More than one million Germans participated in the rally.{{sfn|The History Place 2001}} Initially, according to Riefenstahl, she resisted and did not want to create further Nazi Party films, instead wanting to direct a feature film based on [[Eugen d'Albert]]'s ''[[Tiefland (opera)|Tiefland]]'' ("Lowlands"), an opera that was extremely popular in Berlin in the 1920s.{{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=20}} Riefenstahl received private funding for the production of ''Tiefland'', but the filming in Spain was derailed and the project was cancelled.{{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=20}} Hitler was able to convince her to film ''Triumph des Willens'' on the condition that she would not be required to make further films for the party, according to Riefenstahl.{{sfn|Hinton|2000|pp=21–22}} The motion picture was generally recognized as an epic, innovative work of [[propaganda]] filmmaking.{{sfn|Hinton|2000|pp=21–22}} The film took Riefenstahl's career to a new level and gave her further international recognition.{{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=21}}

In interviews for the 1993 documentary ''[[The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl]]'', Riefenstahl adamantly denied any deliberate attempt to create [[Nazi propaganda]] and said she was disgusted that ''Triumph des Willens'' was used in such a way.{{sfn|Müller 1999}}

Despite allegedly vowing not to make any more films about the Nazi Party, Riefenstahl made the 28-minute ''[[Tag der Freiheit: Unsere Wehrmacht]]'' ("Day of Freedom: Our Armed Forces") about the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] in 1935.{{sfn|Rother|2003|p=238}} Like ''Der Sieg des Glaubens'' and ''Triumph des Willens'', this was filmed at the annual Nazi Party rally at Nuremberg.{{sfn|Rother|2003|p=238}} Riefenstahl said this film was a sub-set of ''Der Sieg des Glaubens'', added to mollify the German Army which felt it was not represented well in ''Triumph des Willens''.{{sfn|Aitken|2013|p=760}}

Hitler invited Riefenstahl to film the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] scheduled to be held in Berlin, a film which Riefenstahl claimed had been commissioned by the [[International Olympic Committee]].{{sfn|Tomlinson|2012|pp=74–76}} She visited Greece to take footage of the route of the [[1936 Summer Olympics torch relay|inaugural torch relay]] and the games' original site at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], where she was aided by Greek photographer [[Nelly's]].{{sfn|Tomlinson|2012|pp=74–76}} This material became ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'', a hugely successful film which has since been widely noted for its technical and aesthetic achievements.{{sfn|Tomlinson|2012|pp=74–76}} She was one of the first filmmakers to use [[tracking shot]]s in a documentary,{{sfn|Andrew|1999|pp=183–184}} placing a camera on rails to follow the athletes' movement. The film is also noted for its slow motion shots.{{sfn|Andrew|1999|pp=183–184}} Riefenstahl played with the idea of slow motion, underwater diving shots, extremely high and low shooting angles, panoramic aerial shots, and tracking system shots for allowing fast action. Many of these shots were relatively unheard of at the time, but Leni’s use and augmentation of them set a standard, and is the reason why they are still used to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leni Riefenstahl|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/lriefenstahl.html|website=Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riefenstahl's work on ''Olympia'' has been cited as a major influence in modern sports photography.{{sfn|Tomlinson|2012|pp=74–76}}{{sfn|Andrew|1999|pp=183–184}} Riefenstahl filmed competitors of all races, including African-American [[Jesse Owens]] in what later became famous footage.{{sfn|Edmondson|2007|p=72}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S34639, Joseph Goebbels und Leni Riefenstahl crop.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Riefenstahl in conversation with Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]], 1937]]
''Olympia'' premiered for Hitler's 49th birthday in 1938. Its international debut led Riefenstahl to embark on an American publicity tour in an attempt to secure commercial release.{{sfn|F-R Publishing Corporation 2007}} In February 1937, Riefenstahl enthusiastically told a reporter for the ''[[Detroit News]]'', "To me, Hitler is the greatest man who ever lived. He truly is without fault, so simple and at the same time possessed of masculine strength".{{sfn|Rollyson 2007}} She arrived in New York City on 4 November 1938, five days before ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (the "Night of the Broken Glass").{{sfn|Graham 1993}} When news of the event reached the United States,{{sfn|Graham 1993}} Riefenstahl publicly defended Hitler.{{sfn|Graham 1993}} On 18 November, she was received by [[Henry Ford]] in Detroit. ''Olympia'' was shown at the Chicago Engineers Club two days later.{{sfn|Graham 1993}} [[Avery Brundage]], President of the International Olympic Committee, praised the film and held Riefenstahl in the highest regard.{{sfn|Bernstein|2013|p=111}} She negotiated with [[Louis B. Mayer]], and on 8 December, [[Walt Disney]] brought her on a three-hour tour showing her the ongoing production of ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.{{sfn|Graham 1993}}

From the ''[[Goebbels Diaries]]'', researchers learned that Riefenstahl had been friendly with [[Joseph Goebbels]] and his wife [[Magda Goebbels|Magda]], attending the opera with them and going to his parties.{{sfn|Rollyson 2007}} Riefenstahl maintained that Goebbels was upset when she rejected his advances and was jealous of her influence on Hitler, seeing her as an internal threat.{{sfn|James 2007}} She therefore insisted his diary entries could not be trusted.{{sfn|James 2007}} By later accounts, Goebbels thought highly of Riefenstahl's filmmaking but was angered with what he saw as her overspending on the Nazi-provided filmmaking budgets.{{sfn|James 2007}}

===Iconography===

In ''Triumph of the Will,'' Tom Saunders argues that Hitler serves as the object of the camera's gaze. Saunders writes, "Without denying that “rampant masculinity” (the “sexiness” of Hitler and the SS) serves as the object of the gaze, I would suggest that desire is also directed toward the feminine. This occurs not in the familiar sequences of adoring women greeting Hitler’s arrival and cavalcade through Nuremberg. In these Hitler clearly remains the focus of attraction, as more generally in the visual treatment of his mass following. Rather, it is encoded in representation of flags and banners, which were shot in such a way as to make them visually desirable as well as potent political symbols" ("Filming the Nazi Flag: Leni Riefenstahl and the Cinema of National Arousal," 25). The flag serves as a symbol of masculinity, equated with national pride and dominance, that channels men's sexual and masculine energy. Riefenstahl's cinematic framing of the flags encapsulated its iconography. Saunders continues, "The effect is a significant double transformation: the images mechanize human beings and breathe life into flags. Even when the carriers are not mostly submerged under the sea of colored cloth, and when facial features are visible in profile, they attain neither character nor distinctiveness. The men remain ants in a vast enterprise. By contrast and paradoxically, the flags, whether a few or hundreds peopling the frame, assume distinct identities" (29).

===Use of music===
Riefenstahl distorts the [[diegetic]] sound in ''Triumph of the Will.'' Her distortion of sound suggests she was influenced by German art cinema. Influenced by Classical Hollywood cinema's style, German art film employed music to enhance the narrative, establish a sense of grandeur, and to heighten the emotions in a scene. In ''Triumph of the Will,'' Riefenstahl used traditional folk music to accompany and intensify her shots. Ben Morgan comments on Riefenstahl's distortion of sound, “In ''Triumph of the Will'', the material world leaves no aural impression beyond the music. Where the film does combine diegetic noise with the music, the effects used are human (laughter or cheering) and offer a rhythmic extension to the music rather than a contrast to it. By replacing diegetic sound, Riefenstahl’s film employs music to combine the documentary with the fantastic,” ("Music in Nazi Film: How Different is ''Triumph of the Will?"'' The music substitutes for the live sound of the event and functions to convey the meaning of her shots. The accompanied music conveys the meaning behind the images, that of national pride.

===World War II===
When [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, Riefenstahl was photographed in Poland wearing a military uniform and a pistol on her belt in the company of German soldiers; she had gone to Poland as a war correspondent.{{sfn|Robert 2013}}{{sfn|James 2007}} On 12 September, she was in the town of [[Końskie]] when 30 civilians were executed in retaliation for an alleged attack on German soldiers.{{sfn|Harris 2007}} According to her [[memoir]], Riefenstahl tried to intervene but a furious German soldier held her at gunpoint and threatened to shoot her on the spot.{{sfn|James 2007}} She claimed she did not realize the victims were Jews.{{sfn|James 2007}} Photographs of a potentially distraught Riefenstahl survive from that day.{{sfn|James 2007}} Nevertheless, by 5 October 1939, Riefenstahl was back in [[History of Poland (1939–45)|occupied Poland]] filming Hitler's [[Invasion of Poland#Aftermath|victory parade in Warsaw]].{{sfn|Harris 2007}} Afterwards, she left Poland and chose not to make any more Nazi-related movies.{{sfn|Moore 2003}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2004-0021, Polen, Truppenbesuch von Leni Riefenstahl.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Riefenstahl as a war correspondent in Poland, 1939]]

On 14 June 1940, the day Paris was declared an [[open city]] by the French and occupied by German troops, Riefenstahl wrote to Hitler in a [[telegram]], "With indescribable joy, deeply moved and filled with burning gratitude, we share with you, my Führer, your and Germany's greatest victory, the entry of German troops into Paris. You exceed anything human imagination has the power to conceive, achieving deeds without parallel in the history of mankind. How can we ever thank you?"{{sfn|Harris 2007}} She later explained, "Everyone thought the war was over, and in that spirit I sent the cable to Hitler".{{sfn|Riding 2003}} Riefenstahl was friends with Hitler for 12 years and reports vary as to whether she ever had an intimate relationship with him.{{sfn|Mathews}} Her relationship with Hitler severely declined in 1944 after her brother died on the Russian Front.{{sfn|Moore 2003}}

After the Nuremberg rallies trilogy and ''Olympia'', Riefenstahl began work on the movie she had tried and failed to direct once before, namely ''Tiefland''.{{sfn|Kenrick|2006|p=197}}{{sfn|Trimborn 2007}} On Hitler's direct order, the [[Government of Nazi Germany|German government]] paid her seven million ''Reichsmarks'' in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://riefenstahl.askdefinebeta.com/ "Helene Bertha Amalie "Leni" Riefenstahl (August 22 1902 – September 8 2003)"]&lt;/ref&gt; From 23 September until 13 November 1940, she filmed in [[Krün]] near [[Mittenwald]].{{sfn|Kenrick|2006|p=197}} The extras playing Spanish women and farmers were drawn from gypsies detained in a camp at [[Salzburg|Salzburg-Maxglan]] who were forced to work with her.{{sfn|Kenrick|2006|p=197}} Filming at the [[Babelsberg Studios]] near Berlin began 18 months later in April 1942.{{sfn|Kenrick|2006|p=197}} This time [[Sinti]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] people from the [[Marzahn]] detention camp near Berlin were compelled to work as extras.{{sfn|Kenrick|2006|p=197}} Almost to the end of her life, despite overwhelming evidence that the concentration camp occupants had been forced to work on the movie unpaid, Riefenstahl continued to maintain all the film extras survived and that she had met several of them after the war.{{sfn|Trimborn|2008|pp=206–208}}{{sfn|Mathews}} Riefenstahl sued filmmaker Nina Gladitz, who said Riefenstahl personally chose the extras at their holding camp; Gladitz had found one of the Gypsy survivors and matched his memory with stills of the movie for a documentary Gladitz was filming.{{sfn|Taylor 2007}} The German court ruled largely in favour of Gladitz, declaring that Riefenstahl had known the extras were from a concentration camp, but they also agreed that Riefenstahl had not been informed the Gypsies would be sent to [[Auschwitz]] after filming was completed.{{sfn|Taylor 2007}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2004-0020, Polen, Truppenbesuch von Leni Riefenstahl.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Riefenstahl instructing her film crew in Poland, 1939]]

This issue came up again in 2002, when Riefenstahl was one hundred years old and she was taken to court by a Roma group for denying the Nazis had exterminated gypsies.{{sfn|Connolly 2002}} Riefenstahl apologized and said, "I regret that Sinti and Roma [people] had to suffer during the period of National Socialism. It is known today that many of them were murdered in concentration camps".{{sfn|Connolly 2002}}

In October 1944 the production of ''Tiefland'' moved to [[Barrandov Studios]] in Prague for interior filming.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Lavish sets made these shots some of the most costly of the film.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} The film was not edited and released until almost ten years later.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}}

The last time Riefenstahl saw Hitler was when she married Peter Jacob on 21 March 1944.{{sfn|Riding 2003}} Riefenstahl and Jacob divorced in 1946.{{sfn|Heck-Rabi|1984|p=126}} As Germany's military situation became impossible by early 1945, Riefenstahl left Berlin and was [[hitchhiking]] with a group of men, trying to reach her mother, when she was taken into custody by American troops.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} She walked out of a holding camp, beginning a series of escapes and arrests across the chaotic landscape.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} At last making it back home on a bicycle, she found that American troops had seized her house.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} She was surprised by how kindly they treated her.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}}

===Thwarted film projects===
Most of Riefenstahl's unfinished projects were lost towards the end of the war.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} The French government confiscated all of her editing equipment, along with the production reels of ''Tiefland''.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} After years of legal wrangling, these were returned to her, but the French government had reportedly damaged some of the film stock whilst trying to develop and edit it, with a few key scenes being missing (although Riefenstahl was surprised to find the original negatives for ''Olympia'' in the same shipment).{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} She edited and dubbed the remaining material and ''Tiefland'' premiered on 11 February 1954 in [[Stuttgart]].{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} However, it was denied entry into the [[Cannes Film Festival]].{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Although Riefenstahl lived for almost another half century, ''Tiefland'' was her last feature film.{{sfn|BBC News 2005}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1988-106-29, Leni Riefenstahl bei Dreharbeiten.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Riefenstahl filming a difficult scene with the help of two assistants, 1936]]

Riefenstahl tried many times to make more films during the 1950s and 1960s, but was met with resistance, public protests and sharp criticism.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Many of her filmmaking peers in Hollywood had fled Nazi Germany and were unsympathetic to her.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Although both film professionals and investors were willing to support her work, most of the projects she attempted were stopped owing to ever-renewed and highly negative publicity about her past work for the Third Reich.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}}

In 1954, [[Jean Cocteau]], who greatly admired the film, insisted on ''Tiefland'' being shown at the Cannes Film Festival, which he was running that year.{{sfn|Falcon 2003}} In 1960, Riefenstahl attempted to prevent filmmaker [[Erwin Leiser]] from juxtaposing scenes from ''Triumph des Willens'' with footage from concentration camps in his film ''Mein Kampf''.{{sfn|Falcon 2003}} Riefenstahl had high hopes for a collaboration with Cocteau called ''Friedrich und Voltaire'' ("Friedrich and Voltaire"), wherein Cocteau was to play two roles.{{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=135}} They thought the film might symbolize the love-hate relationship between Germany and France.{{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=135}} Cocteau's illness and 1963 death put an end to the project.{{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=135}} A musical remake of ''Das Blaue Licht'' ("The Blue Light") with an English production company also fell apart.{{sfn|Hinton|2000|p=136}}

In the 1960s, Riefenstahl became interested in Africa from [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[Green Hills of Africa]]'' and from the photographs of [[George Rodger]].{{sfn|Rhiel|O'Sickey|Pages|2008|p=244}}{{sfn|Moore 2003}} She visited Kenya for the first time in 1956 and later Sudan, where she photographed [[Nuba peoples|Nuba]] tribes with whom she sporadically lived, learning about their culture so she could photograph them more easily.{{sfn|Rhiel|O'Sickey|Pages|2008|p=244}} Even though her film project about modern slavery entitled ''Die Schwarze Fracht'' ("The Black Cargo") was never completed, Riefenstahl was able to sell the stills from the expedition to magazines in various parts of the world.{{sfn|Rhiel|O'Sickey|Pages|2008|p=244}} While scouting shooting locations, she almost died from injuries received in a truck accident.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} After waking up from a coma in a [[Nairobi]] hospital, she finished writing the script, but was soon thoroughly thwarted by uncooperative locals, the [[Suez Crisis|Suez Canal crisis]] and bad weather.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} In the end, the film project was called off.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} Even so, Riefenstahl was granted [[Sudanese people|Sudanese]] citizenship for her services to the country, becoming the first foreigner to receive a Sudanese passport.{{sfn|Salkeld|2011|p=253}}

== Detention and trials ==
Novelist and sports writer [[Budd Schulberg]], assigned by the [[U.S. Navy]] to the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] for intelligence work while attached to [[John Ford]]'s documentary unit, was ordered to arrest Riefenstahl at her chalet in Kitzbühel, ostensibly to have her identify Nazi war criminals in German film footage captured by the Allied troops shortly after the war.{{sfn|Salkeld|2011|p=Chapter 17, pp. 1–3}} Riefenstahl claimed she was not aware of the nature of the internment camps.{{sfn|Kennicott 2005}} According to Schulberg, "She gave me the usual song and dance. She said, 'Of course, you know, I'm really so misunderstood. I'm not political'".{{sfn|Kennicott 2005}}

Riefenstahl claimed she was fascinated by the Nazis, but also politically naive, remaining ignorant about war crimes.{{sfn|The Scotsman 2012}} Throughout 1945 to 1948, she was held by various Allied-controlled prison camps across Germany.{{sfn|The Scotsman 2012}} She was also under house arrest for a period of time.{{sfn|The Scotsman 2012}} She was tried four times by postwar authorities for [[denazification]] and eventually found to be a "[[fellow traveller]]" (''[[Mitläufer]]'') who sympathised with the Nazis.{{sfn|The Scotsman 2012}}

Riefenstahl said that her biggest regret in life was meeting Hitler, declaring, "It was the biggest catastrophe of my life. Until the day I die people will keep saying, 'Leni is a Nazi', and I'll keep saying, 'But what did she do?'"{{sfn|The Scotsman 2012}} Even though she went on to win up to 50 libel cases, details about her relation to the Nazi party generally remain unclear.{{sfn|The Scotsman 2012}}

Shortly before she died, Riefenstahl voiced her final words on the subject of her connection to Adolf Hitler in a BBC interview:  "''I was one of millions who thought Hitler had all the answers. We saw only the good things; we didn’t know bad things were to come."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/986528.stm|title= The five lives of Leni Riefenstahl|publisher=BBC News|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa, photography, books and final film ==
Riefenstahl began a lifelong companionship with her cameraman Horst Kettner, who was 40 years her junior and assisted her with the photographs; they were together from the time she was 60 and he was 20.{{sfn|Corliss 2002}}

Riefenstahl's books with photographs of the Nuba tribes were published in 1974 and republished in 1976 as ''[[The Last of the Nuba|Die Nuba]]'' (translated as "The Last of the Nuba") and ''[[The People of Kau|Die Nuba von Kau]]'' ("The Nuba People of Kau"). While heralded by many as outstanding colour photographs, they were harshly criticized by [[Susan Sontag]], who claimed in a review that they were further evidence of Riefenstahl's "fascist aesthetics".{{sfn|Sontag 2007}} The Art Director's Club of Germany awarded Riefenstahl a gold medal for the best photographic achievement of 1975.{{sfn|Sontag 2007}}  She also sold some of the pictures to German magazines.{{sfn|University of Washington 2008}} She photographed the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]] in Munich, and rock star [[Mick Jagger]] along with his wife [[Bianca Jagger|Bianca]] for ''[[The Sunday Times]]''.{{sfn|Falcon 2003}} Years later, Riefenstahl photographed [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]] entertainers [[Siegfried &amp; Roy]].{{sfn|Leni Riefenstahl 2001}} She was guest of honour at the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympic Games]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lifetimetv.co.uk/biography/biography-leni-riefenstahl |title="Leni Riefenstahl Biography" |access-date=12 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702123352/http://lifetimetv.co.uk/biography/biography-leni-riefenstahl |archive-date=2 July 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Riefenstahl published a book of her sub-aquatic photographs called ''[[Korallengärten]]'' ("Coral Gardens"), followed by the 1990 book ''[[Wunder unter Wasser]]'' ("Wonder under Water").{{sfn|BBC News 2002}} In her 90s, Riefenstahl was still photographing marine life and gained the distinction of being one of the world's oldest scuba divers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://triblive.com/news/westmoreland/8891622-74/loughry-dive-scuba#axzz3lZ2BdQq0 "Salem Senior Loughry Could Be World's Oldest Female Scuba Diver"]&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 August 2002, her 100th birthday, she released the film ''[[Impressionen unter Wasser]]'' ("Underwater Impressions"), an idealized documentary of life in the oceans and her first film in over 25 years.{{sfn|Harris 2007}} Riefenstahl was a member of [[Greenpeace]] for eight years.{{sfn|Steinberg 2003}}

Riefenstahl survived a [[helicopter]] crash in Sudan in 2000 while trying to learn the fates of her Nuba friends during the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] and was airlifted to a Munich hospital where she received treatment for two broken ribs.{{sfn|BBC News 2001}}{{sfn|Moore 2003}}

===Death===
[[File:WP Leni Riefenstahl Grabstelle.jpg|thumb|right|Riefenstahl's grave in Munich Cemetery]]
Riefenstahl celebrated her 101st birthday on 22 August 2003 at a hotel in [[Feldafing]], on [[Lake Starnberg]], [[Bavaria]], near her home. The day after her birthday celebration, she became ill.{{sfn|Davis 2003}}

Riefenstahl had been suffering from cancer for some time, and her health rapidly deteriorated during the last weeks of her life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007410 "Leni Riefenstahl (Helene Riefenstahl)"]&lt;/ref&gt; Kettner said in an interview in 2002, "Ms. Riefenstahl is in great pain and she has become very weak and is taking painkillers".{{sfn|Fantz 2002}} Leni Riefenstahl died in her sleep at around 10:00 pm on 8 September 2003 at her home in [[Pöcking]], Germany.{{sfn|Rhiel|O'Sickey|Pages|2008|p=245}} After her death, there was a varied response in the obituary pages of leading publications, although most recognized her technical breakthroughs in film making.{{sfn|Moore 2003}}

==Reception==
Film scholar [[Mark Cousins (film critic)|Mark Cousins]] notes in his book ''[[Mark Cousins (film critic)#Career|The Story of Film]]'' that, "Next to [[Orson Welles]] and [[Alfred Hitchcock]], Leni Riefenstahl was the most technically talented Western film maker of her era".{{sfn|World Press Review 2014}}

When traveling to Hollywood, Riefenstahl would be criticized by the Anti-Nazi League very harshly when wanting to showcase her film ''Olympia'' soon after its release.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Cooper C. "'Olympia' in America, 1938 : Leni Riefenstahl, Hollywood, and the Kristallnacht." Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, no. 4, 1993, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewer Gary Morris called Riefenstahl, "An artist of unparalleled gifts, a woman in an industry dominated by men, one of the great formalists of the cinema on a par with [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] or [[Orson Welles|Welles]]".{{sfn|Morris 1999}}
[[File:Leni Riefenstahl on Time magazine 1936.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Riefenstahl on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 1936]]

Film critic Hal Erickson of ''[[The New York Times]]'' states that the "[[Jewish Question]]" is mainly unmentioned in ''Triumph des Willens''; "filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl prefers to concentrate on cheering crowds, precision marching, military bands, and Hitler's climactic speech, all orchestrated, choreographed and illuminated on a scale that makes Griffith and DeMille look like poverty-row directors".{{sfn|Erickson}}

Charles Moore of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote, "She was perhaps the most talented female cinema director of the 20th century; her celebration of Nazi Germany in film ensured that she was certainly the most infamous".{{sfn|Moore 2003}}

Film journalist Sandra Smith from ''[[The Independent]]'' remarked, "Opinions will be divided between those who see her as a young, talented and ambitious woman caught up in the tide of events which she did not fully understand, and those who believe her to be a cold and opportunist propagandist and a Nazi by association."{{sfn|Smith 2003}}

Critic Judith Thurman said in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that, "Riefenstahl's genius has rarely been questioned, even by critics who despise the service to which she lent it. Riefenstahl was a consummate stylist obsessed with bodies in motion, particularly those of dancers and athletes. Riefenstahl relies heavily for her transitions on portentous cutaways to clouds, mist, statuary, foliage, and rooftops. Her reaction shots have a tedious sameness: shining, ecstatic faces—nearly all young and Aryan, except for Hitler's".{{sfn|Thurman 2007}}

[[Pauline Kael]], also a film reviewer employed for ''The New Yorker'', called ''Triumph des Willens'' and ''Olympia'', "the two greatest films ever directed by a woman".{{sfn|Corliss 2002}}

Writer Richard Corliss wrote in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' that he was "impressed by Riefenstahl's standing as a total auteur: producer, writer, director, editor and, in the fiction films, actress. The issues her films and her career raise are as complex and they are important, and her vilifiers tend to reduce the argument to one of a director's complicity in atrocity or her criminal ignorance".{{sfn|Corliss 2002}}

==Film biographies==
In 1993, Riefenstahl was the subject of the award-winning German documentary film ''[[The Wonderful Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl|The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl]]'', directed by Ray Müller.{{sfn|Gale|2007|p=3276}} Riefenstahl appeared in the film and answered several questions and detailed the production of her films.{{sfn|Gale|2007|p=3276}}{{sfn|Ebert Ebert}} The biofilm was nominated for seven [[Emmy Award]]s, winning in one category.{{sfn|Gale|2007|p=3276}} Riefenstahl, who for some time had been working on her memoirs, decided to cooperate in the production of this documentary to tell her life story about the struggles she had gone through in her personal life, her film-making career and what people thought of her.{{sfn|Ebert Ebert}} She was also the subject of Müller's 2000 documentary film ''[[Leni Riefenstahl: Her Dream of Africa]]'', about her return to Sudan to visit the Nuba people.{{sfn|BBC News 2001}}

In April 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that British screenwriter Rupert Walters was writing a movie based on Riefenstahl's life which would star actress [[Jodie Foster]].{{sfn|Harris 2007}} The project did not receive Riefenstahl's approval prior to her death, as Riefenstahl asked for a veto on any scenes to which she did not agree.{{sfn|Harris 2007}} Riefenstahl reportedly wanted [[Sharon Stone]] to play her rather than Foster,{{sfn|Harris 2007}} which ultimately resulted in the cancellation of the project.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 2011, director [[Steven Soderbergh]] revealed that he had also been working on a biopic of Riefenstahl for about six months.{{sfn|Jagernauth 2011}} He eventually abandoned the project over concerns of its commercial prospects.{{sfn|Jagernauth 2011}}

==In popular culture==
Riefenstahl's filming merits are discussed between characters in the 2009 [[Quentin Tarantino]] film ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]''.{{sfn|Whipp 2009}}

Riefenstahl was portrayed by [[Zdena Studenková]] in ''Leni'', a 2014 Slovak drama play about her fictional participation in ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''.{{sfn|Slovenské Národné Divadlo 2014}}

Riefenstahl was portrayed by Dutch actress [[Carice van Houten]] in ''[[Race (2016 film)|Race]]'', a [[Sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Stephen Hopkins (director)|Stephen Hopkins]] about [[Jesse Owens]]. It was released in North America on February 19, 2016.{{sfn|Kit 2014}} To make her sympathetic portrayal acceptable to an American audience, the film dramatizes her quarrels with Goebbels over her direction of the film, ''Olympia'', especially about filming the African American star who is proving to be a politically embarrassing refutation of Nazi Germany's claims of Aryan athletic supremacy.

Riefenstahl was referred to in the series finale of the television show [[Weeds (tv series)|''Weeds'']] when Nancy questions Andy for naming his daughter after a Nazi to which he replied "she was a pioneer in film-making, I don't believe in holding grudges."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=weeds&amp;episode=s08e12 "Weeds Episode Scripts N/A – It's Time (Part 1)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 short film ''Leni. Leni.'', based on the play by Tom McNab and directed by Adrian Vitoria, [[Hildegard Neil]] portrays Riefenstahl&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wearemovingstories.com/we-are-moving-stories-videos/2016/5/20/cannes-short-film-corner-leni-leni|title=Cannes Short Film Corner – Leni|publisher=We are Moving Stories|access-date=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; preparing to give an interview in 1993. In her dressing room she is "visited" by herself as a young woman portrayed by Valeria Kozhevnikova at three stages/turning points in her life: as a dancer (1924), an actress (1929) and a director (1940).

The 2017 video game ''[[Wolfenstein: New Colossus]]'' (which takes place in an alternate 1961 where the Nazis won World War 2) features a supporting character heavily implied to be Leni Riefenstahl. Named Lady Helena, this female director is responsible for making the vast majority of the propaganda movies said to be playing (most notably a big budget movie detailing how America was "liberated" by Nazis). Lady Helena is later met face to face and she is seen to closely resemble Riefenstahl. It also revealed that her mysterious "producer" is an aging, delusional Adolf Hitler and that the two share a close working relationship.

Garlands of flowers presented by the American public greet Prime Minister Ali Khan and his wife.]]

The '''state visit of Liaquat Ali Khan to the United States''' from 3 May to 26 May 1950, was an official [[state visit]] paid by the [[List of Prime Ministers of Pakistan|first]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], [[Liaquat Ali Khan]], accompanied by the [[First Lady of Pakistan|First Lady]] of Pakistan, [[Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan|Sheila Irene Pant]].

Personal initiatives and invitation facilitated by the President of the United States, [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]], Prime Minister of Pakistan Ali Khan and First Lady of Pakistan [[Ra'ana Liaquat Ali Khan|Begum Ali Khan]], were received by the general [[Americans|American public]] when the [[Pakistan International Airlines|state airlines]] carrying the delegation landed at the [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport|New Orleans Airport]], [[New Orleans]], Louisiana.&lt;ref name="Jang English Services"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aziz|first=Qutubuddin|title=Special Edition:   Quaid-i-Millat's visit to the United States The foundation of friendship and economic co-operation|url=http://jang.com.pk/thenews/spedition/liaqat_ali_khan/page2.htm.html|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=Jang English Services|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906181345/http://www.jang.com.pk/thenews/spedition/liaqat_ali_khan/page2.htm.html|archivedate=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan|Ali Khan]]'s arrival, there was an official parade in the New York City in his honour, he was also conferred with an honorary degree by the [[Columbia University]]. During his visit, he also spoke at the [[US House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the [[lower house]] of the [[U.S. Congress|United States Congress]].&lt;ref name="The Friday Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff editor|title=Pakistan Chronicle's collection: Liaquat Ali Khan goes to the US (1950)|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=The Friday Times|url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/beta2/tft/article.php?issue=20110930&amp;page=30|date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At home front, Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan|Ali Khan]]'s trip to the United States was highly politicised and criticised by the [[Socialism in Pakistan|left–wing]] sphere who levelled its charges on ignoring the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]]'s invitation in favour of the United States.&lt;ref name="Dawn news foreign policy archives"&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff writer|title=The foreign policy of Liaquat Ali Khan|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/881096/the-foreign-policy-of-liaquat-ali-khan|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=Dawn news foreign policy archives|date=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Pakistan, Ali Khan spoke highly of his visit to the US but survived a [[Rawalpindi conspiracy|conspiracy hatched]] by the [[Socialism in Pakistan|left–wing]] sphere in 1951. According to the [[Pakistani English|English newspaper]], ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', Ali Khan's state visit and further reliance towards the United States became a permanent fixture of the [[Foreign policy of Pakistan|foreign policy]] of Pakistan during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Dawn News"&gt;{{cite news|last=Makhdumi|first=Umar M.|title=Liaquat Ali Khan's visit to US|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1003958/liaquat-ali-khan-s-visit-to-us|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=Dawn News|date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan President Truman.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Prime minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan|Ali Khan]] shakes hands with President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]], upon his arrival.]]
After the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of [[Pakistan]] in 1947, the United States was one of the first countries to recognise the new State of Pakistan as [[US Department of State]] had rushed the US Consul-General in [[Morocco]] to Karachi to represent the [[US government]] in the Pakistan's [[Independence Day (Pakistan)|Independence Day]] ceremony on [[Fourteenth of August|14 August 1947]] with a message of warm greetings and good wishes from the [[White House]].&lt;ref name="Jang English Services" /&gt;

The [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] of Pakistan in 1947 oversaw the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|first war]] over [[Kashmir]] region.&lt;ref name="Jang English Services" /&gt; During the war, [[Founder of Pakistan|Founder]] of Pakistan and [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]] [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] unsuccessfully asked the United States for [[United States dollar|$2&amp;nbsp;billion]] in military and financial aid but the US followed a policy of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]], rebuffing any requests made by Pakistan's government.&lt;ref name="Har-Anand Publications" /&gt; During this time, Pakistan's relations with the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]] remained to be fluctuated. In 1949, Indian Prime minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] paid the state visit to the United States, which eventually led Pakistan's government to cement relations with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="Har-Anand Publications" /&gt; Finally on 3 June 1949, Soviet Union sent an invitation to Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan|Ali Khan]] which came as a surprise to the United States.&lt;ref name="Har-Anand Publications" /&gt; With India's [[Role of India in Non-aligned movement|strict commitment]] towards the [[Non-aligned Movement]] (NAM) influenced the United States to send an invitation to Ali Khan in 1950.&lt;ref name="Har-Anand Publications" /&gt;

==Visit and aftermath==
[[File:Photograph of President Truman and Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan of Pakistan in Washington during the Prime... - NARA - 200197.jpg|250px|left|thumb|President Truman accompanies Prime Minister Ali Khan in Washington D.C.]]

In a reference written by Kalim Bahadur in his book ''Democracy in Pakistan: Crises and Conflicts'', Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan|Ali Khan]] quickly accepted the invitation and postponed his visit to Moscow.&lt;ref name="Har-Anand Publications"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bahadur|first=Kalim|title=Democracy in Pakistan : crises and conflicts|year=1998|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=8124100837|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ND9yNyTpntYC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=liaquat+ali+khan+visit+to+usa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KRsxU_zbBsjhyQHD34B4&amp;ved=0CDAQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=liaquat%20ali%20khan%20visit%20to%20usa&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 3 May 1950, Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan|Ali Khan]], the [[First Lady of Pakistan|First Lady]] of Pakistan, Begum Ali Khan and the large civic-military delegation arrived to the United States via United Kingdom and their [[Pakistan International|official flight]] landed at the [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport|New Orleans Airport]], [[New Orleans]], Louisiana.&lt;ref name="Greenwood Press"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graebner|first=M.

Truman|Harry Truman]]. Upon reaching New York City, President Truman organised a parade and accorded the red-carpet treatment to welcome Ali Khan and his family.&lt;ref name="Author House Public. Co."&gt;{{cite book|last=Goswami|first=Arvind|title=3 D Deceit, Duplicity &amp; Dissimulation of U.S. Foreign Policy towards India|year=2012|publisher=Author House Public.

Ali Khan gave a lecture on [[political science]] at [[Columbia University]], which conferred him with an honorary degree. Thereafter, he also engaged and spoke to the [[US House of Representatives]]. Speaking at the [[United States Congress]] session, Ali Khan highlighted the importance of Pakistan's geostrategic location, and the visit set the course of Pakistan's foreign policy: close ties with the United States and co-operation against a perceived threat from the USSR. Upon returning to Pakistan, he strongly defended his trip to the United States in a broadcast from [[Radio Pakistan]] on 30 June:
{{quote|This visit not only enabled me to see the American people and their wonderful country but also gave me an occasion to inform the inhabitants of that country about the birth of Pakistan, its short but eventful history and the Islamic way of life adopted as an ideal by the people of my country|sign=Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan, 1950|source=source&lt;ref name="Jang English Services" /&gt; }}

==Criticism and politicisation==
At home front, Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan|Ali Khan]] was highly politicised and criticised by the [[Socialism in Pakistan|left-wing sphere]] who charged him with ignoring the [[Soviet Union]]'s initiation. However, Ali Khan counter-argued that the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] had slowly extended the invitation and "were unable to fix a date to pay a state visit." Ali Khan's state visit and alignment towards the United States became a pivot in Pakistan's [[Foreign policy of Pakistan|foreign policy]] during the [[Cold War]]. After the [[Assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan|assassination]] of Ali Khan, the relations with the USSR soured until 1965 when the relations improved to such an extent that USSR sponsored the [[Tashkent Agreement]] between India and Pakistan.

In 1972, due to Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]'s [[rapprochement]], [[1972 Bhutto visit to Soviet Union|visit led to normalise]] the relation after providing a help to finance the founding of Pakistan's largest industrial complex: [[Pakistan Steel Mills]]. In a critical assessment opinion written in [[Pakistani English|English newspaper]] ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', Liaquat Ali Khan is chiefly responsible for throwing Pakistan into the US camp.

'''Advocates of [[animal rights]]''' as well as activists for [[Animal Liberation (book)|animal liberation]] hold the view that to deny the most basic needs of [[sentient]] creatures—such as the avoidance of pain—to non-human animals, on the basis of species membership alone, is a form of discrimination akin to racism or sexism. Many animal rights advocates argue that non-human animals should be regarded as persons and members of the moral community whose interests deserve legal protection.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Angus. ''Animals and Ethics: An Overview of the Philosophical Debate''. Broadview Press, 2003, p. 15ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The animal rights movement emerged in the 19th century, focused largely on opposition to [[vivisection]], and in the 1960s the modern movement sprang up in England around the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]]. In the 1970s, the Australian and American philosophers, [[Peter Singer]] and [[Tom Regan]], began to provide the movement with its philosophical foundations. Singer argued for animal liberation on the basis of [[utilitarianism]], first in 1973 in ''The New York Review of Books'' and later in his ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'' (1975), while Regan developed a [[Deontology|deontological]] theory of animal rights in several papers from 1975 onwards, followed by ''The Case for Animal Rights'' (1983).&lt;ref&gt;Finsen, Susan and Finsen, Lawrence.

A distinction persists within the movement—based on the utilitarian/deontological divide—between those who seek incremental reform, a position known as [[animal protectionism]], and those on the [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionist]] side, who argue that reform that aims to regulate, rather than abolish, the property status of animals is counter-productive.&lt;ref&gt;Francione, Gary L. and Garner, Robert. ''The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition or Regulation?''. Columbia University Press, 2010, p. 1ff, 103ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically speaking it could well be argued that the genesis of the Animal Rights movement was truly in India given the impact that both Buddhism and Jainism had on people in India and the neighbouring countries in Asia.
The largest number and highest percentage of Vegetarians per population for any country is in India. Buddhism among the global religions is an animal rights religion par excellence. It has long subscribed to the belief that all life forms including that of non-human animals are sacred and deserving of respect, and extolls kindness and compassion as utmost virtues worthy of cultivation. Buddhism unreservedly embraces all living beings in its ethical [[cosmology]] without discrimination on grounds of species, race, or creed. Buddhist tenets—including the first precept, “Do not kill”—extend to both human and non-human sentient beings. The Buddha was so adamant and protective of the more vulnerable members of the moral community—namely the animals—that he declared that: “He who has laid aside the cudgel that injures any creature whether moving or still, who neither slays nor causes to be slain—him I call an Arya (Noble person)” (Dhammapada).

'''Mark Williams''' is an American Constitutional activist, radio talk show host and author based in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[California]]. He is the author of ''It's Not Right Versus Left, It's Right Versus Wrong; Exposing the Socialist Agenda'' and ''Taking Back America One Tea Party at a Time''.

==Career==
Mark Williams is a native of [[Attleboro, Massachusetts]] and began his career by starting a radio station in the local high school in 1973.

Williams' first commercial radio job was as a salesman at the former [[WPEP]] in Taunton, Massachusetts.  He then had an over night talk show on [[WSAR]] (Fall River, Massachusetts).  He later was an executive producer position at Boston's [[WRKO]] AM. He arrived in Sacramento ([[KFBK (AM)|KFBK]] AM) in 2000 after on-air stints in San Diego ([[XETRA-AM|XTRA]] AM); Tampa ([[WFLA (AM)|WFLA]] AM); Dayton, Ohio ([[WHIO (AM)|WHIO]] AM); and the Capital District of New York ([[WGY (AM)|WGY]]).

In 2005 he and his wife/producer, Holly Williams, and Melanie Morgan of [[KSFO]] traveled to Iraq and broadcast from various locations around Baghdad, shows for which each were awarded the Mark Twain Award by the [[Associated Press Radio and Television Association]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesunchronicle.com/articles/2006/02/20/city/city4.txt AHS grad's views earn him top ratings in Calif. - The Sun Chronicle Online - City&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and two Greater Bay Area Journalism Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfppc.blogspot.com/2006/06/2006-greater-bay-area-journalism-awards.html San Francisco Peninsula Press Club: 2006 Greater Bay Area Journalism Awards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams served as the spokesperson for the [[Tea Party Express]], resigning in July, 2010, amid controversy over an entry he posted to his blog.&lt;ref name="Memoli2010"&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Memoli | first1 = Michael | last2 = Hennessey | first2 = Kathleen | date = July 24, 2010 | title = Tea Party Express spokesman resigns after racist blog post | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/24/nation/la-na-tea-party-20100724 | accessdate = September 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The post included a "mock letter to Abraham Lincoln from NAACP President Benjamin Jealous" in which he used racially charged language to respond to the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]'s stance against racist elements within the [[Tea Party movement]]. The [[National Tea Party Federation]] called it an embarrassment, and ousted the Tea Party Express from its organisation after they refused to fire Williams.&lt;ref name="Memoli2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYDailyNews"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Williams has been an opponent of the [[Park51]] project to build an Islamic community center in [[Lower Manhattan]]. Due to its proximity to the [[World Trade Center site]], he dubbed it the "Ground Zero" mosque and called it a ''"temple to terrorists,"'' saying, ''"The monument would consist of a Mosque for the worship of the terrorists' monkey-god."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/19/2010-05-19_tea_party_leader_mark_williams_says_muslims_worship_a_monkey_god_blasts_ground_z.html|title=Tea Party leader Mark Williams says Muslims worship a 'monkey god', blasts Ground Zero mosque|last=Hutchinson|first=Bill|date=May 19, 2010|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|accessdate=19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Williams' comments drew rebukes from New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]], New York State Senators and [[Muslim]] leaders.  Williams later wrote, "I owe an apology to millions of Hindus who worship Lord [[Hanuman]], an actual Monkey God. Hanuman is worshiped as a symbol of perseverance, strength, and devotion ... Those are hardly the traits of whatever the Hell (literally) it is that terrorists worship." When questioned by ''The Washington Post'' about his comments about [[Islam]] and Obama, Williams has claimed the controversy has "been fantastic for the movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2010/05/20/2010-05-20_tea_party_leader_mark_williams_says_sorry_for_monkey_god_remark__to_hindus.html|title=Tea Party Express leader Mark Williams says 'sorry' – to Hindus – for slamming Muslim's 'monkey god' |publisher=NY Daily News |date=May 20, 2010|accessdate=June 13, 2010 |location=New York |first=Samuel |last=Goldsmith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/05/mark_williams_the_monkey_god_a.html Mark Williams, the monkey god and the 'controversy' game]; ''Washington Post''; May 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mehmed-''beg'' Kulenović''', '''''Gazi'' Mehmed-''beg'' Kulenović''', '''Mehmed-''beg'' Kulinović''', also known as '''Kulin-''kapetan''''' (1776–13 August 1806) was a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]] [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] soldier born and raised in [[Bihać]] and later became the Kapetan of [[Bosnia Eyalet]]. He was a very important regional official for the Ottoman forces due to his ties with the aristocracy in [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ime (neophodno) |url=http://ljutoc.wordpress.com/2010/04/15/kulin-kapetan/ |title=Mehmed-beg Kulenović (Kulinović)-Kulin-kapetan « Ljutočka Dolina |publisher=Ljutoc.wordpress.com |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed in the [[First Serbian Uprising]].

==Early life==
Mehmed-''beg'' Kulenović was the son of ''Hadži''-Ibrahim-''beg'' Kulenović of [[Kulen Vakuf]]. He soon entered Ottoman service and became one of the most important military frontier authorities in [[Bosnia Eyalet]], he was referred to by his servicemen as the "Master of [[Ostrovica Castle|Ostrovica]]". He participated in several military campaigns starting with the assistance of ''Abu Bekir Pasha of [[Belgrade]]'', he also attempted to subdue with the aim of calming the Serbian revolt against Belgrade ''Dahia'' (renegade [[Janissary]]). But later defended the populace of [[Višegrad|Visegrad]] from Serbian insurgents. He guarded the borders of the Bosnia Eyalet on the [[Drina]] and in the summer 1806, he accompanied an Ottoman battalion that was defeated during the [[Battle of Mišar]].

==First Serbian Uprising and Battle of Mišar==
When the [[First Serbian Uprising]] broke out in 1804–05, after the assassination of [[Hadji Mustafa Pasha]] of Belgrade, turmoil had become evident throughout the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]]; thousands of Muslim refugees from the Sanjak began to pour into the [[Sanjak of Zvornik]]. In 1805 the Serbian rebels led by [[Luka Lazarević]] had begun their assault on Zvornik itself prompting the Ottoman [[Grand Vizier]] to mobilize his army in the Bosnia Eyalet commanded by [[Sulejman-paša Skopljak]] and Mehmed-beg Kulenović.

Kulenović guarded the borders of the Bosnia Eyalet on the [[Drina]] and in the summer of 1806 accompanied an Ottoman battalion led by Sulejman-paša that was on its way to Mišar. For months the Serbian rebels remained entrenched in different strongholds throughout and nearby the Mišar Hill and a pitched battle itself seemed impossible for the Serbian rebels. Mehmed-beg Kulenović and the remaining Ottoman Bosnian troops continued asymmetric efforts against the advancements of the Serbians. Kulenović's efforts were bold enough to cause Luka Lazarević to request for a cavalry challenge. But Kulenović remained with his army and was killed by Serbian rebel musket-fire, while fighting in the woods. Mehmed-beg Kulenović was wounded and then died from wounds, and his body was transferred to Bosnia and buried in the graveyard of the mosque in [[Janja]]. The rebellion continued for years after his death.

'''Nadiya Viktorivna Savchenko''' ({{lang-uk|Надія Вікторівна Савченко}}; born 11 May 1981) is a Ukrainian politician and former [[Army aviation]] pilot in the [[Ukrainian Ground Forces]]. [[People's Deputy of Ukraine]] [[8th Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada|8th convocation]] from
27 November 2014.{{r|PACE}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itd.rada.gov.ua/mps/info/page/18166|title=Офіційний портал Верховної Ради України|website=itd.rada.gov.ua|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2014 [[War in Donbass]] Savchenko, a [[lieutenant|first lieutenant]] in the Ukrainian Ground Forces, served as instructor with a volunteer infantry unit, the [[Aidar Battalion]]. In June 2014, she was captured by pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine{{r|rainOR}} and handed over to Russia where she was accused of having directed artillery fire that [[Killing of Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin|killed two Russian state-television journalists]] at the positions of pro-Russian forces in Ukraine.{{r|NewYorker-20160410}}

She was subsequently charged and convicted of murder and illegally crossing Russian state border{{r|TASS-20141107}}{{r|BBC140709}}{{r|NBC140709}} despite being [[Kidnapping|abducted]] from Ukrainian territory one hour before the deaths of the journalists.&lt;ref&gt;According to version by the prosecution, the rebels who captured Savchenko let her go and she crossed Russian border, "[http://www.novayagazeta.ru/politics/72340.html I have right for everything]", by [[Novaya gazeta]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://meduza.io/feature/2016/03/21/ya-ee-vzyal-i-lichno-peredal-plotnitskomu|title="Я ее взял и лично передал Плотницкому"|last=Azar|first=Iliya|date=21 March 2016|publisher=Meduza.io|language=Russian|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her lawyers, [[Mark Feygin]], said she was a [[prisoner-of-war]] and called on the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and the [[United Nations]] to demand her immediate release and that of the other Ukrainian [[POW]]s lest Russia be held in violation of the [[Geneva Conventions]].{{r|WP141224}}{{r|NewYorker-20160410}} European Union ministers and their representative regarded her detention as illegal and that her trial did not respect basic [[human rights]], including the right to [[Fair procedure|fair proceedings]].{{r|EEAS-2016}}

In November 2014, while still imprisoned, Savchenko was elected to the Verkhovna Rada in the [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]], and she formally resigned from her military post.{{r|NSinRda714}}{{r|TASS-20141107}}{{r|NSsp221214}} On 25 May 2016, Savchencko was exchanged in a prisoner swap for Russian [[GRU]] officers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/russian/russia/2016/05/160525_erofeev_aleksandrov_profile|script-title=ru:Ерофеев и Александров: на кого обменяли Савченко|trans-title=Erofeev and Alexandrov: who was exchanged for Savchenko|language=ru|publisher=Bbc.com|date=25 May 2016|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yevgeny Yerofeyev and Alexander Alexandrov captured by Ukraine.&lt;ref name=BBC201605 /&gt;

After returning to Ukraine, Savchenko declared her intention to participate as a presidential candidate in [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2019]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://nation-news.ru/286679-savchenko-zayavila-chto-budet-uchastvovat-v-prezidentskih-vyborah-na-ukraine-v-2019-godu Savchenko said that she will participate in the presidential elections in Ukraine in 2019 (Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, she was arrested and charged with planning a terrorist attack to overthrow the Ukrainian government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.svoboda.org/a/29413524.html They planned to finish everyone off. The case of Nadezhda Savchenko almost reached the court (Russian)], by [[RFE/RL]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Savchenko was one of Ukraine's first women to train as a military aeroplane pilot, and is the only female aviator to pilot the [[Sukhoi Su-24]] bomber and the [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopter.{{r|Grani-NS}}

== Life and military career ==
[[File:Nadiya Savchenko.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Savchenko is a Ukrainian military pilot and a former first lieutenant of the Ukrainian Air Force. She resigned after being elected as a member of the Ukrainian parliament.]]
Nadiya Savchenko and her younger sister Vira were born in [[Kiev]] in the [[Troieshchyna]] neighbourhood.&lt;ref name=RFEpJ16/&gt; Their father was an agricultural engineer, their mother a designer and cargo manager.{{r|RFE140711}} Savchenko's father was a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] while her mother was an [[anti-communist]].&lt;ref name=RFEpJ16/&gt; Her mother and sister Vira said in an interview that she and her sister were brought up in a Ukrainian-speaking household and attending Ukrainian-language schools.{{r|RFE140711}}&lt;ref name=RFEpJ16/&gt;

At 16, Savchenko was already determined to become a pilot. She joined the Ukrainian Army, working as a radio operator with the country's railway forces before training as a paratrooper.{{r|RFE140711}} She was then the only Ukrainian female [[soldier]] in the (2004–2008) [[Multi-National Force – Iraq#2008 withdrawals|Ukrainian peacekeeping troops]] in [[Iraq]]. Upon returning, she successfully petitioned the [[Ministry of Defence (Ukraine)|Defence Ministry]] for the right to attend the prestigious Air Force University in [[Kharkiv]], which until then had been open only to men; she graduated in 2009.{{r|LP140628}}&lt;ref name=RFEpJ16/&gt;

In 2010, she was posted to the [[3rd Army Aviation Regiment (Ukraine)|3rd Army Aviation Regiment]] in [[Brody]], [[Lviv Oblast]]. In 2011, the Ukraine Defence Forces published a 20-minute documentary about Savchenko and her military career.{{r|Youtube-6GWePLY1T-M}} She also featured in a [[United Nations]] Development Program as part of a drive to promote equality in the Ukrainian military.{{r|IBT140712}} Savchenko found her time in Brody boring and often got drunk.&lt;ref name=RFEpJ16/&gt; She was unhappy at being trained to fly the [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-24]] attack helicopter, instead of fast jets.&lt;ref name=RFEpJ16/&gt; Her former commanding officer at Brody, Edward Zahurskiy, described her as a problem officer, who was unstable, insubordinate, and lacked discipline.&lt;ref name=RFEpJ16/&gt;

In December 2013, Savchenko's 3rd Army Aviation Regiment was ordered to [[Kiev]] by President [[Viktor Yanukovych]].&lt;ref name=RFEpJ16&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rferl.org/fullinfographics/infographics/the-many-faces-of-nadia-savchenko/27869488.html |title=The Many Faces Of Nadia Savchenko |publisher= [[Radio Free Europe]] |date= July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Savchenko then (without permission from her commanding officer) joined the [[Euromaidan]] demonstrations.&lt;ref name=RFEpJ16/&gt; Savchenko kept a low profile during the protests; there is video of trying to persuade demonstrators not to throw petrol bombs at riot police.&lt;ref name=RFEpJ16/&gt; After [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|the president had fled Ukraine in late February 2014]], Savchenko and her unit returned to Brody.&lt;ref name=RFEpJ16/&gt;

Angry over her unit not being deployed in the [[War in Donbass]] Savchenko defied orders and left Brody and she volunteered as an instructor in the [[Aidar Battalion]].{{r|TSN-Save}}&lt;ref name=RFEpJ16/&gt;

==Capture by Donbass People's Militia==
During the [[War in Donbass]], Savchenko fought as a volunteer in the east of Ukraine in the [[Aidar Battalion]].{{r|BBC140709}}{{r|NBC140709}} On 17 June 2014, at 10:46 am&lt;ref name=":20160205"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://112.international/politics/new-evidence-in-savchenkos-case-proves-her-innocence-lawyers-2447.html |title=New evidence in Savchenko's case proves her innocence, – lawyers |publisher=[[112 Ukraine]] |date=4 February 2016 |accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was captured near the village of [[Metalist (Slovianoserbsk Raion)|Metalist]], [[Slovianoserbsk Raion]], by members of the [[Zarya Battalion]], an armed pro-Russian militant group that declared allegiance to the self-declared [[People's Republic of Luhansk]].{{r|KP140701}} On 19 June, a video of her interrogation at an undisclosed location appeared on the internet; she was shown handcuffed to a metal pipe.{{r|BBC140709}}{{r|NBC140709}}{{r|VOU140620}} On 20 June, the chief of counter-intelligence Vladimir Gromov said that Savchenko was being well treated. On 22 June, there were media reports that Savchenko had been transferred to [[Donetsk]].{{r|TSN140622}}

==Detention and trial in the Russian Federation==
[[File:Nadiya Savchenko, Moscow court, 10 February 2015 04.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Savchenko at the [[Moscow City Court|Moscow Basmanny court]] trial (February 10, 2015).]]
{{see also|Killing of Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin}}
On 8 July 2014, there were media reports that Nadiya Savchenko was being kept in a detention center in city of [[Voronezh]], the [[Russian Federation]]. On 9 July, {{Interlanguage link multi|Vladimir Markin (journalist)|ru|3=Маркин, Владимир Иванович|lt=Vladimir Markin}}, spokesman for [[Investigative Committee of Russia|Russia's Investigative Committee]] (a federal agency subordinate to the Russian President), confirmed that Savchenko was indeed held in Voronezh where she was facing charges of complicity in the 17 June killing of two Russian journalists, [[Killing of Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin|Igor Vladimirovich Kornelyuk]] (a correspondent for [[All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company]]), and sound producer [[Killing of Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin|Anton Voloshin]], who died during a mortar attack on a rebel checkpoint outside Luhansk.{{r|RFE140709}} Ukrainian officials said the reporters did not comply with safety requirements and were not accredited.{{r|BLG140710}} According to Savchenko's defence team, she was alibied by the billing data for Savchenko's and Kornelyuk's mobile phones, provided by [[Security Service of Ukraine|Ukrainian Security Service]], as she had already been captured by the Russian-backed separatists one hour before the mortar attack that killed Russian journalists.{{r|alibi}}

Since late 2015, Russia's Investigative Committee insisted she crossed the border voluntarily without documents, and in the guise of a refugee.{{r|AP140709}} This contradicted previously published evidence and media reports: long before the alleged crossing, Russia's pro-Kremlin TV channel NTV reported that Savchenko had been captured by "rebels" and then handed over to the Russian authorities.{{r|WSJ140710}} Ukrainian officials said she had been illegally taken to Russia by Russian intelligence services in collaboration with pro-Russian rebels.{{r|MFA140709}}{{r|Liga140709}} In 2016, journalist Semen Zakruzhnyi followed the Investigative Committee's alleged route pointing out to numerous inconsistencies and concluding that neither Savchenko nor Russian investigators ever visited the places mentioned in the indictment.{{r|openrussia}}

Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a strong protest against the illegal transfer of Savchenko to Russia, calling the kidnapping of the Ukrainian citizen an act of state terrorism.{{r|IR140708}} On 8 July, President [[Petro Poroshenko]] instructed the [[General Prosecutor of Ukraine]] to take all measures to bring about Savchenko's release.{{r|PUA140708}} In response, Vladimir Markin at Russia's Investigative Committee claimed that Savchenko was a terrorist and that the chances of her being released were on a par with those of Petro Poroshenko replacing [[Barack Obama]] as President of the United States.&lt;ref name=TSN140711&gt;{{cite news|url=https://ru.tsn.ua/politika/v-rossii-po-hamski-obyasnili-kogda-osvobodyat-letchicu-nadezhdu-savchenko-376395.html|script-title=ru:В России по-хамски объяснили, когда освободят летчицу Надежду Савченко|trans-title=In Russia, they explained the release of the pilot Nadezhda Savchenko in a crude manner|language=ru|publisher=Tsn.ua|date=11 July 2014|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her long trial in Russia, Savchenko has been held in a cage—which is standard practice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Herszenhorn  |first1=David M.|title=Presumed Innocent, but Caged in Court|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/world/europe/courtroom-cages-remain-common-despite-criticism.html|accessdate=20 April 2016|work=The New York Times|date=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Russia for defendants held without bail, despite the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruling that defendants should never be held in a cage in the courtroom.{{r|NewYorker-20160410}} On 10 July, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said in a website statement that her detention and trial is "A violation of all international agreements, all norms of law and is unacceptable."{{r|BLG140710}} President Poroshenko emphasized that "Nadiya Savchenko is a symbol of the struggle for Ukraine. While in captivity she has demonstrated the true, strong, martial Ukrainian spirit of a serviceman who doesn't betray the Motherland."{{r|PUA140710}} The President also said he had ordered a new lawyer for Savchenko.{{r|BLG140710}}
[[File:2015-03-01 Шествие памяти Немцова L1510360 Free Savchenko.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Opposition to Vladimir Putin in Russia|Russian opposition]] rally in [[Moscow]], March 2015]]
As of 11 July 2015, Savchenko's Russian defence lawyer is [[Mark Feygin]], who is known for his defence of [[Pussy Riot]].{{r|UP140711}} On 27 August 2014 during a hearing at the Sovetsky district court of Voronezh, Savchenko appeared wearing a T-shirt with the Ukrainian state symbol ([[Tryzub]]) and spoke exclusively in the [[Ukrainian language]].{{r|UP140827-voronezh}} She also stated that she had been detained in Russia since 24 June, not 30 June as the Russian investigation reported.{{r|UP140827-voronezh}} At the conclusion of the hearing, the court extended Savchenko's detention for a further two months and ordered that she be sent for a month to the [[Serbsky Institute]] for a forensic psychological evaluation, which Savchenko opposed.{{r|UP140827-psych}}

On 22 December 2014, [[Moscow City Court]] upheld the decision to extend the arrest of Savchenko until the end of the investigation, which was scheduled to be concluded by 13 February 2015.{{r|NSsp221214}} Savchenko subsequently began a [[hunger strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oliphant|first1=Roland|title=Nadia Savchenko: The most controversial prisoner of the war in Ukraine |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/11337627/Nadia-Savchenko-The-most-controversial-prisoner-of-the-war-in-Ukraine.html|accessdate=11 January 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] and the [[United States]] have condemned Savchenko's detention and have called for her release.{{r|IU141018}} Her lawyer, Mark Feygin, said she was a [[prisoner-of-war]].{{r|WP141224}}

Savchenko officially became a Ukrainian delegate to the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], or PACE, on 26 January 2015; thus on a legal level, she obtained [[parliamentary immunity]] in all PACE signatory states, including Russia, from that date. Despite this she was not released. [[Aleksey Pushkov]] of the Russian Duma stated that her appointment to PACE was an attack against Russia, and that gaining diplomatic immunity does not absolve one from previous crimes. However, the Russian delegation to PACE struck a different tone, stating that it "fully supports the release of Nadia Savchenko."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unian.net/politics/1036372-rossiya-ne-sobiraetsya-osvobojdat-savchenko-i-reglament-pase-ey-ne-ukaz.html|publisher=Unian|title=Россия не собирается освобождать Савченко и регламент ПАСЕ ей не указ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.liga.net/news/politics/4884219-rossiyskaya_delegatsiya_v_pase_v_korne_pomenyala_pozitsiyu_po_savchenko.htm|publisher=Liga|title=Российская делегация в ПАСЕ в корне поменяла позицию по Савченко}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.mobi/a/ukraine-russia-savchenko-pilot-pace-immunity-hunger-strike/26814383.html PACE Grants Savchenko Immunity, Demands Her Release From Russian Jail], [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (26 January 2015)&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/246245.html|publisher=[[Interfax Ukraine]]|title=Nadia Savchenko to obtain diplomatic immunity on January 26, Russia will have to let her go}}&lt;/ref&gt; PACE has declined to strip Savchenko of her parliamentary immunity, and instead has stated that Savchenko must be immediately released, finding her 2014 abduction and subsequent imprisonment to be "a violation of international law amounting to her de facto kidnapping".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-en.asp?fileid=21538&amp;lang=en |title=Resolution 2034 (2015) Final version: Challenge, on substantive grounds, of the still unratified credentials of the delegation of the Russian Federation |publisher=Council of Europe |date=2015 |accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 2015, President Petro Poroshenko awarded Savchenko with the title of [[Hero of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=heroia&gt;{{cite news |url=http://korrespondent.net/ukraine/3485964-poroshenko-prysvoyl-savchenko-zvanye-heroia-ukrayny |title=Порошенко присвоил Савченко звание Героя Украины |work=[[Korrespondent]] |date=2 March 2015 |accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2015, a spokesman for the [[Investigative Committee of Russia]], contrary to the information of Savchenko's capture published earlier by [[Donetsk People's Republic]],&lt;ref name="rainOR" /&gt; stated that she voluntarily crossed the Russian border with intention of committing acts of sabotage and freely moved on the territory of [[Voronezh Oblast]] until 30 June when she was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian migration service destroys Savchenko's abduction theory — Markin|url=http://tass.ru/en/russia/810454|agency=[[Russian News Agency TASS|TASS]]|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Александр Бастрыкин: Яценюк воевал против российской армии в Чечне|url=http://www.rg.ru/2015/09/08/bastrikin-site.html|website=Российская газета|accessdate=2015-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, the [[United States Department of State|US State department]]'s spokesperson [[Jen Psaki]] voiced deep concern over the continued ill-treatment and deteriorating health of Savchenko, and called on Russia to honour its commitments under the September 2014 [[Minsk agreement]]s, and the February 15 implementation plan by immediately releasing Savchenko and other Ukrainian hostages.{{r|Jen Psaki}} Other urges to release her followed.{{r|politolog.net}} On 7 March 2016, US Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] protested about Savchenko's continued detention, specifically mentioning concerns about her interrogations, solitary confinement, and forced "psychiatric evaluation".{{r|John Kerry}}
[[File:РОЗЕНБЛАТ БОРИСЛАВ СОЛОМОНОВИЧ VADIM CHUPRINA ©.JPG|thumb|250px|Parliament of Ukraine in April 2015]]
In March 2016, Savchenko wrote: "It is an absurd situation when those who abduct people and subject them to torture then act as if they have a right to judge them! How can one talk about a fair trial? In Russia, there are no trials or investigations—only a farce played out by Kremlin puppets. [...] those in the world with democratic values ought to learn their history lessons before it's too late and remember that there was a time when Europe was tolerant toward Hitler, and America wasn't decisive enough, and this led to World War II."&lt;ref name=RFE160304/&gt;

On the 10 March 2016, while on a hunger strike, Nadiya Savchenko made a last statement to the court, which included the statement: "I admit no guilt and I recognize neither the court nor the verdict.

==Political career==
[[File:Савченко Надія Вікторівна.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Savchenko in [[Verkhovna Rada|Parliament of Ukraine]], 31 May 2016]]
In the October [[2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election]], Savchenko was placed first on the party list of [[Batkivshchyna]].{{r|KP141013}}{{r|NSmBCEC}} (In a June 2016 interview with ''[[Radio Free Europe]]'' she stated that the party wasn't her first choice, but it "isn't the worst".&lt;ref name=RFEpJ16/&gt;) In this same election her sister Vira Savchenko was also a candidate for Batkivshchyna in an [[electoral constituency]] in [[Yahotyn]].{{r|KP141008}}{{r|resultsOkurs1498}} Nadiya Savchenko was elected as a deputy to the [[Verkhovna Rada]], the parliament of Ukraine, as a result of the election.{{r|IU141119}} Because of this Savchenko resigned from the Ukrainian army on 7 November 2014.{{r|TASS-20141107}} The Russian government has recognized the elections of Ukraine, meaning that the Russian Federation was holding a member of parliament from another nation under arrest.{{r|112UA141029}}{{r|RV141028}}{{r|TASS-20141107}} Vira Savchenko finished third in her constituency with 7.02% of the votes (winner {{Interlanguage link multi|Serhiy Mishchenko|uk|3=Міщенко Сергій Григорович}} won 40.41%) and was thus not elected.{{r|resultsOkurs1498}}

In late November 2014, Savchenko signed her parliamentary oath and passed it to Ukraine through her lawyer and was thus sworn in as [[People's Deputy of Ukraine]] (MP) on 27 November 2014.{{r|NSinRda714}}{{r|Rada-Bio}}

On 25 December 2014, Savchenko was included in Ukraine's quota for representatives in the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE); as noted above, legally this granted her [[parliamentary immunity]] in all PACE signatory nations, including Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/241787.html Verkhovna Rada includes pilot Savchenko in PACE delegation], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (25 December 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2015, Savchenko's first draft law was introduced to parliament, while she was imprisoned in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pda.pravda.com.ua/news/id_7087714/ Savchenko first co-author of the bill introduced by the Council], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (6 November 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May 2016, after returning from Russia in a prisoner exchange, Savchenko said she was prepared to become [[President of Ukraine]] if the Ukrainians wish so.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://europe.newsweek.com/nadiya-savchenko-ready-run-president-ukraine-464200?rm=eu Nadiya Savchenko Ready to Run for President of Ukraine]".

== The charge of preparing a terrorist attack in Ukraine ==
On 15 March 2018, the Attorney General of Ukraine [[Yuriy Lutsenko]] charged Savchenko with preparing a terrorist attack on the Ukrainian parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh6YpsCoZGw|title=У ГПУ є незаперечні докази, що Савченко планувала теракт в Раді – Луценко|first=|last=Радіо Свобода Україна|date=15 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lutsenko, she planned dropping the building of the [[Verkhovna Rada]] using [[Mortar (weapon)#Modern mortar|mortar fire]] and finish off all survived members of the Rada with automatic weapons.&lt;ref name="112.ua"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://112.ua/politika/lucenko-u-sledstviya-est-dokazatelstva-chto-savchenko-lichno-planirovala-terakt-v-zale-verhovnoy-rady-437364.html|title=Луценко: Савченко лично планировала теракт в зале Верховной Рады|website=112.ua|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2018 Lutsenko asked parliament to annul Savchenko's parliamentary immunity in order to prosecute and arrest her.&lt;ref name="112.ua"/&gt;

On 22 March 2018, parliament stripped Savchenko of her [[parliamentary immunity]] and allowed her arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rada strips MP Savchenko of parliamentary immunity, allows arrest|url=https://www.unian.info/m/politics/10052528-rada-strips-mp-savchenko-of-parliamentary-immunity-allows-arrest.html|accessdate=22 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day she was arrested on suspicion of planning an assault on parliament and supporting a [[coup]].&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43504396|title=Ukraine arrests war hero over 'coup plot'|date=22 March 2018|publisher=|accessdate=22 March 2018|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Savchenko claimed that she did not plan any terrorist attack, but talked with undercover Ukrainian government [[agent provocateur]]s who sought to discredit her.&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Opposition Ukrainian MP and war hero detained on coup plot charges|url=http://www.euronews.com/2018/03/22/opposition-ukrainian-mp-and-war-hero-detained-on-coup-plot-charges|accessdate=22 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Savchenko believes that Ukraine should become "more or less a dictatorship" with a strong leader to stand up to Russia and win,&lt;ref name="article34144815"&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/nadiya-savchenko/article34144815/ Freed from Putin’s Russia, a Ukrainian pilot puts Poroshenko and his party – ‘enemy No. 2’ – in her sights], [[The Globe and Mail]] (Feb. 28, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Augusto Pinochet]], [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Angela Merkel]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Nelson Mandela]] as examples.&lt;ref name="article34144815"/&gt; 
Savchenko has suggested Ukraine should accept the [[2014 Russian annexation of Crimea]] as an attempt to end the [[War in Donbass]].&lt;ref name="article34144815"/&gt;

On 15 March 2018 Savchenko claimed that "people now lawmakers" were involved with the [[List of people killed during Euromaidan|deadly sniper shootings]] during the [[2014 Ukrainian Revolution]] and that the government that came to power after the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution did not want to thoroughly investigate these shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-savchenko-terror-plot-accusations/29101770.html|title='War Hero' Savchenko Accused Of Terror Plot|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Savchenko's trial has caused a significant response inside Russia and internationally.{{r|DW-20160208}}{{r|EEAS-2016}}{{r|freesavchenko}}{{r|euobserver-20160314}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://osce.usmission.gov/nadiya-savchenko-ukrainians-held-russia-statement-pc-2/|title=On Nadiya Savchenko and other Ukrainians held by Russia: Statement to the PC|publisher=osce.usmission.gov|date=28 April 2016|accessdate=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After news of her arrest was reported on 19 June, Savchenko became the subject of an impassioned Ukrainian [[social media]] campaign portraying her as a [[Folk hero|national hero]].{{r|BBC140711}} This social media campaign used the [[hashtag]] #SaveOurGirl (that mid-July 2014 had generated more than 15,000 [[Tweet (Twitter)|tweets]]); apparently inspired by the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls used in the May 2014 [[Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping]] social media worldwide campaign.{{r|BBC140711}}

According to [[BBC News]] Savchenko is portrayed extremely negatively in the [[media of Russia]]: "Crude, and at times sexist, innuendo is used to demonise Ms Savchenko".{{r|BBC140711}} The Russian daily ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' said that Savchenko is known as a "killing machine in a skirt", and Tvoy Den called her "Satan's daughter".{{r|BBC140711}} Russian social media, however, tends to be more nuanced towards her with several anti-Kremlin users mocking perceived oddities in the Russian authorities' version of events, in particular their claim that she entered the country as a refugee.{{r|BBC140711}} In March 2016, Russian composer [[Vladimir Nazarov (musician)|Vladimir Nazarov]] wrote in an open letter to Putin saying that "not even in my worst nightmare could I have imagined that I would have to ask you not to kill a woman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tvrain.ru/articles/nazarov-405042/|script-title=ru:'В страшном кошмаре не мог представить, что буду просить вас не убивать женщину'|trans-title='In the most terrible nightmare I could not imagine that I would ask you not to kill a woman'|language=ru|website=tvrain.ru|date=8 March 2016|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, Russian opposition politician [[Alexei Navalny]] stated about Savchenko's trial, "However you look at it, this doesn't benefit Russia".&lt;ref name="BBCanas24316"/&gt; Navalny said that whoever planned to make Savchenko "a trophy prisoner" had miscalculated.&lt;ref name="BBCanas24316"/&gt; He described the trial as such an "obvious stitch-up" you could "see the threads".&lt;ref name="BBCanas24316"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rainsford|first=Sarah|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35886684|title=Savchenko case: Will Kremlin release Ukraine pilot?|work=[[BBC News]]|date=24 March 2016|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Savchencko was released from Russian prison in May 2016 [[Opinion polling for the Ukrainian presidential election, 2019|opinion polls for the Ukrainian presidential election]] showed 15% would vote for her; by early 2017 this number was below 5%.&lt;ref name="article34144815"/&gt; Savchenko blames an alleged government smear campaign (that is casting her as someone who may have been turned into a Russian agent) for this collapse.&lt;ref name="article34144815"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5061">'''Olumbe Bassir''' (1919&amp;ndash;2001) was a [[Sierra Leone]]an [[scientist]], author and academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AVgAFk6u_CMC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=olumbe+bassir#v=onepage&amp;q=olumbe%20bassir&amp;f=false|title=New Scientist:The Professor's Dilema|volume=56|page=17|number=514|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=October 5, 1972|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His primary contributions to research were in the areas of aflatoxins, nutrition, and peace research.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Senegal]] to Sierra Leonean [[Oku people (Sierra Leone)|Aku]] parents in 1919, Abdul Rahman Bassir was raised in [[Fourah Bay]] area, in the municipality of [[Freetown]], by his parents Abdul and Isatu Bassir. He attended the Prince of Wales Secondary School where he passed the Senior Cambridge examination with exemption from London matriculation. In 1946, after a short teaching spell at the prestigious Bo Government Secondary School, he attended to [[Yaba College]] where he obtained the Higher National Diploma. He then went to the United Kingdom, where he earned the Bachelor of Science degree in 1949 and PhD in 1951 from [[Liverpool University]].

==Career==
He spent most of his professional career at the [[University of Ibadan]], where he founded the [[Biochemistry]] and [[Microbiology]] departments. He laid the foundation of what became the first medical school in West Africa. By 1958, he was already a full professor. His academic specialty was [[nutrition]] and biochemical [[toxicology]]. He was at various times Head of those two departments, Dean of faculty and also served as acting Vice Chancellor. 

He had written at least 250 professional papers by 1972 when [[University of London]] conferred the coveted doctor of science degree (D.Sc.) on him. He had performed very successful lecture tours in the then [[Soviet Union]], the United Kingdom, and the United States of America among others.

Olumbe Bassir was the author of several books. His 1957 book [[Anthology of West African Verse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=SS47AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=olumbe+bassir#v=onepage&amp;q=olumbe%20bassir&amp;f=false|title= Mother is Gold: A Study in West African Literature|author=Andrian A Roscoe|page=14|isbn= 9780521096447|year= 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; was seminal in introducing written African poetry to Western audiences. His other popular books include [[Handbook of Practical Biochemistry]] (1963) and [[Metabolism of Afflatoxins and other Mycotoxins]] (1989).

In 1968, he formed a partnership with Tecwyn Williams through the British Inter-University Council for Higher Education Overseas. The programme's research division helped developed the Drug Metabolism and Biochemical Toxicology research program at Ibadan and contributed in fostering interest and making interesting findings in animal nutritional habits.

After retiring from the University of Ibadan, he remained active for several years, continuing to act as editor of the [[West African Journal of Biology and Applied Chemistry]]. He also served as chairman of the Welcome Nigeria Fund, which became the Bassir-Thomas Biomedical Foundation in the early 1990s. He also regularly organised the annual Open House Colloquim.

==Advocacy and Activism==
Olumbe Bassir was a lifelong advocate for peace, and was an active member of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]]. He also contributed to the Universities and the Quest for Peace. He was also sympathetic to the [[Fabian Society]] which he flirted with in his student days in England. 
He founded the Association of University Teachers in Nigeria which later became the Academic Staff Union of Universities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3420">'''Ramkrishna Biswas''' (? - 4 August 1931) was a [[Bengalis|Bengali]] revolutionary and martyr. He was an active member of [[Surya Sen]]'s revolutionary group.

==Early life==
Biswas was born in Saroatali, [[Chittagong]] in [[British India]]. His father's name was Durga Kripa Biswas. In 1928, Biswas came first in entrance examination among the district. He joined the revolutionary movement led by ''Masterda'' Surya Sen. In 1930 he was seriously wounded while preparing bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sansab Bangali Charitavidhan (Bengali)|last=Vol - I|first=Subodh C. Sengupta &amp; Anjali Basu|publisher=Sahitya Sansad|year=2002|isbn=81-85626-65-0|location=Kolkata|pages=480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolutionary activities==
Surya Sen and his followers decided to assassinate Mr. Craig, Inspector General of Police, Chittagong. Biswas and Kalipada Chakrabarty were assigned for this task, subsequently on 1 December 1930 they went to Chandpur station but mistakenly killed a rail officer Traini Mukherjee instead of Craig. Biswas and Kalipada Chakravarty were arrested on 2 December 1931.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Y6Dw3W9ubLkC&amp;pg=RA2-PT151&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Netaji Subhas Bose: Bengal Revolution and Independence|last=Reva Chatterjee|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biswas's family and friends lacked enough money required to travel to Chittagong to Alipore Jail of Kolkata. At that time [[Pritilata Waddedar]] was staying in [[Kolkata]] and was asked to go to Alipore Jail and meet Biswas. She introduced herself as his sister and met him. His martyrdom later inspired Pritilata.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7jaaDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT222&amp;lpg=PT222&amp;dq=ramkrishna+biswas+Surya+Sen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Bs2AjbpOeP&amp;sig=u7aMN-tKwx4ngsN01gqgfHjRmpY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL06H22_PZAhXIrI8KHTGCAC84ChDoAQg6MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ramkrishna%20biswas%20Surya%20Sen&amp;f=false|title=Indias Struggle Quarter of Century 1921 to 1946|last=Part I|first=Arun Chandra Guha|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/op-ed/politics/pritilata-waddedar-politics-remembrance-147139|title=Pritilata Waddedar: Politics of remembrance|last=Upashana Salam|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert "Bob" Carey''' (August 25, 1894 &amp;ndash; July 30, 1932) was a Midwestern armed robber and contract killer responsible for many crimes during the [[Prohibition]] era. He is considered a suspect in the infamous [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]] of 1929.
 
Born and raised in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Carey joined the [[Egan's Rats]] gang in his early twenties. By 1917, he had made fast friends with [[Fred "Killer" Burke]], who would turn out to be one of his closest criminal associates. After [[U.S. Army]] service during [[World War I]], Carey remained a low-level associate of the Egan Gang. At this time, Burke was away in prison and Bob Carey became associated with [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] hoodlum, Raymond "Crane Neck" Nugent. Both men were suspected of robbing of a Cincinnati bank messenger in December 1921 and trying to fence the bonds through the Egan's Rats. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Carey was an [[alcoholic]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} who got quite sloppy and violent when he drank. Nevertheless, it was Carey who was suspected of convincing Fred Burke to don a fake police uniform to rob a St. Louis distillery of $80,000 worth of whiskey on April 25, 1923. With the imprisonment of the upper-echelon of the Egan gang in 1924, Burke's crew had relocated to Detroit, where they were arrested for the March 1924 robbery of the John Kay jewelry store. While Carey was suspected of taking part, only Isidore Londe {{Who|date=October 2012}} was convicted, receiving a 10-20 year sentence. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Carey was suspected of participating in most of the major actions of Fred Burke's crew in the 1920s. Bob was specifically charged by [[Detroit Police Department|Detroit Police]] with murdering two freelance hoods, James Ellis and Leroy Snyder, on March 16, 1927 after he caught them cheating at poker. Along with [[Gus Winkler]], [[Fred Goetz]], Ray Nugent, and Charlie Fitzgerald, Carey took part in the American Express armored car robbery on April 16, 1928 in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. The gangsters made off with $200,000 and killed Toledo police officer George Zientara. While never publicly named as a suspect, the [[Chicago Police Department]] sought Carey for participating in the [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]] of 1929. [[FBI]] informant Byron Bolton would later claim that Carey did indeed take part, along with Fred Burke, Gus Winkler, Fred Goetz, and others. With most of his closest associates locked up or dead by early 1932, Carey left Chicago for the East Coast. He and his girlfriend ended up in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], where they began blackmailing well-to-do businessmen and politicians. The marks would bed Rose Sanborn and Carey would discreetly take pictures. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

By summer, they had moved into a [[New York City|Manhattan]] apartment at 220 W. 104th Street. Carey, now using the alias of Sanborn, had begun a high-quality counterfeiting operation out of his place. Despite his newfound success, Carey was still isolated, wanted across the country, and drinking heavily. The [[NYPD]] concluded that around midnight on July 30, 1932, Carey went berserk and shot his girlfriend Rose to death, after which he turned the gun on himself. In addition to being wanted for the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, Carey was a suspect in the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]]. Before leaving Chicago in January 1932, he had hinted darkly to associates that he was planning a crime that "would set the world on its ears". The FBI also investigated Carey in connection with the crime until the arrest of [[Bruno Hauptmann]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[[File:1st Earl of Ancram.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Robert Kerr, 1st Earl of Ancram by [[Jan Lievens]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/online_az/4:322/result/0/8758?initial=L&amp;artistId=2993&amp;artistName=Jan%20Lievens&amp;submit=1 Jan Lievens portrait of Robert Kerr] in the [[National Galleries of Scotland]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Robert Kerr (or Carr), 1st Earl of Ancram''' (c. 1578–1654), was a Scottish nobleman and writer.

==Biography==
He descended from a third son of Sir Andrew Kerr of Ferniehurst, and entered public life as laird of Ancrum in [[Roxburghshire]]. He was born about 1578, and succeeded to the family estate in 1590 on the death of his father, who was assassinated by his kinsman, Robert Key, younger of Cessford. He was cousin to [[Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset|Robert Carr]], the [[favourite]] of [[James I of England|James VI]]. Kerr appears to have also been honoured at an early age with court favour. Soon after the king’s accession to the English throne, Kerr occupied a considerable station in the household of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]]. The household of that time  was more splendid and consisted of more people than the present royal household. He subsequently was employed by [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], who became his patron through life. Charles mediated a match between Sir Robert and the [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Ancram|Lady Anne Stanley]], daughter of the [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]].&lt;ref name=Chambers-1840-315&gt;Chambers (1840), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0iopAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA315#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 315]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1620, Kerr was involved in a fatal quarrel with a young man named Charles Maxwell, who insulted him without provocation as he entered the palace at [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]]. In a duel that followed, Sir Robert killed Maxwell. Even though Maxwell's friends acquitted Kerr of blame, the king's strict rules for prevention and punishment of duels forced him to flee to Holland, where he remained about a year. During his exile, he collected pictures, for which, like his royal master, he had good taste. He eventually presented those he brought back with him to the prince. He was also distinguished by his literary taste.&lt;ref name=Chambers-1840-315/&gt;

On the accession of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] to the throne, in 1625, Sir Robert Kerr was made a [[gentleman of the bedchamber]], and on 24 June 1633, when the king was in Scotland at his coronation, he was elevated to the peerage, under the titles of [[Earl of Ancram]] and [[Lord Kerr of Nisbet, Langnewton, and Dolphinstoun]]. Previously, his son William, by his first wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Murray of Blackbarony, had married his relative, Anne, [[Marquess of Lothian|Countess of Lothian]] in her own right, and had been, by the king, endowed with full participation in that title. It was therefore arranged, in the patent granted to Kerr, that his own title should descend to the children of his second marriage. Thus, he was father of two peers.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers (1840), pp. 315, 316&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike others who owed everything to this prince, the Earl of Ancram remained the prince's steady adherent during the whole of his troubles—though he was unable to prevent his eldest son, the [[William Kerr, 3rd Earl of Lothian|Earl of Lothian]], from acting a conspicuous part on the opposite side. On the death of Charles, Kerr took refuge in Holland, where he spent the remainder of his days in solitary afflictions and poverty, and died in 1654, in the seventy-sixth year of his age. [[Jan Lievens]] painted him marvelously. His son [[Charles Carr, 2nd Earl of Ancram|Charles]], inherited his title, but ultimately merged with that of Lothian.&lt;ref name=Chambers-1840-316&gt;Chambers (1840), p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
He had two sons by his first marriage to Elizabeth Murray:
: Stanley Kerr (d. bef. May 1672){{citation needed|date=March 2010}}
: [[William Kerr, 1st Earl of Lothian]](bef. 1615&amp;nbsp;– c. October 1675)

He had one son and two daughters by his second marriage to [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Ancram|Anne]], daughter of [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]]:{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}
: [[Charles Kerr, 2nd Earl of Ancram]] (August 6, 1624&amp;nbsp;– September 1690)
: Vere Kerr
: Elizabeth Kerr

Southerland faced seven-term Democratic incumbent [[Allen Boyd]] in the November general election. Independent candidates Paul C. McKain and Dianne Berryhill were also on the ballot, and Ray Netherwood had qualified as a write-in candidate.

[[Real Clear Politics]] rated this race a "Leans GOP".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Florida 2nd District - Southerland vs. Boyd|date=October 28, 2010|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2010/house/fl/florida_2nd_district_southerland_vs_boyd-1372.html|work=[[Real Clear Politics]]|accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CQ Politics]] rated the election as a toss up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=5 CQPolitics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224144340/http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=5 |date=February 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the November 2 general election, Southerland defeated Boyd with 52 percent of the vote. Southerland is the first freshman Republican to represent the 2nd since its formation in 1963 (it was the 9th District from 1963–1967 and has been the 2nd since 1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bojorquez|first1=Manuel|title=Fla. congressman hears it from constituents about Syria|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fla-congressman-hears-it-from-constituents-about-syria/|accessdate=September 8, 2014|publisher=CBS News|date=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only other Republican to ever represent this district, [[James W. Grant|Bill Grant]], was originally elected as a Democrat in 1986, but switched parties midway through his second term.

====2012====

===Tenure===
Southerland opposes military intervention in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McLaughlin|first1=Tom|title=Miller, Southerland Voice Their Opinions on Syria|url=http://www.nwfdailynews.com/local/miller-southerland-voice-their-opinions-on-syria-1.196990|accessdate=September 8, 2014|publisher=NWFDaily News|date=September 3, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908224358/http://www.nwfdailynews.com/local/miller-southerland-voice-their-opinions-on-syria-1.196990|archivedate=September 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He voted for the [[Amash–Conyers Amendment]], which would prohibit the collection of records by the National Security Agency under the Patriot Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amash amendment: the full roll call|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/25/amash-amendment-full-roll-call|accessdate=September 8, 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He voted against the [[Agricultural Act of 2014|2014 Farm Bill]], a $1 trillion bill which expanded crop insurance for farmers by $7 billion over the next decade and created new subsidies for rice and peanut growers that would kick in when prices drop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rogers|first1=Alex|title=How Food Stamps Killed the Farm Bill|url=http://swampland.time.com/2013/06/21/food-stamps-killed-the-farm-bill/|accessdate=September 8, 2014|publisher=Time|date=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southerland has stated that he wants to replace the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] "with an approach that incorporates free-market principles. The article cited states: "Southerland prefers a system that would give consumers greater access to health savings accounts and force greater competition on insurance providers while retaining the Obamacare provision that prohibits insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. He voiced support for tort reform to help prevent frivolous lawsuits against doctors."

'''Stuart Ernest Piggott''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|CBE|FBA|FSA|size=100%|sep=,}}, [[FRSE]] [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|FSA Scot]] (28 May 1910 &amp;ndash; 23 September 1996) was a British [[archaeologist]], best known for his work on prehistoric [[Wessex]].

==Early life==
Piggott was born in [[Petersfield, Hampshire]], the son of G. H. O. Piggott, and was educated there at [[Churcher's College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
On leaving school in 1927 Piggott took up a post as assistant at [[Reading Museum]], where he developed an expertise in [[Neolithic]] pottery.

In 1928 he joined the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]] and spent the next five years producing a revolutionary study of the site of [[Butser Hill]], near [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]]. He also worked with Eliot and Cecil Curwen on their excavations at [[The Trundle]] [[causewayed enclosure]] in [[Sussex]].

In the 1930s he began working for [[Alexander Keiller (archaeologist)|Alexander Keiller]], an amateur archaeologist who funded his work from the profits of his [[Dundee Marmalade]] business. The two dug numerous sites in Wessex including [[Avebury]] and [[Kennet Avenue]]. In 1933, he joined his friend [[Grahame Clark]] in writing the highly significant paper, "The age of the British flint mines" (''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'', 1933): the resultant controversy led to the foundation of the [[Prehistoric Society]]. Still without any formal archaeological qualification, Piggott enrolled at [[Mortimer Wheeler]]'s [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]], London, taking his diploma in 1936. It was also here that he met his wife, Peggy ([[Margaret Guido]]). In 1937 he published another seminal paper, "The early Bronze Age in Wessex", and with his wife went on in June 1939 to join the burial chamber excavations at [[Sutton Hoo]] at the invitation of [[Charles Phillips (archaeologist)|Charles Phillips]].

During the [[Second World War]] Piggott worked as an air photo interpreter. He was posted to [[India]], where he spent time studying the archaeology of the sub-continent, eventually leading him to write the books ''Some Ancient Cities of India'' (1946) and ''Prehistoric India'' (1950). These experiences provided him with a valuable external view of European prehistory, which was to prove useful on his return to Britain.

After the war he went to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] to study the work of [[William Stukeley]], but in 1946 was offered the [[Lord John Abercromby|Abercromby]] [[List of professorships at the University of Edinburgh|Chair in Archaeology]] at [[Edinburgh University]] (now part of the [[University of Edinburgh School of History, Classics and Archaeology|School of History, Classics and Archaeology]]), in succession to [[V. Gordon Childe|Gordon Childe]]. Piggott succeeded in making Edinburgh an archaeology department of international standing. He continued to publish widely. His book ''Neolithic Cultures of the British Isles'' (1954) was highly influential, until [[radiocarbon dating]] tests exposed flaws in its chronology. Piggott considered that radiocarbon dating was "archaeologically unacceptable", because every other shred of evidence pointed towards his dates being correct. ''Ancient Europe'' (1965) remained a popular survey of Old World prehistory for more than twenty years, demonstrating his view of the solidarity and continuity of the past in Europe. In 1956 his childless marriage ended.

In 1958 Piggott published a survey of Scottish prehistory, ''Scotland before History'', and in 1959 a popular introductory volume, ''Approach to Archaeology''. He was president of the Prehistoric Society from 1960 to 1963, president of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] from 1963 to 1967, president of the [[Council for British Archaeology]] from 1967 to 1970, and a trustee of the [[British Museum]] between 1968 and 1974). In 1963, he produced a thorough analysis of the [[Beaker culture]] in Britain, published as part of a [[Festschrift]] dedicated to [[Cyril Fox]]. Piggott's interest in the early history of the practice of archaeology led to him writing ''The Druids'' in 1968 whilst other books included ''Prehistoric Societies''  (with [[Grahame Clark]]),  ''The Earliest Wheeled Transport'' (1983), followed by its sequel, ''Wagon, Chariot and Carriage'' (1992). His final book was ''Ancient Britain and the Antiquarian Imagination'' (1989).

He died of a heart attack at his home near [[Wantage]] in [[Berkshire]] on 23 September 1996. His remains were cremated on 30 September at [[Oxford]] crematorium.

==Family==

In 1936 he married Cecily Margaret Preston. They were divorced in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavations==
Sites he excavated (often with [[Richard J. C. Atkinson|Richard Atkinson]]) included:

*[[Cairnpapple Hill]] in [[West Lothian]]
*[[Wayland's Smithy]] in [[Oxfordshire]]
*[[West Kennet Long Barrow]] and [[Stonehenge]] in [[Wiltshire]]

==Honours==
In 1957 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Robert Schlapp]], [[David Whitteridge]], [[Sidney Newman]], and [[James Ritchie (naturalist)|James Ritchie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1972, and was awarded numerous academic awards from scholarly institutions in Britain and abroad. He retired from the Abercromby Chair in 1977 and was awarded the gold medal of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1983 and the [[Grahame Clark Medal]] of the [[British Academy]] in 1992.

==Reception and legacy==

Megaw noted that "as he himself has said, although he has done his fair share of field work and excavation, his prime concern has been to produce works of synthesis and interpretation".{{sfn|Megaw|1976|p=9}} Megaw noted that Piggott viewed "archaeology as an oyster to be savoured whole and not simply to be subjected to the minutiae of macrofaunal and calorific analyses."{{sfn|Megaw|1976|p=9}} The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] stated that it was "one aspect of his greatness that he fostered the study of early modern antiquaries as an integral part of the self-awareness of his profession."{{sfn|Hutton|2005|p=382}}

In 1968 a number of Piggott's former pupils and colleagues assembled a collection of essays in dedication to him, titled ''Studies in Ancient Europe''.{{sfn|Megaw|1976|p=9}} In 1976 Megaw then published a second ''[[Festschrift]]'' which brought in consideration of Piggott's work on the archaeology of Asia and the Americas too.{{sfn|Megaw|1976|pp=9–10}}

==Publications==

Marjorie Robertson compiled a list of Piggott's books up to 1975 for his ''festschrift''.{{sfn|Robertson|1976|pp=320–331}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1400">'''Suzanne Simone Baptiste Louverture''' (around 1742 &amp;ndash; May 19, 1816 in Agen, France) was the wife of [[Toussaint Louverture]] and the "Dame-Consort" of the [[First French Republic|French]] [[French colonial empire|colony]] of [[Saint-Domingue]].

==Family life==

After being a coachman and a driver, Toussaint was freed at the age of thirty-three, and then married Suzanne Simone Baptiste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Black Jacobins: Toussaint Louverture and the San Domingo Revolution | publisher=Vintage | author=James, C.L.R | year=1989 | location=New Yor | pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
When in 1801 the constitution appointed Toussaint as governor of Saint-Domingue, she received the title of "Dame-Consort."  

==Kidnapping==
In 1802, Charles Leclerc's troops captured her along with her husband and the rest of her immediate family. Madame Louverture survived her husband, who died that same year, and her youngest child Saint-Jean, who died in 1804 in [[Agen]], France. She died in 1816, in the arms of her sons, Placide and Isaac.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4678">'''Tiffany Lee Brown''' is an American writer, editor, and interdisciplinary artist. She is from [[Portland, Oregon]].

Author of ''A Compendium of Miniatures'' (Tiger Food Press, 2007), Brown is an editor at [[PLAZM]] magazine; she was formerly an editor at  2GQ (2 Gyrlz Quarterly), Anodyne magazine, [[Signum Press]] online, [[Future Sex (magazine)|Future Sex]] magazine, and [[FringeWare Review]]. Her writing has appeared in [[Utne Magazine|Utne]], [[Tin House]], Oregon Humanities, [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]], [[Bust (magazine)|Bust]], and [[Bookforum]]. Her performances and interdisciplinary pieces have been presented by Portland Center Stage's JAW Festival, Performance Arts NorthWest, the [[Enteractive Language Festival]], [[Portland Institute for Contemporary Art]]'s Dada Ball, the [[Portland Rose Festival]], and the Dark Arts Festival. In the early 1990s Brown was on the staff of [[The_WELL|The WELL]] in Sausalito, California.

Her largest interdisciplinary work is "The Easter Island Project," encompassing [[participatory art]], [[installation art]], video, writing, musical composition, and performance, created and presented throughout 2007–2013. Art critic Richard Speer described it this way: "The subject of this intensely personal exhibition is Brown’s evolving views about motherhood. At the beginning of her journey, she was a passionate 'childless by choice' activist; then her biological clock began to tick loudly and she found herself unhappily child-free; finally, she and her husband, Josh Berger, became the parents of a bright-eyed baby boy. The complicated emotions surrounding this evolution were the reason for Brown’s trip to the island of [[Rapa Nui]] (Easter Island), where she performed fertility-related rituals beneath the towering stone heads for which that island is known. Her talk promises to be self-revelatory, compassionate and humorous."&lt;ref&gt;Speer, Richard: "Anakena: The Easter Island Project -- Willamette Week Pick of the Week" [[Willamette Week]], June 12, 2013. Willamette Week, Portland. Web archive at [http://www.wweek.com/portland/event-158228-anakena_the_easter_island_project.html wweek.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Easter Island Project's "art gatherings," installations, and performances occurred at venues in New York, Seattle, Portland, Oakland, Prescott Arizona, and in several Pacific Northwest locations. Inara Verzemnieks wrote in The Oregonian newspaper: "As an artist, she had always sought to be fearless, to tackle difficult subjects, to provoke discussion. 'With Tiffany, things are not theoretical," says Stephanie Snyder, curator and director of the Douglas F. Cooley Memorial Art Gallery at [[Reed College]]. 'With her, it's always about the lived issues.'"&lt;ref&gt;Verzemnieks, Inara: "Multidisciplinary artist Tiffany Lee Brown seeks meaning in a quest" [[The Oregonian]], January 24, 2009. The Oregonian, Portland. Web archive at [http://www.oregonlive.com/O/index.ssf/2009/01/multidisciplinary_artist_tiffa.html oregonlive.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown and has been affiliated with the dUdU art collective since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Bart: "Fare Use: Universal Image Coding Process Protects Creativity," [[Mondo 2000]], Summer 1994, No. 12, p.3. Fun City MegaMedia, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt; She chaired the Board of Directors for the non-profit organization 2 Gyrlz Performative Arts, and Director of the non-profit [[New Oregon Arts+ Letters]] since 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10340">'''Tilhas Teezee Gesheften''' (commonly known by its acronym '''TTG''')  was the name of a group of [[Jewish Brigade]] members formed immediately following [[World War II]]. Under the guise of British military activity, this group engaged in the assassination of Nazis and SS conspirators, facilitated the illegal emigration of Holocaust survivors to Israel, and smuggled weaponry for the [[Haganah]].

==Etymology==
The three words that make up the phrase are Arabic [{{lang|ar|تِلحسْ طِيزي}}, ''tilhas tizi'', "lick my ass"] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] [געשעפטן, ''gesheften'', "business"], combined to form a modern Hebrew slang expression, meaning "You-lick-my-ass business."&lt;ref&gt;Blum (2008), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; It has been more colloquially translated as "up your ass/götveren",&lt;ref&gt;Blum (2008), p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; whereas "götveren" is a vulgar Turkish slang term for "queer/fag/faggot".

==History==

===Background===
{{see also|White Paper of 1939}}

Following the collapse of [[Nazi Germany]] and before the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|establishment of the State of Israel]], the majority of Jews in Europe were living without clarification of their legal and national statuses.&lt;ref&gt;Wyman, p. 15&amp;ndash;38 inc.; Bauer, p. 13, 48&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of them were classified as [[displaced person]]s, though where they were displaced from and where they ought to be relocated to were points of contention.&lt;ref&gt;Wyman, ch. 1; Kimche, p. 77; Bauer, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; The official position of the [[Haganah]], as defined by [[David Ben-Gurion]] and the [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]], was that European Jewry had been treated so differently that its members needed to continue to be differently treated.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, p. ch. 6 inc.; Wyman, p. 145-146&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in opposition to the policies of [[Immigration policy|quota immigration]] imposed by the [[White Paper of 1939|British White Paper]], they sought to permit and facilitate unlimited Jewish immigration of [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|Holocaust survivors]] to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, p. 200; Kimche, p. 87-107&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
&lt;!--[[File:JB_HQ.jpg]]&gt;
caption needed
--&gt;
The TTG Brigade was created by [[Israel Carmi]], who was an officer of the [[Jewish Brigade]] while concurrently acting as a senior representative of the then-underground [[Haganah]].&lt;ref&gt;Blum, p. 16, 27&lt;/ref&gt; Carmi was initially engaged in [[revenge]] operations against those believed to have been responsible, at least in part, for the [[Shoah]].&lt;ref&gt;Wyman, p. 107; Cohen, p. 192 et al.; Blum, p. 157&amp;ndash;159, 171&amp;ndash;173&lt;/ref&gt; Along with certain of his fellow soldiers in the Jewish Brigade, he was responsible [[summary execution|for executing]] hundreds of Germans, Austrians, and Italians. Most of these were identified by Carmi and his men as having been active members of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] or otherwise as having assisted in the deportation or extermination of Jews within the [[Nazi]] sphere of influence.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, p. 171&amp;ndash;173, 178, 181&lt;/ref&gt;

The TTG Brigade came into existence when Carmi falsely identified himself at a checkpoint to confuse a sentry and allow him and his companions to have unhindered passage. It led to the creation of fictional paperwork, seals, passes, orders, requisition forms, and even unit uniforms and insignia.&lt;ref&gt;Blum (2008), ch. 39&amp;ndash;40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
As Carmi's goals shifted from revenge to rescue, so too did the TTG Brigade become more and more an instrument for the liberation of displaced persons and their eventual passage to Palestine.  The function of the TTG was first and foremost to provide the illusion of official status before occupying Allied forces. This allowed the members of the Brigade to engage in rescue activities without undue interruption or objection from the occupying powers. Purporting to act as if they were under orders as part of the TTG Brigade allowed its members to pass through roadblocks, military checkpoints, and international borders, often with large numbers of displaced Jews in their care.&lt;ref&gt;Blum (2008), ch. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The second function of the group, which developed over time, was to extract from the Allied forces the greatest quantity of material and personnel assistance for the rescue efforts of the Brigade's members. This included the fictional group's requisition and use of civilian and military vehicles, gasoline, rations, medical supplies, and other such materiel. The Brigade was also involved, with the assistance of false TTG paperwork, in the acquisition of large quantities of small arms and other martial equipment for use by the Haganah in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, ch. 40, also 39&amp;ndash;43 inc.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!--
===Operation===
The group employed identification papers, letters of transit, requisition forms, passports, and other military documents.
''information needed concerning the efficacy of their efforts - such as NUMBERS!''
--&gt;

===Dissolution===
The first goal of the group, illegal emigration, became less important as military control of civilian movement became less strict. The group's Zionist goals, centering on illegal immigration to Palestine ("ha-apalah"), became obsolete with the acceptance of the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] and the establishment of Israel as a [[diplomatic recognition|recognized state]]. As more and more allied forces withdrew from Europe, fewer resources were available for acquisition by the members of TTG. Likewise, as [[Israeli war of independence|war between Israel and her neighbors]] loomed, the military skills they had accumulated encouraged withdrawal of most of them to serve as officers in the newly formed [[Israeli Defense Forces]]. 

Most of the Jews who were rescued in this manner made [[Aliyah Bet|aliyah]] to Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, p. 286&amp;ndash;290; Wymanm p. 178&amp;ndash;204&lt;/ref&gt; where they settled in the cities or else became [[kibbutz]]niks. Many of these actively supported the war effort during the [[Israeli War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, p. 231&amp;ndash;237&lt;/ref&gt; The arms and materials stolen by the TTG contributed to the Israeli war effort and warmaking capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, p. 29, 31, 278&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the members of the TTG Brigade entered service in the Haganah and fought as part of the IDF during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, p. 205&amp;ndash;207&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wernher Magnus Maximilian Freiherr von Braun''' (March 23, 1912 – June 16, 1977) was a German (and, later, American) [[aerospace engineering|aerospace engineer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neufeld|first=Michael|title=Von Braun: Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War|publisher=Vintage Books|edition=First|pages=xv|quote=Although Wernher von Braun got a doctorate in physics in 1934, he never worked a day in his life thereafter as a scientist. He was an engineer and a manager of engineers, and he used that vocabulary when he was talking to his professional peers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[space architecture|space architect]]. He was the leading figure in the development of rocket technology in Germany and the father of rocket technology and space science in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/05/2013521386874374.html Werner von Braun: History's Most Controversial Figure?], Al Jazeera&lt;/ref&gt;

While in his twenties and early thirties, von Braun worked in [[Nazi Germany]]'s rocket development program. He helped design and develop the [[V-2 rocket]] at [[Peenemünde]] during [[World War II]]. Following the war, he was secretly moved to the United States, along with about 1,600 other German scientists, engineers, and technicians, as part of [[Operation Paperclip]]. He worked for the [[United States Army]] on an [[intermediate-range ballistic missile]] (IRBM) program, and he developed the rockets that launched the United States' first space satellite [[Explorer 1]]. His group was assimilated into [[NASA]], where he served as director of the newly formed [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and as the chief architect of the [[Saturn V]] [[super heavy-lift launch vehicle]] that propelled the [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo spacecraft]] to the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/ch9.htm |title=SP-4206 Stages to Saturn, Chapter 9 |publisher=history.nasa.gov |accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASAMSFC"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NASA Marshall Space Flight Center |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/bio.html |website=MSFC History Office |title=Biography of Wernher von Braun}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, von Braun received the [[National Medal of Science]]. He advocated a [[human mission to Mars]].

== Early life ==
Wernher von Braun was born on March 23, 1912, in the small town of [[Wirsitz]], in the [[Posen Province]], in what was then the [[German Empire]] and is now [[Poland]]. He was the second of three sons. He belonged to a [[nobility|noble]] [[Lutherans|Lutheran]] family, and from birth he held the title of ''[[Freiherr]]'' (equivalent to [[Baron]]). The [[German nobility]]'s legal privileges were abolished in 1919, although noble titles could still be used as part of the family name.

His father, [[Magnus von Braun (senior)|Magnus Freiherr von Braun]] (1878–1972), was a civil servant and conservative politician; he served as Minister of Agriculture in the federal government during the [[Weimar Republic]]. His mother, Emmy von Quistorp (1886–1959), traced her ancestry through both parents to medieval European [[Royal family|royalty]] and was a descendant of [[Philip III of France]], [[Valdemar I of Denmark]], [[Robert III of Scotland]], and [[Edward III of England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erratik-institut.de/7.5.6_O33.14_vonbraun/_O33.14_vonbraun.html "Von Braun, Wernher"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719000053/http://www.erratik-institut.de/7.5.6_O33.14_vonbraun/_O33.14_vonbraun.html |date=July 19, 2011 }}, Erratik Institut. Retrieved 4 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://parsek.yf.ttu.ee/~mars/publikatsioonid/vonBraun.pdf "Dr. Wernher von Braun'i mälestuseks"], Füüsikainstituut. Retrieved 4 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Wernher had an older brother, the West German diplomat [[Sigismund von Braun]], who served as Secretary of State in the Foreign Office in the 1970s, and a younger brother, also named [[Magnus von Braun]], who was a rocket scientist and later a senior executive with [[Chrysler]].&lt;ref name="mag8"/&gt;

After Wernher's [[Confirmation (Lutheran Church)|confirmation]], his mother gave him a [[telescope]], and he developed a passion for [[astronomy]]. The family moved to Berlin in 1915, where his father worked at the Ministry of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Freiherr von Braun, ''Von Ostpreußen bis Texas. Erlebnisse und zeitgeschichtliche Betrachtungen eines Ostdeutschen''. Stollhamm 1955&lt;/ref&gt; Here in 1924, the 12-year-old Wernher, inspired by speed records established by [[Max Valier]] and [[Fritz von Opel]] in rocket-propelled cars,&lt;ref name="recoll"/&gt; caused a major disruption in a crowded street by detonating a toy wagon to which he had attached fireworks. He was taken into custody by the local police until his father came to get him.

Wernher learned to play both the cello and the piano at an early age and at one time wanted to become a composer. He took lessons from the composer [[Paul Hindemith]]. The few pieces of Wernher's youthful compositions that exist are reminiscent of Hindemith's style.&lt;ref name="Ward 2005"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ward | date=2005 | title=Dr. Space: The Life of Werner von Braun | isbn=978-1-591-14926-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} He could play piano pieces of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] from memory.

Beginning in 1925, Wernher attended a [[boarding school]] at [[Ettersburg]] Castle near [[Weimar]], where he did not do well in physics and mathematics. There he acquired a copy of ''By Rocket into Planetary Space'' (''Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen'', 1923)&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|6026491}}&lt;/ref&gt; by rocket pioneer [[Hermann Oberth]]. In 1928, his parents moved him to the Hermann-Lietz-Internat (also a residential school) on the [[East Frisia]]n [[North Sea]] island of [[Spiekeroog]]. Space travel had always fascinated Wernher, and from then on he applied himself to [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] to pursue his interest in rocket engineering.

In 1930, von Braun attended the [[Technical University of Berlin|Technische Hochschule Berlin]], where he joined the ''Spaceflight Society'' (''[[Verein für Raumschiffahrt]]'' or "VfR") and assisted [[Willy Ley]] in his liquid-fueled rocket motor tests in conjunction with [[Hermann Oberth]].&lt;ref&gt;Various sources such as [https://www.questia.com/read/9806294?title=The%20Nazi%20Rocketeers%3a%20Dreams%20of%20Space%20and%20Crimes%20of%20War The Nazi Rocketeers] ({{ISBN|0811733874}} pp 5–8) list the young Wernher von Braun as joining the VfR as an apprentice to Willy Ley, one of the three founders. Later when Ley fled Germany because he was a Jew, von Braun took over the leadership of the ''Verein'' and changed its activity to military development.&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 1932, he graduated from the ''[[Technische Hochschule]] Berlin'' (now [[Technical University of Berlin]]), with a [[diplom]]a in [[mechanical engineering]].&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/wernher-von-braun-9224912 |title=Wernher von Braun biography |publisher=Biography.com |accessdate=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early exposure to rocketry convinced him that the exploration of space would require far more than applications of the current engineering technology. Wanting to learn more about [[physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[astronomy]], von Braun entered the [[University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelm University of Berlin]] for post-graduate studies and graduated with a [[doctorate]] in physics in 1934.&lt;ref name="history.msfc.nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/recollect-childhood.html |title=Early Experiences in Rocketry as Told by Werner von Braun 1963 |publisher=History.msfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied at [[ETH Zürich]] for a term from June to October 1931.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/recollect-childhood.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although he worked mainly on military rockets in his later years there, space travel remained his primary interest.

In 1930, von Braun attended a presentation given by [[Auguste Piccard]]. After the talk, the young student approached the famous pioneer of high-altitude balloon flight, and stated to him: "You know, I plan on traveling to the Moon at some time." Piccard is said to have responded with encouraging words.&lt;ref&gt;As related by Auguste's son [[Jacques Piccard]] to fellow deep-sea explorer Hans Fricke, cited in: Fricke H. ''Der Fisch, der aus der Urzeit kam'', pp. 23–24. Deutscher Taschenbuch-Verlag, 2010. {{ISBN|978-3-423-34616-0}} (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wernher von Braun was greatly influenced by Oberth, of whom he said:

{{quote|Hermann Oberth was the first, who when thinking about the possibility of spaceships grabbed a slide-rule and presented mathematically analyzed concepts and designs ... I, myself, owe to him not only the guiding-star of my life, but also my first contact with the theoretical and practical aspects of rocketry and space travel. A place of honor should be reserved in the history of science and technology for his ground-breaking contributions in the field of astronautics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leo Nutz|author2=Elmar Wild |url=http://www.oberth-museum.org/index_e.html |title=Oberth-museum.org |publisher=Oberth-museum.org |date=December 28, 1989 |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Career and education ==
According to historian [[Norman Davies]], von Braun was able to pursue a career as a rocket scientist in Germany due to a "curious oversight" in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] which did not include rocketry in its list of weapons forbidden to Germany.&lt;ref name="Davies 2006"&gt;{{cite book |first= Norman |last= Davies |authorlink= Norman Davies |title= Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory |year= 2006 |location= London |publisher= [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |isbn= 9780333692851 |oclc= 70401618 |page= 416|title-link= Europe at War 1939–1945: No Simple Victory }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involvement with the Nazi regime===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1978-Anh.023-02, Peenemünde, Emil Leeb, Fritz Todt, Wernher von Braun.jpg|thumb|Von Braun with [[Fritz Todt]], who utilized [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor]] for major works across occupied Europe]]

====Party membership====
Von Braun had an ambivalent and complex relationship with the Nazi regime of the [[Third Reich]]. He officially applied for membership in the [[Nazi Party]] on November 12, 1937, and was issued membership number 5,738,692.&lt;ref name="Neufeld 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Neufeld|first=Michael|title=Von Braun Dreamer of Space Engineer of War|date=2007|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-26292-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96}}

Michael J. Neufeld, a widely published author of aerospace history and chief of the Space History Division at the Smithsonian's [[National Air and Space Museum]], wrote that ten years after von Braun obtained his Nazi Party membership, he signed an affidavit for the U.S. Army misrepresenting the year of his membership, saying incorrectly:&lt;ref name="Neufeld 2007" /&gt;{{rp|96}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1939, I was officially demanded to join the National Socialist Party. At this time I was already Technical Director at the Army Rocket Center at Peenemünde (Baltic Sea). The technical work carried out there had, in the meantime, attracted more and more attention in higher levels. Thus, my refusal to join the party would have meant that I would have to abandon the work of my life. Therefore, I decided to join. My membership in the party did not involve any political activity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whether von Braun's error with regard to the year was deliberate or a simple mistake has never been ascertained, although Neufeld stated that he might have lied on the affidavit.&lt;ref name="Neufeld 2007" /&gt;{{rp|96}} Neufeld further wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Von Braun, like other Peenemünders, was assigned to the local group in Karlshagen; there is no evidence that he did more than send in his monthly dues. But he is seen in some photographs with the party's swastika pin in his lapel – it was politically useful to demonstrate his membership.&lt;ref name="Neufeld 2007"/&gt;{{rp|96}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Von Braun's later attitude toward the National Socialist regime of the late 1930s and early 1940s was complex. He said that he had been so influenced by the early Nazi promise of release from the [[Post–World War I recession|post–World War I economic effects]], that his patriotic feelings had increased.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In a 1952 memoir article he admitted that, at that time, he "fared relatively rather well under [[totalitarianism]]".&lt;ref name="Neufeld 2007"/&gt;{{rp|96–97}} Yet, he also wrote that "to us, Hitler was still only a pompous fool with a [[Charlie Chaplin]] moustache"&lt;ref&gt;Spangenburg &amp; Moser. 2009. ''Wernher von Braun, Revised Edition''. Infobase Publishing. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; and that he perceived him as "another [[Napoleon]]" who was "wholly without scruples, a godless man who thought himself the only god".&lt;ref&gt;See Ward (2005), Chapter 5: "Encounters with Hitler."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Membership in the Allgemeine SS ====
Von Braun joined the SS horseback riding school on 1 November 1933 as an ''SS-[[Anwärter]]''. He left the following year.{{rp|63}} In 1940, he joined the SS&lt;ref name="Ward 2009"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ward | first=Bob | date=2009 | title=Dr. Space: The Life of Wernher von Braun | publisher=US Naval Institute Press | isbn=978-1591149279}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vault.fbi.gov/Wernher%20VonBraun/Wernher%20VonBraun%20Part%202%20of%207/at_download/file|title=Wernher von Braun FBI file|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given the rank of [[Untersturmführer]] in the [[Allgemeine SS]] and issued membership number 185,068.{{rp|121}} In 1947, he gave the U.S. War Department this explanation:

{{quote|In spring 1940, one SS-Standartenfuehrer (SS-colonel) Mueller from Greifswald, a bigger town in the vicinity of Peenemünde, looked me up in my office ... and told me that Reichsfuehrer SS Himmler had sent him with the order to urge me to join the SS. I told him I was so busy with my rocket work that I had no time to spare for any political activity. He then told me, that ... the SS would cost me no time at all. I would be awarded the rank of a[n] "Untersturmfuehrer" (lieutenant) and it were {{sic}} a very definite desire of Himmler that I attend his invitation to join.

I asked Mueller to give me some time for reflection. He agreed.

Realizing that the matter was of highly political significance for the relation between the SS and the Army, I called immediately on my military superior, Dr. Dornberger. He informed me that the SS had for a long time been trying to get their "finger in the pie" of the rocket work. I asked him what to do. He replied on the spot that if I wanted to continue our mutual work, I had no alternative but to join.}}

When shown a picture of himself standing behind Himmler, von Braun claimed to have worn the SS uniform only that one time,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8jIeqqCkDHQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dr+space+von+braun&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t6acT7fXLM3asgbRy_lh&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=uniform&amp;f=false "Dr. Space" pp. 35] "It had been thought that he publicly wore his uniform with swastika armband just once, during one of two formal..."&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2002 a former SS officer at Peenemünde told the BBC that von Braun had regularly worn the SS uniform to official meetings. He began as an [[Untersturmführer]] (Second lieutenant) and was promoted three times by Himmler, the last time in June 1943 to SS-[[Sturmbannführer]] (Major). Von Braun later claimed that these were simply technical promotions received each year regularly by mail.&lt;ref name="Dr. Space"&gt;Dr. Space, p. 35. {{cite web |url=http://www.reformation.org/wernher-von-braun.html |title=Wernher von Braun in SS uniform |website=The Reformation Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, von Braun was working on his creative doctorate when the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] (NSDAP, or Nazi Party) came to power in a coalition government in Germany; rocketry was almost immediately moved onto the national agenda. An artillery captain, [[Walter Dornberger]], arranged an [[Military logistics|Ordnance]] Department research grant for von Braun, who then worked next to Dornberger's existing solid-fuel rocket test site at [[Kummersdorf]].

Von Braun was awarded a doctorate in physics&lt;ref name="astronautix"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/vonbraun.htm |title=von Braun |publisher=Astronautix.com |accessdate=August 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817172206/http://astronautix.com/astros/vonbraun.htm |archivedate=August 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[aerospace engineering]]) on July 27, 1934, from the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] for a thesis entitled ''"About Combustion Tests"''; his doctoral supervisor was [[Erich Schumann]].&lt;ref name="Neufeld 2007"/&gt;{{rp|61}} However, this thesis was only the public part of von Braun's work. His actual full thesis, ''Construction, Theoretical, and Experimental Solution to the Problem of the Liquid Propellant Rocket'' (dated April 16, 1934) was kept classified by the German army, and was not published until 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Konstruktive, theoretische und experimentelle Beiträge zu dem Problem der Flüssigkeitsrakete. ''Raketentechnik und Raumfahrtforschung'', Sonderheft 1 (1960), Stuttgart, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1934, his group had successfully launched two liquid fuel rockets that rose to heights of 2.2 and {{convert|3.5|km|0|abbr=on}}.

At the time, Germany was highly interested in American physicist [[Robert H. Goddard]]'s research. Before 1939, German scientists occasionally contacted Goddard directly with technical questions. Wernher von Braun used Goddard's plans from various journals and incorporated them into the building of the ''[[Aggregate series|Aggregat]]'' (A) series of [[rocket]]s. The A-4 rocket would become well known as the V-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{ScienceWorldBiography|title=Robert Goddard|urlname=Goddard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, von Braun reflected on the history of rocketry, and said of Goddard's work: "His rockets&amp;nbsp;... may have been rather crude by present-day standards, but they blazed the trail and incorporated many features used in our most modern rockets and space vehicles."&lt;ref name="recoll"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/recollect-childhood.html |title=Recollections of Childhood: Early Experiences in Rocketry as Told by Werner von Braun 1963 |website=MSFC History Office |publisher=NASA Marshall Space Flight Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goddard confirmed his work was used by von Braun in 1944, shortly before the Nazis began firing V-2s at England. A V-2 crashed in Sweden and some parts were sent to an Annapolis lab where Goddard was doing research for the Navy. If this was the so-called [[Sweden during World War II#The Bäckebo rocket|Bäckebo Bomb]], it had been procured by the British in exchange for [[Spitfire]]s; Annapolis would have received some parts from them. Goddard is reported to have recognized components he had invented, and inferred that his brainchild had been turned into a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.modernmechanix.com/2007/04/28/the-man-who-opened-the-door-to-space/ |title=The Man Who Opened the Door to Space |website=Popular Science |date=May 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, von Braun would comment: "I have very deep and sincere regret for the victims of the V-2 rockets, but there were victims on both sides ... A war is a war, and when my country is at war, my duty is to help win that war."&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld, Michael J. 2008. ''Wernher von Braun: Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War''. Vintage. p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Goddard's claims, von Braun said "at no time in Germany did I or any of my associates ever see a Goddard patent". This was independently confirmed.&lt;ref name=D&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pQCEqGZ5KHwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq "Dr. Space: The Life of Wernher von Braun"], Bob Ward. Naval Institute Press, Jul 10, 2013. Retrieved 6 mar 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that claims about him lifting Goddard's work were the furthest from the truth, noting that Goddard's paper "A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes", which was studied by von Braun and Oberth, lacked the specificity of liquid-fuel experimentation with rockets.&lt;ref name=D /&gt; It was also confirmed that he was responsible for an estimated 20 patentable innovations related to rocketry during the ''[[Volksverhetzung]]'' era, as well as receiving U.S. patents after the war concerning the advancement of rocketry.&lt;ref name=D /&gt; Documented accounts also stated he provided solutions to a host of aerospace engineering problems in the 1950s and 60s.&lt;ref name=D /&gt;

There were no German rocket societies after the collapse of the [[Verein für Raumschiffahrt|VfR]], and civilian rocket tests were forbidden by the new [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]. Only military development was allowed, and to this end, a larger facility was erected at the village of [[Peenemünde]] in northern Germany on the [[Baltic Sea]]. Dornberger became the military commander at Peenemünde, with von Braun as technical director. In collaboration with the [[Luftwaffe]], the Peenemünde group developed liquid-fuel rocket engines for aircraft and [[jet-assisted takeoff]]s. They also developed the long-range [[V-2 rocket|A-4]] [[ballistic missile]] and the [[supersonic]] [[Wasserfall missile|Wasserfall]] [[Surface-to-air missile|anti-aircraft missile]].

[[File:V-2 rocket diagram (with English labels).svg|thumb|Schematic of the A4/V2]]
On December 22, 1942, [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered the production of the A-4 as a "vengeance weapon", and the Peenemünde group developed it to target London. Following von Braun's July 7, 1943 presentation of a color movie showing an A-4 taking off, Hitler was so enthusiastic that he personally made von Braun a professor shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Speer, Albert (1969). ''Erinnerungen'', p. 377. Verlag Ullstein GmbH, Frankfurt a.M. and Berlin, {{ISBN|3-550-06074-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany at this time, this was an exceptional promotion for an engineer who was only 31 years old.

By that time, the British and [[Soviet intelligence]] agencies were aware of the rocket program and von Braun's team at Peenemünde, based on the intelligence provided by the Polish underground [[Home Army]]. Over the nights of August 17–18, 1943, [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s [[Operation Hydra (1943)|Operation Hydra]] dispatched raids on the Peenemünde camp consisting of 596 aircraft, and dropped 1,800 tons of explosives.&lt;ref name=RAF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/peenemunde.html|title=Peenemünde, 17 and 18 August 1943|website=RAF History – Bomber Command|accessdate=November 15, 2006|publisher=Royal Air Force|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101001350/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/peenemunde.html|archive-date=November 1, 2006|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was salvaged and most of the engineering team remained unharmed; however, the raids killed von Braun's engine designer [[Walter Thiel]] and Chief Engineer Walther, and the rocket program was delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Middlebrook|first=Martin|title=The Peenemünde Raid: The Night of 17–18 August 1943|date=1982|publisher=Bobs-Merrill|location=New York|page=222 |isbn=978-0-672-52759-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dornberger&gt;{{cite book |last=Dornberger|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Dornberger|title=V2—Der Schuss ins Weltall|date=1952|publisher=Bechtle Verlag (US translation ''V-2'' Viking Press:New York, 1954)|location=Esslingan|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first combat A-4, renamed the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] (''Vergeltungswaffe 2'' "Retaliation/Vengeance Weapon 2") for propaganda purposes, was launched toward England on September 7, 1944, only 21 months after the project had been officially commissioned. Von Braun's interest in rockets was specifically for the application of [[spacefaring|space travel]], not for killing people.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld,  Michael J. 2008. ''Wernher von Braun: Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War.'' Vintage. p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; After hearing the news from London, he said that "the rocket worked perfectly, except for landing on the wrong planet." Satirist [[Mort Sahl]] has been credited with mocking von Braun by saying "I aim at the stars, but sometimes I hit London."&lt;ref name="sahl"&gt;{{cite news |work=Time |title=The Moon and the Clones |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988837,00.html |first=Lance |last=Morrow |date=August 3, 1998 |accessdate=August 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That line appears in the film ''[[I Aim at the Stars]]'', a 1960 [[biopic]] of von Braun.

=== Experiments with rocket aircraft ===
During 1936, von Braun's rocketry team working at Kummersdorf investigated installing liquid-fuelled rockets in aircraft. [[Ernst Heinkel]] enthusiastically supported their efforts, supplying a [[Heinkel He 72|He-72]] and later two [[Heinkel He 112|He-112]]s for the experiments. Later in 1936, [[Erich Warsitz]] was seconded by the [[Reich Air Ministry|RLM]] to Wernher von Braun and Ernst Heinkel, because he had been recognized as one of the most experienced test pilots of the time, and because he also had an extraordinary fund of technical knowledge.&lt;ref name="warsitz"&gt;{{cite book | last=Warsitz | first=Lutz | title = The First Jet Pilot: The Story of German Test Pilot Erich Warsitz | date = 2009 | publisher = Pen and Sword Books Ltd. | isbn=978-1-84415-818-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} After he familiarized Warsitz with a test-stand run, showing him the corresponding apparatus in the aircraft, he asked: "Are you with us and will you test the rocket in the air? Then, Warsitz, you will be a famous man. And later we will fly to the Moon – with you at the helm!"&lt;ref name="warsitz"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

[[File:He112FARR.jpg|thumb|A regular He 112]]
In June 1937, at [[Neuhardenberg]] (a large field about {{convert|70|km|0|abbr=on}} east of Berlin, listed as a reserve airfield in the event of war), one of these latter aircraft was flown with its [[piston engine]] shut down during flight by Warsitz, at which time it was propelled by von Braun's rocket power alone. Despite a wheels-up landing and the fuselage having been on fire, it proved to official circles that an aircraft could be flown satisfactorily with a back-thrust system through the rear.&lt;ref name="warsitz"/&gt;{{rp|51}}

At the same time, [[Hellmuth Walter]]'s experiments into [[hydrogen peroxide]] based rockets were leading towards light and simple rockets that appeared well-suited for aircraft installation. Also the firm of Hellmuth Walter at Kiel had been commissioned by the RLM to build a rocket engine for the [[Heinkel He 112|He 112]], so there were two different new rocket motor designs at Neuhardenberg: whereas von Braun's engines were powered by alcohol and liquid oxygen, Walter engines had hydrogen peroxide and [[calcium permanganate]] as a [[catalyst]]. Von Braun's engines used direct combustion and created fire, the Walter devices used hot vapors from a chemical reaction, but both created thrust and provided high speed.&lt;ref name="warsitz"/&gt;{{rp|41}} The subsequent flights with the He-112 used the Walter-rocket instead of von Braun's; it was more reliable, simpler to operate, and safer for the test pilot, Warsitz.&lt;ref name="warsitz"/&gt;{{rp|55}}

=== Slave labor ===
SS General [[Hans Kammler]], who as an engineer had constructed several [[concentration camp]]s, including [[Auschwitz]], had a reputation for brutality and had originated the idea of using [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|concentration camp prisoners as slave laborers]] in the rocket program. [[Arthur Rudolph]], chief engineer of the V-2 rocket factory at Peenemünde, endorsed this idea in April 1943 when a labor shortage developed. More people died building the V-2 rockets than were killed by it as a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tracy Dungan |url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/mittel.html |title=Mittelbau Overview |publisher=V2rocket.com |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Braun admitted visiting the plant at [[Mittelwerk]] on many occasions, and called conditions at the plant "repulsive", but claimed never to have witnessed any deaths or beatings, although it had become clear to him by 1944 that deaths had occurred.&lt;ref name="power2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/excerpts.html |title=Excerpts from 'Power to Explore' |website=MSFC History Office |publisher=NASA Marshall Space Flight Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; He denied ever having visited the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] concentration camp itself, where 20,000 died from illness, beatings, hangings, and intolerable working conditions.&lt;ref name="TimeD"&gt;{{cite news |date=March 26, 2002 |url=http://www.time.com/time/columnist/jaroff/article/0,9565,220201,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=The Rocket Man's Dark Side |first=Leon |last=Jaroff |accessdate=June 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120527011940/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,220201,00.html |archivedate=May 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prisoners claim von Braun engaged in brutal treatment or approved of it. Guy Morand, a French resistance fighter who was a prisoner in Dora, testified in 1995 that after an apparent sabotage attempt, von Braun ordered a prisoner to be flogged,&lt;ref name=bid&gt;{{Cite book |last=Biddle |first=Wayne |title=Dark Side of the Moon: Wernher von Braun, the Third Reich, and the Space Race |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |date=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yjiPpJOwYXoC&amp;q=flogged+#v=snippet&amp;q=flogged&amp;f=false|isbn=9780393072648 }}{{rp|124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Robert Cazabonne, another French prisoner, claimed von Braun stood by as prisoners were hanged by chains suspended by cranes.&lt;ref name=bid/&gt;{{rp|123–124}} However, these accounts may have been a case of mistaken identity.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Neufeld (Feb., 2002) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1433245 "Wernher von Braun, the SS, and Concentration Camp Labor: Questions of Moral, Political, and Criminal Responsibility"], ''German Studies Review'', Vol. 25, No. 1, pp. 57–78&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Buchenwald]] inmate Adam Cabala claims that von Braun went to the concentration camp to pick slave laborers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] also the German scientists led by Prof. Wernher von Braun were aware of everything daily. As they went along the corridors, they saw the exhaustion of the inmates, their arduous work and their pain. Not one single time did Prof. Wernher von Braun protest against this cruelty during his frequent stays at Dora. Even the aspect of corpses did not touch him: On a small area near the ambulance shed, inmates tortured to death by slave labor and the terror of the overseers were piling up daily.  But, Prof. Wernher von Braun passed them so close that he was almost touching the corpses.&lt;ref&gt;Fiedermann, Heß, and Jaeger (1993) ''Das KZ Mittelbau Dora. Ein historischer Abriss'', p. 100, Westkreuz Verlag, Berlin {{ISBN|978-3-92213-194-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Von Braun later claimed that he was aware of the treatment of prisoners, but felt helpless to change the situation.&lt;ref name="StuhlingerOrdway1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ernst Stuhlinger|author2=Frederick Ira Ordway|title=Wernher von Braun, crusader for space: a biographical memoir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pZTAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=December 18, 2011|date=April 1994|publisher=Krieger Pub.|isbn=978-0-89464-842-7|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Highly dubious, self-serving claim. Is it endorsed by any historians? — When asked if von Braun could have protested against the brutal treatment of the slave laborers, von Braun team member [[Konrad Dannenberg]] (a member of the Nazi party since 1932) told ''The Huntsville Times'', "If he had done it, in my opinion, he would have been shot on the spot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Huntsville Times |title=Aide says von Braun wasn't able to stop slave horrors; Objection would have gotten rocket pioneer shot, Dannenberg says |date=October 4, 2002 |first=Lee |last=Roop |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021026180521/http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?%2Fxml%2Fstory.ssf%2Fhtml_standard.xsl%3F%2Fbase%2Fnews%2F1033754724262943.xml |archivedate=October 26, 2002 |url=http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/xml/story.ssf/html_standard.xsl?/base/news/1033754724262943.xml |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

=== Arrest and release by the Nazi regime ===
According to André Sellier, a French historian and survivor of the [[Mittelbau-Dora]] concentration camp, [[Heinrich Himmler]] had von Braun come to his Feldkommandostelle Hochwald HQ in [[East Prussia]] in February 1944.&lt;ref name="sellier"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sellier |first=André |date=2003 |title=A History of the Dora Camp: The Untold Story of the Nazi Slave Labor Camp That Secretly Manufactured V-2 Rockets |place=Chicago, IL |publisher=Ivan R Dee |isbn=978-1-56663-511-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; To increase his power-base within the Nazi regime, Himmler was conspiring to use Kammler to gain control of all German armament programs, including the V-2 program at Peenemünde.&lt;ref name="Ward 2005"/&gt;{{rp|38–40}} He therefore recommended that von Braun work more closely with Kammler to solve the problems of the V-2. Von Braun claimed to have replied that the problems were merely technical and he was confident that they would be solved with Dornberger's assistance.

Von Braun had been under [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] surveillance since October 1943. A report stated that he and his colleagues [[Klaus Riedel|Riedel]] and [[Helmut Gröttrup|Gröttrup]] were said to have expressed regret at an engineer's house one evening that they were not working on a spaceship and that they felt the war was not going well; this was considered a "defeatist" attitude. A young female dentist who was an SS spy reported their comments.&lt;ref name="Ward 2005"/&gt;{{rp|38–40}} Combined with Himmler's false charges that von Braun was a communist sympathizer and had attempted to sabotage the V-2 program, and considering that von Braun regularly piloted his government-provided airplane that might allow him to escape to England, this led to his arrest by the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref name="Ward 2005"/&gt;{{rp|38–40}}

The unsuspecting von Braun was detained on March 14 (or March 15),&lt;ref name="grdev"&gt;{{cite web |title=Highlights in German Rocket Development from 1927–1945 |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/highlights.html |website=MSFC History Office |publisher=NASA Marshall Space Flight Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1944, and was taken to a Gestapo cell in [[Szczecin|Stettin]] (now Szczecin, Poland),&lt;ref name="Ward 2005"/&gt;{{rp|38–40}} where he was held for two weeks without knowing the charges against him.

Through the [[Abwehr]] in Berlin, Dornberger obtained von Braun's conditional release and [[Albert Speer]], Reichsminister for Munitions and War Production, persuaded Hitler to reinstate von Braun so that the V-2 program could continue&lt;ref name="Ward 2005"/&gt;{{rp|38–40}} or turn into a "V-4 program" which in their view would be impossible without von Braun's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Bob. 2013. ''Dr. Space: The Life of Wernher von Braun''. Naval Institute Press. Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Speer states Hitler had finally conceded that von Braun was to be "protected from all prosecution as long as he is indispensable, difficult though the general consequences arising from the situation."&lt;ref name="Speer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Speer|first1=Albert|title=Inside the Third Reich|date=1995|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9781842127353|pages=501–502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dornberger-Axter-von Braun.jpg|thumb|Von Braun, with his arm in a cast from a car accident, [[surrender (military)|surrendered]] to the Americans just before this May 3, 1945 photo.]]

=== Surrender to the Americans ===
The [[Soviet Army]] was about {{convert|160|km|-1|abbr=on}} from [[Peenemünde]] in the spring of 1945 when von Braun assembled his planning staff and asked them to decide how and to whom they should surrender. Unwilling to go to the Soviets, von Braun and his staff decided to try to surrender to the Americans. Kammler had ordered relocation of his team to central Germany; however, a conflicting order from an army chief ordered them to join the army and fight. Deciding that Kammler's order was their best bet to defect to the Americans, von Braun fabricated documents and transported 500 of his affiliates to the area around Mittelwerk, where they resumed their work. For fear of their documents being destroyed by the SS, von Braun ordered the blueprints to be hidden in an abandoned mine shaft in the [[Harz]] mountain range.&lt;ref name="Cadbury"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cadbury|first=Deborah|authorlink=Deborah Cadbury|title=Space Race|date=2005|publisher=[[BBC Worldwide Limited]]|isbn=978-0-00-721299-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on an official trip in March, von Braun suffered a complicated fracture of his left arm and shoulder in a car accident after his driver fell asleep at the wheel. His injuries were serious, but he insisted that his arm be set in a cast so he could leave the hospital. Due to this neglect of the injury he had to be hospitalized again a month later where his bones had to be re-broken and re-aligned.&lt;ref name="Cadbury"/&gt;

In April, as the Allied forces advanced deeper into Germany, Kammler ordered the engineering team to be moved by train into the town of [[Oberammergau]] in the [[Bavarian Alps]] where they were closely guarded by the SS with orders to execute the team if they were about to fall into enemy hands. However, von Braun managed to convince SS Major Kummer to order the dispersal of the group into nearby villages so that they would not be an easy target for U.S. bombers.&lt;ref name="Cadbury"/&gt;

Von Braun and a large number of the engineering team subsequently made it to Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://efour4ever.com/44thdivision/vonbrauncapture.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428051040/http://efour4ever.com/44thdivision/vonbrauncapture.html |archivedate=April 28, 2015 |df=mdy-all }} Capture of Werner von Braun by the 324th Regiment Anti-tank Company&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 2, 1945, upon finding an American private from the U.S. [[44th Infantry Division (United States)|44th Infantry Division]], von Braun's brother and fellow rocket engineer, Magnus, approached the soldier on a bicycle, calling out in broken English: "My name is Magnus von Braun.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We knew that we had created a new means of warfare, and the question as to what nation, to what victorious nation we were willing to entrust this brainchild of ours was a moral decision more than anything else. We wanted to see the world spared another conflict such as Germany had just been through, and we felt that only by surrendering such a weapon to people who are guided by the Bible could such an assurance to the world be best secured.&lt;ref&gt;Arts &amp; Entertainment, Biography (1959–1961 series). Mike Wallace, television biography of Wernher von Braun, video clip of the press statement.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The American high command was well aware of how important their catch was: von Braun had been at the top of ''the Black List'', the code name for the list of German scientists and engineers targeted for immediate interrogation by U.S. military experts. On June 19, 1945, two days before the scheduled handover of the [[Nordhausen]] area to the Soviets, U.S. Army Major Robert B. Staver, Chief of the Jet Propulsion Section of the Research and Intelligence Branch of the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Ordnance Corps]] in London, and Lt Col R. L. Williams took von Braun and his department chiefs by Jeep from Garmisch to Munich and then flown to Nordhausen; on the next day the group was evacuated {{convert|40|mi}} southwest to [[Witzenhausen]], a small town in the [[American Zone]].&lt;ref name=McGovern&gt;{{cite book|last=McGovern|first=J|title=Crossbow and Overcast|date=1964|publisher=W. Morrow|location=New York|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Braun was briefly detained at the "Dustbin" interrogation center at [[Kransberg Castle]] where the elite of the Third Reich's economy, science and technology were debriefed by U.S. and British intelligence officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Speer|first=Albert|editor=Schlie, Ulrich|date=2001|title=Alles, was ich weiß|publisher=F.A.

There is evidence, however, that British intelligence and scientists were the first to interview him in depth, eager to gain information that they knew U.S. officials would deny them. The team included the young L.S. Snell, then the leading British rocket engineer, later chief designer of [[Rolls-Royce Limited]] and inventor of the [[Concorde]]'s engines. The specific information the British gleaned remained top secret, both from the Americans and other allies.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

On June 20, 1945, the [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] approved the transfer of von Braun and his specialists to America; however, this was not announced to the public until October 1, 1945.&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/paperclip.gif |title=Outstanding German Scientists Being Brought to U.S |website=War Department press release |date=October 1, 1945 |publisher=V2Rocket.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5o4n4VGwL?url=http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/paperclip.gif |archivedate=March 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Braun was among those scientists for whom the [[Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency]] (JIOA) arguably falsified employment histories and expunged [[NSDAP]] memberships. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The first seven technicians arrived in the United States at [[New Castle Army Air Field]], just south of [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], Delaware, on September 20, 1945. They were then flown to Boston and taken by boat to the [[United States Army Military Intelligence|Army Intelligence]] Service post at [[Fort Strong]] in [[Boston Harbor]]. Later, with the exception of von Braun, the men were transferred to [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] in [[Maryland]] to sort out the Peenemünde documents, enabling the scientists to continue their rocketry experiments.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Finally, von Braun and his remaining Peenemünde staff (see [[List of German rocket scientists in the United States]]) were transferred to their new home at [[Fort Bliss]], a large Army installation just north of [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]. Von Braun would later write he found it hard to develop a "genuine emotional attachment" to his new surroundings.&lt;ref name=RM&gt;Matthew Brzezinski (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=sfzMcwF5DC4C  ''Red Moon Rising: Sputnik and the Hidden Rivalries That Ignited the Space Age''], pp. 84–92, Henry Holt, New York {{ISBN|978-0-80508-147-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His chief design engineer Walther Reidel became the subject of a December 1946 article "German Scientist Says American Cooking Tasteless; Dislikes Rubberized Chicken", exposing the presence of von Braun's team in the country and drawing criticism from [[Albert Einstein]] and [[John D. Dingell, Sr.|John Dingell]].&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; Requests to improve their living conditions such as laying linoleum over their cracked wood flooring were rejected.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; Von Braun remarked, "at Peenemünde we had been coddled, here you were counting pennies".&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; At Peenemünde, von Braun had thousands of engineers who answered to him, but was now answering to "pimply" 26-year-old Major Jim Hamill who possessed an undergraduate degree in engineering.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt; His loyal Germans still addressed him as Herr Professor, but Hamill addressed him as Wernher and never responded to von Braun's request for more materials. Every proposal for new rocket ideas was dismissed.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt;

While there, they trained military, industrial, and university personnel in the intricacies of rockets and guided missiles. As part of the [[Hermes project]], they helped refurbish, assemble, and launch a number of V-2s that had been shipped from Germany to the [[White Sands Proving Ground]] in [[New Mexico]]. They also continued to study the future potential of rockets for military and research applications. Since they were not permitted to leave Fort Bliss without military escort, von Braun and his colleagues began to refer to themselves only half-jokingly as "PoPs" – "Prisoners of Peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982248820|title=Von Braun : dreamer of space, engineer of war|last=1951-|first=Neufeld, Michael J.,|publisher=|isbn=9780525435914|edition=First Vintage books|location=New York|pages=218|oclc=982248820|date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, at the start of the [[Korean War]], von Braun and his team were transferred to [[Huntsville, Alabama]], his home for the next 20 years. Between 1952 and 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-2349|title=Wernher von Braun {{!}} Encyclopedia of Alabama|website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; von Braun led the Army's rocket development team at [[Redstone Arsenal]], resulting in the [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone rocket]], which was used for the first live [[ballistic missile|nuclear ballistic missile]] tests conducted by the United States. He personally witnessed this historic launch and detonation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLbyY76zt9w&amp;t=8|title=REDSTONE ROCKET, HARDTACK-TEAK TEST, AUGUST 1958|date=October 3, 2011|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the Redstone led to development of the first high-precision inertial guidance system on the Redstone rocket.&lt;ref name=NTRS&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bucher, G.

As director of the Development Operations Division of the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]], von Braun, with his team, then developed the [[Jupiter-C]], a modified Redstone rocket.&lt;ref name="time58"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862899-1,00.html |work=TIME Magazine |title=Reach for the Stars |date=February 17, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jupiter-C successfully launched the West's first satellite, [[Explorer 1]], on January 31, 1958. This event signaled the birth of America's space program.

Despite the work on the Redstone rocket, the 12 years from 1945 to 1957 were probably some of the most frustrating for von Braun and his colleagues. In the [[Soviet Union]], [[Sergei Korolev]] and his team of scientists and engineers plowed ahead with several new rocket designs and the [[Sputnik]] program, while the American government was not very interested in von Braun's work or views and embarked only on a very modest rocket-building program. In the meantime, the press tended to dwell on von Braun's past as a member of the SS and the [[slave labor]] used to build his V-2 rockets.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Popular concepts for a human presence in space ===
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}
Repeating the pattern he had established during his earlier career in Germany, von Braun – while directing military rocket development in the real world – continued to entertain his engineer-scientist's dream of a future in which rockets would be used for [[space exploration]]. However, he was no longer at risk of being sacked – as American public opinion of Germans began to recover, von Braun found himself increasingly in a position to popularize his ideas. The May 14, 1950, headline of ''[[The Huntsville Times]]'' ("Dr. von Braun Says Rocket Flights Possible to Moon") might have marked the beginning of these efforts. Von Braun's ideas rode a publicity wave that was created by science fiction movies and stories.

[[File:President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Dr. von Braun and Others.jpg|thumb|240px|Von Braun with President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], 1960]]
In 1952, von Braun first published his concept of a manned [[space station]] in a ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' magazine series of articles titled "[[Man Will Conquer Space Soon!]]". These articles were illustrated by the space artist [[Chesley Bonestell]] and were influential in spreading his ideas. Frequently, von Braun worked with fellow German-born space advocate and science writer [[Willy Ley]] to publish his concepts, which, unsurprisingly, were heavy on the engineering side and anticipated many technical aspects of space flight that later became reality.

The space station (to be constructed using rockets with recoverable and reusable ascent stages) would be a [[Stanford torus|toroid]] structure, with a diameter of {{convert|250|ft|m}}; this built on the concept of a [[rotating wheel space station|rotating wheel-shaped station]] introduced in 1929 by [[Herman Potočnik]] in his book ''The Problem of Space Travel – The Rocket Motor''. The space station would spin around a central docking nave to provide [[artificial gravity]], and would be assembled in a {{convert|1,075|mi|km|adj=on}} two-hour, high-inclination [[Earth orbit]] allowing observation of essentially every point on Earth on at least a daily basis. The ultimate purpose of the space station would be to provide an assembly platform for manned [[Moon|lunar]] expeditions. More than a decade later, the movie version of [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']] would draw heavily on the design concept in its visualization of an orbital space station.

Von Braun envisaged these expeditions as very large-scale undertakings, with a total of 50&amp;nbsp;astronauts traveling in three huge spacecraft (two for crew, one primarily for cargo), each {{convert|49|m|2|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|33|m|2|abbr=on}} in diameter and driven by a rectangular array of 30&amp;nbsp;rocket propulsion engines.&lt;ref name="seh1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/lunarlan.html |title=Gallery of Wernher von Braun Moonship Sketches |date=Nov 30, 2004 |website=The Space Educator's Handbook |publisher=NASA Johnson Space Center |first=Jerry |last=Woodfill |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5o4nSQ9VI?url=http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/lunarlan.html |archivedate=March 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival, astronauts would establish a [[Colonization of the Moon|permanent lunar base]] in the [[Sinus Roris]] region by using the emptied cargo holds of their craft as shelters, and would explore their surroundings for eight weeks. This would include a {{convert|400|km|0|adj=on|abbr=on}} expedition in pressurized rovers to the crater [[Harpalus (crater)|Harpalus]] and the [[Mare Imbrium]] foothills.

[[File:Walt Disney and Dr. Wernher von Braun - GPN-2000-000060.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walt Disney]] and von Braun, seen in 1954 holding a model of his passenger ship, collaborated on a series of three educational films.]]
At this time, von Braun also worked out preliminary concepts for a [[manned mission to Mars]] that used the space station as a staging point. His initial plans, published in ''[[The Mars Project]]'' (1952), had envisaged a fleet of 10 spacecraft (each with a mass of 3,720 metric tonnes), three of them unmanned and each carrying one 200-tonne winged lander&lt;ref name="seh1"/&gt; in addition to cargo, and nine crew vehicles transporting a total of 70&amp;nbsp;astronauts. Gigantic as this mission plan was, its engineering and astronautical parameters were thoroughly calculated. A later project was much more modest, using only one purely orbital cargo ship and one crewed craft. In each case, the expedition would use minimum-energy [[Hohmann transfer orbit]]s for its trips to Mars and back to Earth.

Before technically formalizing his thoughts on human [[spaceflight]] to Mars, von Braun had written a science fiction novel on the subject, set in the year 1980. However, the manuscript was rejected by no fewer than 18&amp;nbsp;publishers.&lt;ref name="bergaust"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bergaust | first=Erik |date=1976 |title=Wernher von Braun: The authoritative and definitive biographical profile of the father of modern space flight (Hardcover) |publisher=National Space Institute|isbn=978-0-917680-01-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Von Braun later published small portions of this opus in magazines, to illustrate selected aspects of his Mars project popularizations. The complete manuscript, titled ''Project MARS: A Technical Tale'', did not appear as a printed book until December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Wernher von Braun (2006) ''Project Mars : a technical tale'', Apogee Books, Burlington, Ontario {{ISBN|978-0-97382-033-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the hope that its involvement would bring about greater public interest in the future of the space program, von Braun also began working with [[Walt Disney]] and the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney studios]] as a technical director, initially for three television films about space exploration. The initial broadcast devoted to space exploration was ''[[Man in Space]]'', which first went on air on March 9, 1955, drawing 40 million viewers.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt;&lt;ref name="ley195510"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/galaxymagazine-1955-10/Galaxy_1955_10#page/n61/mode/2up | title=For Your Information | work=Galaxy | date=October 1955 | accessdate=16 December 2013 | author=Ley, Willy | pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pat Williams, Jim Denney (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lSJIngvkCsAC ''How to Be Like Walt: Capturing the Disney Magic Every Day of Your Life''], p. 237, Health Communications Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-75730-231-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later (in 1959) von Braun published a short booklet, condensed from episodes that had appeared in ''[[This Week Magazine]]'' before—describing his updated concept of the first manned lunar landing.&lt;ref&gt;"Wernher von Braun (January 2000) "[[First Men to the Moon]]". Reprint by Henry Holt &amp; Co., Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-03030-295-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenario included only a single and relatively small spacecraft—a winged lander with a crew of only two experienced pilots who had already circumnavigated the Moon on an earlier mission. The brute-force [[direct ascent]] flight schedule used a rocket design with five sequential stages, loosely based on the [[Nova (rocket)|Nova]] designs that were under discussion at this time. After a night launch from a Pacific island, the first three stages would bring the spacecraft (with the two remaining upper stages attached) to terrestrial [[escape velocity]], with each burn creating an acceleration of 8–9 times [[standard gravity]]. Residual propellant in the third stage would be used for the deceleration intended to commence only a few hundred kilometers above the landing site in a crater near the lunar north pole. The fourth stage provided acceleration to lunar escape velocity, while the fifth stage would be responsible for a deceleration during return to the Earth to a residual speed that allows [[aerocapture]] of the spacecraft ending in a runway landing, much in the way of the [[Space Shuttle]]. One remarkable feature of this technical tale is that the engineer Wernher von Braun anticipated a medical phenomenon that would become apparent only years later: being a veteran astronaut with no history of serious adverse reactions to [[weightlessness]] offers no protection against becoming unexpectedly and violently [[spacesick]].

=== Religious conversion ===
In the first half of his life, von Braun was a nonpracticing, "perfunctory" Lutheran, whose affiliation was nominal and not taken seriously.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld,  Michael J. (2008) ''Wernher von Braun: Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War'', Vintage. p. 4; 230&lt;/ref&gt; As described by [[Ernst Stuhlinger]] and [[Frederick I. Ordway III]]: "Throughout his younger years, von Braun did not show signs of religious devotion, or even an interest in things related to the church or to biblical teachings. In fact, he was known to his friends as a 'merry heathen' (''fröhlicher Heide'')."&lt;ref&gt;Stuhlinger, Ernst &amp; Ira Ordway, Frederick. 1994. ''Wernher von Braun, crusader for space: a biographical memoir''. Krieger Pub, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1945 he explained his decision to surrender to the Western Allies, rather than Russians, as being influenced by a desire to share rocket technology with people who followed the Bible. In 1946,&lt;ref name=neu/&gt;{{rp|469}} he attended church in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], Texas, and underwent a [[religious conversion]] to [[evangelical Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Rocket Man"&gt;Mallon, Thomas (Oct. 22, 2007) [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/10/22/rocket-man "Rocket Man"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', Access date: January 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In an unnamed religious magazine he stated:

{{Quote|One day in [[Fort Bliss]], a neighbor called and asked if I would like to go to church with him. I accepted, because I wanted to see if the American church was just a country club as I'd been led to expect. Instead, I found a small, white frame building ... in the hot Texas sun on a browned-grass lot ... Together, these people make a live, vibrant community. This was the first time I really understood that religion was not a cathedral inherited from the past, or a quick prayer at the last minute. To be effective, a religion has to be backed up by discipline and effort.|von Braun&lt;ref name=neu&gt;Neufeld,  Michael J. (2007) ''Wernher von Braun: Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War'', Knoff, NY {{ISBN|978-0-30726-292-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|229–230}}}}

On the motives behind this conversion, [[Michael J. Neufeld]] is of the opinion that he turned to religion "to pacify his own conscience",&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Mark (2008) [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/a-20th-century-faust "A 20th-Century Faust"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160146/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/a-20th-century-faust |date=April 2, 2015 }}, ''[[American Scientist]]'', Access: January 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[University of Southampton]] scholar Kendrick Oliver said that von Braun was presumably moved "by a desire to find a new direction for his life after the moral chaos of his service for the Third Reich".&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Kendrick (2012) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tCPrLX8KOeAC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''To Touch the Face of God: The Sacred, the Profane, and the American Space Program, 1957–1975''], p. 23, Johns Hopkins University Press {{ISBN|978-1-42140-788-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having "concluded one bad bargain with the Devil, perhaps now he felt a need to have God securely at his side".&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, 2012, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life, he joined an Episcopal congregation,&lt;ref name="Rocket Man"/&gt; and became increasingly religious.&lt;ref&gt;Stuhlinger, Ernst &amp; Ira Ordway, Frederick. 1994. ''Wernher von Braun, crusader for space: a biographical memoir''. Krieger Pub, p. 270: "Those who knew him through the 1960s and 1970s noticed during these years that a new element began to surface in his conversations, and also in his speeches and his writings: a growing interest in religious thought."&lt;/ref&gt; He publicly spoke and wrote about the complementarity of [[science and religion]], the afterlife of the soul, and his belief in God.&lt;ref&gt;von Braun, Wernher (1963) "My Faith: A Space-Age Scientist Tells Why He Must Believe in God", (February 10, 1963) ''[[The American Weekly]]'', p. 2, New York: The Hearst Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See von Braun's speeches in ''The voice of Dr. Wernher Von Brain: An Anthology''. Apogee Books Publication; ed. by Irene E. Powell-Willhite: These touch "a variety of topics, including education, the cold war, religion, and the space program".&lt;/ref&gt; He stated, "Through science man strives to learn more of the mysteries of creation. Through religion he seeks to know the Creator."&lt;ref&gt;See the same article by von Braun, Wernher, published as "Science and religion", in ''[[Rome Daily American]]'', September 13, 1966. Available in ''[http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unification/Publications/naf/NAF-1966-10-00.pdf New Age Frontiersn]'' (Oct. 1966) ''United Family'', Vol- II, No. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; He was interviewed by the [[Assemblies of God]] pastor C. M. Ward, as stating, "The farther we probe into space, the greater my faith."&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Farther_We_Probe_Into_Space_the_Grea.html?id=3pa5HwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''"The Farther We Probe into Space, the Greater my Faith": C.M.Ward’s account of His Interview with Dr. Warner von Braun]'' (1966) Springfield, MO: Assemblies of God, 17 pp. Mini-pamphlet.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he met privately with evangelist [[Billy Graham]] and with the pacifist leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Bob (2013) ''Dr. Space: The Life of Wernher von Braun'', Ch. 1: "The Accursed Blessing", Naval Institute Press {{oclc|857079205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concepts for orbital warfare ===
Von Braun developed and published his space station concept during the very "coldest" time of the [[Cold War]], when the U.S. government for which he worked put the containment of the Soviet Union above everything else. The fact that his space station – if armed with missiles that could be easily adapted from those already available at this time – would give the United States space superiority in both orbital and [[Orbital bombardment|orbit-to-ground]] warfare did not escape him. In his popular writings, von Braun elaborated on them in several of his books and articles, but he took care to qualify such military applications as "particularly dreadful". This much less peaceful aspect of von Braun's "drive for space" has been reviewed by Michael J. Neufeld from the Space History Division of the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Neufeld MJ: "Space superiority: Wernher von Braun's campaign for a nuclear-armed space station, 1946–1956". ''Space Policy'' 2006; 22:52–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NASA career ===
[[File:Ap11-KSC-69P-632.jpg|thumb|Von Braun during Apollo 11 launch]]
The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] had been tasked with building a rocket to lift satellites into orbit, but the resulting [[Vanguard rocket]] launch system was unreliable. In 1957, with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]], a growing belief within the United States existed that it was lagging behind the Soviet Union in the emerging [[Space Race]]. American authorities then chose to use von Braun and his German team's experience with missiles to create an orbital launch vehicle. Wernher von Braun had such an idea originally proposed in 1954, but it was denied at the time.&lt;ref name=RM/&gt;

NASA was established by law on July 29, 1958. One day later, the 50th Redstone rocket was successfully launched from [[Johnston Atoll]] in the south Pacific as part of [[Operation Hardtack I]]. Two years later, NASA opened the Marshall Space Flight Center at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, and the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA) development team led by von Braun was transferred to NASA. In a face-to-face meeting with [[Herb York]] at the Pentagon, von Braun made it clear he would go to NASA only if development of the Saturn was allowed to continue.&lt;ref name="abma1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4206/ch2.htm |title=Stages to Saturn – The Saturn Building Blocks – THE ABMA TRANSFER |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presiding from July 1960 to February 1970, von Braun became the center's first director.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Von Braun's early years at NASA included a failed "four-inch flight" during which the first unmanned Mercury-Redstone rocket only rose a few inches before settling back onto the launch pad. The launch failure was later determined to be the result of a "power plug with one prong shorter than the other because a worker filed it to make it fit".  Because of the difference in the length of one prong, the launch system detected the difference in the power disconnection as a "cut-off signal to the engine".  The system stopped the launch, and the incident created a "nadir of morale in Project Mercury".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

After the flight of [[Mercury-Redstone 2]] in January 1961 experienced a string of problems, von Braun insisted on one more test before the Redstone could be deemed man-rated. His overly cautious nature brought about clashes with other people involved in the program, who argued that MR-2's technical issues were simple and had been resolved shortly after the flight. He overruled them, so a test mission involving a Redstone on a boilerplate capsule was flown successfully in March. Von Braun's stubbornness was blamed for the inability of the U.S. to launch a manned space mission before the Soviet Union, which ended up putting the first man in space the following month.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Phillips]] in the Launch Control Center following the successful [[Apollo 11]] liftoff on July 16, 1969]]
The Marshall Center's first major program was the development of [[Saturn rocket]]s to carry heavy [[Payload (air and space craft)|payloads]] into and beyond [[Earth orbit]]. From this, the [[Apollo program]] for manned Moon flights was developed. Wernher von Braun initially pushed for a flight engineering concept that called for an [[Earth orbit rendezvous]] technique (the approach he had argued for building his space station), but in 1962, he converted to the [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] concept that was subsequently realized.&lt;ref name="apmon"&gt;{{cite web |format=PDF |url=https://history.nasa.gov/Apollomon/apollo6.pdf |title=Concluding Remarks by Dr. Wernher von Braun about Mode Selection for the Lunar Landing Program |website=Lunar Orbit Rendezvous File |publisher=NASA Historical Reference Collection |date=June 7, 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Apollo, he worked closely with former Peenemünde teammate, [[Kurt H. Debus]], the first director of the Kennedy Space Center. His dream to help mankind set foot on the [[Moon]] became a reality on July 16, 1969, when a Marshall-developed [[Saturn V]] rocket launched the crew of [[Apollo 11]] on its historic eight-day mission. Over the course of the program, Saturn V rockets enabled six teams of astronauts to reach the surface of the Moon.

During the late 1960s, von Braun was instrumental in the development of the [[U.S. Space and Rocket Center]] in Huntsville. The desk from which he guided America's entry in the space race remains on display there. He also was instrumental in the launching of the experimental [[Applications Technology Satellite]]. He traveled to [[India]] and hoped that the program would be helpful for bringing a massive [[educational television]] project to help the poorest people in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Spangenburg &amp; Moser. 2009.

During the local summer of 1966–67, von Braun participated in a field trip to [[Antarctica]], organized for him and several other members of top NASA management.&lt;ref&gt;"Space Man's Look at Antarctica". ''Popular Science'', Vol. 190, No. 5, May 1967, pp. 114–116.&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of the field trip was to determine whether the experience gained by U.S. scientific and technological community during the exploration of Antarctic wastelands would be useful for the manned exploration of space. Von Braun was mainly interested in management of the scientific effort on Antarctic research stations, logistics, habitation, and life support, and in using the barren Antarctic terrain like the glacial dry valleys to test the equipment that one day would be used to look for signs of life on Mars and other worlds.

In an internal memo dated January 16, 1969,&lt;ref name="intan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/announcement_4.pdf |title=Adjustment to Marshall Organization, Announcement No. 4 |website=MSFC History Office |publisher=NASA Marshall Space Flight Center |date=January 16, 1969 |first=Wernher |last=von Braun |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621130244/http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/announcement_4.pdf |archivedate=June 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; von Braun had confirmed to his staff that he would stay on as a center director at Huntsville to head the [[Apollo Applications Program]]. He referred to this time as a moment in his life when he felt the strong need to pray, stating "I certainly prayed a lot before and during the crucial Apollo flights".&lt;ref&gt;Bergaust, Erik. 1976.

National Space Institute. p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, on occasion of the first Moon landing, he publicly expressed his optimism that the Saturn V carrier system would continue to be developed, advocating manned missions to Mars in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Next, Mars and Beyond |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901107,00.html |quote=Even as man prepared to take his first tentative extraterrestrial steps, other celestial adventures beckoned him. The shape and scope of the post-Apollo manned space program remained hazy, and a great deal depends on the safe and successful outcome of [[Apollo 11]]. Well before the lunar flight was launched, though, [[NASA]] was casting eyes on targets far beyond the Moon. The most inviting: the earth's close, and probably most hospitable, planetary neighbor. Given the same energy and dedication that took them to the Moon, says Wernher von Braun, Americans could land on Mars as early as 1982. |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=July 25, 1969 |accessdate=June 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, on March 1, 1970, von Braun and his family relocated to Washington, DC, when he was assigned the post of NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning at NASA Headquarters. After a series of conflicts associated with the truncation of the Apollo program, and facing severe budget constraints, von Braun retired from NASA on May 26, 1972. Not only had it become evident by this time that NASA and his visions for future U.S. space flight projects were incompatible, but also it was perhaps even more frustrating for him to see popular support for a continued presence of man in space wane dramatically once the goal to reach the Moon had been accomplished.

Von Braun also developed the idea of a [[United States Space Camp|Space Camp]] that would train children in fields of science and space technologies, as well as help their mental development much the same way sports camps aim at improving physical development.&lt;ref name="Neufeld 2007"/&gt;{{rp|354–355}}

=== Career after NASA ===
After leaving NASA, von Braun became Vice President for Engineering and Development at the aerospace company [[Fairchild (aircraft manufacturer)|Fairchild Industries]] in [[Germantown, Maryland|Germantown]], Maryland, on July 1, 1972.

In 1973, during a routine physical examination, von Braun was diagnosed with [[Renal cell carcinoma|kidney cancer]], which could not be controlled with the medical techniques available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;German sources mostly specify the cancer as renal, while American biographies unanimously just mention cancer. The time when von Braun learned about the disease is generally given as between 1973 and 1976. The characteristics of renal cell carcinoma, which has a bad prognosis even today, do not rule out either time limit.&lt;/ref&gt; Von Braun continued his work to the extent possible, which included accepting invitations to speak at colleges and universities, as he was eager to cultivate interest in human spaceflight and rocketry, particularly his desire to encourage the next generation of aerospace engineers.

Von Braun helped establish and promote the [[National Space Institute]], a precursor of the present-day [[National Space Society]], in 1975, and became its first president and chairman. In 1976, he became scientific consultant to [[Lutz Kayser]], the CEO of [[OTRAG]], and a member of the [[Daimler-Benz]] board of directors. However, his deteriorating health forced him to retire from Fairchild on December 31, 1976. When the 1975 [[National Medal of Science]] was awarded to him in early 1977, he was hospitalized, and unable to attend the White House ceremony.

== Engineering philosophy ==
Von Braun's insistence on further tests after [[Mercury-Redstone 2]] flew higher than planned has been identified as contributing to the Soviet Union's success in launching the first human in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Launius|first=Roger|title=To Reach the Higher Frontier: A History of U.S. Launch Vehicles|date=2002|publisher=University of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mercury-Redstone BD]] flight was successful, but took up the launch slot that could have put [[Alan Shepard]] into space three weeks ahead of [[Yuri Gagarin]]. His Soviet counterpart [[Sergei Korolev]] insisted on two successful flights with dogs before risking Gagarin's life on a manned attempt. The second test flight took place one day after the Mercury-Redstone BD mission.&lt;ref name="Neufeld 2007"/&gt;

Von Braun took a very conservative approach to engineering, designing with ample [[Factor of safety|safety factors]] and [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundant structure]]. This became a point of contention with other engineers, who struggled to keep vehicle weight down so that payload could be maximized. As noted above, his excessive caution likely led to the U.S. losing the race to put a man into space with the Soviets. [[Krafft Arnold Ehricke|Krafft Ehricke]] likened von Braun's approach to building the [[Brooklyn Bridge]].&lt;ref name="NASA SP-4404"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sloop | first = John L. | title= Liquid hydrogen as a propulsion fuel, 1945–1959 | series = The NASA history series | volume = SP-4404 | date = 1978 | url = https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19790008823.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}} Many at NASA headquarters jokingly referred to [[Marshall Space Flight Center|Marshall]] as the "[[Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company|Chicago Bridge and Iron Works]]", but acknowledged that the designs worked.&lt;ref name="NOVA 1999"&gt;{{cite episode | title = To the Moon | series = NOVA | date = July 13, 1999 | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2610tothemoon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative approach paid off when a fifth engine was added to the [[Saturn C-4]], producing the [[Saturn V]]. The C-4 design had a large crossbeam that could easily absorb the thrust of an additional engine.&lt;ref name="Neufeld 2007"/&gt;{{rp|371}}

== Personal life ==
[[File:Maria von Braun 6330121 edited.jpg|thumb|right|Maria von Braun, wife of Wernher von Braun]]

Von Braun had a charismatic personality and was known as a ladies' man. As a student in Berlin, he would often be seen in the evenings in the company of two girlfriends at once.&lt;ref name="Neufeld 2007"/&gt;{{rp|63}} He later had a succession of affairs within the secretarial and [[Human computer|computer]] pool at Peenemünde.&lt;ref name="Neufeld 2007"/&gt;{{rp|92–94}}

In January 1943, von Braun  became engaged to Dorothee Brill, a physical education teacher in Berlin, and sought permission from the [[RuSHA|SS Race and Settlement Office]] to marry. However, the engagement was broken due to his mother's opposition.&lt;ref name="Neufeld 2007"/&gt;{{rp|146–147}} Later in 1943, while preparing V-2 launch sites in northeastern France, von Braun had an affair in Paris with a French woman, who was imprisoned for collaboration after the War and became destitute.&lt;ref name="Neufeld 2007"/&gt;{{rp|147–148}}

During his stay at Fort Bliss, von Braun proposed marriage to Maria Luise von Quistorp (born {{birth date|1928|06|10}}), his maternal first cousin, in a letter to his father. On March 1, 1947, having received permission to go back to Germany and return with his bride, he married her in a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran church]] in [[Landshut]], Germany. Shortly after he converted to [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christianity]], his bride and he, as well as his father and mother, returned to New York on March 26, 1947. On December 9, 1948, the von Brauns' first daughter, Iris Careen, was born at Fort Bliss Army Hospital.&lt;ref name="time58"/&gt; The von Brauns had two more children, Margrit Cécile in 1952 and Peter Constantine in 1960.

On April 15, 1955, von Braun became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States.

* [[Apollo program]] director [[Samuel C. Phillips|Sam Phillips]] was quoted as saying that he did not think that the United States would have reached the Moon as quickly as it did without von Braun's help. Later, after discussing it with colleagues, he amended this to say that he did not believe the United States would have reached the Moon at all.&lt;ref name="Ward 2005"/&gt;{{rp|167}}&lt;!-- interview January 19, 2006 Alan Lawrie on ''The Space Show'', author of ''Saturn'', presumably in his book as well ---&gt;

* Von Braun received a total of 12 honorary doctorates, among them, on January 8, 1963, one from the [[Technical University of Berlin]] from which he had graduated.
* Von Braun was responsible for the creation of the Research Institute at the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]]. As a result of his vision, the university is one of the leading universities in the nation for NASA-sponsored research. The building housing the university's Research Institute was named in his honor, Von Braun Research Hall, in 2000.
* Several German cities ([[Bonn]], [[Neu-Isenburg]], [[Mannheim]], [[Mainz]]), and dozens of smaller towns have named streets after Wernher von Braun.
* The [[Von Braun Center]] (built 1975) in Huntsville is named in von Braun's honor.
* [[Von Braun Astronomical Society]] in Huntsville was founded as the Rocket City Astronomical Association by von Braun and was later renamed after him
* Scrutiny of von Braun's use of forced labor at [[Mittelwerk]] intensified again in 1984 when [[Arthur Rudolph]], one of his top affiliates from the A-4/V2 through to the Apollo projects, left the United States and was forced to renounce his citizenship in place of the alternative of being tried for war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=William E., Sr.| last=Winterstein| title=Secrets Of The Space Age| publisher=Robert D.

* A science- and engineering-oriented [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in [[Friedberg, Bavaria]] was named after Wernher von Braun in 1979. In response to rising criticism, a school committee decided in 1995, after lengthy deliberations, to keep the name but "to address von Braun's ambiguity in the advanced history classes". In 2012, [[Nazi concentration camp]] survivor David Salz gave a speech in Friedberg, calling out for the public to "Do everything to make this name disappear from this school!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/friedberg/Ein-Ort-der-das-Herz-zittern-laesst-id19317211.html| title=Gymnasium Friedberg: Ein Ort, der das Herz zittern lässt| trans-title=Friedberg Gymnasium: A place that can make the heart tremble| language=de| last=Rother| first=Marcel| newspaper=Augsburger Allgemeine|date= March 22, 2012| publisher=Presse-Druck- und Verlags-GmbH| location=Augsburg| access-date=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/-geburtstag-von-wernher-von-braun-tut-alles-damit-dieser-name-verschwindet-1.1315946| title=Streit um Wernher-von-Braun-Gymnasium "Tut alles, damit dieser Name verschwindet"| trans-title=Dispute over the Wernher von Braun Gymnasium "Do everything to make this name disappear"| language=de| last=Mayr| first=Stefan| newspaper=Süddeutschen Zeitung| date=March 23, 2012| publisher=Süddeutsche Zeitung GmbH| location=Munich| access-date=December 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, the school was finally renamed "Staatliches Gymnasium Friedberg" and distanced itself from the name von Braun, citing he was "no role-model for our pupils".

'''Film and television'''
Von Braun has been featured in a number of movies and television shows or series:
*"[[Man in Space]]" and "[[Man and the Moon]]", episodes of ''Disneyland'' which originally aired on March 9, 1955 and December 28, 1955, respectively.
* ''[[I Aim at the Stars]]'' (1960), also titled ''Wernher von Braun'' and ''Ich greife nach den Sternen'' ("I Reach for the Stars"); von Braun played by [[Curd Jürgens]], his wife Maria played by [[Victoria Shaw (actress)|Victoria Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Turner Classic Movies |title=I Aim at the Stars (1960) |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=27789 |accessdate=August 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was said that satirist [[Mort Sahl]] suggested the subtitle "But Sometimes I Hit London", the line appears in the film itself, spoken by actor James Daly who plays the cynical American press officer.
* ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' (TV, 1998): von Braun played by [[Norbert Weisser]].
* ''[[October Sky]]'' (1999): this film portrays U.S. rocket scientist [[Homer Hickam]], who as a teenager admired von Braun (played by Joe Digaetano). The film's title, ''October Sky'', is an [[anagram]] of the autobiography it was based on: ''[[Rocket Boys]]''.
* ''[[Space Race (TV series)|Space Race]]'' (TV, [[BBC]] co-production with [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] (Germany), Channel One TV (Russia) and [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] TV (USA), 2005): von Braun played by [[Richard Dillane]].

Several fictional characters have been modeled on von Braun:
* ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' (1964): Dr Strangelove is usually held to be based at least partly on von Braun.&lt;ref&gt;Neufield, ''Von Braun'', p. 406. Dr Strangelove was widely held to be a composite of [[Edward Teller]], [[Herman Kahn]], and von Braun; but only von Braun shared Strangelove's Nazi past.&lt;/ref&gt;

In print media:
* In [[Warren Ellis]]'s graphic novel ''[[Ministry of Space]]'', von Braun is a supporting character, settling in Britain after World War II, and being essential for the realization of the British space program.
* In [[Jonathan Hickman]]'s comic book series ''[[The Manhattan Projects]]'', von Braun is a major character.

In literature:
* ''[[The Good German]]'' by Joseph Kanon. Von Braun and other scientists are said to have been implicated in the use of slave labor at Peenemünde; their transfer to the U.S. forms part of the narrative.
* ''[[Space (novel)|Space]]'' by [[James Michener]]. Von Braun and other German scientists are brought to the U.S. and form a vital part of the U.S. efforts to reach space.
* ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' by Thomas Pynchon. The novel involves British intelligence attempting to avert and predict V-2 rocket attacks. The work even includes a gyroscopic equation for the V2. The first portion of the novel, "Beyond The Zero", begins with a quotation from von Braun: "Nature does not know extinction; all it knows is transformation. Everything science has taught me, and continues to teach me, strengthens my belief in the continuity of our spiritual existence after death."
* ''V-S Day'' by [[Allen Steele]] is a 2014 [[alternate history]] novel in which the [[space race]] occurs during World War II between teams led by [[Robert H. Goddard]] and von Braun.
* ''[[Moonglow: A Novel|Moonglow]]'' by [[Michael Chabon]] (2016) includes a fictionalized description of the search for and capture of Von Braun by the US Army, and his role in the Nazi V-2 program and subsequently in the US space program.

In theatre:
* ''Rocket City, Alabam','' a stage play by [[Mark Saltzman#Theater|Mark Saltzman]], weaves von Braun's real life with a fictional plot in which a young [[Jewish]] woman in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] becomes aware of his Nazi past and tries to inspire awareness and outrage.
