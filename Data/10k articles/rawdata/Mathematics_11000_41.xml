'''39''' ('''thirty-nine''') is the [[natural number]] following [[38 (number)|38]] and preceding [[40 (number)|40]].

== In mathematics ==
[[File:F26A graph.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[F26A graph]] has 39 edges, all equivalent.]]
*'''Thirty-nine''' is the sum of consecutive [[Prime number|primes]] (3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13) and also is the product of the first and the last of those consecutive primes. Among small semiprimes only three other integers (10, 155, and 371) share this attribute.  39 also is the sum of the first three powers of [[3 (number)|3]] (3{{sup|1}} + 3{{sup|2}} + 3{{sup|3}}). Given 39, the [[Mertens function]] returns [[0 (number)|0]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sloane's A028442 : Numbers n such that Mertens' function is zero|url=https://oeis.org/A028442|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*39 is the smallest natural number which has three partitions into three parts which all give the same product when multiplied: {25, 8, 6}, {24, 10, 5}, {20, 15, 4}.
*39 is the 12th distinct [[semiprime]] and the 4th in the {3.q} family. It is the last member of the third distinct biprime pair (38,39).
*39 has an [[aliquot sum]] of 17 which is itself a prime. 39 is the 4th member of the 17-aliquot tree. It is a [[perfect totient number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sloane's A082897 : Perfect totient numbers|url=https://oeis.org/A082897|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The thirteenth [[Perrin number]] is 39, which comes after 17, 22, 29 (it is the sum of the first two mentioned).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sloane's A001608 : Perrin sequence|url=https://oeis.org/A001608|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Since the greatest prime factor of 39&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 1522 is 761, which is obviously more than 39 twice, 39 is a [[Størmer number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sloane's A005528 : Størmer numbers|url=https://oeis.org/A005528|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|accessdate=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[F26A graph]] is a [[symmetric graph]] with 39 edges.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1433">In financial [[econometrics]], an '''autoregressive conditional duration''' ('''ACD''', Engle and Russell (1998)) model considers irregularly spaced and autocorrelated intertrade durations. ACD is analogous to [[GARCH]]. Indeed, in a continuous double [[auction]] (a common trading mechanism in many [[financial markets]]) waiting times between two consecutive trades vary at random.

==Definition==
Specifically, let &lt;math&gt; ~\tau_t~ &lt;/math&gt; denote the duration 
(the waiting time between consecutive trades) and
assume that &lt;math&gt; ~\tau_t=\theta_t z_t ~&lt;/math&gt;, where
&lt;math&gt; z_t &lt;/math&gt; are independent and identically distributed random variables, positive and with &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}(z_t) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and where
the series &lt;math&gt; ~\theta_t~ &lt;/math&gt; is given by

&lt;math&gt; \theta_t = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \tau_{t-1} + \cdots + \alpha_q \tau_{t-q} + \beta_1 \theta_{t-1} + \cdots + \beta_p\theta_{t-p} = \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^q \alpha_i \tau_{t-i} + \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_i \theta_{t-i} &lt;/math&gt;

and where &lt;math&gt; ~\alpha_0&gt;0~ &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \alpha_i\ge 0&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt; \beta_i \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;~i&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1947">In [[mathematics]], an '''axiom of countability''' is a property of certain [[mathematical object]]s (usually in a [[Category (mathematics)|category]]) that asserts the existence of a [[countable|countable set]] with certain properties. Without such an axiom, such a set might not provably exist.

==Important examples==
Important countability axioms for [[topological space]]s include:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Modern General Topology|series=North-Holland Mathematical Library|first=J.-I.|last=Nagata|edition=3rd|publisher=Elsevier|year=1985|isbn=9780080933795|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecvd8dCAQp0C&amp;pg=PA104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[sequential space]]: a set is open if every [[sequence]] [[limit of a sequence|convergent]] to a [[point (geometry)|point]] in the set is eventually in the set
*[[first-countable space]]: every point has a countable [[neighbourhood system|neighbourhood basis]] (local  base)
*[[second-countable space]]: the topology has a countable [[base (topology)|base]]
*[[separable space]]: there exists a countable [[dense (topology)|dense]] subset
*[[Lindelöf space]]: every [[open cover]] has a countable [[subcover]]
*[[σ-compact space]]: there exists a countable cover by compact spaces

==Relationships with each other==
These axioms are related to each other in the following ways:
*Every first countable space is sequential.
*Every second-countable space is first-countable, separable, and Lindelöf.
*Every σ-compact space is Lindelöf.
*Every [[metric space]] is first countable.
*For metric spaces second-countability, separability, and the Lindelöf property are all equivalent.
 
==Related concepts==
Other examples of mathematical objects obeying axioms of countability include [[sigma-finite]] [[measure (mathematics)|measure space]]s, and [[lattice (order)|lattice]]s of [[countable type]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4928">The '''Beltrami identity''', named after [[Eugenio Beltrami]], is a simplified and less general version of the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] in the [[calculus of variations]].

The Euler–Lagrange equation serves to extremize action  [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]]s of the form&lt;ref name='CourHilb1953'&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Courant R, Hilbert D | author-link = Richard Courant | author2-link = David Hilbert | title = Methods of Mathematical Physics | volume = Vol. I | edition = First English | publisher = Interscience Publishers, Inc. | year = 1953 | location = New York | page = 184 | isbn = 978-0471504474}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-10-22 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;I[u]=\int_a^b L[x,u(x),u'(x)] \, dx \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''a'', ''b''}} are [[Constant (mathematics)|constants]] and {{math|''u''&amp;prime;(x) {{=}} ''du'' / ''dx''}}.

For the special case of {{math|∂''L'' / ∂''x'' {{=}} 0}}, the Euler–Lagrange equation reduces to the Beltrami identity,&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, Eric W. [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Euler-LagrangeDifferentialEquation.html "Euler-Lagrange Differential Equation."]  From [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ MathWorld]--A Wolfram Web Resource. See Eq. (5).&lt;/ref&gt;

|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}
where {{math|''C''}} is a constant.&lt;ref&gt;Thus, the [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transform]] of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]], the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]], is constant on the dynamical path.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation==
The following derivation of the Beltrami identity&lt;ref&gt;This derivation of the Beltrami identity corresponds to the one at — Weisstein, Eric W. [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BeltramiIdentity.html "Beltrami Identity."] From [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ MathWorld]--A Wolfram Web Resource.&lt;/ref&gt; starts with the Euler–Lagrange equation, 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial L}{\partial u} =\frac{d}{dx} \frac{\partial L}{\partial u'} \, . &lt;/math&gt;
Multiplying both sides by {{math|''u''&amp;prime;}},
:&lt;math&gt; u'\frac{\partial L}{\partial u} =u'\frac{d}{dx} \frac{\partial L}{\partial u'} \, . &lt;/math&gt;

According to the [[chain rule]],
:&lt;math&gt; {dL \over dx} = {\partial L \over \partial u}u' +  {\partial L \over \partial u'}u'' + {\partial L \over \partial x}  \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''u''&amp;prime;&amp;prime; {{=}} ''du''&amp;prime;/''dx'' {{=}} ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''u'' / ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

Rearranging this yields
:&lt;math&gt; u' {\partial L \over \partial u} = {dL \over dx}  - {\partial L \over \partial u'}u'' - {\partial L \over \partial x} \, . &lt;/math&gt;
Thus, substituting this expression for {{math|''u''&amp;prime; ∂''L''/∂''u''}}  into the second equation of this derivation,  
:&lt;math&gt; {dL \over dx}  - {\partial L \over \partial u'}u'' - {\partial L \over \partial x} -u'\frac{d}{dx} \frac{\partial L}{\partial u'} = 0 \, . &lt;/math&gt;
By the product rule, the last term is re-expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;u'\frac{d}{dx}\frac{\partial L}{\partial u'}=\frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial u'}u' \right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial u'}u'' \, , &lt;/math&gt;
and rearranging,
:&lt;math&gt; {d \over dx} \left( { L - u'\frac{\partial L}{\partial u'} } \right) = {\partial L \over \partial x}  \, . &lt;/math&gt;

For the case of {{math|∂''L'' / ∂''x'' {{=}} 0}}, this reduces to 
:&lt;math&gt; {d \over dx} \left( { L - u'\frac{\partial L}{\partial u'} } \right) = 0 \, , &lt;/math&gt;
so that taking the [[antiderivative]] results in the Beltrami identity,
:&lt;math&gt;  L - u'\frac{\partial L}{\partial u'}   = C \, , &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''C''}} is a constant.

== Application ==

An example of an application of the Beltrami identity is the [[Brachistochrone problem]], which involves finding the curve {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''y''(''x'')}} that minimizes the integral
:&lt;math&gt; I[y] = \int_0^a \sqrt { {1+y'^{\, 2}} \over y } dx \, . &lt;/math&gt;
The integrand 
:&lt;math&gt; L(y,y') = \sqrt{ {1+y'^{\, 2}} \over y } &lt;/math&gt;
does not depend explicitly on the variable of integration {{math|''x''}}, so the Beltrami identity applies,
:&lt;math&gt;L-y'\frac{\partial L}{\partial y'}=C \, .&lt;/math&gt; 
Substituting for {{math|''L''}} and simplifying,
:&lt;math&gt; y(1+y'^{\, 2}) = 1/C^2  ~~\text {(constant)} \, , &lt;/math&gt;
which can be solved with the result put in the form of [[parametric equation]]s 
:&lt;math&gt;x = A(\phi - \sin \phi) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = A(1 - \cos \phi) &lt;/math&gt;
with {{math|''A''}} being half the above constant, 1/(2''C'' ²), and {{math|''&amp;phi;''}} being a variable. These are the parametric equations for a [[cycloid]].&lt;ref name='MW307'&gt;This solution of the Brachistochrone problem corresponds to the one in — {{cite book | last1 = Mathews | first1 = Jon | last2 = Walker | first2 = RL | title = Mathematical Methods of Physics | publisher = W.

In mathematics, the '''big q-Legendre polynomials''' are an [[orthogonal polynomials|orthogonal family]] of polynomials defined in terms of [[basic hypergeometric function|Heine's basic hypergeometric series]] as&lt;ref&gt;Roelof Koekoek, Peter Lesky, Rene Swattouw,Hypergeometric Orthogonal Polynomials and Their q-Analogues, p 443,Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle   P_n(x;c;q)={}_3\phi_2(q^{-n},q^{n+1},x;q,cq;q,q) &lt;/math&gt;.

They obey the orthogonality relation

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{cq}^q P_m(x;c;q)P_n(x;c;q) \, dx=q(1-c)\frac{1-q}{1-q^{2n+1}}\frac{(c^{-1}q;q)_n}{(cq;q)_n}(-cq^2)^n q^{n \choose 2}\delta_{mn}&lt;/math&gt;

and have the limiting behavior

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\lim_{q \to 1} P_n(x;0;q)=P_n(2x-1)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th [[Legendre polynomial]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

'''Blagovest Hristov Sendov''' ({{lang-bg|Благовест Сендов}})  (born 8 February 1932) is a [[Bulgarians|Bulgaria]]n [[diplomat]], [[mathematician]] and [[politician]].

==Early life and education==
He was born in [[Asenovgrad]], [[Bulgaria]].{{sfn|Prodanov, Todorov, Avramov &amp; Ivanova|2009|p=487}}

==Career==

===Academic===
Sendov was the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of [[Sofia University]], located in [[Sofia]], Bulgaria; and the Deputy Chairman of [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]], also located in Sofia. He has more than 200 publications in fields related to mathematics and computer science.{{sfn|Prodanov, Todorov, Avramov &amp; Ivanova|2009|p=488}}

===Post-1989 political career===

Sendov took part as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] in the [[Bulgarian presidential election, 1992|1992 Bulgarian presidential election]] with Ognyan Saparev as his running mate, finishing in 4th place with 2.24% of the votes.{{sfn|Prodanov, Todorov, Avramov &amp; Ivanova|2009|p=489}}

===National Assembly of Bulgaria===
From 1995 to 1997, he was the [[Chairperson of the National Assembly of Bulgaria]]; and from 1997 to 2002, he was the its Deputy Chairperson. His candidacy for that position{{Clarify|date=January 2011|reason=unclear which position - "chairman" or "deputy chairman".  also, seems unusual to move from "chair" to "deputy chair".  if this is true (see phrasing of just-earlier drafts), might merit some explanatory prose}}  was supported by the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]] (BSP), the successor to the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] (BCP).  Although never a member of the BCP, Sendov had close ties to former Bulgarian [[communism|communist]] [[dictator]] [[Todor Zhivkov]].

The rightist [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of the Democratic Forces]] removed him temporarily from that duty in 2000 when Sendov cosigned, together with four members of the BSP, a letter to the [[President of Israel|Israeli president]] asking that portraits of the [[Bulgarian Royal Family]] (from the 1940s){{Clarify|date=January 2011|reason=what is from the 1940s?  portraits from the 1940s of the royal family?}} be removed from a memorial in Israel. This memorial commemorates that all [[Bulgarian Jews]] were saved from deportation to [[Internment#Concentration camp|concentration camps]] during [[World War II]].

===Bulgaria ambassador to Japan===
Sendov was [[Bulgarian ambassador to Japan]] from 2004 to 2009.

===Sendov's conjecture===
Sendov's name is attached to one of the major unsolved problems in the study of [[polynomial]] zeros, [[Sendov's conjecture]] (sometimes incorrectly known as Ilieff's conjecture).{{sfn|Prodanov, Todorov, Avramov &amp; Ivanova|2009|p=488}}

===Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts===
In 2000 he was elected as a member of [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], an academic institution located in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18070">[[File:Extreme points.svg|thumb|right|The convex hull of the red set is the blue and red [[convex set]].]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''convex hull''' or '''convex envelope''' or '''convex closure''' of a set ''X'' of points in the [[Euclidean plane]] or in a [[Euclidean space]] (or, more generally, in an [[affine space]] over the reals) is the smallest [[convex set]] that contains ''X''. For instance, when ''X'' is a [[Bounded set|bounded]] subset of the plane, the convex hull may be visualized as the shape enclosed by a rubber band stretched around ''X''.&lt;ref name="rubber band"&gt;{{harvtxt|de Berg|van Kreveld|Overmars|Schwarzkopf|2000}}, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally, the convex hull may be defined either as the intersection of all convex sets containing ''X'', or as the set of all [[convex combination]]s of points in&amp;nbsp;''X''. With the latter definition, convex hulls may be extended from Euclidean spaces to arbitrary [[real vector space]]s; they may also be generalized further, to [[oriented matroid]]s.{{sfnp|Knuth|1992}}

The [[algorithm]]ic problem of finding the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane or other low-dimensional Euclidean spaces is one of the fundamental problems of [[computational geometry]].

A set of points is defined to be [[convex set|convex]] if it contains the line segments connecting each pair of its points. The convex hull of a given set ''X'' may be defined as
#The (unique) minimal convex set containing ''X''
#The intersection of all convex sets containing ''X''
#The set of all [[convex combination]]s of points in ''X''.
#The union of all [[simplex|simplices]] with vertices in ''X''.

It is not obvious that the first definition makes sense: why should there exist a unique minimal convex set containing ''X'', for every ''X''? However, the second definition, the intersection of all convex sets containing ''X'', is well-defined, and it is a subset of every other convex set ''Y'' that contains ''X'', because ''X'' is included among the sets being intersected. Thus, it is exactly the unique minimal convex set containing ''X''. Each convex set containing ''X'' must (by the assumption that it is convex) contain all convex combinations of points in ''X'', so the set of all convex combinations is contained in the intersection of all convex sets containing ''X''. Conversely, the set of all convex combinations is itself a convex set containing ''X'', so it also contains the intersection of all convex sets containing ''X'', and therefore the sets given by these two definitions must be equal.
In fact, according to [[Carathéodory's theorem (convex hull)|Carathéodory's theorem]], if ''X'' is a subset of an ''N''-dimensional vector space, convex combinations of at most ''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 points are sufficient in the definition above. Therefore, the convex hull of a set ''X'' of three or more points in the plane is the union of all the [[triangle]]s determined by triples of points from ''X'', and more generally in ''N''-dimensional space the convex hull is the union of the [[simplex|simplices]] determined by at most ''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 vertices from X.

If the convex hull of ''X'' is a [[closed set]] (as happens, for instance, if ''X'' is a [[finite set]] or more generally a [[compact set]]), then it is the intersection of all closed [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]]s containing ''X''. The [[hyperplane separation theorem]] proves that in this case, each point not in the convex hull can be separated from the convex hull by a half-space. However, there exist convex sets, and convex hulls of sets, that cannot be represented in this way. Open halfspaces are such examples.

More abstractly, the convex-hull operator Conv() has the characteristic properties of a [[closure operator]]:
*It is ''extensive'', meaning that the convex hull of every set ''X'' is a superset of ''X''.
*It is ''[[Monotone function#Monotonicity in order theory|non-decreasing]]'', meaning that, for every two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' with ''X''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''Y'', the convex hull of ''X'' is a subset of the convex hull of&amp;nbsp;''Y''.
*It is ''[[idempotence|idempotent]]'', meaning that for every ''X'', the convex hull of the convex hull of ''X'' is the same as the convex hull of&amp;nbsp;''X''.

==Convex hull of a finite point set==
[[File:Convex hull.png|thumb|Convex hull of some points in the plane]]

The convex hull of a [[finite set|finite]] point set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all [[convex combination]]s of its points. In a convex combination, each point &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is assigned a weight or coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; in such a way that the coefficients are all non-negative and sum to one,  and these weights are used to compute a [[weighted average]] of the points. For each choice of coefficients, the resulting convex combination is a point in the convex hull, and the whole convex hull can be formed by choosing coefficients in all possible ways. Expressing this as a single formula, the convex hull is the set:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Conv}(S)=\left\{\left.\sum_{i=1}^{|S|} \alpha_i x_i\  \right| (\forall i: \alpha_i\ge 0)\wedge \sum_{i=1}^{|S|} \alpha_i=1 \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

The convex hull of a finite point set &lt;math&gt;S \subsetneq \R^n&lt;/math&gt; forms a [[convex polygon]] when ''n'' = 2, or more generally a [[convex polytope]] in &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;. Each point &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; that is not in the convex hull of the other points (that is, such that &lt;math&gt;x_i \notin \operatorname{Conv}(S\setminus\{x_i\})&lt;/math&gt;) is called a [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Conv}(S)&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, every convex polytope in &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; is the convex hull of its vertices.

[[File:ConvexHull.svg|thumb|Convex hull of a finite set: elastic-band analogy]]
[[File:3D_Convex_Hull.tiff|thumb|3D convex hull of 120 point cloud]]

If the points of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are all on a [[Line (geometry)|line]], the convex hull is the [[line segment]] joining the outermost two points. When the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[empty set|nonempty]] [[finite set|finite subset]] of the [[Euclidean geometry|plane]] (that is, [[two-dimensional]]), we may imagine stretching a [[rubber band]] so that it surrounds the entire set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and then releasing it, allowing it to contract; when it becomes taut, it encloses the convex hull of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="rubber band"/&gt;

In two dimensions, the convex hull is sometimes partitioned into two polygonal chains, the upper hull and the lower hull, stretching between the leftmost and rightmost points of the hull. More generally, for points in any dimension in general position, each [[Facet (geometry)|facet]] of the convex hull is either oriented upwards (separating the hull from points directly above it) or downwards; the union of the upward-facing facets forms a topological disk, the upper hull, and similarly the union of the downward-facing facets forms the lower hull.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|de Berg|van Kreveld|Overmars|Schwarzkopf|2000}}, p. 6. The idea of partitioning the hull into two chains comes from an efficient variant of [[Graham scan]] by {{harvtxt|Andrew|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computation of convex hulls==
{{Main article|Convex hull algorithms}}

In computational geometry, a number of algorithms are known for computing the convex hull for a finite set of points and for other geometric objects.

Computing the convex hull means constructing an unambiguous, efficient [[data structure|representation]] of the required convex shape. The complexity of the corresponding algorithms is usually estimated in terms  of '''''n''''', the number of input points, and '''''h''''', the number of points on the convex hull.

For points in two and three dimensions, [[output-sensitive algorithm]]s are known that compute the convex hull in time O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''h''). For dimensions&amp;nbsp;''d'' higher than 3, the time for computing the convex hull is &lt;math&gt;O(n^{\lfloor d/2\rfloor})&lt;/math&gt;, matching the worst-case output complexity of the problem.{{sfnp|Chazelle|1993}}

==Minkowski addition and convex hulls==
{{See also|Minkowski addition|Shapley–Folkman lemma}}
[[File:Minkowski sum graph - vector version.svg|thumb|alt=Three squares are shown in the nonnegative quadrant of the Cartesian plane. The square Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;{{nbsp}}={{nbsp}}[0,1]×[0,1] is green.

The operation of taking convex hulls behaves well with respect to the Minkowski addition of sets.

* In a real vector-space, the ''[[Minkowski addition|Minkowski&amp;nbsp;sum]]'' of two (non-empty) sets &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the [[sumset|set]] &lt;math&gt;S_1 + S_2&lt;/math&gt; formed by the addition of vectors element-wise from the summand-sets
::&lt;math&gt;S_1 + S_2 = \{ x_1 + x_2 : x_1 \in S_1, x_2 \in S_2\}.&lt;/math&gt;
:More generally, the ''Minkowski sum'' of a finite&amp;nbsp;family of (non-empty) sets &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;!-- defined to be --&gt; the set &lt;!-- of vectors --&gt; formed by element-wise addition of vectors&lt;!--  from the summand-sets --&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\sum S_n = \left \{ \sum x_n : x_n \in S_n \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- For Minkowski&amp;nbsp;addition, the ''zero set''&amp;nbsp;{0} containing only the [[null vector|zero&amp;nbsp;vector]]&amp;nbsp;0 has [[identity element|special importance]]: For every non-empty subset&amp;nbsp;S of a vector space
: S&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{0} = S;
in algebraic terminology, the zero&amp;nbsp;vector&amp;nbsp;0 is the [[identity element]] of Minkowski addition (on the collection of non-empty sets).&lt;ref&gt;
The [[empty set]] is important in Minkowski addition, because the empty&amp;nbsp;set annihilates every other subset: For every  subset&amp;nbsp;S of a vector space, its sum with the empty set is empty
: S+∅ = ∅.
&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
* For all subsets &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; of a real vector-space, the convex hull of their Minkowski sum is the Minkowski sum of their convex hulls
::&lt;math&gt;\text{Conv}(S_1 +S_2) = \text{Conv}(S_1) + \text{Conv}(S_2).&lt;/math&gt;
:This result holds more generally for each finite&amp;nbsp;collection of non-empty sets
::&lt;math&gt;\text{Conv}\left (\sum S_n \right ) = \sum \text{Conv}(S_n).&lt;/math&gt;
:In other words, the [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s of Minkowski summation and of forming convex hulls are [[commutativity|commuting]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Krein|Šmulian|1940}}, Theorem&amp;nbsp;3, pages&amp;nbsp;562–563.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;For the commutativity of [[Minkowski sum|Minkowski addition]] and convexification, see Theorem&amp;nbsp;1.1.2 (pages&amp;nbsp;2–3) in {{harvtxt|Schneider|1993}}; this reference discusses much of the literature on the convex hulls of [[Minkowski addition|Minkowski]] [[sumset]]s in its "Chapter&amp;nbsp;3 Minkowski addition" (pages&amp;nbsp;126–196).&lt;/ref&gt;

These results show that ''Minkowski addition'' differs from the [[union (set theory)|''union ''operation]] of [[set theory]]; indeed, the union of two convex&amp;nbsp;sets need ''not'' be convex: The [[subset|inclusion]] 

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Conv}(S) \cup \text{Conv}(T) \subseteq \text{Conv}(S \cup T)&lt;/math&gt;

is generally strict. The convex-hull operation is needed for the set of convex sets to form a &lt;!-- complete  --&gt;[[lattice (order)|lattice]], in which the [[join and meet|"join" operation]] is the convex hull of the union of two convex sets:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Conv}(S) \vee \text{Conv}(T) = \text{Conv}(S \cup T) =  \text{Conv}(\text{Conv}(S) \cup \text{Conv}(T)).&lt;/math&gt;

== Relations to other structures ==

The [[Delaunay triangulation]] of a point set and its [[dual (mathematics)|dual]], the [[Voronoi diagram]], are mathematically  related to convex hulls: the Delaunay triangulation of a point set in &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; can be viewed as the projection of a convex hull in &lt;math&gt;\R^{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;{{sfnp|Brown|1979}}

Topologically, the convex hull of an [[open set]] is always itself open, and the convex hull of a [[compact set]] is always itself compact; however, there exist closed sets for which the convex hull is not closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|2003}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the closed set

:&lt;math&gt;\left  \{ (x,y) \left  | y\ge \frac{1}{1+x^2}\right\} \right.&lt;/math&gt;

has the open [[upper half-plane]] as its convex hull.

== Applications ==
The problem of finding convex hulls finds its practical applications in [[pattern recognition]], [[image processing]], [[statistics]], [[geographic information system]], [[game theory]], construction of [[phase diagrams]], and [[static code analysis]] by [[abstract interpretation]]. It also serves as a tool, a building block for a number of other computational-geometric algorithms such as the [[rotating calipers]] method for computing the [[width]] and [[diameter]] of a point set.

The convex hull is commonly known as the minimum convex polygon (MCP) in [[ethology]], where it is a classic, though perhaps simplistic, approach in estimating an animal's [[home range]] based on points where the animal has been observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kernohan|Gitzen|Millspaugh|2001}}, p. 137–140&lt;/ref&gt; [[Outlier]]s can make the MCP excessively large, which has motivated relaxed approaches that contain only a subset of the observations (e.g., find an MCP that contains at least 95% of the points).&lt;ref&gt;Examples: The [http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/addons/v.adehabitat.mcp.html v.adehabitat.mcp] [[GRASS GIS|GRASS]] module and [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adehabitatHR/adehabitatHR.pdf adehabitatHR] [[R (programming language)|R]] package with percentage parameters for MCP calculation.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9221">In [[mathematics]], a '''Cullen number''' is a [[natural number]] of the form &lt;math&gt;n \cdot 2^n + 1&lt;/math&gt; (written &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt;). Cullen numbers were first studied by [[James Cullen (mathematician)|James Cullen]] in 1905. Cullen numbers are special cases of [[Proth number]]s.

== Properties ==
In 1976 [[Christopher Hooley]] showed that the [[natural density]] of positive integers &lt;math&gt;n \leq x&lt;/math&gt; for which ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a prime is of the order ''o(x)'' for &lt;math&gt;x\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;. In that sense, [[almost all]] Cullen numbers are [[composite number|composite]].&lt;ref name=EPSW94&gt;{{cite book | last1=Everest | first1=Graham | last2=van der Poorten | first2=Alf | author2-link=Alfred van der Poorten | last3=Shparlinski | first3=Igor | last4=Ward | first4=Thomas | title=Recurrence sequences | series=Mathematical Surveys and Monographs | volume=104 | location=[[Providence, RI]] | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2003 | isbn=0-8218-3387-1 | zbl=1033.11006 | page=94 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hooley's proof was reworked by Hiromi Suyama to show that it works for any sequence of numbers ''n'' · 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+''a''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers, and in particular also for [[Woodall number]]s. The only known '''Cullen primes''' are those for ''n'' equal:
: 1, 141, 4713, 5795, 6611, 18496, 32292, 32469, 59656, 90825, 262419, 361275, 481899, 1354828, 6328548, 6679881 {{OEIS|id=A005849}}.
Still, it is conjectured that there are infinitely many Cullen primes.

{{As of|2016|02}}, the largest known Cullen prime is 6679881&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;6679881&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. It is a [[megaprime]] with 2,010,852 digits and was discovered by Magnus Bergman, a [[PrimeGrid]] participant from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://primes.utm.edu/primes/page.php?id=89536 |title=The Prime Database: 6679881*2^6679881+1 |work=Chris Caldwell's The Largest Known Primes Database |accessdate=December 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Cullen number ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is divisible by ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 if ''p'' is a [[prime number]] of the form 8''k''&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;3; furthermore, it follows from [[Fermat's little theorem]] that if ''p'' is an odd prime, then p divides ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''m''(''k'')&lt;/sub&gt; for each ''m''(''k'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'')&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;(''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'' (for ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0). It has also been shown that the prime number ''p'' divides ''C''&lt;sub&gt;(''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt; when the [[Jacobi symbol]] (2&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''p'') is &amp;minus;1, and that ''p'' divides ''C''&lt;sub&gt;(3''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sub&gt; when the Jacobi symbol (2&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''p'') is +1.

It is unknown whether there exists a prime number ''p'' such that ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is also prime.

== Generalizations ==

Sometimes, a '''generalized Cullen number base ''b''''' is defined to be a number of the form ''n'' × ''b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' + 1, where ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''b''; if a prime can be written in this form, it is then called a '''generalized Cullen prime'''. [[Woodall number]]s are sometimes called '''Cullen numbers of the second kind'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marques|first=Diego|year=2014|title=On Generalized Cullen and Woodall Numbers That are Also Fibonacci Numbers|url=https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL17/Marques/marques5r2.pdf|journal=Journal of Integer Sequences|volume=17|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Fermat's little theorem]], if there is a prime ''p'' such that ''n'' is divisible by ''p'' - 1 and ''n'' + 1 is divisible by ''p'' (especially, when ''n'' = ''p'' - 1) and ''p'' does not divide ''b'', then ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; must be congruent to 1 mod ''p'' (since ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a power of ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''p'' - 1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''p'' - 1&lt;/sup&gt; is congruent to 1 mod ''p''). Thus, ''n'' × ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 is divisible by ''p'', so it is not prime. For example, if some ''n'' congruent to 2 mod 6 (i.e. 2, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, ...), ''n'' × ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 is prime, then ''b'' must be divisible by 3 (except ''b'' = 1).

Least ''n'' such that ''n'' × ''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 is prime are (with question marks if this term is currently unknown)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guenter.loeh.name/gc/status.html |title=Generalized Cullen primes |date=6 May 2017 |last=Löh |first=Günter }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harvey563.tripod.com/GClist.txt |title=List of generalized Cullen primes base 101 to 10000 |date=6 May 2017 |last=Harvey |first=Steven }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Graph families defined by their automorphisms}}
In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], a '''distance-transitive graph''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] such that, given any two vertices ''v'' and ''w'' at any [[Distance (graph theory)|distance]] ''i'', and any other two vertices ''x'' and ''y'' at the same distance, there is an [[Graph automorphism|automorphism]] of the graph that carries ''v'' to ''x'' and ''w'' to&amp;nbsp;''y''. Distance-transitive graphs were first defined in 1971 by [[Norman L. Biggs]] and D. H. Smith.

A distance-transitive graph is interesting partly because it has a large [[automorphism group]].  Some interesting [[finite group]]s are the automorphism groups of distance-transitive graphs, especially of those whose diameter is&amp;nbsp;2.

== Examples ==
Some first examples of families of distance-transitive graphs include:
* The [[Johnson graph|Johnson graphs]].
* The [[Grassmann graph|Grassmann graphs]].
* The [[Hamming graph|Hamming Graphs]].
* The [[folded cube graph]]s.
* The square [[rook's graph]]s.
The simplest [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] family of examples of distance-transitive graphs is the [[hypercube graph]]s.

== Classification of cubic distance-transitive graphs ==
After introducing them in 1971, [[Norman L. Biggs|Biggs]] and Smith showed that there are only 12 finite [[cubic graph|trivalent]] distance-transitive graphs. These are:
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Graph name
! Vertex count
! [[Distance_(graph_theory)|Diameter]]
! [[Girth (graph theory)|Girth]]
! [[Intersection array]]
|-

|-
| [[complete bipartite graph]] K&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; || 6 || 2 || 4 || {3,2;1,3}

|-

|-
| [[Biggs-Smith graph]] || 102 || 7 || 9 || {3,2,2,2,1,1,1;1,1,1,1,1,1,3}
|-
| [[Foster graph]] || 90 || 8 || 10 || {3,2,2,2,2,1,1,1;1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3}
|}

== Relation to distance-regular graphs ==
Every distance-transitive graph is [[distance-regular graph|distance-regular]], but the converse is not necessarily true.

In 1969, before publication of the Biggs–Smith definition, a Russian group led by [[Georgy Adelson-Velsky]] showed that there exist graphs that are distance-regular but not distance-transitive. The only graph of this type with degree three is the 126-vertex [[Tutte 12-cage]]. The smallest distance-regular graph that is not distance-transitive is the [[Shrikhande graph]]. Complete lists of distance-transitive graphs are known for some degrees larger than three, but the classification of distance-transitive graphs with arbitrarily large vertex degree remains open.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2912">In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] mathematics, an '''Eulerian poset''' is a [[graded poset]] in which every nontrivial [[Partially ordered set#Interval|interval]] has the same number of elements of even rank as of odd rank. An Eulerian poset which is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] is an '''Eulerian lattice'''. These objects are named after [[Leonhard Euler]]. Eulerian lattices generalize [[face lattice]]s of [[convex polytope]]s and much recent research has been devoted to extending known results from [[polyhedral combinatorics]], such as various restrictions on ''f''-vectors of convex [[simplicial polytope]]s, to this more general setting.

== Examples ==

* The [[face lattice]] of a [[convex polytope]], consisting of its faces, together with the smallest element, the empty face, and the largest element, the polytope itself, is an Eulerian lattice. The odd–even condition follows from [[Euler characteristic|Euler's formula]].
* Any [[simplicial sphere|simplicial generalized homology sphere]] is an Eulerian lattice.
* Let ''L'' be a regular [[cell complex]] such that |''L''| is a [[manifold]] with the same Euler characteristic as the [[n-sphere|sphere]] of the same dimension (this condition is vacuous if the dimension is odd). Then the [[poset]] of cells of ''L'', ordered by the inclusion of their closures, is Eulerian.
* Let ''W'' be a [[Coxeter group]] with [[Bruhat order]]. Then (''W'',&amp;le;) is an Eulerian poset.

== Properties ==

* The defining condition of an Eulerian poset ''P'' can be equivalently stated in terms of its [[Incidence algebra|Möbius function]]:

:: &lt;math&gt; \mu_P(x,y)=(-1)^{|y|-|x|} \text{ for all } x\leq y.&lt;/math&gt;

* The dual of an Eulerian poset, obtained by reversing the partial order, is Eulerian.
* [[Richard P. Stanley|Richard Stanley]] defined the '''toric ''h''-vector''' of a [[ranked poset]], which generalizes the [[h-vector|''h''-vector]] of a simplicial polytope.&lt;ref&gt;''Enumerative combinatorics'', 3.14, p. 138; formerly called the ''generalized'' ''h''-vector''.&lt;/ref&gt; He proved that the [[Dehn–Sommerville equations]]

:: &lt;math&gt; h_k = h_{d-k} \, &lt;/math&gt;

: hold for an arbitrary Eulerian poset of rank ''d''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;''Enumerative combinatorics'', Theorem 3.14.9&lt;/ref&gt; However, for an Eulerian poset arising from a regular cell complex or a convex polytope, the toric ''h''-vector neither determines, nor is neither determined by the numbers of the cells or faces of different dimension and the toric ''h''-vector does not have a direct combinatorial interpretation.

In mathematics, an '''exposed point''' of a [[convex set]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a point &lt;math&gt;x\in C&lt;/math&gt; at which some [[continuous linear functional]] attains its strict [[maximum]] over &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Such a functional is then said to ''expose'' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Note that there can be many exposing functionals for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The set of exposed points of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is usually denoted &lt;math&gt;\exp(C)&lt;/math&gt;.

A stronger notion is that of ''strongly exposed point'' of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; which is an exposed point &lt;math&gt;x \in C&lt;/math&gt; such that some exposing functional &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; attains its strong [[maximum]] over &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. for each sequence &lt;math&gt;(x_n) \subset C&lt;/math&gt; we have the following implication: &lt;math&gt;f(x_n) \to \max f(C) \Longrightarrow \|x_n -x\| \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. The set of all strongly exposed points of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is usually denoted &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{str}\exp(C)&lt;/math&gt;.

There are two weaker notions, that of [[extreme point]] and that of [[support point]] of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[combinatorics]], the '''factorial number system''', also called '''factoradic''', is a [[mixed radix]] [[numeral system]] adapted to numbering [[permutation]]s.  It is also called '''factorial base''', although [[factorial]]s do not function as [[radix|base]], but as [[place value]] of digits. By converting a number less than ''n''! to factorial representation, one obtains a [[sequence]] of ''n'' digits that can be converted to a permutation of ''n'' in a straightforward way, either using them as [[Lehmer code]] or as [[inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion]] table&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Definition ==

The factorial number system is a [[mixed radix]] [[numeral system]]: the ''i''-th digit from the right has base&amp;nbsp;''i'', which means that the digit must be strictly less than ''i'', and that (taking into account the bases of the less significant digits) its value to be multiplied by {{math|(''i'' − 1)}}! (its place value).

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:right;"
|-
! {{rh}} | Radix                     
|    8  ||   7  ||   6 ||  5  ||  4 ||  3 ||  2 || 1
|-
! {{rh}} | Place value               
|   7!  ||  6!  ||  5! ||  4! || 3! || 2! || 1! || 0!
|-
! {{rh}} | Place value in decimal   
| 5040 || 720 || 120 || 24 || 6 ||  2 ||  1 || 1
|-
! {{rh}} | Highest digit allowed     
|    7  ||   6  ||   5 ||  4  ||  3 ||  2 ||  1 || 0
|}

From this it follows that the rightmost digit is always 0, the second can be 0 or 1, the third 0, 1 or 2, and so on {{OEIS|id=A124252}}. The factorial number system is sometimes defined with the 0! place omitted because it is always zero {{OEIS|id=A007623}}.

In this article, a factorial number representation will be flagged by a subscript "!", so for instance 341010&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt; stands for 3&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;4&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, whose value is

: {{=}} 3×5!&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4×4!&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1×3!&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0×2!&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1×1!&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0×0!&amp;nbsp;
: {{=}} ((((3×5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4)×4&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)×3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0)×2&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)×1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0
: {{=}} &amp;nbsp;463&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;.

(Note that the place value is one less than the radix position, which is why these equations begin with 5!.)

General properties of mixed radix number systems also apply to the factorial number system. For instance, one can convert a number into factorial representation producing digits from right to left, by repeatedly dividing the number by the radix (1, 2, 3, ...), taking the remainder as digits, and continuing with the [[integer]] quotient, until this [[quotient]] becomes 0.

For example, 463&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; can be transformed into a factorial representation by these successive divisions:
{| style="text-align:right;"
|
: 463 ÷ 1 = 463, remainder 0
: 463 ÷ 2 = 231, remainder 1
: 231 ÷ 3 = 77, remainder 0
: 77 ÷ 4 = 19, remainder 1
: 19 ÷ 5 = 3, remainder 4
: 3 ÷ 6 = 0, remainder 3
|}
The process terminates when the quotient reaches zero. Reading the remainders backward gives 341010&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt;.

In principle, this system may be extended to represent fractional numbers, though rather than the natural extension of place values (−1)!, (−2)!, etc., which are undefined, the symmetric choice of radix values n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. after the point may be used instead. Again, the 0 and 1 places may be omitted as these are always zero. The corresponding place values are therefore 1/1, 1/1, 1/2, 1/6, 1/24, ..., 1/n!, etc.

== Examples ==

The following sortable table shows the 24 permutations of four elements with different [[Inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion]] related vectors. The left and right inversion counts &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; (the latter often called [[Lehmer code]]) are particularly eligible to be interpreted as factorial numbers. &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; gives the permutation's position in reverse [[colexicographical order|colexicographic]] order (the default order of this table), and the latter the position in [[lexicographical order|lexicographic]] order (both counted from 0).

Sorting by a column that has the omissible 0 on the right makes the factorial numbers in that column correspond to the index numbers in the immovable column on the left. The small columns are reflections of the columns next to them, and can be used to bring those in colexicographic order. The rightmost column shows the digit sums of the factorial numbers ({{OEIS2C|A034968}} in the tables default order).

For another example, the greatest number that could be represented with six digits would be 543210&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt; which equals 719 in [[decimal]]:
:5×5! + 4×4! + 3x3! + 2×2! + 1×1! + 0×0!.

Clearly the next factorial number representation after 543210&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt; is 1000000&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt; which designates 6!&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;720&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, the place value for the radix-7 digit. So the former number, and its summed out expression above, is equal to:
:6! − 1.

The factorial number system provides a unique representation for each natural number, with the given restriction on the "digits" used. No number can be represented in more than one way because the sum of consecutive factorials multiplied by their index is always the next factorial minus one:
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^n {i\cdot i!} = {(n+1)!} - 1. &lt;/math&gt;

This can be easily proved with [[mathematical induction]], or simply by noticing that &lt;math&gt; \forall i, i.i!=(i+1-1).i!=(i+1)!-i! &lt;/math&gt; : subsequent terms cancel each other, leaving the first and last term (see [[Telescoping series]])

However, when using [[Arabic numeral]]s to write the digits (and not including the subscripts as in the above examples), their simple concatenation becomes ambiguous for numbers having a "digit" greater than 9. The smallest such example is the number 10&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10!&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;36288000&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, which may be written A0000000000&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt;, but not 100000000000&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt; which denotes 11! = 39916800&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus using letters A–Z to denote digits 10, 11, 12, ..., 35 as in other base-N make the largest representable number 36&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;36!&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. For arbitrarily greater numbers one has to choose a base for representing individual digits, say decimal, and provide a separating mark between them (for instance by subscripting each digit by its base, also given in decimal, like 2&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, this number also can be written as 2:0:1:0). In fact the factorial number system itself is not truly a [[numeral system]] in the sense of providing a representation for all natural numbers using only a finite alphabet of symbols.

== Permutations ==

There is a natural [[function (mathematics)|mapping]] between the [[integer]]s {{math|0,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''n''!&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} (or equivalently the numbers with ''n'' digits in factorial representation) and [[permutation]]s of ''n'' elements in [[lexicographical]] order, when the integers are expressed in factoradic form.  This mapping has been termed the [[Lehmer code]] (or inversion table). For example, with {{math|1=''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3}}, such a mapping is

{| class="wikitable"
!decimal
!factorial
!permutation
|-
|0&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
|000&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt;
|(0,1,2)
|-
|1&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
|010&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt;
|(0,2,1)
|-
|2&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
|100&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt;
|(1,0,2)
|-
|3&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
|110&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt;
|(1,2,0)
|-
|4&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
|200&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt;
|(2,0,1)
|-
|5&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;
|210&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt;
|(2,1,0)
|}

The leftmost factoradic digit 0, 1, or 2 is chosen as the first permutation digit from the ordered list (0,1,2) and is removed from the list. Think of this new list as zero indexed and each successive digit dictates which of the remaining elements is to be chosen. If the second factoradic digit is "0" then the first element of the list is selected for the second permutation digit and is then removed from the list. Similarly if the second factoradic digit is "1", the second is selected and then removed. The final factoradic digit is always "0", and since the list now contains only one element it is selected as the last permutation digit.

The process may become clearer with a longer example.  For example, here is how the digits in the factoradic 4041000&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt; (equal to 2982&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;) pick out the digits in (4,0,6,2,1,3,5), the 2982nd permutation of the numbers 0 through 6.
                                  4041000&lt;sub&gt;!&lt;/sub&gt; → (4,0,6,2,1,3,5)

== Fractional values ==

Unlike single radix systems whose place values are ''base''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; for both positive and negative integral n, the factorial number base cannot be extended to negative place values as these would be (−1)!, (−2)! and so on, and these values are undefined. (see [[factorial]])

One possible extension is therefore to use 1/0!, 1/1!, 1/2!, 1/3!, ..., 1/n! etc. instead, possibly omitting the 1/0! and 1/1! places which are always zero.

With this method, all rational numbers have a terminating expansion, whose length in 'digits' is less than or equal to the denominator of the rational number represented. This may be proven by considering that there exists a factorial for any integer and therefore the denominator divides into its own factorial even if it does not divide into any smaller factorial.

By necessity, therefore, the factoradic expansion of the reciprocal of a prime has a length of exactly that prime (less one if the 1/1! place is omitted). Other terms are given as the sequence [https://oeis.org/A046021 A046021] on the OEIS. It can also be proven that the last 'digit' or term of the representation of a rational with prime denominator is equal to the difference between the numerator and the prime denominator.

There is also a non-terminating equivalent for every rational number akin to the fact that in decimal 0.24999... = 0.25 = 1/4 and [[0.999...|0.999... = 1]], etc., which can be created by reducing the final term by 1 and then filling in the remaining infinite number of terms with the highest value possible for the radix of that position.

In the following selection of examples, spaces are used to separate the place values, otherwise represented in decimal. The rational numbers on the left are also in decimal:

* &lt;math&gt;1/2 = 0.0\ 1_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/3 = 0.0\ 0\ 2_!&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;2/11 = 0.0\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 4\ 6\ 2\ 8\ 1\ 9_!&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;10/11 = 0.0\ 1\ 2\ 1\ 4\ 0\ 3\ 6\ 4\ 9_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/12 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 2_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;5/12 = 0.0\ 0\ 2\ 2_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;7/12 = 0.0\ 1\ 0\ 2_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;11/12 = 0.0\ 1\ 2\ 2_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/15 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 3_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/16 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 2\ 3_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/18 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 1\ 4_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/20 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 1_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/24 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 1_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/30 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 4_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/36 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 3\ 2_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/60 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 2_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/72 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 4_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/120 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 1_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/144 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 5_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/240 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 3_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/360 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 2_!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;1/720 = 0.0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 1_!&lt;/math&gt;

There are also a small number of constants that have patterned representations with this method:

* &lt;math&gt;e = 1\ 0.0\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 1..._!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;e^{-1} = 0.0\ 0\ 2\ 0\ 4\ 0\ 6\ 0\ 8\ 0\ A\ 0\ C\ 0\ E..._!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\sin(1) = 0.0\ 1\ 2\ 0\ 0\ 5\ 6\ 0\ 0\ 9\ A\ 0\ 0\ D\ E..._!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\cos(1) = 0.0\ 1\ 0\ 0\ 4\ 5\ 0\ 0\ 8\ 9\ 0\ 0\ C\ D\ 0..._!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\sinh(1) = 1.0\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0..._!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\cosh(1) = 1.0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1..._!&lt;/math&gt;

In [[computational geometry]], the '''farthest-first traversal''' of a bounded [[metric space]] is a sequence of points in the space, where the first point is selected arbitrarily and each successive point is as far as possible from the set of previously-selected points. The same concept can also be applied to a [[finite set]] of geometric points, by restricting the selected points to belong to the set or equivalently by considering the finite metric space generated by these points. For a finite metric space or finite set of geometric points, the resulting sequence forms a [[permutation]] of the points, known as the '''greedy permutation'''.

Farthest-point traversals have many applications, including the approximation of the [[traveling salesman problem]] and the [[metric k-center|metric ''k''-center]] problem. They may be constructed in [[polynomial time]], or (for low-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]s) approximated in near-[[linear time]].

==Properties==
Fix a number ''k'', and consider the subset formed by the first ''k'' points of the farthest-first traversal of any metric space. Let ''r'' be the distance between the final point of the prefix and the set of previously-selected points. Then this subset has the following two properties:
*All pairs of the selected points are at distance at least ''r'' from each other, and
*All points of the whole metric space are at distance at most ''r'' from the subset.
In other words, each [[prefix]] of the farthest-first traversal forms a [[Delone set]].&lt;ref name="gonzalez"&gt;{{citation

==Applications==
The first use of the farthest-first traversal was by {{harvtxt|Rosenkrantz|Stearns|Lewis|1977}} in connection with [[heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] for the [[travelling salesman problem]]. In the farthest-insertion heuristic, discussed by Rosenkrantz et al., a tour is built up incrementally, by adding one point at a time in the ordering given by a farthest-first traversal. To add each point to the traveling salesman tour of the previous points, this heuristic considers all possible ways of breaking one edge of the tour and replacing it by two edges through the new point, and chooses the cheapest of these replacements. Although Rosenkrantz et al. prove only a logarithmic [[approximation ratio]] for this method, they show that in practice it often works better than other insertion methods with better provable approximation ratios.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Later, the same sequence of points was popularized by {{harvtxt|Gonzalez|1985}}, who used it as part of a [[greedy algorithm|greedy]] [[approximation algorithm]] for the problem of finding ''k'' clusters that minimize the maximum [[diameter]] of a cluster. The same algorithm applies also, with the same approximation quality, to the [[metric k-center|metric ''k''-center]] problem. This problem is one of several formulations of [[cluster analysis]] and [[facility location]], in which the goal is to partition a given set of points into ''k'' different clusters, each with a chosen center point, such that the maximum distance from any point to the center of its cluster is minimized. For instance, this problem can be used to model the placement of fire stations within a city, in order to ensure that every address within the city can be reached quickly by a fire truck. Gonzalez described a clustering heuristic that selects as centers the first ''k'' points of a farthest-first traversal, and then assigns each of the input points to its nearest center. If ''r'' is the distance from the set of ''k'' selected centers to the next point at position ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 in the traversal, then this
clustering achieves a distance of ''r''. However, the subset of ''k'' centers together with the next point are all at distance at least ''r'' from each other, and any ''k''-clustering would put two of these points into one cluster, so there is no clustering with distance better than ''r''/2. Thus, Gonzalez's heuristic gives an [[approximation ratio]] of&amp;nbsp;2 for this problem.&lt;ref name="gonzalez"/&gt; This heuristic, and the name "farthest-first traversal", are often incorrectly attributed to a different paper from the same time, {{harvtxt|Hochbaum|Shmoys|1985}}. However, Hochbaum and Shmoys used graph-theoretic techniques, not the farthest-first traversal, to obtain a different approximation algorithm for the metric ''k''-center with the same approximation ratio as Gonzalez's heuristic.&lt;ref name="hs85"&gt;{{citation

As well as for clustering, the farthest-first traversal can also be used in another type of facility location problem, the max-min facility dispersion problem, in which the goal is to choose the locations of ''k'' different facilities so that they are as far apart from each other as possible. More precisely, the goal in this problem is to choose ''k'' points from a given metric space or a given set of candidate points, in such a way as to maximize the minimum pairwise distance between the selected points. Again, this can be approximated by choosing the first ''k'' points of a farthest-first traversal. If ''r'' denotes the distance of the ''k''th point from all previous points, then every point of the metric space or the candidate set is within distance ''r'' of the first ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 points. By the [[pigeonhole principle]], some two points of the optimal solution (whatever it is) must both be within distance ''r'' of the same point among these first ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 chosen points, and (by the [[triangle inequality]]) within distance 2''r'' of each other. Therefore, the heuristic solution given by the farthest-first traversal is within a factor of two of optimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Algorithms==
The farthest-first traversal of a finite point set may be computed by a [[greedy algorithm]] that maintains the distance of each point from the previously selected points, performing the following steps:
*Initialize the sequence of selected points to the empty sequence, and the distances of each point to the selected points to infinity.
*While not all points have been selected, repeat the following steps:
**Scan the list of not-yet-selected points to find a point ''p'' that has the maximum distance from the selected points.
**Remove ''p'' from the not-yet-selected points and add it to the end of the sequence of selected points.
**For each remaining not-yet-selected point ''q'', replace the distance stored for ''q'' by the minimum of its old value and the distance from ''p'' to ''q''.
For a set of ''n'' points, this algorithm takes ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) steps and ''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) distance computations. A faster [[approximation algorithm]], given by {{harvtxt|Har-Peled|Mendel|2006}}, applies to any subset of points in a metric space with bounded [[doubling space|doubling dimension]], a class of spaces that include the [[Euclidean space]]s of bounded dimension. Their algorithm finds a sequence of points in which each successive point has distance within a 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;epsilon;'' factor of the farthest distance from the previously-selected point, where ''&amp;epsilon;'' can be chosen to be any positive number. It takes time ''O''(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For selecting points from a continuous space such as the [[Euclidean plane]], rather than a finite set of candidate points, these methods will not work directly, because there would be an infinite number of distances to maintain. Instead, each new point should be selected as the center of the [[largest empty sphere|largest empty circle]] defined by the previously-selected point set.&lt;ref name="elpz"/&gt; This center will always lie on a vertex of the [[Voronoi diagram]] of the already selected points, or at a point where an edge of the Voronoi diagram crosses the domain boundary. In this formulation the method for constructing farthest-first traversals has also been called '''incremental Voronoi insertion'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Inserting points uniformly at every instance|journal=IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems|volume=E89-D|issue=8|pages=2348–2356|first1=Sachio|last1=Teramoto|first2=Tetsuo|last2=Asano|author2-link=Tetsuo Asano|first3=Naoki|last3=Katoh|first4=Benjamin|last4=Doerr|url=http://search.ieice.org/bin/summary.php?id=e89-d_8_2348|doi=10.1093/ietisy/e89-d.8.2348|bibcode=2006IEITI..89.2348T}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to [[Ruppert's algorithm]] for [[Finite element method|finite element]] [[mesh generation]], but differs in the choice of which Voronoi vertex to insert at each step.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | doi=10.1006/jagm.1995.1021 | first=Jim | last=Ruppert |  title=A Delaunay refinement algorithm for quality 2-dimensional mesh generation | journal=Journal of Algorithms | year=1995 | issue=3 | pages= 548–585 | volume=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5410">In [[mathematical analysis]], the '''final value theorem''' (FVT) is one of several similar theorems used to relate [[frequency domain]] expressions to the [[time domain]] behavior as time approaches infinity. A final value theorem allows the time domain behavior to be directly calculated by taking a limit of a frequency domain expression, as opposed to converting to a time domain expression and taking its limit.

Mathematically, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bounded on &lt;math&gt;(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\to\infty}f(t)&lt;/math&gt;
has a finite limit, then
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\to\infty}f(t) = \lim_{s\to 0}{sF(s)}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the (unilateral) [[Laplace transform]] of &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="RWang2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e102/lectures/Laplace_Transform/node17.html |title=Initial and Final Value Theorems |first=Ruye |last=Wang |date=2010-02-17 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OppenheimWillskyNawab1997"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=0-13-814757-4 |title=Signals &amp;amp; Systems |author1=Alan V. Oppenheim |author2=Alan S. Willsky |author3=S. Hamid Nawab |location=New Jersey, USA |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, in discrete time
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{k\to\infty}f[k] = \lim_{z\to 1}{(z-1)F(z)}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the (unilateral) [[Z-transform]] of &lt;math&gt;f[k]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="OppenheimWillskyNawab1997"/&gt;

== Proofs ==
The first proof below has the virtue of being totally elementary and self-contained. If one is willing to use not-quite-so-elementary convergence theorems one can give a one-line proof using the [[Dominated Convergence Theorem]].

=== Elementary proof ===

Suppose for convenience that &lt;math&gt;|f(t)|\le1&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;(0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\lim_{t\to\infty}f(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;,
and choose &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;|f(t)-\alpha|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all
&lt;math&gt;t&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;s\int_0^\infty e^{-st}\,dt=1&lt;/math&gt;, for every
&lt;math&gt;s&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;sF(s)-\alpha=s\int_0^\infty(f(t)-\alpha)e^{-st}\,dt;&lt;/math&gt;
hence
:&lt;math&gt;|sF(s)-\alpha|\le s\int_0^A|f(t)-\alpha|e^{-st}\,dt+s\int_A^\infty
|f(t)-\alpha|e^{-st}\,dt
\le2s\int_0^Ae^{-st}\,dt+\epsilon s\int_A^\infty e^{-st}\,dt=I+II.&lt;/math&gt;

Now for every &lt;math&gt;s&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; we have 
:&lt;math&gt;II&lt;\epsilon s\int_0^\infty e^{-st}\,dt=\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
On the other hand, since &lt;math&gt;A&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; is fixed it is clear that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{s\to 0}I=0&lt;/math&gt;, and
so &lt;math&gt;|sF(s)-\alpha|&lt;2\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;s&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is small enough.

=== Proof using the dominated convergence theorem ===

Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\lim_{t\to\infty}f(t)&lt;/math&gt;.  A change of variable in the integral defining &lt;math&gt;F(s)&lt;/math&gt; shows that

:&lt;math&gt;sF(s)=\int_0^\infty f\left(\frac ts\right)e^{-t}\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bounded, there exists &lt;math&gt;M &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\left| f\left(\frac ts\right)e^{-t} \right| &lt;/math&gt;  is dominated by the integrable function &lt;math&gt;g(t):=M e^{-t}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, by the [[Dominated Convergence Theorem]], 

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{s\to0}sF(s)=\int_0^\infty\alpha e^{-t}\,dt=\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}

=== Example where FVT holds ===

For example, for a system described by [[transfer function]]
:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{ 6 }{s + 2},&lt;/math&gt;
and so the [[impulse response]] converges to
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t \to \infty} h(t) = \lim_{s \to 0} \frac{6s}{s+2} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
That is, the system returns to zero after being disturbed by a short impulse. However, the Laplace transform of the [[step response|unit step response]] is
:&lt;math&gt;G(s) = \frac{1}{s} \frac{6}{s+2}&lt;/math&gt;
and so the step response converges to
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t \to \infty} g(t) = \lim_{s \to 0} \frac{s}{s} \frac{6}{s+2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3&lt;/math&gt;
and so a zero-state system will follow an exponential rise to a final value of 3.

=== Example where FVT does not hold ===

For a system described by the transfer function

:&lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{9}{s^2 + 9},&lt;/math&gt;
the final value theorem ''appears'' to predict the final value of the impulse response to be 0 and the final value of the step response to be 1. However, neither time-domain limit exists, and so the final value theorem predictions are not valid. In fact, both the impulse response and step response oscillate, and (in this special case) the final value theorem describes the average values around which the responses oscillate.

There are two checks performed in [[Control theory]] which confirm valid results for the Final Value Theorem:
# All non-zero roots of the denominator of &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt; must have negative real parts.
# &lt;math&gt;H(s)&lt;/math&gt; must not have more than one pole at the origin.

Rule 1 was not satisfied in this example, in that the roots of the denominator are &lt;math&gt;0+j3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0-j3&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], a [[tuple|sequence]] of ''N'' [[real numbers|numbers]] can be understood to represent a [[coordinate system|location]] in an [[n-dimensional space|''N''-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space|space]]. Whether or not the [[universe]] is five-dimensional is a topic of debate.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Physics==
Much of the early work on five dimensional space was in an attempt to develop a [[Unified field theory|theory that unifies]] the four [[fundamental interactions]] in nature: [[Strong interaction|strong]] and [[weak interaction|weak]] nuclear forces, [[gravity]] and [[electromagnetism]]. [[Germany|German]] mathematician [[Theodor Kaluza]] and [[Sweden|Swedish]] physicist [[Oskar Klein]] independently developed the [[Kaluza–Klein theory]] in 1921, which used the fifth dimension to unify [[gravity]] with [[electromagnetic force]]. Although their approaches were later found to be at least partially inaccurate, the concept provided a basis for further research over the past century.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;

To explain why this dimension would not be directly observable, Klein suggested that the fifth dimension would be rolled up into a tiny, compact loop on the order of 10{{sup|-33}} centimeters.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; Under his reasoning, he envisioned light as a disturbance caused by rippling in the higher dimension just beyond human perception, similar to how fish in a pond can only see shadows of ripples across the surface of the water caused by raindrops.&lt;ref name="discovery"&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Holes on a String in the Fifth Dimension|first=Jennifer|last=Oulette|url=http://news.discovery.com/space/black-holes-on-a-string-in-the-fifth-dimension.htm|date=March 6, 2011|access-date=September 12, 2015|publisher=Discovery News}}&lt;/ref&gt; While not detectable, it would indirectly imply a connection between seemingly unrelated forces. Kaluza-Klein theory experienced a revival in the 1970s due to the emergence of [[string theory|superstring theory]] and [[supergravity]]: the concept that reality is composed of vibrating strands of energy, a postulate only mathematically viable in ten dimensions or more. Superstring theory then evolved into a more generalized approach known as [[M-theory]]. M-theory suggested a potentially observable extra dimension in addition to the ten essential dimensions which would allow for the existence of superstrings. The other 10 dimensions are compacted, or "rolled up", to a size below the subatomic level.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="discovery"/&gt; Kaluza–Klein theory today is seen as essentially a [[gauge theory]], with the [[gauge group|gauge]] being the [[circle group]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The fifth dimension is difficult to directly observe, though the [[Large Hadron Collider]] provides an opportunity to record indirect evidence of its existence.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; Physicists theorize that collisions of subatomic particles in turn produce new particles as a result of the collision, including a [[graviton]] that escapes from the fourth dimension, or [[brane]], leaking off into a five-dimensional bulk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physicists probe fifth dimension|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13070896/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/physicists-probe-fifth-dimension/|last=Boyle|first=Alan|publisher=NBC news|date=June 6, 2006|access-date=September 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; M-theory would explain the weakness of gravity relative to the other fundamental forces of nature, as can be seen, for example, when using a magnet to lift a pin off a table — the magnet is able to overcome the gravitational pull of the entire earth with ease.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt;

Mathematical approaches were developed in the early 20th century that viewed the fifth dimension as a theoretical construct. These theories make reference to [[Hilbert space]], a concept that postulates an infinite number of mathematical dimensions to allow for a limitless number of quantum states. [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Peter Bergmann|Bergmann]] and [[Valentine Bargmann|Bargmann]] later tried to extend the four-dimensional [[spacetime]] of [[theory of relativity|general relativity]] into an extra physical dimension to incorporate electromagnetism, though they were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="pbs"/&gt; In their 1938 paper, Einstein and Bergmann were among the first to introduce the modern viewpoint that a four-dimensional theory, which coincides with [[Einstein field equations#Einstein–Maxwell equations|Einstein-Maxwell theory]] at long distances, is derived from a five-dimensional theory with complete [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] in all five dimensions. They suggested that electromagnetism resulted from a gravitational field that is “polarized” in the fifth dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=Albert|last2=Bergmann|first2=Peter|title=On A Generalization Of Kaluza’s Theory Of Electricity|journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]]|volume= 39|date=1938|page=683|doi=10.2307/1968642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main novelty of Einstein and Bergmann was to seriously consider the fifth dimension as a physical entity, rather than an excuse to combine the [[metric tensor]] and electromagnetic potential. But they then reneged, modifying the theory to break its five-dimensional symmetry. Their reasoning, as suggested by [[Edward Witten]], was that the more symmetric version of the theory predicted the existence of a new long range field, one that was both [[Massless particle|massless]] and [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]], which would have required a fundamental modification to Einstein's [[theory of general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title=A Note On Einstein, Bergmann, and the Fifth Dimension|last=Witten|first=Edward|date=January 31, 2014|arxiv=1401.8048}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minkowski space]] and [[Maxwell's equations#In vacuum|Maxwell's equations in vacuum]] can be embedded in a five-dimensional [[Riemann curvature tensor]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
 
In 1993, the physicist [[Gerard 't Hooft]] put forward the [[holographic principle]], which explains that the ''information about an extra dimension is visible as a curvature in a spacetime with one fewer dimension''.  For example, holograms are three-dimensional pictures placed on a two-dimensional surface, which gives the image a curvature when the observer moves.  Similarly, in general relativity, the fourth dimension is manifested in observable three dimensions as the curvature path of a moving infinitesimal (test) particle.  'T Hooft has speculated that the fifth dimension is really the ''spacetime fabric''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Five-dimensional geometry==
According to Klein’s definition, "a geometry is the study of the invariant properties of a spacetime, under transformations within itself." Therefore, the geometry of the 5th dimension studies the invariant properties of such space-time, as we move within it, expressed in formal equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sancho|first= Luis|date=October 4, 2011|title=Absolute Relativity: The 5th dimension (abridged)|page=442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polytopes===

{{Main article|5-polytope}}

In five or more dimensions, only three [[regular polytope]]s exist.  In five dimensions, they are:

# The '''[[5-simplex]]''' of the [[simplex]] family, {3,3,3,3}, with 6 vertices, 15 edges, 20 faces (each an [[equilateral triangle]]), 15 cells (each a regular [[tetrahedron]]), and 6 hypercells (each a [[5-cell]]).
# The '''[[5-cube]]''' of the [[hypercube]] family, {4,3,3,3}, with 32 vertices, 80 edges, 80 faces (each a [[Square (geometry)|square]]), 40 cells (each a [[cube]]), and 10 hypercells (each a [[tesseract]]).
# The '''[[5-orthoplex]]''' of the [[cross polytope]] family, {3,3,3,4}, with 10 vertices, 40 edges, 80 faces (each a [[triangle]]), 80 cells (each a [[tetrahedron]]), and 32 hypercells (each a [[5-cell]]).

An important uniform 5-polytope is the [[5-demicube]], h{4,3,3,3} has half the vertices of the 5-cube (16), bounded by alternating [[5-cell]] and [[16-cell]] hypercells. The [[Expansion (geometry)|expanded]] or [[stericated 5-simplex]] is the vertex figure of the [[A5 lattice|A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; lattice]], {{CDD|node_1|split1|nodes|3ab|nodes|split2|node}}. It and has a doubled symmetry from its symmetric Coxeter diagram. The kissing number of the lattice, 30, is represented in its vertices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Gabriele.Nebe/LATTICES/A5.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[rectified 5-orthoplex]] is the vertex figure of the  [[D5 lattice|D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; lattice]], {{CDD|nodes_10ru|split2|node|3|node|split1|nodes}}. Its 40 vertices represent the [[kissing number]] of the lattice and the highest for dimension 5.&lt;ref&gt;''Sphere packings, lattices, and groups'', by [[John Horton Conway]], Neil James Alexander Sloane, Eiichi Bannai

=== Hypersphere ===
A [[hypersphere]] in 5-space (also called a '''4-sphere''' due to its surface being 4-dimensional) consists of the set of all points in 5-space at a fixed distance ''r'' from a central point P. The hypervolume enclosed by this hypersurface is:
:&lt;math&gt;V=\frac{8\pi ^2r^5}{15}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[quantum computing]], and more specifically in [[superconducting quantum computing]], '''flux qubits''' (also known as '''persistent current qubits''') are micrometer sized loops of superconducting metal interrupted by a number of [[Josephson junction]]s, functioning as [[qubit|quantum bits]]. The junction parameters are engineered during fabrication so that a persistent current will flow continuously when an external magnetic flux is applied. As only an integer number of [[flux quanta]] are allowed to penetrate the superconducting ring, clockwise or counter-clockwise currents are developed in the loop to compensate (screen or enhance) a non-integer external flux bias. When the applied flux through the loop area is close to a half integer number of flux quanta, the two lowest energy [[eigenstate]]s of the loop will be a [[quantum superposition]] of the clockwise and counter-clockwise currents. The two lowest energy eigenstates differ only by the relative quantum phase between the composing current-direction states. Higher energy eigenstates correspond to much larger persistent currents, that induce an additional flux quantum to the qubit loop, thus are well separated energetically from the lowest two eigenstates. This separation, known as the "qubit non linearity" criteria,  allows operations with the two lowest eigenstates only,  effectively creating a [[two level system]]. Usually, the two lowest eigenstates will serve as the computational basis for the [[logical qubit]].

[[Image:Flux Qubit - Holloway.jpg|thumb|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] image of a 4-junction flux qubit fabricated at Royal Holloway University of London.]]

Computational operations are performed by pulsing the qubit with [[microwave]] frequency radiation which has an energy comparable to that of the gap between the energy of the two basis states. Properly selected pulse duration can put the qubit into a [[quantum superposition]] of the two basis states while subsequent pulses can manipulate the probability weighting that the qubit will be measured in either of the two basis states, thus performing a computational operation.

== Fabrication ==

Flux qubits are fabricated using techniques similar to those used for [[microelectronics]]. The devices are usually made on silicon or sapphire wafers using [[electron beam lithography]] and metallic thin film evaporation processes. To create [[Josephson junction]]s, a technique known as [[Niemeyer–Dolan technique|shadow evaporation]] is normally used; this involves evaporating the source metal  alternately at two angles through the lithography defined mask in the electron beam resist. This results in two overlapping layers of the superconducting metal, in between which a thin layer of insulator (normally [[aluminum oxide]]) is deposited.

== Flux qubit parameters ==
The flux qubit is distinguished from other types of superconducting qubit such as the [[charge qubit]] or [[phase qubit]] by the coupling energy and charging energy of its junctions. In the charge qubit regime the charging energy of the junctions dominates the coupling energy, while in a flux qubit the situation is reversed and the coupling energy dominates. Typically in a flux qubit the coupling energy is 10-100 times greater than the charging energy. It is this ratio that allows the Cooper pairs to flow continuously around the loop, rather than tunnel discretely across the junctions as in a charge qubit.

== Coupling ==
Coupling between two or more qubits is essential to implement many-qubit [[quantum gate|gates]]. The two basic coupling mechanisms are the direct inductive coupling and coupling via a microwave resonator. In the direct coupling, the circulating currents of the qubits inductively affect one another - clockwise current in one qubit induces counter-clockwise current in the other. In the [[Pauli Matrices]] formalism, a {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''σ''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} term appears in the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], essential for the [[controlled NOT gate]] implementation.&lt;ref name="NielsenChuang"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nielsen, Michael A.  |author2=Chuang, Isaac L.|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information | publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-63235-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The direct coupling might be further enhanced by [[kinetic inductance]], if the qubit loops are made to share an edge, so that the currents will flow through the same superconducting line. Inserting a [[Josephson junction]] on that joint line will add a Josephson inductance term, and increase the coupling even more. To implement a switchable coupling in the direct coupling mechanism, as required to implement a gate of finite duration, an intermediate coupling loop may be used. The control magnetic flux applied to the coupler loop switches the coupling on and off, as implemented, for example, in the [[D-Wave Systems]] machines. The second method of coupling utilizes an intermediate [[microwave cavity]] resonator, commonly implemented in a [[coplanar waveguide]] geometry. By tuning the energy separation of the qubits to match the one of the resonator, the phases of the loop currents are synchronized, and a {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''σ''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}} coupling is implemented. Tuning the qubits in and out of resonance (for example, by modifying their bias magnetic flux) controls the duration of the gate operation.

== Readout ==
Like all quantum bits, flux qubits require a suitably sensitive probe coupled to it in order to measure its state after a computation has been carried out. Such quantum probes should introduce as little back-action as possible onto the qubit during measurement. Ideally they should be decoupled during computation and then turned "on" for a short time during read-out. Read-out probes for flux qubits work by interacting with one of the qubit's macroscopic variables, such as the circulating current, the flux within the loop or the macroscopic phase of the superconductor. This interaction then changes some variable of the read-out probe which can be measured using conventional low-noise electronics. The read-out probe is typically the technology aspect that separates the research of different University groups working on flux qubits.

Prof. Mooij's group at Delft in the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://qt.tn.tudelft.nl/research/fluxqubit/ University of Delft - Flux Qubit Website] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080301104624/http://qt.tn.tudelft.nl/research/fluxqubit/ |date=2008-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with collaborators, has pioneered flux qubit technology, and were the first to conceive, propose and implement flux qubits as they are known today. The Delft read-out scheme is based on a [[SQUID]] loop that is inductively coupled to the qubit, the qubit's state influences the critical current of the SQUID. The critical current can then be read-out using ramped measurement currents through the SQUID. Recently the group has used the plasma frequency of the SQUID as the read-out variable.

Dr. Il'ichev's group at [[IPHT Jena]] in Germany&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipht-jena.de/BEREICH_1/abt13_cryo_electronics/application-data/computing.php University of Jena - Flux Qubit Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214111933/http://www.ipht-jena.de/BEREICH_1/abt13_cryo_electronics/application-data/computing.php |date=February 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are using impedance measurement techniques based on the flux qubit influencing the resonant properties of a high quality tank circuit, which, like the Delft group is also inductively coupled to the qubit. In this scheme the qubit's magnetic susceptibility, which is defined by its state, changes the phase angle between the current and voltage when a small A.C. signal is passed into the tank circuit.

Recently Prof. Petrashov's group at Royal Holloway &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhul.ac.uk/physics/research/postgraduateopportunities/nanophysicsnanotechnology/superconductorfluxqubits.aspx Royal Holloway University of London - Flux Qubit Website ]&lt;/ref&gt; are using an [[Andreev interferometer]] probe to read out flux qubits. This read-out uses the phase influence of a superconductor on the conductance properties of a normal metal. A length of normal metal is connected at either end to either side of the qubit using superconducting leads, the phase across the qubit, which is defined by its state, is translated into the normal metal, the resistance of which is then read-out using low noise resistance measurements.

In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[fractal geometry]], a '''fractal dimension''' is a ratio providing a statistical index of [[complexity]] comparing how detail in a [[pattern]] (strictly speaking, a [[fractal]] pattern) changes with the [[Scaling (geometry)|scale]] at which it is measured. It has also been characterized as a measure of the [[Space-filling curve|space-filling]] capacity of a pattern that tells how a fractal scales differently from the [[space]] it is embedded in; a fractal dimension does not have to be an integer.&lt;ref name="Falconer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="space filling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vicsek"&gt;{{cite book | last = Vicsek | first = Tamás | title = Fractal growth phenomena | publisher = World Scientific | location = Singapore New Jersey | year = 1992 | isbn = 978-981-02-0668-0 | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essential idea of "fractured" [[Hausdorff dimension|dimensions]] has a long history in mathematics, but the term itself was brought to the fore by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] based on [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|his 1967 paper]] on [[self-similarity]] in which he discussed ''fractional dimensions''.&lt;ref name="coastline"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mandelbrot | first1 = B. | title = How Long is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension | doi = 10.1126/science.156.3775.636 | journal = Science | volume = 156 | issue = 3775 | pages = 636–638 | year = 1967 | pmid =  17837158| pmc = |bibcode = 1967Sci...156..636M }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that paper, Mandelbrot cited previous work by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] describing the counter-intuitive notion that a coastline's measured length changes with the length of the measuring stick used ([[#coastline|see Fig. 1]]). In terms of that notion, the fractal dimension of a coastline quantifies how the number of scaled measuring sticks required to measure the coastline changes with the scale applied to the stick.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983"/&gt; There are several formal [[#specific definitions|mathematical definitions]] of fractal dimension that build on this basic concept of change in detail with change in scale.

Ultimately, the term ''fractal dimension'' became the phrase that Mandelbrot himself became most comfortable with respect to encapsulating the meaning of the word ''fractal'', a term he created.  After several iterations over years, Mandelbrot settled on this use of the language:  "...to use ''fractal'' without a pedantic definition, to use ''fractal dimension'' as a generic term applicable to ''all'' the variants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dk2vruTv0_gC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=%22A+fractal+is+by+definition+a+set+for+which+the+Hausdorff-Besicovitch+dimension+strictly+exceeds+the+topological+dimension.%22+mandelbrot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oB0FEw1ogb&amp;sig=1PH4h_RSGdrKuQfgdFLD9CULAUY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOm9XHvsXWAhXGyyYKHRPlAVAQ6AEIUjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A+fractal+is+by+definition+a+set+for+which+the+Hausdorff-Besicovitch+dimension+strictly+exceeds+the+topological+dimension.%22+mandelbrot&amp;f=false|title=Measure, Topology, and Fractal Geometry|first=Gerald|last=Edgar|date=23 October 2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One non-trivial example is the fractal dimension of a [[Koch snowflake]]. It has a [[topological dimension]] of 1, but it is by no means a [[rectifiable curve]]: the [[arc length|length of the curve]] between any two points on the Koch snowflake is [[Arc length#Curves with infinite length|infinite]]. No small piece of it is line-like, but rather it is composed of an infinite number of segments joined at different angles. The fractal dimension of a curve can be explained intuitively thinking of a fractal line as an object too detailed to be one-dimensional, but too simple to be two-dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Harte | first = David | title = Multifractals | publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall | location = London | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-1-58488-154-4 |pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore its dimension might best be described not by its usual topological dimension of 1 but by its fractal dimension, which is often a number between one and two; in the case of the Koch snowflake, it is about 1.262.

''Fractal dimensions'' were first applied as an index characterizing complicated geometric forms for which the details seemed more important than the gross picture.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot quote"/&gt; For sets describing ordinary geometric shapes, the theoretical fractal dimension equals the set's familiar [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] or [[topological dimension]]. Thus, it is 0 for sets describing points (0-dimensional sets); 1 for sets describing lines (1-dimensional sets having length only); 2 for sets describing surfaces (2-dimensional sets having length and width); and 3 for sets describing volumes (3-dimensional sets having length, width, and height). But this changes for fractal sets. If the theoretical fractal dimension of a set exceeds its topological dimension, the set is considered to have fractal geometry.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot Chaos"/&gt;

Unlike topological dimensions, the fractal index can take non-[[integer]] values,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sharifi-Viand | first1 = A. | last2 = Mahjani | first2 = M.

Similarly, a surface with fractal dimension of 2.1 fills space very much like an ordinary surface, but one with a fractal dimension of 2.9 folds and flows to fill space rather nearly like a volume.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot Chaos"/&gt;{{rp|48}}&lt;ref group=notes&gt;See [[List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension|a graphic representation of different fractal dimensions]]&lt;/ref&gt; This general relationship can be seen in the two images of fractal curves in [[#32seg|Fig.2]] and [[#kline|Fig. 3]] – the 32-segment contour in Fig. 2, convoluted and space filling, has a fractal dimension of 1.67, compared to the perceptibly less complex Koch curve in Fig. 3, which has a fractal dimension of 1.26.

{{anchor|kline}}
[[Image:blueklineani2.gif|right|thumb|alt=a Koch curve animation|''Figure 3.'' The [[Koch curve]] is a classic [[iteration|iterated]] fractal curve. It is a theoretical construct that is made by iteratively scaling a starting segment. As shown, each new segment is scaled by 1/3 into 4 new pieces laid end to end with 2 middle pieces leaning toward each other between the other two pieces, so that if they were a triangle its base would be the length of the middle piece, so that the whole new segment fits across the traditionally measured length between the endpoints of the previous segment. Whereas the animation only shows a few iterations, the theoretical curve is scaled in this way infinitely. Beyond about 6 iterations on an image this small, the detail is lost.]]

The relationship of an increasing fractal dimension with space-filling might be taken to mean fractal dimensions measure density, but that is not so; the two are not strictly correlated.&lt;ref name="empirical fractal dimension"/&gt; Instead, a fractal dimension measures complexity, a concept related to certain key features of fractals: [[self-similarity]] and [[Fractal#characteristics|detail or irregularity]].&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;[[Fractal#characteristics|See Fractal characteristics]]&lt;/ref&gt; These features are evident in the two examples of fractal curves. Both are curves with [[topological dimension]] of 1, so one might hope to be able to measure their length or [[slope]], as with ordinary lines. But we cannot do either of these things, because fractal curves have complexity in the form of self-similarity and detail that ordinary lines lack.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983"/&gt; The ''self-similarity'' lies in the infinite scaling, and the ''detail'' in the defining elements of each set. The [[arc length|length]] between any two points on these curves is [[Arc length#Curves with infinite length|undefined]] because the curves are theoretical constructs that never stop repeating themselves.&lt;ref name="von Koch paper"&gt;Helge von Koch, "On a continuous curve without tangents constructible from elementary geometry" In {{cite book

| pages=25–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every smaller piece is composed of an infinite number of scaled segments that look exactly like the first iteration. These are not [[rectifiable curve]]s, meaning they cannot be measured by being broken down into many segments approximating their respective lengths. They cannot be characterized by finding their lengths or slopes. However, their fractal dimensions can be determined, which shows that both fill space more than ordinary lines but less than surfaces, and allows them to be compared in this regard.

Note that the two fractal curves described above show a type of self-similarity that is exact with a repeating unit of detail that is readily visualized. This sort of structure can be extended to other spaces (e.g., a [[List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension|fractal]] that extends the Koch curve into 3-d space has a theoretical D=2.5849). However, such neatly countable complexity is only one example of the self-similarity and detail that are present in fractals.&lt;ref name="vicsek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="time series"/&gt; The example of the coast line of Britain, for instance, exhibits self-similarity of an approximate pattern with approximate scaling.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983"/&gt;{{rp|26}} Overall, [[fractal]]s show several [[Fractal#characteristics|types and degrees of self-similarity]] and detail that may not be easily visualized.

== History ==
The terms ''fractal dimension'' and ''fractal'' were coined by Mandelbrot in 1975,&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot quote"/&gt; about a decade after he published his paper on self-similarity in the coastline of Britain. Various historical authorities credit him with also synthesizing centuries of complicated theoretical mathematics and engineering work and applying them in a new way to study complex geometries that defied description in usual linear terms.&lt;ref name="classics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacTutor"/&gt; The earliest roots of what Mandelbrot synthesized as the fractal dimension have been traced clearly back to writings about undifferentiable, infinitely self-similar functions, which are important in the mathematical definition of fractals, around the time that [[calculus]] was discovered in the mid-1600s.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983" /&gt;{{rp|405}} There was a lull in the published work on such functions for a time after that, then a renewal starting in the late 1800s with the publishing of mathematical functions and sets that are today called canonical fractals (such as the eponymous works of [[Helge von Koch|von Koch]],&lt;ref name="von Koch paper"/&gt; [[Sierpiński]], and [[Gaston Julia|Julia]]), but at the time of their formulation were often considered antithetical mathematical "monsters".&lt;ref name="classics"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; These works were accompanied by perhaps the most pivotal point in the development of the concept of a fractal dimension through the work of [[Felix Hausdorff|Hausdorff]] in the early 1900s who defined a "fractional" [[Hausdorff dimension|dimension]] that has come to be named after him and is frequently invoked in defining modern [[fractals]].&lt;ref name="coastline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983"/&gt;{{rp|44}}&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot Chaos"&gt;

== Role of scaling ==
{{anchor|unity}}
[[Image:Fractaldimensionexample.PNG|right|thumb|width=300px|alt=Lines, squares, and cubes.|''Figure 4.'' Traditional notions of geometry for defining scaling and dimension.]]

The concept of a fractal dimension rests in unconventional views of scaling and dimension.&lt;ref name = fil&gt;{{cite book|author=Iannaccone, Khokha|year=1996|title=Fractal Geometry in Biological Systems|isbn=978-0-8493-7636-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[#unity|Fig. 4]] illustrates, traditional notions of geometry dictate that shapes scale predictably according to intuitive and familiar ideas about the space they are contained within, such that, for instance, measuring a line using first one measuring stick then another 1/3 its size, will give for the second stick a total length 3 times as many sticks long as with the first. This holds in 2 dimensions, as well. If one measures the area of a square then measures again with a box of side length 1/3 the size of the original, one will find 9 times as many squares as with the first measure. Such familiar scaling relationships can be defined mathematically by the general scaling rule in Equation 1, where the variable &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; stands for the number of sticks, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for the scaling factor, and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; for the fractal dimension:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{{N \propto \epsilon^{-D}}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

The symbol &lt;math&gt;\propto&lt;/math&gt; above denotes [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality]]. This scaling rule typifies conventional rules about geometry and dimension – for lines, it quantifies that, because &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;=3 when &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;=1/3 as in the example above, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;=1, and for squares, because &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;=9 when &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;=1/3, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;=2.

{{anchor|koch}}
[[Image:KochFlake.svg|width=300|right|thumb|alt=A fractal contour of a koch snowflake|''Figure 5.'' The first four [[iteration]]s of the [[Koch snowflake]], which has an approximate [[Hausdorff dimension]] of 1.2619.]]

The same rule applies to fractal geometry but less intuitively. To elaborate, a fractal line measured at first to be one length, when remeasured using a new stick scaled by 1/3 of the old may not be the expected 3 but instead 4 times as many scaled sticks long. In this case, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;=4 when &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;=1/3, and the value of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; can be found by rearranging Equation 1:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{{\log_{\epsilon}{N}={-D}=\frac{\log{N}}{\log{\epsilon}}}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}

That is, for a fractal described by &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;=4 when &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;=1/3, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;=1.2619, a non-integer dimension that suggests the fractal has a dimension not equal to the space it resides in.&lt;ref name="vicsek" /&gt; The scaling used in this example is the same scaling of the [[#kline|Koch curve]] and [[#koch|snowflake]]. Of note, the images shown are not true fractals because the scaling described by the value of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; cannot continue infinitely for the simple reason that the images only exist to the point of their smallest component, a pixel. The theoretical pattern that the digital images represent, however, has no discrete pixel-like pieces, but rather is composed of an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of infinitely scaled segments joined at different angles and does indeed have a fractal dimension of 1.2619.&lt;ref name="Mandelbrot1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fil/&gt;

Two [[L-systems]] branching fractals that are made by producing 4 new parts for every 1/3 [[self similarity|scaling]] so have the same theoretical &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; as the Koch curve and for which the empirical [[box counting]] &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; has been demonstrated with 2% accuracy.&lt;ref name="empirical fractal dimension"/&gt;]]

As is the case with dimensions determined for lines, squares, and cubes, fractal dimensions are general descriptors that do not uniquely define patterns.&lt;ref name="fil"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vicsek&gt;{{cite book |author=Vicsek, Tamás |title=Fluctuations and scaling in biology |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2001 |isbn=0-19-850790-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of ''D'' for the Koch fractal discussed above, for instance, quantifies the pattern's inherent scaling, but does not uniquely describe nor provide enough information to reconstruct it. Many fractal structures or patterns could be constructed that have the same scaling relationship but are dramatically different from the Koch curve, as is illustrated in [[#statistical koch like scaling image|Figure 6]].

{{anchor|specific definitions}}

== Examples ==
The concept of fractal dimension described in this article is a basic view of a complicated construct. The examples discussed here were chosen for clarity, and the scaling unit and ratios were known ahead of time. In practice, however, fractal dimensions can be determined using techniques that approximate scaling and detail from [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]]s estimated from [[regression line]]s over [[logarithm|log vs log]] plots of size vs scale. Several formal mathematical definitions of different types of fractal dimension are listed below. Although for some classic fractals all these dimensions coincide, in general they are not equivalent:
* [[box-counting dimension|Box counting dimension]]: ''D'' is [[box counting|estimated]] as the exponent of a [[power law#Estimating the exponent from empirical data|power law]].
:&lt;math&gt;D_0 = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{\log N(\epsilon)}{\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}}.&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Information dimension]]: ''D'' considers how the average [[information entropy|information]] needed to identify an occupied box scales with box size; &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a probability.
:&lt;math&gt;D_1 = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{-\langle \log p_\epsilon \rangle}{\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}}&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Correlation dimension]] ''D'' is based on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; as the number of points used to generate a representation of a fractal and ''g''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;, the number of pairs of points closer than ε to each other.
:&lt;math&gt;D_2 = \lim_{M \rightarrow \infty} \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{\log (g_\epsilon / M^2)}{\log \epsilon}&lt;/math&gt; {{Citation needed|reason=Limit was incorrect, not sure if correction is|date=June 2017}}
* Generalized or Rényi dimensions
:The box-counting, information, and correlation dimensions can be seen as special cases of a continuous spectrum of [[Rényi entropy|generalized dimensions]] of order α, defined by:
:&lt;math&gt;D_\alpha = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{\frac{1}{\alpha-1}\log(\sum_{i} p_i^\alpha)}{\log\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Higuchi dimension]]&lt;ref&gt;http://tswww.ism.ac.jp/higuchi/index_e/papers/PhysicaD-1988.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{d\ \log(L(k))}{d\ \log(k)}&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Multifractal]] dimensions: a special case of Rényi dimensions where scaling behaviour varies in different parts of the pattern.
* [[Uncertainty exponent]]
* [[Hausdorff dimension]]
* [[Packing dimension]]
* [[Assouad dimension]]
* [[Local connected dimension]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jelinek | first1 = A. | doi = 10.2147/OPTH.S1579 | last2 = Jelinek | first2 = H. F. | last3 = Leandro | first3 = J.

== Estimating from real-world data ==
Many real-world phenomena exhibit limited or statistical fractal properties and fractal dimensions that have been estimated from [[Sample (statistics)|sampled]] data using computer based [[fractal analysis]] techniques.  
Practically, measurements of fractal dimension are affected by various methodological issues, and are sensitive to numerical or experimental noise and limitations in the amount of data. Nonetheless, the field is rapidly growing as estimated fractal dimensions for statistically self-similar phenomena may have many practical applications in various fields including

An alternative to a direct measurement, is considering a mathematical model that resembles formation of a real-world fractal object. In this case, a validation can also be done by comparing other than fractal properties implied by the model, with measured data. In [[colloid|colloidal physics]], systems composed of particles with various fractal dimensions arise. To describe these systems, it is convenient  to speak about a [[Probability distribution|distribution]] of fractal dimensions, and eventually, a time evolution of the latter: a process that is driven by a complex interplay between [[Particle aggregation|aggregation]] and [[Coalescence (chemistry)|coalescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/mats.201300140| title = Population Balance Modeling of Aggregation and Coalescence in Colloidal Systems| journal = Macromolecular Theory and Simulations| volume = 23| issue = 3| pages = 170–181| year = 2014| last1 = Kryven | first1 = I. | last2 = Lazzari | first2 = S. | last3 = Storti | first3 = G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[analytical mechanics]], specifically the study of the [[rigid body dynamics]] of [[multibody system]]s, the term '''generalized coordinates''' refers to the parameters that describe the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the [[physical system|system]] relative to some reference configuration.   These parameters must uniquely define the configuration of the system relative to the reference configuration.&lt;ref name=Ginsberg&gt;{{harvnb |Ginsberg |2008 }}, 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=je0W8N5oXd4C&amp;pg=PA397 p. 397, &amp;nbsp;§7.2.1 Selection of generalized coordinates]&lt;/ref&gt; This is done assuming that this can be done with a single [[Manifold#Atlases|chart]]. The '''generalized velocities''' are the time [[derivative]]s of the generalized coordinates of the system.

An example of a generalized coordinate is the angle that locates a point moving on a circle. The adjective "generalized" distinguishes these parameters from the traditional use of the term coordinate to refer to [[Cartesian coordinates]]: for example, describing the location of the point on the circle using x and y coordinates.

Although there may be many choices for generalized coordinates for a physical system, parameters which are convenient are usually selected for the specification of the configuration of the system and which make the solution of its [[equations of motion]] easier. If these parameters are independent of one another, the number of independent generalized coordinates is defined by the number of [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] of the system.&lt;ref name=Amirouche&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of multibody dynamics: theory and applications |author=Farid M.

Generalized coordinates are usually selected to provide the minimum number of independent coordinates that define the configuration of a system, which simplifies the formulation of [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]] of motion.  However, it can also occur that a useful set of generalized coordinates may be ''dependent'', which means that they are related by one or more [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]] equations.

===Holonomic constraints===

|footer=Two generalized coordinates, two degrees of freedom, on curved surfaces in 3d.

The full three [[Cartesian coordinates]] (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') are not necessary because any two determines the third according to the equations of the curves.}}

For a system of ''N'' particles in 3D [[real coordinate space]], the [[position vector]] of each particle can be written as a 3-[[tuple]] in [[Cartesian coordinates]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1 = (x_1,y_1,z_1) \,, \quad \mathbf{r}_2 = (x_2,y_2,z_2) \,, \ldots \,, \mathbf{r}_N = (x_N,y_N,z_N)\,. &lt;/math&gt;

Any of the position vectors can be denoted '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''k'' = 1, 2, ..., ''N'' labels the particles. A ''[[holonomic constraint]]'' is a ''constraint equation'' of the form for particle ''k''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = nb&gt;Some authors set the constraint equations to a constant for convenience with some constraint equations (e.g. pendulums), others set it to zero. It makes no difference because the constant can be subtracted to give zero on one side of the equation. Also, in Lagrange's equations of the first kind, only the derivatives are needed.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{r}_k, t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

which connects all the 3 spatial coordinates of that particle together, so they are not independent. The constraint may change with time, so time ''t'' will appear explicitly in the constraint equations. At any instant of time, any one coordinate will be determined from the other coordinates, e.g. if ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''z&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are given, then so is ''y&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. One constraint equation counts as ''one'' constraint. If there are ''C'' constraints, each has an equation, so there will be ''C'' constraint equations. There is not necessarily one constraint equation for each particle, and if there are no constraints on the system then there are no constraint equations.

So far, the configuration of the system is defined by 3''N'' quantities, but ''C'' coordinates can be eliminated, one coordinate from each constraint equation. The number of independent coordinates is ''n'' = 3''N'' − ''C''. (In ''D'' dimensions, the original configuration would need ''ND'' coordinates, and the reduction by constraints means ''n'' = ''ND'' − ''C''). It is ideal to use the minimum number of coordinates needed to define the configuration of the entire system, while taking advantage of the constraints on the system. These quantities are known as '''generalized coordinates''' in this context, denoted ''q&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''(''t''). It is convenient to collect them into an ''n''-[[tuple]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q}(t) = (q_1(t), q_2(t), \ldots, q_n(t)) &lt;/math&gt;

which is a point in the ''[[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]]'' of the system. They are all independent of one other, and each is a function of time. Geometrically they can be lengths along straight lines, or [[arc length]]s along curves, or angles; not necessarily Cartesian coordinates or other standard [[orthogonal coordinates]]. There is one for each [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]], so the number of generalized coordinates equals the number of degrees of freedom, ''n''. A degree of freedom corresponds to one quantity that changes the configuration of the system, for example the angle of a pendulum, or the arc length traversed by a bead along a wire.

If it is possible to find from the constraints as many independent variables as there are degrees of freedom, these can be used as generalized coordinates&lt;ref name="Kibble 2004 page=232"&gt;{{harvnb|Kibble |Berkshire|edition=5th|2004|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position vector '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of particle ''k'' is a function of all the ''n'' generalized coordinates (and, through them, of time),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torby|1984|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hand 2008 page=15"&gt;{{harvnb|Hand|Finch|2008|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kibble 2004 page=232"/&gt;&lt;ref group = nb&gt;Some authors e.g. Hand &amp; Finch take the form of the position vector for particle ''k'', as shown here, as the condition for the constraint on that particle to be holonomic.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_k = \mathbf{r}_k(\mathbf{q}(t)) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

and the generalized coordinates can be thought of as parameters associated with the constraint.

The corresponding time derivatives of '''q''' are the [[Generalized coordinates#Generalized velocities and kinetic energy|generalized velocities]],

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{q}} = \frac{d\mathbf{q}}{dt} = (\dot{q}_1(t), \dot{q}_2(t), \ldots, \dot{q}_n(t)) &lt;/math&gt;

(each dot over a quantity indicates one [[time derivative]]). The velocity vector '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[total derivative]] of '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to time

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_k = \dot{\mathbf{r}}_k = \frac{d\mathbf{r}_k}{dt} = \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_k}{\partial q_j}\dot{q}_j \,.&lt;/math&gt;

and so generally depends on the generalized velocities and coordinates. Since we are free to specify the initial values of the generalized coordinates and velocities separately, the generalized coordinates ''q&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' and velocities ''dq&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''/''dt'' can be treated as ''independent variables''.

===Non-holonomic constraints===

A mechanical system can involve constraints on both the generalized coordinates and their derivatives. Constraints of this type are known as non-holonomic. First-order non-holonomic constraints have the form

:&lt;math&gt;g(\mathbf{q}, \dot{\mathbf{q}}, t) = 0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

An example of such a constraint is a rolling wheel or knife-edge that constrains the direction of the velocity vector. Non-holonomic constraints can also involve next-order derivatives such as generalized accelerations.

==Physical quantities in generalized coordinates==

===Kinetic energy===

The total [[kinetic energy]] of the system is the energy of the system's motion, defined as&lt;ref name="Torby 1984 page=269"&gt;{{harvnb|Torby|1984|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac {1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^N m_k \dot{\mathbf{r}}_k \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_k\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which · is the [[dot product]]. The kinetic energy is a function only of the velocities '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, not the coordinates '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; themselves. By contrast an important observation is&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{r}}_k \cdot \dot{\mathbf{r}}_k = \sum_{i,j=1}^n \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_k}{\partial q_i}\cdot\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_k}{\partial q_j}\right)\dot{q}_i\dot{q}_j , &lt;/math&gt;

which illustrates the kinetic energy is in general a function of the generalized velocities, coordinates, and time if the constraints also vary with time, so ''T'' = ''T''('''q''', ''d'''''q'''/''dt'', ''t'').

In the case the constraints on the particles are time-independent, then all partial derivatives with respect to time are zero, and the kinetic energy is a [[homogeneous function]] of degree 2 in the generalized velocities.

Still for the time-independent case, this expression is equivalent to taking the [[line element]] squared of the trajectory for particle ''k'',

:&lt;math&gt;ds_k^2 = d\mathbf{r}_k\cdot d\mathbf{r}_k = \sum_{i,j=1}^n \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_k}{\partial q_i}\cdot\frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_k}{\partial q_j}\right) dq_i dq_j \,,&lt;/math&gt;

and dividing by the square differential in time, ''dt''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, to obtain the velocity squared of particle ''k''. Thus for time-independent constraints it is sufficient to know the line element to quickly obtain the kinetic energy of particles and hence the Lagrangian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|edition=3rd|1976|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is instructive to see the various cases of polar coordinates in 2d and 3d, owing to their frequent appearance.  In 2d [[polar coordinates]] (''r'', ''θ''),

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{ds}{dt}\right)^2 = \dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

in 3d [[cylindrical coordinates]] (''r'', ''θ'', ''z''),

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{ds}{dt}\right)^2 = \dot{r}^2 + r^2\dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{z}^2 \,,&lt;/math&gt;

in 3d [[spherical coordinates]] (''r'', ''θ'', ''φ''),

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{ds}{dt}\right)^2 = \dot{r}^2+r^2\dot{\theta}^2 +r^2\sin^2\theta \, \dot{\varphi}^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Generalized momentum===

The ''generalized momentum'' "canonically conjugate to" the coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;p_i =\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot q_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the Lagrangian ''L'' does ''not'' depend on some coordinate ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', then it follows from the Euler–Lagrange equations that the corresponding generalized momentum will be a [[conserved quantity]], because the time derivative is zero implying the momentum is a constant of the motion;

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{p}_i = \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot q_i} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}=0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

===Bead on a wire===

[[File:Bead on wire constraint.svg|thumb|200px|Bead constrained to move on a frictionless wire. The wire exerts a reaction force '''C''' on the bead to keep it on the wire. The non-constraint force '''N''' in this case is gravity. Notice the initial position of the wire can lead to different motions.]]

For a bead sliding on a frictionless wire subject only to gravity in 2d space, the constraint on the bead can be stated in the form ''f''('''r''') = 0, where the position of the bead can be written '''r''' = (''x''(''s''), ''y''(''s'')), in which ''s'' is a parameter, the [[arc length]] ''s'' along the curve from some point on the wire. This is a suitable choice of generalized coordinate for the system. Only ''one'' coordinate is needed instead of two, because the position of the bead can be parameterized by one number, ''s'', and the constraint equation connects the two coordinates ''x'' and ''y''; either one is determined from the other. The constraint force is the reaction force the wire exerts on the bead to keep it on the wire, and the non-constraint applied force is gravity acting on the bead.

Suppose the wire changes its shape with time, by flexing. Then the constraint equation and position of the particle are respectively

:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{r}, t) = 0 \,,\quad \mathbf{r} = (x(s, t), y(s, t))&lt;/math&gt;

which now both depend on time ''t'' due to the changing coordinates as the wire changes its shape. Notice time appears implicitly via the coordinates ''and'' explicitly in the constraint equations.

===Simple pendulum===
[[File:Pendulum constraint.svg|150px|thumb|Simple pendulum. Since the rod is rigid, the position of the bob is constrained according to the equation ''f''(''x'', ''y'') = 0, the constraint force '''C''' is the tension in the rod. Again the non-constraint force '''N''' in this case is gravity.]]

[[File:Simple pendulum generalized coordinates.svg|thumb|Dynamic model of a simple pendulum.]]
The relationship between the use of generalized coordinates and Cartesian coordinates to characterize the movement of a mechanical system can be illustrated by considering the constrained dynamics of a simple pendulum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A simple [[pendulum]] consists of a mass M hanging from a pivot point so that it is constrained to move on a circle of radius L.  The position of the mass is defined by the coordinate vector '''r'''=(x, y) measured in the plane of the circle such that y is in the vertical direction.  The coordinates x and y are related by the equation of the circle
:&lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = x^2+y^2 - L^2=0,&lt;/math&gt;
that constrains the movement of M.  This equation also provides a constraint on the velocity components,
:&lt;math&gt; \dot{f}(x, y)=2x\dot{x} + 2y\dot{y} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Now introduce the parameter θ, that defines the angular position of M from the vertical direction.  It can be used to define the coordinates x and y, such that
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r}=(x, y) = (L\sin\theta, -L\cos\theta).&lt;/math&gt;
The use of θ to define the configuration of this system avoids the constraint provided by the equation of the circle.

Notice that the force of gravity acting on the mass m is formulated in the usual Cartesian coordinates,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}=(0,-mg),&lt;/math&gt;
where g is the acceleration of gravity.

The [[virtual work]] of gravity on the mass m as it follows the trajectory '''r''' is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = \mathbf{F}\cdot\delta \mathbf{r}.&lt;/math&gt;
The variation δ'''r''' can be computed in terms of the coordinates x and y, or in terms of the parameter θ,
:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathbf{r} =(\delta x, \delta y) = (L\cos\theta, L\sin\theta)\delta\theta.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the virtual work is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = -mg\delta y = -mgL\sin\theta\delta\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the coefficient of δy is the y-component of the applied force.  In the same way, the coefficient of δθ is known as the [[generalized force]] along generalized coordinate θ, given by
:&lt;math&gt; F_{\theta} =  -mgL\sin\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

To complete the analysis consider the kinetic energy T of the mass, using the velocity,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}=(\dot{x}, \dot{y}) = (L\cos\theta, L\sin\theta)\dot{\theta},&lt;/math&gt;
so,
:&lt;math&gt; T= \frac{1}{2} m\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{v} = \frac{1}{2} m (\dot{x}^2+\dot{y}^2) = \frac{1}{2} m L^2\dot{\theta}^2.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Virtual work#D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work|D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work]] for the pendulum in terms of the coordinates x and y are given by,
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{x}} - \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = F_{x} + \lambda \frac{\partial f}{\partial x},\quad \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{y}} - \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} = F_{y} + \lambda \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}.  &lt;/math&gt;
This yields the three equations
:&lt;math&gt;m\ddot{x} = \lambda(2x),\quad m\ddot{y} = -mg + \lambda(2y),\quad x^2+y^2 - L^2=0,&lt;/math&gt;
in the three unknowns, x, y and λ.

Using the parameter θ, those equations take the form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{\theta}} - \frac{\partial T}{\partial \theta} = F_{\theta},&lt;/math&gt;
which becomes,
:&lt;math&gt; mL^2\ddot{\theta} = -mgL\sin\theta,&lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt; \ddot{\theta} + \frac{g}{L}\sin\theta=0.&lt;/math&gt;
This formulation yields one equation because there is a single parameter and no constraint equation.

This shows that the parameter θ is a generalized coordinate that can be used in the same way as the Cartesian coordinates x and y to analyze the pendulum.

===Double pendulum===
[[File:Double-Pendulum.svg|thumb|right|A [[double pendulum]]]]
The benefits of generalized coordinates become apparent with the analysis of a double pendulum.  
For the two masses m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, i=1, 2, let  '''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''=(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), i=1, 2 define their two trajectories.  These vectors satisfy the two constraint equations,
:&lt;math&gt;f_1 (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) = \mathbf{r}_1\cdot \mathbf{r}_1 - L_1^2 = 0, \quad f_2 (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2) = (\mathbf{r}_2-\mathbf{r}_1) \cdot  (\mathbf{r}_2-\mathbf{r}_1) - L_2^2 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The formulation of Lagrange's equations for this system yields six equations in the four Cartesian coordinates x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; i=1, 2 and the two Lagrange multipliers λ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, i=1, 2 that arise from the two constraint equations.

Now introduce the generalized coordinates θ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; i=1,2 that define the angular position of each mass of the double pendulum from the vertical direction.  In this case, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1 = (L_1\sin\theta_1, -L_1\cos\theta_1), \quad \mathbf{r}_2 = (L_1\sin\theta_1, -L_1\cos\theta_1) + (L_2\sin\theta_2, -L_2\cos\theta_2).&lt;/math&gt;

The force of gravity acting on the masses is given by,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_1=(0,-m_1 g),\quad \mathbf{F}_2=(0,-m_2 g)&lt;/math&gt;
where g is the acceleration of gravity.  Therefore, the virtual work of gravity on the two masses as they follow the trajectories '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, i=1,2 is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = \mathbf{F}_1\cdot\delta \mathbf{r}_1 + \mathbf{F}_2\cdot\delta \mathbf{r}_2.&lt;/math&gt;

The variations δ'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; i=1, 2 can be computed to be
:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathbf{r}_1 = (L_1\cos\theta_1, L_1\sin\theta_1)\delta\theta_1, \quad \delta \mathbf{r}_2 = (L_1\cos\theta_1, L_1\sin\theta_1)\delta\theta_1 +(L_2\cos\theta_2, L_2\sin\theta_2)\delta\theta_2&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the virtual work is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\delta W =  -(m_1+m_2)gL_1\sin\theta_1\delta\theta_1 - m_2gL_2\sin\theta_2\delta\theta_2,&lt;/math&gt;
and the generalized forces are
:&lt;math&gt;F_{\theta_1} =  -(m_1+m_2)gL_1\sin\theta_1,\quad F_{\theta_2} =  -m_2gL_2\sin\theta_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Compute the kinetic energy of this system to be
:&lt;math&gt; T= \frac{1}{2}m_1 \mathbf{v}_1\cdot\mathbf{v}_1 + \frac{1}{2}m_2 \mathbf{v}_2\cdot\mathbf{v}_2 = \frac{1}{2}(m_1+m_2)L_1^2\dot{\theta}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_2L_2^2\dot{\theta}_2^2 + m_2L_1L_2 \cos(\theta_2-\theta_1)\dot{\theta}_1\dot{\theta}_2.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Euler–Lagrange equation]] yield two equations in the unknown generalized coordinates θ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; i=1, 2, given by&lt;ref&gt;Eric W. Weisstein, [http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/DoublePendulum.html Double Pendulum], scienceworld.wolfram.com. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(m_1+m_2)L_1^2\ddot{\theta}_1+m_2L_1L_2\ddot{\theta}_2\cos(\theta_2-\theta_1) + m_2L_1L_2\ddot{\theta_2}^2\sin(\theta_1-\theta_2) = -(m_1+m_2)gL_1\sin\theta_1,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;m_2L_2^2\ddot{\theta}_2+m_2L_1L_2\ddot{\theta}_1\cos(\theta_2-\theta_1) + m_2L_1L_2\ddot{\theta_1}^2\sin(\theta_2-\theta_1)=-m_2gL_2\sin\theta_2.&lt;/math&gt;

The use of the generalized coordinates θ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; i=1, 2 provides an alternative to the Cartesian formulation of the dynamics of the double pendulum.

===Spherical pendulum===

[[File:Spherical pendulum Lagrangian mechanics.svg|thumb|200px|Spherical pendulum: angles and velocities.]]

For a 3d example, a [[spherical pendulum]] with constant length ''l'' free to swing in any angular direction subject to gravity, the constraint on the pendulum bob can be stated in the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathbf{r}) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - l^2 = 0 \,, &lt;/math&gt;

where the position of the pendulum bob can be written

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = (x(\theta,\phi),y(\theta,\phi),z(\theta,\phi)) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

in which (''θ'', ''φ'') are the [[spherical coordinates|spherical polar angles]] because the bob moves in the surface of a sphere. The position '''r''' is measured along the suspension point to the bob, here treated as a [[point particle]]. A logical choice of generalized coordinates to describe the motion are the angles (''θ'', ''φ''). Only two coordinates are needed instead of three, because the position of the bob can be parameterized by two numbers, and the constraint equation connects the three coordinates ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' so any one of them is determined from the other two.

==Generalized coordinates and virtual work==
The ''principle of virtual work'' states that if a system is in static equilibrium, the virtual work of the applied forces is zero for all virtual movements of the system from this state, that is, δW=0 for any variation δ'''r'''.&lt;ref name="Torby1984"&gt;{{cite book |last=Torby |first=Bruce |title=Advanced Dynamics for Engineers |series=HRW Series in Mechanical Engineering |year=1984 |publisher=CBS College Publishing |location=United States of America  |isbn=0-03-063366-4 |chapter=Energy Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When formulated in terms of generalized coordinates, this is equivalent to the requirement that the generalized forces for any virtual displacement are zero, that is ''F''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;=0.

Let the forces on the system be '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, ''j=1, ..., m'' be applied to points with Cartesian coordinates '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, j=1,..., m, then the virtual work generated by a virtual displacement from the equilibrium position is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = \sum_{j=1}^m \mathbf{F}_j\cdot \delta\mathbf{r}_j.&lt;/math&gt;
where δ'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, ''j=1, ..., m'' denote the virtual displacements of each point in the body.

Now assume that each δ'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; depends on the generalized coordinates ''q''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i=1, ..., n'', then
:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathbf{r}_j = \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_j}{\partial q_1} \delta{q}_1 + \ldots + \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_j}{\partial q_n} \delta{q}_n,&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = \left(\sum_{j=1}^m \mathbf{F}_j\cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_j}{\partial q_1}\right) \delta{q}_1 + \ldots + \left(\sum_{j=1}^m \mathbf{F}_j\cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_j}{\partial q_n}\right) \delta{q}_n. &lt;/math&gt;

The ''n'' terms
:&lt;math&gt; F_i = \sum_{j=1}^m \mathbf{F}_j\cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{r}_j}{\partial q_i},\quad i=1,\ldots, n,&lt;/math&gt;
are the generalized forces acting on the system.   Kane&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Kane and D. A. Levinson, Dynamics: theory and applications, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; shows that these generalized forces can also be formulated in terms of the ratio of time derivatives,
:&lt;math&gt; F_i = \sum_{j=1}^m \mathbf{F}_j\cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}_j}{\partial \dot{q}_i},\quad i=1,\ldots, n,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; is the velocity of the point of application of the force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;.

In order for the virtual work to be zero for an arbitrary virtual  displacement, each of the generalized forces must be zero, that is
:&lt;math&gt; \delta W = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad F_i =0, i=1,\ldots, n.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[statistics]] and [[coding theory]], a '''[[Richard Hamming|Hamming]] space''' is usually the set of all &lt;math&gt;2^N&lt;/math&gt; [[binary string]]s of length ''N''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Error Correcting Codes: A Mathematical Introduction|volume=15|series=Chapman Hall/CRC Mathematics Series|first=D.

More generally, a Hamming space can be defined over any [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] (set) ''Q'' as the set of [[word (mathematics)|words]] of a fixed length ''N'' with letters from ''Q''.&lt;ref name="Robinson2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cc15"&gt;Cohen et al., ''Covering Codes'', p.&amp;nbsp;15&lt;/ref&gt; If ''Q'' is a [[finite field]], then a Hamming space over ''Q'' is an ''N''-dimensional [[vector space]] over ''Q''. In the typical, binary case, the field is thus [[GF(2)]] (also denoted by '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Robinson2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Derek J.S. Robinson|title=An Introduction to Abstract Algebra|year=2003|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-019816-4|pages=254–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In coding theory, if ''Q'' has ''q'' elements, then any [[subset]] ''C'' (usually assumed of [[cardinality]] at least two) of the ''N''-dimensional Hamming space over ''Q'' is called a '''q-ary [[code]] of length N'''; the elements of ''C'' are called '''[[codeword]]s'''.&lt;ref name="Robinson2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cc15"/&gt; In the case where ''C'' is a [[linear subspace]] of its Hamming space, it is called a [[linear code]].&lt;ref name="Robinson2003"/&gt; A typical example of linear code is the [[Hamming code]]. Codes defined via a Hamming space necessarily have the same length for every codeword, so they are called [[block code]]s when it is necessary to distinguish them from [[variable-length code]]s that are defined by unique factorization on a monoid.

The [[Hamming distance]] endows a Hamming space with a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], which is essential in defining basic notions of coding theory such as [[Error detection and correction|error detecting and error correcting codes]].&lt;ref name="Robinson2003"/&gt;

Hamming spaces over non-field alphabets have also been considered, especially over [[finite ring]]s (most notably over [[modulo arithmetic|'''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]) giving rise to [[module (mathematics)|module]]s instead of vector spaces and [[ring-linear code]]s (identified with [[submodule]]s) instead of linear codes. The typical metric used in this case the [[Lee distance]]. There exist a [[Gray isometry]] between &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2^{2m}&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. GF(2&lt;sup&gt;2m&lt;/sup&gt;)) with the Hamming distance and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_4^m&lt;/math&gt; (also denoted as GR(4,m)) with the Lee distance.&lt;ref name="Greferath2009"&gt;{{cite book|editors=Massimiliano Sala, Teo Mora, Ludovic Perret, Shojiro Sakata, Carlo Traverso|title=Gröbner Bases, Coding, and Cryptography|year=2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-93806-4|chapter=An Introduction to Ring-Linear Coding Theory|author=Marcus Greferath}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Kerdock_and_Preparata_codes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lint1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.H. van Lint|title=Introduction to Coding Theory|year=1999|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-64133-9|edition=3rd|at=Chapter 8: Codes over ℤ&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1844">'''Hilbert's ninth problem''', from the list of 23 [[Hilbert's problems]] (1900), asked to find the most general [[reciprocity law (mathematics)|reciprocity law]] for the [[Hilbert symbol|norm residues]] of ''k''-th order in a general [[algebraic number field]], where ''k'' is a power of a [[prime number|prime]]. 

== Progress made ==

The problem was partially solved by [[Emil Artin]] (1924; 1927; 1930) by establishing the [[Artin reciprocity law]] which deals with [[abelian extension]]s of [[algebraic number field]]s. Together with the work of [[Teiji Takagi]] and [[Helmut Hasse]] (who established the more general Hasse reciprocity law), this led to the development of the [[class field theory]], realizing Hilbert's program in an abstract fashion. Certain explicit formulas for norm residues were later found by [[Igor Shafarevich]] (1948; 1949; 1950).
 
The [[Non-abelian class field theory|non-abelian generalization]], also connected with [[Hilbert's twelfth problem]], is one of the long-standing challenges in number theory and is far from being complete.

'''IsaPlanner'''&lt;ref&gt;IsaPlanner 2: A Proof Planner in Isabelle. Lucas Dixon and Moa Johansson. System Description/Technical Report. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Proof planning|proof planner]] for the interactive [[proof assistant]], [[Isabelle theorem prover|Isabelle]].  Originally developed by Lucas Dixon&lt;ref&gt;A Proof Planning Framework for Isabelle.  Lucas Dixon.  PhD Thesis, University of Edinburgh.  2005.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of his PhD thesis at the [[University of Edinburgh]], it is now maintained by members of the Mathematical Reasoning Group, in the [[University of Edinburgh School of Informatics|School of Informatics]] at Edinburgh.
IsaPlanner is the latest of a series of proof planners written at Edinburgh.  Earlier planners include Clam and LambdaClam.

== Features ==
IsaPlanner allows the user to encode reasoning techniques, using a [[combinator|combinator language]], for [[conjecture|conjecturing]] and [[mathematical proof|proving]] [[theorem]]s.  IsaPlanner works by manipulating reasoning states, records of open goals, the current proof plan and other important information, and combinators are functions mapping reasoning states to [[lazy evaluation|lazy lists]] of successor reasoning states.

IsaPlanner's library supplies combinators for branching and [[iteration]], amongst other tasks, and powerful reasoning techniques can be created by combining simpler reasoning techniques with these combinators.

Several reasoning techniques come ready implemented within IsaPlanner, notably, IsaPlanner features an implementation of dynamic [[rippling]], a rippling [[heuristic]] capable of working in [[higher-order logic|higher order]] settings, a [[best first search|best-first]] rippling heuristic and a reasoning technique for proofs by [[mathematical induction|induction]].

Additional features include an interactive tracing tool, for manually stepping through proof attempts and a module for viewing and manipulating [[hierarchical]] proofs.

== Planned features ==
Features currently being implemented, or planned for the future, are an expanded set of [[proof critics]], suitable for use in higher order domains, dynamic relational rippling, a rippling heuristic suitable for rippling over [[Relation (mathematics)|relational]] [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]] as opposed to [[function (mathematics)|functional]] expressions, again suitable for use in higher order domains, and integration of IsaPlanner with [[Proof General]].

He made significant contributions to the fields of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[number theory]], and both [[classical mechanics|classical]] and [[celestial mechanics]].

In 1766, on the recommendation of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]], Lagrange succeeded Euler as the director of mathematics at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in Berlin, [[Prussia]], where he stayed for over twenty years, producing volumes of work and winning several prizes of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. Lagrange's treatise on [[analytical mechanics]] (''[[Mécanique analytique]]'', 4. ed., 2 vols. Paris: Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1788–89), written in Berlin and first published in 1788, offered the most comprehensive treatment of classical mechanics since [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and formed a basis for the development of mathematical physics in the nineteenth century.

In 1787, at age 51, he moved from Berlin to Paris and became a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He remained in France until the end of his life. He was significantly involved in the [[History of the metric system|decimalisation]] in [[French First Republic|Revolutionary France]], became the first professor of analysis at the [[École Polytechnique]] upon its opening in 1794, was a founding member of the [[Bureau des Longitudes]], and became [[Sénat conservateur|Senator]] in 1799.

==Scientific contribution==
Lagrange was one of the creators of the [[calculus of variations]], deriving the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s for extrema of [[Functional (mathematics)|functionals]]. He also extended the method to take into account possible constraints, arriving at the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]].
Lagrange invented the method of solving [[differential equation]]s known as [[method of variation of parameters|variation of parameters]], applied [[differential calculus]] to the [[probability theory|theory of probabilities]] and attained notable work on the solution of [[algebraic equation|equations]]. He proved that [[Lagrange's four-square theorem|every natural number is a sum of four squares]]. His treatise ''Theorie des fonctions analytiques'' laid some of the foundations of [[group theory]], anticipating [[Évariste Galois|Galois]]. In [[calculus]], Lagrange developed a novel approach to [[Lagrange interpolation|interpolation]] and [[Taylor series]]. He studied the [[three-body problem]] for the Earth, Sun and Moon (1764) and the movement of Jupiter's satellites (1766), and in 1772 found the special-case solutions to this problem that yield what are now known as [[Lagrangian point]]s. But above all, he is best known for his work on mechanics, where he transformed [[Newtonian mechanics]] into a branch of analysis, [[Lagrangian mechanics]] as it is now called, and presented the so-called mechanical "principles" as simple results of the variational calculus.

In appearance he was of medium height, and slightly formed, with pale blue eyes and a colourless complexion. In character he was nervous and timid, he detested controversy, and to avoid it willingly allowed others to take the credit for what he had himself done. 
 
He always thought out the subject of his papers before he began to compose them, and usually wrote them straight off without a single erasure or correction.

=== Early years ===
Born as ''Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia'', Lagrange was of Italian and French descent. His paternal great-grandfather was a [[kingdom of France|French]] army officer who had moved to Turin, the ''de facto'' capital of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] at Lagrange's time, and married an Italian; so did his grandfather and his father. His mother was from the countryside of [[Turin]].&lt;ref name="St Andrew"&gt;[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Lagrange.html Lagrange] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325121637/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Lagrange.html |date=25 March 2007 }} St. Andrew University&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised as a [[Roman Catholic]] (but later on became an [[agnostic]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematics and the Search for Knowledge|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-504230-6|author=Morris Kline|page=214|quote=Lagrange and Laplace, though of Catholic parentage, were agnostics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father, who had charge of the [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia|king's]] military chest and was Treasurer of the Office of Public Works and Fortifications in Turin, should have maintained a good social position and wealth, but before his son grew up he had lost most of his property in speculations. A career as a lawyer was planned out for Lagrange by his father, and certainly Lagrange seems to have accepted this willingly. He studied at the [[University of Turin]] and his favourite subject was classical Latin. At first he had no great enthusiasm for mathematics, finding Greek geometry rather dull.

It was not until he was seventeen that he showed any taste for mathematics – his interest in the subject being first excited by a paper by [[Edmond Halley]] which he came across by accident. Alone and unaided he threw himself into mathematical studies; at the end of a year's incessant toil he was already an accomplished mathematician.  [[Charles Emmanuel III]] appointed Lagrange to serve as the "Sostituto del Maestro di Matematica" (mathematics assistant professor) at the Royal Military Academy of the Theory and Practice of Artillery in 1755, where he taught courses in calculus and mechanics to support the Piedmontese army's early adoption of the ballistics theories of [[Benjamin Robins]] and [[Leonhard Euler]].  In that capacity, Lagrange was the first to teach calculus in an engineering school.  According to [[:it:Alessandro Vittorio Papacino D'Antoni|Alessandro Papacino D'Antoni]], the academy's military commander and famous artillery theorist, Lagrange unfortunately proved to be a problematic professor with his oblivious teaching style, abstract reasoning, and impatience with artillery and fortification-engineering applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steele|first=Brett|title=The Heirs of Archimedes: Science and the Art of War through the Age of Enlightenment|date=2005|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-262-19516-X|pages=368, 375|authorlink=Military 'Progress' and Newtonian Science|editor=Brett Steele |editor2=Tamera Dorland|chapter=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Academy one of his students was [[François Daviet de Foncenex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = de Andrade Martins | first = Roberto | chapter = A busca da Ciência ''a priori'' no final do Seculo XVIII e a origem da Análise dimensional | editor= Roberto de Andrade Martins |editor2=Lilian Al-Chueyr Pereira Martins |editor3=Cibelle Celestino Silva |editor4=Juliana Mesquita Hidalgo Ferreira (eds.) | title = Filosofia E Historia Da Ciência No Cone Sul. 3 Encontro | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yiuwanC2NlYC | date = 2008 | publisher = AFHIC | page = 406 | isbn = 978-1-4357-1633-9|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Variational calculus ====
Lagrange is one of the founders of the [[calculus of variations]]. Starting in 1754, he worked on the problem of [[tautochrone]], discovering a method of maximising and minimising functionals in a way similar to finding extrema of functions. Lagrange wrote several letters to [[Leonhard Euler]] between 1754 and 1756 describing his results. He outlined his "δ-algorithm", leading to the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s of variational calculus and considerably simplifying Euler's earlier analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Although some authors speak of general method of solving "[[isoperimetric]] problems", the eighteenth century meaning of this expression amounts to "problems in variational calculus", reserving the adjective "relative" for problems with isoperimetric-type constraints. The celebrated method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], which applies to optimization of functions of several variables subject to constraints, did not appear until much later. See {{cite journal | last = Fraser | first = Craig | title = Isoperimetric Problems in the Variational Calculus of Euler and Lagrange | journal = Historia Mathematica | volume = 19 | pages = 4–23 |year = 1992 | doi = 10.1016/0315-0860(92)90052-D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lagrange also applied his ideas to problems of classical mechanics, generalising the results of Euler and [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]].

Euler was very impressed with Lagrange's results. It has been stated that "with characteristic courtesy he withheld a paper he had previously written, which covered some of the same ground, in order that the young Italian might have time to complete his work, and claim the undisputed invention of the new calculus"; however, this chivalric view has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Galletto, D., ''The genesis of Mécanique analytique'', La Mécanique analytique de Lagrange et son héritage, II (Turin, 1989). Atti Accad. Sci. Torino Cl. Sci. Fis. Mat. Natur. 126 (1992), suppl. 2, 277–370, {{MathSciNet|id=1264671}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lagrange published his method in two memoirs of the Turin Society in 1762 and 1773.

==== Miscellanea Taurinensia ====
In 1758, with the aid of his pupils (mainly Daviet de Foncenex), Lagrange established a society, which was subsequently incorporated as the [[Turin Academy of Sciences]], and most of his early writings are to be found in the five volumes of its transactions, usually known as the ''Miscellanea Taurinensia''. Many of these are elaborate papers. The first volume contains a paper on the theory of the propagation of sound; in this he indicates a mistake made by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], obtains the general [[differential equation]] for the motion, and integrates it for motion in a straight line. This volume also contains the complete solution of the problem of a [[vibrating string|string vibrating transversely]]; in this paper he points out a lack of generality in the solutions previously given by [[Brook Taylor]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D'Alembert]], and Euler, and arrives at the conclusion that the form of the curve at any time ''t'' is given by the equation &lt;math&gt;y = a \sin (mx) \sin (nt)\,&lt;/math&gt;. The article concludes with a masterly discussion of [[echo (phenomenon)|echo]]es, [[beat (acoustics)|beat]]s, and compound sounds. Other articles in this volume are on [[recurrence relation|recurring]] [[series (mathematics)|series]], [[probability|probabilities]], and the [[calculus of variations]].

The second volume contains a long paper embodying the results of several papers in the first volume on the theory and notation of the calculus of variations; and he illustrates its use by deducing the [[principle of least action]], and by solutions of various problems in [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]].

The third volume includes the solution of several dynamical problems by means of the calculus of variations; some papers on the [[integral calculus]]; a solution of [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]]'s problem mentioned above: given an integer ''n'' which is not a [[square number|perfect square]], to find a number ''x'' such that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is a perfect square; and the general differential equations of [[N-body problem|motion for three bodies]] moving under their mutual attractions.

The next work he produced was in 1764 on the [[libration]] of the [[Moon]], and an explanation as to why the same face was always turned to the earth, a problem which he treated by the aid of [[virtual work]]. His solution is especially interesting as containing the germ of the idea of generalised equations of motion, equations which he first formally proved in 1780.

=== Berlin ===
Already in 1756, [[Euler]] and [[Maupertuis]], seeing his mathematical talent, tried to persuade him to come to Berlin, but Lagrange had no such intention and shyly refused the offer. In 1765, [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|d'Alembert]] interceded on Lagrange's behalf with [[Frederick the Great|Frederick of Prussia]] and by letter, asked him to leave Turin for a considerably more prestigious position in Berlin. Lagrange again turned down the offer, responding that&lt;ref name="Vinter2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard B. Vinter|title=Optimal Control|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PY9xscfbfiYC|date=2000|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-8176-4075-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|361}}
: ''It seems to me that Berlin would not be at all suitable for me while M.Euler is there''.

In 1766, Euler left Berlin for [[Saint Petersburg]], and Frederick himself wrote to Lagrange expressing the wish of "the greatest king in Europe" to have "the greatest mathematician in Europe" resident at his court. Lagrange was finally persuaded and he spent the next twenty years in [[Prussia]], where he produced not only the long series of papers published in the Berlin and Turin transactions, but also his monumental work, the ''Mécanique analytique''. In 1767, he married his cousin Vittoria Conti.

Lagrange was a favourite of the king, who used frequently to discourse to him on the advantages of perfect regularity of life. The lesson went home, and thenceforth Lagrange studied his mind and body as though they were machines, and found by experiment the exact amount of work which he was able to do without breaking down. Every night he set himself a definite task for the next day, and on completing any branch of a subject he wrote a short analysis to see what points in the demonstrations or in the subject-matter were capable of improvement. He always thought out the subject of his papers before he began to compose them, and usually wrote them straight off without a single erasure or correction.

Nonetheless, during his years in Berlin, Lagrange's health was rather poor on many occasions, and that of his wife Vittoria was even worse. She died in 1783 after years of illness and Lagrange was very depressed. In 1786, Frederick II died, and the climate of Berlin became rather trying for Lagrange.&lt;ref name="St Andrew" /&gt;

=== Paris ===
In 1786, following Frederick's death, Lagrange received similar invitations from states including Spain and [[Naples]], and he accepted the offer of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] to move to Paris. In France he was received with every mark of distinction and special apartments in the Louvre were prepared for his reception, and he became a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], which later became part of the [[French Institute|Institut de France]] (1795). At the beginning of his residence in Paris he was seized with an attack of melancholy, and even the printed copy of his ''Mécanique'' on which he had worked for a quarter of a century lay for more than two years unopened on his desk. Curiosity as to the results of the [[French revolution]] first stirred him out of his lethargy, a curiosity which soon turned to alarm as the revolution developed.

It was about the same time, 1792, that the unaccountable sadness of his life and his timidity moved the compassion of 24-year-old Renée-Françoise-Adélaïde Le Monnier, daughter of his friend, the astronomer [[Pierre Charles Le Monnier]]. She insisted on marrying him, and proved a devoted wife to whom he became warmly attached.

In September 1793, the [[Reign of Terror]] began. Under intervention of Antoine [[Lavoisier]], who himself was by then already thrown out of the Academy along with many other scholars, Lagrange was specifically exempted by name in the decree of October 1793 that ordered all foreigners to leave France. On 4 May 1794, Lavoisier and 27 other [[Tax farming|tax farmers]] were arrested and sentenced to death and guillotined on the afternoon after the trial. Lagrange said on the death of Lavoisier:

: ''It took only a moment to cause this head to fall and a hundred years will not suffice to produce its like.''&lt;ref name="St Andrew" /&gt;

Though Lagrange had been preparing to escape from France while there was yet time, he was never in any danger; different revolutionary governments (and at a later time, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]) loaded him with honours and distinctions. This luckiness or safety may to some extent be due to his life attitude he expressed many years before: "''I believe that, in general, one of the first principles of every wise man is to conform strictly to the laws of the country in which he is living, even when they are unreasonable''".&lt;ref name="St Andrew" /&gt; A striking testimony to the respect in which he was held was shown in 1796 when the French commissary in Italy was ordered to attend in full state on Lagrange's father, and tender the congratulations of the republic on the achievements of his son, who "had done honor to all mankind by his genius, and whom it was the special glory of [[Piedmont]] to have produced." It may be added that Napoleon, when he attained power, warmly encouraged scientific studies in France, and was a liberal benefactor of them. Appointed [[Sénat conservateur|senator]] in 1799, he was the first signer of the [[Sénatus-consulte]] which in 1802 annexed his fatherland Piedmont to France.&lt;ref name=laei/&gt; He acquired French citizenship in consequence.&lt;ref name=laei/&gt; The French claimed he was a French mathematician, but the Italians continued to claim him as Italian.''&lt;ref name="St Andrew" /&gt;

==== Units of measurement ====
Lagrange was considerably involved in the process of making new standard units of measurement in the 1790s. He was offered the presidency of the Commission for the reform of weights and measures (''la Commission des Poids et Mesures'') when he was preparing to escape. And after Lavoisier's death in 1794, it was largely owing to Lagrange's influence that the final choice of the unit system of metre and kilogram was settled and the decimal subdivision was finally accepted by the commission of 1799. Lagrange was also one of the founding members of the [[Bureau des Longitudes]] in 1795.

==== École Normale ====
In 1795, Lagrange was appointed to a mathematical chair at the newly established [[École Normale Supérieure|École Normale]], which enjoyed only a brief existence of four months. His lectures there were quite elementary, and contain nothing of any special importance, but they were published because the professors had to "pledge themselves to the representatives of the people and to each other neither to read nor to repeat from memory," and the discourses were ordered to be taken down in shorthand to enable the deputies to see how the professors acquitted themselves.

==== École Polytechnique ====
In 1794, Lagrange was appointed professor of the [[École Polytechnique]]; and his lectures there, described by mathematicians who had the good fortune to be able to attend them, were almost perfect both in form and matter.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Beginning with the merest elements, he led his hearers on until, almost unknown to themselves, they were themselves extending the bounds of the subject: above all he impressed on his pupils the advantage of always using general methods expressed in a symmetrical notation.

But Lagrange does not seem to have been a successful teacher.  [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]], who attended his lectures in 1795, wrote:
:his voice is very feeble, at least in that he does not become heated; he has a very marked Italian accent and pronounces the ''s'' like ''z'' [...] The students, of whom the majority are incapable of appreciating him, give him little welcome, but the ''professeurs'' make amends for it.&lt;ref&gt;Ivor Grattan-Guinness. Convolutions in French Mathematics, 1800–1840. Birkhäuser 1990. Vol. I, p.108. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dHe00X4MDKMC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=%22His+voice+is+very+feeble%22+#v=onepage&amp;q=%22His%20voice%20is%20very%20feeble%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Late years ====
[[File:Lagrange's tomb at the Pantheon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lagrange's tomb in the crypt of the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]]]]
In 1810, Lagrange commenced a thorough revision of the ''Mécanique analytique'', but he was able to complete only about two-thirds of it before his death at Paris in 1813, in 128 [[rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré]]. Napoleon honoured him with the Grand Croix of the Ordre Impérial de la Réunion just two days before he died. He was buried that same year in the Panthéon in Paris. The inscription on his tomb reads in translation:&lt;blockquote&gt;JOSEPH LOUIS LAGRANGE. Senator. Count of the Empire. Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour. Grand Cross of the Imperial [[Order of the Reunion]]. Member of the Institute and the Bureau of Longitude. Born in Turin on 25&amp;nbsp;January 1736. Died in Paris on 10&amp;nbsp;April 1813.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Work in Berlin==
Lagrange was extremely active scientifically during twenty years he spent in Berlin. Not only did he produce his ''Mécanique analytique'', but he contributed between one and two hundred papers to the Academy of Turin, the Berlin Academy, and the French Academy. Some of these are really treatises, and all without exception are of a high order of excellence. Except for a short time when he was ill he produced on average about one paper a month. Of these, note the following as amongst the most important.

First, his contributions to the fourth and fifth volumes, 1766–1773, of the ''Miscellanea Taurinensia''; of which the most important was the one in 1771, in which he discussed how numerous [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations should be combined so as to give the most probable result. And later, his contributions to the first two volumes, 1784–1785, of the transactions of the Turin Academy; to the first of which he contributed a paper on the pressure exerted by fluids in motion, and to the second an article on integration by [[infinite series]], and the kind of problems for which it is suitable.

Most of the papers sent to Paris were on astronomical questions, and among these including his paper on the [[Jupiter|Jovian]] system in 1766, his essay on the problem of three bodies in 1772, his work on the [[secular equation]] of the Moon in 1773, and his treatise on cometary perturbations in 1778. These were all written on subjects proposed by the [[Académie française]], and in each case the prize was awarded to him.

===Lagrangian mechanics===
{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Scientists}}
Between 1772 and 1788, Lagrange re-formulated Classical/Newtonian mechanics to simplify formulas and ease calculations. These mechanics are called [[Lagrangian mechanics]].

===Algebra===
The greater number of his papers during this time were, however, contributed to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]. Several of them deal with questions in [[algebra]].

*His discussion of representations of integers by [[quadratic form]]s (1769) and by more general algebraic forms (1770).
*His tract on the [[Elimination theory|Theory of Elimination]], 1770.
*[[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] that the order of a subgroup H of a group G must divide the order of G.
*His papers of 1770 and 1771 on the general process for solving an [[algebraic equation]] of any degree via the ''[[Lagrange resolvents]]''. This method fails to give a general formula for solutions of an equation of degree five and higher, because the auxiliary equation involved has higher degree than the original one. The significance of this method is that it exhibits the already known formulas for solving equations of second, third, and fourth degrees as manifestations of a single principle, and was foundational in [[Galois theory]]. The complete solution of a binomial equation of any degree is also treated in these papers.
*In 1773, Lagrange considered a [[functional determinant]] of order 3, a special case of a [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]]. He also proved the expression for the [[volume]] of a [[tetrahedron]] with one of the vertices at the origin as the one sixth of the [[absolute value]] of the [[determinant]] formed by the coordinates of the other three vertices.

===Number theory===
Several of his early papers also deal with questions of number theory.

*Lagrange (1766–1769) was the first European to prove that [[Pell's equation]] {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''ny''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}} has a nontrivial solution in the integers for any non-square natural number {{mvar|n}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/no_cache/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=41029 ''Œuvres'', t.1, 671–732]&lt;/ref&gt;
*He proved the theorem, stated by [[Bachet]] without justification, that [[Lagrange's four-square theorem|every positive integer is the sum of four squares]], 1770.
*He proved [[Wilson's theorem]] that (for any integer {{math|''n'' &gt; 1}}): {{mvar|n}} is a prime if and only if {{math|(''n'' − 1)! + 1}} is a multiple of {{mvar|n}}, 1771.
*His papers of 1773, 1775, and 1777 gave demonstrations of several results enunciated by Fermat, and not previously proved.
*His [[List of important publications in mathematics#Recherches d'Arithmétique|Recherches d'Arithmétique]] of 1775 developed a general theory of binary [[quadratic forms]] to handle the general problem of when an integer is representable by the form {{math|''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''by''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''cxy''}}.
*He made contributions to the theory of [[continued fraction]]s.

===Other mathematical work===
There are also numerous articles on various points of [[analytical geometry]]. In two of them, written rather later, in 1792 and 1793, he reduced the [[quadric|equations of the quadrics]] (or conicoids) to their [[canonical form]]s.

During the years from 1772 to 1785, he contributed a long series of papers which created the science of [[partial differential equation]]s. A large part of these results were collected in the second edition of Euler's integral calculus which was published in 1794.

===Astronomy===
Lastly, there are numerous papers on problems in [[astronomy]]. Of these the most important are the following:

*Attempting to solve the [[three-body problem|general three-body problem]], with the consequent discovery of the two constant-pattern solutions, collinear and equilateral, 1772. Those solutions were later seen to explain what are now known as the [[Lagrangian point]]s. &lt;!-- Read Lagrange's "Essai" before fiddling with this entry. --&gt;
*On the attraction of ellipsoids, 1773: this is founded on [[Colin Maclaurin|Maclaurin]]'s work.
*On the secular equation of the Moon, 1773; also noticeable for the earliest introduction of the idea of the potential. The potential of a body at any point is the sum of the mass of every element of the body when divided by its distance from the point. Lagrange showed that if the potential of a body at an external point were known, the attraction in any direction could be at once found. The theory of the potential was elaborated in a paper sent to Berlin in 1777.
*On the motion of the nodes of a planet's [[orbit]], 1774.
*On the stability of the planetary orbits, 1776.
*Two papers in which the method of determining the orbit of a [[comet]] from three observations is completely worked out, 1778 and 1783: this has not indeed proved practically available, but his system of calculating the perturbations by means of mechanical quadratures has formed the basis of most subsequent researches on the subject.
*His determination of the secular and periodic variations of the [[orbital elements|elements]] of the planets, 1781–1784: the upper limits assigned for these agree closely with those obtained later by [[Urbain Le Verrier|Le Verrier]], and Lagrange proceeded as far as the knowledge then possessed of the masses of the planets permitted.
*Three papers on the method of interpolation, 1783, 1792 and 1793: the part of finite differences dealing therewith is now in the same stage as that in which Lagrange left it.

===Mécanique analytique===
Over and above these various papers he composed his great treatise, the ''Mécanique analytique''. In this he lays down the law of virtual work, and from that one fundamental principle, by the aid of the calculus of variations, deduces the whole of [[mechanics]], both of solids and fluids.

The object of the book is to show that the subject is implicitly included in a single principle, and to give general formulae from which any particular result can be obtained. The method of generalised co-ordinates by which he obtained this result is perhaps the most brilliant result of his analysis. Instead of following the motion of each individual part of a material system, as D'Alembert and Euler had done, he showed that, if we determine its configuration by a sufficient number of variables whose number is the same as that of the degrees of freedom possessed by the system, then the kinetic and potential energies of the system can be expressed in terms of those variables, and the differential equations of motion thence deduced by simple differentiation. For example, in dynamics of a rigid system he replaces the consideration of the particular problem by the general equation, which is now usually written in the form

:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{d}{dt}
  \frac{\partial T}{\partial \dot{\theta}}
- \frac{\partial T}{\partial \theta}
+ \frac{\partial V}{\partial \theta} = 0,
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''T'' represents the kinetic energy and ''V'' represents the potential energy of the system.
He then presented what we now know as the method of [[Lagrange multipliers]]—though this is not the first time that method was published—as a means to solve this equation.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Panza, "The Origins of Analytic Mechanics in the 18th Century", in Hans Niels Jahnke (editor), ''A History of Analysis'', 2003, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;
Amongst other minor theorems here given it may suffice to mention the proposition that the kinetic energy imparted by the given impulses to a material system under given constraints is a maximum, and the [[principle of least action]]. All the analysis is so elegant that Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]] said the work could be described only as a scientific poem. Lagrange remarked that mechanics was really a branch of [[pure mathematics]] analogous to a geometry of four dimensions, namely, the time and the three coordinates of the point in space; and it is said that he prided himself that from the beginning to the end of the work there was not a single diagram. At first no printer could be found who would publish the book; but [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]] at last persuaded a Paris firm to undertake it, and it was issued under the supervision of Laplace, Cousin, Legendre (editor) and Condorcet in 1788.&lt;ref name="St Andrew" /&gt;

==Work in France==
=== Differential calculus and calculus of variations ===

Lagrange's lectures on the [[differential calculus]] at École Polytechnique form the basis of his treatise ''Théorie des fonctions analytiques'', which was published in 1797. This work is the extension of an idea contained in a paper he had sent to the Berlin papers in 1772, and its object is to substitute for the differential calculus a group of theorems based on the development of algebraic functions in series, relying in particular on the principle of the [[generality of algebra]].

A somewhat similar method had been previously used by [[John Landen]] in the ''Residual Analysis'', published in London in 1758. Lagrange believed that he could thus get rid of those difficulties, connected with the use of infinitely large and infinitely small quantities, to which philosophers objected in the usual treatment of the differential calculus. The book is divided into three parts: of these, the first treats of the general theory of functions, and gives an algebraic proof of [[Taylor's theorem]], the validity of which is, however, open to question; the second deals with applications to geometry; and the third with applications to mechanics.

Another treatise on the same lines was his ''Leçons sur le calcul des fonctions'', issued in 1804, with the second edition in 1806. It is in this book that Lagrange formulated his celebrated method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], in the context of problems of variational calculus with integral constraints. These works devoted to differential calculus and calculus of variations may be considered as the starting point for the researches of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]], [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]], and [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]].

===Infinitesimals===
At a later period Lagrange fully embraced the use of [[infinitesimal]]s in preference to founding the differential calculus on the study of algebraic forms; and in the preface to the second edition of the ''Mécanique Analytique'', which was issued in 1811, he justifies the employment of infinitesimals, and concludes by saying that:

: ''When we have grasped the spirit of the infinitesimal method, and have verified the exactness of its results either by the geometrical method of prime and ultimate ratios, or by the analytical method of derived functions, we may employ infinitely small quantities as a sure and valuable means of shortening and simplifying our proofs.''

===Number theory===
His ''Résolution des équations numériques'', published in 1798, was also the fruit of his lectures at École Polytechnique. There he gives the method of approximating to the real roots of an equation by means of [[continued fraction]]s, and enunciates several other theorems. In a note at the end he shows how [[Fermat's little theorem]], that is

: &lt;math&gt; a^{p-1}-1 \equiv 0\pmod p &lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is a prime and ''a'' is prime to ''p'', may be applied to give the complete algebraic solution of any binomial equation. He also here explains how the equation whose roots are the squares of the differences of the roots of the original equation may be used so as to give considerable information as to the position and nature of those roots.

===Celestial mechanics===
The theory of the [[planetary motion]]s had formed the subject of some of the most remarkable of Lagrange's Berlin papers. In 1806 the subject was reopened by [[Siméon Poisson|Poisson]], who, in a paper read before the French Academy, showed that Lagrange's formulae led to certain limits for the stability of the orbits. Lagrange, who was present, now discussed the whole subject afresh, and in a letter communicated to the Academy in 1808 explained how, by the variation of arbitrary constants, the periodical and secular inequalities of any system of mutually interacting bodies could be determined.

==Prizes and distinctions==
Euler proposed Lagrange for election to the Berlin Academy and he was elected on 2 September 1756. He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1790, a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1806. In 1808, [[Napoleon]] made Lagrange a Grand Officer of the [[Legion of Honour]] and a [[Count of the Empire]]. He was awarded the Grand Croix of the [[Order of the Reunion|Ordre Impérial de la Réunion]] in 1813, a week before his death in Paris.

Lagrange was awarded the 1764 prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] for his memoir on the [[libration]] of the Moon. In 1766 the Academy proposed a problem of the motion of the [[satellites of Jupiter]], and the prize again was awarded to Lagrange. He also shared or won the prizes of 1772, 1774, and 1778.

Lagrange is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 prominent French scientists]] who were commemorated on plaques at the first stage of the [[Eiffel Tower]] when it first opened. ''Rue Lagrange'' in the 5th Arrondissement in Paris is named after him. In Turin, the street where the house of his birth still stands is named ''via Lagrange''. The [[lunar crater]] [[Lagrange (crater)|Lagrange]] also bears his name.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7375">In [[abstract algebraic logic]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], the '''Leibniz operator''' is a tool used to classify [[deductive system]]s, which have a precise technical definition, and capture a large number of logics. The Leibniz operator was introduced by [[Wim Blok]] and [[Don Pigozzi]], two of the founders of the field, as a means to abstract the well-known [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra|Lindenbaum–Tarski process]], that leads to the 
association of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s to classical [[propositional calculus]], and make it applicable
to as wide a variety of [[sentential logic]]s as possible. It is an 
operator that assigns to a given theory of a given 
sentential logic, perceived as a free algebra
with a consequence operation on its universe, the
largest [[congruence relation|congruence]] on the algebra that is 
compatible with the theory.

==Formulation==

In this article, we introduce the Leibniz 
operator in the special case of classical
propositional calculus, then we abstract it to the general notion applied to an arbitrary sentential logic and, finally, we summarize
some of the most important consequences of
its use in the theory of abstract algebraic 
logic. 

Let 

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}=\langle{\rm Fm},\vdash_{\mathcal{S}}
\rangle&lt;/math&gt; 
denote the classical propositional calculus. According to the classical 
Lindenbaum–Tarski process, given a theory
&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;,
if &lt;math&gt;\equiv_{T}&lt;/math&gt;
denotes the binary relation on the set of formulas 
of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt;, defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\phi\equiv_{T}\psi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;T\vdash_{\mathcal{S}}\phi\leftrightarrow\psi,&lt;/math&gt;
 
where &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; denotes the usual
classical propositional equivalence connective, then
&lt;math&gt;\equiv_{T}&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be a congruence
on the formula algebra. Furthermore, the quotient 
&lt;math&gt;{\rm Fm}/{\equiv_{T}}&lt;/math&gt; is a Boolean algebra
and every Boolean algebra may be formed in this way.

Thus, the variety of Boolean algebras, which is,
in algebraic logic terminology, the 
equivalent [[algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] (algebraic counterpart)
of classical propositional calculus, is the class of
all algebras formed by taking appropriate quotients
of [[free algebra]]s by those special kinds of
congruences.

The condition 
:&lt;math&gt;T\vdash_{\mathcal{S}}\phi\leftrightarrow\psi&lt;/math&gt; 

that defines 
&lt;math&gt;\phi\equiv_{T}\psi&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the 
condition 

:&lt;math&gt;T\vdash_{\mathcal{S}}\phi&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;T\vdash_{\mathcal{S}}\psi&lt;/math&gt;.

Passing now to an arbitrary sentential logic 
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}=\langle{\rm Fm},
\vdash_{\mathcal{S}}\rangle,&lt;/math&gt;

given a theory &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;,
the '''Leibniz congruence''' associated with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is
denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Omega(T)&lt;/math&gt; and is defined, for all
&lt;math&gt;\phi,\psi\in{\rm Fm}&lt;/math&gt;, by

:&lt;math&gt;\phi\Omega(T)\psi&lt;/math&gt; 

if and only if, for every formula 
&lt;math&gt;\alpha(x,\vec{y})&lt;/math&gt; containing a variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
and possibly other variables in the list &lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;,
and all formulas &lt;math&gt;\vec{\chi}&lt;/math&gt; forming a list of the same 
length as that of &lt;math&gt;\vec{y}&lt;/math&gt;, we have that

:&lt;math&gt;T\vdash_{\mathcal{S}}\alpha(\phi,\vec{\chi})&lt;/math&gt;
if and only if &lt;math&gt;T\vdash_{\mathcal{S}}\alpha(\psi,\vec{\chi})&lt;/math&gt;.

It turns out that this binary relation is a [[congruence relation]]
on the formula algebra and, in fact, may alternatively be characterized
as the largest congruence on the formula algebra that is compatible
with the theory &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, in the sense that
if &lt;math&gt;\phi\Omega(T)\psi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T\vdash_{\mathcal{S}}\phi&lt;/math&gt;, then we must have also &lt;math&gt;T\vdash_{\mathcal{S}}\psi&lt;/math&gt;. It is this congruence that
plays the same role as the congruence used in the
traditional Lindenbaum–Tarski process described above in the 
context of an arbitrary sentential logic. 

It is not, however, the case that for arbitrary sentential logics the quotients of the free algebras by
these Leibniz congruences over different theories yield all algebras
in the class that forms the natural algebraic counterpart of the
sentential logic. This phenomenon occurs only in the case
of "nice" logics and one of the main goals of abstract algebraic logic
is to make this vague notion of a logic being "nice", in this
sense, mathematically precise. 

The Leibniz operator 

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;

is the operator that maps a theory &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of a given logic to the 
Leibniz congruence 

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega(T),&lt;/math&gt;

associated with the theory. Thus, formally, 

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega: \mathrm{Th} (\mathcal{S})
\rightarrow{\rm Con}({\rm Fm})&lt;/math&gt; 

is a mapping from the collection 

:&lt;math&gt;{\rm Th}(\mathcal{S})&lt;/math&gt; of the theories of a sentential logic 
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}&lt;/math&gt; to the collection 

:&lt;math&gt;{\rm Con}({\rm Fm})&lt;/math&gt;

of all congruences on the formula algebra &lt;math&gt;{\rm Fm}&lt;/math&gt;
of the sentential logic.

==Hierarchy==&lt;!-- [[Abstract algebraic hierarchy]] redirects here --&gt;

The Leibniz operator and the study of various of its 
properties that may or may not be satisfied for particular
sentential logics have given rise to what is now known as
the '''abstract algebraic hierarchy''' or '''Leibniz hierarchy''' of
sentential logics. Logics are classified in various levels
of this hierarchy depending on how strong a tie exists 
between the logic and its algebraic counterpart.

The properties of the Leibniz operator that help classify
the logics are monotonicity, injectivity, continuity
and commutativity with inverse substitutions. For instance,
[[protoalgebraic]] logics, forming the widest class in the hierarchy,
i.e., the one that lies in the bottom of the hierarchy
and contains all other classes, are characterized by
the monotonicity of the Leibniz operator on their theories.
Other notable classes are formed by the [[equivalential]] logics,
the weakly [[algebraizable]] logics and the algebraizable logics, among others.

There is a generalization of the 
Leibniz operator, in the context of categorical
abstract algebraic logic, that makes it possible
to apply a wide variety of techniques that were
previously applicable only in the sentential logic
framework to logics formalized as [[π-institution|&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;-institutions]].
The &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;-institution framework is significantly wider
in scope than the framework of sentential logics
because it allows incorporating multiple signatures
and quantifiers in the language and it provides a mechanism for
handling logics that are not syntactically based.

'''Leonhard Euler''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔɪ|l|ər}} {{respell|OY|lər}};&lt;ref name=pronun/&gt; {{IPA-de|ˈɔɪlər|lang|De-Euler.ogg}}; 15 April 1707{{spaced ndash}}18 September 1783) was a Swiss [[mathematician]], [[physicist]], [[astronomer]], [[logician]] and [[engineer]], who made important and influential discoveries in many branches of mathematics, such as [[infinitesimal calculus]] and [[graph theory]], while also making pioneering contributions to several branches such as [[topology]] and [[analytic number theory]]. He also introduced much of the modern mathematical terminology and [[Mathematical notation|notation]], particularly for [[mathematical analysis]], such as the notion of a [[function (mathematics)|mathematical function]].&lt;ref name="function"/&gt; He is also known for his work in [[mechanics]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[optics]], [[astronomy]], and [[music theory]].&lt;ref name=eulerarch/&gt;

Euler was one of the most eminent mathematicians of the 18th century and is held to be one of the greatest in history. He is also widely considered to be the most prolific mathematician of all time. His collected works fill 60 to 80 [[quarto (text)|quarto]] volumes,&lt;ref name="volumes"/&gt; more than anybody in the field. He spent most of his adult life in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], and in [[Berlin]], then the capital of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].

A statement attributed to [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] expresses Euler's influence on mathematics: "Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all."&lt;ref name="Laplace"/&gt;&lt;ref name=libri/&gt;

==Life==

===Early years===
Leonhard Euler was born on 15 April 1707, in [[Basel]], Switzerland to Paul III Euler, a pastor of the [[Reformed Church]], and Marguerite {{née}} Brucker, a pastor's daughter. He had two younger sisters: Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena, and a younger brother Johann Heinrich.&lt;ref name=Calinger&gt;{{Cite book| last = Calinger | first = Ronald S. | title = Leonhard Euler: Mathematical Genius in the Enlightenment | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2015 | page = 11 | isbn = 978-0691119274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the birth of Leonhard, the Eulers moved from Basel to the town of [[Riehen]], where Euler spent most of his childhood. Paul Euler was a friend of the [[Bernoulli family]]; [[Johann Bernoulli]] was then regarded as Europe's foremost mathematician, and would eventually be the most important influence on young Leonhard.

Euler's formal education started in Basel, where he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother. In 1720, aged thirteen, he enrolled at the [[University of Basel]], and in 1723, he received a Master of Philosophy with a dissertation that compared the philosophies of [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. During that time, he was receiving Saturday afternoon lessons from [[Johann Bernoulli]], who quickly discovered his new pupil's incredible talent for mathematics.&lt;ref name="childhood"/&gt; At that time Euler's main studies included theology, [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] at his father's urging in order to become a pastor, but Bernoulli convinced his father that Leonhard was destined to become a great mathematician.

In 1726, Euler completed a dissertation on the [[Speed of sound|propagation of sound]] with the title ''De Sono''.&lt;ref name=17cent/&gt; At that time, he was unsuccessfully attempting to obtain a position at the University of Basel. In 1727, he first entered the ''[[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy]] Prize Problem'' competition; the problem that year was to find the best way to place the [[mast (sailing)|masts]] on a ship. [[Pierre Bouguer]], who became known as "the father of naval architecture", won and Euler took second place. Euler later won this annual prize twelve times.&lt;ref name="prize"/&gt;

===Saint Petersburg===
Around this time Johann Bernoulli's two sons, [[Daniel Bernoulli|Daniel]] and [[Nicolaus II Bernoulli|Nicolaus]], were working at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. On 31 July 1726, Nicolaus died of appendicitis after spending less than a year in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Calinger. "Leonhard Euler: The First St. Petersburg Years (1727–1741)". ''Historia Mathematica'' 23, 2 (1996), 121–66,
[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0315086096900154?via%3Dihub read online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mactutor&gt;{{cite web | last1 =O'Connor | first1 = John J. | last2 =Robertson | first2 = Edmund F. | title=Nicolaus (II) Bernoulli| website = MacTutor History of Mathematics archive | publisher = [[University of St Andrews]] |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Bernoulli_Nicolaus%28II%29.html| accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend Euler. In November 1726 Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to Saint Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for a physics professorship at the University of Basel.&lt;ref name="stpetersburg"/&gt;

[[Image:1957 CPA 2000.jpg|thumb|left|1957 [[Soviet Union]] stamp commemorating the 250th birthday of Euler. The text says: 250 years from the birth of the great mathematician, academician Leonhard Euler.]]
Euler arrived in Saint Petersburg on 17 May 1727. He was promoted from his junior post in the medical department of the academy to a position in the mathematics department. He lodged with Daniel Bernoulli with whom he often worked in close collaboration. Euler mastered Russian and settled into life in Saint Petersburg. He also took on an additional job as a medic in the [[Russian Navy]].&lt;ref name="medic"/&gt;

The Academy at Saint Petersburg, established by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]], was intended to improve education in Russia and to close the scientific gap with Western Europe. As a result, it was made especially attractive to foreign scholars like Euler. The academy possessed ample financial resources and a comprehensive library drawn from the private libraries of Peter himself and of the nobility. Very few students were enrolled in the academy in order to lessen the faculty's teaching burden, and the academy emphasized research and offered to its faculty both the time and the freedom to pursue scientific questions.&lt;ref name="prize"/&gt;

The Academy's benefactress, [[Catherine I of Russia|Catherine I]], who had continued the progressive policies of her late husband, died on the day of Euler's arrival. The Russian nobility then gained power upon the ascension of the twelve-year-old [[Peter II of Russia|Peter II]]. The nobility was suspicious of the academy's foreign scientists, and thus cut funding and caused other difficulties for Euler and his colleagues.

Conditions improved slightly after the death of Peter II, and Euler swiftly rose through the ranks in the academy and was made a professor of physics in 1731. Two years later, Daniel Bernoulli, who was fed up with the censorship and hostility he faced at Saint Petersburg, left for Basel. Euler succeeded him as the head of the mathematics department.&lt;ref name="promotion"/&gt;

On 7 January 1734, he married Katharina Gsell (1707–1773), a daughter of [[Georg Gsell]], a painter from the Academy Gymnasium.&lt;ref name=gekker/&gt; The young couple bought a house by the [[Neva River]]. Of their thirteen children, only five survived childhood.&lt;ref name="wife"/&gt;

===Berlin===
[[Image:Euler GDR stamp.jpg|thumb|Stamp of the former [[German Democratic Republic]] honoring Euler on the 200th anniversary of his death. Across the centre it shows his [[Planar graph#Euler's formula|polyhedral formula]], in English written as&amp;nbsp;"''v''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2".]]

Concerned about the continuing turmoil in Russia, Euler left St. Petersburg on 19 June 1741 to take up a post at the ''[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]]'', which he had been offered by [[Frederick the Great of Prussia]]. He lived for 25 years in [[Berlin]], where he wrote over 380 articles. In Berlin, he published the two works for which he would become most renowned: the ''[[Introductio in analysin infinitorum]]'', a text on functions published in 1748, and the ''[[Institutiones calculi differentialis]]'',&lt;ref name=dartm/&gt; published in 1755 on [[differential calculus]].&lt;ref name="Friedrich"/&gt; In 1755, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

In addition, Euler was asked to tutor [[Friederike Charlotte of Brandenburg-Schwedt]], the Princess of [[Anhalt-Dessau]] and Frederick's niece. Euler wrote over 200 letters to her in the early 1760s, which were later compiled into a best-selling volume entitled ''[[Letters to a German Princess|Letters of Euler on different Subjects in Natural Philosophy Addressed to a German Princess]]''.&lt;ref name='Digital Copy of "Letters to a German Princess"'/&gt; This work contained Euler's exposition on various subjects pertaining to physics and mathematics, as well as offering valuable insights into Euler's personality and religious beliefs. This book became more widely read than any of his mathematical works and was published across Europe and in the United States. The popularity of the "Letters" testifies to Euler's ability to communicate scientific matters effectively to a lay audience, a rare ability for a dedicated research scientist.&lt;ref name="Friedrich"/&gt;

Despite Euler's immense contribution to the Academy's prestige, he eventually incurred the ire of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick]] and ended up having to leave Berlin. The Prussian king had a large circle of intellectuals in his court, and he found the mathematician unsophisticated and ill-informed on matters beyond numbers and figures. Euler was a simple, devoutly religious man who never questioned the existing social order or conventional beliefs, in many ways the polar opposite of [[Voltaire]], who enjoyed a high place of prestige at Frederick's court. Euler was not a skilled debater and often made it a point to argue subjects that he knew little about, making him the frequent target of Voltaire's wit.&lt;ref name="Friedrich"/&gt; Frederick also expressed disappointment with Euler's practical engineering abilities:

{{quote|I wanted to have a water jet in my garden: Euler calculated the force of the wheels necessary to raise the water to a reservoir, from where it should fall back through channels, finally spurting out in [[Sanssouci]]. My mill was carried out geometrically and could not raise a mouthful of water closer than fifty paces to the reservoir. Vanity of vanities! Vanity of geometry!&lt;ref name=fredlett/&gt;}}

[[Image:Leonhard Euler.jpg|thumb|1753 portrait of Euler by [[Emanuel Handmann]], which indicates problems with Euler's right eyelid, possibly [[strabismus]]. Euler's left eye, which here appears healthy, was later affected by a [[cataract]].&lt;ref name="blind"/&gt;]]

=== Eyesight deterioration ===

Euler's [[eyesight]] worsened throughout his mathematical career. In 1738, three years after nearly expiring from fever, he became almost blind in his right eye, but Euler rather blamed the painstaking work on [[cartography]] he performed for the St. Petersburg Academy for his condition. Euler's vision in that eye worsened throughout his stay in Germany, to the extent that Frederick referred to him as "[[Cyclops]]". Euler remarked on his loss of vision, "Now I will have fewer distractions."&lt;ref name="Richeson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=David S. Richeson|title=Euler's Gem: The Polyhedron Formula and the Birth of Topology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUYLhOVkaV4C&amp;pg=PA17|year=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1400838561|page=17}} Quoted from {{cite book|author=Howard W. Eves|title=In Mathematical Circles: A Selection of Mathematical Stories and Anecdotes|year=1969|publisher=Prindle, Weber, &amp; Schmidt|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later developed a [[cataract]] in his left eye, which was discovered in 1766. Just a few weeks after its discovery, he was rendered almost totally blind. However, his condition appeared to have little effect on his productivity, as he compensated for it with his mental calculation skills and exceptional memory. For example, Euler could repeat the ''[[Aeneid]]'' of [[Virgil]] from beginning to end without hesitation, and for every page in the edition he could indicate which line was the first and which the last. With the aid of his scribes, Euler's productivity on many areas of study actually increased. He produced, on average, one mathematical paper every week in the year 1775.&lt;ref name="volumes"/&gt; The Eulers bore a double name, Euler-Schölpi, the latter of which derives from ''schelb'' and ''schief'', signifying squint-eyed, cross-eyed, or crooked. This suggests that the Eulers may have had a susceptibility to eye problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Calinger |first=Ronald |date=2016 |title=Leonhard Euler mathematical genius in the Enlightenment |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10531.html |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=8 |isbn=978-1400866632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Russia and death===
In 1760, with the [[Seven Years' War]] raging, Euler's farm in Charlottenburg was ransacked by advancing Russian troops. Upon learning of this event, [[Ivan Saltykov|General Ivan Petrovich Saltykov]] paid compensation for the damage caused to Euler's estate, later [[Empress Elizabeth|Empress Elizabeth of Russia]] added a further payment of 4000 roubles—an exorbitant amount at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Gindikin, S.G., Гиндикин С. Г., МЦНМО, НМУ, 2001, с. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; The political situation in Russia stabilized after [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great's]] accession to the throne, so in 1766 Euler accepted an invitation to return to the St. Petersburg Academy. His conditions were quite exorbitant—a 3000 ruble annual salary, a pension for his wife, and the promise of high-ranking appointments for his sons. All of these requests were granted. He spent the rest of his life in Russia. However, his second stay in the country was marred by tragedy. A fire in St. Petersburg in 1771 cost him his home, and almost his life. In 1773, he lost his wife Katharina after 40 years of marriage.

Three years after his wife's death, Euler married her half-sister, Salome Abigail Gsell (1723–1794).&lt;ref name=gekker2/&gt; This marriage lasted until his death. In 1782 he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS/&gt;

In St. Petersburg on 18 September 1783, after a lunch with his family, Euler was discussing the newly discovered planet [[Uranus]] and its [[orbit]] with a fellow [[academician]] [[Anders Johan Lexell]], when he collapsed from a [[brain hemorrhage]]. He died a few hours later.&lt;ref name="euler"/&gt; [[:de:Jacob von Staehlin|Jacob von Staehlin-Storcksburg]] wrote a short obituary for the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and Russian mathematician [[Nicolas Fuss]], one of Euler's disciples, wrote a more detailed eulogy,&lt;ref name=novaacta/&gt; which he delivered at a memorial meeting. In his eulogy for the French Academy, French mathematician and philosopher [[Marquis de Condorcet]], wrote:

{{quote|''il cessa de calculer et de vivre''— ... he ceased to calculate and to live.&lt;ref name=condorcet/&gt;}}

Euler was buried next to Katharina at the [[Smolensk Lutheran Cemetery]] on [[Goloday Island]]. In 1785, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] put a marble bust of Leonhard Euler on a pedestal next to the Director's seat and, in 1837, placed a headstone on Euler's grave. To commemorate the 250th anniversary of Euler's birth, the headstone was moved in 1956, together with his remains, to the 18th-century necropolis at the [[Alexander Nevsky Lavra|Alexander Nevsky Monastery]].

==Contributions to mathematics and physics==
{{E (mathematical constant)}}

Euler worked in almost all areas of mathematics, such as [[geometry]], [[infinitesimal]] [[calculus]], [[trigonometry]], [[algebra]], and [[number theory]], as well as [[continuum physics]], [[lunar theory]] and other areas of [[physics]]. He is a seminal figure in the history of mathematics; if printed, his works, many of which are of fundamental interest, would occupy between 60 and 80 [[quarto (text)|quarto]] volumes.&lt;ref name="volumes"/&gt; Euler's name is associated with a [[List of topics named after Leonhard Euler|large number of topics]].

Euler is the only mathematician to have ''two'' numbers named after him: the important [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]] in [[calculus]], ''e'', approximately equal to 2.71828, and the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]] γ ([[gamma]]) sometimes referred to as just "Euler's constant", approximately equal to 0.57721. It is not known whether γ is [[Rational number|rational]] or [[Irrational number|irrational]].&lt;ref name=derbysh/&gt;
&lt;!-- The biography could use more correlation with his mathematical activities. When was his most prolific period and discoveries, and how did they fit in with his general life? --&gt;

===Mathematical notation===
Euler introduced and popularized several notational conventions through his numerous and widely circulated textbooks. Most notably, he introduced the concept of a [[function (mathematics)|function]]&lt;ref name="function"/&gt; and was the first to write ''f''(''x'') to denote the function ''f'' applied to the argument ''x''. He also introduced the modern notation for the [[trigonometric functions]], the letter {{math|''e''}} for the base of the [[natural logarithm]] (now also known as [[Euler's number]]), the Greek letter [[Sigma|Σ]] for summations and the letter {{math|''i''}} to denote the [[imaginary unit]].&lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt; The use of the Greek letter ''[[pi (letter)|π]]'' to denote the [[pi|ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter]] was also popularized by Euler, although it originated with [[Welsh people|Welsh]] mathematician [[William Jones (mathematician)|William Jones]].&lt;ref name="pi"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenwolfram.com/publications/mathematical-notation-past-future/| title = Mathematical Notation: Past and Future| accessdate=23 September 2014| last = Wolfram| first = Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===
The development of [[infinitesimal calculus]] was at the forefront of 18th-century mathematical research, and the [[Bernoulli family|Bernoullis]]—family friends of Euler—were responsible for much of the early progress in the field. Thanks to their influence, studying calculus became the major focus of Euler's work. While some of Euler's proofs are not acceptable by modern standards of [[mathematical rigor|mathematical rigour]]&lt;ref name = "Basel"/&gt; (in particular his reliance on the principle of the [[generality of algebra]]), his ideas led to many great advances.
Euler is well known in [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] for his frequent use and development of [[power series]], the expression of functions as sums of infinitely many terms, such as

:&lt;math&gt;e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {x^n \over n!} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(\frac{1}{0!} + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \cdots + \frac{x^n}{n!}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Notably, Euler directly proved the power series expansions for {{math|''e''}} and the [[inverse tangent]] function. (Indirect proof via the inverse power series technique was given by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] between 1670 and 1680.) His daring use of power series enabled him to solve the famous [[Basel problem]] in 1735 (he provided a more elaborate argument in 1741):&lt;ref name="Basel"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty {1 \over n^2} = \lim_{n \to \infty}\left(\frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n^2}\right) = \frac{\pi ^2}{6}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Euler's formula.svg|thumb|A geometric interpretation of [[Euler's formula]]]]

Euler introduced the use of the [[exponential function]] and [[logarithms]] in analytic proofs. He discovered ways to express various logarithmic functions using power series, and he successfully defined logarithms for negative and [[complex number]]s, thus greatly expanding the scope of mathematical applications of logarithms.&lt;ref name=Boyer/&gt; He also defined the exponential function for complex numbers, and discovered its relation to the [[trigonometric function]]s. For any [[real number]] [[φ|{{math|φ}}]] (taken to be radians), [[Euler's formula]] states that the [[Exponential function#On the complex plane|complex exponential]] function satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i\varphi} = \cos \varphi + i\sin \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

A special case of the above formula is known as [[Euler's identity]],
:&lt;math&gt;e^{i \pi} +1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
called "the most remarkable formula in mathematics" by [[Richard P. Feynman]], for its single uses of the notions of addition, multiplication, exponentiation, and equality, and the single uses of the important constants 0, 1, {{math|''e''}}, {{math|''i''}} and {{pi}}.&lt;ref name="Feynman"/&gt; In 1988, readers of the ''[[Mathematical Intelligencer]]'' voted it "the Most Beautiful Mathematical Formula Ever".&lt;ref name=MathInt/&gt; In total, Euler was responsible for three of the top five formulae in that poll.&lt;ref name=MathInt/&gt;

[[De Moivre's formula]] is a direct consequence of [[Euler's formula]].

In addition, Euler elaborated the theory of higher [[transcendental function]]s by introducing the [[gamma function]] and introduced a new method for solving [[quartic equation]]s. He also found a way to calculate integrals with complex limits, foreshadowing the development of modern [[complex analysis]]. He also invented the [[calculus of variations]] including its best-known result, the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]].

Euler also pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, [[analytic number theory]]. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of [[Generalized hypergeometric series|hypergeometric series]], [[q-series]], [[hyperbolic functions|hyperbolic trigonometric functions]] and the analytic theory of [[generalized continued fraction|continued fractions]]. For example, he proved the [[infinitude of primes]] using the divergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way [[prime numbers]] are distributed. Euler's work in this area led to the development of the [[prime number theorem]].&lt;ref name="analysis"/&gt;

===Number theory===
Euler's interest in number theory can be traced to the influence of [[Christian Goldbach]], his friend in the St. Petersburg Academy. A lot of Euler's early work on number theory was based on the works of [[Pierre de Fermat]]. Euler developed some of Fermat's ideas and disproved some of his conjectures.

Euler linked the nature of prime distribution with ideas in analysis. He proved that [[Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges|the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges]]. In doing so, he discovered the connection between the [[Riemann zeta function]] and the prime numbers; this is known as the [[Proof of the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function|Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function]].

Euler proved [[Newton's identities]], [[Fermat's little theorem]], [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]], and he made distinct contributions to [[Lagrange's four-square theorem]]. He also invented the [[totient function]] φ(''n''), the number of positive integers less than or equal to the integer ''n'' that are [[coprime]] to ''n''. Using properties of this function, he generalized Fermat's little theorem to what is now known as [[Euler's theorem]]. He contributed significantly to the theory of [[perfect number]]s, which had fascinated mathematicians since [[Euclid]]. He proved that the relationship shown between even perfect numbers and [[Mersenne prime]]s earlier proved by Euclid was one-to-one, a result otherwise known as the [[Euclid–Euler theorem]]. Euler also conjectured the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]]. The concept is regarded as a fundamental theorem of number theory, and his ideas paved the way for the work of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].&lt;ref name="numbertheory"/&gt;
By 1772 Euler had proved that 2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 = [[2147483647|2,147,483,647]] is a Mersenne prime. It may have remained the [[largest known prime]] until 1867.&lt;ref name=caldwell/&gt;

===Graph theory===
[[Image:Konigsberg bridges.png|frame|right|Map of [[Königsberg]] in Euler's time showing the actual layout of the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg|seven bridges]], highlighting the river Pregel and the bridges.]]
In 1735, Euler presented a solution to the problem known as the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]].&lt;ref name="bridge"/&gt; The city of [[Königsberg]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was set on the [[Pregel]] River, and included two large islands that were connected to each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no [[Eulerian path|Eulerian circuit]]. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of [[graph theory]], specifically of [[planar graph]] theory.&lt;ref name="bridge"/&gt;

Euler also discovered the [[Planar graph#Euler's formula|formula]] &lt;math&gt;V - E + F = 2&lt;/math&gt; relating the number of vertices, edges and faces of a [[Convex polytope|convex polyhedron]],&lt;ref name=cromw/&gt; and hence of a [[planar graph]]. The constant in this formula is now known as the [[Euler characteristic]] for the graph (or other mathematical object), and is related to the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] of the object.&lt;ref name=gibbons/&gt; The study and generalization of this formula, specifically by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]&lt;ref name="Cauchy"/&gt; and [[Simon Antoine Jean L'Huilier|L'Huilier]],&lt;ref name="Lhuillier"/&gt; is at the origin of [[topology]].

===Applied mathematics===
Some of Euler's greatest successes were in solving real-world problems analytically, and in describing numerous applications of the [[Bernoulli numbers]], [[Fourier series]], [[Euler number]]s, the constants [[E (mathematical constant)|{{math|e}}]] and [[pi|{{pi}}]], continued fractions and integrals. He integrated [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[differential calculus]] with Newton's [[Method of Fluxions]], and developed tools that made it easier to apply calculus to physical problems. He made great strides in improving the [[numerical approximation]] of integrals, inventing what are now known as the [[Euler approximations]]. The most notable of these approximations are [[Euler's method]] and the [[Euler–Maclaurin formula]]. He also facilitated the use of [[differential equations]], in particular introducing the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty } \left( 1+ \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n} - \ln(n) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

One of Euler's more unusual interests was the application of mathematical ideas in music. In 1739 he wrote the ''Tentamen novae theoriae musicae,'' hoping to eventually incorporate [[musical theory]] as part of mathematics. This part of his work, however, did not receive wide attention and was once described as too mathematical for musicians and too musical for mathematicians.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

Euler helped develop the [[Euler–Bernoulli beam equation]], which became a cornerstone of engineering. Aside from successfully applying his analytic tools to problems in [[classical mechanics]], Euler also applied these techniques to celestial problems. His work in astronomy was recognized by a number of Paris Academy Prizes over the course of his career. His accomplishments include determining with great accuracy the orbits of comets and other celestial bodies, understanding the nature of comets, and calculating the [[solar parallax|parallax]] of the sun. His calculations also contributed to the development of accurate [[History of longitude|longitude tables]].&lt;ref name=yousch/&gt;

In addition, Euler made important contributions in [[optics]]. He disagreed with Newton's [[corpuscular theory of light]] in the ''[[Opticks]]'', which was then the prevailing theory. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the [[wave theory of light]] proposed by [[Christiaan Huygens]] would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the [[wave-particle duality|quantum theory of light]].&lt;ref name="optics"/&gt;

In 1757 he published an important set of equations for [[inviscid flow]], that are now known as the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].&lt;ref name=euler2/&gt; In differential form, the equations are:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;{\partial\rho\over\partial t}+
\nabla\cdot(\rho\mathbf u)=0\\[1.2ex]
&amp;{\partial(\rho{\mathbf u})\over\partial t}+
\nabla\cdot(\mathbf u\otimes(\rho \mathbf u))+\nabla p=\mathbf{0}\\[1.2ex]
&amp;{\partial E\over\partial t}+
\nabla\cdot(\mathbf u(E+p))=0,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* ''ρ'' is the fluid [[mass density]],
* '''''u''''' is the fluid [[velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], with components ''u'', ''v'', and ''w'',
* ''E'' = ''ρ e'' + ½ ''ρ'' (''u''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''w''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is the total energy per unit [[volume]], with ''e'' being the [[internal energy]] per unit mass for the fluid,
* ''p'' is the [[pressure]],
* ''⊗'' denotes the [[tensor product]], and
* '''0''' being the [[zero vector]].

Euler is also well known in structural engineering for his formula giving the critical [[buckling]] load of an ideal strut, which depends only on its length and flexural stiffness:&lt;ref name="SIAM"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;F=\frac{\pi^2 EI}{(KL)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* ''F'' = maximum or critical [[force]] (vertical load on column),
* ''E'' = [[modulus of elasticity]],
* ''I'' = [[area moment of inertia]],
* ''L'' = unsupported length of column,
* ''K'' = column effective length factor, whose value depends on the conditions of end support of the column, as follows.
::For both ends pinned (hinged, free to rotate), ''K'' = 1.0.
::For both ends fixed, ''K'' = 0.50.
::For one end fixed and the other end pinned, ''K'' = 0.699…
::For one end fixed and the other end free to move laterally, ''K'' = 2.0.
* ''K L'' is the effective length of the column.

===Logic===
Euler is also credited with using [[closed curve]]s to illustrate [[syllogism|syllogistic]] reasoning (1768). These diagrams have become known as [[Euler diagram]]s.&lt;ref name="logic"/&gt;
[[File:Euler Diagram.svg|thumb|169x169px|Euler's diagram]]

An Euler diagram is a [[diagram]]matic means of representing [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and their relationships. Euler diagrams consist of simple closed curves (usually circles) in the plane that depict [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].  Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or "zones": the interior, which symbolically represents the [[element (mathematics)|elements]] of the set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set.  The sizes or shapes of the curves are not important; the significance of the diagram is in how they overlap. The spatial relationships between the regions bounded by each curve (overlap, containment or neither) corresponds to set-theoretic relationships ([[intersection (set theory)|intersection]], [[subset]] and [[Disjoint sets|disjointness]]).   Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent [[disjoint sets]].  Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of the sets).  A curve that is contained completely within the interior zone of another represents a [[subset]] of it. Euler diagrams (and their generalization in [[Venn diagram]]s) were incorporated as part of instruction in [[set theory]] as part of the [[new math]] movement in the 1960s. Since then, they have also been adopted by other curriculum fields such as reading.&lt;ref name=quest/&gt;

===Music===
Even when dealing with music, Euler's approach is mainly mathematical. His writings on music are not particularly numerous (a few hundred pages, in his total production of about thirty thousand pages), but they reflect an early preoccupation and one that did not leave him throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Pesic, ''Music and the Making of Modern Science'', p.&amp;nbsp;133.&lt;/ref&gt;

A first point of Euler's musical theory is the definition of "genres", i.e. of possible divisions of the octave using the prime numbers 3 and 5. Euler describes 18 such genres, with the general definition 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;A, where A is the "exponent" of the genre (i.e. the sum of the exponents of 3 and 5) and 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; (where "m is an indefinite number, small or large, so long as the sounds are perceptible"&lt;ref&gt;Leonhard Euler, ''Tentamen novae theoriae musicae'', St Petersburg, 1739, p.&amp;nbsp;115&lt;/ref&gt;), expresses that the relation holds independently of the number of octaves concerned. The first genre, with A = 1, is the octave itself (or its duplicates); the second genre, 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;.3, is the octave divided by the fifth (fifth + fourth, C–G–C); the third genre is 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;.5, major third + minor sixth (C–E–C); the fourth is 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;.3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, two fourths and a tone (C–F–B{{music|b}}–C); the fifth is 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;.3.5 (C–E–G–B–C); etc. Genres 12 (2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;.3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.5), 13 (2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;.3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 14 (2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;.3.5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) are corrected versions of the diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic, respectively, of the Ancients. Genre 18 (2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;.3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is the "diatonico-chromatic", "used generally in all compositions",&lt;ref&gt;Eric Emery, ''Temps et musique'',  Lausanne, L'Âge d'homme, 2000, pp. 344–45.&lt;/ref&gt; and which turns out to be identical with the system described by Johann Mattheson.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Mattheson, ''Grosse General-Baß-Schule'', Hamburg, 1731, Vol. I, pp.&amp;nbsp;104–06, mentioned by Euler; and ''Exemplarische Organisten-Probe'', Hamburg, 1719, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Euler later envisaged the possibility of describing genres including the prime number 7.&lt;ref&gt;Wilfrid Perret, ''Some Questions of Musical Theory'', Cambridge, 1926, pp.&amp;nbsp;60–62; "What is an Euler-Fokker genus?", http://www.huygens-fokker.org/microtonality/efg.html, retrieved 12-6-2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euler devised a specific graph, the ''Speculum musicum'',&lt;ref&gt;Leonhard Euler,''Tentamen novae theoriae musicae'', St Petersburg, 1739, p.&amp;nbsp;147; ''De harmoniae veris principiis'', St Petersburg, 1774, p.&amp;nbsp;350.&lt;/ref&gt; to illustrate the diatonico-chromatic genre, and discussed paths in this graph for specific intervals, recalling his interest in the Seven Bridges of Königsberg (see [[Leonhard Euler#Graph theory|above]]). The device drew renewed interest as the [[Tonnetz]] in neo-Riemannian theory (see also [[Lattice (music)]]).&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gollin, "Combinatorial and Transformational Aspects of Euler's ''Speculum Musicum''", ''Mathematics and Computation in Music'', T. Klouche and Th. Noll eds, Springer, 2009, pp. 406–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euler further used the principle of the "exponent" to propose a derivation of the ''gradus suavitatis'' (degree of suavity, of agreeableness) of intervals and chords from their prime factors – one must keep in mind that he considered just intonation, i.e. 1 and the prime numbers 3 and 5 only.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Lindley and Ronald Turner-Smith, ''Mathematical Models of Musical Scales'', Bonn, Verlag für systematische Musikwissenschaft, 1993, pp. 234–39. See also Catherine Nolan, "Music Theory and Mathematics", ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory'', Th. Christensen ed., New York, CUP, 2002, pp. 278–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Formulas have been proposed extending this system to any number of prime numbers, e.g. in the form

:''ds'' = {{SIGMA}} ''(k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)'' + 1

where ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are prime numbers and ''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' their exponents.&lt;ref&gt;Patrice Bailhache, "La Musique traduite en Mathématiques: Leonhard Euler", http://patrice.bailhache.free.fr/thmusique/euler.html, retrieved 12-6-2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal philosophy and religious beliefs==
Euler and his friend [[Daniel Bernoulli]] were opponents of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz's]] [[monadism]] and the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. Euler insisted that knowledge is founded in part on the basis of precise quantitative laws, something that monadism and Wolffian science were unable to provide. Euler's religious leanings might also have had a bearing on his dislike of the doctrine; he went so far as to label Wolff's ideas as "heathen and atheistic".&lt;ref name="wolff"/&gt;

Much of what is known of Euler's religious beliefs can be deduced from his ''Letters to a German Princess'' and an earlier work, ''Rettung der Göttlichen Offenbahrung Gegen die Einwürfe der Freygeister'' (''Defense of the Divine Revelation against the Objections of the Freethinkers''). These works show that Euler was a devout Christian who believed the Bible to be inspired; the ''Rettung'' was primarily an argument for the [[Biblical inspiration|divine inspiration of scripture]].&lt;ref name="theology"/&gt;

There is a famous legend&lt;ref name="diderot"/&gt; inspired by Euler's arguments with secular philosophers over religion, which is set during Euler's second stint at the St. Petersburg Academy. The French philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] was visiting Russia on Catherine the Great's invitation. However, the Empress was alarmed that the philosopher's arguments for [[atheism]] were influencing members of her court, and so Euler was asked to confront the Frenchman. Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician had produced a proof of the [[existence of God]]: he agreed to view the proof as it was presented in court. Euler appeared, advanced toward Diderot, and in a tone of perfect conviction announced this [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]]: "Sir, {{sfrac|''a+b&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''|''n''}}=''x'', hence God exists—reply!"
Diderot, to whom (says the story) all mathematics was gibberish, stood dumbstruck as peals of laughter erupted from the court.  Embarrassed, he asked to leave Russia, a request that was graciously granted by the Empress. However amusing the anecdote may be, it is [[wikt:apocryphal|apocryphal]], given that Diderot himself did research in mathematics.&lt;ref name=persee/&gt;
The legend was apparently first told by
[[Dieudonné Thiébault]]&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt; with significant embellishment by [[Augustus De Morgan]].&lt;ref name="Struik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gillings"/&gt;

==Commemorations==
[[Image:Euler-10 Swiss Franc banknote (front).jpg|thumb|Euler on the Old Swiss [[Swiss Franc|10 Franc]] banknote]]
Euler was featured on the sixth series of the Swiss 10-[[Swiss franc|franc]] banknote and on numerous Swiss, German, and Russian postage stamps. The [[asteroid]] [[2002 Euler]] was named in his honor. He is also commemorated by the [[Lutheran Church]] on their [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] on 24 May—he was a devout Christian (and believer in [[biblical inerrancy]]) who wrote [[apologetics]] and argued forcefully against the prominent atheists of his time.&lt;ref name="theology"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45975">In [[mathematics]], the [[classification of finite simple groups]] states that every [[Finite group|finite]] [[simple group]] is [[cyclic group|cyclic]], or [[alternating group|alternating]], or in one of 16 families of [[groups of Lie type]], or one of 26 [[sporadic group]]s.

The list below gives all finite simple groups, together with their [[order (group theory)|order]], the size of the [[Schur multiplier]], the size of the [[outer automorphism group]], usually some small [[group representation|representations]], and lists of all duplicates.

== Summary ==

The following table is a complete list of the 18 families of finite simple groups and the 26 sporadic simple groups, along with their orders. Any non-simple members of each family are listed, as well as any members duplicated within a family or between families. (In removing duplicates it is useful to note that no two finite simple groups have the same order, except that the group A&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(2) and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(4) both have order 20160, and that the group ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''q'') has the same order as  ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''q'') for ''q'' odd, ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2. The smallest of the latter pairs of groups are ''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(3) and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(3) which both have order 4585351680.)

There is an unfortunate conflict between the notations for the alternating groups A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and the groups of Lie type ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''q'').  Some authors use various different fonts for A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to distinguish them.  In particular,
in this article we make the distinction by setting the alternating groups A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in Roman font and the Lie-type groups ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''q'') in italic.

In what follows, ''n'' is a positive integer, and ''q'' is a positive power of a prime number ''p'', with the restrictions noted. The notation (''a'',''b'') represents the greatest common divisor of the integers ''a'' and ''b''.

==[[Cyclic group]]s, Z&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;==
'''Simplicity:''' Simple for ''p'' a prime number.

'''Order:''' ''p''

'''Schur multiplier:''' Trivial.

'''Outer automorphism group:''' Cyclic of order ''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1.

'''Other names:''' Z/''p''Z

'''Remarks:''' These are the only simple groups that are not [[perfect group|perfect]].

==[[Alternating group]]s, A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n'' &gt; 4==
&lt;!-- Note that this page uses italic for group of Lie type A, but Roman for the alternating groups.--&gt;

'''Simplicity:''' Solvable for ''n'' &lt; 5, otherwise simple.

'''Order:''' ''n''!/2  when ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

'''Schur multiplier:''' 2 for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 or ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;7, 6 for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 or 7; see ''[[Covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups]]''

'''Outer automorphism group:''' In general 2.  Exceptions: for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, it is trivial, and for [[outer automorphism group#The outer automorphisms of the symmetric groups|''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6]], it has order 4 (elementary abelian).

'''Other names:''' Alt&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Isomorphisms:''' A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are trivial. A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is cyclic of order 3. A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(3) (solvable).  A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(4) and to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(5). A&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(9) and to the derived group ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2)′. A&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(2).

'''Remarks:''' An [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2 subgroup of the [[symmetric group]] of permutations of ''n'' points when ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

== Groups of Lie type ==

'''Notation:''' ''n'' is a positive integer,  ''q'' &gt; 1 is a power of a prime number ''p'', and is the order of some underlying [[finite field]]. The order of the outer automorphism group is written as  ''d''⋅''f''⋅''g'', where ''d'' is the order of the group of "diagonal automorphisms", ''f'' is the order of the (cyclic) group of "field automorphisms" (generated by a [[Frobenius automorphism]]), and ''g'' is the order of the group of "graph automorphisms" (coming from automorphisms of the [[Dynkin diagram]]). The notation (''a'',''b'') represents the greatest common divisor of the integers ''a'' and ''b''.

'''Louis Necker''', called '''de Germany''' (31 August 1730 in Geneva – 31 July 1804 in [[Cologny]]) was a [[Republic and Canton of Geneva#History|Genevan]] mathematician, physicist, professor and a banker in Paris. He was the elder brother of [[Jacques Necker]], minister of Finance in France when the French Revolution broke out. 

== Biography ==

Louis Necker studied mathematics and physics at the [[Academy of Geneva]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rde_0769-0886_1990_num_8_1_1057 Frank A.

For a while he became the governor of probably [[Charles Christian, Prince of Nassau-Weilburg]] and [[Simon August, Count of Lippe-Detmold]] during their stay in Geneva and traveled with them to the University of Turin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=FZY1SmV_ArYC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Lippe-Detmold+Louis+Necker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6aS7uVCvIY&amp;sig=xmya3pBcWBX5AqCyLAsGYP-NljM&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPz8eusc_eAhUKMewKHUdUDVAQ6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lippe-Detmold%20Louis%20Necker&amp;f=false Madame de Staël: Her Friends, and Her Influence in Politics and Literature by Charlotte Blennerhassett, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=-VsmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21&amp;lpg=PT21&amp;dq=Lippe-Detmold+Louis+Necker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D2n7sLENgy&amp;sig=i1VNYDnwhun_Rlz8e6TzU6zQ74g&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPz8eusc_eAhUKMewKHUdUDVAQ6AEwBHoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Louis%20Necker&amp;f=false Necker by Ghislain de DIESBACH]&lt;/ref&gt; He managed a boarding school for young English held by his father Charles Frederick, lawyer and professor of law at the Geneva Academy. He was appointed as the [[hofmeister (office)|hofmeister]] of a Baron van [[Van Wassenaer]] and a [[Bentinck]]. 

In 1752 he purchased {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean Jallabert|fr}}'s physics laboratory and in 1757 acceded the chair of mathematics and the honorary chair of Experimental Physics of the Academy of Geneva. As a correspondent of the [[Académie royale des sciences]] he had written an article for the Encyclopedia on [[Friction]] in mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/kafker/navigate/1/98/ The Encyclopedists as individuals: a biographical dictionary of the authors of the Encyclopédie]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1759 he lost his wife Isabelle André, whom he had married in 1752 and came from Marseille. In 1761 he was forced to resign from his professorship after a scandal (Vernes-Necker case).&lt;ref&gt;https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/kafker/navigate/1/98/&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 1762 with the help of his brother he was appointed in a trading house in Marseille and added to his last name de Germany, after the family estate near [[Rolle]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=FZY1SmV_ArYC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=Lippe-Detmold+Louis+Necker&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6aS7uVCvIY&amp;sig=xmya3pBcWBX5AqCyLAsGYP-NljM&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiPz8eusc_eAhUKMewKHUdUDVAQ6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lippe-Detmold%20Louis%20Necker&amp;f=false Madame de Staël: Her Friends, and Her Influence in Politics and Literature by Charlotte Blennerhassett, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; He was dropped from the Académie des sciences's list of Corresponding Members in 1767.

In 1770 he moved to Paris. In 1772 he became a banker at {{Interlanguage link multi|Banque Girardot|fr|3=Banque Girardot|lt=Girardot Bank}}. In 1773 he remarried. Between 1774 and 1778 he must have been very busy collecting interest for his rich and noble clients in [[Utrecht]], the Netherlands. An astonishing number of notarial deeds are on his name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hetutrechtsarchief.nl/onderzoek/resultaten/archieven/zoekresultaat?mistart=68&amp;mivast=39&amp;mizig=236&amp;miadt=39&amp;miaet=54&amp;micode=34-4.U256c014&amp;milang=nl&amp;misort=last_mod%7Cdesc&amp;miview=ldt&amp;mizk_alle=Louis%20Necker&amp;mibj=1750&amp;miej=1800 Utrecht Archief]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776 he became [[resident (title)|resident]] for the [[Republic of Geneva]], succeeding his brother. When Emmanuel Haller was appointed in the Girardot bank in 1777, Louis became a silent partner. At some time (1777?) he became a friend of [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-24-02-0314]&lt;/ref&gt; Jacques Necker was dismissed on 19 May 1781 as controller of the royal treasury.

As a result of changes during the liberal phase of the [[French Revolution]], he thought it prudent to return to his homeland in 1791. The disgrace of his younger brother Jacques, who resigned in 1790, contributed to his decision. The Neckers were far from welcome in Geneva. Many of the French émigrés considered them Jacobins, and many of the Swiss Jacobins thought them conservative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/kafker/navigate/1/98/ The Encyclopedists as individuals: a biographical dictionary of the authors of the Encyclopédie]&lt;/ref&gt;

His son Jacques (1757-1825), who had joined the French army, married [[Albertine Necker de Saussure]] in 1785. The French Revolution ended his military career. In 1790, he began teaching as a demonstrator in botany at the [[Academy of Geneva]] as Professor of Botany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1257">In [[mathematics]], a function ''f'' on the interval [''a'', ''b''] has the '''Luzin N property''', named after [[Nikolai Luzin]] (also called Luzin property or N property) if for all &lt;math&gt;N\subset[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda(N)=0&lt;/math&gt;, there holds: &lt;math&gt;\lambda(f(N))=0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; stands for the [[Lebesgue measure]].

Note that the image of such a set ''N'' is not necessarily [[measurable set|measurable]], but since the Lebesgue measure is [[Complete measure|complete]], it follows that if the Lebesgue [[outer measure]] of that set is zero, then it is measurable and its Lebesgue measure is zero as well.

==Properties==
Every [[absolutely continuous]] function has the Luzin N property. The [[Cantor function]] on the other hand does not: the Lebesgue measure of the [[Cantor set]] is zero, however its image is the complete [0,1] interval.

Also, if a function ''f'' on the interval [''a'',''b''] is [[continuous function|continuous]], is of [[bounded variation]] and has the Luzin N property, then it is [[absolutely continuous]].

In [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, a '''map graph''' is an [[undirected graph]] formed as the [[intersection graph]] of finitely many simply connected and internally disjoint regions of the [[Euclidean plane]]. The map graphs include the [[planar graph]]s, but are more general. Any number of regions can meet at a common corner (as in the [[Four Corners]] of the United States, where four states meet), and when they do the map graph will contain a [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] connecting the corresponding vertices, unlike planar graphs in which the largest cliques have only four vertices.&lt;ref name="cgp"&gt;{{citation

==Combinatorial representation==
Map graphs can be represented combinatorially as the "half-squares of planar bipartite graphs". That is, let {{math|''G'' {{=}} (''U'',''V'',''E'')}} be a planar [[bipartite graph]], with bipartition {{math|(''U'',''V'')}}. The [[Graph power|square]] of {{mvar|G}} is another graph on the same vertex set, in which two vertices are adjacent in the square when they are at most two steps apart in {{mvar|G}}. The half-square or [[bipartite half]] is the [[induced subgraph]] of one side of the bipartition (say {{mvar|V}}) in the square graph: its vertex set is {{mvar|V}} and it has an edge between each two vertices in {{mvar|V}} that are two steps apart in {{mvar|G}}. The half-square is a map graph. It can be represented geometrically by finding a [[graph drawing|planar embedding]] of {{mvar|G}}, and expanding each vertex of {{mvar|V}} and its adjacent edges into a star-shaped region, so that these regions touch at the vertices of {{mvar|U}}. Conversely, every map graph can be represented as a half-square in this way.&lt;ref name="cgp"/&gt;

==Computational complexity==
Map graphs can be recognized in [[polynomial time]]. However, the high exponent of the known polynomial time algorithm for this problem makes it impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Variations and related concepts==
A {{mvar|k}}-map graph is a map graph derived from a set of regions in which at most {{mvar|k}} regions meet at any point. Equivalently, it is the half-square of a planar bipartite graph in which the vertex set {{mvar|U}} (the side of the bipartition not used to induce the half-square) has maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] {{mvar|k}}. A 3-map graph is a [[planar graph]], and every planar graph can be represented as a 3-map graph. Every 4-map graph is a [[1-planar graph]], a graph that can be drawn with at most one crossing per edge, and every optimal 1-planar graph (a graph formed from a planar quadrangulation by adding two crossing diagonals to every quadrilateral face) is a 4-map graph. However, some other 1-planar graphs are not map graphs, because (unlike map graphs) they include crossing edges that are not part of a four-vertex complete subgraph.&lt;ref name="cgp"/&gt;

The '''Mayan numeral system''' was the system to represent numbers and calendar dates in the [[Maya civilization]]. It was a [[vigesimal]] (base-20) [[positional notation|positional]]  [[numeral system]]. The numerals are made up of three symbols; [[Zero number#The Americas|zero]] ([[Turtle shell|shell]] shape, with the [[Turtle shell#Plastron|plastron]] uppermost), [[1 (number)|one]] (a dot) and [[5 (number)|five]] (a bar).  For example, thirteen is written as three dots in a horizontal row above two horizontal bars; sometimes it is also written as three vertical dots to the left of two vertical bars.  With these three symbols each of the twenty vigesimal digits could be written.

Numbers after 19 were written vertically in powers of twenty. The Mayan used powers of twenty, just as our [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] uses powers of tens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saxakali.com/historymam2.htm|title=Maya Numerals|author=Saxakali|year=1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714025120/http://www.saxakali.com/historymam2.htm|archivedate=2006-07-14|accessdate=2006-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, thirty-three would be written as one dot, above three dots atop two bars. The first dot represents "one twenty" or "1×20", which is added to three dots and two bars, or thirteen. Therefore, (1×20) + 13 = 33. Upon reaching 20&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 400, another row is started (20&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or 8000, then 20&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; or 160,000, and so on). The number 429 would be written as one dot above one dot above four dots and a bar, or (1×20&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) + (1×20&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) + 9 = 429. 

Other than the bar and dot notation, Maya numerals were sometimes illustrated by face type glyphs or pictures. The face glyph for a number represents the deity associated with the number. These face number glyphs were rarely used, and are mostly seen on some of the most elaborate monumental carving.

__TOC__
== Addition and subtraction ==
Adding and subtracting numbers below 20 using Maya numerals is very simple.
[[Addition]] is performed by combining the numeric symbols at each level:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Maya add.png|210px]]

If five or more dots result from the combination, five dots are removed and replaced by a bar. If four or more bars result, four bars are removed and a dot is added to the next higher row.

Similarly with [[subtraction]], remove the elements of the [[subtrahend]] symbol from the [[minuend]] symbol:&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Mayan subtract.png|210px]]

If there are not enough dots in a minuend position, a bar is replaced by five dots. If there are not enough bars, a dot is removed from the next higher minuend symbol in the column and four bars are added to the minuend symbol which is being worked on.

== Modified vigesimal system in the Maya calendar ==
[[File:La Mojarra Estela 1 (Escritura superior).jpg|thumb|266x266px|Detail showing in the right columns glyphs from [[La Mojarra Stela 1]].  The left column uses Maya numerals to show a Long Count date of 8.5.16.9.7, or 156 CE.]]
The "Long Count" portion of the [[Maya calendar]] uses a variation on the strictly vigesimal numbering. In the second position, only the digits up to 17 are used, and the [[positional notation|place value]] of the third position is not 20×20 = 400, as would otherwise be expected, but 18×20 = 360, so that one dot over two zeros signifies 360.  Presumably, this is because 360 is roughly the number of days in a [[year]]. (The Maya had however a quite accurate estimation of 365.2422 days for the [[Solar Year|solar year]] at least since the early [[Maya civilization#Classic period|Classic era]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mayans | publisher=Lucent Books, Inc. | author=Kallen, Stuart A. | year=1955 | location=San Diego, CA | pages=56 | isbn=1-56006-757-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent positions use all twenty digits and the place values continue as 18×20×20 = 7,200 and 18×20×20×20 = 144,000, etc.

Every known example of large numbers in the Maya system uses this 'modified vigesimal' system, with the third position representing multiples of 18×20. It is reasonable to assume, but not proven by any evidence, that the normal system in use was a pure base-20 system.

== Origins ==
Several Mesoamerican cultures used similar numerals and base-twenty systems and the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]] requiring the use of zero as a place-holder. The earliest long count date (on [[Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2#Notable finds|Stela 2]] at Chiapa de Corzo, [[Chiapas]]) is from 36 BC.&lt;ref&gt;No long count date actually using the number 0 has been found before the 3rd century BC, but since the long count system would make no sense without some placeholder, and since Mesoamerican glyphs do not typically leave empty spaces, these earlier dates are taken as indirect evidence that the concept of 0 already existed at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the eight earliest Long Count dates appear outside the Maya homeland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Olmecs: America's First Civilization|last=Diehl|first=Richard|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2004|isbn=0-500-02119-8|location=London|page=186|oclc=56746987|authorlink=Richard Diehl}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is assumed that the use of zero and the Long Count calendar predated the Maya, and was possibly the invention of the [[Olmec]]. Indeed, many of the earliest Long Count dates were found within the Olmec heartland. However, the Olmec civilization had come to an end by the 4th century BC, several centuries before the earliest known Long Count dates—which suggests that zero was ''not'' an Olmec discovery.

In [[computer science]], a '''one-way function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to [[Inverse function|invert]] given the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of a random input.  Here, "easy" and "hard" are to be understood in the sense of [[computational complexity theory]], specifically the theory of [[polynomial time]] problems. Not being [[One-to-one function|one-to-one]] is not considered sufficient of a function for it to be called one-way (see Theoretical definition, below).

The existence of such one-way functions is still an open [[conjecture]].  In fact, their existence would prove that the [[complexity classes]] [[P = NP problem|P and NP are not equal]], thus resolving the foremost unsolved question of theoretical computer science.&lt;ref name=Goldreich&gt;[[Oded Goldreich]] (2001). Foundations of Cryptography: Volume 1, Basic Tools, ([http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PSBookFrag/part2N.ps draft available] from author's site). Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|0-521-79172-3}}. (see also [http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/foc-book.html wisdom.weizmann.ac.il])&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ex. 2.2, page 70}} The converse is not known to be true, i.e. the existence of a proof that P and NP are not equal would not directly imply the existence of one-way functions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shafi Goldwasser|Goldwasser, S.]] and Bellare, M. [http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/gb.html "Lecture Notes on Cryptography"]. Summer course on cryptography, MIT, 1996–2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In applied contexts, the terms "easy" and "hard" are usually interpreted relative to some specific computing entity; typically "cheap enough for the legitimate users" and "prohibitively expensive for any [[Black hat hacking|malicious agent]]s". One-way functions, in this sense, are fundamental tools for [[cryptography]], [[personal identification]], [[authentication]], and other [[data security]] applications.  While the existence of one-way functions in this sense is also an open conjecture, there are several candidates that have withstood decades of intense scrutiny.  Some of them are essential ingredients of most [[telecommunication]]s, [[e-commerce]], and [[Online banking|e-banking]] systems around the world.

==Theoretical definition==
A function ''f'' : {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; → {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is '''one-way''' if ''f'' can be computed by a polynomial time algorithm, but any polynomial time [[Probabilistic Turing machine|randomized algorithm]]  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;  that attempts to compute a pseudo-inverse for ''f'' succeeds with [[Negligible function|negligible]] probability.&lt;ref&gt;For the meaning of {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; see [[Kleene star]].&lt;/ref&gt;    That is, for all randomized algorithms  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; ,  all positive integers ''c'' and all sufficiently large  ''n'' = length(''x'') ,

: &lt;math&gt;\Pr[f(F(f(x))) = f(x)] &lt; n^{-c},&lt;/math&gt;

where the probability is over the choice of ''x'' from the [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|discrete uniform distribution]] on {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and the randomness of  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Many authors view this definition as strong one-way function.    Weak one-way function can be defined similarly except that the probability that every adversarial  &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;  fails to invert ''f'' is noticeable.    However, one may construct strong one-way functions based on weak ones. Loosely speaking, strong and weak versions of one-way function are equivalent theoretically. See Goldreich's Foundations of Cryptography, vol. 1, ch 2.1–2.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that,  by this definition, the function must be "hard to invert" in the [[best, worst and average case|average-case, rather than worst-case]] sense. This is different from much of complexity theory (e.g., [[NP-hard]]ness), where the term "hard" is meant in the worst-case. That is why even if some candidates for one-way functions (described below) are known to be [[NP-complete]], it does not imply their one-wayness. The latter property is only based on the lack of known algorithm to solve the problem.

It is not sufficient to make a function "lossy" (not one-to-one) to have a one-way function. In particular, the function that outputs the string of ''n'' zeros on any input of length ''n'' is ''not'' a one-way function because it is easy to come up with an input that will result in the same output. More precisely:  For such a function that simply outputs a string of zeroes, an algorithm ''F'' that just outputs any string of length ''n'' on input ''f''(''x'') will "find" a proper preimage of the output, even if it is not the input which was originally used to find the output string.

==Related concepts==
A '''one-way permutation''' is a one-way function that is also a permutation—that is, a one-way function that is [[Bijection|bijective]].  One-way permutations are an important [[cryptographic primitive]], and it is not known if their existence is implied by the existence of one-way functions.

A [[trapdoor one-way function]] or trapdoor permutation is a special kind of one-way function. Such a function is hard to invert unless some secret information, called the ''trapdoor'', is known.

A '''collision-free hash function''' ''f'' is a one-way function that is also ''collision-resistant''; that is, no [[randomized polynomial time]] algorithm can find a [[Collision (computer science)|collision]]—distinct values ''x'', ''y'' such that ''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y'')—with non-negligible probability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Russell |first=A. |title=Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Collision-Free Hashing |journal=[[Journal of Cryptology]] |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=87–99 |year=1995 |doi=10.1007/BF00190757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical implications of one-way functions==
If ''f'' is a one-way function, then the inversion of ''f'' would be a problem whose output is hard to compute (by definition) but easy to check (just by computing ''f'' on it).  Thus, the existence of a one-way function implies that [[FP (complexity)|FP]]≠[[FNP (complexity)|FNP]], which in turn implies that P≠NP.  However, it is not known whether P≠NP implies the existence of one-way functions.

The existence of a one-way function implies the existence of many other useful concepts, including:

*[[Pseudorandom generator]]s
*[[Pseudorandom function]] families
*[[commitment scheme|Bit commitment schemes]]
*Private-key encryption schemes secure against [[adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack]]
*[[Message authentication code]]s
*[[Digital signature scheme]]s (secure against adaptive chosen-message attack)

The existence of one-way functions also implies that there is no [[natural proof]] for P≠NP.

==Candidates for one-way functions==
The following are several candidates for one-way functions (as of April 2009). Clearly, it is not known whether
these functions are indeed one-way; but extensive research has so far failed to produce an efficient inverting algorithm for any of them.{{Citation needed|reason=No sources are listed|date=March 2018}}

===Multiplication and factoring===
The function ''f'' takes as inputs two prime numbers ''p'' and ''q'' in binary notation and returns their product.  This function can be "easily" computed in [[big O notation|''O''(''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)]] time, where ''b'' is the total number of bits of the inputs.  Inverting this function requires [[integer factorization|finding the factors]] of a given integer ''N''.  The best factoring algorithms known run in &lt;math&gt;O\left(\exp\sqrt[3]{\frac{64}{9} b (\log b)^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;time, where b is the number of bits needed to represent ''N''.

This function can be generalized by allowing ''p'' and ''q'' to range over a  suitable set of [[semiprimes]].  Note that ''f'' is not one-way for randomly selected integers ''p,q''&amp;gt;1, since the product will have 2 as a factor with probability 3/4 (because the probability that an arbitrary ''p'' is odd is 1/2, and likewise for ''q'', so if they're chosen independently, the probability that both are odd is therefore 1/4; hence the probability that p or q is even is 1 - 1/4 = 3/4).

===The Rabin function (modular squaring)===
The '''Rabin function''',&lt;ref name=Goldreich /&gt;{{rp|57}} or squaring [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] &lt;math&gt;N=pq&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are primes is believed to be a collection of one-way functions. We write
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Rabin}_N(x)\triangleq x^2\bmod N&lt;/math&gt;
to denote squaring modulo {{mvar|N}}: a specific member of the '''Rabin collection'''. It can be shown that extracting square roots, i.e. inverting the Rabin function, is computationally equivalent to factoring {{mvar|N}} (in the sense of [[polynomial-time reduction]]). Hence it can be proven that the Rabin collection is one-way if and only if factoring is hard. This also holds for the special case in which {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} are of the same bit length. The [[Rabin cryptosystem]] is based on the assumption that this [[Rabin one-way function|Rabin function]] is one-way.

===Discrete exponential and logarithm===
[[Modular exponentiation]] can be done in polynomial time. Inverting this function requires computing the [[discrete logarithm]]. Currently there are several popular groups for which no known algorithm to calculate the underlying discrete logarithm in polynomial time is known. These groups are all [[finite abelian group]]s and the general discrete logarithm problem can be described as thus.

Let ''G'' be a finite abelian group of [[cardinality]] ''n''. Denote its [[group operation]] by multiplication. Consider a [[Primitive element (finite field)|primitive element]] &amp;alpha; &amp;isin; ''G'' and another element &amp;beta; &amp;isin; ''G''. The discrete logarithm problem is to find the positive integer ''k'', where 1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ n, such that:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^k = \underbrace{\alpha \cdot \alpha \cdot \ldots \cdot \alpha}_{k \; \mathrm{times}} = \beta&lt;/math&gt;

The integer ''k'' that solves the equation {{nowrap|1=&amp;alpha;&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;beta;}} is termed the '''discrete logarithm''' of &amp;beta; to the base &amp;alpha;. One writes ''k'' = log&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;beta;.

Popular choices for the group ''G'' in discrete logarithm [[cryptography]] are the cyclic groups [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|('''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;]] (e.g. [[ElGamal encryption]], [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]], and the [[Digital Signature Algorithm]]) and cyclic subgroups of [[elliptic curve]]s over [[finite field]]s (''see'' [[elliptic curve cryptography]]).

An elliptic curve is a set of pairs of elements of a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] satisfying ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''ax'' + ''b''. The elements of the curve form a group under an operation called "point addition" (which is not the same as the addition operation of the field). Multiplication ''kP'' of a point ''P'' by an integer ''k'' (''i.e.'', a [[group action]] of the additive group of the integers) is defined as repeated addition of the point to itself. If ''k'' and ''P'' are known, it is easy to compute ''R'' = ''kP'', but if only ''R'' and ''P'' are known, it is assumed to be hard to compute ''k''.

===Cryptographically secure hash functions===
There are a number of [[cryptographic hash function]]s that are fast to compute, such as [[SHA 256]]. Some of the simpler versions have fallen to sophisticated analysis, but the strongest versions continue to offer fast, practical solutions for one-way computation. Most of the theoretical support for the functions are more techniques for thwarting some of the previously successful attacks.

===Other candidates===
Other candidates for one-way functions have been based on the hardness of the decoding of random [[linear code]]s, the [[subset sum problem]] ([[Naccache-Stern knapsack cryptosystem]]), or other problems.

==Universal one-way function==
There is an explicit function ''f'' that has been proved to be one-way, if and only if one-way functions exist.&lt;ref name="HCPred"&gt;{{Cite journal
  | author = [[Leonid Levin]]
  | title = The Tale of One-Way Functions
  | publisher = ACM
  | year = 2003
  | arxiv = cs.CR/0012023
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, if any function is one-way, then so is ''f''.  Since this function was the first combinatorial complete one-way function to be demonstrated, it is known as the "universal one-way function". The problem of finding a one way function is thus reduced to proving that one such function exists.

There are two common ways to measure the length of a solution.  The first is to count the number of quarter turns. The second is to count the number of outer-layer twists, called "face turns". A move to turn an outer layer two quarter (90°) turns in the same direction would be counted as two moves in the quarter turn metric (QTM), but as one turn in the face metric (FTM, or HTM "Half Turn Metric", or OBTM "Outer Block Turn Metric").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#12a3|title=World Cube Association|website=www.worldcubeassociation.org|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum number of face turns needed to solve any instance of the Rubik's Cube is 20,&lt;ref name="cube20_ftm" /&gt; and the maximum number of quarter turns is 26.&lt;ref name="cube20_qtm" /&gt; These numbers are also the [[Distance (graph theory)|diameters]] of the corresponding  [[Cayley graph]]s of the [[Rubik's Cube group]]. In STM (slice turn metric) it's unknown.

There are many [[algorithm]]s to solve scrambled [[Rubik's Cube]]s. An algorithm that solves a cube in the minimum number of moves is known as [[God's algorithm]].

== Move notation ==
{{main|Rubik's_Cube#Move_notation|l1=Rubik's Cube Move notation}}

To denote a sequence of moves on the 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube, this article uses "Singmaster notation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joyner, David |title=Adventures in group theory: Rubik's Cube, Merlin's machine, and Other Mathematical Toys |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2002 |pages=7 |isbn=0-8018-6947-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed by [[David Singmaster]]. 

The letters L, R, F, B, U, and D indicate a clockwise quarter turn of the left, right, front, back, up, and down face respectively. Half turns are indicated by appending a 2. A counterclockwise quarter turn is indicated by appending a [[Prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] (&amp;nbsp;′&amp;nbsp;).

The letters M, S and E are used to denote the turning of a middle layer. M represents turning the layer between the R and L faces 1 quarter turn top to bottom. S represents turning the layer between the F and B faces 1 quarter turn clockwise, as seen from the front. E represents turning the layer between the U and D faces 1 quarter turn clockwise left to right. As with regular turns, a 2 signifies a double turn and a prime (') indicates a quarter turn anticlockwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/|title=Rubik's Cube Notation|work=Ruwix|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters X, Y and Z are used to signify cube rotations. X signifies the rotation of the cube forwards 90 degrees. Y signifies the rotation of the cube to the left 90 degrees. Z signifies the rotation of the cube clockwise 90 degrees. These cube rotations are used in algorithms to the algorithms smoother and faster. As with regular turns, a 2 signifies a half rotation and a prime (') indicates a quarter rotation in the opposite direction. Note that these letters are usually lowercase instead.

==Lower bounds==

It can be proven by counting arguments that there exist positions needing at least 18 moves to solve. To show this, first count the number of cube positions that exist in total, then count the number of positions achievable using at most 17 moves starting from a solved cube. It turns out that the latter number is smaller. 

This argument was not improved upon for many years. Also, it is not a [[constructive proof]]: it does not exhibit a concrete position that needs this many moves. It was [[conjecture]]d that the so-called [[superflip]] would be a position that is very difficult.  A Rubik's Cube is in the superflip pattern when each corner piece is in the correct position, but each edge piece is incorrectly oriented.&lt;ref name="reid-bryan_1995"&gt;[http://cflmath.com/~reid/Rubik/m_symmetric.html Michael Reid's Rubik's Cube page M-symmetric positions]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, a solution for the superflip with 20 face turns was found by [[Dik T. Winter]], of which the minimality was shown in 1995 by [[Michael Reid (mathematician)|Michael Reid]], providing a new lower bound for the diameter of the cube group. Also in 1995, a solution for superflip in 24 quarter turns was found by Michael Reid, with its minimality proven by [[Jerry Bryan]].&lt;ref name="reid-bryan_1995"/&gt; In 1998, a new position requiring more than 24 quarter turns to solve was found. The position, which was called a 'superflip composed with four spot' needs 26 quarter turns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cflmath.com/~reid/Rubik/Cubelovers/cube-mail-25 Posted to Cube lovers on 2 Aug 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upper bounds==

The first upper bounds were based on the 'human' algorithms. By combining the worst-case scenarios for each part of these algorithms, the typical upper bound was found to be around 100.

Perhaps the first concrete value for an upper bound was the 277 moves mentioned by [[David Singmaster]] in early 1979. He simply counted the maximum number of moves required by his cube-solving algorithm.&lt;ref name="rikvangrol_2010" /&gt;{{sfn|Singmaster|1981|p=16}} Later, Singmaster reported that [[Elwyn Berlekamp]], [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]], and Richard Guy had come up with a different algorithm that took at most 160 moves.&lt;ref name="rikvangrol_2010" /&gt;{{sfn|Singmaster|1981|p=26}} Soon after, Conway’s Cambridge Cubists reported that the cube could be restored in at most 94 moves.&lt;ref name="rikvangrol_2010" /&gt;{{sfn|Singmaster|1981|p=30}}

===Thistlethwaite's algorithm===
The breakthrough, known as "descent through nested sub-groups" was found by [[Morwen Thistlethwaite]]; details of [[Morwen Thistlethwaite#Thistlethwaite's algorithm|Thistlethwaite's algorithm]] were published in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1981 by [[Douglas Hofstadter]]. The approaches to the cube that led to algorithms with very few moves are based on [[group (mathematics)|group theory]] and on extensive computer searches. Thistlethwaite's idea was to divide the problem into subproblems. Where algorithms up to that point divided the problem by looking at the parts of the cube that should remain fixed, he divided it by restricting the type of moves that could be executed. In particular he divided the [[Rubik's Cube group|cube group]] into the following chain of subgroups:

*&lt;math&gt;G_0=\langle L,R,F,B,U,D\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;G_1=\langle L,R,F,B,U^2,D^2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;G_2=\langle L,R,F^2,B^2,U^2,D^2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;G_3=\langle L^2,R^2,F^2,B^2,U^2,D^2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;G_4=\{1\}&lt;/math&gt;

Next he prepared tables for each of the right [[coset]] spaces &lt;math&gt;G_{i+1}\setminus G_i&lt;/math&gt;. For each element he found a sequence of moves that took it to the next smaller group. After these preparations he worked as follows. A random cube is in the general cube group &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;. Next he found this element in the right [[coset]] space &lt;math&gt;G_1\setminus G_0&lt;/math&gt;. He applied the corresponding process to the cube. This took it to a cube in &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt;. Next he looked up a process that takes the cube to &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;, next to &lt;math&gt;G_3&lt;/math&gt; and finally to &lt;math&gt;G_4&lt;/math&gt;.
[[File:Rubik-3-facelet-kociemba.png|thumb|Intermediate state of the Rubik's Cube in Kociemba's algorithm. Any state from G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; will have the "+" and "–" symbols as shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kociemba.org/math/20moves/subgroupH.html |title=The Subgroup H and its cosets |author=Herbert Kociemba |accessdate=2013-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|518x518px]]

Although the whole cube group &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt; is very large (~4.3&amp;times;10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;), the right coset spaces &lt;math&gt;G_1\setminus G_0, G_2\setminus G_1, G_3\setminus G_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_3&lt;/math&gt; are much smaller.
The coset space &lt;math&gt;G_2\setminus G_1&lt;/math&gt; is the largest and contains only 1082565 elements. The number of moves required by this algorithm is the sum of the largest process in each step.

Initially, Thistlethwaite showed that any configuration could be solved in at most 85 moves. In January 1980 he improved his strategy to yield a maximum of 80 moves. Later that same year, he reduced the number to 63, and then again to 52.&lt;ref name="rikvangrol_2010" /&gt; By exhaustively searching the coset spaces it was later found that the best possible number of moves for each stage was 7, 10, 13, and 15 giving a total of 45 moves at most.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cubeman.org/dotcs.txt Progressive Improvements in Solving Algorithms]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kociemba's algorithm===
Thistlethwaite's algorithm was improved by [[Herbert Kociemba]] in 1992. He reduced the number of intermediate groups to only two:
*&lt;math&gt;G_0=\langle U,D,L,R,F,B\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;G_1=\langle U,D,L^2,R^2,F^2,B^2\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;G_2=\{1\}&lt;/math&gt;

As with [[Morwen Thistlethwaite#Thistlethwaite's algorithm|Thistlethwaite's Algorithm]], he would search through the right coset space &lt;math&gt;G_1\setminus G_0&lt;/math&gt; to take the cube to group &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt;. Next he searched the optimal solution for group &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt;. The searches in &lt;math&gt;G_1\setminus G_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; were both done with a method equivalent to [[IDA*]]. The search in &lt;math&gt;G_1\setminus G_0&lt;/math&gt; needs at most 12 moves and the search in &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; at most 18 moves, as Michael Reid showed in 1995. By also generating suboptimal solutions that take the cube to group &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt; and looking for short solutions in &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt;, much shorter overall solutions are usually obtained. Using this algorithm solutions are typically found of fewer than 21 moves, though there is no proof that it will always do so.

In 1995 Michael Reid proved that using these two groups every position can be solved in at most 29 face turns, or in 42 quarter turns. This result was improved by Silviu Radu in 2005 to 40.

At first glance, this algorithm appears to be impractically inefficient - If &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;contains 18 possible moves (each move, its prime, and its 180 degree rotation), that leaves &lt;math&gt;18^{12}&lt;/math&gt;(Over 1 quadrillion) cube states to be searched.  Even with a [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]]-based computer algorithm like [[Iterative deepening A*|IDA*]], which may narrow it down considerably, searching through that many states is likely not practical.  To solve this problem, Kociemba devised a lookup table that provides an exact heuristic for &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kociemba.org/cube.htm|title=Solve Rubik's Cube with Cube Explorer|website=kociemba.org|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the exact number of moves needed to reach &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt;is available, the search becomes virtually instantaneous - one need only generate 18 cube state for each of the 12 moves and choose the one with the lowest heuristic each time.  This allows the second heuristic, that for &lt;math&gt;G_1&lt;/math&gt;, to be less precise and still allow for a solution to be computed in reasonable time on a modern computer.

===Korf's algorithm===
Using these group solutions combined with computer searches will generally quickly give very short solutions. But these solutions do not always come with a guarantee of their minimality. To search specifically for minimal solutions a new approach was needed.

In 1997 Richard Korf&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article
 | author = Richard Korf
 | title = Finding Optimal Solutions to Rubik's Cube Using Pattern Databases
 | url = http://www-compsci.swan.ac.uk/~csphil/CS335/korfrubik.pdf
 | year = 1997
}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced an algorithm with which he had optimally solved random instances of the cube. Of the ten random cubes he did, none required more than 18 face turns. The method he used is called [[IDA*]] and is described in his paper "Finding Optimal Solutions to Rubik's Cube Using Pattern Databases". Korf describes this method as follows
: IDA* is a depth-first search that looks for increasingly longer solutions in a series of iterations, using a lower-bound heuristic to prune branches once a lower bound on their length exceeds the current iterations bound.

It works roughly as follows. First he identified a number of subproblems that are small enough to be solved optimally. He used:

#The cube restricted to only the corners, not looking at the edges
#The cube restricted to only 6 edges, not looking at the corners nor at the other edges.
#The cube restricted to the other 6 edges.

Clearly the number of moves required to solve any of these subproblems is a lower bound for the number of moves needed to solve the entire cube.

Given a [[random]] cube C, it is solved as [[iterative deepening]]. First all cubes are generated that are the result of applying 1 move to them. That is C * F, C * U, … Next, from this list, all cubes are generated that are the result of applying two moves. Then three moves and so on. If at any point a cube is found that needs too many moves based on the upper bounds to still be optimal it can be eliminated from the list.

Although this [[algorithm]] will always find optimal solutions, there is no worst case analysis. It is not known how many moves this algorithm might need. An implementation of this algorithm can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cflmath.com/~reid/Rubik/optimal_solver.html Michael Reid's Optimal Solver for Rubik's Cube] (requires a compiler such as gcc)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further improvements, and finding God's Number===
In 2006, Silviu Radu further improved his methods to prove that every position can be solved in at most 27 face turns or 35 quarter turns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cubezzz.dyndns.org/drupal/?q=node/view/53 Rubik can be solved in 27f]&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Kunkle and Gene Cooperman in 2007 used a [[supercomputer]] to show that all unsolved cubes can be solved in no more than 26 moves (in face-turn metric). Instead of attempting to solve each of the billions of variations explicitly, the computer was programmed to bring the cube to one of 15,752 states, each of which could be solved within a few extra moves. All were proved solvable in 29 moves, with most solvable in 26. Those that could not initially be solved in 26 moves were then solved explicitly, and shown that they too could be solved in 26 moves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neu.edu/nupr/news/0507/rubik.html Press Release on Proof that 26 Face Turns Suffice]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Tomas Rokicki reported in a 2008 computational proof that all unsolved cubes could be solved in 25 moves or fewer.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite arxiv
|eprint=0803.3435
|title=Twenty-Five Moves Suffice for Rubik's Cube

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later reduced to 23 moves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cubezzz.dyndns.org/drupal/?q=node/view/117 Twenty-Three Moves Suffice] — Domain of the Cube Forum&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008 Rokicki announced that he had a proof for 22 moves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cubezzz.dyndns.org/drupal/?q=node/view/121 twenty-two moves suffice]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in 2010, Tomas Rokicki, Herbert Kociemba, Morley Davidson, and John Dethridge gave the final [[computer-assisted proof]] that all cube positions could be solved with a maximum of 20 face turns.&lt;ref name="cube20_ftm" /&gt;
In 2009, Tomas Rokicki proved that 29 moves in the quarter-turn metric is enough to solve any scrambled cube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cubezzz.dyndns.org/drupal/?q=node/view/143|title=Twenty-Nine QTM Moves Suffice|author = Tom Rokicki|accessdate= 2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in 2014, Tomas Rokicki and Morley Davidson proved that the maximum number of quarter-turns needed to solve the cube is 26.&lt;ref name="cube20_qtm" /&gt;

The face-turn and quarter-turn metrics differ in the nature of their antipodes.&lt;ref name="cube20_qtm" /&gt;
An antipode is a scrambled cube that is maximally far from solved, one that requires the maximum number of moves to solve. In the half-turn metric with a maximum number of 20, there are hundreds of millions of such positions. In the quarter-turn metric, only a single position (and its two rotations) is known that requires the maximum of 26 moves. Despite significant effort, no additional quarter-turn distance-26 positions have been found.{{update inline|date=October 2016}} Even at distance 25, only two positions (and their rotations) are known to exist.&lt;ref name="cube20_qtm" /&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=There must be more. Every rotation from a distance-26 position should lead to a distance-25 position (or another 26 position).|date=August 2018}} At distance 24, perhaps 150,000 positions exist.

'''Oskar Bolza'''  (12 May 1857 – 5 July 1942) was a [[Germans|German]] [[mathematician]], and student of [[Felix Klein]]. He was born in [[Bad Bergzabern]], [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], then a district of [[Bavaria]], known for his research in the [[calculus of variations]], particularly influenced by [[Karl Weierstrass]]' 1879 lectures on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George F. |last=Simmons |title=Calculus Gems: Brief Lives and Memorable Mathematics |location= |publisher= |year=2007 |isbn=0-88385-561-5 |pages=209–10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KOst4Mon90C&amp;pg=PA209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Bolza entered the University of Berlin in 1875. His first interest was [[linguistics]], then he studied physics with [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]] and [[Helmholtz]], but experimental work did not attract him, so he decided on mathematics in 1878. The years 1878–1881 were spent studying under [[Elwin Christoffel]] and [[Theodor Reye]] at Strasbourg, [[Hermann Schwarz]] at Göttingen, and particularly [[Karl Weierstrass]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Cooke, Roger and Rickey, V. Frederick (1989) ''W.E. Story of Hopkins and Clark.'' in Duren, Peter et al. (ed.): ''A Century of Mathematics in America. Part III.'', page 30, [[American Mathematical Society]], {{ISBN|0-8218-0130-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1888 he landed in [[Hoboken, NJ]], searching for a job in the United States: he succeeded in finding a position in 1889 at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and then at the then newly founded [[Clark University]].&lt;ref name="bliss1"&gt;According to {{harvtxt|Bliss|1944|p=480}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892 Bolza joined the [[University of Chicago]] and worked there up to 1910 when, after becoming unhappy in the United States as a consequence of the death of his friend [[Heinrich Maschke]] in 1908, he and his wife returned to [[Freiburg]] in Germany. The events of [[World War I]] greatly affected Bolza and, after 1914, he stopped his research in mathematics. He became interested in religious psychology, languages (particularly [[Sanskrit]]), and Indian religions. He published the book ''Glaubenlose Religion'' (religion without belief) in 1930 under the pseudonym F. H. Marneck. However, later in his life he returned to do research in mathematics, lecturing at [[University of Freiburg]] from 1929 up to his retirement in 1933.

===Academic career===
He completed his doctoral studies, after eight years of study and many changes of direction, in 1886, from the [[Georg-August-Universität Göttingen]]. He wrote his thesis, titled ''Über die Reduction hyperelliptischer Integrale erster Ordnung und erster Gattung auf elliptische, insbesondere über die Reduction durch eine Transformation vierten Grades'' (translated as ''On reduction of hyperelliptic integrals of first order and first kind to elliptic integrals, especially on reduction by transformation of fourth degree''&lt;ref&gt;See the full text of his thesis {{harv|Bolza|1886}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) under the supervision of [[Felix Klein]].

In 1889 Bolza worked at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where [[Simon Newcomb]] gave him a temporary short-term appointment "[[Reader (academic rank)|reader in mathematics]]", then he obtained a position as an [[associate professor]] at [[Clark University]].&lt;ref name="bliss1"/&gt; While at Clark, Bolza published the important paper ''On the theory of substitution groups and its application to algebraic equations'' in the [[American Journal of Mathematics]]. In 1892 Bolza joined the [[University of Chicago]] and worked there up to 1910, when he decided to return to [[Freiburg]] in Germany: he was appointed there as honorary professor,&lt;ref&gt;Precisely "''Ordentlicher Honorar Professor''", according to {{harvtxt|Bliss|1944|p=481}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while the University Chicago awarded him the title of "''non-resident professor of mathematics''" which he retained for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;According to {{harvtxt|Bliss|1944|p=481}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Research activity===
Bolza published ''The elliptic s-functions considered as a special case of the hyperelliptic s-functions'' in 1900 which related to work he had been studying for his doctorate under Klein. However, he worked on the calculus of variations from 1901. Papers which appeared in the [[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] over the next few years were: ''New proof of a theorem of Osgood's in the calculus of variations'' (1901); ''Proof of the sufficiency of Jacobi's condition for a permanent sign of the second variation in the so-called isoperimetric problems'' (1902); ''Weierstrass' theorem and Kneser's theorem on transversals for the most general case of an extremum of a simple definite integral'' (1906); and ''Existence proof for a field of extremals tangent to a given curve'' (1907). His text ''Lectures on the Calculus of Variations'' published by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in 1904,&lt;ref&gt;See reference {{harv|Bolza|1904}}.&lt;/ref&gt; became a classic in its field and was republished several times: the augmented German edition of the same work&lt;ref&gt;See reference {{harv|Bolza|1909}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was considered by his former student [[Gilbert Ames Bliss]] "''a classic, indispensable to every scholar in the field, and much wider in its scope than his earlier book''".&lt;ref&gt;See {{harv|Bliss|1944|p=484}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after his return to Germany Bolza continued teaching and research, in particular on function theory, integral equations and the calculus of variations. Two papers of 1913 and 1914 are particularly important. The first ''Problem mit gemischten Bedingungen und variablen Endpunkten'' formulated a new type of variational problem now called "''the Bolza problem of Bolza''" after him and the second studied variations for an integral problem involving inequalities. This latter work was to become important in control theory. Bolza returned to Chicago for part of 1913 giving lecturers during the summer on function theory and integral equations.

===Teaching activity===
Bolza joined the [[University of Chicago]] in 1892. Between 1892 and 1910 the mathematics department was outstandingly successful with thirty-nine students graduating with doctorates (nine of them students of Bolza). These included [[Leonard Dickson]], who was the first to be awarded a [[Ph.D.]] in mathematics by the University of Chicago, [[Gilbert Bliss]], [[Oswald Veblen]], [[Robert Lee Moore]], [[George D. Birkhoff]], and [[T. H. Hildebrandt]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8756">In [[signal processing]], a '''periodogram''' is an estimate of the [[spectral density]] of a signal.&amp;nbsp;  The term was coined by [[Arthur Schuster]] in 1898.&lt;ref name="Schuster"/&gt; Today, the periodogram is a component of more sophisticated methods (see [[spectral estimation]]).  It is the most common tool for examining the amplitude vs frequency characteristics of [[FIR filter]]s and [[window functions]].  [[spectrum analyzer|FFT spectrum analyzers]] are also implemented as a time-sequence of periodograms.

==Definition==
There are at least two different definitions in use today.  One of them involves time-averaging,&lt;ref name="Wolfram"/&gt; and one does not.&lt;ref name="Matlab"/&gt; Time-averaging is also the purview of other articles ([[Bartlett's method]] and [[Welch's method]]).  This article is not about time-averaging.  The definition of interest here is that the power spectral density of a continuous function, &lt;math&gt;x(t),&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; is the [[Fourier transform]] of its auto-correlation function (see [[Fourier transform#Cross-correlation theorem|Cross-correlation theorem]]):

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}\{x(t)*x(-t)\} = X(f)\cdot X^*(f) = \left| X(f) \right|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

==Computation==
For sufficiently small values of parameter '''T''', an arbitrarily-accurate approximation for X(f) can be observed in the region &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;-\tfrac{1}{2T} &lt; f &lt; \tfrac{1}{2T}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; of the function:

:&lt;math&gt;X_{1/T}(f)\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} X\left(f - k/T\right),&lt;/math&gt;

which is precisely determined by the samples x(nT) that span the non-zero duration of x(t) &amp;nbsp;(see [[Discrete-time Fourier transform]]).

And for sufficiently large values of parameter '''N''', &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;X_{1/T}(f)&lt;/math&gt; can be evaluated at an arbitrarily close frequency by a summation of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;X_{1/T}\left(\tfrac{k}{NT}\right) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \underbrace{T\cdot x(nT)}_{x[n]}\cdot e^{-i 2\pi \frac{kn}{N}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is an integer.  The periodicity of &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;e^{-i 2\pi \frac{kn}{N}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; allows this to be written very simply in terms of a [[Discrete Fourier transform]]:

:&lt;math&gt;X_{1/T}\left(\tfrac{k}{NT}\right) = \underbrace{\sum_{n} x_N[n]\cdot e^{-i 2\pi \frac{kn}{N}},}_{DFT}\quad \scriptstyle{\text{(sum over any }n\text{-sequence of length }N)},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; is a periodic summation: &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;x_N[n]\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n-mN].&lt;/math&gt;

When evaluated for all integers, k, between 0 and N-1, the array:

:&lt;math&gt;S\left(\tfrac{k}{NT}\right) = \left| \sum_{n} x_N[n]\cdot e^{-i 2\pi \frac{kn}{N}}  \right|^2&lt;/math&gt;

is a ''periodogram''.&lt;ref name="Matlab"/&gt;

==Applications==

[[File:Periodogram for Proxima Centauri b.jpg|thumb|Periodogram for [[Proxima Centauri b]] is shown at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do-it-yourself Science — is Proxima c hiding in this graph?|url=https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1737a/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The parameter '''N''' is known to Matlab and Octave users as NFFT.&lt;ref name="Matlab"/&gt;&amp;nbsp; When a periodogram is used to examine the detailed characteristics of an [[FIR filter]] or [[window function]], '''N''' is chosen to be several multiples of the non-zero duration of the x[n] sequence, which is called ''zero-padding'' (see [[Discrete-time Fourier transform#Sampling the DTFT|Sampling the DTFT]]).  And when it is used to implement a [[filter bank]], '''N''' is several '''sub'''-multiples of the non-zero duration of the x[n] sequence (see [[Discrete-time Fourier transform#Sampling the DTFT|Sampling the DTFT]]).

One of the periodogram's deficiencies is that the variance at a given [[frequency]] does not decrease as the number of samples used in the computation increases.  It does not provide the averaging needed to analyze noiselike signals or even sinusoids at low signal-to-noise ratios.  Window functions and filter impulse responses are noiseless, but many other signals require more sophisticated methods of [[spectral estimation]].  Two of the alternatives use periodograms as part of the process:
*The ''method of averaged periodograms'',&lt;ref name="Engelberg"/&gt;&amp;nbsp; more commonly known as [[Welch's method]],&lt;ref name="Welch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Welch2"/&gt;&amp;nbsp; divides a long x[n] sequence into multiple shorter, and possibly overlapping, subsequences.  It computes a windowed periodogram of each one, and computes an array average, i.e. an array where each element is an average of the corresponding elements of all the periodograms.  For [[stationary process]]es, this reduces the noise variance of each element by approximately a factor equal to the reciprocal of the number of periodograms.
*[[Smoothing]] is an averaging technique in frequency, instead of time.  The smoothed periodogram is sometimes referred to as a ''spectral plot''.&lt;ref name="smoothing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dataplot"/&gt;

Periodogram-based techniques introduce small biases that are unacceptable in some applications.  Other techniques that do not rely on periodograms are presented in the [[spectral density estimation]] article.

A '''planar Fourier capture array (PFCA)''' is a tiny camera that requires no mirror, lens, focal length, or moving parts.&lt;ref name="AppliedOptics"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5940245&amp;tag=1 P. R. Gill, C. Lee, D.-G. Lee, A. Wang, and A. Molnar, "A microscale camera using direct fourier-domain scene capture," Opt.

[[Angle-sensitive pixel]]s have a sensitivity to light that is sinusoidal in incident angle along the optically-sensitive axis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?id=187233 A. Wang, P. Gill, and A. Molnar, "Light field image sensors based on the talbot effect," Applied Optics, vol. 48, no. 31, pp. 5897–5905, 2009. ]&lt;/ref&gt; which can be interpreted as measuring one component of the [[Fourier transform#Two-dimensional functions|2D Fourier transform]] of the far-away scene.  By making them all unique, each sensor of the PFCA relates a distinct component of the 2D Fourier transform of the far-away scene, and together they relate full Fourier information.  Original images are reconstructed computationally after acquisition, or if raw Fourier coefficients are more useful for the application at hand, they are used directly.

PFCAs do not perform an exact Fourier transform since outputs are real-valued and are not perfect sinusoidal transforms of the image.  The transform is closer to a [[Hartley transform]], but even this correspondence is not exact.  Still, the mathematics underlying completeness of the Fourier transform are useful in designing and understanding PFCAs.&lt;ref name="JINST" /&gt;

Because PFCAs do not require focusing optics or moving parts, they can be made smaller than the smallest focusing camera.  Counting only the active portions of the PFCA (and not the structural substrate giving it physical robustness), PFCAs are a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; smaller than the smallest focusing camera by volume.&lt;ref name="AppliedOptics" /&gt;

In [[topology]], a branch of mathematics, a '''retraction''' is a [[continuous mapping]] from a [[topological space]] into a subspace which preserves the position of all points in that subspace.&lt;ref&gt;Borsuk (1931).&lt;/ref&gt; A '''deformation retraction''' is a mapping which captures the idea of ''continuously shrinking'' a space into a subspace.

An '''absolute neighborhood retract''' ('''ANR''') is a particularly [[well-behaved]] type of topological space. For example, every [[topological manifold]] is an ANR. Every ANR has the [[homotopy type]] of a very simple topological space, a [[CW complex]].

== Definitions ==

=== Retract ===
Let ''X'' be a topological space and ''A'' a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of ''X''. Then a continuous map
:&lt;math&gt;r\colon X \to A&lt;/math&gt;

is a '''retraction''' if the [[function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restriction]] of ''r'' to ''A'' is the [[Identity function|identity map]] on ''A''; that is, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r(a) = a&lt;/math&gt; for all ''a'' in ''A''. Equivalently, denoting by

:&lt;math&gt;\iota\colon A \hookrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;
the [[Inclusion map|inclusion]], a retraction is a continuous map ''r'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;r \circ \iota = \operatorname{id}_A,&lt;/math&gt;
that is, the composition of ''r'' with the inclusion is the identity of ''A''. Note that, by definition, a retraction maps ''X'' [[onto]] ''A''. A subspace ''A'' is called a '''retract''' of ''X'' if such a retraction exists. For instance, any non-empty space retracts to a point in the obvious way (the constant map yields a retraction). If ''X'' is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], then ''A'' must be a [[closed subset]] of ''X''.

If &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r: X \to A&lt;/math&gt; is a retraction, then the composition ι∘''r'' is an [[idempotent]] continuous map from ''X'' to ''X''. Conversely, given any idempotent continuous map &lt;math display="inline"&gt;s: X \to X,&lt;/math&gt; we obtain a retraction onto the image of ''s'' by restricting the [[codomain]].

=== Deformation retract and strong deformation retract===
A continuous map
:&lt;math&gt;F\colon X \times [0, 1] \to X &lt;/math&gt;
is a ''deformation retraction'' of a space ''X'' onto a subspace ''A'' if, for every ''x'' in ''X'' and ''a'' in ''A'',
:&lt;math&gt; F(x,0) = x, \; F(x,1) \in A ,\quad \mbox{and} \quad F(a,1) = a.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, a deformation retraction is a [[homotopy]] between a retraction and the identity map on ''X''. The subspace ''A'' is called a '''deformation retract''' of ''X''. A deformation retraction is a special case of a [[homotopy equivalence]].

A retract need not be a deformation retract. For instance, having a single point as a deformation retract of a space ''X'' would imply that ''X'' is [[path connected]] (and in fact that ''X'' is [[contractible space|contractible]]).

''Note:'' An equivalent definition of deformation retraction is the following. A continuous map &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r: X \to A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Deformation theory|deformation]] retraction if it is a retraction and its composition with the inclusion is homotopic to the identity map on ''X''. In this formulation, a deformation retraction carries with it a homotopy between the identity map on ''X'' and itself.

If, in the definition of a deformation retraction, we add the requirement that
:&lt;math&gt;F(a,t) = a&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''t'' in [0, 1] and ''a'' in ''A'', then ''F'' is called a '''strong deformation retraction'''. In other words, a strong deformation retraction leaves points in ''A'' fixed throughout the homotopy. (Some authors, such as [[Allen Hatcher|Hatcher]], take this as the definition of deformation retraction.)

As an example, the [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]] ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;S^{n}&lt;/math&gt;'' is a strong deformation retract of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\reals^{n+1} \backslash \{0\};&lt;/math&gt; as strong deformation retraction one can choose the map 

:&lt;math&gt;F(x,t)=\left((1-t)+{t\over \|x\|}\right) x.&lt;/math&gt;

===Cofibration and neighborhood deformation retract===
A map ''f'': ''A'' → ''X'' of topological spaces is a ([[Witold Hurewicz|Hurewicz]]) '''[[cofibration]]''' if it has the [[homotopy extension property]] for maps to any space. This is one of the central concepts of [[homotopy theory]]. A cofibration ''f'' is always injective, in fact a [[homeomorphism]] to its image.&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher (2002), Proposition 4H.1.&lt;/ref&gt; If ''X'' is Hausdorff (or a [[compactly generated space|compactly generated]] [[weak Hausdorff space]]), then the image of a cofibration ''f'' is closed in ''X''.

Among all closed inclusions, cofibrations can be characterized as follows. The inclusion of a closed subspace ''A'' in a space ''X'' is a cofibration if and only if ''A'' is a '''neighborhood deformation retract''' of ''X'', meaning that there is a continuous map &lt;math&gt;u: X \rightarrow I&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I = [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math display="inline"&gt;A = u^{-1}\!\left(0\right)&lt;/math&gt; and a homotopy &lt;math display="inline"&gt;H: X \times I \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;such that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;H\left(x,0\right) = x \quad \forall x \in X,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;H\left(a,t\right) = a \quad \forall (a,t) \in A \times I,&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;h\left(x,1\right) \in A \; \text{if} \; u(x) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Puppe (1967), Satz 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the inclusion of a subcomplex in a CW complex is a cofibration.

==Properties==
* One basic property of a retract ''A'' of ''X'' (with retraction &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r: X \to A&lt;/math&gt;) is that every continuous map &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f: A \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; has at least one extension &lt;math display="inline"&gt;g: X \rightarrow Y,&lt;/math&gt; namely &lt;math display="inline"&gt;g = f \circ r&lt;/math&gt;.
* Deformation retraction is a particular case of homotopy equivalence. In fact, two spaces are homotopy equivalent [[if and only if]] they are both deformation retracts of a single larger space.
* Any topological space which deformation retracts to a point is contractible and vice versa. However, there exist contractible spaces which do not strongly deformation retract to a point.&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher (2002), Exercise 0.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==No-retraction theorem==
The [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of the [[N-ball|''n''-dimensional ball]], that is, the (''n''−1)-sphere, is not a retract of the ball. (See {{Section link|Brouwer fixed-point theorem|A proof using homology}}.)

==Absolute neighborhood retract (ANR)==
A closed subset &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of a topological space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''neighborhood retract''' of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a retract of some open subset of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a class of topological spaces, closed under homeomorphisms and passage to closed subsets. Following [[Karol Borsuk|Borsuk]] (starting in 1931), a space ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'' is called an '''absolute retract''' for the class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\operatorname{AR} \left(\mathcal{C}\right),&lt;/math&gt; if ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and whenever ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;'' is a closed subset of a space  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a retract of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. A space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an '''absolute neighborhood retract''' for the class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, written &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\operatorname{ANR} \left(\mathcal{C}\right),&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and whenever &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subset of a space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a neighborhood retract of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

Various classes &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; such as [[normal space]]s have been considered in this definition, but the class &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; of [[metrizable space]]s has been found to give the most satisfactory theory. For that reason, the notations AR and ANR by themselves are used in this article to mean &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {AR} \left({\mathcal {M}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {ANR} \left({\mathcal {M}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mardešiċ (1999), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

A metrizable space is an AR if and only if it is contractible and an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Proposition II.7.2.&lt;/ref&gt; By [[James Dugundji|Dugundji]], every locally convex metrizable [[topological vector space]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is an AR; more generally, every nonempty [[convex set|convex subset]] of such a vector space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is an AR.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Corollary II.14.2 and Theorem II.3.1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, any [[normed vector space]] ([[complete metric space|complete]] or not) is an AR. More concretely, Euclidean space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\reals^{n},&lt;/math&gt; the [[unit cube]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I^{n},&lt;/math&gt;and the [[Hilbert cube]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;I^{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; are ARs.

ANRs form a remarkable class of "[[Well behaved|well-behaved]]" topological spaces. Among their properties are:
*Every open subset of an ANR is an ANR. 
*By [[Olof Hanner|Hanner]], a metrizable space that has an [[open cover]] by ANRs is an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Theorem III.8.1.&lt;/ref&gt; (That is, being an ANR is a '''[[local property]]''' for metrizable spaces.) It follows that every topological manifold is an ANR. For example, the sphere ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;S^{n}&lt;/math&gt;'' is an ANR but not an AR (because it is not contractible). In infinite dimensions, Hanner's theorem implies that every Hilbert cube manifold as well as the (rather different, for example not [[locally compact space|locally compact]]) [[Hilbert manifold]]s and [[Banach manifold]]s are ANRs.
*Every locally finite [[CW complex]] is an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Mardešiċ (1999), p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; An arbitrary CW complex need not be metrizable, but every CW complex has the homotopy type of an ANR (which is metrizable, by definition).&lt;ref&gt;Fritsch &amp; Piccinini (1990), Theorem 5.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Every ANR ''X'' is '''[[locally contractible]]''' in the sense that for every open neighborhood &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of a point &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, there is an open neighborhood &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; contained in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; such that the inclusion &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V \hookrightarrow U&lt;/math&gt; is homotopic to a [[constant map]]. A [[covering dimension|finite-dimensional]] metrizable space is an ANR if and only if it is locally contractible in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Theorem V.7.1.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Cantor set]] is a [[compact space|compact]] subset of the real line that is not an ANR, since it is not even [[locally connected]].
*Counterexamples: Borsuk found a compact subset of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\reals^{3}&lt;/math&gt; that is an ANR but not strictly locally contractible.&lt;ref&gt;Borsuk (1967), section IV.4.&lt;/ref&gt; (A space is '''strictly locally contractible''' if every open neighborhood &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of each point &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; contains a contractible open neighborhood of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.) Borsuk also found a compact subset of the Hilbert cube that is locally contractible (as defined above) but not an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Borsuk (1967), Theorem V.11.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Every ANR has the homotopy type of a CW complex, by [[J. H. C. Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[John Milnor|Milnor]].&lt;ref&gt;Fritsch &amp; Piccinini (1990), Theorem 5.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, a locally compact ANR has the homotopy type of a locally finite CW complex; and, by West, a compact ANR has the homotopy type of a finite CW complex.&lt;ref&gt;West (2004), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, ANRs avoid all the homotopy-theoretic pathologies of arbitrary topological spaces. For example, the [[Whitehead theorem]] holds for ANRs: a map of ANRs that induces an isomorphism on [[homotopy group]]s (for all choices of base point) is a homotopy equivalence. Since ANRs include topological manifolds, Hilbert cube manifolds, Banach manifolds, and so on, these results apply to a large class of spaces.
*Many mapping spaces are ANRs. In particular, let ''Y'' be an ANR with a closed subspace ''A'' that is an ANR, and let ''X'' be any compact metrizable space with a closed subspace ''B''. Then the space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left(Y, A\right)^{\left(X, B\right)}&lt;/math&gt; of maps of [[topological pair|pairs]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\left(X, B\right) \rightarrow \left(Y, A\right)&lt;/math&gt; (with the [[compact-open topology]] on the [[Function space|mapping space]]) is an ANR.&lt;ref&gt;Hu (1965), Theorem VII.3.1 and Remark VII.2.3.&lt;/ref&gt; It follows, for example, that the [[loop space]] of any CW complex has the homotopy type of a CW complex.
*By Cauty, a metrizable space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is an ANR if and only if every open subset of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has the homotopy type of a CW complex.&lt;ref&gt;Cauty (1994), Fund. Math. 144: 11–22.&lt;/ref&gt;
*By Cauty, there is a [[topological vector space#Topological structure|metric linear space]] ''&lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;'' (meaning a topological vector space with a [[Translation invariant|translation-invariant]] metric) that is not an AR. One can take &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; to be [[separable space|separable]] and an [[F-space]] (that is, a complete metric linear space).&lt;ref&gt;Cauty (1994), Fund. Math. 146: 85–99.&lt;/ref&gt; (By Dugundji's theorem above, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; cannot be locally convex.) Since &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is contractible and not an AR, it is also not an ANR. By Cauty's theorem above, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; has an open subset &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that is not homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. Thus there is a metrizable space &lt;math display="inline"&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that is strictly locally contractible but is not homotopy equivalent to a CW complex. It is not known whether a compact (or locally compact) metrizable space that is strictly locally contractible must be an ANR.

In mathematics, the '''Rogers polynomials''', also called '''Rogers–Askey–Ismail polynomials''' and '''continuous q-ultraspherical polynomials''', are a family of [[orthogonal polynomials]] introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Leonard James Rogers|last=Rogers|year1=1892|year2=1893|year3=1894}} in the course of his work on the [[Rogers–Ramanujan identities]]. They are ''q''-analogs of [[ultraspherical polynomials]], and are the [[Macdonald polynomials]] for the special case of the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; [[affine root system]] {{harv|Macdonald|2003|loc=p.156}}.

{{harvtxt|Askey|Ismail|1983}} and {{harvtxt|Gasper|Rahman|2004|loc=7.4}} discuss the properties of Rogers polynomials in detail.

==Definition==

The Rogers polynomials can be defined in terms of the descending Pochhammer symbol and the [[basic hypergeometric series]] by
:&lt;math&gt; C_n(x;\beta|q) = \frac{(\beta;q)_n}{(q;q)_n}e^{in\theta} {}_2\phi_1(q^{-n},\beta;\beta^{-1}q^{1-n};q,q\beta^{-1}e^{-2i\theta})&lt;/math&gt;
where ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;cos(''θ'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1460">'''Slonimski's Theorem''' is an observation by [[Hayyim Selig Slonimski]] that the sequence of carry digits in a multiplication table is the [[Farey sequence]].

This observation allowed Slonimski to create very compact multiplication tables for use in hand calculations. He received several awards for different devices for presenting these tables. The most common format were [[Joffe Bars]] similar to [[Napier's Rods]].  Joffe Bars were popular in Eastern Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6692">In [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], the '''spectrum of a theory'''
is given by the number of isomorphism classes of models in various cardinalities. More precisely, 
for any [[complete theory]] ''T'' in a  language we write I(''T'', α) for the number of models of ''T'' (up to isomorphism) of cardinality α. The '''spectrum problem''' is to describe the possible behaviors of I(''T'', α) as a function of α. It has been almost completely solved for the case of a countable theory ''T''.

==Early results==
In this section ''T'' is a countable complete theory and ''κ'' is a cardinal.

The [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] shows that if ''I''(''T'',''κ'') is nonzero for one infinite cardinal then it is nonzero for all of them.

[[Morley's categoricity theorem]] was the first main step in solving the spectrum problem: it states that if ''I''(''T'',''κ'') is 1 for some uncountable ''κ'' then it is 1 for all uncountable ''κ''. 

[[Robert Vaught]] showed that ''I''(''T'',ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) cannot be 2. It is easy to find examples where it is any given non-negative integer other than 2.  Morley proved that if ''I''(''T'',ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is infinite then it must be ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; or ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or 2&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. It is not known if it can be ℵ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; if the [[continuum hypothesis]] is false: this is called the [[Vaught conjecture]] and is the main remaining open problem (in 2005) in the theory of the spectrum.

'''Morley's problem''' is a [[conjecture]] (first proposed by [[Michael D. Morley]]) in [[mathematical logic]] that  ''I''(''T'',''κ'') is [[monotonic function|nondecreasing]] in ''κ'' for uncountable ''κ''.  This was proved by [[Saharon Shelah]]. For this, he proved a very deep dichotomy theorem.

Saharon Shelah gave an almost complete solution to the spectrum problem. For a given complete theory ''T'', either ''I''(''T'',''κ'') = 2&lt;sup&gt;''κ''&lt;/sup&gt; for all uncountable cardinals ''κ'', or &lt;math&gt;\textstyle I(T, \aleph_\xi) &lt; \beth_{\omega_1}(|\xi|)&lt;/math&gt; for all ordinals ξ (See [[aleph number]] and [[beth number]] for an explanation of the notation), which is usually much smaller than the bound in the first case. Roughly speaking this means that either there are the maximum possible number of models in all uncountable cardinalities, or there are only "few" models in all uncountable cardinalities. Shelah also gave a description of the possible spectra in the case when there are few models.

==List of possible spectra of a countable theory==
By extending Shelah's work, Bradd Hart, [[Ehud Hrushovski]] and [[Michael C. Laskowski]] gave the following complete solution to the spectrum problem for countable theories in uncountable cardinalities. 
If ''T'' is a countable complete theory, then the number I(''T'', ℵ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;) of isomorphism classes of models is given for ordinals α&gt;0 by the minimum of 2&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and one of the following maps:
#2&lt;sup&gt;ℵ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Examples: there are many examples, in particular any unclassifiable or deep theory, such as the theory of the [[random graph]].
#&lt;math&gt;\beth_{d+1}(|\alpha+\omega|)&lt;/math&gt; for some countable infinite ordinal ''d''. (For finite ''d'' see case 8.)  Examples: The theory with equivalence relations ''E''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; for all β with β+1&lt;''d'', such that every ''E''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; class is a union of infinitely many ''E''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt; classes, and each ''E''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; class is infinite. 
#&lt;math&gt;\beth_{d-1}(|\alpha+\omega|^{2^{\aleph_0}})&lt;/math&gt; for some finite positive ordinal ''d''. Example (for ''d''=1): the theory of countably many independent unary predicates.
#&lt;math&gt;\beth_{d-1}(|\alpha+\omega|^{\aleph_0}+\beth_2)&lt;/math&gt; for some finite positive ordinal ''d''.
#&lt;math&gt;\beth_{d-1}(|\alpha+\omega|+\beth_2)&lt;/math&gt; for some finite positive ordinal ''d'';
#&lt;math&gt;\beth_{d-1}(|\alpha+\omega|^{\aleph_0})&lt;/math&gt; for some finite positive ordinal ''d''. Example (for ''d''=1): the theory of countable many disjoint unary predicates.
#&lt;math&gt;\beth_{d-1}(|\alpha+\omega|+\beth_1)&lt;/math&gt; for some  finite ordinal ''d''≥2;
#&lt;math&gt;\beth_{d-1}(|\alpha+\omega|)&lt;/math&gt; for some finite positive ordinal ''d'';
#&lt;math&gt;\beth_{d-2}(|\alpha+\omega|^{|\alpha+1|})&lt;/math&gt; for some  finite ordinal ''d''≥2; Examples: similar to case 2. 
#&lt;math&gt;\beth_2&lt;/math&gt;. Example: the theory of the integers viewed as an abelian group. 
#&lt;math&gt;|(\alpha+1)^n/G| - |\alpha^n/G|&lt;/math&gt; for finite α, and |α| for infinite α, where ''G'' is some subgroup of the symmetric group on ''n'' ≥ 2 elements. Here, we identify α&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with the set of sequences of length ''n'' of elements of a set of size α. ''G'' [[group action|acts]] on α&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; by permuting the sequence elements, and |α&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;/''G''| denotes the number of orbits of this action. Examples: the theory of the set ω&amp;times;''n'' acted on by the [[wreath product]] of ''G'' with all permutations of ω. 
#&lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. Examples: theories that are categorical in uncountable cardinals, such as the theory of algebraically closed fields in a given characteristic.
#&lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Examples:  theories with a finite model, and the inconsistent theory.

Moreover, all possibilities above occur as the spectrum of some countable complete theory.

The number ''d'' in the list above is the depth of the theory.
If ''T'' is a theory we define a new theory 2&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt; to be the theory with an equivalence relation such that there are infinitely many equivalence classes each of which is a model of ''T''. We also define theories &lt;math&gt;\beth_n(T)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\beth_0(T)=T&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beth_{n+1}(T)=2^{\beth_n(T)}&lt;/math&gt;. Then 
&lt;math&gt;I(\beth_n(T), \lambda)= \min(\beth_n(I(T,\lambda)), 2^\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; . This can be used to construct examples of theories with spectra in the list above for non-minimal values of ''d'' from examples for the minimal value of ''d''.

In [[C++]] [[type conversion]], the '''static_cast''' [[Operators in C and C++|operator]] performs an explicit type conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++|year=2008|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=United States of America|isbn=0321543726|pages=594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==
&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
static_cast&lt;type&gt; (object);
&lt;/source&gt;

The ''type'' parameter must be a data type to which ''object'' can be converted via a known method, whether it be a builtin or a cast. The type can be a reference or an enumerator.
All types of conversions that are well-defined and allowed by the compiler are performed using static_cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thinking in C++|year=2000|publisher=Alan Apt|location=United States of America|isbn=0-13-979809-9|pages=857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The static_cast operator can be used for operations such as:
* Converting a pointer of a base class to a pointer of a nonvirtual derived class,
* Converting numeric data types such as [[Enumerated type|enums]] to [[Integer (computer science)|ints]] or ints to [[Floating point|floats]].

Although static_cast conversions are checked at compile time to prevent obvious incompatibilities, no [[Type system#Dynamic typing|run-time type check]] is performed that would prevent a cast between incompatible data types, such as pointers.  Also, the result of a static_cast from a pointer of a virtual base class to a pointer of a derived class is undefined.

It has been shown that for 1 ≤ ''n'' ≤ 5, the smallest superpermutation on ''n'' symbols has length 1! + 2! + … + ''n''! {{OEIS|A180632}}.  The first five superpermutations have respective lengths 1, 3, 9, 33, and 153, forming the strings 1, 121, 123121321, 123412314231243121342132413214321, and the string:

== Lower and upper bounds ==

=== Lower bound ===
In September 2011, an anonymous poster of the internet imageboard [[4chan]] proved that the smallest superpermutation on ''n'' symbols (''n'' ≥ 2) has at least length ''n''! + (''n''−1)! + (''n''−2)! + ''n'' − 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://warosu.org/sci/thread/S3751105#p3751197|title=Permutations Thread III|last1=Anonymous|first1=|date=17 September 2011|website=Warosu, a 4chan archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proof for this lower bound came to the general public interest in October 2018, after mathematician and computer scientist Robin Houston tweeted about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/24/18019464/4chan-anon-anime-haruhi-math-mystery|title=An anonymous 4chan post could help solve a 25-year-old math mystery|last1=Griggs|first1=Mary Beth|website=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/robinhouston/status/1054637891085918209|title=A curious situation.

=== Upper bound ===
On 20 October 2018, by adapting a construction by Aaron Williams for constructing [[Hamiltonian path|Hamiltonian paths]] through the [[Cayley graph]] of the [[symmetric group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|arxiv=1307.2549v3|first=Williams|last=Aaron|title=Hamiltonicity of the Cayley Digraph on the Symmetric Group Generated by σ = (1 2 ... n) and τ = (1 2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greg Egan]] devised an algorithm to produce superpermutations of length ''n''! + (''n''−1)! + (''n''−2)! + (''n''−3)! + ''n'' − 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/Superpermutations/Superpermutations.html|title=Superpermutations|author=Egan|first=Greg|date=|year=20 October 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 2018, these are the smallest superpermutations known for ''n'' ≥ 7.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9555">In [[mathematics]], the '''symmetric derivative''' is an [[Operator (mathematics)|operation]] generalizing  the ordinary [[derivative]]. It is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Mercer2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter R. Mercer|title=More Calculus of a Single Variable|year=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4939-1926-0|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tp1"&gt;Thomson, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression under the limit is sometimes called the '''symmetric [[difference quotient]]'''.&lt;ref name="LaxTerrell2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter D. Lax|author2=Maria Shea Terrell|title=Calculus With Applications|year=2013|publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4614-7946-8|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HockettBock2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shirley O. Hockett|author2=David Bock|title=Barron's how to Prepare for the AP Calculus|year=2005|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=978-0-7641-2382-5|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; A function is said '''symmetrically differentiable''' at a point ''x'' if its symmetric derivative exists at that point.

If a function is [[differentiable function|differentiable]] (in the usual sense) at a point, then it is also symmetrically differentiable, but the converse is not true. A well-known counterexample is the [[absolute value]] function f(x) = |x|, which is not differentiable at x = 0, but is symmetrically differentiable here with symmetric derivative 0. For differentiable functions, the symmetric difference quotient does provide a better [[Numerical differentiation|numerical approximation of the derivative]] than the usual difference quotient.&lt;ref name="LaxTerrell2013"/&gt;

The symmetric derivative at a given point equals the [[arithmetic mean]] of the [[left and right derivative]]s at that point, if the latter two both exist.&lt;ref name="Mercer2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither [[Rolle's theorem]] nor the [[mean value theorem]] hold for the symmetric derivative; some similar but weaker statements have been proved.

==Examples==

=== The modulus function ===
[[File:Modulusfunction.png|thumb|right|Graph of the [[modulus function]]. Note the sharp turn at x=0, leading to non-differentiability of the curve at x=0. The function hence possesses no ordinary derivative at x=0. The symmetric derivative, however, exists for the function at x=0.]]

For the [[modulus function]], &lt;math&gt;f(x)= \left\vert x \right\vert&lt;/math&gt;, we have, at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_s(0)&amp;= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(0+h) - f(0-h)}{2h} \\
&amp;= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(h) - f(-h)}{2h} \\
&amp;= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{\left\vert h \right\vert - \left\vert -h \right\vert}{2h} \\
&amp;= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{h-(-(-h))}{2h} \\
&amp;= 0 , \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where since &lt;math&gt; h&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\left\vert -h \right\vert&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;-(-h)&lt;/math&gt;. So, we observe that the symmetric derivative of the modulus function exists at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, and is equal to zero, even though its ordinary derivative does not exist at that point (due to a "sharp" turn in the curve at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;).

Note in this example both the left and right derivatives at 0 exist, but they are unequal (one is -1 and the other is 1); their average is 0, as expected.

=== ''x''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; ===&lt;!-- probably has a name, but I don't recall it--&gt;
[[File:Graphinversesqrt.png|thumb|right|Graph of y=1/x². Note the discontinuity at x=0. The function hence possesses no ordinary derivative at x=0. The symmetric derivative, however, exists for the function at x=0.]]

For the function &lt;math&gt; f(x)=1/x^2&lt;/math&gt;, we have, at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f_s(0)&amp;= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(0+h) - f(0-h)}{2h} \\
&amp;= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(h) - f(-h)}{2h} \\
&amp;= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{1/h^2 - 1/(-h)^2}{2h} \\
&amp;= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{1/h^2-1/h^2}{2h} \\
&amp;= 0, \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where again, &lt;math&gt; h&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;. Again, for this function the symmetric derivative exists at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, while its ordinary derivative does not exist at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, due to discontinuity in the curve there. Furthermore, neither the left nor the right derivative is finite at 0; i.e. this is an [[essential discontinuity]].

=== The Dirichlet function ===
The [[Dirichlet function]], defined as

&lt;math&gt;f(x) =
\begin{cases}
 1, &amp; \text{if }x\text{ is rational} \\
 0, &amp; \text{if }x\text{ is irrational}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

has symmetric derivatives &lt;math&gt; \forall x \in \mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; but not &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbb{R}-\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;; i.e. the symmetric derivative exists for rational numbers but not for irrational numbers.

== Quasi-mean value theorem ==
The symmetric derivative does not obey the usual [[mean value theorem]] (of Lagrange). As counterexample, the symmetric derivative of ''f''(''x'') = |''x''| has the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] {-1, 0, 1}, but secants for ''f'' can have a wider range of slopes; for instance, on the interval [-1, 2], the mean value theorem would mandate that there exist a point where the (symmetric) derivative takes the value &lt;math&gt;\frac{|2|-|-1|}{2-(-1)}=\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="SahooRiedel1998"/&gt;

A theorem somewhat analogous to [[Rolle's theorem]] but for the symmetric derivative was established in 1967 by C.E. Aull, who named it Quasi-Rolle theorem. If ''f'' is continuous on the closed interval [''a'', ''b''] and symmetrically differentiable on the [[open interval]] (''a'', ''b'') and ''f''(''b'') = ''f''(''a'') = 0, then there exist two points ''x'', ''y'' in  (''a'', ''b'') such that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') ≥ 0 and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') ≤ 0. A lemma also established by Aull as a stepping stone to this theorem states that if ''f'' is continuous on the closed interval [''a'', ''b''] and symmetrically differentiable on the [[open interval]] (''a'', ''b'') and additionally ''f''(''b'') &gt; ''f''(''a'') then there exist a point ''z'' in (''a'', ''b'') where the symmetric derivative is non-negative, or with the notation used above, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') ≥ 0. Analogously, if ''f''(''b'') &lt; ''f''(''a''), then there exists a point ''z'' in (''a'', ''b'') where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') ≤ 0.&lt;ref name="SahooRiedel1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Prasanna Sahoo|author2=Thomas Riedel|title=Mean Value Theorems and Functional Equations|year=1998|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-02-3544-4|pages=188–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''quasi-mean value theorem''' for a symmetrically differentiable function states that if ''f'' is continuous on the closed interval [''a'', ''b''] and symmetrically differentiable on the open interval (''a'', ''b''), then there exist ''x'', ''y'' in  (''a'', ''b'') such that

:&lt;math&gt;f_s(x) \leq \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \leq f_s(y)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="SahooRiedel1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

As an application, the quasi-mean value theorem for ''f''(''x'') = |''x''| on an interval containing 0 predicts that the slope of any [[secant line|secant]] of ''f'' is between -1 and 1.

If the symmetric derivative of ''f'' has the [[Darboux property]], then the (form of the) regular mean value theorem (of Lagrange) holds, i.e. there exists ''z'' in (''a'', ''b''):

:&lt;math&gt;f_s(z) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="SahooRiedel1998"/&gt;

As a consequence, if a function is [[continuous function|continuous]] and its symmetric derivative is also continuous (thus has the Darboux property), then the function is differentiable in the usual sense.&lt;ref name="SahooRiedel1998"/&gt;

== Generalizations ==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}

The notion generalizes to higher-order symmetric derivatives and also to ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]s.

=== The second symmetric derivative ===
It is defined as
: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)}{h^2}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="tp1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zygmund2002"/&gt;

If the (usual) [[second derivative]] exists, then the second symmetric derivative equals it.&lt;ref name="Zygmund2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Zygmund|title=Trigonometric Series|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89053-3|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second symmetric derivative may exist however even when the (ordinary) second derivative does not. As example, consider the [[sign function]] &lt;math&gt;\sgn(x)&lt;/math&gt; which is defined through

:&lt;math&gt;\sgn(x) = \begin{cases}
-1 &amp; \text{if } x &lt; 0, \\
0 &amp; \text{if } x = 0, \\
1 &amp; \text{if } x &gt; 0. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The sign function is not continuous at zero and therefore the second derivative for &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; does not exist. But the second symmetric derivative exists for &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\sgn(0+h) - 2\sgn(0) + \sgn(0-h)}{h^2} &amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{1 - 2\cdot 0 + (-1)}{h^2} \\
&amp;= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{0}{h^2} \\
&amp;= 0 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6215">In [[computer science]], '''Tornado codes''' are a class of [[erasure code]]s that support [[error correction]].  Tornado codes require a constant C more redundant blocks than the more data-efficient [[Reed–Solomon erasure code]]s, but are much faster to generate and can fix erasures faster.  Software-based implementations of tornado codes are about 100 times faster on small lengths and about 10,000 times faster on larger lengths than Reed–Solomon erasure codes.&lt;ref&gt;A digital fountain approach to reliable distribution of bulk data. http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=285243.285258&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the introduction of Tornado codes, many other similar erasure codes have emerged, most notably [[Online codes]], [[LT codes]] and [[Raptor codes]].

Tornado codes use a layered approach.  All layers except the last use an [[LDPC]] error correction code, which is fast but has a chance of failure.  The final layer uses a Reed–Solomon correction code, which is slower but is optimal in terms of failure recovery.  Tornado codes dictates how many levels, how many recovery blocks in each level, and the distribution used to generate blocks for the non-final layers.

== Overview ==
The input data is divided into blocks.  Blocks are sequences of bits that are all the same size.  Recovery data uses the same block size as the input data.  The erasure of a block (input or recovery) is detected by some other means.  (For example, a block from disk does not pass a CRC check or a network packet with a given sequence number never arrived.)

The number of recovery blocks is given by the user.  Then the number of levels is determined along with the number of blocks in each level.  The number in each level is determined by a factor B which is less than one.  If there are N input blocks, the first recovery level has B*N blocks, the second has B*B*N, the third has B*B*B*N, and so on.

All levels of recovery except the final one use an LDPC, which works by xor (exclusive-or).  Xor operates on binary values, 1s and 0s.  A xor B is 1 if A and B have different values and 0 if A and B have the same values.  If you are given result of (A xor B) and A, you can determine the value for B.  (A xor B xor A = B)   Similarly, if you are given result of (A xor B) and B, you can determine the value for A.  This extends to multiple values, so given result of (A xor B xor C xor D) and any 3 of the values, the missing value can be recovered.  

So the recovery blocks in level one are just the xor of some set of input blocks.  Similarly, the recovery blocks in level two are each the xor of some set of blocks in level one.  The blocks used in the xor are chosen randomly, without repetition.  However, the ''number'' of blocks xor'ed to make a recovery block is chosen from a very specific distribution for each level.

Since xor is a fast operation and the recovery blocks are an xor of only a subset of the blocks in the input (or at a lower recovery level), the recovery blocks can be generated quickly.

The final level is a Reed–Solomon code.  Reed–Solomon codes are optimal in terms of recovering from failures, but slow to generate and recover.  Since each level has fewer blocks than the one before, the Reed–Solomon code has a small number of recovery blocks to generate and to use in recovery.  So, even though Reed–Solomon is slow, it only has a small amount of data to handle.

During recovery, the Reed–Solomon code is recovered first.  This is guaranteed to work if the number of missing blocks in the next-to-final level is less than the present blocks in the final level.  

Going lower, the LDPC (xor) recovery level can be used to recover the level beneath it ''with high probability'' if all the recovery blocks are present and the level beneath is missing at most C' fewer blocks than the recovery level.  The algorithm for recovery is to find some recovery block that has only one of its generating set missing from the lower level.  Then the xor of the recovery block with all of the blocks that are present is equal to the missing block.

== Patent issues ==
Tornado codes are patented inside the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Mitzenmacher|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Patents US6163870 A (filed Nov 6, 1997) and US 6081909 A (filed Nov 6, 1997) describe Tornado codes, and have expired as of November 6, 2017.  Patents US6307487 B1 (filed Feb 5, 1999) and US6320520 B1 (filed Sep 17, 1999) also mention Tornado codes.  Patents are currently valid until 20 years after filing, and since '870 A and '909 A have both expired, a case can be made that tornado codes are no longer patent encumbered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31232">A '''truth table''' is a [[mathematical table]] used in [[logic]]—specifically in connection with [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], [[boolean function]]s, and [[propositional calculus]]—which sets out the functional values of logical [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]] on each of their functional arguments, that is, for each combination of values taken by their logical variables ([[Herbert Enderton|Enderton]], 2001). In particular, truth tables can be used to show whether a propositional expression is true for all legitimate input values, that is, [[Validity (logic)|logically valid]].

A truth table has one column for each input variable (for example, P and Q), and one final column showing all of the possible results of the logical operation that the table represents (for example, P XOR Q). Each row of the truth table contains one possible configuration of the input variables (for instance, P=true Q=false), and the result of the operation for those values. See the examples below for further clarification. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] is often credited with inventing the truth table in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Georg Henrik von Wright]] | title = Ludwig Wittgenstein, A Biographical Sketch | journal = The Philosophical Review | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | year = 1955 | pages = 527–545 (p. 532, note 9) | jstor = 2182631 | doi=10.2307/2182631}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it appeared at least a year earlier in a paper on propositional logic by [[Emil Leon Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Emil Post]]|title=Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions|journal=American Journal of Mathematics|date=July 1921|volume=43|issue=3|pages=163–185|jstor= 2370324|doi=10.2307/2370324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unary operations==

There are 4 unary operations:
*Always true
*Never true, unary ''[[falsum]]''
*Unary ''Identity'' 
*Unary ''negation'' 

===Logical true===
The output value is always true, regardless of the input value of p
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical True'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''T''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T ||  T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}
===Logical false===
The output value is never true: that is, always false,  regardless of the input value of p
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical False'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''F''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

===Logical identity===
[[Identity function|Logical identity]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on one [[logical value]] p, for which the output value remains p.

The truth table for the logical identity operator is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Identity'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''p''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

===Logical negation===
[[Logical negation]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on one [[logical value]], typically the value of a [[proposition]], that produces a value of ''true'' if its operand is false and a value of ''false'' if its operand is true.

The truth table for '''NOT p''' (also written as '''¬p''', '''Np''', '''Fpq''', or '''~p''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Negation'''
|-
! style="width:80px" | ''p''
! style="width:80px" | &lt;span class="texhtml"&gt;''¬p''&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}


==Binary operations==

There are 16  possible [[truth function]]s of two [[binary variable]]s:

===Truth table for all binary logical operators===
Here is an extended truth table giving definitions of all possible truth functions of two Boolean variables P and Q:&lt;ref group=note&gt;Information about notation may be found in [[Józef Maria Bocheński|Bocheński]] (1959), [[Herbert Enderton|Enderton]] (2001), and [[W. V. Quine|Quine]] (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

where

:T = true.
:F = false.
:The '''Com''' row indicates whether an operator, '''op''', is [[Commutative property|commutative]] - '''P op Q = Q op P'''.
:The '''L id''' row shows the operator's [[left identity|left identities]] if it has any - values '''I''' such that '''I op Q = Q'''.
:The '''R id''' row shows the operator's [[right identity|right identities]] if it has any - values '''I''' such that '''P op I = P'''.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The operators here with equal left and right identities (XOR, AND, XNOR, and OR) are also [[monoid#Commutative_monoid|commutative monoids]] because they are also [[Associative_property|associative]]. While this distinction may be irrelevant in a simple discussion of logic, it can be quite important in more advanced mathematics. For example, in [[category theory]] an [[enriched category]] is described as a base [[category (mathematics)|category]] enriched over a monoid, and any of these operators can be used for enrichment.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The four combinations of input values for p, q, are read by row from the table above.
The output function for each  p, q combination, can be read, by row, from the table.

'''Key:'''

The following table is oriented by column, rather than by row. There are four columns rather than four rows, to display the four combinations of p, q, as input. 

'''p''': T T F F&lt;br&gt;
'''q''': T F T F

There are 16 rows in this key, one row for each binary function of the two binary variables, p, q. For example, in row 2 of this Key, the value of [[Converse nonimplication]] ('&lt;math&gt;\nleftarrow&lt;/math&gt;') is solely T, for the column denoted by the unique combination p=F, q=T; while  in row 2, the value of that '&lt;math&gt;\nleftarrow&lt;/math&gt;' operation is F for the three remaining columns of p, q. The output row for &lt;math&gt;\nleftarrow&lt;/math&gt; is thus

2: F F T F

and the 16-row&lt;ref name=tlp5.101/&gt; key is

Logical operators can also be visualized using [[Venn diagram#Overview|Venn diagram]]s.

===Logical conjunction (AND)===
[[Logical conjunction]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if both of its operands are true.

The truth table for '''p AND q''' (also written as '''p ∧ q''', '''Kpq''', '''p &amp; q''', or '''p''' &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; '''q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Conjunction'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ∧ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

In ordinary language terms, if both ''p'' and ''q'' are true, then the conjunction ''p'' ∧ ''q'' is true.  For all other assignments of logical values to ''p'' and to ''q'' the conjunction ''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q'' is false.

It can also be said that if ''p'', then ''p'' ∧ ''q'' is ''q'', otherwise ''p'' ∧ ''q'' is ''p''.

===Logical disjunction (OR)===
[[Logical disjunction]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if at least one of its operands is true.

The truth table for '''p OR q''' (also written as '''p ∨ q''', '''Apq''', '''p || q''', or '''p + q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Disjunction'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ∨ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

Stated in English, if ''p'', then ''p'' ∨ ''q'' is ''p'', otherwise ''p'' ∨ ''q'' is ''q''.

===Logical implication===
Logical implication and the [[material conditional]] are both associated with an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, which produces a value of ''false'' if the first operand is true and the second operand is false, and  a value of ''true'' otherwise.

The truth table associated with the logical implication '''p implies q''' (symbolized as '''p&amp;nbsp;⇒&amp;nbsp;q''', or more rarely '''Cpq''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Implication'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ⇒ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

The truth table associated with the material conditional '''if p then q''' (symbolized as '''p&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Material Conditional '''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' → ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

It may also be useful to note that '''p&amp;nbsp;⇒&amp;nbsp;q''' and '''p&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;q''' are equivalent to '''¬p&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;q'''.

===Logical equality===
[[Logical equality]] (also known as biconditional) is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if both operands are false or both operands are true.

The truth table for '''p XNOR q''' (also written as '''p ↔ q''', '''Epq''', '''p = q''', or '''p ≡ q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Equality'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ↔ ''q''
|-
| T || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

So p EQ q is true if p and q have the same [[truth value]] (both true or both false), and false if they have different truth values.

===Exclusive disjunction===
[[Exclusive disjunction]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if one but not both of its operands is true.

The truth table for '''p XOR q''' (also written as '''p ⊕ q''', '''Jpq''', '''p ≠ q''', or '''p ↮ q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Exclusive Disjunction'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ⊕ ''q''
|-
| T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|}

For two propositions, '''XOR''' can also be written as (p ∧ ¬q) ∨ (¬p ∧ q).

===Logical NAND===
The [[logical NAND]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''false'' if both of its operands are true.  In other words, it produces a value of ''true'' if at least one of its operands is false.

The truth table for '''p NAND q''' (also written as '''p ↑ q''', '''Dpq''', or '''p | q''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical NAND'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ↑ ''q''
|-

It is frequently useful to express a logical operation as a compound operation, that is, as an operation that is built up or composed from other operations.  Many such compositions are possible, depending on the operations that are taken as basic or "primitive" and the operations that are taken as composite or "derivative".

In the case of logical NAND, it is clearly expressible as a compound of NOT and AND.

The negation of a conjunction: ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q''), and the disjunction of negations: (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'') can be tabulated as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q''
! style="width:15%" | ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q'')
! style="width:15%" | ¬''p''
! style="width:15%" | ¬''q''
! style="width:15%" | (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'')
|-

|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || T || T
|}

===Logical NOR===
The [[logical NOR]] is an [[logical operation|operation]] on two [[logical value]]s, typically the values of two [[proposition]]s, that produces a value of ''true'' if both of its operands are false. In other words, it produces a value of ''false'' if at least one of its operands is true. ↓ is also known as the [[Peirce arrow]] after its inventor, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], and is a [[Sole sufficient operator]].

The truth table for '''p NOR q''' (also written as '''p ↓ q''', or '''Xpq''') is as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical NOR'''
|-
! style="width:15%" | ''p''
! style="width:15%" | ''q''
! style="width:15%" | ''p'' ↓ ''q''
|-
| T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T
|}

The negation of a disjunction ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q''), and the conjunction of negations (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'') can be tabulated as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! style="width:10%" | ''p''
! style="width:10%" | ''q''
! style="width:10%" | ''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q''
! style="width:10%" | ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q'')
! style="width:10%" | ¬''p''
! style="width:10%" | ¬''q''
! style="width:10%" | (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'')
|-
| T || T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || T || T
|}

Inspection of the tabular derivations for NAND and NOR, under each assignment of logical values to the functional arguments ''p'' and ''q'', produces the identical patterns of functional values for ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;''q'') as for (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;(¬''q''), and for ¬(''p''&amp;nbsp;∨&amp;nbsp;''q'') as for (¬''p'')&amp;nbsp;∧&amp;nbsp;(¬''q'').  Thus the first and second expressions in each pair are logically equivalent, and may be substituted for each other in all contexts that pertain solely to their logical values.

This equivalence is one of [[De Morgan's laws]].

==Applications==
Truth tables can be used to prove many other [[logical equivalence]]s.  For example, consider the following truth table:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto; text-align:center;"
|+ '''Logical Equivalence : &lt;math&gt;(p \Rightarrow q) \equiv (\lnot p \lor q)&lt;/math&gt;'''
|- style="background:paleturquoise"
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;\lnot p&lt;/math&gt;
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;\lnot p \lor q&lt;/math&gt;
! style="width:12%" | &lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| T || T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || T || T
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F || style="background:papayawhip" | F || T || T || T
|}

This demonstrates the fact that &lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow q&lt;/math&gt; is [[logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;\lnot p \lor q&lt;/math&gt;.

===Truth table for most commonly used logical operators===
Here is a truth table that gives definitions of the 6 most commonly used out of [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#Propositions 4.*-5.*|the 16 possible truth functions of two Boolean variables P and Q]]:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! &lt;math&gt;P &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;Q &lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \land Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \lor Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \underline{\lor} Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \underline{\land} Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \Rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;P \Leftarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;  ||  &lt;math&gt;P \Leftrightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| T || T ||  T  ||  T  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  T  ||  T  ||  T
|-
| T || style="background:papayawhip" | F  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  T  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F 
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F  || T ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  T  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F 
|-
| style="background:papayawhip" | F  || style="background:papayawhip" | F  ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  style="background:papayawhip" | F   ||  T  ||  T  ||  T  ||  T
|}

where

:T = true
:F = false
:&lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; = [[logical conjunction|AND]] (logical conjunction)
:&lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; = [[logical disjunction|OR]] (logical disjunction)
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{\lor}&lt;/math&gt; = [[Exclusive or|XOR]] (exclusive or) &lt;!-- this could be "+" instead according to other articles --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{\land}&lt;/math&gt; = [[Exclusive nor|XNOR]] (exclusive nor)
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; = [[logical conditional|conditional "if-then"]]
:&lt;math&gt;\Leftarrow&lt;/math&gt; = conditional "then-if"
:&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; = [[if and only if|biconditional "if-and-only-if"]].

===Condensed truth tables for binary operators===
For binary operators, a condensed form of truth table is also used, where the row headings and the column headings specify the operands and the table cells specify the result. For example, [[Boolean logic]] uses this condensed truth table notation:

{|
|-
| style="width:80px;"|
|
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! ∧ || F || T
|-
! F
| F || F
|-
! T
| F || T
|}
| style="width:80px;"|
|
{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center;"
|-
! ∨ || F || T
|-
! F
| F || T
|-
! T
| T || T
|}
|}

This notation is useful especially if the operations are commutative, although one can additionally specify that the rows are the first operand and the columns are the second operand. This condensed notation is particularly useful in discussing multi-valued extensions of logic, as it significantly cuts down on combinatoric explosion of the number of rows otherwise needed. It also provides for quickly recognizable characteristic "shape" of the distribution of the values in the table which can assist the reader in grasping the rules more quickly.

===Truth tables in digital logic===
Truth tables are also used to specify the function of [[Lookup table#Hardware LUTs|hardware look-up tables (LUTs)]] in [[Digital circuit|digital logic circuitry]]. For an n-input LUT, the truth table will have 2^''n'' values (or rows in the above tabular format), completely specifying a boolean function for the LUT. By representing each boolean value as a [[bit]] in a [[Binary numeral system|binary number]], truth table values can be efficiently encoded as [[integer]] values in [[Electronic design automation|electronic design automation (EDA)]] [[software]]. For example, a 32-bit integer can encode the truth table for a LUT with up to 5 inputs.

When using an integer representation of a truth table, the output value of the LUT can be obtained by calculating a bit index ''k'' based on the input values of the LUT, in which case the LUT's output value is the ''k''th bit of the integer. For example, to evaluate the output value of a LUT given an [[Array data structure|array]] of ''n'' boolean input values, the bit index of the truth table's output value can be computed as follows: if the ''i''th input is true, let &lt;math&gt;V_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;, else let &lt;math&gt;V_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the ''k''th bit of the binary representation of the truth table is the LUT's output value, where &lt;math&gt;k = V_0 \times 2^0 + V_1 \times 2^1 + V_2 \times 2^2 + \dots + V_n \times 2^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Truth tables are a simple and straightforward way to encode boolean functions, however given the [[exponential growth]] in size as the number of inputs increase, they are not suitable for functions with a large number of inputs. Other representations which are more memory efficient are text equations and [[binary decision diagram]]s.

===Applications of truth tables in digital electronics===
In digital electronics and computer science (fields of applied logic engineering and mathematics), truth tables can be used to reduce basic boolean operations to simple correlations of inputs to outputs, without the use of [[logic gate]]s or code. For example, a binary addition can be represented with the truth table:

&lt;pre&gt;
A B | C R
1 1 | 1 0
1 0 | 0 1
0 1 | 0 1
0 0 | 0 0

where

A = First Operand
B = Second Operand
C = Carry
R = Result
&lt;/pre&gt;

This truth table is read left to right:
* Value pair (A,B) equals value pair (C,R).
* Or for this example, A plus B equal result R, with the Carry C.

Note that this table does not describe the logic operations necessary to implement this operation, rather it simply specifies the function of inputs to output values.

With respect to the result, this example may be arithmetically viewed as modulo 2 binary addition, and as logically equivalent to the exclusive-or (exclusive disjunction) binary logic operation.

In this case it can be used for only very simple inputs and outputs, such as 1s and 0s. However, if the number of types of values one can have on the inputs increases, the size of the truth table will  increase.

For instance, in an addition operation, one needs two operands, A and B. Each can have one of two values, zero or one. The number of combinations of these two values is 2×2, or four. So the result is four possible outputs of C and R.  If one were to use base 3, the size would increase to 3×3, or nine possible outputs.

The first "addition" example above is called a half-adder. A full-adder is when the carry from the previous operation is provided as input to the next adder. Thus, a truth table of eight rows would be needed to describe a [[full adder]]'s logic:

&lt;pre&gt;
A B C* | C R
0 0 0  | 0 0
0 1 0  | 0 1
1 0 0  | 0 1
1 1 0  | 1 0
0 0 1  | 0 1
0 1 1  | 1 0
1 0 1  | 1 0
1 1 1  | 1 1

Same as previous, but..
C* = Carry from previous adder
&lt;/pre&gt;

==History==
Irving Anellis has done the research to show that [[C.S. Peirce]] appears to be the earliest logician (in 1893) to devise a truth table matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anellis|first1=Irving H.|title=Peirce's Truth-functional Analysis and the Origin of the Truth Table|journal=History and Philosophy of Logic|date=2012|volume=33|pages=87–97|doi=10.1080/01445340.2011.621702}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the summary of his paper:
&lt;blockquote&gt; In 1997, John Shosky discovered, on the verso of a page of the typed transcript of Bertrand Russell's 1912 lecture on "The Philosophy of Logical Atomism" truth table matrices. The matrix for negation is Russell's, alongside of which is the matrix for material implication in the hand of Ludwig Wittgenstein. It is shown that an unpublished manuscript identified as composed by Peirce in 1893 includes a truth table matrix that is equivalent to the matrix for material implication discovered by John Shosky. An unpublished manuscript by Peirce identified as having been composed in 1883–84 in connection with the composition of Peirce's "On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation" that appeared in the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'' in 1885 includes an example of an indirect truth table for the conditional. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The minors may be formed by deleting the red vertex and contracting edges within each yellow circle.]]
[[File:Clique-sum.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|A clique-sum of two planar graphs and the Wagner graph, forming a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-free graph.]]
In [[graph theory]], '''Wagner's theorem''' is a mathematical [[forbidden graph characterization]] of [[planar graph]]s, named after [[Klaus Wagner]], stating that a finite graph is planar if and only if its [[graph minor|minors]] include neither ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;  (the [[complete graph]] on five [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]]) nor ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; (the [[utility graph]], a [[complete bipartite graph]] on six vertices). This was one of the earliest results in the theory of [[graph minor]]s and can be seen as a forerunner of the [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]].

==Definitions and theorem statement==
A planar [[graph embedding|embedding]] of a given [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is a [[graph drawing|drawing]] of the graph in the [[Euclidean plane]], with points for its [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] and curves for its [[edge (graph theory)|edges]], in such a way that the only intersections between pairs of edges are at a common endpoint of the two edges. A [[graph minor|minor]] of a given graph is another graph formed by deleting vertices, deleting edges, and contracting edges. When an edge is contracted, its two endpoints are merged to form a single vertex. In some versions of graph minor theory the graph resulting from a contraction is simplified by removing self-loops and multiple adjacencies, while in other version [[multigraph]]s are allowed, but this variation makes no difference to Wagner's theorem.
Wagner's theorem states that every graph has either a planar embedding, or a minor of one of two types, the complete graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; or the complete bipartite graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt;. (It is also possible for a single graph to have both types of minor.)

If a given graph is planar, so are all its minors: vertex and edge deletion obviously preserve planarity, and edge contraction can also be done in a planarity-preserving way, by leaving one of the two endpoints of the contracted edge in place and routing all of the edges that were incident to the other endpoint along the path of the contracted edge.
A ''minor-minimal'' non-planar graph is a graph that is not planar, but in which all proper minors (minors formed by at least one deletion or contraction) are planar. Another way of stating Wagner's theorem is that there are only two minor-minimal non-planar graphs, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Another result also sometimes known as Wagner's theorem states that a [[k-vertex-connected graph|four-connected]] graph is planar if and only if it has no ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; minor. That is, by assuming a higher level of connectivity, the graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; can be made unnecessary in the characterization, leaving only a single forbidden minor, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Correspondingly, the [[Kelmans–Seymour conjecture]] states that a 5-connected graph is planar if and only if it does not have ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; as a [[topological minor]].

==History and relation to Kuratowski's theorem==
Wagner published both theorems in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=K.|last=Wagner|authorlink=Klaus Wagner|year=1937|title=Über eine Eigenschaft der ebenen Komplexe|journal=Math. Ann.|volume=114|pages=570–590|doi=10.1007/BF01594196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; subsequent to the 1930 publication of [[Kuratowski's theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Kazimierz|last=Kuratowski|authorlink=Kazimierz Kuratowski|year=1930|url=http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm15/fm15126.pdf|title=Sur le problème des courbes gauches en topologie|journal=Fund. Math.|volume=15|pages=271–283|language=French}}.&lt;/ref&gt; according to which a graph is planar if and only if it does not contain as a subgraph a [[subdivision (graph theory)|subdivision]] of one of the same two forbidden graphs ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt;. In a sense, Kuratowski's theorem is stronger than Wagner's theorem: a subdivision can be converted into a minor of the same type by contracting all but one edge in each [[Path (graph theory)|path]] formed by the subdivision process, but converting a minor into a subdivision of the same type is not always possible. However, in the case of the two graphs ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt;, it is straightforward to prove that a graph that has at least one of these two graphs as a minor also has at least one of them as a subdivision, so the two theorems are equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Graph Theory|volume=244|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|first1=J. A.|last1=Bondy|author1-link=John Adrian Bondy|first2=U.S.R.|last2=Murty|author2-link=U. S. R. Murty|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=9781846289699|page=269|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HuDFMwZOwcsC&amp;pg=PA269}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
One consequence of the stronger version of Wagner's theorem for four-connected graphs is to characterize the graphs that do not have a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; minor. The theorem can be rephrased as stating that every such graph is either planar or it can be decomposed into simpler pieces. Using this idea, the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-minor-free graphs may be characterized as the graphs that can be formed as combinations of planar graphs and the eight-vertex [[Wagner graph]], glued together by [[clique-sum]] operations. For instance, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; can be formed in this way as a clique-sum of three planar graphs, each of which is a copy of the tetrahedral graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

Wagner's theorem is an important precursor to the theory of graph minors, which culminated in the proofs of two deep and far-reaching results: the [[graph structure theorem]] (a generalization of Wagner's clique-sum decomposition of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-minor-free graphs)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], the '''Watkins snark''' is a [[snark (graph theory)|snark]] with 50 [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] and 75 [[edge (graph theory)|edge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Watkins Snark|urlname=WatkinsSnark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, J.

As a snark, the Watkins graph is a connected, [[Bridge (graph theory)|bridgeless]] [[cubic graph]] with [[chromatic index]] equal to 4.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15104">In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[category theory]], the '''Yoneda lemma''' is an abstract result on [[functor]]s of the type ''morphisms into a fixed object''. It is a vast generalisation of [[Cayley's theorem]] from [[group theory]] (viewing a group as a particular kind of category with just one object and only isomorphisms). It allows the [[Subcategory#Embeddings|embedding]] of any category into a [[category of functors]] (contravariant set-valued functors) defined on that category. It also clarifies how the embedded category, of [[representable functor]]s and their [[natural transformation]]s, relates to the other objects in the larger functor category. It is an important tool that underlies several modern developments in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[representation theory]]. It is named after [[Nobuo Yoneda]].

==Generalities==

The Yoneda lemma suggests that instead of studying the ([[locally small]]) category &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, one should study the category of all functors of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt; (the [[category of sets]] with [[function (mathematics)|function]]s as [[morphism]]s). &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt; is a category we think we understand well, and a functor of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt; can be seen as a "representation" of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; in terms of known structures. The original category &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; is contained in this functor category, but new objects appear in the functor category, which were absent and "hidden" in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;. Treating these new objects just like the old ones often unifies and simplifies the theory.

This approach is akin to (and in fact generalizes) the common method of studying a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] by investigating the [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over that ring. The ring takes the place of the category &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, and the category of modules over the ring is a category of functors defined on &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Formal statement==

Yoneda's lemma concerns functors from a fixed category &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; to the [[category of sets]], &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; is a [[locally small category]] (i.e. the [[hom-set]]s are actual sets and not proper classes), then each object &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; gives rise to a natural functor to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt; called a [[hom-functor]]. This functor is denoted:
:&lt;math&gt;h^A = \mathrm{Hom}(A,-)&lt;/math&gt;.
The ([[Covariance and contravariance of functors|covariant]]) hom-functor &lt;math&gt; h^A &lt;/math&gt; sends &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to the set of [[morphism]]s &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Hom}(A,X) &lt;/math&gt; and sends a morphism &lt;math&gt; f \colon X \to Y &lt;/math&gt; to the morphism &lt;math&gt;f \circ -&lt;/math&gt; (composition with &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on the left) that sends a morphism &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Hom}(A,X) &lt;/math&gt; to the morphism &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Hom}(A,Y)&lt;/math&gt;. That is, 
: &lt;math&gt;h^A(f) = \mathrm{Hom}(A,f) \mbox{, or}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;h^A(f)(g) = f \circ g&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary functor from &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt;. Then Yoneda's lemma says that:

For each object &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, the [[natural transformation]]s from &lt;math&gt; h^A &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt; are in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of &lt;math&gt; F(A) &lt;/math&gt;. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Nat}(h^A,F) \cong F(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Moreover this isomorphism is natural in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; when both sides are regarded as functors from &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set}^\mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt;. (Here the notation &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set}^\mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; denotes the category of functors from &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt;.)

Given a natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt; h^A &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding element of &lt;math&gt; F(A) &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; u = \Phi_A(\mathrm{id}_A)&lt;/math&gt;;{{efn|Recall that &lt;math&gt; \Phi_A : \mathrm{Hom}(A,A) \to F(A) &lt;/math&gt; so the last expression is well-defined and sends a morphism from &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;, to an element in &lt;math&gt; F(A) &lt;/math&gt;.}} and given an element &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; F(A) &lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding natural transformation is given by &lt;math&gt;\Phi(f) = F(f)(u)&lt;/math&gt;.

There is a contravariant version of Yoneda's lemma, which concerns [[contravariant functor]]s from &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt;. This version involves the contravariant hom-functor
:&lt;math&gt;h_A = \mathrm{Hom}(-, A),&lt;/math&gt;
which sends &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; to the hom-set &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Hom}(X,A) &lt;/math&gt;. Given an arbitrary contravariant functor &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt;, Yoneda's lemma asserts that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Nat}(h_A,G) \cong G(A).&lt;/math&gt;

===Naming conventions===

The use of &lt;math&gt; h^A &lt;/math&gt; for the covariant hom-functor and &lt;math&gt;h_A&lt;/math&gt; for the contravariant hom-functor is not completely standard. Many texts and articles either use the opposite convention or completely unrelated symbols for these two functors. However, most modern algebraic geometry texts starting with [[Alexander Grothendieck|Alexander Grothendieck's]] foundational [[Éléments de géométrie algébrique|EGA]] use the convention in this article.{{efn|A notable exception to modern algebraic geometry texts following the conventions of this article is ''Commutative algebra with a view toward algebraic geometry'' / David Eisenbud (1995), which uses &lt;math&gt; h_A &lt;/math&gt; to mean the covariant hom-functor. However, the later book ''The geometry of schemes'' / David Eisenbud, Joe Harris (1998) reverses this and uses &lt;math&gt; h_A &lt;/math&gt; to mean the contravariant hom-functor.}}

The mnemonic "falling into something" can be helpful in remembering that &lt;math&gt; h_A &lt;/math&gt; is the contravariant hom-functor. When the letter &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; is '''falling''' (i.e. a subscript), &lt;math&gt; h_A &lt;/math&gt; assigns to an object &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; the morphisms from &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; '''into''' &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;.

===Proof===

The proof of Yoneda's lemma is indicated by the following [[commutative diagram]]:

[[Image:Yoneda lemma cd.svg|center|Proof of Yoneda's lemma]]

This diagram shows that the natural transformation &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt; is completely determined by &lt;math&gt;\Phi_A(\mathrm{id}_A)=u&lt;/math&gt; since for each morphism &lt;math&gt; f \colon A \to X &lt;/math&gt; one has
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_X(f) = (Ff)u&lt;/math&gt;.
Moreover, any element &lt;math&gt; u \in F(A) &lt;/math&gt; defines a natural transformation in this way. The proof in the contravariant case is completely analogous.

===The Yoneda embedding===

An important special case of Yoneda's lemma is when the functor &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt; is another hom-functor &lt;math&gt; h^B &lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the covariant version of Yoneda's lemma states that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Nat}(h^A,h^B) \cong \mathrm{Hom}(B,A).&lt;/math&gt;

That is, natural transformations between hom-functors are in one-to-one correspondence with morphisms (in the reverse direction) between the associated objects. Given a morphism &lt;math&gt; f \colon B \to A &lt;/math&gt; the associated natural transformation is denoted &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Hom}(f,-)&lt;/math&gt;.

Mapping each object &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; to its associated hom-functor &lt;math&gt; h^A  = \mathrm{Hom}(A,-) &lt;/math&gt; and each morphism &lt;math&gt; f \colon B \to A &lt;/math&gt; to the corresponding natural transformation &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Hom}(f,-) &lt;/math&gt; determines a contravariant functor &lt;math&gt;h^-&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set}^\mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, the [[functor category]] of all (covariant) functors from &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt;. One can interpret &lt;math&gt;h^-&lt;/math&gt; as a [[covariant functor]]:
:&lt;math&gt;h^{-}\colon \mathcal{C}^{\text{op}} \to \mathbf{Set}^\mathcal{C}.&lt;/math&gt;
The meaning of Yoneda's lemma in this setting is that the functor &lt;math&gt; h^- &lt;/math&gt; is [[full and faithful functors|fully faithful]], and therefore gives an embedding of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{op}} &lt;/math&gt; in the category of functors to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt;. The collection of all functors &lt;math&gt; \{h^A | A \in C\}&lt;/math&gt; is a subcategory of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set}^{\mathcal{C}} &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, Yoneda embedding implies that the category &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{op}} &lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the category &lt;math&gt;\{h^A | A \in C \}&lt;/math&gt;.

The contravariant version of Yoneda's lemma states that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Nat}(h_A,h_B) \cong \mathrm{Hom}(A,B).&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, &lt;math&gt; h_- &lt;/math&gt; gives rise to a covariant functor from &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; to the category of contravariant functors to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;h_{-}\colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathbf{Set}^{\mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{op}}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Yoneda's lemma then states that any locally small category &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; can be embedded in the category of contravariant functors from &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt; via &lt;math&gt;h_-&lt;/math&gt;. This is called the ''Yoneda embedding''.

=== Representable functor ===
{{main| Representable functor}}
The Yoneda embedding essentially states that for every (locally small) category, objects in that category can be [[Representable functor|represented]] by [[Presheaf (category theory)|presheaves]], in a full and faithful manner.  That is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Nat}(h_A,P) \cong P(A).&lt;/math&gt;
for a presheaf ''P''.  Many common categories are, in fact, pre-sheaves, and on closer inspection, prove to be [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]], and, as such examples are commonly topological in nature, they can be seen to be [[topoi]] in general. The Yoneda lemma provides a point of leverage by which the topological structure of a category can be studied and understood.

==Preadditive categories, rings and modules==
{{Main|Preadditive category}}

A ''[[preadditive category]]'' is a category where the morphism sets form [[abelian group]]s and the composition of morphisms is [[bilinear operator|bilinear]]; examples are categories of abelian groups or modules. In a preadditive category, there is both a "multiplication" and an "addition" of morphisms, which is why preadditive categories are viewed as generalizations of [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s. Rings are preadditive categories with one object.

The Yoneda lemma remains true for preadditive categories if we choose as our extension the category of ''[[additive functor|additive]]'' contravariant functors from the original category into the category of abelian groups; these are functors which are compatible with the addition of morphisms and should be thought of as forming a ''[[module category]]'' over the original category. The Yoneda lemma then yields the natural procedure to enlarge a preadditive category so that the enlarged version remains preadditive &amp;mdash; in fact, the enlarged version is an [[abelian category]], a much more powerful condition. In the case of a ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the extended category is the category of all right [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, and the statement of the Yoneda lemma reduces to the well-known isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt; M \cong \mathrm{Hom}_R(R,M)&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;for all right modules &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

== Relationship to Cayley's theorem ==
As stated above, the Yoneda lemma may be considered as a vast generalization of [[Cayley's theorem]] from [[group theory]]. To see this, let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt; be a category with a single object &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; such that every morphism is an [[isomorphism]] (i.e. a [[groupoid]] with one object). Then &lt;math&gt;G=\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(*,*)&lt;/math&gt; forms a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] under the operation of composition, and any group can be realized as a category in this way. 

In this context, a covariant functor &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C} \to \mathbf{Set} &lt;/math&gt; consists of a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and a [[group homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;G\to\mathrm{Perm}(X)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Perm}(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the group of [[Permutation|permutations]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;; in other words, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[G-set]]. A natural transformation between such functors is the same thing as an [[equivariant map]] between &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-sets: a set function &lt;math&gt;\alpha \colon X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; with the property that &lt;math&gt;\alpha(g\cdot x)=g\cdot\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. (On the left side of this equation, the &lt;math&gt; \cdot &lt;/math&gt; denotes the action of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and on the right side the action on &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.) 

Now the covariant hom-functor &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(*,-)&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the action of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on itself by left-multiplication (the contravariant version corresponds to right-multiplication). The Yoneda lemma with &lt;math&gt;F=\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(*,-)&lt;/math&gt; states that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Nat}(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(*,-),\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(*,-)) \cong \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(*,*)&lt;/math&gt;,
that is, the equivariant maps from this &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set to itself are in bijection with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. But it is easy to see that (1) these maps form a group under composition, which is a [[subgroup]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Perm}(G)&lt;/math&gt;, and (2) the function which gives the bijection is a group homomorphism. (Going in the reverse direction, it associates to every &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; the equivariant map of right-multiplication by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.) Thus &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Perm}(G)&lt;/math&gt;, which is the statement of Cayley's theorem.

==History==

Yoshiki Kinoshita stated in 1996 that the term "Yoneda lemma" was coined by [[Saunders Mac Lane]] following an interview he had with Yoneda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof. Nobuo Yoneda passed away|last=Kinoshita|first=Yoshiki|url=http://www.mta.ca/~cat-dist/catlist/1999/yoneda|accessdate=21 December 2013|date=23 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
