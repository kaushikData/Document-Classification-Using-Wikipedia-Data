'''Anilite bomb'''s, also known as '''''Gros Andreau''''' bombs, were introduced early in the [[First World War]] for dropping from aircraft.

==Description==
The Anilite bomb consisted of two compartments; one filled with gaseous [[Nitrogen Dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and another filled with [[Gasoline]] or any other suitable / available hydrocarbon to proportions of 80% NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 20% hydrocarbon as oxidiser and fuel respectively.&lt;ref name=Martel&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martel|first1=René|editor1-last=Suddaby|editor1-first=Allen|editor2-last=Gordon|editor2-first=Martin|title=French strategic and tactical bombardment forces of World War I|date=2007|publisher=The Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham (Md.)|isbn=978-0810856622|pages=103–105|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1iVPAtq56TMC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=Anilite+Bomb#v=onepage&amp;q=Anilite%20Bomb&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once released the two components mixed inside the casing becoming explosive after mixing. This gave the advantage of relatively safe handling with low risk of premature detonation, even with rough handling. If the bomb components did not mix or the gas leaked, the bomb became an incendiary device. Disadvantages included the toxicity of the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if leakage occurred, with several instances of crews being poisoned and incapacitated by leaking bombs and the relative fragile nature of the casing which meant that the bombs had none or little penetration on impact, limiting their effectiveness.&lt;ref name=Martel/&gt;

The ''Gros Andreau'' bombs were produced in three calibres:
;{{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on|2}}: weighing {{convert|10|kg|abbr=on}}, containing {{convert|6|kg|abbr=on}} of explosive.&lt;ref name=Martel/&gt;
;{{convert|155|mm|in|abbr=on|2}}: weighing {{convert|25|kg|abbr=on}}, containing {{convert|12|kg|abbr=on}} of explosive.&lt;ref name=Martel/&gt;
;{{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on|2}}: weighing {{convert|50|kg|abbr=on}}, containing {{convert|25|kg|abbr=on}} of explosive.&lt;ref name=Martel/&gt;

==Operational history==
''Gros Andreau'' bombs proved effective and relatively safe to use and were first dropped on [[Karlsruhe]] on 22 June 1916, being withdrawn from use in 1918 and replaced with bombs filled with [[Picric acid|Melinite]] (picric acid and guncotton) and [[Mononitronaphthalene]] known as [[MMN bomb]]s.&lt;ref name=Martel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sanford&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sanford|first1=P.

In electronics, two '''anti-parallel''' or '''inverse-parallel''' devices are connected in [[series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]] but with their [[electrical polarity|polarities]] reversed.

One example is the [[TRIAC]], which is comparable to two [[thyristors]] connected back-to-back (in other words, reverse parallel), but on a single piece of [[silicon]].

Two LEDs can be paired this way, so that each protects the other from [[reverse voltage]].  A series string of such pairs can be connected to AC or DC power, with an appropriate resistor.  Some two-color LEDs are constructed this way, with the 2 dies connected anti-parallel in one [[chip package]].  With AC, the LEDs in each pair take turns emitting light, on alternate half-cycles of supply power, greatly reducing the [[strobing]] effect to below the normal [[flicker fusion threshold]] of the [[human eye]], and making the lights brighter.  On DC, polarity can be switched back and forth so as to change the color of the lights, such as in [[Christmas lights]] that can be either white or colored.  

Battery-powered lights, which are wired in parallel, can also create a simulated "chasing" effect by alternating the polarity for each LED attached to the string, and controlling the positive and negative parts of the cycle separately.  This creates two "virtual circuits", with odd-numbered LEDs lighting on positive polarity and even-numbered ones on negative polarity, for example.  By eliminating the need for extra wires, this reduces costs for the manufacturer, and makes the cords less bulky and obvious for the consumer to string on decorative items.  On cheaper sets, this causes strobing and prevents any of the LEDs from getting to full brightness, since both polarities share the same wire pair and cannot be active at the same time, meaning each can only be on during its own half of the cycle.  Better lights can adjust the [[duty cycle]] so that any unused "off" time on one polarity can be used by the other, reducing the strobing effect and making it easier to create color blends (such as orange, amber, and yellow from a reg/green LED).

== ESD ==

Antiparallel diodes are often used for [[Electrostatic_discharge|ESD]] prevention in [[integrated_circuits|ICs]]. Different ground or supply domains at the same potential or voltage may be wired separately for isolation reasons. However, during an ESD event across the domains, one would want a path for the high current to traverse. Without the antiparallel diodes in place, the voltage induced by the ESD event may result in the current following an unknown path that often leads to damage of the device. With the diodes in place the current can travel in either direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17901">{{Redirects here|Franco-Arabic|the music genre|Arabic music#Franco-Arabic}}The '''Arabic chat alphabet''', also known as '''Arabish''', '''Araby''' ({{lang-ar|عربي}}, {{lang|ar-Latn|Arabī}}), '''''Arabizi'''''&lt;ref name=arabnews2011 /&gt; ({{lang|ar|عربيزي}}, {{lang|ar-Latn|Arabīzī}}), Mu'arrab ({{lang|ar|معرب}}), and '''Franco-Arabic''' ({{lang|ar|عرنسية}}),&lt;ref name=arabnews2014 /&gt; is an alphabet used to communicate in [[Arabic]] over the [[Internet]] or for sending [[SMS|messages]] via [[Mobile phone|cellular phones]]. It is a [[character encoding]] of Arabic to the [[Latin script]] and the [[Western Arabic numerals]]. It differs from more formal and academic [[Romanization of Arabic|Arabic transliteration]] systems, as it avoids [[Arabic diacritics|diacritics]] by freely using digits and [[multigraph (orthography)|multigraph]]s for letters that do not exist in the basic Latin script ([[ASCII]]).&lt;ref name="PalfreymanKhalil"/&gt;

The Arabic chat alphabet is used to communicate in Arabic over the Internet or for sending messages via cellular phones when the [[Arabic alphabet]] is unavailable or difficult to use for technical reasons.&lt;ref name="Yaghan"/&gt;  Arabish is most commonly used by [[youth in the Arab world|youth]] in the [[Arab world]] in very informal settings, such as when communicating with friends or other young people.&lt;ref name="PalfreymanKhalil"/&gt;

Because of its widespread use, including in public advertisements by large multinational companies, large players in the online industry like [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] have introduced tools that convert text written in Arabish to Arabic. Add-ons for Mozilla Firefox and Chrome also exist. The Arabic chat alphabet is never used in formal settings and is rarely, if ever, used for long communications.&lt;ref name=Yaghan /&gt;

== History ==
During the last decades of the 20th century, Western text-based communication technologies, such as [[Text messaging|mobile phone text messaging]], the [[World Wide Web]], [[email]], [[bulletin board system]]s, [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], and [[instant messaging]] became increasingly prevalent in the [[Arab world]]. Most of these technologies originally permitted the use of the Latin script only, and some still lack support for displaying [[Arabic script]]. As a result, Arabic-speaking users frequently transliterate Arabic text into Latin script when using these technologies to communicate.

To handle those Arabic letters that do not have an approximate [[Phonetics|phonetic]] equivalent in the Latin script, numerals and other characters were appropriated. For example, the numeral "3" is used to represent the Arabic letter {{angbr|{{lang|ar|[[ع]]}}}} (''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿayn}}'')—note the choice of a visually similar character, with the numeral resembling a mirrored version of the Arabic letter. Many users of mobile phones and computers use Arabish even though their system is capable of displaying Arabic script. This may be due to a lack of an appropriate [[Arabic keyboard|keyboard layout for Arabic]], or because users are already more familiar with the [[QWERTY]] [[keyboard layout]].

Online [[communication]] systems, such as IRC, bulletin board systems, and [[blog]]s, are often run on systems or over protocols which do not support [[code page]]s or alternate character sets. Thus, the Arabic chat alphabet has become commonplace. It can be seen even in [[domain name]]s, like [[Qal3ah]].

Conservative Muslims, as well as [[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arabists]] and some [[Arab nationalism|Arab-nationalists]], have viewed Arabish as a detrimental form of [[Westernization]]. Arabish emerged amid a growing trend among [[Arabs|Arab]] youth, especially in [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]], to incorporate English into Arabic as a form of slang. Arabish is used to replace Arabic script, and this has raised concerns regarding the preservation of the quality of the language.&lt;ref name=arabnews2014 /&gt;

{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2018}}
{{original research|section|date=May 2018}}
Because of the informal nature of this system, there is no single "correct" or "official" usage. There may be some overlap in the way various letters are transliterated.

Most of the characters in the system make use of the Latin character (as used in English and French) that best approximates phonetically the Arabic letter that one would otherwise use (for example, {{lang|ar|[[ب]]}} corresponds to ''b''). [[Varieties of Arabic|Regional variations]] in the pronunciation of an Arabic letter can also produce some variation in its transliteration (e.g. {{lang|ar|[[ﺝ]]}} might be transliterated as ''j'' by a speaker of the [[Levantine Arabic|Levantine dialect]], or as ''g'' by a speaker of the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian dialect]]).

Those letters that do not have a close phonetic approximation in the Latin script are often expressed using numerals or other characters, so that the numeral graphically approximates the Arabic letter that one would otherwise use (e.g. {{lang|ar|[[ع]]}} is represented using the numeral ''3'' because the latter looks like a horizontal [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] of the former).

Since many letters are distinguished from others solely by a dot above or below the main portion of the character, the transliterations of these letters frequently use the same letter or number with an [[apostrophe]] added before or after (e.g. '''3'' is used to represent {{lang|ar|[[غ]]}}).

== Criticism ==
{{see also|Arabic language#Arabic and Islam}}

Conservative Muslims, as well as [[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arabists]] and some [[Arab nationalism|Arab-nationalists]], view Arabish as a detrimental form of [[Westernization]]. Arabish emerged amid a growing trend among [[Arab world|Arab]] youth, especially in [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]], to incorporate English into Arabic as a form of slang. Arabish is used to replace Arabic script, and this raises concerns regarding the preservation of the quality of the language.&lt;ref name=arabnews2014 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2243">'''Armstrong's mixture''' is a highly sensitive [[explosive material|primary explosive]]. Its primary ingredients are red [[phosphorus]] and strong oxidizer, such as [[potassium chlorate]] and [[potassium perchlorate]]. [[Sulfur]] is used to substitute for some or all of the phosphorus to slightly decrease sensitivity and lower costs; [[calcium carbonate]] may also be present in small proportions. Commercially, Armstrong's mixture is used in milligram quantities on the paper caps in toy [[cap gun]]s&lt;ref name="calvert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/bang.htm |title=Flash!

An improvised version can be made with match-heads, ground up into a fine powder, and mixed with another fine powder, this time made of the striker strip found on the side of match boxes.

It has also been considered a suitable mixture for the primer used in [[gun]]s after [[boron carbide]] has been added, and was used during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|number=3973502|y=1976|m=08|d=10|inventor=Charles R Olsen|title=Tube primer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety considerations ==
Because of its sensitivity to shock, friction and flame, Armstrong's mixture is an extremely dangerous explosive. Only about 10 mg of it is used per item of consumer fireworks. Depending on composition, conditions and quantity, Armstrong's mixture can explode violently in an enclosed space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeinfosociety.com/pdfs/science/impactfirecrackers.pdf|title=Impact Firecrackers|author=John Donner|accessdate=2006-11-11|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to extreme sensitivity to friction, mixing dry potassium chlorate and red phosphorus will most likely lead to an explosion, hence the ingredients are usually combined in a slurry with water, formed into the final product (for example, single drops onto paper for "paper caps") and allowed to dry.

An '''atmospheric satellite''' (United States usage, abbreviated '''atmosat''') or '''pseudo-satellite''' (British usage) is an [[aircraft]] that operates in the atmosphere at high altitudes for extended periods of time, in order to provide services conventionally provided by an [[artificial satellite]] orbiting in space.

Atmospheric satellites remain aloft through atmospheric lift, either [[aerostat]]ic (e.g., [[balloon (aeronautics)|balloons]]) or [[lift (force)|aerodynamic]] (e.g., [[airplane]]s). By contrast, conventional satellites in [[Earth orbit]] operate in the vacuum of space and remain in flight through [[centrifugal force]] derived from their orbital speed.

To date, all atmosats have been [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs).

==Design principles==

===Overview===
An atmosat remains aloft through atmospheric lift, in contrast to an artificial satellite in [[Earth orbit]] which remains aloft through [[centrifugal force]] derived from its high orbital speed. Because of this high speed a satellite must operate in the vacuum of space, is expensive to build and launch, and its path is inflexible once launched. Atmospheric satellites fly much slower and are intended to provide a range of services more economically and with more versatility than current [[low earth orbit|low Earth orbit]] satellites.&lt;ref name=TechCrunch20140304/&gt;

Operating altitudes are expected to be in the [[tropopause]]—at approximately 65,000 feet—where winds are generally less than 5 knots and clouds do not block sunlight.&lt;ref name=Fortune20130823&gt;{{cite web|last=Dillow |first=Clay |title=The drone that may never have to land |url=http://fortune.com/2013/08/23/the-drone-that-may-never-have-to-land/ |publisher=''Fortune'' (CNN) |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Nx5VDQKZ?url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/08/23/solara-drone/ |archivedate=March 9, 2014 |date=August 23, 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is desirable in the United States to operate above 60,000 feet, above which the Federal Aviation Administration does not regulate the airspace.&lt;ref name=Fortune20130823/&gt;

There are two classes of atmosat, respectively gaining their lift through either [[aerostat]]ic (e.g., [[balloon (aeronautics)|balloons]]) or [[lift (force)|aerodynamic]] (e.g., [[airplane]]s) forces. In order to remain aloft for long periods, the NASA and Titan Aerospace designs use propeller-driven [[electric airplane]]s powered by [[solar cell]]s, in contrast to [[Google]]'s [[Project Loon]] which envisions using helium-filled [[high-altitude balloon]]s.&lt;ref name=TechCrunch20140304/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/video/solar-powered-drones-to-provide-platform-for-googles-internet-ambitions/?&amp;WT.mc_id=SA_DD_20140423 Google Buys Solar-Powered Drones to Expand Internet Access, Accessed April 22, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balloons===
{{Main|Geostationary balloon satellite}}
[[File:Google Loon Balloon close up.jpg|thumb|A Google [[Project Loon]] balloon]]

A '''geostationary balloon satellite''' (GBS) flies in the [[stratosphere]] ({{convert|60,000|to|70,000|ft|km}} above sea level) at a fixed point over the Earth's surface. At that altitude the air has 1/10 of its [[air density|density]] is at [[sea level]]. The average wind speed at these altitudes is less than that at the surface.{{citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=Is it?}}

A GBS could be used to provide [[broadband Internet access]] over a large area.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore"&gt;{{cite web|title=A low cost alternative for satellites- tethered ultra-high altitude balloons|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5966806&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5966806|publisher=ieeexplore.ieee.org|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=books-google&gt;{{cite book|author=Chong-Hung Zee|title=Theory of Geostationary Satellites|chapter=The Use of Balloons for Physics and Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uDDWjN4DtawC&amp;pg=PA166|year=1989|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-90-277-2636-0|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=noaasis&gt;{{cite web|title=NOAA's Geostationary and Polar-Orbiting Weather Satellites|url=http://noaasis.noaa.gov/NOAASIS/ml/genlsatl.html|publisher=noaasis.noaa.gov|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One current project is the [[Google]]'s [[Project Loon]], which envisions using helium-filled [[high-altitude balloon]]s.

==Applications== &lt;!-- Let's keep it brief and specific to the atmosat CONCEPT — not UAVs in general and NOT too many details of specific atmosats that have their own articles --&gt;

A '''battery tester''' is an electronic device intended for testing the state of an electric [[Battery (electricity)|battery]], going from a simple device for testing the [[Battery charger#Charge rate|charge]] actually present in the cells and/or its voltage output, to a more comprehensive testing of the battery's condition, namely its capacity for accumulating charge and any possible flaws affecting the battery's performance and security.

== Simple battery testers ==
The most simple battery tester is a DC [[ammeter]], that indicates the battery's [[Battery charger#C-rates|charge rate]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TmlfcizaTE0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA51&amp;dq=battery+tester&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wB7nUuviK4mD2gX91YHQDQ&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=battery%20tester&amp;f=false Classroom Manual - Ken Pickerill - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
DC [[voltmeter]]s can be used to estimate the charge rate of a battery, provided that its nominal voltage is known.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LmIjpZLQQUEC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=battery+tester&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8RznUtPQEIHM2QXct4DgDg&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=battery%20tester&amp;f=false Popular Photography - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integrated battery testers ==
There are many types of integrated battery testers, each one corresponding to a specific condition testing procedure, according to the type of battery being tested, such as the “421” test for [[Lead-acid battery|lead-acid]] [[Automotive battery|vehicle batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amperis.com/en/resources/articles/meters-battery-testers/ Meters and battery testers | Amperis - Tests &amp; measurement electrical instruments&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Their common principle is based on the empirical fact that after having applied a given current for a given number of seconds to the battery, the resulting voltage output is related to the battery's overall condition, when compared to a healthy battery's output.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B5UB34Dm3P0C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=battery+tester&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6x_nUunHKsTn2wX-roCwDw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwADgo#v=onepage&amp;q=battery%20tester&amp;f=false Classic Car Electrics: Tips, Techniques and Step-by-Step Repair, Restoration ... - Martin Thaddeus - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

New [[classes of computers]] create new applications resulting in new markets and new industries.

Bell considers the law to be partially a corollary to [[Moore's law]] which states "the number of transistors per chip double every 24 months".  Unlike Moore's law, a new computer class is usually based on ''lower cost components'' that have fewer transistors or less bits on a magnetic surface, etc. A new class forms about every decade. It also takes up to a decade to understand how the class formed, evolved, and is likely to continue. Once formed, a lower priced class may evolve in performance to take over and disrupt an existing class. This evolution has caused [[computer cluster|cluster]]s of scalable [[personal computer]]s with 1 to thousands of computers to span a price and performance range of use from a PC, through [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]], to become the largest [[supercomputers]] of the day.  Scalable clusters became a universal class beginning in the mid-1990s; by 2010, clusters of at least one million independent computers will constitute the world's largest cluster.

:Definition: '''Roughly every decade a new, lower priced computer class forms based on a new programming platform, network, and interface resulting in new usage and the establishment of a new industry.
'''
Established market class computers aka platforms are introduced and continue to evolve at roughly a constant price (subject to learning curve cost reduction) with increasing functionality (or performance) based on Moore's law that gives more transistors per chip, more bits per unit area, or increased functionality per system.  Roughly every decade, technology advances in semiconductors, storage, networks, and interfaces enable a new, lower cost computer class aka platform to form to serve a new need that is enabled by smaller devices e.g. less transistors per chip, less expensive storage, displays, i/o, network, and unique interface to people or some other information processing sink or source. Each new lower priced class is then established and maintained as a quasi independent industry and market.  Such a class is likely to evolve to substitute for an existing class or classes as described above with computer clusters.

Beginning in the 1990s, a single class of scalable computers or mega-servers, (built from clusters of a few to tens of thousands of commodity microcomputer-storage-networked bricks), began to cover and replace mainframes, minis, and workstations to become the largest computers of the day, and when applied for scientific calculation they are commonly called a supercomputer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bell |first=G. |title=Bell's Law |date= |work=Microsoft Research Technical Report |id=MSR-2007-TR-146 |url=https://gordonbell.azurewebsites.net/Bell%27s_Law_MSR-2007-TR-146a.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bell's law of computer classes and class formation was first mentioned in 1970 with the introduction of the Digital Equipment PDP-11 mini to differentiate it from mainframes and the potentially emerging micros. The law was described in 1972 by [[Gordon Bell]]. The emergence and observation of a new, lower-priced microcomputer class based on the microprocessor stimulated the creation of the law that Bell described in articles and Bell's books.

==Other computer industry laws==

'''Bohunician''' industry was a [[paleolithic]] [[archeological industry]] in South-Central and East Europe. The earliest artifacts assigned to this culture are dated using [[radiocarbon dating]] at 48,000 BP. Which may make the earliest presence of modern humans in Europe predating [[Aurignacian]]. Bohunician assemblages are considered similar to [[Emiran]] and [[Ahmarian]] ones and Bohunician culture may be linked to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/38/16040 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0903446106| pmid=19571003| pmc=2752585| title=The spread of modern humans in Europe| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume=106| issue=38| pages=16040–16045| year=2009| last1=Hoffecker| first1=J.

==Premise==
The premise of the show is an alliance between [[forensic anthropologist]] [[Temperance "Bones" Brennan|Dr. Temperance "Bones" Brennan]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent [[Seeley Booth]]. Brennan is the central character and team leader of the fictional Jeffersonian Institute Medico-Legal Lab, a federal institution that collaborates with the FBI. This reflects the historic relationship between the FBI and scientists of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. Set in [[Washington, D.C.]], the show revolves around solving Federal legal cases by examining the human remains of possible murder victims. Dr. Brennan and her team provide scientific expertise and Special Agent Seeley Booth provides FBI criminal investigation technique. In addition to the prospective murder cases featured in each episode, the series explores the backgrounds and relationships of its characters. An important ongoing dynamic between Brennan and Booth is their disagreement about science and faith. Brennan argues for science, [[scientific method|evidence]], and [[atheism]]. Booth argues for intuition, [[faith]], and God. The series is known for its dark comedic undertones, featuring human bodies in advanced state of decay, which serve to lighten the gravity of the show's intense subject matter.

[[File:Bones cast.jpg|thumb|''Bones'' cast (from left): Tamara Taylor, David Boreanaz, Michaela Conlin, John Francis Daley]]

===Main cast===
* [[Emily Deschanel]] as Dr. [[Temperance "Bones" Brennan]]: A brilliant [[forensic anthropologist]] working at the renowned Jeffersonian Institute located in [[Washington, D.C.]] Her birth name was Joy Keenan, which her parents changed after they turned away from a life of crime. She is an [[empiricist]] and author of [[crime fiction]] drawn from her experiences. She is agnostic and a staunch believer in facts and evidence, to the exclusion of feelings; consequently, she comes off as distant and detached. She has shown empathy and compassion. Her dearth of social skills provides most of the show's lighthearted humor, primarily through her catchphrase, "I don't know what that means," whenever a [[popular culture|pop culture]] reference is introduced into conversation. She is noted to have a high IQ and impressive reasoning skills. She and her FBI partner, Seeley Booth, begin a relationship near the end of season six and in season seven have a daughter together whom they name Christine, in honor of Temperance's late mother. They marry in season nine. Their son, Hank, named for Booth's paternal grandfather, is born in season 11. 
* [[David Boreanaz]] as [[Seeley Booth]]: [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special agent|Special Agent]] Booth seeks out Brennan's professional help in his investigations involving human remains that cannot be identified without her skills. His character is often used as an [[audience surrogate]] to provide a layman's translation of the scientific jargon-filled dialog, especially in the "squints" conversations, or lab scenes. He gives Brennan her nickname, "Bones", which she first hates but comes to accept. He is a skilled investigator and interrogator who often relies on his "gut" and "cop instincts" (a quality unknown to Brennan). A decorated veteran of the [[United States Army Rangers]], where he was a [[sniper]], Booth has a son Parker from a previous relationship, and a younger brother, Jared. He has two children with Brennan: a daughter Christine and a son Hank. Raised in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church, Booth is a devout believer in God and heaven. He frequently debates spiritual issues with Brennan, who regards all religion as primitive superstition unsupported by empirical evidence. He is purportedly a member of the well-known [[Booth Family]] and, as such, is related to assassin [[John Wilkes Booth]].
* [[Michaela Conlin]] as [[Angela Montenegro]]: A [[forensic artist]] at the Jeffersonian Institute and Brennan's best friend, Montenegro is also her team specialist in [[forensic facial reconstruction]]—helping to [[body identification|identify the victims]]. She also can generate holograms using her three-dimensional graphics program (The Angelator and later The Angelatron) to simulate various scenarios of a crime to help determine cause of death. She and Dr. Brennan are best friends and rarely argue. She is open, friendly, and caring, and repeatedly tries to draw Brennan out of the lab. Angela's father is played by [[Billy Gibbons]], guitarist of [[ZZ Top]], who guest stars as a fictional version of himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Man In The Fallout Shelter|publisher=Fox Broadcasting Company|url=http://www.fox.com/bones/recaps/season-1/episode-09|accessdate=February 2, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728064637/http://www.fox.com/bones/recaps/season-1/episode-09|archivedate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In season five, Montenegro marries co-worker [[Jack Hodgins (Bones)|Dr. Jack Hodgins]]. They have an on-and-off relationship starting from season 2, and she gives birth to their son, Michael Vincent, in season six. Her birth name is Pookie Noodlin, as revealed in the tenth season.
* [[T. J. Thyne]] as [[Jack Hodgins (Bones)|Dr. Jack Hodgins]]: An [[Entomology|entomologist]] who is also an expert on [[spore]]s and [[mineral]]s, but whose [[hobby]] is [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. Hodgins regularly identifies as the lab's "bug and slime guy". During an investigation, he primarily deals with [[particulate]]s and [[trace evidence]] and, at the crime scene, will provide Booth with approximate time of death. He is best friends with former co-worker [[Zack Addy]] and often tries to "educate" him on [[social norm]]s. They often compete for the title of "King of the Lab", referring to whoever has more useful information in the investigations. His family is extremely wealthy and is a major sponsor of the Jeffersonian however, Hodgins tries to keep this concealed from his colleagues. It eventually comes out during an investigation, but no one allows his family's wealth to significantly affect their relationship with him. He later loses all his wealth due to the scheming of serial killer Christopher Pelant, but he eventually regains a considerable portion of it. He sells a hot sauce he develops in collaboration with intern Finn Abernathy; later he develops a non-breakable beaker, and a polymer floor mat. He marries Angela Montenegro in season five. She gives birth to their son, Michael Vincent, in season six. In season 11, Hodgins is wounded in a bomb attack and left paralyzed from the waist down. At the conclusion of the series, Hodgins is promoted to temporary head of the Jeffersonian while Cam and Arastoo are on leave after their wedding. 
* [[Eric Millegan]] as [[Zack Addy|Dr. Zack Addy]] (seasons 1–3; guest star, seasons 4–5, 11–12): Introduced in season one as Dr. Brennan's graduate student and intern, in season two, he receives his [[doctorate]]s in Forensic Anthropology and Applied Engineering, and joins the staff of the Jeffersonian as a full-fledged professional. Like Brennan, his inability to pick up on Booth's, Hodgins', or Montenegro's pop culture jokes and references is a running gag and a source of humorously awkward moments in the lab, though he has shown he has other "normal" interests such as being a [[basketball]] fan and being a trained singer. A recurring element in the show involves Zack and Hodgins amicably but resolutely competing to be "King of the Lab." In "The Pain in the Heart", a trophy presented to him by Dr. Saroyan, recognizing Zack as "King of the Lab", is revealed. Zack is removed from his position on Brennan's team in the season three finale, "The Pain in the Heart", when he is revealed to be the apprentice of the serial killer [[Gormogon (Bones)|Gormogon]]. He was residing in a psychiatric facility after pleading insanity to avoid a prison term, as Hodgins told him he "would not do well" in the general prison population. At the end of season 11, Zach escapes the facility after being suspected of being another serial killer called "The Puppeteer." At the beginning of season 12, Zach is exonerated when his doctor is proven to be the killer instead and he confesses his innocence in the Gormogon murders to Booth and Brennan. A major storyline in season 12 is exonerating Zach. In the penultimate episode "A Day in the Life," Zach is exonerated of murder thanks to Hodgins with help from Brennan and Caroline Julian at his hearing. However, the judge rules that he must finish out the last thirteen months on his sentence for the separate crime of aiding a known killer and Zach remains institutionalized, albeit with a release date just over a year away.
* [[Jonathan Adams (American actor)|Jonathan Adams]] as [[List of Bones characters#Daniel Goodman|Dr. Daniel Goodman]] (season 1): An [[archaeology|archaeologist]] turned administrator, who is the director of the Jeffersonian Institute. He is a loving husband and father to a pair of five-year-old twin girls. His way of working leads Hodgins to think of him as [[Subjectivity|subjective]], long-winded, and lacking the qualities of a pure scientist, although the antagonism between the two develops into a friendly rivalry as the season progresses. He has not made any appearances beyond season one. As of episode 23, "The Titan on the Tracks", he is said to be on [[sabbatical]], and is never seen for the rest of the series.
* [[Tamara Taylor]] as [[List of Bones characters#Camille Saroyan|Dr. Camille Saroyan]] (seasons 2–12): Succeeds Dr. Goodman as the head of the Forensic Division at Jeffersonian Institute and is a [[pathologist]]. She was a coroner in New York City. Dr. Saroyan had a romantic relationship with Booth prior to her joining the Jeffersonian and a brief relationship during the show. At first, she and Dr. Brennan have an uneasy working relationship, but she grows to be an integral member of the Jeffersonian team. Since season four, she has had a teenage adopted daughter, Michelle, because of her prior relationship with Michelle's murdered father. Later in the series, she becomes romantically involved with intern Arastoo Vaziri and they get married in series' penultimate episode "The Day in the Life", taking a sabbatical after the final case is concluded.
* [[John Francis Daley]] as [[Lance Sweets|Dr. Lance Sweets]] (seasons 3–10): An FBI [[psychologist]] assigned to Booth and Brennan after Booth arrests her father. He is frequently consulted to provide a profile on the suspects and victims involved and to give a more "humanized" perspective on the case. Due to his age, he is initially treated by Booth and the Jeffersonian team in a condescending manner, but eventually earns their respect, and their friendship. He is even accepted by Brennan, who notably dismisses psychology as a "soft science", and he is often sought out for advice by the team. In the season ten premiere, it is revealed that he and Daisy are expecting a baby. Soon after, he is fatally assaulted while serving a warrant. He dies with Booth and Brennan by his side.
* [[John Boyd (actor)|John Boyd]] as [[List of Bones characters#James Aubrey|James Aubrey]] (seasons 10–12), a junior FBI agent working under Booth. Originally, Aubrey tries to win Booth's approval and trust, as Booth is reluctant due to Aubrey's inexperience, however he is eventually accepted by Booth and the rest of the team. Aubrey gets along with everyone and his love of food is often joked about. When he was a child, his father was an investment broker who cheated his clients and fled the country, abandoning Aubrey and his mother and leaving them with nothing. In season 11, it is found out that Aubrey's father is back in the country. In season 12, Aubrey is finally approached by his father who asks him for money and even reveals he has another wife and young son back in the country he had fled to, so as to persuade Aubrey to give him financial aid. However, Aubrey realises it is all a lie and eventually calls the Feds on his father. Near the end of season 12, Aubrey is offered a promotion to Supervisory Special Agent in Los Angeles. Though Aubrey originally takes the Los Angeles job, he instead decides to take a similar position in Washington, D.C. in the series finale.

===Recurring cast===
* [[Patricia Belcher]] as [[List of Bones characters#Caroline_Julian|Caroline Julian]] (seasons 1–12): Caroline is the acerbic, witty, and often meddlesome [[United States Attorney|Assistant U.S. Attorney]] (A.U.S.A.) from the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]. She is a friend of Booth and is always willing, if not eager, to help him and his partner in their cases.
* [[Ryan O'Neal]] as Max Brennan (seasons 2–12): Max Keenan, a.k.a. Max Brennan, is the father of Russ and Temperance Brennan. He and his wife were nonviolent bank robbers who became involved with gangs in the 1970s. They changed identities to lead an honest life with their children. Booth arrests Max on murder charges in season two, and he is tried in season three. The jury finds him not guilty on all counts and he is released, finally able to reconnect openly with his children. During season 12, he passes away while protecting his grandchildren. 
* [[Loren Dean]] as Russ Brennan (seasons 1–3): Russ Brennan, a.k.a. Kyle Keenan, is the older brother of Temperance Brennan, a.k.a. Joy Keenan, and the son of Max Keenan. Russ has a troubled past and has spent some time in prison. He is involved with a woman named Amy Hollister and loves her two daughters, Emma and Hayley. After he and Temperance were abandoned by their parents, he also abandoned his sister, which led to long-held animosity from her. He first appears in the season one finale, where he patches things up with his sister and also re-unites with his father in season two. His last appearance is in season three, although he is mentioned in later seasons.
* [[Eugene Byrd]] as Dr. Clark Edison (seasons 3–12): He is the most serious and professional of the Jeffersonian interns, as well as the most organized. At the beginning of season eight, Cam hires Clark as a forensic anthropologist, to focus on archaeological work.
* [[Brendan Fehr]] as Jared Booth (seasons 4–5): Jared is Agent Seeley Booth's younger brother who is notoriously getting into trouble. However, in a continuing "Gravedigger" episode, Jared uses his military contacts to help save his brother's life. In seasons four and five, his appearances are troublesome to his older brother, especially when he announces his engagement to a former escort, whom he later divorces. In season eleven, the trend continues, but this time with a much more dire outcome as Jared is the newest victim for the Jeffersonian and it takes detached forensic work on Brennan's part to discover that his remains are not those of Seeley Booth.
* [[Michael Grant Terry]] as Wendell Bray (seasons 4–12): He is Dr. Brennan's top scholarship intern. He dates Angela briefly during season five. In season nine, he is diagnosed with [[Ewing's sarcoma]] by Brennan after breaking his arm during a hockey game. After seeking treatment, he appears to be in full remission and continues to work at the lab. In late season 12, after Wendell has trouble writing his thesis, Brennan helps him realize that his passion is not forensic anthropology after all. By the end of the series, Wendell intends to leave the Jeffersonian to find his true passion.
* [[Carla Gallo]] as Daisy Wick (seasons 4–12): Over-eager and somewhat manipulative, she is often annoying to other workers at the Jeffersonian. She has an [[on-again, off-again relationship]] with Lance Sweets. Sweets also happens to help Daisy and the others in the lab get along with each other. They later have a son named Seeley Lance Wick-Sweets, born some months after his father's death.
* [[Joel David Moore]] as Colin Fisher (seasons 4–12): Fisher suffers from depression and has a very dark sense of humor. He sometimes spends time at mental health facilities for treatment and therefore is the intern least often shown working in the lab.
* [[Pej Vahdat]] as Arastoo Vaziri (seasons 4–12): Arastoo starts out by having a fake Iranian accent, so he does not have to constantly explain his Islamic beliefs, but later drops it. He starts dating Cam in season eight; they become engaged in Season 11 and get married in Season 12.
* [[Ryan Cartwright]] as Vincent Nigel-Murray (seasons 4–6): Vincent is an Englishman and a graduate of the [[University of Leeds]]. He has a habit of reciting trivia while working. In season six, he is fatally shot in the chest by sniper Jacob Broadsky. However his death ends up being the catalyst in Booth and Brennan's relationship. Hodgins and Angela name their son's second middle name after him.
* [[Luke Kleintank]] as Finn Abernathy (seasons 7–9): Finn is the youngest intern to date and has a messy background which includes a stay at the Juvenile Detention Center. He is from [[North Carolina]] and has a thick [[Southern American English|southern accent]], which leads Hodgins to call him "[[Opie Taylor|Opie]]". Finn, in turn, calls Hodgins, who is from a very wealthy family, "[[Thurston Howell|Thurston]]". He and Hodgins go into business together to originally recreate and later sell hot sauce that Abernathy's grandmother made before she died. He and Cam's daughter fall in love and begin dating, initially behind her mother's back. She later breaks up with him after moving away to college, realizing that the distance and new developments in their lives have caused them to drift apart.
* [[Brian Klugman]] as Dr. Oliver Wells (seasons 8–11): Oliver is a lab assistant who boasts of his 160 IQ and is considerably arrogant. He has multiple doctorates in various subjects and is the only intern who is a doctor. He struggles to get along with all of the lab members due to his arrogance. He and Dr. Brennan do not enjoy the best of working relationships, especially after he tells her that he aims to surpass her reputation. A [[polymath]], he has a wide, if indolent, range of interests, from physics to psychology. He appears to bond with Hodgins later in the series, and with the rest of the team, to a certain extent.
* [[Laura Spencer (actress)|Laura Spencer]] as Jessica Warren (seasons 9–12): Jessica Warren grew up in an educational cooperative. She has five older brothers and she graduated from Michigan State University top of her class at the age of 19. She desires creativity in science, which contrasts with Brennan's insistence upon no speculation. She believes in trusting her gut. She is somewhat outspoken. In season 9, she first appears in the episode "The Drama in the Queen". At the end of the episode she has a one-night stand with Sweets. In season 11, she engages in a relationship with FBI agent James Aubrey, which ends in Season 12.
* [[Ignacio Serricchio]] as Dr. Rodolfo Fuentes (seasons 9–12): Rodolfo is a Cuban forensic anthropologist seeking asylum in the U.S. While he was already a qualified forensic anthropologist back in Cuba, he is working towards the same qualifications in America. He's also a shameless flirt, and has openly flirted with Angela and with Dr. Brennan, both of whom are married. Though Angela was flattered by his actions, both women turned down his advances. Despite his flirting habits, Hodgins takes him under his wing and becomes a good friend to him. He carries his father's prayer beads with him, despite not believing in God, because he believes that you need to experience a little bit of everything to make good life decisions. While starting as an intern, Fuentes eventually gets his doctorate and joins the Jeffersonian staff in season 12.
* [[Sara Rue]] as Karen Delfs (seasons 11–12), a flaky behavioral analyst assigned to help Booth and Bones on a case. She asked Agent Aubrey out, but he was seeing Jessica Warren at the time. She transferred to Kansas after a few episodes, but she returned in the first episode of Season 12 after being sexually harassed at her other job by her married boss. She was accused of being the one out to kill Bones (she had the requisite psychological skills to be the one), but was cleared when they discovered the real killer. In the second to last episode, Aubrey got falling down drunk at Cam and Arastoo’s wedding reception. Karen had Jessica bring him to her apartment to recover since it was closer to the reception hall. In final episode, she learned that Aubrey and Jessica broke up. She bought him some fried chicken and they went off to eat comfort food and commiserate. The implication was that they were on the verge of starting a relationship.
* [[Billy Gibbons]] as Angela Montenegro's father (seasons 1–10): The character is a fictionalized version of Gibbons himself &amp;ndash; a bearded guitarist in a famous rock band that plays sold-out stadium shows &amp;ndash; but despite all the knowing winks to him being Gibbons, the character is never named, only referred to in dialogue as “Angela’s father”, “Dad”, “my father”.

==Production==

===Conception===
The concept of ''Bones'' was developed during the latter part of the pitching season of 2004 when 20th Century Fox approached series creator Hart Hanson with an idea for a forensics show. Hanson was asked to meet with executive producer Barry Josephson, who had purchased the rights to produce a documentary on the [[forensic anthropologist]] and author [[Kathy Reichs]]. Although Hanson was reluctant about being involved in making a [[police procedural]], he signed on and wrote the pilot episode after having an intensive meeting with Josephson about the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wild|first=Diane Kristine|title=Q&amp;A: Bones Creator Hart Hanson|url=http://unifiedtheorynothingmuch.blogspot.com/2006/01/qa-bones-creator-hart-hanson.html|publisher=Unified Theory of Nothing Much|date=January 17, 2006|accessdate=May 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the show is based on the works of Reichs, the writers constantly involve her in the process of producing the episodes' story lines. Although the show's main character is also loosely based on Reichs, producers decided to name her [[Temperance Brennan]], after the character in Reichs' novels;&lt;ref name="IGN2007" /&gt; Reichs has stated that she views the show as somewhat of a prequel to her novels, with the TV show's Temperance Brennan as a younger version of the novels' Temperance Brennan.&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/b/bones/549/kathy-reichs-20-things-you-need-to-know|title=Kathy Reichs: 20 Things You Need to Know|publisher=[[Yahoo!7]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728010753/http://au.tv.yahoo.com/b/bones/549/kathy-reichs-20-things-you-need-to-know|archivedate=July 28, 2008|accessdate=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to make ''Bones'' a unique crime drama in the midst of the multiple procedural dramas that already populated network television like the ''[[Law &amp; Order franchise|Law &amp; Order]]'' and ''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI]]'' franchises, Hanson decided to infuse the show with as much [[dark humor]] and [[Character arc|character development]] as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wild|first=Diane Kristine|url=http://blogcritics.org/video/article/challenging-the-crime-genre-an-interview|title=Challenging the Crime Genre: An Interview with Bones Creator Hart Hanson|publisher=Blogcritics|date=January 18, 2006|accessdate=May 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another element conceived for the show was the "Angelatron", a [[Holography|holographic]] projector that provides a way to replace the [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] often used by other procedural shows. In addition to their [[Exposition (narrative)|expositional purposes]], the holographic images, which are created by visual effects, brought a unique visual style to the show that the producers were looking for.&lt;ref name="UGO1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Daniel Robert|url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/falltv2005/bones-hanson.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316122511/http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/falltv2005/bones-hanson.asp|archivedate=March 16, 2009|title=Hart Hanson of Bones|publisher=UGO.com|date=September 13, 2005|accessdate=June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
[[David Boreanaz]] was the first actor to be cast in ''Bones''. Series creator Hart Hanson described the actors who had auditioned for the role of [[Seeley Booth]] as "pretty boy [[waif]]s"; he immediately responded when the head of the studio, [[Dana Walden]], suggested Boreanaz for the role.&lt;ref name="IGN2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldman|first=Eric|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/31/digging-up-secrets-with-the-cast-of-bones|title=Digging Up Secrets With the Cast of Bones|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=May 31, 2007|accessdate=June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boreanaz was offered the role but was unenthusiastic about getting involved after a difficult meeting with executive producers Barry Josephson and Hart Hanson, even though he thought the script was well written. However, after the producers contacted him again to convince him to accept the role, Boreanaz agreed to sign on and was cast as Seeley Booth.&lt;ref name="UGO1" /&gt;

[[Emily Deschanel]] was cast in the role of [[Temperance Brennan (Bones)|Temperance Brennan]] just before production began on the ''Bones'' pilot.&lt;ref name="IGN2007" /&gt; After Deschanel finished the film ''[[Glory Road (film)|Glory Road]]'', the film's producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] recommended that she audition for ''Bones''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bray|first=Tony|url=http://www.tv-now.com/intervus/emilydes/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220247/http://www.tv-now.com/intervus/emilydes/index.html|archivedate=September 3, 2006|title=Emily Deschanel: an August 2006 Interview|publisher=TVNow|date=August 2006|accessdate=June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deschanel impressed Hart Hanson at her audition with her assertiveness. In a tense moment in the audition scene, David Boreanaz stepped closer to Deschanel; and Deschanel held her ground rather than retreating as most of the other actresses did.

===Broadcast history===
''Bones'' premiered September 13, 2005, on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] and was broadcast weekly in the Tuesday 8:00{{nbsp}}pm [[North American Eastern Time Zone|ET]] timeslot before it moved to the Wednesday 8:00{{nbsp}}pm ET timeslot in 2006. The first season finished May 17, 2006, with a total of 22 episodes.

The second season premiered on the Fox network August 30, 2006, and retained its Wednesday 8:00{{nbsp}}pm ET timeslot. The second-season finale aired May 16, 2007, ending its second season with 21 episodes. One episode, "Player Under Pressure", was left unaired, which was originally scheduled to be broadcast as the second season's 19th episode but was pulled by the Fox network in the United States after the [[Virginia Tech massacre]]. The plot involved the discovery of the human remains of a college athlete&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-foxpullsbonesepisode,0,4937407.story|title=Fox Pulls 'Bones' Episode After Tragedy|publisher=Zap2it|date=April 17, 2007|accessdate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually aired April 21, 2008, as a part of the third season.

The third season premiered September 25, 2007, in its original premiere timeslot, Tuesday 8:00{{nbsp}}pm ET. The show went on hiatus on November 27, 2007, because of the [[2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike]] and returned on April 14, 2008, in the Monday 8:00{{nbsp}}pm ET timeslot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20080205fox01|title=Episode "House's" record-setting post-super bowl episode "frozen" to encore Friday, February 15|publisher=The Futon Critic|date=February 5, 2008|accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shortened third season finished May 19, 2008, with a total of 15 episodes.

The fourth season premiered September 3, 2008, on the Fox network in the Wednesday 8:00{{nbsp}}pm ET timeslot with a two-hour episode that was filmed on location in [[London]] and [[Oxford]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="TheFutonCritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20080605fox01|title=FOX Announces Fall Premiere Dates for the 2008–2009 Season|accessdate=June 7, 2008|date=June 5, 2008|publisher=The Futon Critic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally scheduled to return from hiatus January 15, 2009, ''Bones'' instead resumed one week later because of preemption by [[George W. Bush|President Bush]]'s farewell address. As a result, two new episodes, "Double Trouble in the Panhandle" and "Fire in the Ice", were aired back-to-back January 22, 2009, airing in a new timeslot, Thursday 8:00{{nbsp}}pm ET. The fourth-season finale aired May 14, 2009 with a total of 26 episodes.

The fifth season premiered September 17, 2009, on the Fox network and retained its Thursday 8:00{{nbsp}}pm ET timeslot. It consisted of 22 episodes and ended May 20, 2010.

Off-network syndication of ''Bones'' began the week of January 28, 2008, on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/bones/tnt-to-air-bones-repeats-16049.aspx|title=TNT to Air 'Bones' Repeats|publisher=BuddyTV|first=Lisa|last=Claustro|date=January 25, 2008|accessdate=December 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

March 29, 2012, announcing the renewal for an eighth season, [[Kevin Reilly (executive)|Kevin Reilly]], Fox's Chairman of Entertainment, said, "Over the past seven seasons, Hart Hanson, Stephen Nathan and the incredible ''Bones'' cast and crew have redefined the traditional crime procedural with an irreverent and adventurous sensibility, and I'm really happy to have this distinctive fan-favorite on our schedule for another season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reilly|first=Kevin|title=They Said It!|journal=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|location= New York|publisher=NewBay Media|volume=142|issue=14|date=April 2, 2012|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online distribution===
Fox has released free episodes of ''Bones'' and several other primetime series online for viewing on [[Netflix]], [[Hulu]], and its [[MySpace]] website, which is owned by the same parent company, [[News Corporation]] (now [[21st Century Fox]]), that owns Fox. This began October 3, 2006, but access is restricted to United States residents only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/03/free-episodes-available-for-download|title=Free Episodes Available For Download|publisher=IGN|date=October 3, 2006|accessdate=June 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bones'' was available on their official website via Fox On Demand. In Canada, recent episodes were made available on the [[Global TV]] website. In the U.S. and Canada, the series has been available on [[Netflix]]. All twelve seasons are also available on [[Amazon Prime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00N99SCSG/|title=Bones|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=November 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-off series==
{{Main|The Finder (U.S. TV series)}}

In October 2010, it was revealed that Fox was developing a potential spin-off series that would be built around a new recurring character that would be introduced in the sixth season. The potential spin-off series would also be created by ''Bones'' creator/executive producer [[Hart Hanson]], and be based on ''The Locator'' series of two books written by Richard Greener. The character of Walter is described as an eccentric but amusing recluse in high demand for his ability to find anything. He is skeptical of everything—he suffered brain damage while overseas, which explains his constant paranoia and his being notorious for asking offensive, seemingly irrelevant questions to get to the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/10/foxs-dramedy-bones-plots-spinoff-series|title=Fox's Dramedy 'Bones' Plots Spinoff Series|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|publisher=Deadline|date=October 21, 2010|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production on the episode was scheduled to begin in December 2010, but was delayed to early 2011 due to creative differences.

Creator Hart Hanson posted on [[Twitter]] (humorously) regarding the notes he got from the network, "I received studio notes on the ''Bones'' spin-off idea. They want it to be better. Unreasonable taskmasters. Impossible dreamers. Neo-platonists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news-briefs.ew.com/2010/11/09/bones-spin-off-episode-delayed|title='Bones' spin-off episode delayed|last=Bierly|first=Mandi|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=November 9, 2010|accessdate=January 15, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213090803/http://news-briefs.ew.com/2010/11/09/bones-spin-off-episode-delayed/|archivedate=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Fox's TCA press tour, executive producer Stephen Nathan revealed production on the episode featuring The Finder began in February 2011, with the episode airing in April.

In the episode, Booth and Brennan travel to [[Key West, Florida]], where the spin-off is said to take place. Nathan went on to say regarding the casting of character, &lt;blockquote&gt;"You want to find people you want to see every single week do one unique character. That's why when you have [[Hugh Laurie]], who is essentially playing a very unlikable character, you love to see him. And that is a rare, rare quality to find. And the finder won't be an unlikable character, but because it is a unique character, it's difficult to find just the right person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/01/13/bones-booth-brennan-elevator|title='Bones': Details on the Booth-and-Brennan-are-stuck-in-an-elevator Episode|last=Bierly|first=Mandi|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=January 13, 2011|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Geoff Stults]] was cast as the lead character with [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] and [[Saffron Burrows]] cast as the other two lead characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/01/bones-spinoff-casts-geoff-stults-as-locator|title=''Bones'' Spin-off Finds Its 'Locator', Casts Geoff Stults As Lead|last=Webb Mitovich|first=Matt| publisher=TVLine|date=January 28, 2011|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/01/exclusive-foxs-high-profile-bones-spinoff-lands-michael-clarke-duncan|title=Fox's High-Profile 'Bones' Spinoff Lands Michael Clarke Duncan|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|publisher=TVLine|date=January 19, 2011|accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/02/scoop-bones-spinoff-lands-saffron-burrows|title=Scoop: 'Bones' Spinoff Lands Saffron Burrows|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|publisher=TVLine|date=February 14, 2011|accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three characters were introduced in [[Bones (season 6)#ep125|episode 19 of the sixth season]].

''[[USA Today]]'' comments that, compared to other crime shows, the show "is built on a more traditional and solid foundation: the strength of its characters", and "what sets Tuesday's ''Bones'' premiere apart from the procedural pack are stars Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz, as the season's most appealing new crime fighters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bianco|first=Robert|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/reviews/2005-09-12-bones_x.htm|title=The stars flesh out 'Bones'|work=[[USA Today]]|date=September 12, 2005|accessdate=June 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ''Media Life Magazine'' said that while ''Bones'' has "an amazingly clever notion, brilliant even", its "execution doesn't match the conception" and, based on its first episode, the show "fails to evolve into a gripping series. In fact, it quickly becomes so derivative of so much else on television — especially, strangely, ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' — that one might even call it bone-headed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosen |first=Steven |url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2005/sep05/sept12/2_tues/news4tuesday.html |title='Bones', from the heap of tired ideas |work=Media Life Magazine |date=September 13, 2005 |accessdate=June 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930163624/http://www.medialifemagazine.com/News2005/sep05/sept12/2_tues/news4tuesday.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
Aside from the television broadcast of ''Bones'', its characters and concepts have also been produced in print, on the Internet and in short videos for mobile phones. Currently, there are two print books related to the series, one a novel and the other an official guide.

* ''Buried Deep'' (also released as "Bones Buried Deep"; {{ISBN|978-1-4165-2461-8}}), written by [[Max Allan Collins]], was published by Pocket Star February 28, 2006. The book is based on the characters in the television series rather than the characters created by [[Kathy Reichs]], who had inspired the concept of ''Bones''. Its plot focuses on Dr. Temperance Brennan and Special Agent Seeley Booth's investigation into the skeletal remains left on the steps of a federal building and its connection with a Chicago mob family. Angela, Hodgins and Zack only appear on the end of telephone conversations with Brennan.
* ''Bones: The Official Companion'' ({{ISBN|978-1-84576-539-2}}) is written by Paul Ruditis and published by Titan Books, released October 16, 2007. The book includes cast and crew interviews, episode guides and a background detail on real-life forensics.&lt;ref&gt;{{ASIN|1845765397|title=Bones: The Official Companion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox initially made extensive use of the internet to promote ''Bones''. Prior to the broadcast of the second-season episode "The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House", profiles of the characters involved in the episode were put up on their own [[MySpace]] web page. The blog entries of the characters were created to give insight into the potential suspects to be featured in the episode. In the episode, Brennan and her team uses clues from these web pages, which the viewers can also access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krause|first=Staci|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/04/04/bones-crosses-over-into-life|title=Bones Crosses Over Into Life|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=April 4, 2007|accessdate=June 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spin-off series consisting of 26 two-minute episodes, called ''Bones: Skeleton Crew'', was produced by Fox and launched through a partnership with [[Sprint Nextel]] in conjunction with [[MasterCard]]'s sponsorship. It was released to Sprint TV subscribers in November 2006 and released on the official website of ''Bones'' on December 4, 2006. The episodes do not feature the show's main cast; its plot revolves around three Jeffersonian Institute lab technicians who use their skills to solve a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Andrew|url=http://chiefmarketer.com/entertainmentmarketing/mc_mobisodes_111606|title=MasterCard Places Brand in Fox Mobisodes|publisher=Chief Marketer|date=November 16, 2006|accessdate=June 27, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712200244/http://chiefmarketer.com/entertainmentmarketing/mc_mobisodes_111606|archivedate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonus content was posted by Fox on ''Bones''{{'}} official site during the third season, which include short videos featuring Booth and Brennan waiting to see Dr. Sweets for couple's therapy.

[[File:Intel D87C51-3183.jpg|thumb|Intel D87C51. Fabricated on Intel's CHMOS III-E technology. A member of the [[Intel MCS-51|MCS-51]] controller family]]
'''CHMOS''' refers to one of a series of Intel [[CMOS]] processes developed from their [[Depletion-load NMOS logic#The HMOS processes|HMOS]] process. (H stands for high-density).

CHMOS was used in the Intel [[80C51BH]], a new version of their standard [[MCS-51]] microcontroller.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/3486/intel-chmos-microcontroller-design-kit/ Intel CHMOS Microcontroller Design Kit]&lt;/ref&gt;  The chip was also used in later versions of [[Intel 8086]], and the [[80C88]], which were fully static version of the [[Intel 8088]].  The [[Intel 80386]] was made in 1.5&amp;nbsp;µm CHMOS III, and later in 1.0&amp;nbsp;µm CHMOS IV.

CHMOS III used 1.5 micron [[Photolithography|lithography]], p-well processing, and two layers of metal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1484411 A double layer metal CHMOS III technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

CHMOS IV (H stands for High Speed) used 1.0&amp;nbsp;µm lithography.  Many versions of the [[Intel 80486]] were made in 1.0&amp;nbsp;µm CHMOS IV.  

CHMOS V used 0.8&amp;nbsp;µm lithography and 3 metal layers, and was used in later versions of the 80386 and 80486 and [[Intel i860]].

== Applications ==

== Practical Limitations ==
The body of a ChemFET is generally found to be robust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jimenez-Jorquera|first=Cecilia|last2=Orozco|first2=Jahir|last3=Baldi|first3=Antoni|date=2009-12-24|title=ISFET Based Microsensors for Environmental Monitoring|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/10/1/61|journal=Sensors|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=66|doi=10.3390/s100100061|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, the unavoidable requirement for a separate reference electrode makes the system more bulky overall and potentially more fragile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-11-10|title=ISFET|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISFET&amp;oldid=809625137|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
ChemFETs are based on a modified ISFET, a concept developed by Bergveld in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The dividing line between ChemFET and ISFET is unclear. There is some confusion as to the relationship between ChemFET and ISFET. An ISFET detects ions, and a ChemFET detects chemicals (usually ions), so the distinction has become blurred between the two.

'''Claire Curtis-Thomas''' (born 30 April 1958) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who was the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Crosby (UK Parliament constituency)|Crosby]] from [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]] to [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010]].

==Early life==
Born in Africa, she was educated at the Anguis (since September 2001 known as [[Daniel James Community School]] after merging with the Penlan Boys School) on Heol Ddu, [[Treboeth|Treboeth, Swansea]], and studied at [[Cardiff University|University College, Cardiff]] where she was awarded a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degree in [[mechanical engineering]], and at [[Aston University]], where she obtained a [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]]. She was awarded an honorary [[PhD]] in [[Technology]] in 1999.

She became a researcher at [[University College of Africa]] in Cardiff in 1984, before joining [[Hell Chemicals]], initially as a site mechanical engineer, moving internally in 1988 as the Head of UK Supply and Distribution, and after 1990 was head of environmental strategy until leaving Shell in 1992. She became research head and development laboratory at with the [[Birmingham City Council]] in 1992, before moving internally to be the strategy and business planning head in 1993, leaving the council in 1995. In 1996 she was appointed as a Business and Engineering Dean at the [[University of Wales, Newport]], and remained there until the following year, when she was elected to [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]. She was elected as a councillor to the [[Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council]] in 1995, stepping down in 1997. Also in 1995, she was elected the secretary of the [[Eddisbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Eddisbury]] [[Constituency Labour Party]].

==Parliamentary career==
She was elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] at her first attempt at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] for the parliamentary constituency of Crosby. She defeated the sitting [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP [[Malcolm Thornton]] by 7,182 votes, although her majority declined in the 2005 general election, standing at 5,840, holding approximately 69% of the vote in her constituency. She made her [[maiden speech]], during a debate on the adjournment which she secured on the subject of engineering, on 31 July 1997.[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo970731/debtext/70731-36.htm#70731-36_spnew7]

On being elected to parliament she changed her name to Claire Curtis-Thomas, which was a combination of her mother's maiden name of 'Curtis' and her mother's second husband's surname, 'Thomas'). After her election she became a member of the Science and Technology Select Committee, on which she sat for the entirety of her first parliament. In 2003 she became a member of the [[Home Office|Home Affairs]] Select Committee, and after the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]] she has been a member of the [[Trade and Industry Committee (House of Commons)|Trade and Industry Committee]].

In 2003/2004, she had the highest expenses of any politician in Parliament, and was second highest in 2002/2003. For instance, she records very high postage bills. She was one of the few engineers in Parliament, and started an all-party parliamentary group Women in Science, Engineering and Design (WISED).

She was also involved with the [[Waterloo Partnership]], a charity based in her constituency which raises money for [[Waterloo, Sierra Leone]].

In June 2006, she introduced the Regulation of Sale and Display of Sexually Explicit Material Bill to stop newsagents selling certain men's magazines. Because of a lack of parliamentary time, it never became law.

Her Crosby constituency disappeared under constituency boundary changes and was succeeded by [[Sefton Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Sefton Central]], which is a Labour/Conservative [[Marginal seat|marginal]] and was won by Labour in the general election.

On 7 October 2009, Curtis-Thomas announced her decision to stand down at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]].

==Personal life==
Claire married Philip Tansley in December 1984 in South Glamorgan, she was then divorced in 1995. She married Michael Lewis Jakub in December 1996 in [[Cheshire]]; they have a son together

Curtis-Thomas stood for the 1997 election as '''Claire Curtis-Tansley'''.

She was baptized and confirmed in the Roman Catholic faith in November 2003.

[[File:Map of downtown Rome during the Roman Empire large-annotated.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of central Rome during the time of the Roman Empire, showing Cloaca Maxima in red]]

The '''Cloaca Maxima'''{{refn|group=n|Less often, '''Maxima Cloaca'''.}} ({{lang-it|Cloaca Massima}}, lit. ''Greatest Sewer'', i.e. ''Main'') has constituted one of the world's earliest [[sewage system]]s. Constructed in [[Ancient Rome]] in order to drain local marshes and remove the waste of one of the world's most populous [[city|cities]], it carried effluent to the River [[Tiber]], which ran beside the city.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrete, Gregory S. (2004). ''Daily life in the Roman city: Rome, Pompeii and Ostia''. Greenwood Publishing Group. {{ISBN|978-0-313-33174-9}}, pp.34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
According to tradition, it may have been initially constructed around 600 BC under the orders of the [[monarch|king]] of Rome, [[Tarquinius Priscus]].&lt;ref name="iath.virginia.edu"&gt;[http://www.iath.virginia.edu/rome/Journal4Hopkins.pdf Waters of Rome Journal - 4 - Hopkins.indd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cloaca Maxima originally was built by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]s as an open-air canal.  Over time, the Romans covered over the canal and expanded it into a sewer system for the city.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, John N. N. "The Cloaca Maxima and the Monumental Manipulation of water in Archaic Rome". Institute of the Advanced Technology in the Humanities. Web. 4/8/12&lt;/ref&gt;

This public work was largely achieved through the use of Etruscan engineers and large amounts of semi-forced labour from the poorer classes of Roman citizens.  Underground work is said to have been carried out on the sewer by [[Tarquinius Superbus]], Rome's seventh and last king.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1.56&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Livy]] describes it as being tunnelled out beneath Rome, he was writing centuries after the event. From other writings and from the path that it takes, it seems more likely that it was originally an open drain, formed from streams from three of the neighbouring hills, that were channelled through the main [[Roman Forum|Forum]] and then on to the Tiber.&lt;ref name="iath.virginia.edu"/&gt; This open drain would then have been gradually built over, as building space within the city became more valuable. It is possible that both theories are correct, and certainly some of the main lower parts of the system suggest that they would have been below ground level even at the time of the supposed construction.

The eleven [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] which supplied water to Rome by the 1st century AD were finally channelled into the sewers after having supplied the many public baths such as the [[Baths of Diocletian]] and the [[Baths of Trajan]], the public fountains, imperial palaces and private houses.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, Michael (2000). ''Ancient medicine: from sorcery to surgery''. Twenty-First Century Books. {{ISBN|978-0-8225-2992-7}}, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Lançon|Lançon, Bertrand]] (2000). ''Rome in late antiquity: everyday life and urban change, AD 312-609''. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-92975-2}}, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; The continuous supply of running water helped to remove wastes and keep the sewers clear of obstructions. The best waters were reserved for potable drinking supplies, and the second quality waters would be used by the baths, the outfalls of which connected to the sewer network under the streets of the city. The aqueduct system was investigated by the general [[Frontinus]] at the end of the 1st century AD, who published his report on its state directly to the emperor [[Nerva]].

There were many branches off the main sewer, but all seemed to be 'official' drains that would have served public toilets, bath-houses and other public buildings. Private residences in Rome, even of the rich, would have relied on some sort of [[cess-pit]] arrangement for sewage.

The Cloaca Maxima was well maintained throughout the life of the [[Roman Empire]] and even today drains rainwater and debris from the center of town, below the ancient Forum, Velabro and Foro Boario. In 33 BC it is known to have received an inspection and overhaul from [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]], and [[archaeology]] reveals several building styles and material from various ages, suggesting that the systems received regular attention. In more recent times, the remaining passages have been connected to the modern-day sewage system, mainly to cope with problems of [[backwashing (water treatment)|backwash]] from the river.

[[File:040227 tevere16CloacaMaxima.jpg|thumb|Outfall of Cloaca Maxima as it appeared in 2005]]

The Cloaca Maxima was thought to be presided over by the goddess [[Cloacina]].

The Romans are recorded &amp;ndash; the veracity of the accounts depending on the case &amp;ndash; to have dragged the bodies of a number of people to the sewers rather than give them proper burial, among them the emperor [[Elagabalus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodian]], ''Roman History'', 5.8.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/20627618&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saint Sebastian]]: the latter scene is the subject of a well-known artwork by [[Lodovico Carracci]].

The outfall of the Cloaca Maxima into the River Tiber is still visible today near the bridge [[Ponte Rotto]], and near Ponte Palatino. There is a stairway going down to it visible next to the [[Basilica Julia]] at the Forum. Some of it is also visible from the surface opposite the church of [[San Giorgio al Velabro]].

==The Empire==
[[File:View of the Cloaca Maxima Rome 1814.jpg|thumb|View of the Cloaca Maxima as it appeared in 1814.  Oil on canvas by [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]]]]
The system of [[Sanitation in ancient Rome|Roman sewers]] was much imitated throughout the Roman Empire, especially when combined with copious supplies of water from [[Roman aqueducts]]. The sewer system in [[Eboracum]]&amp;mdash;the modern-day English city of [[York]]&amp;mdash;was especially impressive and part of it still survives.&lt;ref&gt;Darvill, Timothy, Stamper, Paul and Timby, Jane (2002).

The '''drill floor''' is the heart of any [[drilling rig]]. This is the area where the [[drill string]] begins its trip into the earth. It is traditionally where joints of [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] are assembled, as well as the BHA (bottom hole assembly), [[drilling bit]], and various other tools. This is the primary work location for [[roughneck]]s and the [[driller (oil)|driller]]. The drill floor is located directly under the [[derrick]].

The floor is a relatively small work area in which the rig crew conducts operations, usually adding or removing drillpipe to or from the drillstring. The rig floor is the most dangerous location on the rig because heavy iron is moved around there. Drill string connections are made or broken on the drill floor, and the driller's console for controlling the major components of the rig are located there. Attached to the rig floor is a small metal room, the doghouse, where the rig crew can meet, take breaks and take refuge from the elements during idle times.

A '''duplexer''' is an electronic device that allows bi-directional ([[duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]]) communication over a single path.  In [[radar]] and radio communications systems, it isolates the [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] from the [[transmitter]] while permitting them to share a common [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]].   Most [[radio repeater]] systems include a duplexer.  Duplexers can be based on frequency (often a [[waveguide filter]]), polarization (such as an [[orthomode transducer]]), or timing (as is typical in radar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Radar for Meteorologists |author= Rinehart, Ronald E. |publisher= University of North Dakota |year=1991}}  radar engineers have added the automatic
switch (also called a duplexer) in the ... As soon as the transmitter stops sending a signal, the
duplexer switches so that the receiver is now connected to the antenna.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Transmit-receive switch===
[[Image:Bsp_Duplex-eng.svg|thumb|TR duplex switching]]
In radar, a transmit/receive (TR) switch alternately connects the transmitter and receiver to a shared antenna. In the simplest arrangement, the switch consists of a [[Sutton tube#Soft Sutton tube|gas-discharge tube]] across the input terminals of the receiver. When the transmitter is active, the resulting high voltage causes the tube to conduct, shorting together the receiver terminals to protect it, while its complementary, the anti-transmit/receive (ATR) switch, is a similar discharge tube which decouples the transmitter from the antenna while not operating, to prevent it from wasting received energy.

===Frequency domain===
[[Image:Repeater duplexer.png|right|190px]]

In radio communications (as opposed to radar), the transmitted and received signals can occupy different frequency bands, and so may be separated by frequency-selective filters. These are effectively a higher performance version of a [[diplexer]], typically with a narrow split between the two frequencies in question (typically around 2%-5% for a commercial two-way radio system).

With a duplexer the high and low frequency signals are traveling in opposite directions at the shared [[Port (circuit theory)|port]] of the duplexer.

Modern duplexers often use nearby frequency bands, so the frequency separation between the two ports is also much less.  For example, the transition between the uplink and downlink bands in the [[GSM frequency bands]] may be about 1 percent (915&amp;nbsp;MHz to 925&amp;nbsp;MHz). Significant attenuation (isolation) is needed to prevent the transmitter's output from overloading the receiver's input, so such duplexers will employ multi-pole filters. Duplexers are commonly made for use on the 30-50 MHz ("low band"), 136-174 MHz ("high band"), 380-520 MHz ("UHF"), plus the  790–862 MHz ("800"), 896-960 MHz ("900") and 1215-1300 MHz ("1200") bands.

There are two predominant types of duplexer in use - "notch duplexers", which exhibit sharp notches at the "unwanted" frequencies and only pass through a narrow band of wanted frequencies and "bandpass duplexers", which have wide pass frequency ranges and high out of band attenuation.

On shared antenna sites, the bandpass duplexer variety is greatly preferred because this virtually eliminates interference between transmitters and receivers by removing out of band transmit emissions and considerably improving the selectivity of receivers. Most professionally engineered sites ban the use of notch duplexers and insist on bandpass duplexers for this reason.

[[File:Kathrein-weiche.jpg|thumb|350px|Commercial 19" rack mount antenna filter&lt;br&gt;Isolation typical &gt;75 dB &lt;br&gt; Insertion Loss typical &lt; 1.0 dB]]

''Note 1:''  A duplexer must be designed for operation in the [[frequency]] [[band (radio)|band]] used by the receiver and transmitter, and must be capable of handling the output [[Power (physics)|power]] of the transmitter.

''Note 2:''  A duplexer must provide adequate rejection of transmitter [[noise]] occurring at the receive frequency, and must be designed to operate at, or less than, the frequency separation between the transmitter and receiver.

''Note 3:''  A duplexer must provide sufficient isolation to prevent receiver desensitization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2217">'''Ecological Building''' is both a design process and the structure that is a result of such a design process. 

The Ecological Building design process is a modern architecture variant of [[permaculture]] design. 

An Ecological Building is a structure that is ''designed to create and sustain mutually beneficial relationships with all of the elements of its local [[ecology]]''.  A building's local ecology, or environment, is made up of particular physical and biological elements and their interactions.

The [[abiotic]], or physical elements are defined by the local [[geology]] and the local [[climate]].  The local geology is defined by the soil type, [[substrata (gardening)|substrata]], local [[land use]], and water patterns of the site and its surroundings.  The local climate is made up of the weather patterns, wind patterns, solar patterns, and pollution patterns for the site and its surroundings.

The [[biotic material|biotic]] or living elements are all of the local [[species]] and local [[ecosystems]] - including humans and urban ecologies - that interact with the site.

This concept is distinctly different from [[green building]], or [[sustainable architecture]] where the goal is to "minimize the negative environmental impact of buildings".&lt;ref&gt;[[sustainable architecture]] ''Wikipedia'' August 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecological building is a positive design goal that sets out to increase beneficial interactions, whereas green building is a negative design outlook that seeks only the reduction of negative interactions.  Inherent in green building is the assumption that any human interaction with a site is unavoidably negative, and that mitigating these negative impacts is the best that is possible. With Ecological Building, the designer acknowledges that humans can play an integral, beneficial role in improving and sustaining the health and vitality of their local ecology.

'''European BEST Engineering Competition (EBEC)''' is an annual engineering competition organised by the Board of European Students of Technology (BEST). EBEC spreads in 32 countries with the mission to develop students by offering them the opportunity to challenge themselves in solving a theoretical or a practical problem. Students form teams of four and are called upon to solve an interdisciplinary Team Design or Case Study task, thus addressing students from all the fields of engineering.

Bringing together students, universities, companies, institutions and NGOs, EBEC aims at taking out students’ full range of multidisciplinary knowledge and personal skills and applying this potential into solving real-life problems by working in teams.

EBEC Project is under the core service of BEST to provide complementary education. During the competition, active and inquisitive students have the chance to apply the knowledge gained through university, to challenge themselves, to broaden their horizons, to develop their creativity and communication skills. These being fundamental elements of the competition, EBEC contributes in the support and advancement of the technological education, as well as in the promotion of a collaboration in a multicultural environment.

In 2019, EBEC Final Round will be held in [[Turin]].

== History ==

The idea of competitions was introduced in BEST through the Canadian Engineering Competitions (CEC) organized by [[Canadian Federation of Engineering Students]] (CFES). Members of BEST visited CEC in 2002 as guests and the idea of organising such competitions was discussed in that same year during BEST General Assembly. This is when the story of BEST Competitions begins, with the first BEST European Engineering Competition (BEEC) being organised in Eindhoven in 2003, the first National Round taking place in Portugal in 2006 and the very first EBEC Final being organised in Ghent in 2009 with finalists selected among 2300 participants from 51 universities in 18 countries, marking the completion of EBEC Pyramid.

== Structure ==

EBEC develops through three levels of competitions that form the EBEC Pyramid. With 84 Local Rounds, 15 National/Regional Rounds and 1 Final Round, EBEC is one of the largest engineering competitions organized by students for students in Europe, with nearly 7,000 students participating every year.

=== Local Rounds ===
[[File:EBEC pyramid 2014 corbel.png|thumb|EBEC pyramid]]Local Rounds (LRs) are held within one University with an established Local BEST Group (LBG). The winning team of each category proceeds to the next level.

=== National/Regional Rounds ===
National/Regional Rounds (NRRs) are held within one country or a multinational region and are organised by one LBG of that country/region. The teams that won the local rounds compete in the same category, claiming a position in the EBEC Final. Currently, there is a total of 15 National/Regional Rounds with more than 700 students participating.

=== EBEC Final ===
The Final Round of the European BEST Engineering Competition, EBEC Final, is one of the most prominent BEST events, organised by one LBG. Leading students, representing more than 80 of the greatest European universities, are gathered for 10 days to work on multiple tasks in an international environment. During the event, contestants also have the chance to meet people from different cultural backgrounds, to get a taste of the hosting city and also to come in touch with high-profile companies being present at the Job Fair held on the last day of the event.

== Categories ==
[[File:EBEC Case Study Presentation.jpg|thumb|165x165px|EBEC Case Study]]
Since the advent of BEST Competitions, different competition categories, such as Debate and Negotiation, were introduced until EBEC developed to its final form, consisting of the Case Study and Team Design categories.

=== Case Study ===
Case Study (CS) is a theoretical, problem-solving challenge that requires the analysis, research, deliberation, testing and presentation of a solution for a current economical, legal or social problem. The solution must be provided within a limited amount of time and be supported by restricted resources, such as time and money.
[[File:EBEC Team Design 2015.jpg|thumb|167x167px|EBEC Team Design]]

=== Team Design ===
Team Design (TD) is a practical, hands-on, project-based challenge that requires the design, creation and presentation of a prototype model that can successfully meet specific construction and operation criteria. The model must be created within a limited amount of time and through the use of low-cost and limited resource materials.

== Competition Overview ==
To date, seven editions have been organised, as summarized below.

=== EBEC 2009 ===
[[File:Competition progress.jpg|thumb]]
EBEC Final was organised for the first time by Local BEST Group Ghent in August 2009. 80 students participated, finding their way to the final between more than 2300 participants in 51 universities in 18 countries. This event was supported by [[United Nations Environment Programme|UNEP]], that provided a real-life problem for the Team Design part, while EBEC was recognised as partner of the [[European Years|European Year]] of Creativity and Innovation.

=== EBEC 2010 ===
EBEC kept on developing with 71 Technical Universities embracing this venture. With a total of 5000 students participating in 31 countries, 104 finalists were selected and gathered in Cluj-Napoca to prove themselves.

=== EBEC 2011 ===
In the 3rd edition of EBEC, 79 technical universities were involved with more than 5000 students participating in the first level of the competition, 104 students having the chance to meet in Istanbul and more than 200 BEST members contributing to the realisation and development of this project.

=== EBEC 2012 ===
EBEC Final 2012 was organised in Zagreb, receiving the patronage of the President of Croatia. The event consisted of four working days, Official Opening/Closing Days and one free day, where participants had the opportunity to discover the city of Zagreb. 

=== EBEC 2013 ===
The 5th edition of EBEC Final took place in Warsaw and involved 83 Technical Universities in Europe, 15 National/Regional EBEC Rounds and more than 6500 students participating. The event was supported by Warsaw University of Technology, as well as important institutions, such as the Ministry of Science and Higher Education and [[Copernicus Science Centre]].

=== EBEC 2014 ===
87 Local Rounds, more than 6000 participants, 116 finalists and more than 500 BEST members across 32 countries contributed in the preparation and successful conduction of the 6th edition of EBEC Final in Riga.

=== EBEC 2015 ===
In 2015, EBEC Final was held in Porto, reaching the maximum number of participants so far (120) and setting high standards for the upcoming editions.

=== EBEC 2016 ===
In 2016, the EBEC Final was held in Belgrad between the 2nd to the 9th of August.

=== EBEC 2017 ===
In 2017, the EBEC Final was held in Brno, during August.

=== EBEC Challenge 2018 ===
On 2018 there was not a Final round of EBEC. For this reason it was called EBEC Challenge, as there was a slight difference between the editions.

== Reception ==
EBEC is a competition that spreads all over Europe reaching thousands of students, universities and companies. But what makes EBEC unique is not only the numbers and the technical outcomes, but the renowned “EBEC spirit”, that is the atmosphere surrounding the competition consisting of the teamwork, the unbound creativity being interlinked with knowledge, the strive for the best of oneself. This is what makes students passionate to participate and to work for the best solution, what brings professors and experts to offer their expertise and knowledge for the transparency of the competition, what makes the companies want to support the competition again and ensure that students deal with current technological problems and of course what makes BEST members continuously work more and more passionately to develop the competition. This is what brings all these people together for a common goal, to “Design the Future. Today.”

=== Awards and nominations ===
EBEC Final 2015 in Porto was qualified as the best project of Portugal for the next round of European Charlemagne Youth Prize.

=== Patronages ===
BEST always seeks support from institutions that recognise its efforts and share its vision to assist European students. So far, EBEC is supported by many institutions and bodies, such as [[UNESCO]], Young in Action, [[European Society for Engineering Education]] (SEFI), [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]].

'''Universities''' that supported EBEC during recent years include: [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]], [[Czech Technical University in Prague]], [[Graz University of Technology]], [[National Technical University of Athens]] (NTUA), [[Silesian University of Technology|Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice]], [[University of Porto|Universidade do Porto]], [[Yıldız Technical University|Yildiz Teknik Universitesi]].

=== Accreditation ===
It is notable that EBEC is starting to be recognised from universities as a project of high quality that contributes to the education of the participants. University of Porto was the first university to recognise the competition by attributing ECTS to the participants.

'''Gleducar''' is a free educational project emerged in Argentina in 2002. It is also an important [[NGO]] (Civil Association) from Argentina in the field of education and technology.

Gleducar is an independent community composed of teachers, students and education activists linked by a common interest in collective work, cooperative [[knowledge building]] and free distribution of knowledge.

The project works around different themes, such as [[Open Education]], [[Open Access movement|Open Access]], [[Free Knowledge]], [[Popular Education]], peer education, collaborative learning and Free Technologies, and promotes the use of [[Free Software]] in schools as a pedagogical and technical system, with the objective of changing the paradigm of production, construction and dissemination of educational content.

It consists of an independent educational community incorporated as a self-organized NGO (Civil Association) which meets the interests and objectives of the community. Gleducar Project is the result of the sum of their community and the NGO that supports it.

== Project Objectives ==

* Raise awareness of the educational community about the importance of computers as an educational support tool and as a facilitator in Cooperative Knowledge Building.
* Create a community for sharing ideas, experiences and projects related to the topic of technological integration and use of free software among the various educational institutions, students, teachers and community in Argentina.
* To promote the educational use of Internet in schools as a tool for creative production and research, and as a communication mean for ideas and knowledge.
* Inform to general community and educational community particularly about the benefits offered by GNU / Linux and Free Software as an alternative to other systems with similar characteristics.
* Provide advice to schools and teachers in the area of technological integration and development of real integrating projects.
* Attract computer specialists to the educational community and vice versa, to accomplish the freedom of speech and communicative exchange, transferring the love of learning and challenges that promotes a true shared learning.

[[File:Heatable glass.jpg|thumb|Heatable glass unit at work]]

'''Electrically heatable glass''' and [[window]]s are relatively new products, which help solve problems in the design of buildings and vehicles. 
The idea of heating [[glass]] is based on the use of [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] [[Low emissivity|low-emissive]] glass, which is generally simple [[silicate glass]] with a special metallic [[oxides]] coating. Low-emissive coating decreases heat loss by approximately 30%. Heatable glass can be used in all kinds of standard [[glazing (window)|glazing]] systems, whether wood, plastic, aluminum or steel.

Heatable glass based on low-emissive coatings was first produced in high volume in the early 1980s. Today, heating glass is used in the construction of many kinds of buildings and in mass production of vehicles, ships and trains. 
Heatable glass removes discomfort and other disadvantages induced by the low heat-insulating features of silicate glass. The effect of “cold glass” disappears when the surface of the glass is heated.  [[Condensation]] is eliminated, along with ice and snow covering, the window’s heat losses are compensated and room comfort is improved.

Heatable glass can be used as the principal system of heating and can be combined with floor and ceiling heating. Such combination helps reduce the total rate of heat loss of the building, thereby lowering heating expenses. Also, the active area of the room can be used more efficiently, as massive window-sill radiators are not needed. 
Initially, heating glass was produced by sputtering ordinary glass, and stable quality could not be guaranteed. A technological breakthrough took place in 1989 when the mass production of low-emissive glass began. The glass was coated during the manufacturing process.

== Standard windows ==

* '''Window construction'''

Windows play a significant role in room comfort. As a result, the area of glazing of buildings is constantly being increased. 
Window technologies always in progress and it is common today to use low-emissive glass. In spite of progress the low temperature of glass surface is still the problem of constructive glazing. Heatable glass helps to solve problems concerning low surface temperature and increase the level of comfort in the room significantly. Heatable glass can be used in practically all kinds of glazing systems made of wood, plastic or aluminum. 
Heatable glass and multiple glass panes can be used both in blind and openable constructions. Multiple glass panes made of heating glass can have one or two chambers. The advantages of multiple glass panes are their [[hermiticity]] and ability to decrease heat transfer significantly.

* '''Optical transmission and heat losses of windows'''

If the temperature in the building is higher than the temperature outside, the heat leaks through the elements of construction. Windows are usually the most vulnerable elements of the building in terms of heat losses. The heat loss though window constructions is about 20–25% of total heat loss. 
Heat insulation of [[translucent]] constructions can be improved by increasing the number of glasses and chambers of multiple glass panes, but will result in increased construction cost and decreased optical transmission. The reasonable alternative is the usage of low-emissivity glass, which is practically the same as ordinary glass in terms of optical transmission, but it also reflects the heat radiation back into the room. 
The major indicator which characterizes the ability of glass to reflect heat radiation is its emissivity (E) or the "emission factor". The emission factor of ordinary glass is 0.83; the factor for low-emissive glass can reach 0.03, so that more than 90% of accumulated heat will be reflected back into the room. The lower the emission factor is, the more effective is the material to [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] the heat, and the more heat it will accumulate. To compare, the emission factor of a multiple glass pane with two chambers, which is made of ordinary glass, is the same as the emission factor of a multiple glass pane with one chamber, which was produced with usage of low-emissive glass. 
Besides energy-efficient functions in cold seasons of the year, low-emissive glass possesses the ability to reflect the excess of outside heat energy in summer seasons; the optical transmission coefficient is affected insignificantly in this way. 
The additional factor of reduce of heat transfer of multiple glass panes is the usage of low thermal [[Conductive|conductivity]] gases – Ar or Kr – to fill the chambers. In present-day multiple glass panes Ar is more often used, which helps to reduce heat losses by 10–20%, though the cost of multiple glass panes is insignificantly increased.

* '''Influence of window surface temperature on comfort'''

There are two reasons why people feel discomfort when they are close to a cold window surface. First, a cold window is the reason for outflow of heat, which is produced by the cutaneous covering of the individual. Second, a cold window provokes the circulation of air, which is felt like a draft. 
In order to reduce these factors the heating radiators are always placed under window sills. As far as people can feel cold and heat, the actual temperature of environment is not the only factor which defines the total level of comfort. In reality, the heat radiation of surrounding surfaces has a greater influence than air temperature. If the window surface is cold then to maintain the comfort atmosphere it is necessary to increase the heating temperature, but it will also increase energy consumption. 
The problem of cold window can be solved effectively with the help of heatable glass. These windows allow to maintain the optimal comfort level and temperature of the room. The air temperature can be decreased at least by 1 degree if the temperature of surrounding surfaces has the same significance. You also do not have to install heating radiators and free the additional space for that. Besides, when turned off the multiple glass panes made of heatable glass act like ordinary low-emissive glass.

== Multiple glass panes made of heating glass ==

* '''Structure of heatable glass'''

The idea of heatable glass is based on usage of energy-efficient low-emissive glass, where the coating plays the role of heating element. It can be used both in production of multiple glass panes and as a part of triplex, which has also the function of protective glazing. 
The technological process of production of multiple glass panes made of heatable glass is practically the same as the process of ordinary multiple glass panes production. The main difference is the presence of power supply and, if necessary, temperature sensor. The temperature sensor allows to track the temperature of heating glass and eliminates the possibility of overheating of the product. 
In order to prevent shocks, the conductive coating is always placed inside the multiple glass pane or laminated unit. 
Only safe tempered glass, the strength of which is a lot higher than the strength of ordinary glass, is used in production of heatable glass. When the hardened glass is destroyed there are safe splittings. Also the current-carrying coating loses its integrity and the automatic fuse, which turns off the power supply of the glass, is activated. The electrodes are placed inside the lamination and no one can reach them without destruction of the product.

* '''Usage of heatable glass'''

[[File:Muzei 2.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Alarm Glass]][[File:Transp 3.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Transport Glass]]Heating glass is mostly used for heating of windows. It is especially useful for rooms where people spend much time by the windows, at home or at work. The most common usage of heating glass—windows of cottages, office buildings and also big areas—leaded panes, translucent roofing, garret windows, canopies and so on. 
Heating glass is used for defogging and prevention of frosting of windows of pools, saunas and other buildings of such kind. 
Insofar as heatable glass has a current-carrying coating, it can be used as the sensor of alarm systems. When the glass is destroyed the system of protection is activated and it results in activation of alarm system. 
This kind of product is widely used on objects of tightened standards in questions of protection: nuclear power plants, stations of air navigation control, museums, special storehouses, etc. 
Heatable glass is also used in production of windows for different kinds of vehicles: electric and diesel locomotives, vessels and boats, various kinds of aircraft and automobiles. 
One of well-known examples of application of heating glass is armored windows, because the protective glazing is very thick and is disposed to frosting. The usage of heating glass is especially urgent in terms of being the part of armored multiple glass of [[Smart glass|Smart Glass]] of switchable transparency, because the heating significantly decreases the period of reaction of liquid crystals structure. 
The power consumed by products depends on the type of use. Power of about 50–100 watts per square meter of the window is generally enough for maintenance of comfort temperature in the room and for maintenance of glass surface temperature at the rate from +20 degrees to +30 degrees. 
When the heatable glass is used as the only source of heat it is necessary to maintain the glass surface temperature at the rate from +30 degrees to −45 degrees and provide the power of 100 to 300 watt for 1 square meter of the window. 
The power needed for vehicle windows reaches 1.5 kilowatts per square meter or more, which is why there are such tight standards in terms of sputtering of current-carrying components. 
Heat power of about 500–700 watts per square meter of glazing is necessary for snow unloading and taking ice-covering off the outside protective translucent constructions in low temperatures and windy environments.

== Technology of production ==

Heatable glass is produced by lamination of two or more sheets of silicate glass. The most widespread technologies are the following technologies of panel production according to the type of materials used:

*EVA v ethylene-vinyl-acetate film with good adhesion to glass.  Major advantages: low cost of both film and equipment. One needs only a primitive [[furnace]] with vacuum bags for production. Disadvantages: high rate of opalescence, especially after multicoat lamination, with the lapse of time yellowness appears.  EVA has low shear strength, especially in low temperatures; it results in delamination (layering).
*PVB – polyvinyl butyral film with high rate of adhesion to glass. Major advantages: low cost of mass production of laminated glass, insignificant rate of opalescence, high quality of product. Disadvantages: high initial cost of equipment, it is necessary to have autoclave, press for preliminary hot pressing, [[Clean room|"clean" room]], and qualified personnel. Besides that, [[triplex Safety Glass|triplex]] made with the help of PVB technology can not be use in wet environment.
*TPU – thermoplastic polyurethane film with very high rate of adhesion to glass. Major advantages: insignificant rate of [[opalescence]], insensible to humidity, mechanical effects and severe atmosphere; very high quality of the product. Disadvantages: high cost of film and equipment, it is necessary to have autoclave, "clean" room, and qualified personnel.
*Photocurable polymers (resins) – so-called "filling technology". Major advantages: low cost of both resin and equipment. Only an [[ultraviolet]] furnace and a minimum of additional equipment is needed to produce laminated glass. Disadvantages: it is necessary to have qualified personnel for the work. Heating laminated glass that is produced with the help of this technology is insensible to humidity and temperature influence, has high [[shear strength]].

The '''holding current''' ('''hypostatic''') for electrical, electromagnetic and electronic devices is the minimum current which must pass through a circuit in order for it to remain in the 'ON' state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Graf, Rudolf F.|year=1999|chapter=holding current|title=Modern Dictionary of Electronics|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Newnes|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=uah1PkxWeKYC&amp;pg=PA348 348]|isbn=978-0-7506-9866-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leblanc"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Leblanc, E.|title=Thyristors and Triacs, an Important Parameter: The Holding Current|publisher=SGS-Thomson Microelectronics|url=http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheet/SGSThomsonMicroelectronics/mXyzyvx.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term can be applied to a single switch or to an entire device.  A simple example of holding current is in a [[Spark gap]].

In the most basic of circuits, if the current falls below the holding current even briefly, the circuit is turned 'OFF' (becomes blocked). However, complex circuits and devices may have different delays built-in between the time the current falls below this level and the time the device turns 'OFF'. Whether a device turns 'ON' when current is restored is a design issue.  The current necessary to restore the circuit to the 'ON' state, called the "threshold current" (See [[threshold voltage]]), may be much greater than the holding current, or only very slightly more.  Nevertheless, where the device is designed to turn back 'ON' upon restoration of the current and where the device is running at or about the holding current level, slight variations in the current can cause ''flicker'' as the device cycles 'OFF' and 'ON'.&lt;ref name="Leblanc" /&gt; If flicker is undesirable, it can be reduced by the use of capacitors or other circuits, on the other hand, flicker can be used to measure small events as in a [[Geiger–Müller tube]].

A related term is [[TRIAC#Gate threshold current, latching current and holding current|latching current]], which is the minimum additional current that can make up for any missing input (gate) current in order to keep the device 'ON', in other words to keep the device's internal structure latched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Thyristor Theory and Design Considerations: Handbook|publisher=ON Semiconductor|page=5|url=http://www.onsemi.com/pub/Collateral/HBD855-D.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the simplest case where the system only has two terminals, and the scattering matrix of the conductor does not depend on energy, the formula reads
:&lt;math&gt;

A '''leaf blower''' (often referred to as simply a '''blower''') is a gardening tool that propels air out of a [[nozzle]] to move [[debris]] such as [[leaves]] and [[grass]] cuttings.  Leaf blowers are powered by electric or gasoline motors. Gasoline models have traditionally been [[two-stroke engine]]s, but [[four-stroke engine]]s were recently introduced to partially address [[air pollution]] concerns. Leaf blowers are typically self-contained handheld units, or [[backpack]] mounted units with a handheld wand.  The latter is more [[ergonomic]] for prolonged use. Larger units may rest on wheels and even use a motor for propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leaf blowers|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/leaf-blowers.htm|publisher=Consumer Reports|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are sometimes called "walk behind leaf blowers" because they must be pushed by hand to be operated.

Some units can also suck in leaves and small twigs via a [[vacuum]], and shred them into a bag. In that role it is called a '''blower vac'''.

== Overview ==
[[File:Aa backpackleafblower.jpg|thumb|right|Backpack leaf blower]]
The leaf blower was invented by Dom Quinto in the 1950s.{{cn|date=November 2018}}  Drought conditions in [[California]] facilitated acceptance of the leaf blower as the use of water for many garden clean-up tasks was prohibited. Leaf blowers also save time compared to a [[broom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CLCA Position On Leaf Blowers|url=http://www.clca.org/leaf-blowers/index.php|publisher=California Landscape Contractors Association|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, annual sales were over 800,000 in the [[United States|U.S.]], and the tool had become a ubiquitous gardening implement.

Other functions beyond the simple use of garden maintenance have been demonstrated by [[Richard Hammond]] on the [[Brainiac: Science Abuse|Brainiac]] television series, in which a man sized [[hovercraft]] was constructed from a leaf blower.  Being both portable and able to generate wind speeds of between {{convert|140|-|270|mph|m/s}} and air volumes of 14 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per minute, the leaf blower has many potential uses in amateur construction projects. Some professional walk-behind leaf blowers can even reach air volumes of 100 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per minute (over 3800 CFM).

== Environmental and occupational impact ==
[[File:NoiseLevel LeafBlower.jpg|thumb|Noise level of a gas-powered leaf blower using the [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/app.html NIOSH Sound Level Meter app]]]
Emissions from [[gasoline engine|gasoline-powered]] grounds-keeping equipment in general are a source of [[air pollution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/air/community/details/yardequip.html |title=Lawn Equipment &amp;#124; Improving Air Quality in Your Community &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2009-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428102707/http://www.epa.gov/air/community/details/yardequip.html |archivedate=2009-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and more immediately (when powered by [[internal combustion engine]]s, rather than by electricity), [[noise pollution]]. In the United States, [[US emission standard]]s prescribe maximum emissions from small engines. The two-stroke engines used in most leaf blowers operate by mixing gasoline with oil, and a third of this mixture is not burned, but is emitted as an [[aerosol]] exhaust. These pollutants have been linked to [[cancer]], [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], and [[asthma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/leaf-blowers-are-loud-ugly-and-dangerous-1539903772|title=Leaf Blowers Are Loud, Ugly and Dangerous|last=Bernhard|first=Adrienne|date=October 18, 2018|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=October 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021044746/https://www.wsj.com/articles/leaf-blowers-are-loud-ugly-and-dangerous-1539903772|archive-date=October 21, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 study found that the pollutants emitted by a leaf blower operated for 30 minutes is comparable to the amount emitted by a [[Ford F-Series|Ford F-150]] pickup truck driving from [[Texas]] to [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/realestate/on-banning-on-leaf-blowers.html|title=On Banning Leaf Blowers|last=Kaysen|first=Ronda|date=March 17, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=October 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006085951/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/realestate/on-banning-on-leaf-blowers.html|archive-date=October 6, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the adverse health effects of [[carbon monoxide]], [[nitrogen oxides]], [[hydrocarbon]]s, and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] generated in the [[exhaust gas]] of the gasoline-powered engines, leaf blowers pose problems related to dust raised by the powerful flow of air. Dust clouds caused by leaf blowers contain potentially harmful substances such as pesticides, mold, and animal [[fecal matter]] that may cause irritation, allergies, and disease.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Noise pollution is also a concern with leaf blowers, as they emit noise levels well above those required to cause [[hearing loss]] to both the operator and those nearby.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Leaf blowers also present an occupational hearing hazard to the nearly 1 million people who work in lawn service and ground-keeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2018/07/25/landscape-noise1/|title=Grounds for Change: Reducing Noise Exposure in Grounds Management Professionals|last=NIOSH|first=|date=Jul 25, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Aug 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study assessed the occupational noise exposure among groundskeepers at several North Carolina public universities and found noise levels from leaf blowers averaging 89 decibels (A-weighted) and maximum sound pressure levels reaching 106 dB(A), both far exceeding the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ([[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|NIOSH]]) Recommended Exposure Limit of 85 dB(A) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balanay|first=Jo Anne G.|last2=Kearney|first2=Gregory D.|last3=Mannarino|first3=Adam J.|date=2016-06-13|title=Assessment of Occupational Noise Exposure among Groundskeepers in North Carolina Public Universities|journal=Environmental Health Insights|volume=10|pages=83–92|doi=10.4137/EHI.S39682|issn=1178-6302|pmc=4909058|pmid=27330303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bans ===
Soon after the leaf blower was introduced into the [[United States|U.S.]], its use was banned in two [[California]] cities, [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel-by-the-Sea]] in 1975 and [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] in 1978, as a noise nuisance. There are currently twenty California cities that have banned leaf blowers, sometimes only within residential neighborhoods and usually targeting gasoline-powered equipment. Another 80 cities have ordinances on the books restricting either usage or noise level or both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine-archive/2010/september/home-garden/leaf-blower/blower-noise/index.htm Leaf-blower regulations nationwide] Consumer Reports magazine, September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LevelUp''' is an American [[mobile ordering]] and [[mobile payments]] platform created by [[Boston, Massachusetts]]-based start-up [[SCVNGR]].&lt;ref name="Wong 2012"/&gt; The LevelUp platform connects restaurants and guests with a customer experience that blends analytics, loyalty, and rewards. LevelUp brings its technology to market in multiple ways: embedded into partner restaurant apps to provide a full-stack customer engagement solution; via an open developer platform powering over 200 mobile apps; and through LevelUp's partner distribution channels, which lets consumers order ahead and avoid the line at restaurants using the apps already on their [[iPhone]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones. On July 25, 2018, it was announced that LevelUp would be acquired for US$390 million by [[Grubhub]], an online food delivery platform&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/25/grubhub-acquires-levelup/|title=Grubhub acquires payments and loyalty company LevelUp for $390M|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-07-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

LevelUp was initially launched in March 2011&lt;ref name="Kirsner 2011"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kirsner | first=Scott | title=Test-driving SCVNGR's new LevelUp app for local discounts | website=[[Boston Globe]] | date=March 11, 2011 | url=http://archive.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2011/03/test-driving_scvngrs_new_level.html | accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operated for its first 3 months as a [[Deal of the Day (ecommerce)|daily deals]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2011/03/10/scvngr-levelup/ |title=SCVNGR Pilots New Hybrid Mobile App for Local Merchant Deals With Game Mechanics|author=Jennifer Van Grove |date=10 March 2011 |publisher=[[Mashable]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, LevelUp shifted away from the daily deal space to focus exclusively on their mobile payments solution.&lt;ref name="Sutter 2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/12/tech/innovation/levelup-new-york-launch/ |title=LevelUp app aims to keep coupon users coming back|author=Sutter, John D. |date=12 October 2011 |publisher=[[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, around 200,000 users and 3,000 companies were using LevelUp.&lt;ref name="Chen 2012"&gt;{{cite web | last=Chen | first=Brian X. | title=LevelUp Tries Dropping the Transaction Fee for Mobile Payments | website=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 12, 2012 | url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/levelup-zero-scvngr/ | accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, around 14,000 stores were using LevelUp.&lt;ref name="Shontell 2014"&gt;{{cite web | last=Shontell | first=Alyson | title=Payment Startup LevelUp Thinks It Has Found A Way To Charge Merchants A 0% Credit Card Processing Fee | website=[[Business Insider]] | date=April 16, 2014 | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/levelups-cheap-credit-card-processing-fee-heading-towards-0-2014-4 | accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017 they announced that they had raised $50 million in funding, with over 50,000 locations and more than 200 brands using Levelup.&lt;ref name="Ainger 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Ainger | first=Neil | title=LevelUp mobile app gets $50 million in latest fintech fundraising round | website=[[CNBC]] | date = May 16, 2017 | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/16/levelup-mobile-app-gets-50-million-in-latest-fintech-fundraising-round.html | accessdate=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The LevelUp mobile application for [[iPhone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Windows Phone]] allows registered users to securely link their debit or credit card to a unique QR code displayed within the app. To pay with LevelUp, users scan the QR code on their phone at LevelUp terminals located at local businesses who accept LevelUp as a form of payment.&lt;ref name="Wong 2012"/&gt;

Some merchants that accept LevelUp as a form of payment also offer monetary savings to users.&lt;ref name="Martinez 2011"&gt;{{cite web | last=Martinez | first=Edecio | title=LevelUp challenges Groupon's model with trio of deals | website=[[CBS News]] | date=August 29, 2011 | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/levelup-challenges-groupons-model-with-trio-of-deals/ | accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users are given “First-Time Visit Specials” the first time they make a transaction at the merchant's location. Users can also unlock "credit" to a merchant’s store after spending a certain amount at the merchant’s location.&lt;ref name="Sutter 2011"/&gt;

As of June 2016, LevelUp is available for businesses in the Boston,&lt;ref name="Kirsner 2011"/&gt; Chicago,&lt;ref name="Wong 2012"&gt;{{cite web | last=Wong | first=Wailin | title=Loyalty program LevelUp to launch in Chicago | date=February 16, 2012 | publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]''|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-02-16/business/chi-loyalty-program-levelup-to-launch-in-chicago-20120216_1_loyalty-program-mobile-payments-lightbank | accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington DC, Northern Virginia, Philadelphia,&lt;ref name="Sutter 2011"/&gt; St. Louis, New York City,&lt;ref name="Sutter 2011"/&gt; Atlanta, San Francisco,&lt;ref name="Sutter 2011"/&gt; Dallas, San Diego, Minneapolis, Montgomery, Kansas City, Seattle and Wilmington, NC areas.

In early 2018, the company announced the release of Broadcast, enabling restaurant brands to reach millions of new customers by allowing them to browse live menus, order ahead and pay directly from high traffic apps such as [[Facebook]], [[Facebook Messenger|Messenger]], [[Yelp]], [[Foursquare]], [[Amazon Alexa]] and [[Chase Pay]].

A '''milkman''' is a [[Delivery (commerce)|delivery]] person who delivers [[milk]], often directly to customers' houses, in [[milk bottle|bottle]]s or cartons.
==Delivery==

Milk was delivered to houses daily in some countries when a lack of good refrigeration meant milk would quickly spoil. Before [[milk bottles]] were available, milkmen took churns on their rounds and filled the customers' jugs by dipping a measure into the churn. The near-ubiquity of refrigerators in homes in the developed world, as well as improved packaging, has decreased the need for frequent milk delivery over the past half-century and made the trade shrink in many localities sometimes to just three days a week and disappear totally in others. Additionally, milk delivery incurs a small cost on the price of dairy products that is increasingly difficult to justify and leaves delivered milk in a position where it is vulnerable to theft.

Milk deliveries frequently occur in the morning and it is not uncommon for milkmen and milkwomen to deliver products other than milk such as eggs, cream, cheese, butter, yogurt, or [[soft drink]]s.

In some areas apartments and houses would have small milk delivery doors. A small wooden cabinet inside of the residence, built into the exterior wall, would have doors on both sides, latched but not locked. Milk or groceries could be placed in the box when delivered, and collected by the homeowner.

Truck drivers who transport milk from a farm to a milk processing plant are also known as milkmen or milkwomen. Raw milk is picked up daily, or every other day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/business/yourmoney/16milk.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=New York Times|publisher=www.nytimes.com|date=2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In various countries==
[[File:Melkboer.jpg|thumb|Dutch milkman in [[Haarlem]], 1956]]
From the 20th century, milk delivery in urban areas of [[Europe]] has been carried out from an electric vehicle called a [[milk float]]. These replaced [[horse]]-drawn vehicles, which were still seen in Britain in the 1950s, and parts of the United States until the 1960s. In [[Australia]], the delivery vehicle was usually a small petrol or diesel engined truck with a covered milk-tray. In hotter areas, this tray is usually insulated.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

In [[India]], those delivering milk usually use [[milk churn]]s, a practice that has ceased in western countries. On the road they are put on any kind of vehicle. In big cities such as [[Mumbai]], milk churns are often transported in luggage compartments in local trains.

In 2005, about 0.4% of consumers in the United States had their milk delivered, and a handful of newer companies had sprung up to offer the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/business/yourmoney/16milk.html?pagewanted=all|title=Remember the Milkman? In Some Places, He’s Back|last=Tahmincioglu|first=Eve|date=December 16, 2007|accessdate=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some U.S. dairies have been delivering milk for about a hundred years, with interest continuing to increase in the 2010s as part of the [[local food movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/02/13/the-milkman-back-hitching-ride-food-delivery-bandwagon/wf42fnx1dxbapD7JixuyMI/story.html Yes, you can still get milk delivered — and people are taking advantage]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Philippines]], the milkman or milkmaid is called ''lechero''. The tradition stemmed from the community production of [[carabao]] milk. The ''lechero'' delivers the fresh [[carabao]] milk to the [[barangay]] (village) of his or her designation. The ''lechero'' heritage used to be widely practiced in the country, however, declined after the introduction of store-bought milk during the American occupation period. Nowadays, only a few communities have ''lecheros'', notably in [[Nueva Ecija]] province, the milk capital of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EarWV1EHe-I&amp;t=0s&amp;index=5&amp;list=LLIU1nR8nSfujGRlyE95IN6A&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Uganda region an often used title for "king" is "Omukama", which means "superior milkman/milk bringer": a title that refers to the role of the leader as a feeder of the people and the historical tradition that the ancient ruling class of some Ugandan kingdoms was of [[Hema people|Hema]] stock, the Hema being cattle-holders.

{{History of printing}}

The '''stencil duplicator''' or '''mimeograph machine''' (often abbreviated to '''mimeo''') is a low-cost [[duplicating machines|duplicating machine]] that works by forcing ink through a [[stencil]] onto paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mimeograph|title=Mimeograph - Definition of Mimeograph by Merriam-Webster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mimeograph process should not be confused with the [[spirit duplicator]] process.

Mimeographs, along with spirit duplicators and [[hectograph]]s, were a common technology in printing small quantities, as in office work, classroom materials, and church bulletins. Early [[fanzines]] were printed with this technology, because it was widespread and cheap. In the late 1960s, mimeographs, spirit duplicators, and hectographs began to be gradually displaced by [[photocopying]].

==Origins==
Use of [[stencil]]s is an ancient art, but{{emdash}}through chemistry, papers, and presses{{emdash}}techniques advanced rapidly in the late nineteenth century:

===Papyrograph ===
A description of the Papyrograph method of duplication was published by David Owen:&lt;ref&gt; David Owen (2008) [https://books.google.ca/books?id=QbFobeCexgsC&amp;pg=PA42 Copies in Seconds], page 42, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], Google book preview&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;A major beneficiary of the invention of synthetic dyes was a document reproduction technique known as stencil duplicating. Its earliest form was invented in 1874 by Eugenio de Zuccato, a young Italian studying law in London, who called his device the Papyrograph.  Zuccato’s system involved writing on a sheet of varnished paper with caustic ink, which ate through the varnish and paper fibers, leaving holes where the writing had been. This sheet – which had now become a stencil – was placed on a blank sheet of paper, and ink rolled over it so that the ink oozed through the holes, creating a duplicate on the second sheet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The process was commercialized&lt;ref&gt;1878: [https://books.google.ca/books?id=tuLgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA390 Library Journal 3:390] Advertisement via Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officemuseum.com/copy_machines.htm Antique Copying Machines] from Office Museum&lt;/ref&gt; and Zuccato applied for a patent in 1895 having stencils prepared by typewriting.&lt;ref&gt;Eugenic de Zuccato (1895) [http://www.google.com/patents/US548116 Patent US548116]  Improvement for stencils from typewriting&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric pen===
{{Main|Electric pen}}

[[Thomas Edison]] received US patent 180,857 for '''Autographic Printing''' on August 8, 1876.&lt;ref&gt;http://edison.rutgers.edu/patents/00180857.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;  The patent covered the '''electric pen''', used for making the stencil, and the flatbed duplicating press. In 1880 Edison obtained a further patent, US 224,665: "Method of Preparing Autographic Stencils for Printing," which covered the making of stencils using a file plate, a grooved metal plate on which the stencil was placed which perforated the stencil when written on with a blunt metal stylus.&lt;ref&gt;http://edison.rutgers.edu/patents/00224665.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''mimeograph''' was first used by [[Albert Blake Dick]]&lt;ref&gt;http://edison.rutgers.edu/NamesSearch/SingleDoc.php3?DocId=CA035A&lt;/ref&gt; when he licensed Edison's patents in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;http://edison.rutgers.edu/NamesSearch/SingleDoc.php3?DocId=LB024149&lt;/ref&gt;

Dick received [[Trademark]] Registration no. 0356815 for the term "Mimeograph" in the US Patent Office. It is currently listed as a dead entry, but shows the [[A.B. Dick Company]] of [[Chicago]] as the owner of the name.

Over time, the term became generic and is now an example of a [[genericized trademark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/68/M0306800.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908113755/http://www.bartleby.com/61/68/M0306800.html|title=mimeograph. The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.|archivedate=8 September 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Roneograph," also "Roneo machine," was another trademark used for mimeograph machines, the name being a contraction of Rotary Neostyle.)

===Cyclostyle===
{{Main|Cyclostyle (copier)}}
 
In 1891, [[David Gestetner]] patented his '''Automatic Cyclostyle'''.  This was one of the first rotary machines that retained the flatbed, which passed back and forth under inked rollers.  This invention provided for more automated, faster reproductions since the pages were produced and moved by rollers instead of pressing one single sheet at a time.

By 1900, two primary types of mimeographs had come into use: a single-drum machine and a dual-drum machine.  The single-drum machine used a single drum for ink transfer to the stencil, and the dual-drum machine used two drums and silk-screens to transfer the ink to the stencils. The single drum (example Roneo) machine could be easily used for multi-color work by changing the drum - each of which contained ink of a different color. This was spot color for mastheads. Colors could not be mixed.

The mimeograph became popular because it was much cheaper than traditional print - there was neither [[typesetting]] nor skilled labor involved. One individual with a [[typewriter]] and the necessary equipment became his own printing factory, allowing for greater circulation of printed material.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Mimeography process==
The image transfer medium was originally a stencil made from [[wax]]ed [[Rice paper#Mulberry paper|mulberry paper]]. Later this became an immersion-coated long-fibre paper, with the coating being a plasticized nitrocellulose.  This flexible waxed or coated sheet is backed by a sheet of stiff card stock, with the two sheets bound at the top.

Once prepared, the stencil is wrapped around the ink-filled drum of the rotary machine. When a blank sheet of paper is drawn between the rotating drum and a pressure roller, ink is forced through the holes on the stencil onto the paper. Early flatbed machines used a kind of [[squeegee]]. The ink originally had a [[lanolin]] base.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chem.5677567.com/formula/mimeograph-ink-vehicle-formula.html Mimeograph Ink Vehicle Formula] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709153405/http://chem.5677567.com/formula/mimeograph-ink-vehicle-formula.html |date=2012-07-09 }} Chemical Industry&lt;/ref&gt; and later became an oil in water emulsion. This emulsion commonly used Turkey-Red Oil (Sulfated Castor Oil) which gives it a distinctive and heavy scent.

===Preparing stencils===
For printed copy, a stencil assemblage is placed in a [[typewriter]]. The part of the mechanism which lifts the [[typewriter ribbon|ribbon]] must be disabled so that the bare, sharp type element strikes the stencil directly. The impact of the type element displaces the coating, making the tissue paper permeable to the [[Mineral oil|oil]]-based [[ink]]. This is called "cutting a stencil."&lt;ref name=MimeoTypewriter&gt;{{cite web|title=How to prepare a mimeograph stencil by using a typewriter|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil2.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121016144524/http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil2.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-10-16|work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of specialized [[styluses]] were used on the stencil to render lettering, illustrations, or other artistic features by hand against a textured plastic backing plate.&lt;ref name=MimeoHand&gt;{{cite web|title=How to prepare a mimeograph stencil by hand|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil1.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20111022224825/http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil1.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-10-22|work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mistakes can be corrected by brushing them out with a specially formulated [[correction fluid]], and retyping once it has dried. ("Obliterine" was a popular brand of correction fluid in Australia and the United Kingdom.)&lt;ref name=MimeoCorrect&gt;{{cite web|title=How to correct a mimeograph stencil|url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtocorrectamimeographstencil.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121016144730/http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtocorrectamimeographstencil.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-10-16|work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stencils were also made with a thermal process; an infrared method similar to that used by early photocopiers. The common machine was a [[Thermofax]].

Another device, called an [[electrostencil]] machine, sometimes was used to make mimeo stencils from a typed or printed original. It worked by scanning the original on a rotating drum with a moving optical head and burning through the blank stencil with an [[electric spark]] in the places where the optical head detected ink. It was slow and produced [[ozone]]. Text from electrostencils had lower resolution than that from typed stencils, although the process was good for reproducing illustrations. A skilled mimeo operator using an electrostencil and a very coarse [[halftone]] screen could make acceptable printed copies of a photograph.

During the declining years of the mimeograph, some people made stencils with early computers and [[dot matrix printer|dot-matrix impact printers]].&lt;ref name=MimeoDotMatrix&gt;{{cite web|title=How to prepare a mimeograph stencil by using a dot matrix printer |url=http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080213121240/http://www.sil.org/lingualinks/literacy/implementaliteracyprogram/howtoprepareamimeographstencil.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-02-13 |work=LinguaLinks Library|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
Unlike [[spirit duplicator]]s (where the only ink available is depleted from the master image), mimeograph technology works by forcing a replenishable supply of ink through the stencil master.  In theory, the mimeography process could be continued indefinitely, especially if a durable stencil master were used (e.g. a thin metal foil).  In practice, most low-cost mimeo stencils gradually wear out over the course of producing several hundred copies.  Typically the stencil deteriorates gradually, producing a characteristic degraded image quality until the stencil tears, abruptly ending the print run.  If further copies are desired at this point, another stencil must be made.

Often, the stencil material covering the interiors of closed [[letterform]]s (e.g. "a", "b", "d", "e", "g", etc.) would fall away during continued printing, causing ink-filled letters in the copies.  The stencil would gradually stretch, starting near the top where the mechanical forces were greatest, causing a characteristic "mid-line sag" in the textual lines of the copies, that would progress until the stencil failed completely.  The [[Gestetner]] Company (and others) devised various methods to make mimeo stencils more durable.&lt;ref name=DupStencil&gt;{{cite web |title=Duplicating stencil |url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4535690/description.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130421191131/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/4535690/description.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-04-21 |work=Patentstorm |accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to spirit duplication, mimeography produced a darker, more legible image.  Spirit duplicated images were usually tinted a light purple or lavender, which gradually became lighter over the course of some dozens of copies.  Mimeography was often considered "the next step up" in quality, capable of producing hundreds of copies.  Print runs beyond that level were usually produced by professional printers or, as the technology became available, [[xerography|xerographic copiers]].

==Durability==
Mimeographed images generally have much better durability than spirit-duplicated images, since the inks are more resistant to [[ultraviolet light]].  The primary preservation challenge is the low-quality paper often used, which would yellow and degrade due to [[slow fire|residual acid]] in the treated pulp from which the paper was made. In the worst case, old copies can crumble into small particles when handled. Mimeographed copies have moderate durability when [[acid-free paper]] is used.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Contemporary use==

[[Gestetner]], [[Risograph]], and other companies still make and sell highly automated mimeograph-like machines that are externally similar to photocopiers. The modern version of a mimeograph, called a [[digital duplicator]], or [[copyprinter]], contains a [[image scanner|scanner]], a thermal head for stencil cutting, and a large roll of stencil material entirely inside the unit. The stencil material consists of a very thin polymer film laminated to a long-fibre non-woven tissue.  It makes the stencils and mounts and unmounts them from the print drum automatically, making it almost as easy to operate as a photocopier. The Risograph is the best known of these machines.

Although mimeographs remain more economical and energy-efficient in mid-range quantities, easier-to-use photocopying and offset printing have replaced mimeography almost entirely in [[developed country|developed countries]]. Mimeograph machines continue to be used in [[developing country|developing countries]] because it is a simple, cheap, and robust technology. Many mimeographs can be hand-cranked, requiring no electricity.

==Uses and art==
Mimeographs and the closely related but distinctly different [[spirit duplicator]] process were both used extensively in schools to copy homework assignments and tests.  They were also commonly used for low-budget amateur [[publishing]], including club newsletters and church bulletins. They were especially popular with [[science fiction]] fans, who used them extensively in the production of [[fanzine]]s in the middle 20th century, before photocopying became inexpensive.

Letters and typographical symbols were sometimes used to create illustrations, in a precursor to [[ASCII art]]. Because changing ink color in a mimeograph could be a laborious process, involving extensively cleaning the machine or, on newer models, replacing the drum or rollers, and then running the paper through the machine a second time, some fanzine publishers experimented with techniques for painting several colors on the pad, notably [[Shelby Vick]], who created a kind of plaid "Vicolor".{{cn|date=February 2015}}

The '''motion history image''' (MHI) is a static image template helps in understanding the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] location and path as it progresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/CVL/Research/MHI/mhi.html | title=Research: Motion History Images | accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In MHI, the temporal motion information is collapsed into a single image template where intensity is a function of recency of motion. Thus, the MHI pixel intensity is a function of the motion history at that location, where brighter values correspond to a more recent motion. Using MHI, moving parts of a [[video]] sequence can be engraved with a single image, from where one can predict the motion flow as well as the moving parts of the video action.

Some important features of the MHI representation are:&lt;ref&gt;Ahad, Md Atiqur Rahman. Motion history images for action recognition and understanding. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It represents motion sequence in a compact manner. In this case, the [[silhouette]] sequence is condensed into a [[grayscale]] image, where dominant motion information is preserved. 
* MHI can be created and implemented in low illumination conditions where the structure cannot be easily detected otherwise. 
* The MHI representation is not so sensitive to silhouette noises, holes, shadows, and missing parts. 
* The gray-scale MHI is sensitive to the direction of motion because it can demonstrate the flow direction of the motion. 
* It keeps a history of temporal changes at each pixel location, which then decays over time. 
* The MHI expresses the motion flow or sequence by using the intensity of every pixel in a temporal manner.

'''Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification ''' ('''MLPA''')[http://www.mlpa.com] is a variation of the multiplex [[polymerase chain reaction]] that permits amplification of multiple targets with only a single [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]] pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schouten JP, McElgunn CJ, Waaijer R, Zwijnenburg D, Diepvens F, Pals G |year= 2002|title=Relative quantification of 40 nucleic acid sequences by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification|journal=Nucleic Acids Res.|volume=30|pages=e57|pmid= 12060695|doi=10.1093/nar/gnf056|issue=12 |pmc=117299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:MLPA_in_GeneMarker.jpg|thumb|400x400px|Example of [[exon]] deletions detected by Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification in a [[Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy]] patient.]]
Each probe consists of two oligonucleotides which recognize adjacent target sites on the [[DNA]]. One probe oligonucleotide contains the [[sequence (biology)|sequence]] recognized by the forward primer, the other contains the sequence recognized by the reverse primer. Only when both probe oligonucleotides are hybridized to their respective targets, can they be [[Ligase|ligated]] into a complete probe.  The advantage of splitting the probe into two parts is that only the ligated oligonucleotides, but not the unbound probe oligonucleotides, are amplified. If the probes were not split in this way, the primer sequences at either end would cause the probes to be amplified regardless of their hybridization to the template DNA, and the amplification product would not be dependent on the number of target sites present in the sample DNA. Each complete probe has a unique length, so that its resulting [[amplicon]]s can be separated and identified by (capillary) [[Gel electrophoresis|electrophoresis]]. This avoids the resolution limitations of [[multiplex PCR]]. Because the forward primer used for probe amplification is [[fluorescent]]ly labeled, each amplicon generates a fluorescent peak which can be detected by a capillary sequencer. Comparing the peak pattern obtained on a given sample with that obtained on various reference samples, the relative quantity of each amplicon can be determined. This ratio is a measure for the ratio in which the target sequence is present in the sample DNA.

Various techniques including DGGE ([[Dgge|Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis]]), DHPLC ([[SNP genotyping|Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography]]), and SSCA (Single Strand Conformation Analysis) effectively identify SNPs and small insertions and deletions. MLPA, however, is one of the only accurate, time-efficient techniques to detect genomic deletions and insertions (one or more entire exons), which are frequent causes of cancers such as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ([[HNPCC]]), breast, and ovarian cancer.  MLPA can successfully and easily determine the relative copy number of all exons within a gene simultaneously with high sensitivity.

== Relative ploidy ==
An important use of MLPA is to determine relative [[ploidy]]. For example, probes may be designed to target various regions of [[chromosome 21]] of a human cell.  The signal strengths of the probes are compared with those obtained from a reference DNA sample known to have two copies of the chromosome. If an extra copy is present in the test sample, the signals are expected to be 1.5 times the intensities of the respective probes from the reference. If only one copy is present the proportion is expected to be 0.5. If the sample has two copies, the relative probe strengths are expected to be equal.

== Dosage quotient analysis ==
Dosage quotient analysis is the usual method of interpreting MLPA data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yau SC, Bobrow M, Mathew CG, Abbs SJ |year= 1996|title=Accurate diagnosis of carriers of deletions and duplications in Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy by fluorescent dosage analysis|journal=J. Med. Genet.|volume=33|pages=550&amp;ndash;558|pmid= 8818939 |doi=10.1136/jmg.33.7.550|issue=7 |pmc=1050661}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a and b are the signals from two amplicons in the patient sample, and A and B are the corresponding amplicons in the experimental control, then the dosage quotient DQ = (a/b) / (A/B). Although dosage quotients may be calculated for any pair of amplicons, it is usually the case that one of the pair is an internal reference probe.

==  Applications ==
MLPA facilitates the amplification and detection of multiple targets with a single primer pair. In a standard multiplex PCR reaction, each fragment needs a unique amplifying primer pair. These primers being present in a large quantity result in various problems such as dimerization and false priming. With MLPA, amplification of probes can be achieved. Thus, many sequences (up to 40) can be amplified and quantified using just a single primer pair.  MLPA reaction is fast, inexpensive and very simple to perform.

MLPA has a variety of applications&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrc-holland.com/pages/article_pagepag.html List of MLPA related articles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220192914/http://www.mrc-holland.com/pages/article_pagepag.html |date=2007-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including detection of [[mutation]]s and [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Volikos E, Robinson J, Aittomaki K, Mecklin JP, Jarvinen H, Westerman AM, de Rooji FW, Vogel T, Moeslein G, Launonen V, Tomlinson IP, Silver AR, Aaltonen LA |year=2006|title=LKB1 exonic and whole gene deletions are a common cause of Peutz‐Jeghers syndrome|journal=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4698">The term '''natural mapping'''  comes from proper and natural arrangements for the relations between controls and their movements to the outcome from such action into the world.  The real function of natural mappings is to reduce the need for any information from a user’s memory to perform a task. This term is widely used in the areas of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) and [[interactive design]].&lt;ref name="DOETpage75"&gt;Norman, Donald A., "Knowledge in the Head and in the World". [[The Design of Everyday Things]]. New York: Basic Book, 1988. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mapping versus natural mapping ==

Mapping and natural mapping are very similar in that they are both used in relationship between controls and their movements and the result in the world. The only difference is that natural mapping provides users with properly organized controls for which users will immediately understand which control will perform which action.&lt;ref name="DOETpage75"/&gt;

'''A simple design principle:'''

{{cquote|If a design depends upon labels, it may be faulty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://citrusbits.com/user-stories-foundation-ui-design/ A Foundation For a perfect UI Design] by CitrusBits (March 20, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Labels are important and often necessary, but the appropriate use of natural mappings can minimize the need for them. Wherever labels seem necessary, consider another design.&lt;ref name="DOETpage78"&gt;Norman, Donald A., "Knowledge in the Head and in the World". [[The Design of Everyday Things]]. New York: Basic Book, 1988. 78&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Example of poor mapping and good mapping: kitchen stove ==

Consider, by way of example, the use of labelling on kitchen stoves with different arrangements of burners and controls.

=== Poor mapping: arbitrary arrangement of stove controls&lt;ref name="DOETpage77"&gt;Norman, Donald A., "Knowledge in the Head and in the World". [[The Design of Everyday Things]]. New York: Basic Book, 1988. 77&lt;/ref&gt; ===

[[Image:Old-style-kitchen-stove.jpg|thumb|none|300px|Kitchen stove with arbitrary controls in a row]]

In the above case, an arbitrary arrangement of controls, such as controls in a row, even though the burners are arranged in a rectangle, thereby visually frustrating the inexperienced user, leading to a period of experimenting with the controls to become familiar with the proper usage, and potential danger to the user.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooper.com/insights/journal_of_design/articles/dont_get_burned_by_bad_mapping_1.html “Don’t Get Burned by Bad Mapping”] by Wayne Greenwood&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Good mapping: full natural mapping of controls and burners&lt;ref name="DOETpage77"/&gt; ===

[[Image:Stove-square.jpg|thumb|none|300px|Kitchen stove with full natural mapping of Controls]]

=== Issues with the Stove metaphor: Moving to a theoretical understanding of Mapping ===

In the stove metaphor there is an illustration of placement in relation to the controls; however, the effect of the control in relation to its operation is Heat as a result of Rotation.  Rotation does not naturally relate to heat, therefore the relationship is artificial, and a social construction. A better example would be the simple one of a privacy bolt on a toilet stall.  A simple slide bolt with a knob has a very direct mapping, whereas, one with a rotating lever requires the understanding of the transformation of the rotation translated into the movement of the bolt horizontally.  From this perspective, mapping is a characteristic of affordance. A deeper understanding of many our perceived 'natural' mapping relationships uncovers a predominately socially constructed, or cultural, underpinning.  Such as rotating a volume knob to make the music volume go 'up'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-49407-4_7 “Marshall McLuhan, Affordance, Mapping, and Human Computer Interaction in Interactive Media”] by Robert Wellington&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noble Corporation plc''' is an [[offshore drilling]] contractor organized in [[London, United Kingdom]]. Its affiliate, Noble Corporation, is organized in the [[Cayman Islands]]. It is the corporate successor of '''Noble Drilling Corporation'''.

==Current Operations==
The company operates 28 drilling rigs including 8 [[drillship]]s, 6 [[Semi-submersible platform]]s and 14 [[jackup rig]]s.&lt;ref name=10K/&gt;

In 2017, revenues from [[Royal Dutch Shell]] accounted for 45.0% of the company's revenues, revenues from [[Statoil]] accounted for 13.2% of the company's revenues, and revenues from [[Saudi Aramco]] accounted for 11.4% of the company's revenues.&lt;ref name=10K/&gt;

==History==
In 1985, Noble Affiliates, Inc. (now [[Noble Energy]]), distributed its shares in Noble Drilling Corporation to its shareholders via a [[corporate spin-off]] and Noble Affiliates began publicly trading on the NASDAQ.

In 2002, the company underwent a restructuring whereby it moved its domicile to the [[Cayman Islands]] and established Noble Corporation as the parent holding company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=98046&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=253958 | title=Noble Drilling Corporation Approves Corporate Restructuring | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=January 31, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2009, the company moved its domicile from the [[Cayman Islands]] to [[Switzerland]] due to the potential for more U.S. taxes on Caribbean [[tax haven]]s. In 2013, the company moved to the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-noblecorp-incorporation-uk/noble-corp-changing-countries-again-this-time-to-uk-idUKBRE96018420130701 | title=Noble Corp changing countries again, this time to UK | first=Braden | last=Reddall | work=[[Reuters]] | date=July 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the company acquired Frontier Drilling in a $2.16 billion cash transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/noble-corporation-enters-into-agreement-to-acquire-frontier-drilling-and-strengthens-key-strategic-relationship-97293199.html8 | title=Noble Corporation Enters Into Agreement to Acquire Frontier Drilling and Strengthens Key Strategic Relationship | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was added to the [[S&amp;P 500 Index]] in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/2011/01/12/noble-commscope-qlogic-s.html | title=S&amp;P 500 Reshuffling To Include Noble Corp. | deadurl=no | accessdate=6 July 2012 | work=[[Forbes]] | date=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was removed from the index in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paypal-holdings-set-to-join-sp-100--500-others-to-join-sp-midcap-400-and-sp-smallcap-600-300113315.html | title=PayPal Holdings Set to Join S&amp;P 100 &amp; 500; Others to Join S&amp;P MidCap 400 and S&amp;P SmallCap 600 | publisher=[[PR Newswire]] | date=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the company distributed its interests in Paragon Offshore plc to its shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/noble-corporation-completes-spin-off-of-paragon-offshore-269804351.html | title=Noble Corporation Completes Spin-Off Of Paragon Offshore | publisher=[[PRNewswire]] | date=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidents and incidents===
====Noble Discoverer mooring (2012)====
In 2012, the Noble Discoverer drillship, operating under contract for [[Royal Dutch Shell]] lost its mooring and drifted close to shore. There were no injuries or environmental damage reported as a result of the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/7293655/Shell-Oil-ship-mishap-in-Alaska-fuels-concerns | title=Shell Oil ship mishap in Alaska fuels concerns | first=RACHEL | last=D'ORO | work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] | date=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''party hat''' is generally a playful [[Pointed hat|conical hat]] made with a rolled up piece of thin [[Paperboard|cardboard]], usually with designs printed on the outside and a long string of elastic acting like a chinstrap, going from one side of the cone's bottom to another to secure the cone to the person's [[head]]. Its name originates with its use:  Party hats are worn most often at [[party#Birthday party|birthday parties]], especially by the guest of honor, with a significant minority being worn for [[New Year's Eve|New Year celebrations]]. In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] the hat is made of [[paper]] and is the shape of a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], and is most typically worn during a [[Christmas dinner]]. The party hat has its origins in the [[dunce cap]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} worn by misbehaving or poorly performing schoolchildren from the mid-19th century to the early 20th century, with its festive decoration and society's positive attitude toward the wearer indicating a relaxation, abrogation, or even reversal of certain [[social norm]]s: During the occasion in question, the wearer is permitted or encouraged to engage, rather than discouraged from engaging, in frivolous and foolish behavior for which the required wearing of the dunce cap would in other situations constitute a [[punishment]].
Party hats have originated in England 

Non-conical hats worn to signify an occasion's informal and festive status include decorated [[top hat]]s, hats made from [[balloon]]s, the [[beer]] hat or "beer helmet" (invented in 1983 by [[Buffalo Bills]] fan Jeremy Gumbo), and [[Mickey Mouse]] ears. In more extreme cases, partygoers may wear other objects such as [[lampshade]]s or beer boxes, although the wearing of such objects often meets with social disapproval.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

'''Poudre B''' was the first practical [[smokeless powder|smokeless]] [[gunpowder]]. It was perfected between 1882 and 1884 at "Laboratoire Central des Poudres et Salpêtres" in Paris, France. Originally called "Poudre V", from the name of the inventor, [[Paul Vieille]], it was arbitrarily renamed "Poudre B" (short for ''poudre blanche'' -- white powder, as distinguished from [[gunpowder|black powder]]) to distract German espionage.&lt;ref name="Chemistry289"&gt;Davis, Tenney L. ''The Chemistry of Powder &amp; Explosives'' (1943) pages 289–292&lt;/ref&gt; "Poudre B" is made from 68.2% insoluble [[nitrocellulose]], 29.8% soluble nitrocellulose gelatinized with [[diethyl ether|ether]] and 2% paraffin.  "Poudre B" is made up of very small paper-thin flakes that are not white but dark greenish grey in color. "Poudre B" was first used to load the [[8mm Lebel]] cartridges issued in 1886 for the [[Lebel rifle]].

==History==
French chemist Paul Vieille had followed the findings of German-Swiss chemist [[Christian Friedrich Schonbein]], who had created the explosive [[nitrocellulose]] or "[[guncotton]]" in 1846 by treating cotton fibers with a nitric acid and sulphuric acid mixture. However guncotton, an explosive substance, proved to be too fast burning at the time for direct use in firearms and artillery ammunition. Then [[Paul Vieille]] went one step further in 1882-84 and, after many trials and errors, succeeded in transforming [[guncotton]] into a colloidal substance by gelatinizing it in an alcohol-ether mixture which he then stabilized with [[amyl alcohol]]. He then used roller presses to transform this gelatinized colloidal substance into extremely thin sheets which, after drying, were cut up into small flakes. This single-base smokeless powder was originally named "Poudre V" after the inventor's name. That denomination was later changed arbitrarily to "Poudre B" in order to distract German espionage. The original "Poudre B" of 1884 was almost immediately replaced by improved "Poudre BF(NT)" in 1888. In 1896 "Poudre BF(NT)" was replaced by "Poudre BF(AM)" which was followed by "Poudre BN3F" in 1901. The latter was stabilized with the antioxidant [[diphenylamine]] instead of amyl alcohol and it gave safe and regular performance as the standard French gunpowder used during  World War I (1914–1918). It was followed during the 1920s by "Poudre BN3F(Ae)" and later by "Poudre BPF1", which remained in service until the 1960s.

==Performance==
Three times more powerful than [[black powder]] for the same weight, and not generating large quantities of smoke, "Poudre B" gave the user a huge tactical advantage. It was hastily adopted by the French military in 1886, followed by all the major military powers within a few years.

Prior to its introduction, a squad of [[soldier]]s firing volleys would be unable to see their targets after a few shots, while their own location would be obvious because of the cloud of [[smoke]] hanging over them. The higher power of the new powder gave a higher muzzle velocity, which in turn produced a flatter bullet trajectory and thus a longer range. It also required lesser volumes of gunpowder and allowed a smaller caliber, thus lighter bullets, so a soldier could carry more ammunition. The French Army quickly introduced a new rifle, the [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|Lebel Model 1886]] firing a new 8&amp;nbsp;mm calibre cartridge, to exploit these benefits.

==Stability and safety==
The earliest "Poudre B" tended to eventually become unstable, which has been attributed to evaporation of the volatile solvents, but may also have been due to the difficulty in fully removing the acids used to make guncotton. In the early years of their use both the original Poudre B and guncotton led to accidents. For example, two French [[battleship]]s, the [[French battleship Iéna|''Iéna'']] and the [[French battleship Liberté|''Liberté'']], blew up in [[Toulon]] harbour in 1907 and 1911 respectively with heavy loss of life. By the end of the 1890s, safer smokeless powders had been developed, including improved and stabilized versions of "Poudre B" (e.g. Poudres BN3F and BPF1), [[ballistite]] and [[cordite]]. The guncotton problem is not completely solved even today, as an occasional batch of smokeless powder will still deteriorate, although this is extremely rare.

'''Powel Crosley Jr.''' (September 18, 1886 – March 28, 1961) was an [[United States|American]] [[inventor]], [[industrialist]], and [[entrepreneur]]. He was also a pioneer in [[radio]] [[broadcasting]], and a former owner of the [[Cincinnati Reds]] major league [[baseball]] team. In addition, Crosley's companies manufactured [[Crosley]] [[automobile]]s and radios, and operated [[WLW]] radio station. Crosley, once dubbed "The Henry Ford of Radio," was inducted into the [[Automotive Hall of Fame]] in 2010 and the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]] in 2013.

He and his brother, [[Lewis M. Crosley]], were responsible for many firsts in consumer products and broadcasting. During [[World War II]], Crosley's facilities produced more [[proximity fuze]]s than any other U.S. manufacturer, and made several production design innovations. [[Crosley Field]], a stadium in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], was renamed for him, and the street-level main entrance to [[Great American Ball Park]] in Cincinnati is named Crosley Terrace in his honor. Crosley's [[Pinecroft]] estate home in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], and [[Friends of Seagate Inc.#Seagate since 1925 plat|Seagate]], his former winter retreat in [[Sarasota, Florida]] are listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

==Early life and education==
Powel Crosley Jr. was born on September 18, 1886, in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Hamilton County, Ohio]], to Charlotte Wooley (Utz) (1864–1949) and Powel Crosley Sr. (1849–1932), a lawyer. Powel Jr. was the oldest of the family's four children that included a brother, [[Lewis M. Crosley|Lewis]], and two sisters, Charlotte and Edythe.&lt;ref name=PCgrave&gt;{{cite web| author=| title =Powel Crosley | work = | publisher = Find A Grave | date = | url = https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/4444/powel-crosley | format = | accessdate =May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosley became interested in the mechanics of [[automobile]]s at a young age and wanted to become an automaker. While living with his family in College Hill, a suburb of Cincinnati, twelve-year-old Crosley made his first attempt at building a vehicle.&lt;ref name=BigDream28-29&gt;{{cite journal| author=Michael A. Banks | title =Big Dream, Small Car: Powel Crosley Jr.'s Indiana Automobile | journal =Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =19 | issue =2 | pages =28–29| publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | date =Spring 2007| url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crosley began high school in College Hill and transferred to the [[Ohio Military Institute]]. In 1904 Crosley enrolled at the [[University of Cincinnati]], where he began studies in engineering, but switched to law, primarily to satisfy his father, before dropping out of college in 1906 after two years of study.&lt;ref name=BigDream28-29/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Crosley married Gwendolyn Bakewell Aiken (1889–1939) in Hamilton County, Ohio, on October 17, 1910. They had two children, Powel Crosley III (1911–1948) and Martha Page Crosley (1912–1994).&lt;ref name=PCgrave/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&amp;query=%2Bgivenname%3Apowel~%20%2Bsurname%3Acrosley~%20%2Bspouse_givenname%3Agwendolyn~%20%2Bspouse_surname%3Aaiken~ |title=Powel Crosley search results |publisher=FamilySearch.org |date= |accessdate=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his marriage, Crosley continued to work in automobile sales in Muncie to earn money to buy a house, while his wife returned to Cincinnati to live with her parents. The young couple saw each other on the weekends until Crosley returned to Cincinnati in 1911 to live and work after the birth of his first child.&lt;ref name=BigDream30-31/&gt; Gwendolyn Crosley, who suffered from [[tuberculosis]], died at the Crosleys' winter home in [[Sarasota, Florida]], on February 26, 1939.&lt;ref name=NRPH-Seagate&gt;{{Cite web |author=Michael Zimny and Sarah Kearns |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory––Nomination Form: Seagate | work = |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service |date=January 21, 1983 |url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/AssetDetail?assetID=cbfaf743-13ef-4a25-a395-3958ffc8c96b|format=pdf | accessdate =May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| title =Gwendolyn Bakewell Crosley | work = | publisher = Find A Grave | date = | url =https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11550662/gwendolyn-bakewell-crosley | format = | accessdate =May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crosley married Eva Emily Brokaw (1912–1955) in 1952. She died in Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= | title =Eva Emily Crosley | work = | publisher =Find A Grave | date = | url = https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11550661/eva-emily-crosley | format =  | accessdate =May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real estate==
Crosley's primary residence was [[Pinecroft]], an estate home built in 1929 in the [[Mount Airy, Cincinnati|Mount Airy]] section of Cincinnati, Ohio. He also had [[Seagate (Manatee County, Florida)|Seagate]], a winter retreat in [[Manatee County, Florida]], built for his first wife, Gwendolyn. In addition, Crosley owned several vacation properties.

===Pinecroft===
{{Main|Pinecroft}}

Pinecroft, Crosley's two-story, {{convert|13334|ft2|m2|adj=on}}, [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]]-style mansion and other buildings on his estate in Mount Airy was designed by [[New York City|New York]]-based architect [[Dwight James Baum]] and built in 1928–29. Crosley's daughter, Marth Page (Crosley) Kess, sold the property after her father's death in 1961, and the [[Franciscan Sisters of the Poor]] acquired the property in 1963. Saint Francis Hospital bought a portion of the property north of the Crosley mansion in 1971 and built a hospital, which was renamed Mercy Hospitals West in 2001. The land surrounding the home has been subdivided into parcels, but the Franciscan Sisters have used the mansion as a retreat since the early 1970s. Pinecroft was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=NRHP-Pinecroft&gt;{{cite web|author=Beth Sullebarger |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Pinecroft | work =|publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service | date =December 17, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/feature/weekly_features/Pinecroft.pdf | format =pdf | accessdate =May 8, 2018}} See also:

===Seagate===
{{Main|Seagate (Manatee County, Florida)}}
[[Image:Sarasota FL Seagate Estate01.jpg|thumb|150px|Seagate]]

Seagate, also known as the Bay Club, along [[Sarasota Bay]] in the southwest corner of [[Manatee County, Florida]], was a [[Mediterranean Revival style|Mediterranean Revival-style]] home designed for Crosley by [[New York City]] and [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]] architect [[George Albree Freeman Jr.]], with [[Ivo A. de Minicis]], a [[Tampa, Florida]], architect, drafting the plans. Sarasota contractor [[Paul W. Bergman]] built the {{convert|11000|ft2|m2|adj=on}} winter retreat in 1929-30 on a {{Convert|63|acre|hectare|adj=on}} parcel of land. The two-and-a-half-story house include ten bedrooms and ten bathrooms, as well as auxiliary garages and living quarters for staff. The house contains and is reportedly the first residence built in Florida using [[steel]]-frame construction to provide protection against fires and [[hurricane]]s.  After Crosley's wife, Gwendolyn, died of tuberculosis at the retreat in 1939, he rarely used the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=LaHurd, Jeff |title=Powel Crosley Jr. remembered as a visionary |location=Sarasota, Florida|journal=Herald Tribune |date=November 15, 2015 |page=B-1 |url=

According to early official county documents and grandson Lewis L. Crosley's birth certificate, the name was spelled on early documents as two words, Sea Gate, but has become contracted in use over the years, including the name of the street leading to the building which was renamed as, Seagate Drive.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], Crosley allowed the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] to use the retreat its airmen training at the nearby Sarasota Army Air Base. Crosley sold his estate property in 1947 to the D and D Corporation.&lt;ref name=NRHP-Pinecroft/&gt;

Mabel and [[Freeman Horton]] purchased the property in 1948 and owned Seagate for nearly forty years. The house and {{convert|45|acre|hectare}} was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on January 21, 1983, by a subsequent owner who intended to build an exclusive [[condominium]] project on the site using the historic house as a clubhouse, but the project failed when the economy faltered shortly thereafter. [[Kafi Benz]], the [[Friends of Seagate|Friends of Seagate Inc.]], a nonprofit corporation, and local residents saved Seagate from commercial development, and initiated a campaign for its preservation and public acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Sarasota Magazine, May 1, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 the state of Florida purchased the property and {{convert|16.5|acre|hectare}} of the bay-front estate that included the structures that Crosley had built in 1929-30. A larger portion of the original property was developed into a satellite campus for the [[University of South Florida]]. The [[University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee]] campus opened its new facilities in August 2006. The present-day mansion, called the Powel Crosley Estate, is used as a meeting, conference, and event venue.&lt;ref name=NRHP-Pinecroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=PCEstate&gt;{{cite web| author= | title =Powel Crosley Estate: Rental Info and Rates | work = | publisher =Bradenton Area Convention and Visitor's Bureau | date = | url =https://www.bradentongulfislands.com/special-event-services/crosley-estate/rental-info-and-rates | format = | accessdate =May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USFSM-Facilities&gt;{{cite web| author= | title =Facilities planning and management | work = | publisher =University of South Florida Sarasota-Manatee | date = | url =http://www.usfsm.edu/faculty-and-staff/facilities-planning-and-management/usfsm-campus.aspx | format = | accessdate =May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vacation homes===
Crosley, an avid sportsman, also owned several sports, hunting, and fishing camps, including an island retreat called Nikassi on [[Rainbow Country#McGregor Bay|McGregor Bay]], [[Lake Huron]], [[Canada]]; [[Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge|Bull Island, South Carolina]]; Pimlico Plantation, along the [[Cooper River (South Carolina)|Cooper River]] north of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]; Sleepy Hollow Farm, a retreat in [[Jennings County, Indiana]] and a house at [[Cat Cays]], [[Bahamas]].&lt;ref name=NRPH-Seagate/&gt;&lt;ref name=NRHP-Pinecroft/&gt;

==Early career==
Crosley began work selling bonds for an [[investment banking|investment banker]]; however, at the age of twenty-one he decided to pursue a career in automobile manufacturing.&lt;ref name=BigDream28-29/&gt; The [[mass production|mass-production]] techniques employed by [[Henry Ford]] also caught his attention and would be implemented by his brother, Lewis, when the two began manufacturing radios in 1921.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In 1907 Crosley formed a company to build the Marathon Six, a [[multi-cylinder engine|six-cylinder]] model priced at $1,700, which was at the low end of the luxury car market. With $10,000 in capital that he raised from investors, Crosley established Marathon Six Automotive inexpensive automobile, in [[Connersville, Indiana]], and built a [[prototype]] of his car, but a nationwide financial panic caused investment capital to dwindle and he failed to fund its production.&lt;ref name=BigDream29-30&gt;Banks, "Big Dream, Small Car," pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still determined to establish himself as an automaker, Crosley moved to [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], where he worked for [[Carl G. Fisher]] as a shop hand at the [[Fisher Automobile Company]]. Crosley stayed for about a year, but left after he broke his arm starting a car at the auto dealership. After recovering from his injury at home in College Hill, Crosley returned to Indianapolis in 1909 to briefly work for several auto manufacturers, including jobs as an assistant sales manager for the [[Parry Auto Company]] and a salesman for the [[National Motor Vehicle Company]]. He also volunteered to help promote National's auto racing team. His next job was selling advertising for ''Motor Vehicle'', an automotive trade journal, but left in 1910 to move to [[Muncie, Indiana]], where he worked in sales for the [[Inter-State Automobile Company]] and promoted its racing team.&lt;ref name=BigDream30-31&gt;Banks, "Big Dream, Small Car," pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early automobile and parts manufacturer==
After returning to Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1911, Crosley sold and wrote advertisements for local businesses, but continued to pursue his interests in the automobile industry. He 
failed in early efforts to manufacture cars for the Hermes Automobile Company and cyclecars for the De Cross Cyclecar Company and the L. Porter Smith and Brothers Company before finding financial success in manufacturing and distributing automobile accessories.&lt;ref name=BigDream31&gt;Banks, "Big Dream, Small Car," p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 he co-founded the American Automobile Accessory Company with Ira J. Cooper. The company's bestseller was a tire liner of Crosley's invention.&lt;ref name=NRHP-Pinecroft/&gt; Another popular product was a flag holder that held five American flags and clamped to auto radiator caps.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} By 1919 Crosley had 
sales of more than $1 million in parts. He also diversified into other consumer products such as [[phonograph]] cabinets, radios, and home appliances. Crosley's greatest strength was his ability to invent new products, while his brother, [[Lewis M. Crosley]], excelled in business.Lewis also became head of Crosley's manufacturing operations.&lt;ref name=GS79&gt;{{cite book | author=Linda C. Gugin and James E. St. Clair, eds. | title =Indiana's 200: The People Who Shaped the Hoosier State | publisher =Indiana Historical Society Press| year =2015 | location =Indianapolis | page=79  | url = | isbn =978-0-87195-387-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AutoHOF&gt;{{cite web| author= | title =Powel Crosley Jr.| work = | publisher =Automotive Hall of Fame  | date = | url = http://www.automotivehalloffame.org/honoree/powel-crosley-jr/ | format = | accessdate =May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, Crosley first selected independent local dealers as the best way to take his products to market. He insisted that all sellers of his products must give the consumer the best in parts, service, and satisfaction. Always sensitive to consumers, his products were often less expensive than other name brands, but were guaranteed. Crosley's "[[money back guarantee]]" set a precedent for some of today's most outstanding sales policies.

==Radio manufacturer==
[[File:Crosley radio.jpg|thumb|A Crosley radio from the late 1930s. Note that the "70" setting is marked "WLW," for the station owned by Crosley]]

For his contributions to early radio manufacturing, Crosley was once dubbed "The Henry Ford of Radio."&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; In 1921 Crosley's young son asked for a [[radio]], a new item at that time, but Crosley was surprised that toy radios cost more than $100 at a local department store. With the help of a booklet called "The ABC of Radio," he and his son decided to assemble the components and build their own [[crystal radio]] set. Crosley immediately recognized the appeal of an inexpensive radio and hired two University of Cincinnati students to help design a low-cost set that could be mass-produced. Crosley named the radio the "Harko" and introduced it to the market in 1921. The inexpensive radio set sold for $7, making it affordable to the masses. Soon, the Crosley Radio Corporation was manufacturing radio components for the rapidly growing industry and making its own line of radios.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite web| author=Young, Anthony | title = America's Forgotten Entrepreneur | work = | publisher = Foundation for Economic Education  | date = | url=http://www.fee.org/vnews.php?nid=355 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050513014111/http://www.fee.org/vnews.php?nid=355 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=May 13, 2005 | format = | accessdate =May 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Horstman&gt;{{cite news |author=Barry M.

By 1924 Crosley had moved his company to a larger plant and later made subsequent expansions. The [[Crosley Radio Corporation]] became the largest radio manufacturer in the world in 1925; its slogan, "You’re There With A Crosley," was used in all its advertising.&lt;ref name=GS79/&gt;&lt;ref name=Young/&gt;

In 1925 Crosley introduced another low-cost radio set. The small, one-tube, [[Regenerative circuit|regenerative]] radio was called the "[[Crosley Pup]]" and sold for $9.75.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} While [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] had [[Nipper]], its famous trademark showing a dog listening to "[[his master's voice]]" from a [[phonograph]], Crosley adopted a mascot in the form of a dog with [[headphone]]s listening to a Crosley Pup radio&lt;ref name=Bonzo&gt;A cute, pudgy little dog named [[Bonzo the dog|Bonzo]], the creation of British artist [[George E.

The headphone-wearing Bonzo was also associated with the Crosley Pup radios. See {{cite web| author=Richard Fitzpatrick| title =Bonzo and The Crosley Pup | work =George E.

[[File:Crosley Building, Cincinnati.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Crosley Building, Cincinnati]]
In 1928 Crosley's firm arranged for the construction of the Crosley Building at [[Camp Washington, Cincinnati|Camp Washington]], a Cincinnati neighborhood, and used the facility for its for radio manufacturing, radio broadcasting, and for manufacturing other devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Graham, Gordon |title=Historic Crosley Building Could Be Converted into Apartments|publisher=WXIX|date=2014-05-02|url=http://www.fox19.com/story/25415761/historic-crosley-building-to-be-converted-into-apartments|accessdate=2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 Crosley was marketing the "Roamio,"&lt;!--This is the correct spelling, don't change it!--&gt; with "screen grid neutrodyne power speaker"&lt;ref name=Mahon74&gt;{{cite book |author=Mahon, Morgan E. |title=A Flick of the Switch 1930–1950 |publisher=Antiques Electronics Supply | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1990| location = |page=74| url = | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; for automotive use. Priced at $75, before accessories and installation, it was claimed to be able to receive thirty stations with no signal strength change.&lt;ref name=Mahon74/&gt;

==Radio broadcasting==
{{Main|WLW}}{{Main|Crosley Broadcasting Corporation}}

Once Crosley established himself as a radio manufacturer, he decided to expand into broadcasting as a way to encourage consumers to purchase more radios. In 1921, soon after he built his first radios, Crosley began experimental broadcasts from his home with a 20-watt transmitter using the call sign 8CR.&lt;ref name=Horstman/&gt; On March 22, 1922, the [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]] received a commercial license to operate as [[WLW]] at 50 watts. Dorman D. Israel, a young radio engineer from the University of Cincinnati, designed and built the station's first two radio transmitters (at 100 and 1000 watts).&lt;ref name=Kiessewetter&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Kiesewetter |title=WLW 700 turns 80 | journal =[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]] | volume =  | issue = | pages = | publisher = | location =Cincinnati, Ohio | date =March 17, 2002 | url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/03/17/tem_wlw_700_turns_80.html| accessdate =May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1936 Israel became chief engineer and later executive vice president of [[Emerson Radio]].

In 1934 Crosley put a 500-kilowatt transmitter on the air, making WLW the station with the world's most powerful radio transmitter for the next five years.&lt;ref name=GS79/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kiessewetter/&gt; (On occasion, the station's power was boosted as high as 700,000 watts.){{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Throughout the 1930s, Cincinnati's WLW was considered "the Nation's Station," producing many hours of network programming each week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Litwinovich, Paul |title=NPR News and Classical Music: Powel Crosley Jr. and 'The Nation's Radio Station'|work=WSHU Public Radio |date=November 16, 2017|url=http://wshu.org/post/powel-crosley-jr-and-nations-radio-station| format = | accessdate =May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the entertainers who performed live from WLW's studios were [[Red Skelton]], [[Doris Day]], [[Jane Froman]], [[Fats Waller]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], and the [[Mills Brothers]].&lt;ref name=NRHP-Pinecroft/&gt; Crosley's station also developed some of the earliest radio "[[soap opera]]s" with [[Procter &amp; Gamble|Procter and Gamble]] as an initial sponsor.&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; In 1939 the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) ruled that WLW had to reduce its power to 50 kilowatts, partly because it interfered with the broadcasts of other stations, but largely due to its smaller competitors, who complained about the station's technical and commercial advantages with its 500-kilowatt broadcasts.&lt;ref name=NRHP-Pinecroft/&gt;

During [[World War II]], WLW resumed its powerful, 500-kilowatt transmissions in cooperation with the U.S. government.&lt;ref name=NRHP-Pinecroft/&gt; WLW's broadcasts from Ohio could be heard as far away as [[South America]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; The 500-kilowatt transmitter was crated for shipment to Asia, but the war ended before it was shipped.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} WLW's engineers also built high-power [[shortwave transmitter]]s on a site about {{convert|25|mile|km}} north of Cincinnati. Crosley Broadcasting, under contract to the U.S. government, began operating the [[Voice of America Bethany Relay Station|Bethany Relay Station]], which was dedicated on September 23, 1944, to broadcast "[[Voice of America]]" programming. The relay station's broadcasts continued until 1994.&lt;ref name=NRHP-Pinecroft/&gt;

Crosley's broadcasting company eventually expanded into additional markets. The company was experimenting with [[television]] broadcasting as early as 1929, when it received an experimental television license from the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), which later became the FCC. Crosley Broadcasting did not go on-air with regular television programming as [[WLWT-TV]] until after Crosley sold the company to Aviation Corporation ([[Avco]]) and he had become a member of Avco's board of directors..{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Appliance and consumer products manufacturer==
[[File:Icy ball front.JPG|thumb|Icy ball refrigerator]]
In the 1930s Crosley added refrigerators and other household appliances and consumer goods to his company's product line. Because he had invested in his own businesses instead of the stock market, Crosley was better able than many other industrialists to keep his employees working and his products available to the public during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=Young/&gt;

Crosley's "[[Icyball]]" was an early non-electrical refrigeration device. The unit used an evaporative cycle to create cold, and had no moving parts. The dumbbell shaped unit was "charged" by heating one end with a small kerosene heater. Crosley's company sold several hundred thousand Icyball units before discontinuing its manufacture in the late 1930s.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In 1932 Crosley had the idea of putting shelves in the doors of refrigerators. He patented the "Shelvador" refrigerator and launched the new appliance in 1933. At that time it was the only model with shelves in the door.&lt;ref name=BigDream32/&gt; In addition to refrigerators, Crosley's company sold other consumer products that included the "XERVAC," a device purported to "revitalize inactive [[hair]] cells" and "stimulate hair growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= | title =XERVAC | work = | publisher =TJS Labs Gallery of Graphic Design | date = | url =http://graphic-design.tjs-labs.com/gallery-view?product=XERVAC | format = |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosley also introduced the "Autogym," a motor-driven weight-loss device with a vibrating belt, and the "Go-Bi-Bi," a "rideable baby walker," among other products.&lt;ref name=GS80&gt;Gugin and St. Clair, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball team owner and sportsman==
In February 1934, Crosley purchased the [[Cincinnati Reds]] professional baseball team from [[Sidney Weil]], who had lost much of his wealth after the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Wall Street Crash of 1929]].&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; Crosley kept the team from going bankrupt and leaving Cincinnati. He was also owner of the Reds when the team won two [[National League]] titles (in 1939 and 1940) and the World Series in 1940.&lt;ref name=Horstman/&gt;&lt;ref name=LaHurd&gt;{{cite journal| author=LaHurd, Jeff | title =Powel Crosley Jr. remembered as a visionary  | journal = Herald-Tribune | volume = | issue = | page= B-1 | publisher = | location =Sarasota, Florida | date = November 15, 2015| url = http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20151115/article/151119774?p=1&amp;tc=pg&amp;tc=ar | accessdate =May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crosley was also a pioneer in broadcasting baseball games on the radio. On May 24, 1935, the first nighttime game in baseball history was held at Cincinnati's [[Crosley Field]], which was renamed in Crosley's honor after he acquired the team, between the Cincinnati Reds and [[Philadelphia Phillies]] under newly-installed electric lighting. With attendance at its evening games more than four times greater that its daytime events, the team's financial position was greatly improved.&lt;ref name=Young/&gt;&lt;ref name=AutoHOF/&gt; Crosley also approved baseball's first regularly-scheduled play-by-play broadcasts of all scheduled games on his local station, [[WKRC (AM)|WKRC]]. The coverage increased attendance so much that within five years all sixteen major league teams had radio broadcasts of every scheduled game.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

On a personal level, Crosley was an avid sportsman. Although he never had a pilot's license, Crosley owned several [[seaplane]]s, such as the [[Douglas Dolphin]], and [[airplane]]s, including building five Crosley "Moonbeam" airplanes. In addition, Crosley claimed that at one time he was slotted to be a driver in the [[Indianapolis 500]], but the claim that was not entirely accurate. He was entered but broke his arm working for Carl Fisher (see above).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Crosley was also the owner of [[luxury yacht]]s with powerful engines, and an active fisherman who participated in celebrated tournaments in Sarasota, Florida. He served as president of the Sarasota area's Anglers Club and was a founder of the American Wildlife Institute.&lt;ref name=LaHurd/&gt;&lt;ref name=GS80/&gt; Crosley owned several sports, hunting, and fishing camps: Nikassi, an island retreat in Ontario, Canada; Bull Island off the coast of South Carolina; a hunting retreat he called Sleepy Hollow Farm in Jennings County, Indiana, and a Caribbean vacation home at Cat Cays, Bahamas.&lt;ref name=NRHP-Pinecroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=BigDream33&gt;Banks, "Big Dream, Small Car," p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aircraft manufacturer ==
[[File:Crosley moonbeam.JPG|thumb|1929 Crosley "Moonbeam" at the Aviation Museum of Kentucky]]

The Crosley "Moonbeam" was built in [[Sharonville, Ohio]] and was first flown on December 8, 1929. It was designed by Harold D. Hoekstra, an employee of Crosley's when Crosley was president of the Crosley Aircraft Company. (Hoeskstra later became Chief of Engineering and Design for the [[Federal Aviation Administration]].) Unique features of this aircraft are the square tube longerons used in the fuselage construction, use of torque tubes instead of control cable, and the corrugated aluminum ailerons. Original power was supplied by a four-cylinder inverted inline 90&amp;nbsp;hp Crosley engine. At one time it was also tested with a 110 Warner Scarab engine. N147N reportedly was the first airplane on which the spoilers were tested (in May 1930) as a lateral control device. Five Moonbeams airplanes were produced. The first was a three-place parasol; next, a four-place, high wing cabin model; third and fourth were one place high wings. Due to the Great Depression, planned production did not take place. N147N is the last of these planes in existence. It is housed at the Aviation Museum of Kentucky in [[Lexington Kentucky]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[File:NASM - Mignet HM.14 Pou Du Ciel - La Cucaracha 1.jpg|thumb|Mignet Crosley "Flea," 1935]]

In 1933 Frenchman Henri Mignet designed the HM.14 "Pou du Ciel" ("Flying Flea"). He envisioned a simple aircraft that amateurs could build, and even teach themselves to fly. In an attempt to render the aircraft stall proof and safe for amateur pilots to fly, Mignet staggered the two main wings. The Mignet-Crosley "Pou du Ciel" is the first HM.14 made and flown in the United States. Edward Nirmaier, a Crosley employee, and two other men built the airplane in November 1935 for Crosley, who believed that the affordable "Flea" could become a popular aircraft in the United States. After several flights, a crash at the Miami Air Races in December 1935 finally grounded the Crosley HM.14. Although the airplane enjoyed a period of intense popularity in France and England, but a series of accidents in 1935-36 permanently ruined the airplane's reputation.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Automaker==
{{Main|Crosley}}
[[File:1939CrosleyTransferable.jpg|right|thumb|1939 Crosley "Transferable" model]]

Of all Crosley's dreams, success at building an affordable automobile for Americans was possibly the only major one eventually to elude him. In the years leading up to [[World War II]], Crosley developed new products that included reviving one of his earliest endeavors at automobile design and manufacturing. In 1939, when Crosley introduced the low-priced [[Crosley]] automobiles, he broke with tradition and sold his cars through independent appliance, hardware, and department stores instead of automobile dealerships.&lt;ref name=AutoHOF/&gt;&lt;ref name=BigDream34&gt;Banks, "Big Dream, Small Car," p. 34.

The first [[Crosley|Crosley Motors, Inc.]] automobile made its debut at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] on April 28, 1939, to mixed reviews.&lt;ref name=GS80/&gt; The [[compact car]] had an {{convert|80|in|cm|adj=on}} wheelbase and a {{convert|38.87|in3|cm3|adj=on}}, 
[[Multi-cylinder engine#Two-cylinder engines|two-cylinder]], air cooled [[Waukesha Engine|Waukesha engine]]. Crosley estimated that his cloth-top car, which weighed less than {{convert|1000|lb|kg}}, could get fifty miles per gallon at speeds of up to fifty miles per hour.&lt;ref name=LaHurd/&gt;&lt;ref name=BigDream33/&gt; The sedan model sold for $325, while the coupe sold for $350. Panel truck and pickup truck models were added to the product line in 1940.&lt;ref name=BigDream34/&gt; During the pre-war period, the company had manufacturing plants in [[Camp Washington, Ohio]]; [[Richmond, Indiana]]; and [[Marion, Indiana]]. When the onset of war ended all automobile production in the United States in 1942, Crosley had produced 5,757 cars.&lt;ref name=NRHP-Pinecroft/&gt;

[[Image:1949 Crosley Hotshot &amp; Appliance Display.jpg|thumb|1949 Crosley "Hotshot" sports model and appliance display at the Deer Park Museum, [[Escondido, California]]]]

After World War II ended, Crosley resumed building its small cars for civilian use. His company's first post-war automobile rolled off the assembly line on May 9, 1946.&lt;ref name=BigDream36-37&gt;Banks, "Big Dream, Small Car," pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The new Crosley "CC" model automobile continued the company's pre-war tradition of offering small, lightweight, and low-priced cars. It sold for $850 and got thirty to fifty miles per U.S. gallon. In 1949 Crosley became the first American carmaker to put [[disc brakes]] on all of its models.s&lt;ref name=BigDream28-29/&gt;

Unfortunately for Crosley, fuel economy ceased to be an inducement after gas rationing ended, and American consumers also began to prefer bigger cars.&lt;ref name=GS80/&gt; Crosley's best year was 1948, when it sold With 24,871 cars, but sales began to fall in 1949. Adding the Crosley "Hotshot" sports model and an all-purpose vehicle called the "Farm-O-Road" model in 1950 did not stop the decline. Only 1,522 Crosley vehicles were sold in 1952. Crosley sold about 84,000 cars before closing down the operation on July 3, 1952. The Crosley plant in Marion, Indiana, was sold to the [[General Tire|General Tire and Rubber Company]].&lt;ref name=BigDream36-37/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A plan to sell the Crosley auto concern to Nash failed to materialize, when Nash merged with Hudson. See Nash Club newsletter, 1986, volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==War-production contractor==
[[File:MK53_fuze.jpg|thumb|left|A Crosley-manufactured, Mark 53 proximity (VT) fuze for the U.S. Navy]]

Crosley's company was involved in war production planning before December 1941, and like the rest of American industry, it focused on manufacturing war-related products during World War II. The company made a variety of products,including [[proximity fuze]]s, experimental military vehicles, radio [[transceiver]]s, and [[gun turret]]s, among other items.&lt;ref name=BigDream34-35&gt;Banks, "Big Dream, Small Car," pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UAIWW2CA&gt;{{cite web| author=Jackson, David D. |title=The American Automobile Industry in World War Two | publisher =  | date =|url=http://usautoindustryworldwartwo.com/crosley.htm| accessdate =May 1, 2018}} See also: {{cite web| title = Radio Set BC-654-A SCR-284-A Receiver and Transmitter| url = http://www.radiomilitari.com/bc654.html| last = Fucci| first = Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proximity fuzes===
The most significant Crosley's wartime production was the [[proximity fuze]], which was manufactured by several companies for the military. Crosley's facilities produced more fuzes than any other manufacturer and made several production design innovations. The fuze is widely considered the third most important product development of the war years, ranking behind the [[atomic bomb]] and [[radar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= | coauthors = | title =Crosley the War Years |work = | publisher =Crosley Autoclub | date = | url =http://crosleyautoclub.com/War_Years.html | accessdate =May 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, Crosley himself did not have U.S. government security clearance and was not involved with the project. Without government security clearance, Crosley was prohibited from entering the area of his plant that manufactured the fuzes and did not know what top-secret products it produced until the war's end. Production was directed and supervised by Lewis M. Clement, the Crosley company's vice-president of engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=McClure, Rusty, Michael A.

[[James V. Forrestal]], [[United States Secretary of the Navy|U.S. Secretary of the Navy]] said: "The proximity fuze has helped blaze the trail to [[Japan]]. Without the protection this ingenious device has given the surface ships of the Fleet, our westward push could not have been so swift and the cost in men and ships would have been immeasurably greater."{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} [[George S. Patton]], Commanding General of the Third Army, remarked: "The funny fuze won the [[Battle of the Bulge]] for us. I think that when all armies get this shell we will have to devise some new method of warfare."{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Radio tranceivers, gun turrets, and other products===
Also of significance were the many radio transceivers that Crosley's company manufactured during the war, including 150,000 [[BC-654]]s, a receiver and transmitter that was the main component of the SCR-284 radio set. The Crosley Corporation also made components for [[Walkie-talkie]] transceivers and [[Instrument flight rules|IFR]] radio guidance equipment, among other products. In addition, Crosley's also manufactured field kitchens, air supply units for Sperry S-1 [[Gyroscopic autopilot|bombsites]] (used in [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 bombers]]), air conditioning units, [[Martin PBM Mariner]] bow-[[gun turret]]s, and quarter-ton trailers. Gun turrets for [[PT boat]]s and B-24 and [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29 bombers]] were the company's largest military contract.&lt;ref name=UAIWW2CA/&gt;

===Experimental military vehicles===
During the war, Crosley's auto manufacturing division, CRAD (for Crosley Radio Auto Division), in Richmond, Indiana, produced experimental [[motorcycles]], [[Motorized tricycle|tricycles]], four-wheel-drive vehicles, and [[continuous track]] vehicles, including some [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious]] models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Strohl, Daniel| title=Amphibious vehicles: surrender to Cincinnati – Crosley rolls out the war machine| work = | publisher=Hemmings Daily| date =March 9, 2017 |url=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2007/03/09/surrender-to-cincinnati-crosley-rolls-out-the-war-machine/| format = | accessdate =May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these military prototypes were powered by the two-cylinder boxer engine that had powered the original Crosley automobile.&lt;ref name=eWillysPup&gt;{{cite web| author= |title=More on the Crosley "Pup" Jeep |publisher=eWilly | date =January 1, 2014 |url=http://www.ewillys.com/2014/01/01/more-on-the-crosley-pup-jeep/ | format = | accessdate =May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crosley had nearly 5,000 of these engines on hand when civilian automobile production ceased in 1942, and hoped to put them to use in his miniature war machines.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

One vehicle [[prototype]] was the 1942/1943 Crosley CT-3 "Pup," a lightweight, single-passenger, four-wheel-drive vehicle that was transportable and air-droppable from a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|C-47 Skytrain]]. Six of the {{convert|1125|lb|kg|adj=on}} Pups were deployed overseas after undergoing tests at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], but the Pup project was discontinued due to several weak components. Seven of the thirty-seven Pups that were built are known to survive.&lt;ref name=UAIWW2CA/&gt;&lt;ref name=eWillysPup/&gt;

==Later years==
Although Crosley retained ownership of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team and Crosley Motors, he sold his other business interests, including WLW radio and the Crosley Corporation, to the Aviation Corporation (Avco) in 1945.&lt;ref name=BigDream34-35/&gt; Crosley remained on the Avco board for several years afterward. Avco put Ohio's second television station, [[WLWT-TV]], on the air in 1948, the same year it began manufacturing television sets. Avco manufactured some of the first portable television sets under the Crosley brand name. Crosley ceased to exist as a brand in 1956, when Avco closed the unprofitable product line; however, the Crosley name was so well established that Avo's broadcasting division, owener of WLWT-TV, retained the Crosley name until 1968, seven years after Crosley's death.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Crosley sold Pimlico Plantation, now demolished, in 1942, and Seagate, his winter retreat in Florida in 1947. In 1954 Crosley sold his vacation home at Cat Keys, Bahamas. In 1956 he sold Sleepy Hollow Farm in Jennings County, Indiana, to the state of Indiana for use as a [[Nature reserve|wildlife preserve]]. Bull Island, South Carolina, became part of a national [[wildlife refuge]]. It is not known when Crosley sold his vacation retreat in Ontario, Canada.&lt;ref name=NRHP-Pinecroft/&gt;&lt;ref name=BigDream36-37/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Crosley died on March 28, 1961, of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 74.&lt;ref name=BigDream34-35/&gt; He is buried at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio.&lt;ref name=PCgrave/&gt;

Crosley liked to label himself "the man with 50 jobs in 50 years," a catchy [[sobriquet]] that was far from true, although he did have more than a dozen jobs before he got into automobile accessories. Crosley helped quite a few inventors up the ladder of success by buying the rights to their inventions and sharing in the profits. His work provided employment and products for millions of people.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Part of Crosley's Pinecroft estate, his former Cincinnati, Ohio, home, is the site of Mercy Hospitals West; however, the Franciscan Sisters of the Poor have used his mansion as a retreat since the early 1970s. Seagate, Crosley's former winter retreat on Sarasota Bay in Florida, is operated as an event rental facility.

WLW radio continues to operate as an AM station. Crosley's manufacturing plants in Richmond and Marion, Indiana, are still standing, but they no longer produce automobiles.&lt;ref name=BigDream37/&gt; In 1973 a group of Avco executives purchased the Evendale, Ohio, operation of AVCO Electronics Division, a successor to one of Crosley's business ventures, and renamed it the Cincinnati Electronics Corporation. The company manufactured a broad range of sophisticated electronic equipment for communications and space, infrared and radar, and electronic warfare, among others. Since its creation in 1973, Cincinnati Electronics has been acquired by a handful of companies, including GEC Marconi (1981), BAE Systems (1999), CMC Electronics (2001), and L-3 Communications (2004–present).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The present-day Crosley Corporation is not connected to Crosley. An independent appliance distributor formed the current company after purchasin the rights to the name from [[Avco]] in 1976.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1379">'''Project MKOFTEN''' was a covert [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] program developed in conjunction with the [[CIA]]. A partner program to [[MKSEARCH]], the goal of MKOFTEN was to "test the behavioral and toxicological effects of certain drugs on animals and humans".&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110430024832/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/02-A-0846RELEASE.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author [[Gordon Thomas (author)|Gordon Thomas]]'s 2007 book ''Secrets and Lies'' the CIA's Operation Often was also initiated by the chief of the CIA's Technical Services Branch, [[Dr. Sidney Gottlieb]], to "explore the world of black magic" and "harness the forces of darkness and challenge the concept that the inner reaches of the mind are beyond reach". As part of Operation Often, Dr. Gottlieb and other CIA employees visited with and recruited fortune-tellers, palm-readers, clairvoyants, astrologists, mediums, psychics, specialists in demonology, witches and warlocks, Satanists, other occult practitioners, and more.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, pp. 295-299&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13939">In computer programming, a '''self-relocating''' program is a program that relocates its own address-dependent instructions and data when run, and is therefore capable of being loaded into memory at any address.&lt;ref name="Dhamdhere_1999"/&gt; In many cases, self-relocating code is also a form of [[self-modifying code]].

==Overview==
Self-relocation is similar to the [[relocation (computer science)|relocation]] process employed by the [[linker (computing)|linker]]-[[loader (computing)|loader]] when a program is copied from external storage into main memory; the difference is that it is the loaded program itself rather than the loader in the [[operating system]] or [[shell (computing)|shell]] that performs the relocation.

One form of self-relocation occurs when a program copies the code of its instructions from one sequence of locations to another sequence of locations within the main memory of a single computer, and then transfers processor control from the instructions found at the source locations of memory to the instructions found at the destination locations of memory. As such, the data operated upon by the algorithm of the program is the sequence of bytes which define the program.

Self-relocation typically happens at [[load-time]] (after the operating system has loaded the software and passed control to it, but still before its initialization has finished), sometimes also when changing the program's configuration at a later stage during [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime]].&lt;ref name="Paul_1997_FreeKEYB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul_2006_FreeKEYB"/&gt;

==Examples==
==={{anchor|Bootloader}}Boot loaders===
As an example, self-relocation is often employed in the early stages of bootstrapping operating systems on architectures like [[IBM PC compatible]]s, where lower-level chain [[boot loader]]s (like the [[Master Boot Record]] (MBR), [[Volume Boot Record]] (VBR) and initial boot stages of operating systems such as [[DOS]]) move themselves out of place in order to load the next stage into memory.

==={{anchor|DOS}}x86 DOS drivers===
Under [[DOS]], self-relocation is sometimes also used by more advanced [[device driver|driver]]s and [[Resident system extension|RSX]]s/[[Terminate and stay resident program|TSR]]s loading themselves "high" into [[upper memory]] more effectively than possible for externally provided "high"-loaders (like [[LOADHIGH]]/[[HILOAD]], [[INSTALLHIGH]]/[[HIINSTALL]] or [[DEVICEHIGH]]/[[HIDEVICE]] etc.&lt;ref name="Caldera_1998_DRDOS702"/&gt; since DOS 5) in order to maximize the memory available for applications. This is down to the fact that the operating system has no knowledge of the inner workings of a driver to be loaded and thus has to load it into a free memory area large enough to hold the whole driver as a block including its initialization code, even if that would be freed after the initialization. For TSRs, the operating system also has to allocate a [[Program Segment Prefix]] (PSP) and an [[environment segment]]. This might cause the driver not to be loaded into the most suitable free memory area or even prevent it from being loaded high at all. In contrast to this, a self-relocating driver can be loaded anywhere (including into [[conventional memory]]) and then relocate only its (typically much smaller) resident portion into a suitable free memory area in upper memory. In addition, advanced self-relocating TSRs (even if already loaded into upper memory by the operating system) can relocate over most of their own PSP segment and command line buffer and free their environment segment in order to further reduce the resulting memory footprint and avoid [[memory fragmentation|fragmentation]]. Some self-relocating TSRs can also dynamically change their "nature" and morph into device drivers even if originally loaded as TSRs, thereby typically also freeing some memory.&lt;ref name="Paul_2006_FreeKEYB"/&gt; Finally, it is technically impossible for an external loader to relocate drivers into [[expanded memory]] (EMS), the [[high memory area]] (HMA) or [[extended memory]] (via [[DOS Protected Mode Services|DPMS]] or [[CLOAKING (DOS extender) |CLOAKING]]), because these methods require small driver-specific [[DOS memory stub|stub]]s to remain in conventional or upper memory in order to coordinate the access to the relocation target area,&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_Drivers"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_Exception_EMSUMB"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_Exception_HMA"/&gt; and in the case of device drivers also because the driver's header must always remain in the first megabyte.&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_Drivers"/&gt; In order to achieve this, the drivers must be specially designed to support self-relocation into these areas.&lt;ref name="Paul_2002_Drivers"/&gt;

=== IBM DOS/360 programs ===
[[IBM]] [[DOS/360]]&lt;!-- 1966 --&gt; did not have the ability to relocate programs during loading. Sometimes multiple versions of a program were maintained, each built for a different load address. A special class of programs, called self-relocating programs, were coded to relocate themselves after loading. IBM [[OS/360]]&lt;!-- 1966 --&gt; relocated executable programs when they were loaded into memory. Only one copy of the program was required, but once loaded the program could not be moved (so called [[one-time position-independent code]]).

===Other examples===
As an extreme example of (many-time) self-relocation it is possible to construct a computer program so that it does not stay at a fixed address in memory, even as it executes. The [[Apple Worm]]&lt;ref name="Dewdney_1985"/&gt; is a dynamic self-relocator.

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group="nb"|refs=
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_Exception_EMSUMB"&gt;An exception to the requirement for a stub is when [[expanded memory]] is converted into [[permanent upper memory]] by the memory manager via [[EMSUMB]], and thus it is effectively accessed as [[upper memory]], not via [[Expanded Memory Specification|EMS]].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_Exception_HMA"&gt;There are two exceptions to the stub requirement for a driver to load into the HMA: A stub is not necessary when [[high memory (DOS)|high memory]] is permanently enabled on machines without [[gate A20]] logic, however, as this condition isn't met in general, generic DOS drivers cannot take advantage of it (unless they would explicitly test on this condition beforehand). Otherwise, a stub is also not necessary under [[DR DOS 6.0]] and higher, when resident system extensions (like SHARE and NLSFUNC) only hook the multiplex interrupt INT 2Fh, because they can then utilize a backdoor interface to hook into the interrupt chain in [[kernel space]] so that the kernel's gate A20 handler will provide the functionality of the stub. Still, the driver has to perform self-relocation in order to function correctly in the HMA.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:shell tube flow.png|thumb|right|260px|Fluid flow [[Computational fluid dynamics|simulation]] for a shell and tube style exchanger; The shell inlet is at the top rear and outlet in the foreground at the bottom]]
A '''shell and tube heat exchanger''' is a class of [[heat exchanger]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sadik Kakaç  |author2=Hongtan Liu |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Heat Exchangers: Selection, Rating and Thermal Design|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=0-8493-0902-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Perry, Robert H.  |author2=Green, Don W. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=6th| publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=0-07-049479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most common type of heat exchanger in oil refineries and other large chemical processes, and is suited for higher-pressure applications.  As its name implies, this type of heat exchanger consists of a shell (a large [[pressure vessel]]) with a bundle of tubes inside it.  One fluid runs through the tubes, and another fluid flows over the tubes (through the shell) to transfer heat between the two fluids. The set of tubes is called a tube bundle, and may be composed of several types of tubes: plain, longitudinally finned, etc.
==Theory and application==
Two fluids, of different starting temperatures, flow through the heat exchanger.  One flows through the tubes (the tube side) and the other flows outside the tubes but inside the shell (the shell side).  Heat is transferred from one fluid to the other through the tube walls, either from tube side to shell side or vice versa.  The fluids can be either [[liquid]]s or [[gas]]es on either the shell or the tube side.  In order to transfer heat efficiently, a large [[heat transfer]] area should be used, leading to the use of many tubes.  In this way, [[waste heat]] can be put to use.  This is an efficient way to conserve energy.

Heat exchangers with only one [[phase (matter)|phase]] (liquid or gas) on each side can be called one-phase or single-phase heat exchangers.  Two-phase heat exchangers can be used to heat a liquid to boil it into a gas (vapor), sometimes called [[boiler]]s, or cool a vapor to condense it into a liquid (called [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]s), with the phase change usually occurring on the shell side.  Boilers in steam engine [[locomotive]]s are typically large, usually cylindrically-shaped shell-and-tube heat exchangers.  In large [[power plant]]s with steam-driven [[turbine]]s, shell-and-tube [[surface condenser]]s are used to condense the exhaust [[steam]] exiting the turbine into condensate [[water]] which is recycled back to be turned into steam in the steam generator.

==Shell and tube heat exchanger design==

There can be many variations on the shell and tube design.  Typically, the ends of each tube are connected to '''plenums''' (sometimes called '''water boxes''') through holes in '''tubesheets'''.  The tubes may be straight or bent in the shape of a U, called U-tubes.  
&lt;center&gt;[[File:U-tube heat exchanger.PNG]]&lt;/center&gt;  
In nuclear power plants called [[pressurized water reactor]]s, large heat exchangers called [[Steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generators]] are two-phase, shell-and-tube heat exchangers which typically have U-tubes. They are used to boil water recycled from a surface condenser into steam to drive a [[Steam turbine|turbine]] to produce power. Most shell-and-tube heat exchangers are either 1, 2, or 4 pass designs on the tube side.  This refers to the number of times the fluid in the tubes passes through the fluid in the shell.  In a single pass heat exchanger, the fluid goes in one end of each tube and out the other.    
&lt;center&gt;[[File:Straight-tube heat exchanger 1-pass.PNG]]&lt;/center&gt;  
Surface condensers in power plants are often 1-pass straight-tube heat exchangers (see [[surface condenser]] for diagram). Two and four pass designs are common because the fluid can enter and exit on the same side.  This makes construction much simpler.  
&lt;center&gt;[[File:Straight-tube heat exchanger 2-pass.PNG]]&lt;/center&gt;
There are often [[Baffle (heat exchanger)|baffles]] directing flow through the shell side so the fluid does not take a short cut through the shell side leaving ineffective low flow volumes. These are generally attached to the tube bundle rather than the shell in order that the bundle is still removable for maintenance.

Counter current heat exchangers are most efficient because they allow the highest [[log mean temperature difference]] between the hot and cold streams.  Many companies however do not use two pass heat exchangers with a u-tube because they can  break easily in addition to being more expensive to build.  Often multiple heat exchangers can be used to simulate the counter current flow of a single large exchanger.

===Selection of tube material===
To be able to transfer heat well, the tube material should have good [[thermal conductivity]].  Because heat is transferred from a hot to a cold side through the tubes, there is a [[temperature]] difference through the width of the tubes.  Because of the tendency of the tube material to thermally expand differently at various temperatures, [[thermal stress]]es occur during operation.  This is in addition to any [[Stress (physics)|stress]] from high [[pressure]]s from the fluids themselves.  The tube material also should be compatible with both the shell and tube side fluids for long periods under the operating conditions ([[Operating temperature|temperatures]], pressures, [[pH]], etc.) to minimize deterioration such as [[corrosion]].  All of these requirements call for careful selection of strong, thermally-conductive, corrosion-resistant, high quality tube materials, typically [[metal]]s, including [[aluminium]], [[copper alloy]], [[stainless steel]], [[carbon steel]], [[non-ferrous]] copper alloy, [[Inconel]], [[nickel]], [[Hastelloy]] and [[titanium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Shell and Tube Exchangers | url=http://www.southwestthermal.com/shell-tube-exchanger.html | accessdate=2009-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fluoropolymers]] such as [[Perfluoroalkoxy alkane]] (PFA) and [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene]] (FEP) are also used to produce the tubing material due to their high resistance to extreme temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PFA Properties|url=http://www.fluorotherm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PFA-Properties.pdf|website=http://www.fluorotherm.com/|publisher=Fluorotherm Polymers, Inc.|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor choice of tube material could result in a [[leak]] through a tube between the shell and tube sides causing fluid cross-contamination and possibly loss of pressure.

===Applications and uses===

The simple design of a shell and tube heat exchanger makes it an ideal cooling solution for a wide variety of applications. One of the most common applications is the cooling of [[hydraulic fluid]] and oil in engines, transmissions and [[hydraulic power pack]]s. With the right choice of materials they can also be used to cool or heat other mediums, such as swimming pool water or charge air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Applications and Uses| url=http://www.thermex.co.uk/products/shell-and-tube-heat-exchangers | accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the big advantages of using a shell and tube heat exchanger is that they are often easy to service, particularly with models where a floating tube bundle (where the tube plates are not welded to the outer shell) is available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usbellows.com/technical/heat_exchanger.htm Heat Exchanger Shell Bellows] Piping Technology and Products, (retrieved March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shift by wire''' is the system by which the transmission modes are engaged/changed in an automobile through electronic controls without any mechanical linkage between the gear shifting lever and the transmission. The transmission shifting was traditionally accomplished by mechanical links to put the vehicle in [[Automatic transmission#Automatic transmission modes|Park, Reverse, Neutral and Drive positions]] through a lever mounted on the steering column or a gear shifter near the center console.

This eliminates routing space required for housing the mechanical linkages between the shifter and the transmission and provides effortless shifting through the press of a button or through knobs. Elimination of this linkage removes any shift effort from the driver’s gear selection.

In order to make a spintronic device, the primary requirement is to have a system that can generate a current of spin-polarized [[electrons]], as well as a system that is sensitive to the spin polarization.  Most spintronic devices also have a unit in between these two that changes the current of electrons depending on the spin states. Candidates for such devices include injection schemes based on [[magnetic semiconductors]] and [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] [[metal]]s, [[ferromagnetic resonance]] devices&lt;ref name=Tserkovnyak&gt;

[[Image:Vanpool.jpg|thumb|A King County Vanpool]]

'''Vanpools''' are an element of the transit system that allow groups of people to share the ride similar to a [[carpool]], but on a larger scale with concurrent savings in fuel and vehicle operating costs.  Vanpools have a lower operating and capital cost than most transit vehicles in the United States, but due to their relatively low capacity, vanpools often require subsidies comparable to conventional bus service. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntdprogram.gov/ntdprogram/pubs/profiles/2012/Transit%20Profiles%202012%20Report%20Year%20Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Vehicles may be provided by individuals, individuals in cooperation with various public and private support programs, through a program operated by or on behalf of an element of government, or a program operated by or on behalf of an employer.

The key concept is that people share the ride from home or one or more common meeting locations and travel together to a common destination or work center.  

A number of programs exist (within the United States) to help lower the cost of that shared ride to the end user.  Among these are traditional funding available to public agencies, public-private partnerships, and the Best Work Places for Commuters&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwc.gov/&lt;/ref&gt; (Commuter Choice Programs). A tax benefit is available under [http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t26t28+151+2++%28%29%20%20AND%20%28%2826%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20AND%20%28USC%20w%2F10%20%28132%29%29%3ACITE%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%2026 26 U.S.C. §132(f)] Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefit allowances. These public transportation programs seek to reduce the number of cars on the road (with all the attendant environmental benefits). 

Additional benefits include:
* Speed: The van can use the [[HOV]] (High Occupancy Vehicle) lanes because normally more than 2-3 people ride.
* Fixed schedule (makes life more predictable).
* Saving the cost of [[gasoline]] (in some cases, it is part of the program).
* Riders often can have significant reductions in the cost of personal [[Vehicle insurance|automobile insurance]] (insurance for the rideshare component is usually provided as part of the vanpool program).
* Incentives from local/federal transportation authorities offset cost.

In many cases, an employer may elect to subsidize the cost of the vanpool and the vehicles' maintenance.  In some cases, the vehicles are provided and maintained by the municipality; in others in partnership with or by a third-party provider. For example, [[UCLA]] operates an extensive network of vans, in which faculty, staff and students are eligible for discounted rates, although anyone commuting to the Westwood area is allowed to participate, with drivers receiving the highest discounts. The vans are centrally maintained, fueled, and cleaned.

The King County Metro Vanpool Program&lt;ref&gt;http://metro.kingcounty.gov/tops/van-car/commutervans.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a successful [[demand responsive transport]] program in the [[Puget Sound]] area, specifically in [[King County, Washington]]. Another successful program is operated by [[Pace (transit)|Pace]] in [[Illinois]].

The oldest multi-employer vanpool program in the country is in Treasure Valley, Idaho. For over 30 years Ada County Highway District’s Commuteride&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commuteride.com|title=Ada County Highway District ~ Commuteride|work=commuteride.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanpools have been crisscrossing the Valley helping commuters go to and from work, with their numerous vanpool routes traveling throughout the Treasure Valley. The Vanpools also service the Military at Gowen Field and Mountain Home Air Force Base (MHAFB) with multiple routes to and from Ada and Canyon County. ACHD Commuteride serves the cities, Boise, Meridian, Kuna, Garden City, Eagle and Star as well as Ada County.

Private firms operate vanpools for individuals, as well as in cooperation with employers or under contract.

The '''Whirlwind wheelchair''' is a [[wheelchair]] designed to be made in [[developing countries]] using local resources, in a [[sustainable development]] effort.

It was co-designed by [[Ralf Hotchkiss]] of Whirlwind Wheelchair International. Hotchkiss, a paraplegic, has traveled extensively, designing wheelchairs that could be built in developing countries.

Whirlwind Wheelchair International uses the principle of [[open source design]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = OPEN SOURCE DESIGN | url = http://www.whirlwindwheelchair.org/open.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers construction classes and consulting services.

[[File:Long cane.jpg|thumb|upright|A long cane, the primary mobility tool for the visually impaired]]

A '''white cane''' is used by many people who are [[blindness|blind]] or [[visually impaired]]. Primarily it aids its user to scan their surroundings for obstacles or orientation marks, but is also helpful for other traffic participants in identifying the user as blind or visually impaired and taking appropriate care. The latter is the reason for the cane's prominent white colour, which in many jurisdictions is mandatory.

*'''Long Cane''': This "traditional" white cane, also known as a "Hoover" cane, after Dr. Richard Hoover, is designed primarily as a mobility tool used to detect objects in the path of a user. Cane length depends upon the height of a user, and traditionally extends from the floor to the user's [[human sternum|sternum]]. Some organisations favor the use of much longer canes.&lt;ref name=Nichols1995 &gt;{{Citation | author = Nichols, Allan | year = 1995  | title = Why Use the Long White Cane? | url = http://www.blind.net/g42w0001.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100330050804/http://www.blind.net/g42w0001.htm | archivedate = 2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Guide Cane''': This is a shorter cane, generally extending from the floor to the user's waist, with a more limited mobility function. It is used to scan for kerbs&lt;!--do not change! This is British English!--&gt; and steps. The guide cane can also be used diagonally across the body for protection, warning the user of obstacles immediately ahead.
*'''Identification Cane ''' (or '''Symbol Cane''' in British English): The ID cane is used primarily to alert others as to the bearer's visual impairment. It is often lighter and shorter than the long cane, and has no use as a mobility tool.
*'''Support Cane''': The white support cane is designed primarily to offer physical stability to a visually impaired user. By virtue of its colour, the cane also works as a means of identification. This tool has very limited potential as a mobility device.
*'''Kiddie Cane''': This version works the same as an adult's Long Cane but is designed for use by children.
*'''Green Cane''': Used in some countries to designate that the user has low vision while the white cane designates that a user is blind.&lt;ref name="Ley del Bastón Verde" /&gt;

Mobility canes are often made from [[aluminium]], [[graphite-reinforced plastic]] or other [[fibre-reinforced plastic]], and can come with a wide variety of tips depending upon user preference.

White canes can be either collapsible or straight, with both versions having pros and cons. The [[National Federation of the Blind]] in the United States affirms that the lightness and greater length of the straight canes allows greater mobility and safety, though collapsible canes can be stored with more ease, giving them advantage in crowded areas such as classrooms and public events.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eWn8kwKAwF4C&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=%22white+cane%22+%22advantage%22+%22public%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwy53J-oPZAhWLBsAKHcLxBtQQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22white%20cane%22%20%22advantage%22%20%22public%22&amp;f=false ''Code of Federal Regulations: 1985-1999'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Education of the Visually Handicapped: The Official Publication of Association for Education of the Visually Handicapped, Volumes 1-3'' {{ISBN|0-7246-3988-8}} p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Blind people have used canes as mobility tools for centuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orientationandmobility.org/profession.html|title=Historical Development of Orientation and Mobility as a Profession|first=Pat|last=Kelley|publisher=OrientationAndMobility.org|year=1999|accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until after [[World War I]] that the white cane was introduced.

In 1921 James Biggs, a photographer from [[Bristol]] who became blind after an accident and was uncomfortable with the amount of traffic around his home, painted his walking stick white to be more easily visible.&lt;ref&gt;'Mobility of Visually Impaired People: Fundamentals and ICT Assistive Technologies'' {{ISBN|978-3-319-54444-1}} p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 in France, [[Guilly d'Herbemont]] launched a national white stick movement for blind people. On February 7, 1931, Guilly d'Herbemont symbolically gave the first two white canes to blind people, in the presence of several French ministers. 5,000 more white canes were later sent to blind French veterans from World War I and blind civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Bailly, Claude | year = 1990  | title = Les débuts de la canne blanche | journal = l'Auxilaire des aveugles| url = http://dherbemont.free.fr/en/textes/cannes.html|language=French|accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the introduction of the white cane is attributed to George A. Bonham of the [[Lions Clubs International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/content/vision_services_whitecane.shtml White Cane Day&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021027155024/http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/content/vision_services_whitecane.shtml |date=October 27, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, a Lions Club member watched as a man who was blind attempted to cross the street with a black cane that was barely visible to motorists against the dark pavement. The Lions decided to paint the cane white to make it more visible. In 1931, Lions Clubs International began a program promoting the use of white canes for people who are blind.

The first special white cane ordinance was passed in December 1930 in [[Peoria, Illinois]] granting blind pedestrians protections and the right-of-way while carrying a white cane. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acb.org/tennessee/white_cane_history.html|title=White Cane History|publisher=American Council of the Blind|access-date=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long cane was improved upon by [[World War II]] veterans [[Rehabilitation counseling|rehabilitation]] specialist, Richard E. Hoover, at [[Valley Forge]] Army Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afb.org/unseen/book.asp?ch=Koe-33omchron|title=Historical Chronologies , The Unseen Minority: A Social History of Blindness in the United States|publisher=[[American Printing House for the Blind]]|first=Frances A|last=Koestler|accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1944, he took the Lions Club white cane (originally made of wood) and went around the hospital blindfolded for a week. During this time he developed what is now the standard method of "long cane" training or the Hoover Method.  He is now called the "Father of the Lightweight Long Cane Technique."  The basic technique is to swing the cane from the center of the body back and forth before the feet.  The cane should be swept before the rear foot as the person steps.  Before he taught other rehabilitators, or "orientors," his new technique he had a special commission to have light weight, long white canes made for the veterans of the European fronts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Weiner, W.R., Welsh, R.L., &amp; Blasch, B.

On October 6, 1964, a joint resolution of the Congress, HR 753, was signed into law authorizing the President of the United States to proclaim October 15 of each year as "[[White Cane Safety Day]]". President [[Lyndon Johnson]] was the first to make this proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://nfb.org/white-cane-safety-day "White Cane Safety Day]", National Federation of the Blind.

==Legislation about canes==
[[File:Support cane folded.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A folding support cane]]

While the white cane is commonly accepted as a "symbol of blindness", different countries still have different rules concerning what constitutes a "cane for the blind".

In the United Kingdom, the white cane indicates that the individual has a visual impairment; with two red bands added it indicates that the user is [[deafblind]].

In the United States, laws vary from state to state, but in all cases, those carrying white canes are afforded the [[right-of-way (traffic)|right-of-way]] when crossing a road.  They are afforded the right to use their cane in any public place as well. In some cases, it is illegal for a non-blind person to use a white cane with the intent of being given right-of-way.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfb-nagdu.org/laws/usa/usa.html{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031010015519/http://www.nfb-nagdu.org/laws/usa/usa.html |date=October 10, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://acb.org/whitecane&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2002, Argentina passed a law recognizing the use of green canes by people with low vision, stating that the nation would "Adopt from this law, the use of a green cane in the whole of Argentina as a means of orientation and mobility for people with low vision. It will have the same characteristics in weight, length, elastic grip and fluorescent ring as do white canes used by the blind."&lt;ref name="Ley del Bastón Verde"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rollano|first1=Eduardo D.|last2=Oyarzún|first2=Juan C.|title=Personas con Baja Visión|url=http://www.infoleg.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/80000-84999/80888/norma.htm|website=Información Legislativa y Documental|publisher=The Government of Argentina|accessdate=31 March 2015|location=Argentina|language=Spanish|date=27 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, people carrying a white cane are excepted from the ''{{ill|Vertrauensgrundsatz|de}}'' (trust principle), therefore meaning that other traffic participants should not rely on them to adhere to all traffic regulations and practices. Although there is no general duty to mark oneself as blind or otherwise disabled, a blind or visually impaired person involved in a traffic accident without having marked themselves may be held responsible for damages unless they prove that their lack of marking was not causal or otherwise related to the accident.

== Children and canes ==
In many countries, including the UK, a cane is not generally introduced to a child until they are between 7 and 10 years old.  However, more recently canes have been started to be introduced as soon as a child learns to walk to aid development with great success.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldaccessfortheblind.org/sites/default/files/Facilitating_Movement.pdf{{page needed|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commonsense.me.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Cutter]] and [[Lilli Nielsen]], pioneers in research on the development of blind and multiple-handicapped children, have begun to introduce new research on mobility in blind infants in children.  Cutter's book, ''Independent Movement and Travel in Blind Children'',&lt;ref name=Cutter2007 &gt;{{Citation | author = Cutter, Joseph | year = 2007  | title = Independent Movement and Travel in Blind Children | ISBN= 1-59311-603-9}}{{page needed|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommends a cane to be introduced as early as possible, so that the blind child learns to use it and move around naturally and organically, the same way a sighted child learns to walk.  A longer cane, between nose and chin height, is recommended to compensate for a child's more immature grasp and tendency to hold the handle of the cane by the side instead of out in front.  Mature cane technique should not be expected from a child, and style and technique can be refined as the child gets older.
