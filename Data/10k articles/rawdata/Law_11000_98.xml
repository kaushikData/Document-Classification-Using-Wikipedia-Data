The '''2012 Romanian constitutional crisis''' was a major political and constitutional conflict between [[President of Romania|President]] [[Traian Băsescu]] and [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Victor Ponta]] of [[Romania]]. A dispute arose between the two regarding the representation of Romania to the [[European Council]] reunion of June 28, 2012. The dispute degenerated in [[civil disobedience]] and conflicting views between political parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/07/us-romania-politics-idUSBRE86609I20120707 "Germany, U.S: Romania power struggle hurts democracy"], ''Reuters''&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 December 2012, Băsescu and Ponta signed an agreement on institutional cohabitation, effectively ending the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rnews.ro/2013/05/07/1-an-de-guvernare-usl-acordul-de-coabitare-ponta-basescu/ | title=1 an de guvernare USL: acordul de coabitare Ponta – Băsescu | publisher=R/NEWS | date=2013-05-07 | accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{see also|2012 Romanian protests}}
President [[Traian Băsescu]] and Prime Minister [[Victor Ponta]] became locked in a constitutional judicial conflict over Romania's representation at the June 28, 2012 meeting of the European Council. President Traian Băsescu submitted a complaint to Romania's Constitutional Court in point of the conflict with Government concerning the representation on the European Council. Ponta declared to the Romanian press agency Mediafax that misconception claimed by President Băsescu to the Constitutional Court is between Presidency and Parliament, and Court judges can only determine the existence of a conflict, that can not be solved only by amending the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bzi.ro/ccr-decide-astazi-cine-va-merge-la-consiliul-european-297560 "CCR decides today who will go to the European Council"], ''Bună Ziua Iași''&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliament plenary adopted on June 12, 2012, with 249 votes in favor, 30 against and two abstentions, a political declaration recommending that at European Council meeting on June 28 Romania to be represented by Premier Victor Ponta, not by President Traian Băsescu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenda.ro/news/news/56427/parlamentul-il-trimite-pe-victor-ponta-la-consiliul-european-%7C-video.html "Parliament sends Victor Ponta to the European Council"], ''Agenda''&lt;/ref&gt; That decision triggered a fierce conflict between the two Palaces. {{As of |2012}}, President Traian Băsescu sent to Premier Victor Ponta a letter which drew attention that participation in the European Council without a mandate from the President legally equalizes with ownership of a constitutional prerogatives of the President. At a press conference, Ponta broke the letter, ironically replying this gesture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvrinfo.ro/conflictul-dintre-ponta-si-basescu--transat-la-ccr--premiera--premierul-va-fi-prezent-la-sedinta_17904.html "Prime Minister Victor Ponta officially announces its departure to Brussels. Presidency without reaction"], ''TVRinfo.ro''&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, Constitutional Court decides that the President is required to attend the European Council in [[Brussels]]. Ponta respond in a way that nobody expected. Government takes in authority the Official Monitor, delaying publication of the Constitutional Court decision, regarding participation in European Council and making the presence of Victor Ponta in Brussels to be legal.

===Plagiarism controversy===
[[File:My name is Paste. Copy Paste, proteste Victoria 9-7-12.JPG|thumb|left|Protest in [[Victory Square, Bucharest]] against Ponta Cabinet]]
[[Victor Ponta]] obtained his PhD in law from the [[University of Bucharest]], in July 2003, with a thesis entitled "International Criminal Court". Scientific advisor of this piece of work was [[Adrian Năstase]], then Prime Minister in office, who serves a 1-year sentence in prison since 2012.

On June 18, 2012, online edition of '' Nature'' magazine published the news that Victor Ponta, "Prime Minister of Romania, has been accused of copying large sections of his 2003 PhD thesis in law from previous publications, without proper reference".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/romanian-prime-minister-accused-of-plagiarism-1.10845 "Romanian prime minister accused of plagiarism"], ''Nature.com''&lt;/ref&gt; The charge was made on the basis of documents compiled by an anonymous [[whistleblower]]. "Ponta obtained his doctorate from the University of Bucharest while he was Secretary of State in [[Năstase I Cabinet]], who was his doctoral thesis supervisor", the author writes.

Concomitantly, imputation of plagiarism was also published by German newspaper [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/abgeschrieben-plagiatsvorwurf-gegen-rumaeniens-ministerpraesident-11790951.html "Plagiatsvorwurf gegen Rumäniens Ministerpräsident"], ''Faz.net''&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Peter Schwarz, a journalist from the newspaper and author of the inquiry published by him, commented on the subject in an interview on June 20, 2012, in which showed that the case would be worse than plagiarists politicians in [[Germany]] and [[Hungary]], whereas the latter "didn't copy whole pages of the thesis, as he did".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-12575002-interviu-karl-peter-schwarz-autorul-anchetei-din-ziarul-german-frankfurter-allgemeine-zeitung-cazul-ponta-mai-grav-decat-cazurile-schmitt-guttemberg-pentru-nu-copiat-pagini-intregi-ale-tezei-asa-cum-f.htm "Karl Peter Schwarz, author of the inquiry of German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: Ponta case is worse than Schmitt and Guttemberg cases «because they didn't copy entire pages of the thesis, as he did»"], ''HotNews.ro''&lt;/ref&gt; News from ''Nature'', about plagiarism, were resumed by Romanian and international press, in [[România Liberă]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/plagiat-ponta-autorii-articolului-din-nature-pentru-rl-nu-avem-niciun-dubiu-asupra-credibilitatii-surselor-noastre-267891.html "Ponta's plagiarism.

A document published by [[Romanian Television|TVR]] presents the passages of thesis copied in parallel with source texts. It appears that much of the work was copied, word for word, from the following works:&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.tvrinfo.ro/other/201206/oglinda-vp-2003-teza_94614100.pdf Comparison: PhD thesis and source texts], ''TVRinfo.ro''&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the National Council for the Recognition of Degrees, Diplomas and Certificates decided, after examining the thesis of PM Ponta, that he had plagiarized 85 pages of the work,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romania-actualitati.ro/victor_ponta_a_plagiat_85_de_pagini_din_lucrarea_de_doctorat-42355 "Victor Ponta «plagiarized 85 pages» of doctoral thesis"], ''Radio România Actualități''&lt;/ref&gt; although in the press had conveyed numbers from 30&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revista22.ro/doctorul-ponta-si-plagiatul-15788.html "Dr. Ponta and plagiarism"], ''Revista 22''&lt;/ref&gt; to about 130 pages plagiarized from these works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziare.com/victor-ponta/plagiat/plagiatul-lui-victor-ponta-vezi-documentele-care-sustin-acuzatiile-1173905 "Victor Ponta's plagiarism - see documents supporting allegations"], ''Ziare.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed analysis in parallel of the texts conducted by journalists from ''România Liberă'' indicated not only a taking over of the informative parts, but also of the authors' personal assessments, of the rhetorical questions put by them, of the references to older texts of the same author, and orthography mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/plagiat-ponta-premierul-a-preluat-inclusiv-greseli-gramaticale-si-aprecieri-personale-268005.html "Ponta's plagiarism. The prime minister took inclusive grammatical mistakes and personal assessments"], ''România Liberă''&lt;/ref&gt; The doctoral thesis was subsequently published in book form, with a preface signed by even I. Diaconu (author of one of the three plagiarized works), having Daniela Coman as co-author. Other sources indicate author's preface as Adrian Năstase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/plagiat-ponta-patru-profesori-de-drept-desfiinteaza-apararea-premierului-268016.html "Ponta's plagiarism. Four law professors dissolved PM defense"], ''România Liberă''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, National Ethics Council decided on July 18, 2012 that Ponta didn't plagiarize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/cine-l-a-spalat-pe-ponta-de-plagiat-printre-membrii-cne-un-fost-deputat-psd-992787.html "Who cleaned Ponta of plagiarism.

On July 20, 2012, Ethics Committee of the University of Bucharest decided that Victor Ponta deliberately plagiarized, finding passages copied on 115 pages of the 297 (namely the thesis excluding Năstase's preface and appendices).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/Universitatea_Bucuresti_prezinta_azi_verdictul_comisiei_sale_in_cazul_doctoratului_lui_Ponta_0_740326049.html "University of Bucharest: Victor Ponta plagiarized and deliberately plagiarized. Number of pages with copy-paste rose to 115"], ''Adevărul.ro''&lt;/ref&gt; In the same day, ''Nature'' magazine related about contradictory verdicts of Government Ethics Commission and Ethics Committee of the University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/conflicting-verdicts-on-romanian-prime-minister-s-plagiarism-1.11047 "Conflicting verdicts on Romanian prime minister's plagiarism"], ''Nature.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/educatie/plagiat-ponta-vezi-pozitia-revistei-nature-in-legatura-cu-verdictul-comisiilor-care-l-au-anchetat-pe-premier-271178.html "Ponta's plagiarism.

===''Diesel fuel'' dossier ===
[[File:Elena Udrea bgiu.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Elena Udrea]] was intercepted four times in the dossier.]]
President Traian Băsescu and former [[Ministry of Regional Development and Tourism (Romania)|Minister of Regional Development and Tourism]], [[Elena Udrea]], were intercepted in the dossier of former head of National Agency for Fiscal Administration, Sorin Blejnar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agentia.org/teoria-conspiratiei/dosarul-motorina-discu-ii-ale-lui-traian-b-sescu-i-elenei-udrea-cu-sorin-blejnat-interceptate-de-procurori-37665.html "The Dossier «Diesel fuel». Discussion of Traian Băsescu and Elena Udrea with Sorin Blejnar, intercepted by prosecutors"], ''Agenția de Investigații Media''&lt;/ref&gt; President Băsescu spoke on the phone with Blejnar about [[Rompetrol]] problem, but also about the situation of a company that has contracts with the State. Elena Udrea also had four discussions with Blejnar, in that they fixed appointments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtv.net/traian-basescu-interceptat-in-dosarul-lui-sorin-blejnar_49643.html "Traian Băsescu and Elena Udrea, intercepted in Sorin Blejnar's Dossier «Diesel fuel»"], ''România TV''&lt;/ref&gt;

The phone of former head of the IRS was heard by prosecutors in the case of [[diesel fuel]] imports in [[Brașov]], in that the former head of NAFA was indicted by DIICOT prosecutors for favoring the offender.

Sorin Blejnar called in September 2010 the President Traian Băsescu, to inform him about a construction company, which has won numerous contracts with the State and which has debts. The company belongs to some PDL friends. Likewise, President demanded explanations about Rompetrol and told Blejnar to find solutions together with the [[Ministry of Justice (Romania)|Minister of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/traian-basescu-interceptat-in-dosarul-lui-sorin-blejnar-10246531 "Transcript of a discussion Blejnar-Băsescu. Presidency: Discussions focused Rompetrol debts. Collecting debts is subject to CSAT"], ''Mediafax.ro''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Presidential Administration recognized the interceptions in DIICOT dossier. According to the Presidency, talks between President Băsescu and former head of NAFA focused on the recovery of Rompetrol company's debts to the State, given that combating tax evasion and collection of receivables from the state budget made the object of a CSAT decision of 28 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghimpele.ro/2012/10/cum-explica-traian-basescu-interceptarile-telefonice-in-dosarul-lui-sorin-blejnar/ "Băsescu's statements on the DIICOT interceptions in Sorin Blejnar's dossier"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416172521/http://www.ghimpele.ro/2012/10/cum-explica-traian-basescu-interceptarile-telefonice-in-dosarul-lui-sorin-blejnar/ |date=2013-04-16 }}, ''Ghimpele.ro''&lt;/ref&gt;

The judicial inspection of the Superior Council of Magistracy initiated an investigation to see if the DIICOT case prosecutor in the Dossier "Diesel fuel" complied with the procedure when introduced interceptions with President Traian Băsescu in the dossier devoid of classifying them and to investigate a possible leak from Brașov Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realitatea.net/csm-s-a-sesizat-in-cazul-stenogramelor-blejnar-cum-a-ajuns-basescu-in-ele_1034670.html "CSM seized for transcripts of Blejnar dossier.

=== Corruption scandal ===
In a report on justice in Romania, drawn up by the [[European Commission]] on January 30, 2013, appear three ministers investigated for corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/eveniment/comisia-europeana-doi-ministri-cercetati-pentru-fapte-de-coruptie-nu-trei-vezi-cine-a-scapat-292118.html "European Commission: Two ministers investigated for corruption, not three. See who escaped"], ''România Liberă''&lt;/ref&gt; According to a European official, two of ministers referred to in the CVM report are [[Liviu Dragnea]] and [[Varujan Vosganian]]. According to Prime Minister [[Victor Ponta]], the third one is [[Relu Fenechiu]]. Dragnea is being investigated for alleged involvement in fraud in the referendum regarding the dismissal of President [[Traian Băsescu]]. Fenechiu was prosecuted, in the summer of 2012, in Transformer dossier, in which he's charged with complicity in abuse of office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antena3.ro/politica/crin-antonescu-raportul-mcv-determina-prejudicii-romaniei-201609.html "Crin Antonescu: The CVM report causes prejudices to Romania"], ''Antena3.ro''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-14125420-comisia-europeana-facut-modificare-raportul-justitie-doi-loc-trei-ministri-cercetati-penal-pentru-fapte-coruptie.htm "The European Commission has made a change in the Justice report: Two instead of three ministers under investigation for corruption offenses"], ''HotNews.ro''&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the European Commission Report on the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism records that there's intimidation and harassment against individuals in state institutions, like National Integrity Agency, Constitutional Court, High Court of Cassation and Superior Council of Magistracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/justitie/document-comisia-europeana-critica-romania-in-raportul-mcv-nu-exista-independenta-in-justitie-291887.html "Document.

==Beginning of crisis ==
{{double image|right|Wiki ponta.jpg|146|Traian Băsescu, at the International Conference in Support of the new Libya (cropped).jpg|127|[[Victor Ponta]] (left) and [[Traian Băsescu]] (right)}}
Traian Băsescu's troubles began on June 18. [[Hidroelectrica]], a state-owned energy company announced that it was [[bankrupt|insolvent]]. It was a move that Ponta hit the "smart guys", which have signed contracts with all governments (right- or left-wing) to buy cheap energy from Hidroelectrica. On the same day, Victor Ponta became embroiled in a plagiarism scandal: ''Nature'' magazine claimed that the Premier copied his dissertation in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.ziuanews.ro/dezvaluiri-investigatii/atac-si-contraatac-17001 "Traian Băsescu and Victor Ponta are among the most hard fight for power in recent years"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416112230/http://m.ziuanews.ro/dezvaluiri-investigatii/atac-si-contraatac-17001 |date=2013-04-16 }}, ''Ziua News''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtv.net/reuters-acuzatiile-de-plagiat-la-adresa-lui-ponta-alimenteaza-instabilitatea-in-romania_34369.html "Reuters: Allegations of plagiarism against Ponta fed instability in Romania"], ''România TV''&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, former PSD leader and premier and Ponta's political mentor [[Adrian Năstase]] was sentenced to two years of imprisonment after conviction in a corruption trial due to his alleged involvement in the dossier "Quality Trophy". The same evening, as police arrived at his home to escort him to prison, Năstase shot himself in an apparent suicide attempt and was transported to Floreasca Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/politica/Politia_a_venit_dupa_Adrian_Nastase_0_722328150.html# "Adrian Năstase shot himself in the neck. Ponta was at hospital"], ''Adevărul.ro''&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, Adrian Năstase was transferred to Rahova Prison Hospital.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ponta si basescu 55083900.jpg|thumb|200px|War between Ponta and Băsescu was severely criticized in the international press]] --&gt;
On June 25, the [[Romanian Senate]] decided to alter the functioning of the Constitutional Court law, such that the court will not be able to rule on Parliament decisions, thus facilitating the procedure for suspension of the President. In the following days, the [[Chamber of Deputies]] approved the referendum law amendment, which established that the President can be dismissed easily, only half the votes of those who come to the polls. Until that point, the law stipulated that the President is dismissed only if the proposal was passed by majority of voters registered on electoral lists. On June 27, the Pure uninominal law, initiated by Victor Ponta and [[Crin Antonescu]], is declared unconstitutional. In the same day, PDL attack to the Constitutional Court the referendum law and the Constitutional Court Law amending.

In press occurs rumors about filing a penal complaint at Parquet against Victor Ponta by Traian Băsescu, as the Prime Minister to be, then suspended from office. President denies this version, but accuses Ponta that represents illegitimate Romania in Brussels. National Council for Titles, Diplomas and Certificates establishes that Victor Ponta plagiarized in his PhD thesis. Council claims that 85 pages are copied and called for the title of doctor withdrawal. But, before the verdict, Interim Minister of Education, Liviu Pop, dissolved the National Council for Titles, Diplomas and Certificates, such that the decision was void.

On July 3, the [[Romanian Parliament]], at proposal of majority represented by [[Social Liberal Union|USL]], vote dismissal of [[President of the Senate of Romania|President of the Senate]], PDL leader [[Vasile Blaga]], [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania|President of the Chamber of Deputies]], PDL member [[Roberta Anastase]] and [[Ombudsman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capital.ro/detalii-articole/stiri/usl-cere-revocarea-din-functie-a-robertei-anastase-si-a-lui-vasile-blaga-168644.html "USL requires dismissal of Roberta Anastase and Vasile Blaga"], ''Capital''&lt;/ref&gt; Through an Emergency Ordinance, government restricts the attributions of the [[Constitutional Court of Romania|Constitutional Court]], restoring them to the 2010 status quo.

==President's suspension==
Băsescu was suspended as [[President of Romania]], by [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], with 256 votes in favor and 114 against. There were two abstentions. After announcing the results, Parliament proposed that the presidential impeachment [[Romanian presidential impeachment referendum, 2012|referendum]] to be held on July 29, 2012, proposal approved by the plenary with 242 votes in favor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gandul.info/politica/traian-basescu-a-fost-suspendat-vreau-sa-cred-ca-romanii-nu-si-doresc-linistea-din-vremea-lui-iliescu-marele-argument-al-suspendacilor-este-ca-nu-am-popularitate-9820801 "Traian Băsescu was suspended"], ''Gândul.info''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/06/world/europe/romania-impeachment/index.html "Romanian president suspended"], ''CNN''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.com/2012/07/06/romania-parliament-votes-to-suspend-president-basescu/ "Romania parliament votes to suspend President Băsescu"], ''Euronews''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130422062253/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/360425/20120706/romania-parliament-votes-to-suspend-president.htm "Romania parliament votes to suspend president"], ''International Business Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Suspended president notified the Constitutional Court, calling for a constitutional legal conflict between president and Parliament. "I do not defend the seat, but I want to defend the office", President explained. Therewith, he reiterated accusations against [[Social Liberal Union|USL]] and its leaders, accusing them of lying and wanted to subordinate the justice. "If I return as president it will still be impossible for thieves and impostors from politics to negotiate with me their calmness. I think that Romanians do not want the peace during Iliescu government. I can not guarantee that I will continue to be a strong nut for those who believe that Romania can go forward with a justice that protects thieves", [[Băsescu]] said.

He added that "suspender's great argument is that I haven't popularity", and if he will be reappointed at referendum and he will find Victor Ponta in office he will never entrust the prime minister function.

On the other hand, [[Social Liberal Union|USL]] leaders [[Crin Antonescu]] and [[Victor Ponta]] ensured that there will be no pressure for justice and for other state institutions.

[[Victor Ponta]] said that during this period of political crisis his family received threats, having to resort to state institutions for protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediafax.ro/english/romanian-president-suspended-by-parliament-referendum-on-july-29-9824770 "Romanian President suspended By Parliament, referendum on July 29"], ''Mediafax.ro''&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, the [[Constitutional Court of Romania|Constitutional Court]] ascertained [[President of Romania|President]] [[Băsescu]]'s suspension and confirmed [[Crin Antonescu]] as [[President of Romania|Interim President]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtv.net/ccr-a-validat-suspendarea-lui-basescu-crin-antonescu-este-presedinte-interimar_35418.html "CCR validated Băsescu's suspension. Crin Antonescu is interim president"], ''România TV''&lt;/ref&gt; Therewith, [[Constitutional Court of Romania|Constitutional Court]] rejected complaints formulated by [[Vasile Blaga]] and [[Roberta Anastase]], supported by [[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|PDL]], regarding removal from office of [[President of the Senate of Romania|President of the Senate]], respectively [[President of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania|President of the Chamber of Deputies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtv.net/ccr-revocarile-lui-vasile-blaga-si-a-robertei-anastase-constitutionale_35447.html "CCR: Vasile Blaga and Roberta Anastase revocations, constitutional"], ''România TV''&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 19, [[Social Liberal Union|USL]] laid down, at the Office of the [[High Court of Cassation and Justice]], a penal complaint against suspended [[President of Romania|President]] [[Traian Băsescu]] and other 14 people, for "spreading false information, for defamation of the country and the nation and for endangering safety of the national economy and currency stability".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realitatea.net/usl-a-depus-plangere-penala-impotriva-lui-oltean--basescu-si-alti-13-pedelisti--vezi-ce-spune-oltean_971299.html "USL laid down penal complaint against Oprea, Băsescu and other 13 people"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060538/http://www.realitatea.net/usl-a-depus-plangere-penala-impotriva-lui-oltean--basescu-si-alti-13-pedelisti--vezi-ce-spune-oltean_971299.html |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''Realitatea.net''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motives invoked for suspension ===
# The President usurped the role of prime minister and substituted him in the constitutional attributions of the Government.
# The President repeatedly violated fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens provided in the Constitution.
# The President repeatedly violated the principle of separation of powers and judicial independence.
# The President has initiated an unconstitutional project to revise the Constitution and violated the constitutional review procedure provided by the fundamental law.
# The President abetted to breach of the Constitutional Court decisions and made direct pressure on the judges of the Court, making them "visits" before important decisions.
# The President systematically violated the principle of political non-possession of the person who serves as presidential function and abandoned his constitutional role of mediator in the state and society.
# The President seriously violated the Constitution and the fundamental principle of representative democracy, when he said he would not appoint a Prime Minister of the USL, even if this party will get absolute majority in Parliament.

Initially, in press was rumored that the referendum wasn't validated due to presence under 50% at vote. Central Electoral Bureau announced on August 1, 2012 the final results of the referendum regarding president Traian Băsescu's dismissal. According to BEC data, 46.24% of citizens entitled to vote attended the referendum. For Băsescu's dismissal voted 87.52%, and against 11.15%. 1.32% was the percentage of invalid votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gandul.info/news/referendum-2012-rezultate-finale-bec-prezenta-la-vot-46-24-pentru-demiterea-lui-basescu-au-votat-87-52-iar-impotriva-11-15-9913998 "2012 referendum.

Constitutional Court decided on August 21 that 29 July Romanian presidential impeachment referendum is invalid, and Traian Băsescu will return at the Cotroceni Palace. According to official sources, the decision was taken by 6 votes to 3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediafax.ro/social/cc-referendumul-pentru-demiterea-presedintelui-e-invalid-basescu-revine-la-cotroceni-9966327 "CCR: Romanian presidential impeachment referendum is invalid.

"Despite all normative acts in effect, recommendations of the Venice Commission, actual updated figures, the nine judges of the Constitutional Court of Romania ignore the political choice of the Romanians. In present-day Romania, the volition of 9 political appointees is above the volition of a nation", was said in a FACIAS communique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziare.com/politica/referendum/decizia-ccr-de-invalidare-a-referendumului-reclamata-la-cedo-1185578 "CCR decision on the referendum, reported at ECHR"], ''Ziare.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Foundation representatives say in CCR decisions material is not respected the principle of the double degree of jurisdiction, in that CCR decisions can not be appealed to any internal tribunal.

=== Controversies ===
On July 24, the President of PDL decided to urge voters to not vote at July 29's Romanian presidential impeachment referendum. The decision was made by 59 votes in favor and one abstention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/pdl-boicoteaza-referendumul-alegatorii-sa-nu-participe-la-vot-pe-29-iulie-9899083 "PDL boycotts the referendum: Voters should not vote on July 29"], ''Mediafax.ro''&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that this action is illegal and the party led by Vasile Blaga should be acted criminally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corectnews.com/politics/intern/ponta-boicotarea-referendumului-e-ilegala-voi-trimite-o-scrisoare-partenerilor-nostr "Ponta: Boycott is illegal.

After casting a ballot in the referendum, Prime Minister Victor Ponta expressed "outrage" over what he called his Hungarian counterpart [[Viktor Orbán]]'s intervention in the country’s internal politics by telling ethnic Hungarians in Romania to stay away from the polls in a recall referendum. A count of voters from around 5pm showed turnout was lowest in the Harghita and Covasna counties, at 6.85% and 12.39%, respectively. Likewise, [[Attila Mesterházy]], [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] leader, warned that Orbán's statements in Romania will affect the minority of ethnic Hungarians, "both short-term and long-term", considering that Hungarian Prime Minister gesture is an interference in the internal affairs of Romania. In both counties, ethnic Hungarians constitute the majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-politic-12921624-declaratiile-lui-orban-romania-vor-afecta-etnicii-maghiari-avertizeaza-socialistii-ungari.htm "Viktor Orbán's statements in Romania will affect the Hungarians, Hungarian socialists warn"], ''HotNews.ro''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-politic-12904413-referendum-pentru-demiterea-presedintelui-traian-basescu-sectiile-votare-deschid-ora-07-00.htm "Victor Ponta: I am very shocked that Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, urges Romanian citizens of Hungarian ethnicity to not come to vote"], ''HotNews.ro''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politics.hu/20120730/romanian-pm-claims-outrage-over-hungarian-counterparts-comments-on-impeachment-referendum/ "Romanian PM claims «outrage» over Hungarian counterpart's comments on impeachment referendum"], ''Politics.hu''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship|European Commissioner for Justice]], [[Viviane Reding]], said that after the referendum for President Traian Băsescu's dismissal, there were new pressures and attempts to influence the outcome. Reding said the referendum could not end the political crisis and pressures on judges have continued even after finding out the results, to influence them. She said "the situation in Romania remains fragile", expressing the hope that all political actors in the country are determined to bear "durable and irreversible" the rule of law and judicial independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziare.com/politica/referendum/reding-dupa-referendum-au-existat-noi-incercari-de-influentare-a-rezultatului-1189735 "Reding: Situation remains fragile in Romania, to respect the rule of law"], ''Ziare.com''&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Reding's statements, the President of the group of the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]], [[Hannes Swoboda]], said, on September 12, in the European Parliament plenary, that, by reactions to the situation in recent months in Romania, has been impugned the objectivity of EC. "Why not responded with months before to the facts of Mr. Băsescu?", S&amp;D leader in PE asked. Hannes Swoboda also showed that 7.4 million Romanians expressed in the referendum against President Băsescu, much more than elected him. He accused PDL MEPs, including [[Monica Macovei]], of propaganda with falsehoods against USL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtv.net/swoboda-atac-la-reding-ati-pus-sub-semnul-intrebarii-obiectivitatea-comisiei-europene_44167.html "Swoboda, attack on Reding: You impugned the objectivity of the European Commission"], ''România TV''&lt;/ref&gt;

"Where, if not here in PE, you must tell why vote of 8.4 million citizens did not matter at all to you this summer, why a rule that isn't valid anywhere in Europe was imposed to Romania and here I refer to the 50% to vote", said PSD MEP [[Cătălin Ivan]], in his speech in EP plenary, at the debate on the political situation in Romania. Addressing to Reding, Ivan claimed that she has "acted as canvasser" of Traian Băsescu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtv.net/catalin-ivan-catre-reding-in-pe-v-ati-comportat-ca-un-agent-electoral-al-lui-basescu_44164.html "Cătălin Ivan, to Reding, in EP: You have acted as Băsescu's canvasser"], ''România TV''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==
[[File:Discurs Băsescu 3, protest Piaţa Revoluţiei 26-7-12.jpg|thumb|left|Traian Băsescu, the impeached Romanian President, speaking at a meeting in his support.]]
The political turmoil fractured Romanian society. Currently, the Romanian people are divided into two camps: anti-Băsescu and pro-Băsescu.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Despite high temperatures, driven from behind by their parties or on their own, in several areas of the country, people began to leave the streets to defend their favorites or to protest their opponents. Thus, relatively peaceful protests have erupted in major cities of Romania. In [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], protests turned violent when Băsescu's opponents and sympathizers clashed. The groups were quickly dispersed by police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cronicaromana.ro/2012/07/05/politicienii-au-bagat-vrajba-intre-romani/ "Politicians have put enmity between Romanians"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416140713/http://cronicaromana.ro/2012/07/05/politicienii-au-bagat-vrajba-intre-romani/ |date=2013-04-16 }}, ''Cronica Română''&lt;/ref&gt; None of the groups participating in action on Thursday evening has no authorization, can not specifying how protests will last.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gandul.info/news/conflict-intre-participantii-la-mitinguri-contra-si-pro-basescu-la-arad-9820367 "Conflict between participants in rallies against and pro-Basescu, in Arad"], ''Gândul.info''&lt;/ref&gt;

Street protests were also organized in [[Bucharest]]. About one hundred people protested on July 4 at University Square against the political class. Those present displayed messages against exploitation in [[Roșia Montană]] and shale gas. At Victory Square, occurred a new demonstration against the current leadership, and came, as one day ago, former Prime Minister [[Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu]]. He argued that it is normal that people to leave in the streets, criticizing USL leader Ponta and Antonescu, which he said that "have succeeded to demonstrate how it can be trampled the Constitution". Ungureanu has transmitted to demonstrators that "he awaits them Thursday", in Revolution Square, where the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Romania)|Liberal Democratic Party]] announced the organization of an anti-USL meeting.

In the following days, protests were amplified, such that more than 2,000 people gathered at the meeting on Thursday evening, in University Square, in a demonstration in support of President Traian Băsescu, attended by prominent members of the PDL. From Thursday's protests were not without any incidents. Attending the pro-Băsescu meeting, Raluca Turcan went faint to the end of the meeting and another five people needed medical care after they felt sick to rally in Revolution Square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtv.net/proteste-pro-si-contra-basescu-in-bucuresti-lupta-politica-s-a-mutat-in-strada-video_35132.html "Pro- and anti-Băsescu protests in Bucharest: Political struggle moved into the street"], ''România TV''&lt;/ref&gt; Some demonstrators in University Square were fought, Thursday evening, and were separated by gendarmes in device on-site, that raised two people from among recalcitrants.

Some protesters were fought"], ''Știrile PRO TV''&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Timișoara]], the two groups of protesters were nearly to confront. PDL sympathizers and supporters of the President gathered Thursday evening in the center of Timișoara to denounce what they call abusive measures taken by Ponta government in last days. Spirits were heated when in the area has appeared a group of supporters of USL, shouting slogans against the President. The dispute between the two groups, initially only verbal, risked to degenerate, so gendarmes immediately intervened to appease spirits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/actualitate/proteste-au-avut-loc-si-in-tara-jandarmii-au-intervenit-la-timisoara-pentru-a-linisti-spiritele.html "Protests took place in the country.

More than 200 people gathered on August 21 to protest in front of the Constitutional Court. They asked judges to validate the 29 July referendum, as suspended president Traian Băsescu to be dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a1.ro/news/social/zeci-de-oameni-protesteaza-in-fata-curtii-constitutionale.html "Dozens of people protested «at the window» of Constitutional Court"], ''A1.ro''&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in a petition on the Internet, approximately 2,000 people demanded that the meeting where CCR will decide the fate of the referendum to be broadcast live by television. Protesters chanted "Validation!" and have stirred flags and banners with different messages. People said they have not been complied with voting options and they didn't trust even the decisions of the Constitutional Court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/eveniment/Peste_200_de_persoane_protesteaza_la_sediul_Curtii_Constitutionale_0_759524154.html "Over 200 people protested at the Constitutional Court"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824000403/http://www.adevarul.ro/actualitate/eveniment/Peste_200_de_persoane_protesteaza_la_sediul_Curtii_Constitutionale_0_759524154.html |date=2012-08-24 }}, ''Adevărul.ro''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Constitutional Court invalidated the referendum for dismissal of Traian Băsescu, more people, dissatisfied with the verdict, went to the presidential campaign center, where they chanted against him, one of the protesters being detained by gendarmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.b1.ro/stiri/eveniment/incident-in-fata-sediului-de-campanie-al-lui-traian-basescu-un-protestatar-scandalagiu-luat-pe-sus-de-jandarmi-35731.html "Incident at the President Traian Băsescu's campaign center: A rowdy protester, took up by gendarmes"], ''B1.ro''&lt;/ref&gt; On the way to University Square, protesters also stopped in front of the Supreme Court Parquetry, where several minutes chanting "Thieves".

In the evening, over 2,000 people protested in front of the National Theatre. Protesters shouted messages against CCR decision of invalidation of the referendum and asked Traian Băsescu to resign. Also, most people have come up with anti-US placards with messages, considering that Băsescu was reinstalled at Americans desire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziare.com/stiri/proteste/proteste-pro-si-contra-basescu-in-pietele-din-bucuresti-dupa-decizia-ccr-1185549 "Anti-US and anti-Băsescu protests at the University.

Spirits were engirt and, at around 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., people breached fences and entered on the carriageway, blocking traffic. The gendarmes did not intervene, only forming a cordon to be prepared if people resort to violence. Traffic was diverted and only around midnight was resumed in the Square area, when protesters began to withdraw to their homes. Nevertheless, dozens of people continued to protest after midnight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antena3.ro/romania/protestul-anti-basescu-din-piata-universitatii-s-a-incheiat-fara-incidente-majore-180925.html "Anti-Băsescu protest in University Square ended without major incidents"], ''Antena3.ro''&lt;/ref&gt;

Gendarmes identified 106 people who blocked traffic on 21 and 22 August in University Square.

Politically, infighting in the summer of 2012 had deteriorated the image of Romania in the face of European leaders. After the EU officials perceived the [[First Ponta cabinet|Ponta Government]] acts as abuses against the [[rechtsstaat|legal state]], [[Romania]] risks to remain at the gates of the [[Schengen Area]], but mainly to run out European funds. After Tuesday, July 3, President of [[European People's Party]] [[Wilfried Martens]] warned that [[Social Liberal Union]] has started a plan to undermine the state, and Wednesday German [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]s leader [[Markus Ferber]] said he would initiate the suspension of Romania in the European Council for "lack of minimum standards functioning the legal state", stake increased substantially when [[Alain Lamassoure]] and [[Elmar Brok]] asked the European Commission to prepare a report leading to suspension of voting rights of Romania in the European Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanialibera.ro/actualitate/europa/blocarea-fondurilor-europene-arma-ue-impotriva-lui-ponta-269716.html "Blocking the European funds, EU weapon against Ponta"], ''România Liberă''&lt;/ref&gt;

Crin Antonescu, USL Co-President, said he disagrees with Victor Ponta's position to consider well-balanced the EC attitude as against Romania, but he understands these statements as attempts to reduce Brussels' hostility. "I'm disappointed in Barroso's lack of shade to take account of what Romanians expressed by vote. It was not a well-balanced attitude. It was an obvious and assumed political bias.

{{property law}}
{{Confusing|date=July 2010}}

'''Accession''' has different definitions depending upon its application.

In [[property law]], it is a mode of acquiring [[property]] that involves the addition of value to property through labor or the addition of new materials. For example, a person who owns a property on a river delta also takes ownership of any additional land that builds up along the riverbank due to natural deposits or man made deposits.

In [[commercial law]], accession includes goods that are physically united with other goods in such a manner that the identity of the original goods is not lost.&lt;ref&gt;American Law Institute, U.C.C. Article 9, § 102(a)(2) (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[English common law]], the added value belonged to the original property's owner. For example, if the buyer of a car has parts added or replaced, then the buyer fails to make scheduled payments and the car is repossessed, the buyer has no right to the new parts because they have become a part of the whole car.

In modern [[common law]], if the property owner allows the accession through [[bad faith]], the adder of value is entitled to damages or title to the property. If the individual who adds value to the owner's [[Personal property|chattel]] (personal property) is a trespasser or does so in bad faith, the owner retains title and the trespasser cannot recover labor or materials. The owner of the chattel may seek conversion damages for the value of the original materials plus any consequential damages. Alternatively, the owner may seek [[replevin]] (return of the chattel). However, the owner may be limited to damages if the property has changed its nature by accession. For example, if a finder discovers a gemstone and in good faith believes it to be abandoned and then cuts it and integrates it into a work of art, the true owner may be limited to recovery of damages for the value of the gemstone, but not of the final art piece by way of replevin. The remedies and application of the law vary by legal [[jurisdiction]].

== Roman accession ==

'''Accession''' might also be (from Latin ''accedere'', to go to, approach), in [[law]], a method of acquiring [[property]] adopted from [[Roman law]] (see: ''[[accessio]]''), by which, in things that have a close connection with or dependence on one another, the property of the principal draws after it the property of the accessory, according to the principle, ''accessio cedet principali''.&lt;ref name=Chisholm&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Accession|volume=1|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accession may take place either in a natural way, such as the growth of [[fruit]] or the pregnancy of animals, or in an artificial way. The various methods may be classified as:
* Land to land by accretion or [[alluvion]]
* Moveables to land or [[Fixture (property law)|fixture]]s
* Moveables to moveables
* Moveables added to by the art or industry of man&lt;ref name=Chisholm/&gt;

===Accession in relation to land===
The general principle was that everything acceded to the land, since the land was the principal.

====Buildings (''inaedificatio'')====
Ownership of the house was considered distinct from ownership of the materials used to make the house. Owners of the materials were permitted to vindicate the materials upon demolition of the house, but the demolition of the house was forbidden by the Twelve Tables.

Where X built on X's land using Y's materials, X owned the house since it acceded to X's land. Y would be capable of laying ''one'' of two actions if X was in good faith (bonas fides) in using Y's materials, but ''two'' actions if X was in bad faith (''mala fides''). These actions were (i) the ''vindicatio'' for the materials and (ii) the ''actio de tigno'', which would recoup twice the value of the materials. Additionally, Y would also have an action against a third party if that third party stole the materials.

In ''A Text-Book of Roman Law from Augustus to Justinian'', [[William Warwick Buckland|W.&amp;nbsp;W. Buckland]] discusses a third situation where X builds on Y's land using Z's materials. In such a situation, Buckland suggests that in relation to Y, X should be treated as though an XYX situation has occurred, and in relation to Z, as though an XXZ situation has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Text-Book of Roman Law from Augustus to Justinian|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521043687|pages=796|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5U8xwaGxb0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=xyx#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=W. W. Buckland|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plants and seeds====
X's plants and seeds acceded irreversibly to Y's soil once they have taken root, but Y must pay expenses if X is in legal possession, since X will have the exceptio dolus malus against Y's vindicatio.

====Rivers and new islands====
* [[Alluvion]]
* [[avulsion (river)|Avulsion]]

===Accession in relation to movables===
The accessory accedes to the principal. The debate is generally over which is the principal and which is the accessory. The principal owner owns regardless of good faith, bad faith, or consent. Possible tests that could be adopted in deciding this question include:
* Economic value
* Size
* Physical identity
* Relative non-economic value in terms of aesthetic value or labor

In Roman law, there was no consistency. Everything was decided on a [[Casuistry|casuistic]] basis. The Physical Identity test was the dominant test, i.e.,&amp;nbsp;the principal is that which gives its name to the final product and the accessory is that which has its identity merged and lost in the identity of the other. However, there are a number of special cases with special, and rather idiosyncratic rules, which are as follows:

* Writing (scripture) and painting (pictura)
* Threads and garments (textura)
* Confusio and commixtio

An '''advisory opinion''' is an opinion issued by a [[court]] or a commission like an [[Electoral Commission|election commission]] that does not have the effect of adjudicating a specific [[legal case]], but merely advises on the constitutionality or interpretation of a law.  Some countries have procedures by which the [[Executive branch|executive]] or [[legislative branch]]es may certify important questions to the [[judiciary]] and obtain an advisory opinion. In other countries or specific jurisdictions, courts may be prohibited from issuing advisory opinions.

==International courts==

===International Court of Justice===
{{see also|List of International Court of Justice cases}}
The [[International Court of Justice]] is empowered to give advisory opinions under Chapter IV of its Statute (an annex to the [[United Nations Charter]]) when requested to do so by certain organs or agencies of the [[United Nations]]. These opinions are non-binding, but Pieter H.F. Bekker has argued that this non-binding character does not mean that advisory opinions are without legal effect, because the legal reasoning embodied in them reflects the Court's authoritative views on important issues of international law and, in arriving at them, the Court follows essentially the same rules and procedures that govern its binding judgments delivered in contentious cases submitted to it by sovereign states. In his view, an advisory opinion derives its status and authority from the fact that it is the official pronouncement of the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asil.org/insights/insigh121.htm ''The UN General Assembly Requests a World Court Advisory Opinion On Israel's Separation Barrier''], Pieter H.F. Bekker, [http://www.asil.org/aboutasil/index.html ASIL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212214404/http://www.asil.org/aboutasil/index.html |date=2008-02-12 }} (American Society of International Law) Insights, December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advisory opinions have often been controversial, either because the questions asked were controversial, or because the case was pursued as a "backdoor" way of bringing what is really a contentious case before the Court.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Inter-American Court of Human Rights===
The advisory function of the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] enables it to respond to consultations submitted by agencies and member states of the [[Organization of American States]] regarding the interpretation of the [[American Convention on Human Rights]] or other instruments governing human rights in the [[Americas]]. It is also empowered to give advice on domestic laws and proposed legislation, and whether or not they are compatible with the Convention's provisions.
*List of [http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/iachr/series_A.html Advisory Opinions of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.]

==National courts==

===Australia===
The [[High Court of Australia]] is prohibited by the [[Constitution of Australia]] from issuing advisory opinions; a binding determination requires a controversy between two parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1921/20.html   Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts] (1921) 29 CLR 257 at 265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Kelly (journalist)#Personal life|Margaret Kelly]], Administrative Law, Pearson Law Briefs. P36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Zines, ''Cowen and Zines's Federal Jurisdiction in Australia'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; During certain episodes in Australia's legal history, such as the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]], politicians have sometimes solicited informal advice from Justices of the High Court in their personal capacity.

===Canada===
{{See also|Reference question}}
Under [[Law of Canada|Canadian law]], the [[reference question]] mechanism is equivalent to an advisory opinion.

The ''[[Supreme Court Act]]'' gives the federal Cabinet the power to refer questions to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on any questions of law.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/s-26/page-11.html#h-16 Supreme Court Act] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806155843/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/s-26/page-11.html#h-16 |date=August 6, 2014 }}'', R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26, s. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court then has jurisdiction to hold a hearing on the reference, just like an  appeal.  The Attorney General of Canada participates in a federal reference.  The provincial and territorial Attorneys General have the right to intervene, and interested parties may apply to intervene.  The parties make detailed written submissions to the Court, which then holds a hearing.  It typically reserves its decision, later releasing a written opinion. The Court has a discretion to refuse to answer questions which are too ambiguous or will not provide an answer with any meaning.

The Provincial governments and some of the territories have a similar power to refer questions to their highest appeal courts for an opinion.  This power is set out in their respective provincial laws defining the powers of the appellate courts.  The ''Supreme Court Act'' gives an automatic right of appeal from a reference decision of a provincial Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.

===India===
{{See also|Supreme Court of India}}

In [[India]], the [[President of India]] can request the [[Supreme Court of India]] to provide its advice on certain matters. This procedure is called ''"Presidential Reference"''. According to [[s:Constitution of India/Part V#Article 143 .7BPower of President to consult Supreme Court.7D|Article 143 of the Constitution of India]], the President of India may refer to the Supreme Court of India, a question of law or fact which, he thinks, is of public importance. However, it is ''not'' binding on the Supreme Court to answer questions raised in the reference.&lt;ref name="Presidential references: The how, why &amp; what next?"&gt;{{cite news|title=Presidential references: The how, why &amp; what next?|url=http://thefirm.moneycontrol.com/story_page.php?autono=692934|accessdate=23 October 2012|newspaper=moneycontrol.com|date=Apr 16, 2012|author=Payaswini Upadhyay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation
|1. If at any time it appears to the President that a question of law or fact has arisen, or is likely to arise, which is of such a nature and of such public importance that it is expedient to obtain the opinion of the Supreme Court upon it, he may refer the question to that Court for consideration and the Court may, after such hearing as it thinks fit, report to the President its opinion thereon.&lt;BR/&gt;
2. The President may, notwithstanding anything in the proviso to article 131, refer a dispute of the kind mentioned in the said proviso to the Supreme Court for opinion and the Supreme Court shall, after hearing as it thinks fit, report to the President its opinion thereon.

===Ireland===
{{seealso|Supreme Court of Ireland}}
===Nauru===
Article 55 of the [[Constitution of Nauru]] provides: "The [[President of Nauru|President]] or a Minister may, in accordance with the approval of the [[Cabinet of Nauru|Cabinet]], refer to the [[Supreme Court of Nauru|Supreme Court]] for its opinion any question concerning the interpretation or effect of any provision of this Constitution which has arisen or appears to the Cabinet likely to arise, and the Supreme Court shall pronounce in open court its opinion on the question."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paclii.org/nr/legis/num_act/con256/ Constitution of Nauru]&lt;/ref&gt;

This article has been put to use on six occasions, in the following cases, in which the Cabinet sought an advisory opinion from the Supreme Court on hypothetical cases relating to an interpretation of constitutional provisions: ''Three Questions Referred under Articles 36 &amp; 55 of the Constitution'' (1977); ''Four Questions Referred under Article 55 of the Constitution'' (1977); ''Constitutional Reference; In re Article 55 of the Constitution'' (2003); ''Constitutional Reference; In re Dual Nationality and Other Questions'' (2004); ''In the Matter of Article 55 &amp; 45 (and Article 36 &amp; 40) of the Constitution'' (2007); and ''In the Matter of Article 55 &amp; 45 (and Article 36 &amp; 40) of the Constitution'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paclii.org/nr/cases/NRSC/ Selected case law of the Supreme Court of Nauru], Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Constitutional Reference; In re Dual Nationality and Other Questions'' (2004), [[Chief Justice of Nauru|Chief Justice]] [[Barry Connell]] made the following remarks in relation to the nature of article 55:
:''The referral provision in the Constitution is an unusual process, not always available under other written constitutions but, nevertheless, Article 55 has been used on a number of occasions in Nauru. It is unusual in that Courts will not normally exercise jurisdiction in a case without a justiciable matter. Courts normally will not conduct a case on a hypothetical question. However, under Article 55, the Court is enjoined to give an Opinion where Cabinet, and only Cabinet, desires an interpretation or effect of a provision of the Constitution where the question has arisen or appears to the Cabinet likely to arise [...].''
:''On account of the nature of Article 55, the Court must limit itself to the questions asked. Whilst the Court gives what is termed an Opinion, one must realise that it is a constitutional opinion based on law. Such an Opinion carries legal weight, so far as it goes, but it must itself be susceptible to the normal canons of interpretation in the event of a particular disputed question brought before the Court.''&lt;ref&gt;Barry Connell CJ., ''[http://www.paclii.org/nr/cases/NRSC/2004/3.html Constitutional Reference; In re Dual Nationality and Other Questions]'' (2004), [[Supreme Court of Nauru]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
====Federal courts====
{{US fed civ pro}}
The [[United States Supreme Court]] has determined that the [[case or controversy]] requirement found in [[Article Three of the United States Constitution]] prohibits [[United States federal courts]] from issuing advisory opinions.  Accordingly, before the court will hear a case, it must find that the parties have a tangible interest at stake in the matter, the issue presented must be "mature for judicial resolution" or [[ripeness|ripe]], and a [[Justiciability|justiciable]] issue must remain before the court throughout the course of the lawsuit.  While this doctrine is still in full force, there has been a liberalization of these requirements in recent years.

In a letter to President  [[George Washington]],  replying to the president's request for such an opinion, then-Chief Justice [[John Jay]]  replied that it would violate the  [[separation of powers]]  for the Supreme Court to provide such an opinion,  noting that the president could rely on advice from anyone within the  [[executive branch]]  under  [[Article Two of the United States Constitution]]  which expressly permits the  [[President of the United States]]  to  "require the Opinion,  in writing,  of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments,  upon any subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices."  In other words,  Jay informed President Washington that the President ought to turn to the  [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]  and perhaps other Cabinet secretaries when they require legal advice concerning American law.  Over a century later the Court dismissed [[Muskrat v. United States|a case]] because there was no "actual controversy" between the parties;  thus, any opinion rendered would be advisory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to George Washington From John Jay, Chief Justice|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a3_2_1s34.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MUSKRAT v. UNITED STATES  https://www.oyez.org/cases/1901-1939/1910/1910_330&lt;/ref&gt;

====State courts====

Many [[State court (United States)|state courts]] are similarly barred from issuing advisory opinions, although there are often specific exceptions to these limitations. Some [[U.S. state|states]], like [[Rhode Island]], permit the governor to certify questions on the constitutionality of laws to the [[U.S. state|state]] supreme court. Also, some states require their supreme court to give advisory opinions on particular matters, such as whether proposed amendments to the [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]] violate the U.S. Constitution. Eight states have provisions in their constitutions permitting or requiring their supreme courts to give advisory opinions to the governor or legislature ([[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Maine]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Rhode Island]] and [[South Dakota]]), and  [[Alabama]] and [[Delaware]] provide for supreme court advisory opinions by statute.  The only book-length study of state advisory opinions, which collects the texts of all advisory opinion clauses, is Mel A. Topf, "A Doubtful and Perilous Experiment: Advisory Opinions, State Constitutions, and Judicial Supremacy" (Oxford University Press, 2011).  The book includes an annotated bibliography of all articles on the subject published since 1880.

Advisory opinions should not be confused with [[certified question]]s by one court to another, which are permissible.  U.S. federal courts, when confronted with real cases or controversies in which the federal court's decision will turn in whole or in part on a question of state law (e.g. [[diversity jurisdiction|diversity]] cases under the [[Erie doctrine|''Erie'' doctrine]] or issues in which federal law incorporates state law by reference, such as exemptions in [[bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]]), occasionally ask the highest court of the relevant state to give an authoritative answer to the state-law question, which the federal court will then apply to its resolution of the federal case  (see e.g. [[Abstention doctrine#Pullman abstention|''Pullman'' abstention]]).  Because the state court in such circumstances is giving an opinion that affects an actual case, it is not considered to be issuing an advisory opinion.

====Florida====

The [[Florida Supreme Court]] has two specific constitutional grants of authority to issue advisory opinions. First, it can issue an advisory opinion to the [[Governor of Florida]] on constitutional questions affecting the powers of the state's [[executive branch]].  Second, it can issue an advisory opinion to the [[Attorney General]] about two narrow legal issues affecting proposed citizens' initiatives to amend the [[Florida Constitution|state Constitution]].  These two issues are whether the ballot summary is fair and accurate and whether the initiative contains only a single subject as required by law.  The Florida Supreme Court cannot include any other issue in its advisory opinion, including whether or not the initiative would be constitutional if adopted by the voters in the required statewide election.

In June 2014, the UK government banned three more groups it suspected of being aliases for the extremist organisation al-Muhajiroun:&lt;ref name=bbc14&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-28049374 bbc.co.uk: "Ministers ban suspected aliases of banned extremist group"], BBC, 26 Jun 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Omar Bakri Muhammad]] and [[Anjem Choudary]] are known to have led Al-Muhajiroun.&lt;ref name=DYNAMITE&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3110115.stm Police raid Islamic group]| BBC News |30 July 2003 |accessed 2 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  Bakri founded Al-Muhajiroun in [[Mecca]], Saudi Arabia on 3 March 1983 following "the 59th anniversary of the destruction of the [[Ottoman Caliphate]]," in [[Jeddah]], Saudi Arabia.  According to at least one scholar ([[Sadek Hamid]]), the group was a front for [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] in the Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamid|first=Sadek|title=Islamic Political Radicalism: A European Perspective|date=2007|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-74863-086-4|pages=148|editor=Tahir Abbas|chapter=Islamic Political Radicalism in Britain: the case of Hizb-ut-Tahrir|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hilBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145 |ref=IPRBcHT2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (where political parties are illegal). According to Bakri, the Hizb ut-Tahrir leadership did not accept the group. As such, Bakri established Al-Muhajiroun independently from Hizb ut-Tahrir.&lt;ref name=OTAIBI&gt;

Bakri claims that he studied at the universities of Umm ul-Qura' in Makkah and the [[Islamic University of Madinah]].&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Fiqh'', Bakri (London: The Islamic Book Company, 1996), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Bakri also studied with, and was assessed by, Dr. [[Abdur Rahman Dimishqia]].&lt;ref name="Hizb ut-Tahreer"&gt;''Hizb ut-Tahreer'', Dr. Abdur Rahman Dimishqia,  (Istanbul: Maktabah ul-Ghurabaa', 1417 AH/1997 CE)&lt;/ref&gt; While living in Saudi Arabia he worked for ''Eastern Electric'' owned by Shamsan and [[Abdul-Aziz as-Suhaybi]] in [[Riyadh]], and then Bakri moved to its Jeddah branch. Later he traveled to America to study English after which he went to the UK to assume the leadership of Hizb ut-Tahrir.&lt;ref name ="Hizb ut-Tahreer" /&gt;

The [[Saudi Arabian government]] banned Al-Muhajiroun in January 1986, prompting Bakri to leave. On 14 January 1986, he arrived in Britain, where he worked as part of Hizb ut-Tahrir.&lt;ref name=OTAIBI/&gt; Bakri's involvement in Hizb ut-Tahrir ended on 16 January 1996 when he was dismissed by the group's global leadership. Following the emergence of Al-Muhajiroun in early 1996, Bakri would later become the chief sponsor in Britain of the [[International Islamic Front]], an organization that trained and sent British Citizens to fight in [[Chechnya]] and the [[Balkans]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

===NUS ban===
In March 2001 Britain's [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] banned Al-Muhajiroun after they received complaints from Muslim and non-Muslim students about the group distributing [[hate literature]] and the organization training members in militant camps.  Al-Muhajiroun members put up posters and handed out leaflets in [[Manchester University]]'s campus where the police were called and at the [[University of Birmingham]] campus that called for the killing of Jews.  A spokesman for NUS said that if Al-Muhajiroun did not support violence against Jews then they should change their "highly militant and definitely not peaceful" literature.&lt;ref name=GENOCIDE&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20011122202951/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewPrint.asp?Page=%5CForeignBureaus%5Carchive%5C200109%5CFor20010921g.html UK Islamic Group, Banned from Campus, Claims Misrepresentation]| [[CNS News]]| Mike Wendling | September 21, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic Council of Britain===
[[Abu Hamza al-Masri]] created the [[Islamic Council of Britain]] to "implement sharia law in Britain," on 11 September 2002, the first anniversary of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], primarily through funding from Al-Muhajiroun. Masri celebrated the establishment of the ICB and the 9/11 attacks by holding a conference in [[Finsbury Park mosque]] in [[North London]] entitled "September the 11th 2001: A Towering Day in History." Bakri, who attended the conference, said, that attendees "look at September 11 like a battle, as a great achievement by the [[mujahideen]] against the evil superpower. I never praised September 11 after it happened but now I can see why they did it." Flyers distributed at the conference referred to the 9/11 hijackers as the "Magnificent 19." Bakri said he saw [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists as "sincere [and] devoted people who stood firm against the invasion of a Muslim country." [[Anjem Choudary]], British spokesman for Al Muhajiroun also attended.&lt;ref name=ORIGIN/&gt; Just days after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] the Oxford-based Malaysian jurist, [[Afifi al-Akiti|Shaykh Muhammad Afifi al-Akiti]], issued his landmark fatwa against suicide bombing and targeting innocent civilians, titled [http://www.livingislam.org/maa/dcmm_e.html ''Defending the Transgressed, by Censuring the Reckless against the Killing of Civilians''], which was written in response to this controversial "Magnificent 19" statement made by Al-Muhajiroun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warda.info/fatwa.pdf ''Defending the Transgressed'' (2005), p. 17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 disbandment and after===
Al Muhajiroun disbanded on 13 October 2004&lt;ref name=DISBANDMENT&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1540082/Muslims-in-police-will-rise-up-Bakri-insists.html telegraph.co.uk: "Muslims in police will rise up, Bakri insists"], 21 Jan 2007&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid proscription.&lt;ref name="Raymond-2010-6"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raymond|first1=Catherine Zara|title=Al Muhajiroun and Islam4UK: The group behind the ban|date=May 2010|publisher=International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR)|page=6|url=http://icsr.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1276697989CatherineZaraRaymondICSRPaper.pdf|accessdate=2 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220154059/http://icsr.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/1276697989CatherineZaraRaymondICSRPaper.pdf|archive-date=20 December 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was believed that [[The Saviour Sect]] was to all intents and purposes Al Muhajiroun operating under a new name. Shortly after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] Tony Blair announced the group would be banned as part of a series of measures against condoning or glorifying terrorism.&lt;ref name=DISBANDMENT/&gt;

[[Home Secretary]] [[Charles Clarke]] banned [[Omar Bakri Muhammad]] from the United Kingdom on 12 August 2005 on the grounds that his presence was "not conducive to the public good."&lt;ref name=ORIGIN&gt;[http://www.aina.org/news/20060424105053.htm Islamists Down Under]| Assyrian International News Agency| 2006-04-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jan/11/islam4uk-al-muhajiroun-ban-laws Extremist Islamist groups to be banned under new terror laws] Guardian Online | 2010 january 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CLARKE&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,22989-1733144,00.html 'Preacher of hate' is banned from Britain] Times Online&lt;/ref&gt; Two other offshoot organisations, [[The Saviour Sect]] and [[Al-Ghurabaa]] had previously been banned for the 'glorification' of terrorism under the [[Terrorism Act 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://security.homeoffice.gov.uk/legislation/current-legislation/terrorism-act-2000/proscribed-groups.html |title=Proscribed terrorist groups  |accessdate=14 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118084213/http://security.homeoffice.gov.uk/legislation/current-legislation/terrorism-act-2000/proscribed-groups.html |archivedate=18 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrorism==

===Statements===
Aside from declaring the [[Hijackers_in_the_September_11_attacks|9/11 hijackers]] "the Magnificent 19", controversial statements made by al-Muhajiroun include one warning the British government that it was "sitting on a box of dynamite and have only themselves to blame if after attacking the Islamic movements and the Islamic scholars, it all blows up in their face".&lt;ref name=DYNAMITE/&gt;

In 2004 [[BBC Newsnight]] quoted one Al-Muhajiroun leader, [[Sajeel Shahid|Abu Ibrahim]], as saying,
&lt;blockquote&gt;When they speak about 11 September, when the two planes magnificently run through those buildings, OK and people turn around and say, 'hang on a second, that is barbaric. Why did you have to do that?' You know why? Because of ignorance. ... For us it's retaliation. Islam is not the starter of wars. If you start the war we won't turn the other cheek. ... According to you it can't be right. According to Islam it's right. When you talk about innocent civilians, do you not kill innocent civilians in Iraq?&lt;ref name=IBRAHIM&gt;

===Attacks===
On 29 April 2003, Asif Hanif who attended some of Al-Muhajiroun's circles carried out a bombing of a café in [[Tel Aviv]], Israel, that killed three people and injured 60 others.&lt;ref name=NetworkDoward&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doward|first1=Jamie|last2=Wander|first2=Andrew|title=The network|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/06/terrorism.jamiedoward|work=The Observer|date=6 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CIVILDEATHS&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,249521,00.html New poll shows worry over Islamic terror threat, to be detailed in special FNC Report] Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, another individual connected with Al-Muhajiroun allegedly detonated a [[suicide bombing|bomb]] in India, killing himself and destroying an army barracks.&lt;ref name=ORIGIN/&gt;

In 2007, five young Muslims with Al-Muhajiroun connections  – [[Omar Khyam]], [[Waheed Mahmood]], Anthony Garcia, [[Jawad Akbar]] and [[Saladhuddin Amin]] – were convicted of a [[Operation Crevice|multiple bombing plot]] to use fertiliser bombs "which police say could have killed hundreds of British people. The men were caught after police and MI5 launched a massive surveillance operation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6153884.stm Fertiliser bomb plot: The story. By Chris Summers and Dominic Casciani. 30 April 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The surveillance culminated in a raid called [[Operation Crevice]]. The targets included "the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, the Ministry of Sound nightclub in London and Britain's domestic gas network." According to Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Brunel Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The fertiliser bomb trial has given us the smoking-gun evidence that groups like al-Muhajiroun have had an important part in radicalising young British Muslims, and that this can create terrorists.&lt;ref name=NetworkDoward/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 22 May 2013, the [[murder of Lee Rigby]] was carried out by two members of Al-Muhajiroun, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. From about 2003, Adebolajo was corrupted by Bakri and then by Choudary,&lt;ref name=dtlr/&gt; after Bakri left the country in August 2005.&lt;ref name=PUBLICGOOD&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4133150.stm|title=Cleric Bakri 'will return' to UK|publisher=BBC News|date=9 August 2005|accessdate=12 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One former associate said Adebolajo that “locked himself in this room with this bloke for a few hours and when he came out he was a Muslim convert. He was spouting all kinds of stuff and said he had changed his name." Adebolajo insisted to be called during the Rigby trial "[[Mujahid]]".&lt;ref name=dtlr&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10528365/Lee-Rigby-killers-from-quiet-Christians-to-Islamist-murderers.html |title=Lee Rigby killers: from quiet Christians to Islamist murderers |publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=15 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986''' was a law of the [[War on Drugs]] passed by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]]. Among other things, they changed the system of [[federal supervised release]] from a rehabilitative system into a punitive system. The 1986 Act also prohibited [[controlled substance analog]]s. The bill enacted new [[Mandatory sentencing|mandatory minimum sentences]] for drugs, including [[marijuana]].&lt;ref name=pbssnitch&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/snitch/primer/ Snitch: Drug Laws and Snitching&amp;nbsp;– a Primer].

The article also has a chart of mandatory minimum sentences for first time drug offenders.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=frontlinedrugwars&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/drugs/cron/ Thirty Years of America's Drug War].

== History ==

The appearance of [[crack cocaine]], the June 19, 1986 death of [[Len Bias]] (University of Maryland basketball star), the morning after he signed with the NBA champion Boston Celtics, and the June 27, 1986 death of [[Don Rogers (safety)]] (Cleveland Browns, 1985 Defensive Rookie of the Year) -- both from cocaine use,{{sfn|Easley|2011}} encouraged U.S. Rep. Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill, Jr. (D-MA), the Speaker of the House of Representatives, to mobilize the House Democratic leadership to assemble an omnibus anti-drug bill that became the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. &lt;ref name="PBS Frontline Snitch"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/snitch/procon/sterling.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The congressional interest and intense news coverage created a [[moral panic]] surrounding [[cocaine]] use, which had earlier been viewed in a more benign or even positive way.{{sfn|Musto|2005|p=11}} that made enacting this legislation so important. &lt;ref&gt; Reinarman and Levine, "Crack in America: Demon Drugs and Social Justice", Univ. of Cal. Press, 1997 &lt;/ref&gt; In September and October of 1986, the House (with a Democratic majority) and the Senate (with a Republican majority) competed over which could propose the most severe laws in advance of the pivotal midterm election.{{sfn|Musto|2005|p=12}}

A few House [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] expressed considerable concern about the provisions of the bill. However, most ultimately voted for it, describing election pressures and fear of criticism as swaying their decision. Representative [[Mike Lowry]] (D), who voted against the bill, described the process as "legislation by political panic". Representative [[Charles Schumer]] (D), who voted in favor of the bill, said "the policies are aimed at looking good rather than solving the problem." The House passed the Senate version with a 378–16 majority on October 17, 1986.{{sfn|Murakawa|2014|p=133}}

== Contents ==

=== Money Laundering Control Act ===
The Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 was enacted as Title I of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act.{{sfn|Richards|1998|p=136}}{{sfn|Pollard|Daly|2014|p=16.19}} This title [[criminalization|criminalized]] [[money laundering]] for the first time in the United States.{{sfn|Pollard|Daly|2014|p=16.19}} It also amended the [[Bank Secrecy Act]], the [[Change in Bank Control Act]], and the [[Right to Financial Privacy Act]]{{sfn|Pollard|Daly|2014|p=16.19}}
&lt;!-- There is substantially more literature on the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986 --&gt;

=== Drug crimes ===

Along with the [[Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984]], the act substantially increased the number of drug offenses with mandatory minimum sentences.{{sfn|Reamer|2005|p=134}}

This act mandated a minimum sentence of 5 years without parole for possession of 5 grams of crack cocaine while it mandated the same for possession of 500 grams of powder cocaine. This 100:1 disparity was reduced to 18:1, when crack was increased to 28 grams (1 ounce) by the [[Fair Sentencing Act]] of 2010.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

=== Spending ===

The act [[Authorization bill#Authorization-appropriation process|authorized]] billions of dollars of spending, although substantially less was actually [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriated]]. Some of this was used to increase the substance abuse treatment federal [[block grant]] program,{{sfn|Landsberg|2004|p=213}} although treatment providers were disappointed at the reduced appropriations following politicians' earlier promises and authorization.{{sfn|Musto|2005|p=12}}

Other programs funded by the act included drug counseling and education programs,{{sfn|Pollard|Daly|2014|p=16.19}} [[AIDS research]],{{sfn|Landsberg|2004|p=213}} and international cooperation to limit drug production.{{sfn|Pollard|Daly|2014|p=16.19}}

The Act also included the ''Drug Free Schools and Communities Act'', which required colleges to establish drug abuse education and prevention programs.{{sfn|Dowdall|2013|p=128}}

== Impact ==

The law led to an increase in average time imprisoned for drug crimes from 22 months to 33 months.{{sfn|Shewan|2013|p=89f}}

[[File:D.C. Court of Appeals.JPG|thumb|The [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
'''United States appellate procedure''' involves the rules and regulations for filing [[appeal]]s in [[state court (United States)|state courts]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. The nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the [[jurisdiction]] where the case was prosecuted. There are many types of [[standard of review]] for appeals, such as ''[[Trial de novo|de novo]]'' and [[abuse of discretion]]. However, most appeals begin when a party files a [[petition for review]] to a higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower court's decision.

An [[appellate court]] is a [[court]] that hears cases on appeal from another court. Depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance, a party to a [[court case]] who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds. These grounds typically could include errors of law, [[fact]], procedure or due process. In different jurisdictions, appellate courts are also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts.

The specific procedures for appealing, including even whether there is a right of appeal from a particular type of decision, can vary greatly from state to state. The right to file an appeal can also vary from state to state; for example, the [[New Jersey Constitution]] vests judicial power in a Supreme Court, a Superior Court, and other courts of limited jurisdiction, with an appellate court being part of the Superior Court.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 1:2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access to appellant status==
A party who files an appeal is called an "appellant", "plaintiff in error", "petitioner" or "pursuer", and a party on the other side is called a "appellee". A "cross-appeal" is an appeal brought by the respondent. For example, suppose at trial the judge found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay $50,000. If the defendant files an appeal arguing that he should not have to pay any money, then the plaintiff might file a cross-appeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay $200,000 instead of $50,000.

The appellant is the party who, having lost part or all their [[lawsuit|claim]] in a [[lower court]] decision, is appealing to a higher court to have their case reconsidered. This is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law, but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct, or that a finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence.

The appellant in the new case can be either the [[plaintiff]] (or claimant), [[defendant]], third-party [[intervenor]], or respondent (appellee) from the lower case, depending on who was the losing party. The winning party from the lower court, however, is now the respondent. In unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below, but still appeal.

An appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court [[judgment (law)|judgment]] was in its favor. The appellee is required to respond to the [[petition]], [[oral argument]]s, and [[legal brief]]s of the appellant. In general, the appellee takes the procedural posture that the lower court's decision should be affirmed.

==Ability to appeal==
An appeal "as of right" is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle.  The appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal.  An appeal "by leave" or "permission" requires the appellant to obtain leave to appeal; in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the court may have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant's demand to appeal the lower court's decision. In the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], review in most cases is available only if the Court exercises its discretion and grants a writ of certiorari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/supct/10.html|title=U.S. Supreme Court Rule 10|publisher=Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[tort]], [[equity (law)|equity]], or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal.  In criminal matters, however, the state or prosecution generally has no appeal "as of right".  And due to the [[double jeopardy]] principle, the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict of acquittal.  But in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal "as of right" from a trial court's dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial court's granting of a defendant's suppression motion.  Likewise, in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law "by leave" from the trial court or the appellate court.  The ability of the prosecution to appeal a decision in favor of a defendant varies significantly internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/publications/data/lrc119/lrc_119.html |title=Consultation Paper on Prosecution Appeals Brought in Cases of Indictment |publisher=Law Reform Commission of Ireland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119043436/http://www.lawreform.ie/publications/data/lrc119/lrc_119.html |archivedate=November 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All parties must present grounds to appeal, or it will not be heard.

By convention in some law reports, the appellant is named first.  This can mean that where it is the defendant who appeals, the name of the case in the law reports reverses (in some cases twice) as the appeals work their way up the court hierarchy. This is not always true, however.  In the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]], the parties' names always stay in the same order as the lower court when an appeal is taken to the [[United States Courts of Appeals|circuit courts of appeals]], and are re-ordered only if the appeal reaches the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Direct or collateral: Appealing criminal convictions==
Many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals, particularly in the criminal context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/postconv.htm|title=UK Law Online |publisher=University of Leeds }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03 |url=http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/28C154.txt |title=Special Habeas Corpus Procedures in Capital Cases |publisher=United States Office of the Law Revision Counsel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228011124/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/28C154.txt |archivedate=February 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03 |url=http://www.twelfth.courts.state.oh.us/Decisions/Pre00011.doc |title=State of Ohio |publisher=Ohio 12th District Court of Appeals |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227072142/http://www.twelfth.courts.state.oh.us/Decisions/Pre00011.doc |archivedate=February 27, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is the traditional "direct" appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review.  The second is the collateral appeal or post-conviction petition, in which the petitioner-appellant files the appeal in a court of first instance—usually the court that tried the case.

The key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts, and the latter in federal courts.{{dubious|Non-federal collateral review|date=May 2017}}

Relief in post-conviction is rare and is most often found in [[capital punishment|capital]] or violent [[felony]] cases.  The typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating [[DNA]] evidence demonstrating the defendant's actual innocence.

===Appellate review===
"Appellate review" is the general term for the process by which courts with appellate [[jurisdiction]] take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts. It is distinguished from [[Judicial review (theory)|judicial review]], which refers to the court's overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if a legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons (which may vary by jurisdiction).

In most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final [[Legal judgment|judgment]]. Generally, an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case.  This is because such orders cannot be appealed "as of right". However, certain critical interlocutory [[court order]]s, such as the denial of a request for an interim [[injunction]], or an order holding a person in [[contempt of court]], can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of.

There are two distinct forms of appellate review, "direct" and "collateral". For example, a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court, and lose on "direct appeal" to higher state appellate courts, and if unsuccessful, mount a "collateral" action such as filing for a writ of [[habeas corpus]] in the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. Generally speaking, "[d]irect appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of a judgment and allege errors of law or fact. ... [Collateral review], on the other hand, provide[s] an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of a conviction and sentence, and as such are generally limited to challenges to constitutional, jurisdictional, or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial." "Graham v. Borgen", 483 F 3d. 475 (7th Cir. 2007) (no. 04-4103) (slip op. at 7) (citation omitted).

In Anglo-American [[common law]] courts, appellate review of lower court decisions may also be obtained by filing a petition for review by [[prerogative writ]] in certain cases.  There is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal systems, though some mixed systems such as [[Civil Code of Quebec|Quebec]] recognize these prerogative writs.

====Direct Appeal====
After exhausting the first appeal as of right, defendants usually petition the highest state court to review the decision. This appeal is known as a direct appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bickford|first=James|title=Opinion Recap:All Judicial Review is either direct or collateral|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/03/opinion-summary-all-judicial-review-is-either-direct-or-collateral/|work=Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act|publisher=SCOTUS Bblog|accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest state court, generally known as the Supreme Court, exercises discretion over whether it will review the case. On direct appeal, a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process.

=====Preservation Issues=====
An appellant's claim(s) must usually be preserved at trial. This means that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial. Because constitutional claims are of great magnitude, appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved. For example, Connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims: 1.the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; 2. the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; 3. the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; 4. if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dauman|first=Chad|title=Criminal Appeals in the United States: Preservation Issues|url=http://www.Chaddauman.blogspot.com|work=blog|accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State Post Conviction Relief: Collateral Appeal====
All States have a post-conviction relief process.  Similar to federal post-conviction relief, an appellant can petition the court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were not corrected on direct review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yackle|first=Larry|title=Federal Courts, Habeas Corpus|year=2003|publisher=Thomson Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typical claims might include [[ineffective assistance of counsel]] and actual innocence based on new evidence. These proceedings are normally separate from the direct appeal, however some states allow for collateral relief to be sought on direct appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courts.mi.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/rules/Documents/CHAPTER%207.%20APPELLATE%20RULES%20(entire%20chapter).pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; After direct appeal, the conviction is considered final. An appeal from the post conviction court proceeds just as a direct appeal. That is, it goes to the intermediate appellate court, followed by the highest court. If the petition is granted the appellant could be released from incarceration, the sentence could be modified, or a new trial could be ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Process For Post-Conviction Relief|url=http://www.doj.state.or.us/victims/pdf/pcvap_handout_post_conviction.pdf|work=Oregon Department of Justice|publisher=Oregon Department of Justice|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Habeas Corpus====

==Notice of appeal==
A "notice of appeal" is a form or document that in many cases is required to begin an appeal. The form is completed by the appellant or by the appellant's legal representative. The nature of this form can vary greatly from country to country and from court to court within a country.

The specific rules of the legal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun. For example, the appellant might have to file the notice of appeal with the appellate court, or with the court from which the appeal is taken, or both.

Some courts have samples of a notice of appeal on the court's own web site.  In New Jersey, for example, the Administrative Office of the Court has promulgated a form of notice of appeal for use by appellants, though using this exact form is not mandatory and the failure to use it is not a jurisdictional defect provided that all pertinent information is set forth in whatever form of notice of appeal is used.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

The deadline for beginning an appeal can often be very short: traditionally, it is measured in days, not months. This can vary from country to country, as well as within a country, depending on the specific rules in force. In the U.S. federal court system, criminal defendants must file a notice of appeal within 10 days of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed, or the right to appeal is forfeited.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Rule 4(b)(1)(A)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28a/usc_sec_28a_00000004----000-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appellate procedure==
{{See also|United States courts of appeals}}
Generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not.  The appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower court's findings of fact (such as whether a defendant committed a particular act), unless clearly erroneous, and so will focus on the court's application of the law to those facts (such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue).

If the appellate court finds no defect, it "affirms" the judgment.  If the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision "below" (i.e., in the lower court), it may "modify" the ruling to correct the defect, or it may nullify ("reverse" or "vacate") the whole decision or any part of it.  It may, in addition, send the case back ("remand" or "remit") to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect.

In some cases, an appellate court may review a lower court decision "de novo" (or completely), challenging even the lower court's findings of fact.  This might be the proper standard of review, for example, if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pre-trial [[motion to dismiss]] or motion for [[summary judgment]] which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony.

Another situation is where appeal is by way of "re-hearing". Certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court.

Sometimes, the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits, which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below.  (This would happen, for example, if the appellant waited too long, under the appellate court's rules, to file the appeal.)

Generally, there is no [[Jury trial|trial]] in an appellate court, only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre-trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed—unless the appeal is by way of re-hearing, new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in "very" rare instances, for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as [[prosecutorial misconduct]].

In some systems, an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court, together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal. In other systems, the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court. In those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court.

The appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee (or respondent) can present arguments against it.  Arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers, if represented, or "[[pro se]]" if the party has not engaged legal representation.  Those arguments are presented in written [[brief (law)|briefs]] and sometimes in [[oral argument]] to the court at a [[hearing (law)|hearing]]. At such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs.

In an [[adversarial system]], appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it. Therefore, if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner, or against [[Precedent|legal precedent]], that judgment will stand if not appealed – even if it might have been overturned on appeal.

The United States legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals: a trial "de novo" or an appeal on the record.

A [[trial de novo]] is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial [[trial (law)|trial]].  If unchallenged, these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all.  If a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal, one generally has the power to request a trial "de novo" by a [[court of record]].  In such a proceeding, all issues and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] may be developed newly, as though never heard before, and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding.  Sometimes, however, the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence, thus helping to curb frivolous appeals.

In some cases, an application for "trial de novo" effectively erases the prior trial as if it had never taken place.  The Supreme Court of Virginia has stated that '"This Court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to "annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial."'&lt;ref&gt;"Gaskill v. Commonwealth", 206 Va. 486, 490, 144 S.E.2d 293, 296 (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;  The only exception to this is that if a defendant appeals a conviction for a crime having multiple levels of offenses, where they are convicted on a lesser offense, the appeal is of the lesser offense; the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses. "[A] trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles, . . . subject only to the limitation that conviction in [the] district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense,
permitting trial de novo in the circuit court only for the lesser-included offense."&lt;ref&gt;"Kenyon v. Commonwealth", 37 Va. App. 668, 673, 561 S.E.2d 17, 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

In an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding, both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal.  Each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result.  [[Precedent]] and [[case law]] figure prominently in the arguments.  In order for the appeal to succeed, the appellant must prove that the lower court committed [[reversible error]], that is, an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust, and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly.  Some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case, permitting seriously [[improper argument]] by an attorney, admitting or excluding evidence improperly, acting outside the court's jurisdiction, injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so, juror misconduct, etc.  The failure to formally object at the time, to what one views as improper action in the lower court, may result in the affirmance of the lower court's judgment on the grounds that one did not "preserve the issue for appeal" by objecting.

In cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact, an appellate court will apply an "abuse of discretion" standard of review. Under this standard, the appellate court gives deference to the lower court's view of the evidence, and reverses its decision only if it were a clear abuse of discretion. This is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness.  On the other hand, the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower court's decision on issues of law, and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard.

In some cases, an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] or otherwise invalid, or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered.  In the case of new evidence, there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial.  Another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel. If a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation, he is entitled to a new trial.

A lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words "May it please the court."

After an appeal is heard, the "mandate" is a formal notice of a decision by a court of appeal; this notice is transmitted to the trial court and, when filed by the [[Court clerk|clerk]] of the trial court, constitutes the final judgment on the case, unless the appeal court has directed further proceedings in the trial court. The mandate is distinguished from the appeal court's [[court opinion|opinion]], which sets out the legal reasoning for its decision. In some jurisdictions the mandate is known as the "remittitur".

==Results==
The result of an appeal can be:
:*&lt;span id="Affirmed"&gt;Affirmed&lt;/span&gt;: Where the reviewing court basically agrees with the result of the lower courts ruling(s). 
:*&lt;span id="Reversed"&gt;Reversed&lt;/span&gt;: Where the reviewing court basically disagrees with the result of the lower courts ruling(s), and overturns their decision.
:*&lt;span id="Vacated"&gt;Vacated&lt;/span&gt;: Where the reviewing court overturns the lower courts ruling(s) as invalid, without necessarily disagreeing with it/them, e.g. because the case was decided on the basis of a legal principle that no longer applies.
:*&lt;span id="Remanded"&gt;Remanded&lt;/span&gt;: Where the reviewing court sends the case back to the lower court.

There can be multiple outcomes, so that the reviewing court can affirm some rulings, reverse others and remand the case all at the same time. Remand is not required where there is nothing left to do in the case.  "Generally speaking, an appellate court's judgment provides 'the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified'".&lt;ref&gt;State v. Randolph, 210 N.J. 330, 350 n.5 (2012), citing Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 28:2&lt;/ref&gt;

Some reviewing courts who have discretionary review may send a case back without comment other than ''review improvidently granted''. In other words, after looking at the case, they chose not to say anything.  The result for the case of ''review improvidently granted'' is effectively the same as affirmed, but without that extra higher court stamp of approval.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2789">The '''Armistice of Erzincan''' (also spelled '''Erzindzhan''' or '''Erzinjan''') was an agreement to suspend hostilities during [[World War I]] signed by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Transcaucasian Commissariat]] in [[Erzincan]] on 18 December 1917 (5 December [[Old Style|O.S.]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Tadeusz Swietochowski]], ''Russian Azerbaijan, 1905–1920'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Slusser&gt;Robert M. Slusser and Jan F. Triska (1959), ''A Calendar of Soviet Treaties, 1917–1957'' (Stanford University Press), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The armistice brought temporary peace to the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasian]] and [[Persian Campaign|Persian Fronts]] until 12 February, when the fighting was resumed.

The status of the Transcaucasian Commissariat was unclear at the time: the Ottomans regarded it as an independent entity, a legal successor of the [[Russian Empire]], while the Commissariat still considered itself a part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]]. The Ottoman Empire was already party to the [[Armistice between Russia and the Central Powers|Brest-Litovsk armistice with Russia]] (15 December) that covered the Caucasian and Persian Fronts. After receiving a ceasefire proposal from [[Vehib Pasha]], commander of the Ottoman [[Third Army (Ottoman)|Third Army]], the Commissariat authorised the commander of the Russian [[Caucasus Front (Russian Republic)|Caucasus Front]], General Przhevalski, to negotiate an armistice with his Ottoman opposite. The result was the Erzincan Armistice, after which the Russian troops began to withdraw, leaving the Transcaucasian Commissariat completely undefended.

A supplement to the armistice was signed on the same day, demarcating the line of occupation between the two sides.&lt;ref name=Slusser/&gt; On 12 February, Ottoman forces began advancing across the line in defiance of the armistice, having rejected the Transcaucasian Commissariat's authority to sign it and accused the [[Armenian people|Armenians]] of massacring Muslims behind the Ottoman line on 15–16 January.{{fact|date=August 2016}} On 24 February the Brest-Litovsk armistice was broken by Germany and became of no effect. Both armistices were superseded by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] with Russia, signed on 3 March 1918, and the [[Treaty of Batum]] with the successor states of the Transcaucasian Commissariat, signed 4 June.

The '''Arms Act 1983''' is the primary statute controlling the possession and use of [[firearm]]s and [[air gun]]s in [[New Zealand]].

== Basic principles of the Act ==

The basic premise of the New Zealand arms control regime is the [[Firearms licence (New Zealand)|licensing of individuals]] as being fit and proper persons to possess firearms. Firearms themselves are not generally registered or licensed, although exceptions exist for pistols, restricted weapons and [[military-style semi-automatic]] firearms (MSSAs).

== History of the Act ==

The act came into force on 1 June 1984, replacing the Arms Act 1958 (1958 No 21).

It has subsequently been amended by the following statutes:
*Arms Amendment Act 1985 (No 5)
*Crimes Amendment Act (No 2) 1986 (No 71)
*Arms Amendment Act 1987 (No 166)
*Public Finance Act 1989 (No 44)
*Regulations (Disallowance) Act 1989 (No 143)
*Arms Amendment Act 1992 (No 95)
*Domestic Violence Act 1995 (No 86)
*Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 (No 30)
*Crimes Amendment Act (No 2) 1997 (No 93)
*Postal Services Act 1998 (No 2)
*Anti-Personnel Mines Prohibition Act 1998 (No 111)
*Arms Amendment Act 1999 (No 23)
*Arms Amendment Act 2000 (No 53)
*Visiting Forces Act 2004 (No 59)
*Policing Act 2008 (No 72)
*Cluster Munitions Prohibition Act 2009 (No 68)

== Operation of the Act ==

The Act is administered by the [[New Zealand Police]]. The full legislative framework of the arms control regime is defined by the Act in conjunction with:
*The Arms (Restricted Weapons and Specially Dangerous Airguns) Order 1984
*The Arms Regulations 1992

The act grants the police considerable discretion in the administration of the arms control regime. Police policy in respect of the arms regime is documented in their ''Arms Manual'' 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/arms-manual-2002 |title=Arms Manual 2002 |date=2014 |publisher=New Zealand Police |accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provisions of the Act ==

The act contains provisions for the following:
*the licensing of dealers
*the importation of firearms
*general restrictions on possession of firearms and airguns
*[[Firearms licence (New Zealand)|licensing of those using and possessing firearms]]
*the procurement and carrying of pistols, MSSAs and restricted weapons
*firearms offences
*police powers of search &amp; seizure in respect of firearms

In [[law]], a '''citation''' or '''introductory signal''' is a set of phrases or words used to clarify the authority (or significance) of a [[legal citation]] as it relates to a proposition. It is used in citations to present [[Authority (textual criticism)|authorities]] and indicate how those authorities relate to [[proposition]]s in statements. [[Legal writer]]s use citation signals to tell readers how the citations support (or do not support) their propositions, organizing citations in a hierarchy of importance so the reader can quickly determine the relative weight of a citation. Citation signals help a reader to discern meaning or usefulness of a reference when the reference itself provides inadequate information.

Citation signals have different meanings in different U.S. [[Citation#Styles|citation-style systems]]. The two most prominent citation manuals are ''The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalbluebook.com/ |title=The Bluebook |publisher=Legalbluebook.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''ALWD Citation Manual''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alwd.org/cm/ |title=Index of /cm |publisher=Alwd.org |date=2008-07-28 |accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some state-specific style manuals also provide guidance on legal citation.  The ''[[Bluebook]]'' citation system is the most comprehensive and the most widely used system by courts, law firms and law reviews.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=={{anchor|Usage}}Use==
Most citation signals are placed in front of the citation to which they apply. In the paragraph
&lt;blockquote&gt;When writing a legal argument, it is important to refer to primary sources.  To assist readers in locating these sources, it is desirable to use a standardized citation format. See generally Harvard Law Review Association, ''The Bluebook:  A Uniform System of Citation'' (18th ed. 2005). Note, however, that some courts may require any legal papers that are submitted to them to conform to a different citation format.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
the signal is "see generally", which indicates that ''The [[Bluebook]]: A Uniform System of Citation'' (18th ed. 2005) provides background information on the topic.

=={{anchor|Signal details|Signals that indicate support|[no signal]}}Signals indicating support==

===No signal===
When writers do not signal a citation, the cited authority states the proposition, is the source of the cited quotation or identifies an authority referred to in the text; for example,
a court points out that "the proper role of the trial and appellate courts in the federal system in reviewing the size of jury verdicts is a matter of federal law"&lt;ref&gt;''Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities'', 518 U.S. 415 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; or "Bilida was prosecuted in state court for the misdemeanor offense of possessing the raccoon without a permit".&lt;ref&gt;R.I. Gen. Laws 20-1-16 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''e.g.''===
This signal, an abbreviation of the Latin ''exempli gratia'', means "for example". It tells the reader that the citation supports the proposition; although other authorities also support the proposition, their citation(s) may not be useful or necessary. This signal may be used in combination with other signals, preceded by an italicized comma. The comma after ''e.g.'', is not italicized when attached to another signal at the end (whether supportive or not), but is italicized when ''e.g.'' appears alone.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Examples: Parties challenging state abortion laws have sharply disputed in some courts the contention that a purpose of these laws, when enacted, was to protect prenatal life. ''See, e.g.'', ''Abele v. Markle'', 342 F. Supp. 800 (D. Conn.1972), appeal docketed, No. 72-56. Unfortunately, hiring undocumented laborers is a widespread industry practice. ''E.g.'', ''Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Bellefonte Ins.  Co.'', 548 F. Supp. 1329, 1331 (E.D. Pa. 1982).

===Accord===
"Accord" is used when two or more sources state or support the proposition, but the text quotes (or refers to) only one; the other sources are then introduced by "accord". Legal writers often use ''accord'' to indicate that the law of one jurisdiction is in accord with that of another jurisdiction. Examples: "[N]ervousness alone does not justify extended detention and questioning about matters not related to the stop." ''United States v. Chavez-Valenzuela'', 268 F.3d 719,725 (9th Cir. 2001); ''accord United States v. Beck'', 140 F.3d 1129, 1139 (8th Cir. 1998); ''United States v. Wood'', 106 F.3d 942, 248 (10th Cir. 1997); ''United States v. Tapia'', 912 F.2d 1367, 1370 (11th Cir. 1990).  "... The term '[[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]' in the context of our time is commonly regarded as being synonymous with the privilege against self-incrimination". ''Quinn v. United States'', 349 U.S. 155, 163, 75 S. Ct. 668, 99 L. Ed. 964 (1955); ''accord In re Johnny V.'', 85 Cal. App. 3d 120, 149 Cal.Rptr. 180, 184, 188 (Cal. Ct. App. 1978) (holding that the statement "I'll take the fifth" was an assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege).

===See===
"See" indicates that the cited authority supports, but does not directly state, the proposition given. Used similarly to no signal, to indicate that the proposition follows from the cited authority. It may also be used to refer to a cited authority which supports the proposition. For example, before 1997 the IDEA was silent on the subject of private school reimbursement, but courts had granted such reimbursement as "appropriate" relief under principles of equity pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(C ). ''See Burlington'', 471 U.S. at 370, 105 S.Ct. 1996 ("[W]e are confident that by empowering the court to grant 'appropriate' relief Congress meant to include retroactive reimbursement to parents as an available remedy in a proper case."); 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(C ) ("In any action brought under this paragraph, the court ... shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate.").

===See also===
This indicates that the cited authority constitutes additional material which supports the proposition less directly than that indicated by "see" or "accord". "See also" may be used to introduce a case supporting the stated proposition which is distinguishable from previously-cited cases. It is sometimes used to refer readers to authorities supporting a proposition when other supporting authorities have already been cited or discussed. A parenthetical explanation of the source's relevance, after a citation introduced by "see also", is encouraged. For example, " ... Omitting the same mental element in a similar weapons possession statute, such as RCW 9.41.040, strongly indicates that the omission was purposeful and that strict liability was intended. ''See generally'' ''State v. Alvarez'', 74 Wash. App. 250, 260, 872 P.2d 1123 (1994) (omission of "course of conduct" language in criminal counterpart to civil antiharassment act indicated "Legislature consciously chose to criminalize a single act rather than a course of conduct.") aff'd, 128 Wash.2d 1, 904 P.2d 754 (1995); ''see also'' ''State v. Roberts'', 117 Wash.2d 576, 586, 817 P.2d 855 (1991) (use of certain statutory language in one instance, and different language in another, evinces different legislative intent) (citing cases)." Source: ''State v. Anderson'', 141 Wash.2d 357, 5 P.3d 1247, 1253 (2000).

===''Cf.''===
{{main|Cf.}}
From the [[Latin]] ''confer'' ("compare"), this signals that a cited proposition differs from the main proposition but is sufficiently analogous to lend support. An explanatory parenthetical note is recommended to clarify the citation's relevance. For example, it is precisely this kind of conjecture and hair-splitting that the [[U.S. Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] wanted to avoid when it fashioned the bright-line rule in [[Miranda warning|Miranda]]. ''Cf''. ''Davis'', 512 U.S. at 461 (noting that where the suspect asks for counsel, the benefit of the bright-line rule is the "clarity and ease of application" that "can be applied by officers in the real world without unduly hampering the gathering of information" by forcing them "to make difficult judgment calls" with a "threat of suppression if they guess wrong").

=={{anchor|Signals that indicate background material}}Signal indicating background material==

===See generally===
This signal indicates that the cited authority presents background material relevant to the proposition. Legal scholars generally encourage the use of parenthetical explanations of the source material's relevance following each authority using "see generally", and this signal can be used with primary and secondary sources. For example, it is a form of "discrimination" because the complainant is being subjected to differential treatment. ''See generally Olmstead v. L. C''., 527 U.S. 581, 614, 144 L. Ed. 2d 540, 119 S. Ct. 2176 (1999) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (the "normal definition of discrimination" is "differential treatment").

=={{anchor|Signals that indicate contradiction}}Signals indicating contradiction==

===''Contra''===
This signals that the cited authority directly [[Contradiction|contradicts]] a given point. ''Contra'' is used where no signal would be used for support. For example: "Before ''Blakely'', courts around the country had found that 'statutory minimum' was the maximum sentence allowed by law for the crime, rather than the maximum ''standard'' range sentence. ''See, e.g.,'' ''State v. Gore'', 143 Wash. 2d 288, 313-14, 21 P.3d 262 (2001), ''overruled by State v. Hughes'', 154 Wash. 2d 118, 110 P.3d 192 (2005). ''Contra Blakely'', 124 S. Ct. at 2536-37."

===But see===
The cited authority contradicts the stated proposition, directly or implicitly. "But see" is used in opposition where "see" is used for support. For example: "Specifically, under ''Roberts'', there may have been cases in which courts erroneously determined that testimonial statements were reliable. ''But see Bockting v. Bayer'', 418 F.3d at 1058 (O'Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc)."

===''But cf.''===
The cited authority contradicts the stated proposition by analogy; a parenthetical explanation of the source's relevance is recommended. For example: ''But cf.'' 995 F.2d, at 1137 (observing that “[i]n the ordinary tort claim arising when a government driver negligently runs into another car, jury trial is precisely what is lost to a plaintiff when the government is substituted for the employee”).

"But" should be omitted from "but see" and "but cf." when the signal follows another negative signal: ''Contra'' ''Blake v. Kiline'', 612 F.2d 718, 723-24 (3d Cir. 1979); ''see'' CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, LAW OF FEDERAL COURTS 48 (4th ed. 1983).

=={{anchor|Signals that indicate a useful comparison}}Signals indicating comparison==

==={{anchor|Compare _____ with _______}}Compare===
This signal compares two or more authorities who reach different outcomes for a stated proposition. Because the relevance of the comparison may not be readily apparent to the reader, ''The Bluebook'' recommends adding a parenthetical explanation after each authority. Either "compare" or "with" may be followed by more than one source, using "and" between each. Legal writers italicize "compare", "with" and "and". "Compare" is used with "with", with the "with" preceded by a comma. If "and" is used, it is also be preceded by a comma.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} For example: To characterize the first element as a "distortion", however, requires the concurrence to second-guess the way in which the state court resolved a plain conflict in the language of different statutes. ''Compare'' Fla. Stat. 102.166 (2001) (foreseeing manual recounts during the protest period), ''with'' 102.111 (setting what is arguably too short a deadline for manual recounts to be conducted); compare 102.112(1) (stating that the Secretary "may" ignore late returns), ''with'' 102.111(1) (stating that the Secretary "shall" ignore late returns).

=={{anchor|Using signals as verbs}}Signals as verbs==
In footnotes, signals may function as verbs in sentences; this allows material which would otherwise be included in a parenthetical explanation to be integrated. When used in this manner, signals should not be italicized. ''See'' Christina L. Anderson, Comment, ''Double Jeopardy:  The Modern Dilemma for Juvenile Justice'', 152 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1181, 1204-07 (2004) (discussing four main types of restorative justice programs) becomes: See Christina L. Anderson, Comment, ''Double Jeopardy: The Modern Dilemma for Juvenile Justice'', 152 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1181, 1204-07 (2004), for a discussion of restorative justice as a reasonable replacement for retributive sanctions. "''Cf.''" becomes "compare" and "''e.g.''" becomes "for example" when the signals are used as verbs.

=={{anchor|Signal formatting}}Formatting==

==={{anchor|Capitalizing Signals}}Capitalization===
The first letter of a signal should be capitalized when it begins a citation sentence. If it is in a citation clause or sentence, it should not be capitalized.

==={{anchor|Signal Placement and Typeface}}Placement and typeface===
One space should separate an introductory signal from the rest of the citation, with no punctuation between. For example, ''See'' ''American Trucking Associations v. United States EPA'', 195 F.3d 4 (D.C. Cir. 1999).

Do not italicize a signal used as a verb; for example, for a discussion of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s failure to interpret a statute to provide intelligible principles, see ''American Trucking Associations v. United States EPA,'' 195 F.3d 4 (D.C. Cir. 1999).

==={{anchor|Order of signals}}Order===
When one or more signals are used, the signals should appear in the following order:&lt;ref name="legalbluebook.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legalbluebook.com/|title=The Bluebook|work=legalbluebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Introductory signals
** No signal
** e.g.,
** Accord
** See
** See also
** Cf.
*Signals indicating comparison
** Compare
* Signals indicating contradiction
** Contra
** But see
** But cf.
* Signal indicating background material
** See generally

When multiple signals are used, they must be consistent with this order. Signals of the same basic type - supportive, comparative, contradictory or background - are strung together in a single citation sentence, separated by semicolons. Signals of different types should be grouped in different citation sentences. For example:

"''See'' ''Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia'', 427 U.S. 307 (1976) (''per curiam''); ''cf.'' Palmer v. Ticcione, 433 F.Supp. 653 (E.D.N.Y 1977) (upholding a mandatory retirement age for kindergarten teachers). ''But see'' Gault v. Garrison, 569 F.2d 993 (7th Cir. 1977) (holding that a classification of public school teachers based on age violated equal protection absent a showing of justifiable and rational state purpose). ''See generally'' Comment, ''O’Neill v. Baine'': ''Application of Middle-Level Scrutiny to Old-Age Classifications'', 127 U. Pa. L. Rev. 798 (1979) (advocating a new constitutional approach to old-age classifications)."

When ''e.g.'' is combined with another signal, the placement of the combined signal is determined by the non-''e.g.'' signal; the combined signal "''see, e.g.''" should be placed where the "''see''" signal would normally be. In a citation clause, citation strings may contain different types of signals; these signals are separated by semicolons.

==={{anchor|Order of authorities within each signal}}Order of authorities===
Authorities in a signal are separated by semicolons. If an authority is more helpful or authoritative than others cited in a signal, it should precede them. Otherwise, authorities are cited in the following order:
*Constitutions and other foundation documents
#Federal
#State (alphabetically by name)
#Foreign (alphabetically by jurisdiction)
#Foundation documents of the United Nations, the League of Nations and the European Union (in that order). Constitutions of the same jurisdiction are cited in reverse chronological order.
*Statutes
#Federal: Statutes in U.S.C., U.S.C.A., or U.S.C.S.; other statutes currently in force, by reverse chronological order of enactment; rules of evidence and procedure and repealed statutes (by reverse chronological order of enactment)
#State (alphabetically by state): Statutes in the current code, by order in the code; statutes in force but not in the current code, by order in the code; rules of evidence and procedure, and repealed statutes (by reverse chronological order of enactment)
#Foreign (alphabetically by jurisdiction): Codes or statutes in the current code, by order in the code; statutes in force but not in the current code, by reverse chronological order of enactment, and repealed statutes (by reverse chronological order of enactment)
#Treaties and other international agreements, other than the foundation documents of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[League of Nations]], and the [[European Union|EU]]): cite in reverse chronological order.
*Cases: Cases decided by the same court are arranged in reverse chronological order; all U.S. circuit courts of appeals are treated as one court, and all federal district courts are treated as one court. Cite cases in the following order, in the order of federal, state, foreign, and international:
#Federal:
##Supreme Court
##Court of Appeals, Emergency Court of Appeals and Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals
##Court of Claims, Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and bankruptcy appeals panels
##District courts, Judicial Panel on [[Multidistrict Litigation]] and Court of International Trade 
##District bankruptcy courts and the Railroad Reorganization Court
##Court of Federal Claims, Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and Tax Court
##Administrative agencies, alphabetically by agency
#State
##Courts, alphabetically by state and then by rank within each state
##Agencies, alphabetically by state and then alphabetically by agency within states
#Foreign
##Courts, alphabetically by jurisdiction and then by rank within each jurisdiction
##Agencies, alphabetically by jurisdiction and then alphabetically by agency within each jurisdiction
#International
##International Court of Justice, Permanent Court of International Justice
##Other international tribunals and arbitration panels, alphabetically by name
*Legislative materials: Cite in the following order: bills and resolutions, committee hearings, reports, documents, and committee prints, floor debates (in reverse chronological order)
*Administrative and executive materials: Cite in the following order: federal (Executive Orders, current Treasury Regulations, other regulations in force, proposed rules not in force, repealed materials), state (alphabetically by state) and foreign (alphabetically by jurisdiction)
*Resolutions, decisions, and regulations of intergovernmental organizations: Cite in the following order: [[United Nations|UN]] and [[League of Nations]] ([[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]], then [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], then other organs in alphabetical order) and other organizations (alphabetically by name of organization)
*Records, briefs, and petitions, cited in that order
*Secondary materials: Cite in the following order: uniform codes, model codes and restatements (in reverse chronological order by category); books and pamphlets, works in journals, book reviews not written by students, student-written law-review materials, annotations, magazine and newspaper articles, working papers, unpublished materials and electronic sources (including Internet sources). For all secondary sources except codes and restatements, cite alphabetically by last name of author; if none, by first word of title.
*Cross-references to the author's own material in text or footnotes; for example: See Arnold v. Runnels, 421 F.3d 859, 866 n. 8 (9th Cir.2005); ''United States v. Soliz'', 129 F.3d 499, 504 n. 3 (1997), overruled on other grounds by ''United States v. Johnson'', 256 F.3d 895 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (per curiam); ''Evans v. Demosthenes'', 98 F.3d 1174, 1176 (9th Cir.1996).&lt;ref name="legalbluebook.com"/&gt;

===Parenthetical information===
Parentheticals, as needed, explain the relevance of an authority to the proposition in the text. Parenthetical information is recommended when the relevance of a cited authority might not otherwise be clear to the reader. Explanatory information takes the form of a present-participle phrase, a quoted sentence or a short statement appropriate in context. Unlike the other signals, it immediately follows the full citation. Usually brief (about one sentence), it quickly explains how the citation supports or disagrees with the proposition. For example: ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', 347 U.S. 483 (1954) (overruling ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', 163 U.S. 537 (1896)).

==={{anchor|Phrases not quoting the authority}}Phrases not quoting an authority===
Explanatory parenthetical phrases not directly quoting the authority usually begin with a present participle and should not begin with a capital letter: ''See generally'' John Copeland Nagle &amp; J.B. Ruhl, ''The Law of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Management'' 227-45 (2002) (detailing the ESA's prohibition on the possession of protected species). When a complete participial phrase is unnecessary in context, a shorter parenthetical may be substituted:
Such standards have been adopted to address a variety of environmental problems. ''See, e.g.'', H.B. Jacobini, ''The New International Sanitary Regulations'', 46 Am. J. INT'L L. 727, 727-28(1952) (health-related water quality); Robert L. Meyer, Travaux Preparatoires ''for the UNESCO World Heritage Convention'', 2 EARTH L.J. 45, 45-81 (1976)(conservation of protected areas).

==={{anchor|How do I determine whether my argument needs a parenthetical?|Phrases quoting the authority}}Phrases quoting an authority===
If the parenthetical quotes one or more full sentences, it begins with a capital letter and end with punctuation: ''See'' Committee Note to Interim Rule 8001(f) ("Given the short time limit to file the petition with the circuit clerk, subdivision (f)(1) provides that entry of a certification on the docket does not occur until an effective appeal is taken under Rule 8003(a) or (b)."). Insert a space before the opening parenthesis of the explanatory parenthetical. If the parenthetical does not contain a complete sentence, the writer should not place final punctuation (such as a period) inside it.

Place a parenthetical included as part of a citation before an explanatory parenthetical:
Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(1) (emphasis added) (also indicating that "[a] party may instruct a deponent not to answer ... when necessary to preserve a privilege"). Shorter parenthetical phrases may be used if a complete participial phrase is unnecessary in the context of the citation: The Florida Supreme court recently declared that “where the seller of a home knows facts materially affecting the value of the property which are not readily observable and are not known to the buyer, the seller is under a duty to disclose them to the buyer.” ''Johnson v. Davis'', 480 So. 2d 625, 629 (Fla. 1985) (defective roof in three-year-old home). If a source directly quotes or supports an argument (no signal or "see" before a citation), no parenthetical is necessary.

==={{anchor|Order Within a Citation|Be careful of...}}Order in a citation===
If a cited case has subsequent history or other relevant authority, it follows the parenthetical: ''Anderson v. Terhune'', 467 F.3d 1208 (9th Cir.2006) (claiming that a police officer's continued questioning violated due process rights), ''reh'g en banc granted'', 486 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir.2007).

==={{anchor|Supra|Infra|Compare ALWD 10 (3d) and Bluebook 3.5 (18th)}}Internal cross-references===
Portions of text, footnotes, and groups of authorities within the piece are cited with ''supra'' or ''infra''. ''Supra'' refers to material already in the piece, and ''infra'' to material appearing later in the piece. "Note" and "Part" refer to footnotes and parts (when parts are specifically designed) in the same piece; "p." and "pp." are used to refer to other pages in the same piece.&lt;ref name="legalbluebook.com"/&gt; These abbreviations should be used sparingly to avoid repeating a lengthy footnote or to cross-reference a nearby footnote.

'''Countercurrent''' ({{lang-it|Controcorrente}}) is a small, Italian, [[trotskyism|trotskyist]] political party. It used to be a faction within the [[Communist Refoundation Party]].

The group emerged in 2006 as a split from [[Communist Project]], when their leader [[Marco Ferrando]] decided to leave the party in order to form his own [[Workers' Communist Party (Italy)|Workers' Communist Party]]. For the 24–27 July 2008 congress the faction formed a common list with [[The Ernesto]], another minority faction, and obtained 7.7% of the delegates. In that occasion they supported the election of [[Paolo Ferrero]], leader of the [[Refoundation in Movement]]-[[Being Communists]] motion, as party secretary, thus joining for the first time the majority of the party.

In 2010 the faction embraced the [[Committee for a Workers' International]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialistworld.net/doc/4285&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the party was the most important promoter of the massive Genoa Public Transportation Strike, that went on for a week and was considered the biggest non-general strike of the year.

In 2017, Controcorrente left the CWI over disagreements regarding, among other issues, the role of the European Union and [[Brexit]]. A large minority including mostly younger members split from Controcorrente to remain part of the CWI, forming a new organisation named [[Resistenze Internazionali]].&lt;ref&gt;https://resistenzeinternazionali.it/2017/08/un-inizio-cwi-cil-italia/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tribunal de Cuentas''' ('''Court of Auditors''') is the supreme [[governmental accounting]] body of [[Spain]] responsible of the comptrolling of the public accounts and the auditing of the accountancy of the political parties, in accordance with the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|Constitution]] and its [[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Law]].

The Court of Auditors is composed by the President and 12 counsellors. The Counsellors are appointed by the [[Cortes Generales]], six of them by the [[Congress of Deputies|Congress]] and the other six by the [[Senate of Spain|Senate]]. To be appointed Counsellor of the Court it is needed to be a person with knowledge in audit, judge, prosecutor, university teacher or a public servant in an office that requieres superior studies, lawyer, economist or trade profesor, all of them with recognized experience and with fifteen years of professional activity. The Court Account Counselors are independent and irremovable.

==History==
The very first origins of the Court they go back to the Reign of [[John II of Castile]]. [[Álvaro de Luna]], [[Constable of Castile]], advise the King to approve a royal order to make easy the tax collection due to the difficulties in the collection of taxes and in the ordering of the accounts. This royal order is approved in July 2, 1437 which regulated the Senior Accountants, a group of civil servants in charge of resolve economic conflicts and to reclame the money that was not paid in time.

During the reign of [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]], new ordinances were granted on January 9, 1478, to put an end to the backlog of outstanding accounts since 1454, in the [[Crown of Castile]]. The Accountancy has the exclusive and absolute authority to claim, censor and fail all the accounts of the public officials that handle flows and effects. The Senior Accountants are given the responsibility of reviewing them, those taken and completed, as well as determining and judging the scope of accounts. They are also authorized to proceed against any person or Council, and allow them to act on behalf of the Kings.

In the last years of the reign of [[King Charles I of Spain|King Charles I]], on July 10, 1554, new royal orders were granted in Valladolid for the Senior Accountants. They increase the number of accountants and the amount of the Room's right (it was a duty of the citizents of give a room to the King's servants during their stay in town). It is also the first time that it is included in a judicial process of accounts, when accounts considered extraordinary, or with some amendment, the obligation to take an oath to the people who have had them in charge, about the veracity of the confused data.

In the reign of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], the Senior Accountants are helped by lawyers that advise them and the Treasury Council is created. In 1593, a new reform in the accounting system provokes that the King's Council lose its powers in accounting and these are given to the Council of the Treasury and incompatibilities are created for the Senior Accountants, that cannot have another job at the same time.

In 1605 were created the Court of Auditors of the Indies in [[Mexico]], [[Bogotá]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] to control the accounts of the spanish territories in Americas.

The [[Constitution of 1812]], passed by the Cortes of Cadiz, provided for the creation of an Accounting Office"to examine all accounts of public funds". In 1828, the ordinance establishing the Highest Court of Auditors was approved, which was in force until 1851.  In 1828, the ordinance establishing the Highest Court of Auditors was approved, which was in force until 1851.

During the regime established in the Constitution of 1845, a series of major reforms were carried out in the financial administration of the State and the Organic Act of the Court of Auditors, 1851 was approved, which is the seed of the current institution, with responsibility for the financial control of Public Administration.

In 1870, a new Law on Organization of the Court of Auditors of the Kingdom was approved and was in force until the Supreme Court of the Treasury was established in 1924, which integrated both external and internal control functions of the public sector.

The Court of Auditors of the Republic was established in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|Constitution of 1931]] as the supreme audit body of the economic and management in the public sector and its Organic Act was approved in 1934.

Rules for adapting the institution to the political regime in force became established later. A Law on Organization, Functions and Procedures of the Court of Auditors of the Kingdom was approved in 1953, amended in 1961, in which the Court of Auditors was defined as the supreme external audit body of the State, with the function of reporting to the Head of State and the courts of the result of its audit activity and the recognition of a genuine judicial function.

The current Court of Auditors is configured at present by the [[Spanish constitution of 1978|Constitution of 1978]] as the supreme audit body of the economic and management in the public sector, which is independent from the executive power and is directly linked to the Spanish Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.tcu.es/export/sites/default/.content/pdf/LA-INSTITUCION-Y-SUS-ANTECEDENTES.pdf|title=The Institution and its background|last=|first=|publisher=Tribunal de Cuentas|year=|isbn=|location=Spain|pages=2-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9929">'''Deepan Budlakoti''' is an Ottawa-born man best known for Canada's refusal to acknowledge him as a citizen.&lt;ref name=cbc /&gt; His case, supported by numerous human rights organizations and a broad mobilization of public support, was heard by several Canadian courts, and has captured domestic and international attention. Since Budlakoti does not hold any citizenship,&lt;ref&gt;Globe and Mail, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/editorials/a-wrongful-deportation/article6605773/ "Editorial"], 20 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; his case raises questions of citizenship, statelessness, and deportation.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Civil Liberties Association [http://ccla.org/2014/03/14/ccla-presents-deepan-budlakoti-statelessness-citizenship/ "Deepan Budlakoti, Statelessness &amp; Citizenship"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Budlakoti was born on October 17, 1989 in [[Ottawa]], Ontario, to Indian nationals who had been employed at the Indian High Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/73390/index.do ''Budlakoti v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)''], 2014 FC 855, para 2, 17, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ccla.org/ccla-calls-for-recognition-of-deepan-budlakotis-citizenship/|title=CCLA calls for recognition of Deepan Budlakoti's citizenship|website=Canadian Civil Liberties Association|date=27 February 2015|access-date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 3(2) of the ''Citizenship Act'' states that children of diplomats and their staff, when born in Canada, are not entitled to Canadian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-29/page-2.html#docCont "Citizenship Act"].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Canada]] alleged that at the time of Budlakoti's birth, his parents were working as cleaning staff at the High Commission;&lt;ref&gt;Koring, Paul, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/would-be-deportee-pleads-im-a-canadian/article4255287/ "Would-be deportee pleads: 'I'm a Canadian'"], Globe and Mail, 23 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Budlakoti contended that his parents had left that job several months prior.&lt;ref&gt;2014 FC 855, para 20.&lt;/ref&gt; After his birth, Budlakoti was issued an Ontario birth certificate, and subsequently two Canadian passports.&lt;ref&gt;2014 FC 855, para 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/stateless-ottawa-born-man-loses-bid-for-citizenship|title='Stateless' Ottawa-born man loses bid for citizenship|website=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|last=Duffy|first=Andrew|date=10 September 2014|access-date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Budlakoti's parents applied for [[Permanent residency in Canada|permanent residency]], listing Budlakoti as a dependent. The application was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://decisions.fca-caf.gc.ca/fca-caf/decisions/en/109963/1/document.do ''Budlakoti v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)''], 2015 FCA 139, para 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010, Budlakoti was convicted for weapons trafficking, firearm possession and cocaine trafficking, and sentenced to three years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;2014 FC 855, para 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc /&gt; The Justice for Deepan Support Committee, which works with Budlakoti to raise awareness about the case, raise money for escalating legal fees, and put political pressure on elected officials to reverse the decision,&lt;ref name=deepan&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice for Deepan|website=Justice for Deepan|url=http://www.justicefordeepan.org|access-date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; contends that Budlakoti was [[Entrapment|entrapped]] by an undercover police officer, and that Budlakoti pleaded guilty due to the high [[Attorney's fee|legal fees]].&lt;ref name=deepan /&gt;

While Budlakoti was in prison, [[Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|Citizenship and Immigration Canada]] determined that he was not and had never been a Canadian citizen, and thus was inadmissible to Canada on the basis of section 36(1) of the ''[[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act]]'',&lt;ref name=cbc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2014 FC 855, para 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and issued a removal order accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;2014 FC 855, para 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Budlakoti was released in 2012 while awaiting judicial review of the [[Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada]]'s decision. As a result, Budlakoti lost all other corresponding Canadian identification, leaving him unable to work, access health care, exercise the full extent of his mobility rights, and live alone.&lt;ref&gt;Bozinoff, Nikki, Ritika Goel, Marcella Jones, and Faraz Vahid Shahid, [http://rabble.ca/news/2015/03/canada-made-deepan-budlakoti-stateless-now-it-denying-him-health-care "Canada made Deepan Budlakoti stateless, Now it is denying him health care"], Rabble, 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==At trial==

In June 2014, Budlakoti's case was heard before the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]]. Budlakoti argued that his [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7]] ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]]'' rights to life, liberty, and security of the person were violated. In the fall of 2014, the Federal Court dismissed Budlakoti's application for [[judicial review]], holding that "[t]he fact that passports were issued to the Applicant is not, in this case, determinative of citizenship".&lt;ref&gt;2014 FC 855, para 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that issuing a declaration of citizenship would fall outside the court's authority.&lt;ref&gt;2014 FC 855 at 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The court dismissed Budlakoti's section 7 ''Charter'' argument, finding that "denial of citizenship is not synonymous with deportation",&lt;ref&gt;2014 FC 855, para 46.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the denial of state funded health care does not violate s 7", per ''[[Chaoulli v Quebec (AG)]]''.&lt;ref&gt;2014 FC 855, para 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Budlakoti appealed to the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]], where the appeal was dismissed. The court held that Budlakoti was not stateless, per the ''[[Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness]]'', since he could still "take steps to apply for citizenship in India and in Canada"&lt;ref&gt;2015 FCA 139, paras 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; through the general citizenship application process, or by invoking the "special and unusual hardship" rule in the ''Citizenship Act''.&lt;ref&gt;2015 FCA 149, paras 52–54&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that he had not yet availed himself of either of these procedures in Canada or in India.&lt;ref&gt;2015 FCA 139, paras 55, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Budlakoti argued that then-[[Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|Minister of Citizenship]] [[Chris Alexander (politician)|Chris Alexander]] was biased, as a spokesperson for Alexander had previously denounced Budlakoti as a "criminal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keung|first1=Nicholas|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/09/18/canadianborn_man_faces_deportation.html|title=Canadian-born man faces deportation|website=[[Toronto Star]]|date=18 September 2013|access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court rejected this argument, finding that if Budlakoti applied under the "special and unusual hardship" rule, the hardship would be "determinative... [and] neither the Minister nor his officials have commented on that issue".&lt;ref&gt;2015 FCA 139, para 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

A request for leave for appeal to the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] was denied in January 2016.&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/deepan-budlakoti-supreme-court-case-dismissed-1.3423725|title=Deepan Budlakoti's appeal to be declared Canadian citizen dismissed by Supreme Court|website=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=28 January 2016|access-date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/news/en/item/5156/index.do|title=Judgments in Leave Applications|date=28 January 2016|website=[[LexUM]]|access-date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==

This case is unique and has attracted international attention. [[Amnesty International]] has condemned the Canadian government's actions,&lt;ref name=amnesty&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesty.ca/blog/nationality-statelessness-and-the-case-of-deepan-budlakoti|last1=Neve|first1=Alex|website=[[Amnesty International]]|title=Nationality, Statelessness and the Case of Deepan Budlakoti|date=9 March 2015|access-date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that as a signatory to the [[United Nations]] ''[[Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness]]'',&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, [https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=V-4&amp;chapter=5&amp;lang=en "Signatories to the International Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325153730/https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=V-4&amp;chapter=5&amp;lang=en |date=March 25, 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Canada should "act to reduce statelessness and uphold the right to a nationality".&lt;ref name=amnesty /&gt;

==Criminal Activity==

On November 8, 2017, charges were announced against Deepan Budlakoti, following a police operation called Project Landslide: A total of 83 counts of gun trafficking, possessing the proceeds of crime and breaching a gun ban. The results of the investigation by the [[Ontario Provincial Police]]’s organized crime enforcement bureau and Ottawa and Gatineau police were announced Wednesday. The guns seized included an AR-15 rifle, SKS semi-automatic rifle with a bayonet, an Uzi submachine-gun, half a dozen handguns and ammunition.

The drugs included  156,000 methamphetamine pills packed into pillow-sized clear plastic bags. Other items seized included a studded wooden club, a swastika-emblazoned butterfly knife and brass knuckles.&lt;ref&gt;http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/seven-month-gun-drug-running-probe-nets-man-in-high-profile-fight-for-citizenship&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Digital Copyright: Protecting Intellectual Property on the Internet''''' is a 2000 book by [[Jessica Litman]] detailing the legislative struggles over the passage of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]].  It was widely reviewed and is generally cited as the definitive history of the DMCA's passage, as well as an exemplar of the lobbying and jockeying around passage of contemporary copyright legislation.&lt;ref&gt;"In her classic text...", [[Matthew Rimmer]], ''Digital Copyright and the Consumer Revolution: Hands Off My iPod'' (2007), p.9 (introduction).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Coyle]] noted that 

&lt;blockquote&gt;this is not a law book, although it is about law. ''Digital Copyright'' is instead a social history of copyright law. It is not about the law per se but about how the technology developments of the 20th century changed how copyright law is crafted in the United States and who reaps the benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Coyle]], [http://www.kcoyle.net/litman.html "Book Review: ''Digital Copyright: Protecting Intellectual Property on the Internet''"], ''Information Technology &amp; Libraries'', Dec. 2001, pp.220-222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The publisher, [[Prometheus Books]], described the book in its blurb: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1998, copyright lobbyists succeeded in persuading Congress to enact laws greatly expanding copyright owners' control over the private uses of their works by individuals. The efforts to enforce these new rights have resulted in highly publicized legal battles between established media, including major record labels and motion picture studios, and upstart Internet companies such as MP3.com and Napster. The general public is used to thinking of copyright (if it thinks of it at all) as magical and arcane, and it hasn't paid much attention as legislation to expand copyright moved through Congress. But copyright law is central to our society's information policy, and affects what we can read, view, hear, use, or learn.  In this enlightening and well-argued book, law professor Jessica Litman questions whether copyright laws crafted by lawyers and their lobbyists really make sense for the vast majority of us. Should every interaction between ordinary consumers and copyright-protected works be governed by laws drafted without ordinary consumers in mind? Is it practical to enforce such laws, or to expect consumers to obey them? Most important, what are the effects of such laws on the exchange of information in a free society?  Litman's critique exposes the 1998 copyright law as incoherent. She argues for commonsense reforms that reflect the way people actually behave in their daily digital interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Prometheus Books blurb, ''Digital Copyright'', 2001 hardback edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book includes an initial chapter on American copyright law (Chapter 1: "Copyright Basics"), and then the next several chapters focus on the legislative processes in US copyright law.  Joseph Fogel, reviewing the book, wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Litman's chapter on twentieth-century copyright law is wonderful. She criticizes negotiated copyright statutes as being unworkable. Congress, she recounts, relied upon private 'experts' to write copyright bills because the issues seemed to be the province of a very narrow slice of citizenry and thus not worthy of much of an elected official's time.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph S. Fogel, [http://www.lacba.org/Files/LAL/Vol24No9/958.pdf Review of ''Digital Copyright''], ''Los Angeles Lawyer'', v.24, n.9 (Dec. 2001), pp. 44-46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beginning with chapter 10, Litman examines the aftermath of the enactment of the [[DMCA]].  Chapter 10, "The Copyright Wars", considers the use of [[digital rights management]] in the motion picture and music industries, including [[DeCSS]] on DVDs, and the lack of widespread adoption of a similar technology on music CDs.  Litman reviews ''[[Universal City Studios v. Reimerdes]]'' and related cases, and for the music industry, ''[[UMG Recordings v. MP3.com]]'', ''[[A&amp;M Records v. Napster, Inc.]]'', and ''[[Recording Industry Association v. Diamond Multimedia]]''.  Comparing the industries' strategies, Litman notes, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;By engaging in a scorched-earth campaign, the recording industry squandered some truly awesome assets.  ... [It] ... was unwilling to commit itself to an insecure digital standard that might become entrenched. Instead, it fought about whose patented security algorithm would become the new standard, and it focused on herding all MP3 music off the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Litman, Chapter 10, p.156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Chapter 11 continues this analysis, with some reflections on the relative value of litigation versus legislation as strategies for the content industries.

In Chapter 12, "Revising Copyright Law for the Digital Age", Litman reviews the overall approach to developing copyright laws, concluding that "If we are to devise a copyright law that meets the public's needs, we might most profitably abandon the copyright law's traditional reliance on reproduction, and refashion our measure of unlawful use to better incorporate the public's understanding of the copyright bargain."&lt;ref&gt;Litman, Chapter 12, p.186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2006 edition, Litman included an updated foreword, which discussed in greater detail the [[peer-to-peer]] litigations that arose after the [[DMCA]]'s enactment.

'''EZproxy''' is a web [[proxy server]] used by [[library|libraries]] to give access from outside the library's [[computer network]] to restricted-access [[website]]s that [[authentication|authenticate]] users by [[IP address]]. This allows library patrons at home or elsewhere to log in through their library's EZproxy server and gain access to [[bibliographic database]]s and the like to which their library [[subscription business model|subscribes]].

The software was originally written by Chris Zagar in 1999 who founded Useful Utilities LLC to support it. [[OCLC]] announced in January 2008 that it had acquired the product and was hiring Zagar as a full-time consultant for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcat.org/arcviewer/2/OCC/2010/05/07/H1273247173434/viewer/file21.htm|title=OCLC acquires EZproxy authentication and access software|website=Worldcat.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zagar is a librarian who serves as a systems librarian at the [[Estrella Mountain Community College]], a part of the [[Maricopa County Community College District|Maricopa Community Colleges]] in [[Arizona]].

The software is sometimes confused with generic proxy server software designed to control web access. It is sometimes referred to as a "proxy referral" server to distinguish it.

The software has been purchased by more than 2,500 institutions in over 60 countries.&lt;ref name=ezproxyhome&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oclc.org/en/ezproxy.html/|title=EZproxy|website=Oclc.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Emergency Federal Register''''' is the planned replacement for the ''[[Federal Register]]'', the [[official journal]] of the [[United States government]], in the event publication of the ''Federal Register'' is suspended by presidential decree following the onset of a severe national calamity, such as a major nuclear attack or the [[mainland invasion of the United States]].&lt;ref name="usc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zuck"/&gt; According to the [[Office of the Federal Register]], the ''Emergency Federal Register'' "can only be activated under extreme national security conditions".&lt;ref name="usc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="drafting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Register Document Drafting Handbook|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/write/handbook/appendix-e.pdf|website=archives.gov|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication in the ''Federal Register'' of newly enacted federal regulations is required prior to their effective date. The purpose of the ''Emergency Federal Register'' would be to permit the continuation of such required publication but from a location outside of [[Washington, DC]], in the event that city were overrun or rendered uninhabitable, or by methods or means other than bound paper, possibly including broadcast transmission or a [[town crier]] system.&lt;ref name="zuck"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Edward|title=The Day After World War III|date=1984|publisher=Viking|isbn=0670258806|pages=236–237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="drafting"/&gt; The Office of the Federal Register maintains alternate work sites where the ''Emergency Federal Register'' can be managed, including one site in [[Laurel, Maryland]], another site in [[Rocket Center, West Virginia]], and at least one other "classified location".&lt;ref name="drafting"/&gt;

Authority for activation of an alternative to the ''Federal Register'' is contained in Title 44, Section 1505 of the [[United States Code]], which specifies that:&lt;ref name="usc"&gt;{{cite web|title=44 U.S. Code § 1505 – Documents to be published in Federal Register|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/1505|website=cornell.edu|publisher=[[Government Printing Office]]|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the event of an attack or threatened attack upon the continental United States and a determination by the President that as a result of an attack or threatened attack publication of the Federal Register or filing of documents with the Office of the Federal Register is impracticable, or under existing conditions publication in the Federal Register would not serve to give appropriate notice to the public of the contents of documents, the President may, without regard to any other provision of law, suspend all or part of the requirements of law or regulation for filing with the Office or publication in the Federal Register of documents or classes of documents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many new regulations required in a crisis situation, however, would not require advance publication. A contingency regulatory code, operating in parallel to the ''[[Code of Federal Regulations]]'' and known as the ''Emergency Code of Federal Regulations'', can be immediately promulgated following the onset of an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Research Guide to the Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations|url=http://www.llsdc.org/fr-cfr-research-guide|website=llsdc.org|publisher=Law Librarians' Society of Washington|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ferguson v. City of Charleston''''', {{ussc|532|67|2001}}, is a [[United States Supreme Court]] decision that found [[Medical University of South Carolina]]'s policy regarding involuntary drug testing of pregnant women to violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. The Court held that the search in question was unreasonable.

==Facts==
In the fall of 1988, staff at a hospital operated by the Medical University of South Carolina became concerned about the prevalence of so-called "[[crack baby|crack babies]]," as well as an increase in cocaine use among pregnant women receiving prenatal treatment at the hospital.  In the spring of 1989, hospital staff began conducting urine screens on pregnant women, and referring the women who tested positive for counseling.  Soon after the urine screenings began, the case manager in the hospital's obstetrics department heard that police in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], were arresting pregnant women who used cocaine for child abuse.  The theory behind the arrests was that the women's cocaine use was harmful to the fetuses.  After reviewing the idea with counsel, the MUSC hospital began referring pregnant women who tested positive for cocaine to [[City of Charleston Police Department|Charleston police]] for prosecution.

Acting together, hospital staff and the police department developed a written policy for determining which pregnant women would be screened and, if they tested positive, prosecuted.  Women would be selected for urine screening if they met certain criteria, such as prior lack of prenatal care, known history of drug or alcohol abuse, intrauterine fetal death, or [[abruptio placentae]].  If the women tested positive, they were referred to substance abuse counseling and threatened with prosecution.  The hospital staff acknowledged that the "threat of law enforcement intervention... provided the necessary leverage to make the policy effective."  Women who tested positive a second time were arrested, even before giving birth.  If the positive test occurred prior to the 28th week of pregnancy, the woman would be charged with simple possession.  If she tested positive in the 28th week or later, she would be charged with possession and distribution to a person under age 18&amp;mdash;to wit, the fetus.  If she delivered the baby "while testing positive for illegal drugs," the woman would also be charged with unlawful neglect of a child.

Thirty pregnant women who had been arrested pursuant to the policy brought suit in federal court, challenging the MUSC policy of conducting warrantless, nonconsensual drug testing as violating their [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.  The hospital and the city raised two primary defenses&amp;mdash;first, that the women had consented to the searches; and second, that even if they had not consented, the searches were reasonable as a matter of law because they were justified by "special non-law-enforcement purposes."  The district court rejected the second defense because it concluded that the searches were conducted for law enforcement purposes.  It submitted the first defense to the jury, instructing the jury that if the jury found that the women had consented, the jury should rule for the city and the hospital.  The jury found that the women had consented, and thus ruled for the city and the hospital.  The women appealed.

On appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth Circuit]] affirmed, but on the ground that the searches were justified as a matter of law by special non-law-enforcement needs.  It reasoned that the interest in curtailing pregnancy complications and reducing the medical costs associated with maternal cocaine use outweighed what it characterized as a "minimal intrusion" on the women's privacy.  The Supreme Court then agreed to hear the case.

==Majority opinion==
MUSC is a state-operated hospital, so its employees are government actors subject to the Fourth Amendment.  And a drug screen is a "search" covered by the Fourth Amendment.  Because the Fourth Circuit had ruled only on the special needs claim, the Court assumed that the women had not consented to the drug screens.  It then concluded that the special needs doctrine did not permit MUSC to conduct the drug screens according to its policy.

The fact that the women neither knew of nor consented to the drug screens made this case different from the other cases in which the Court had applied the special needs doctrine.  In ''[[Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association]]'', ''[[National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab]]'', and ''[[Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton]]'', the Court had sustained drug testing under the special needs doctrine in light of the subjects' consent; in ''[[Chandler v. Miller]]'', the Court had struck down drug testing under the special needs doctrine despite the subjects' consent.  In all four of those cases, the fact that the subjects consented lessened the invasion on the subjects' privacy.

In this case, by contrast, the extent of the invasion on the women's privacy was far greater.  "The reasonable expectation of privacy enjoyed by the typical patient undergoing diagnostic tests in a hospital is that the results of those tests will not be shared with nonmedical personnel without her consent."  By turning over the results of these medical tests to the police without the women's consent, MUSC violated this reasonable expectation of privacy.  In this case, unless the special needs doctrine applied, this intrusion upon the women's expectation of privacy would amount to a violation of the Fourth Amendment.

The Court did not simply take the city and the hospital at their word that their motivations were beneficent; rather, the Court examined all the evidence available to determine whether the special needs advanced were divorced from the generalized interest in law enforcement.  For example, in ''Railway Executives'', the need to discover the cause of railway accidents justified the drug testing, and in ''Acton'' it was the need to promote a drug-free school environment.  In this case, however, the very reason for the policy was to use the threat of arrest to motivate the women to abstain from using cocaine.  This fact was evident from the fact that police and prosecutors assisted the hospital staff in developing specimen collection and chain-of-custody procedures, the nature of possible criminal charges to which the patients would be subject, and how the police would be notified and the arrests would be accomplished.  "While the ultimate goal of the program may well have been to get the women in question into substance abuse treatment and off of drugs, the immediate objective of the searches was to generate evidence ''for law enforcement purposes'' in order to reach that goal."  Because the MUSC plan used the threat of arrest as the means to accomplish its overall goal of inducing pregnant women to abstain from using cocaine, "this case simply does not fit within the closely guarded category of 'special needs.'"  The mere fact that the hospital may have had benevolent motives cannot justify departing from the protections of the Fourth Amendment, especially in light of the heavy involvement of law enforcement with the hospital's program.

'''[[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]]''' pointed out that all searches, by definition, would uncover evidence of crime, and this says nothing about the "special needs" the search might serve.  In this case, however, Kennedy agreed that "while the policy may well have served legitimate needs unrelated to law enforcement, it had as well a penal character with a far greater connection to law enforcement than other searches sustained under our special needs rationale."

==Dissenting opinion==
'''[[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]]''' reasoned that there was no "search" in this case because the hospital did not take the urine from the women without their consent.  Urine, a waste product, would ordinarily be abandoned by the person who produces it; anyone who came across it would be free to do with it what they will, just as with garbage found on the sidewalk.  There is no "search" in the case of garbage left on the sidewalk because its (former) owner no longer expresses any interest in keeping it private.  For a similar reason, there is no "search" involved in performing a urine screen because the women voluntarily provided it to the hospital&amp;mdash;and even if they had not, the women would have freely abandoned it anyway.

Scalia also reasoned that even if the women had been coerced into providing the urine samples, it was not the government that coerced them.  This was so, Scalia reasoned, even if these women had to provide the samples as a precondition of receiving their prenatal medical care.
Nothing was violated.

{{Basic Forms of government}}

A '''government in exile''' is a political group which claims to be a [[Sovereign state|country]] or [[Federated state|semi-sovereign state]]'s legitimate [[government]], but is unable to exercise legal power and instead resides in another state or foreign country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=government-in-exile |title=Princeton University WordNet |publisher=Wordnetweb.princeton.edu |accessdate=2012-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments in [[exile]] usually plan to one day return to their native country and regain formal power. A government in exile differs from a [[rump state]] in the sense that a rump state controls at least part of its former territory.&lt;ref&gt;Tir, J., 2005-02-22 "Keeping the Peace After Secessions: Territorial Conflicts Between Rump and Secessionist States" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Studies Association, Hilton Hawaiian Village, Honolulu, Hawaii Online &lt;.PDF&gt;. 2009-05-25 from [https://archive.is/20120721042748/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p72056_index.html allacademic.com]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, during [[World War I]], nearly all of [[Belgium]] was [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|occupied]] by [[German Empire|Germany]], but Belgium and its allies held on to a small slice in the country's west.  A government in exile, in contrast, has lost all its territory.

Exiled governments tend to occur during [[war]]time occupation, or in the aftermath of a [[civil war]], [[revolution]], or [[Coup d'état|military coup]]. For example, during German expansion in [[World War II]], some [[Europe]]an governments sought refuge in the [[United Kingdom]], rather than face destruction at the hands of [[Nazi Germany]]. A government in exile may also form from widespread belief in the illegitimacy of a ruling government. Due to the outbreak of the [[Syrian Civil War]] back in 2011, for instance, the [[National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces]] was formed by groups whose members sought to end the rule of the ruling [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Ba'ath Party]]. 

The effectiveness of a government in exile depends primarily on the amount of support it can receive, either from foreign governments or from the population of its own country. Some exiled governments come to develop into a formidable force, posing a serious challenge to the incumbent [[regime]] of the country, while others are maintained chiefly as a symbolic gesture.

The phenomenon of a government in exile predates the formal utilization of the term. In periods of [[Monarch|monarchical government]], exiled monarchs or dynasties sometimes set up exile courts—as the [[House of Stuart]] did when driven from their throne by [[Oliver Cromwell]] and again at the [[Glorious Revolution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corp|first1=Edward|title=A Court in Exile: The Stuarts in France, 1689-1718|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521108373|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see {{section link|James Francis Edward Stuart|Court in exile}}). The [[House of Bourbon]] would be another example because it continued to be recognized by other countries at the time as the legitimate government of France after it was overthrown by the populace during the [[French Revolution]]. This continued to last through the rule of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] from 1803-04 to 1815. With the spread of [[constitutional monarchy]], monarchical governments which were exiled started to include a [[prime minister]], such as the [[Dutch government-in-exile|Dutch government during World War II]] headed by [[Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy]].

==Activities==
[[International law]] recognizes that governments in exile may undertake many types of actions in the conduct of their daily affairs. These actions include:
* becoming a party to a bilateral or international [[treaty]]
* amending or revising its own [[constitution]]
* maintaining [[military forces]]
* retaining, or newly obtaining, [[diplomatic recognition]] from other states
* issuing [[Identity document|identity cards]]
* allowing the formation of new [[Political party|political parties]]
* holding [[election]]s

In cases where a host country holds a large [[expatriate]] population from a government in exile's home country, or an [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] population from that country, the government in exile might come to exercise some administrative functions within such a population. For example, the WWII [[Provisional Government of Free India]] had such authority among the [[Malaysian Indian|ethnically Indian]] population of [[British Malaya]], with the consent of the then [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] military authorities.

==Current governments in exile==
Governments in exile may have [[List of states with limited recognition|little or no recognition from other states]]. Some exiled governments have some characteristics in common with [[rump state]]s. Such disputed or partially in exile cases are noted in the tables below.

===Deposed governments of current states===
These governments in exile were created by [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] governments or rulers who continue to claim legitimate authority of the state they once controlled.

However, there are also some who do not accept that the sovereignty of Taiwan was legitimately returned to the Republic of China at the end of the war nor that the Republic of China is a government-in-exile. The current [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]]-ruled Republic of China government is inclined to this view.

===Deposed governments of current subnational territories===
These governments in exile claim legitimacy of autonomous territories of another state and have been created by deposed governments or rulers, who do not claim [[independence]] as a separate state.

===Exiled governments of non-self-governing or occupied territories===
These governments in exile are governments of [[Self-governance|non-self-governing]] or occupied territories. They claim legitimate authority over a territory they once controlled, or claim legitimacy of a [[Decolonization|post-decolonization]] authority. The claim may stem from an exiled group's election as a legitimate government.

The [[United Nations]] recognizes the [[right of self-determination]] for the population of these territories, including the possibility of establishing independent sovereign states.

From the [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence]] in 1988 in exile in [[Algiers]] by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], it has effectively functioned as the government in exile of the Palestinian State. In 1994, however the PLO established the [[Palestinian National Authority]] interim [[Palestinian territories|territorial]] administration as result of the [[Oslo Accords]] signed by the PLO, Israel, the United States, and [[Russia]]. Between 1994 and 2013, the PNA functioned as an autonomy, thus while the government was seated in the West Bank it was not sovereign. In 2013, Palestine was upgraded to a non-member state status in the UN.

All of the above created an ambiguous situation, in which there are two distinct entities: The Palestinian Authority, exercising a severely limited amount of control on the ground under the tutelage of an Israeli military occupation; and the State of Palestine, recognized by the United Nations and by numerous countries as a fully sovereign and independent state, but not able to exercise such sovereignty on the ground. Both are headed by the same person—as of February 2016, President [[Mahmud Abbas]]—but are judicially distinct. For example, a dissolution of The Palestinian Authority and resumption of full rule on the ground by Israel would not in itself affect the State of Palestine, which could continue to exist as a government-in-exile diplomatically recognized by the UN and by numerous countries.

===Exiled governments with ambiguous status===
These governments have ties to the area(s) they represent, but their claimed status and/or stated aims are sufficiently ambiguous that they could fit into other categories.{{original research inline|date=June 2018}}

| Proclaimed on February 27, 1976, following the Spanish withdrawal from what was until then [[Spanish Sahara]]. Not strictly a government in exile since it does control 20-25% of its claimed territory. Nevertheless, often referred to as such, especially since most day-to-day government business is conducted in the [[Tindouf Province|Tindouf]] [[refugee camp]]s in [[Algeria]], which house most of the Sahrawi exile community, rather then in the proclaimed [[temporary capital]] (first [[Bir Lehlou]], moved  to [[Tifariti]] in 2008).

|In the early stages of the [[Thirty Years' War]],  [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria]], occupied the [[Electoral Palatinate]] and was awarded possession of it by the Emperor.

This Palatinate Council was headed by [[Ludwig Camerarius]], replaced in 1627 by [[Johann Joachim Rusdorf]]. Frederick himself died in exile, but his son and heir [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine|Charles Louis]] was able to regain the Lower Palatinate following the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648.

===Sovereign Military Order of Malta===
The [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] may be considered a case of a government in exile, since it is without territory but recognised as a sovereign government by numerous sovereign countries. However, it does not claim to be a sovereign state, rather a "sovereign subject" of international law. In addition, it no longer claims [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|jurisdiction over Malta]], and recognises and maintains diplomatic relations with the independent [[Republic of Malta]].

===World War II===
Many countries established a government in exile after loss of [[sovereignty]] in connection with [[World War II]].

====Governments in London====
A large number of European governments-in-exile were set up in London.
{{Governments in exile}}

Other exiled leaders in Britain in this time included [[King Zog of Albania]] and [[Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia]].

====The Danish exception====
The [[Occupation of Denmark]] (9 April 1940) was administered mainly by the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|German Foreign Office]], contrary to other occupied lands that were under [[Military Administration (Nazi Germany)|military]] or [[Reichskommissariat|civilian administration]]. [[Denmark]] did not establish a government in exile, although there was an Association of Free Danes established in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Who's who of the Allied Governments and Allied Trade &amp; Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBbUAAAAMAAJ|year=1944|publisher=Allied Publications|page=173}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Durham Divine|title=Navies in Exile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UJg-AAAAIAAJ|year=1944|publisher=E.P.

(See [[British occupation of the Faroe Islands]], [[Iceland during World War II]], and [[History of Greenland during World War II]].)

====Governments-in-exile in Asia====
The [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippine Commonwealth]] (invaded 9 December 1941) established a government in exile in Australia and the United States.

While formed long before World War II, the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]] continued in exile in China until the end of the war.

At the fall of Java, and the surrender by the Dutch on behalf of Allied forces on 8 March 1942, many Dutch-Indies officials (including [[Hubertus van Mook|Dr van Mook]]  and [[Charles van der Plas|Dr Charles van der Plas]]) managed to flee to Australia in March 1942, and on 23 December 1943, the Royal Government (Dutch) decreed an official '''Netherlands East Indies Government-in-exile''', with Dr van Mook as Acting Governor General, on Australian soil until Dutch rule was restored in the Indies.&lt;ref name=ba&gt;Lockwood, R.

====Axis-aligned "governments-in-exile"====
Under the auspices of the Axis powers, Axis-aligned groups from some countries set up "governments-in-exile" in Axis territory, even though internationally recognized governments remained in place in their home countries.

===Persian Gulf War===
Following the [[Ba'athist Iraq]]i [[Invasion of Kuwait|invasion]] and [[Kuwait Governorate|occupation]] of [[Kuwait]], during the [[Persian Gulf War]], on August 2, 1990, [[Sheikh]] [[Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah]] and senior members of his government fled to [[Saudi Arabia]], where they set up a [[Kuwaiti Government in exile|government-in-exile]] in [[Ta'if]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-08-24/news/9008240543_1_saad-kuwait-government-in-exile&lt;/ref&gt; The Kuwaiti government in exile was far more affluent than most other such governments, having full disposal of the very considerable Kuwaiti assets in western banks—of which it made use to conduct a massive [[propaganda]] campaign denouncing the Ba'athist Iraqi occupation and mobilizing public opinion in the western hemisphere in favor of war with [[Ba'athist Iraq]]. In March 1991, following the defeat of Ba'athist Iraq at the hands of coalition forces in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], the Sheikh and his government were able to return to Kuwait.

===Municipal Councils in Exile===

Following the [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 and the displacement of many [[Greek Cypriot]]s from [[North Cyprus]], displaced inhabitants of several towns set up what are in effect Municipal Councils in Exile, headed by Mayors in Exile. The idea is the same as with a national Government in Exile – to assert a continuation of legitimate rule, even though having no control of the ground, and working towards restoration of such control. Meetings of the exiled [[Lapithos#Former municipality|Municipal Council of Lapithos]] took place in the homes of its members until the Exile Municipality was offered temporary offices at 37 Ammochostou Street, Nicosia. The current Exile Mayor of the town is Athos Eleftheriou. The same premises are shared with the Exile Municipal Council of [[Kythrea]].

Also in the [[Famagusta District]] of Cyprus, the administration of the part retained by the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] considers itself as a "District administration in exile", since the district's capital [[Famagusta]] had been under Turkish control since 1974.

{{Tort law}}

A '''guest statute''' is a term used in the [[law]] of [[torts]] to describe a [[statute]] that makes it significantly more difficult for a [[passenger]] in an [[automobile]] to recover damages from the driver for injuries received in an accident resulting from ordinary negligence on the part of the driver.  Instead, passengers are limited to suits based on [[gross negligence]], recklessness, or intentional misconduct.  The statute may also place a cap on the damages to be awarded, or limit damages to compensation for actual physical injuries.

The original purpose of the guest statute was both to protect drivers from [[frivolous litigation]] and to protect [[insurance companies]] from [[collusive lawsuit|collusive and fraudulent suits]] (wherein the passenger sues the driver in order to collect from the driver's insurer).  For the same reason, some states also passed aviation guest statutes, which limit the liability of non-commercial airplane passengers. Many guest statutes now appear to have been abolished.&lt;ref&gt;Ala. Stat. Sec. 32-1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Nebraska's guest statute was repealed in 2010 following a court case upholding its constitutionality.&lt;ref&gt;Neb. Rev. Stat. Sec. 25-21,237&lt;/ref&gt;  Oregon maintains a guest statute applicable to non-paying passengers in aircraft or watercraft limiting claims for injury, death or loss in case of an accident, unless the accident was intentional on the part of the owner or operator or caused by the gross negligence or intoxication of the owner or operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/30.115|title=ORS § 30.115|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''South African nationality''' has been influenced primarily by the racial dynamics that have structured [[South Africa]]n society throughout its development.  The country's colonial history led to the immigration (or importation) of different racial and ethnic groups into one shared area.  Power dispersion and inter-group relations led to European dominance of the state, allowing it to directly shape [[nationality]] although not without internal division or influence from the less empowered races.

==Dutch colonial rule==

South African nationality begins with its history as a European colony.  In 1652, the [[Dutch East India Company]] (abbreviated V.O.C., in reference to the original Dutch version of this title or DEIC) established the first permanent European settlement in the Cape region.  At that time, the pastoral group known as the [[Khoikhoi]] inhabited the region along with other [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] peoples who had emigrated from the Northwest approximately 1500 years prior.  The Dutch formally purchased land from the Khoikhoi in 1671 and [[Cape Colony]] was established.

As the colony developed and expanded, [[Slavery in South Africa|slaves]] from other African regions as well as parts of South and [[Southeast Asia]] were imported to work in agriculture and in domestic service.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, p.25-26&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 18th century, the growth in population of white settlers was nearly identical to increases in slave populations, despite the fact that the slaves were predominantly male.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the society under Dutch rule was a mixture of races and ethnic groups: the indigenous Khoikhoi peoples, the white settlers of European descent who eventually became [[Afrikaners]], and the heterogeneous slave populations from various other parts of Africa and Asia.  Since only members of V.O.C. had the right to land ownership or political power, the colony's [[Law of South Africa|system of law]] internalized and perpetuated racial inequalities.  The constrictive, domineering administrative policies of the V.O.C. led to considerable settler resentment of authority structures, and the [[libertarianism]] associated with the [[Boers]] (South Africans of Dutch descent).

==British colonial rule==
The imposition of [[British colonial rule]] created a tense dynamic between the two European groups.  They mutually occupied the position of dominant colonizer in the early society, but their linguistic, cultural and ideological differences created friction between the two groups.  In the case of the Boers, this imposing force served to unite their fractioned groups under a single identity against a common enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

===British authority===
The British aimed to adjust the cultural life of colonial society to the legal realities of British rule.  This meant imposing their system of beliefs, their organizational methods, and their political idiosyncrasies on the colonized groups as well developing new ones.  After an unsuccessful attempt to claim the [[colony]] in 1795, the British permanently established their control between 1806 and 1815.  An influx of British pioneers entered the colony, introducing the English language to the region and setting up new frontier settlements.  In 1822, the court system was anglicized, posing a significant disadvantage to [[Afrikaans]]-speaking individuals.&lt;ref name="Davenport, 45"&gt;Davenport, 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Incentives were offered to teachers who conducted their lessons in English, resulting in a transition from Dutch to English education with adverse long-term effects on Afrikaner education levels.  The British introduced the [[Roman Dutch law]] system.  Law enforcement and court systems were centralized by the British, countering the Boer tradition of small, local courts and [[Decentralization|decentralized]] democracy.&lt;ref name="Davenport, 45"/&gt;

===Abolition of slavery===
Under British rule, relations with the Afrikaners were harmonious at first, but a growing ethnic tension began as the British began to assert their political and cultural dominance over the Boers.  While British colonists maintained their British citizenship, this status was extended neither to the Boers nor the Africa and Asia populations who all became British subjects.

Nevertheless, the British also imported liberal, post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values.  The [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] abolished the slave trade throughout the British empire and established humanitarian guidelines restricting slave-owners.  Despite protests by slave owners, the slaves were legally liberated throughout the British Empire by the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]].  The emancipation of the Khoikhoi and other non-Europeans was the result of considerable pressure from various missionary groups within the colony rather than from the metropole.  The introduction of circuit courts specifically for upholding claims from former slaves against former masters led to the "Black circuit" commissions, which aroused considerable public outcry when the law was actually enforced in cases of black men against white men.

Between 1809 and 1823, [[Du Pré Alexander, 2nd Earl of Caledon]] established a series of policies addressing the pressing issue of landlessness that emancipation had created.  Collectively, these policies formed a paternalistic code that gave the former slaves some protection but also relegated them to the lowest status in society.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, 48&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1828, Ordinance 50 made it possible for blacks and Asians to own property, abolished the requirement that they carry identification passes, and required employers to provide contracts for all work.  While the content of this law was clearly intended to aid the former-slave populations, these measures were implemented minimally if at all and inequalities between the races persisted.

===Violent conflict between Boers and British===
Despite the shared sense of white superiority, the English-speaking groups and the Afrikaners were pitted against one another in competition for political, economic and cultural dominance.  This conflict led to the hardening of the two groups' respective national identities and eventually resulted in the expansion beyond the Cape Colony, two wars and the creation of a New South African state.

In 1835, a group of Boers left the colony in search of a new territory to establish their own society free from British control.  These individuals were known as the [[Voortrekkers]] ("pioneers") and their exodus became known as the [[Great Trek]].  While this endeavor proved hazardous and less productive than they may have envisioned, it provided a model for subsequent Boer migrations away from British sovereignty and the establishment of separate Boer states ([[Orange Free State]], [[South African Republic]], [[Colony of Natal]]).  These republics had their own governments and independent migration policies regulating the influx of workers from [[India]], [[Asia]] and elsewhere in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaaren, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the 19th century, tension increased between the [[British Empire]] and these autonomous Boer communities.  The British pursued expansionist policies, annexing [[Natalia Republic|Natal]] in 1845 but recognizing the independence of the other two republics until 1877 when a Zulu insurrection threatened the [[Transvaal Republic]].  In 1880, the [[First Boer War]] erupted between Transvaal Boers and British troops, resulting in relatively heavy losses on the British side leading to a truce in 1881.  After two decades of uneasy peace between the groups, military conflict broke out again in 1899 in what would be the [[Second Boer War]].  This war significantly deteriorated the Boers' land and resources, a result largely attributable to the British's '[[scorched earth]]' tactics.  Nevertheless, the resistance had been strong enough to change the British's policy regarding the Afrikaners from suppression to concession and incorporation into the government of the colony.

Throughout the two wars, the British portrayed themselves as fighting in defense of the African populations as well as for the interests of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;  Reformist rhetoric wooed black support for the war and the British did not hesitate to utilize this resource, despite the mutual commitment to leave the blacks out of the war.  Britain's decision to abandon their promises to the African population at the end of the war indicated a coming shift in the racial dynamic of South African nationality and its struggle.

==South African state==
===Surrender of the Boers===
The British colonial government met with the two Boer governments on 15 May 1902 in order to determine the terms of the Boer's surrender.  While Britain refused to give up their annexation of the [[Boer republics]], it did agree to repatriation, the limited protection of the Afrikaner language in the education and court system, the [[right to keep and bear arms|right to keep firearms]], the [[right to property]], exemption for land tax funding war expenditures, and to refuse the natives (blacks) political enfranchisement unless a white majority already existed (Article 8).&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, p.223&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milner regime===
[[Sir Alfred Milner]] was the governor of the Cape at the turn of the 20th century.  In reaction to the incorporation of the Boers back into the colony, Milner instated a series of attacks on the citizenship of Africans, Asians and people of mixed race.  Territorial separation of whites and blacks became a principle of land ownership.  It also removed blacks' right to select their own political representative in the federal legislature and instituted a government-picked politician for them.  These reforms were designed by a group called the Lagden Commission.  While they were rejected initially, modified versions of these reforms were later implemented by General [[J. B. M. Hertzog]] (South Africa's third prime minister).  Following the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] rebellion in 1906, the Natal Native Code was streamlined and applied universally among African and Indian populations.  In effect, this gave the Government unlimited control over these populations while revoking their suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, p.230&lt;/ref&gt;  This sparked protest from both minority groups.  [[Mohandas Gandhi]]'s led several non-violent demonstrations against laws requiring Indians to carry finger-print passes.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, p.233&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Apartheid segregation===
The [[South Africa Act 1909]] established the [[Union of South Africa]] under the British dominion, giving it increased autonomy from the metropole.  This act unified the four provinces under one legislative body and gave suffrage to non-white groups, although its franchise policies further disempowered blacks in the Cape.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, p.95&lt;/ref&gt;  Colour bars were instituted in 1911, relegating blacks to low-income occupations with little to no prospect for upward mobility. By restricting land purchase to specific reserves, the [[Natives Land Act, 1913]] effectively forced African populations off of the land that would allow them to sustain any level of self-sufficiency, thereby making them dependent on the labour market for their livelihood.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Louis Botha]] was appointed the prime minister in 1910. He pushed a series of racial segregationist bills targeting the African populations. The [[Mines and Works Act]] of 1911 prohibited blacks from organizing into labour union and from striking, while simultaneously reserving prime categories of work for white people.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, p.258&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Natives (Urban Areas) Act]] of 1923 imposed segregation in the residential areas of cities and reduced blacks access to urban centers in general.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;  General Hertzog's subsequent government held these policies restricting black subjects, but made relatively little effort to increase segregating policy and focused more on creating a national (white) image. It did, however, remove Africans' limited rights to direct parliamentary suffrage in the [[Cape Province]].

==Apartheid policies regarding race==
The [[Apartheid]] ideology was developed by Werner Eiselen as an alternative to the policies of racial segregation which still allowed for a multi-racial society.  Apartheid was a system of relocating Africans to what were supposedly ethnically homogenous reservations and then fostering individual nationalities for each of these ten different groups.  This process was accompanied by a set of acts designed to coerce black groups into this new system and maximize their separation from white society while maintaining their economic exploitation (see [[Apartheid Legislation in South Africa]]).  The core of the Apartheid system was the [[Group Areas Act]] of 1950 which divided the state into race-specific partitions.

===Bantustans===
The formation of the first Afrikaner-only government in 1948 also coincided with the introduction of the Apartheid institution by which Africans were to be segregated and differentiated from the white population in all possible respects.  One of the most drastic components of this ideology was the establishment of Bantu homelands to which all Africans were regulated.  This forced blacks to live in "tribal" reservations, thereby separating them from the white populations and realigning their nationality directly to their particular reservation or "[[bantustan]]".  Ten separate bantustans were designated, each with its own "homogenous" group.  In 1970 the [[Black Homelands Citizenship Act]] effectively cancelled all black South African [[citizenship]] because these homelands became technically autonomous and self-governed.

===Pass laws===
{{Main|Pass laws}}
The [[Population Registration Act]] 30 of 1950 required all citizens to carry identification passes that detailed their race.  This limited black, Indian and Asian mobility because it restricted their access to white areas.

===Education===
The [[Bantu Education Act]] of 1953 reformatted the education system to prepare the black youth for racial submission to the white population.  Education was historically the jurisdiction of the Christian missionaries, but this act ceded its control to the state, who then used it to manipulate the black national identity

===Marriage and sexuality===
Sexual relations between races were restricted by both the [[Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act]] (1949) and the [[Immorality Act]] (1950), illustrating the social stigmas and fears surrounding black sexuality.

==Post-Apartheid==
With significant pressure from both internal and external sources, the Apartheid regime was dismantled by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (NP) in the early 1990s.  Serious negotiations between the National Party, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC) took place in an effort to produce a new democratic system that perpetuated racial equality but did not leave the whites dangerously vulnerable to resentment-fueled discrimination or violence.

===Creation of a new constitution and bill of rights===
Following the extension of [[universal suffrage]] and the subsequent election of the first ANC government, Parliament developed a new [[constitution]] and [[bill of rights]].  The first chapter of this constitution establishes the South African commitment to democratic values, human rights and rule of law.  The second chapter is the Bill of Rights and it describes the democratic freedoms that the state must uphold.  This includes the [[right to education]] in each of South Africa's official languages, the right to a healthy living environment, as well as the right to free movement and residence.&lt;ref&gt;http://SAHistory.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizenship==
South African citizenship has primarily been founded on conceptions of racial entitlement and lawful residence.&lt;ref&gt;Klaaren, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The development of migration restrictions attached to different racial groups in the Cape and the Boer Republics provided the precursor to South African citizenship: Union nationality.  The immigration laws reacting to the influx of Asian in the early 20th century provided the unidirectional basis of South African citizenship.  This identification method developed out of the Transvaal immigration bureaucracy became to standard throughout the other republics after the unification in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Klaaren, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The restrictive nature of union nationality led to the establishment of a categorical citizenship that lacked any positive rights.

The Bill of Rights created in 1996 established the modern characteristics of South African citizenship.  It utilizes a combination of the principles of ''[[jus soli]]'' and ''[[jus sanguinis]]''.  Children born in South Africa to parents who are both permanent residents (but not citizens) or to one parent who is a citizen will obtain citizenship via ''jus soli''.  Children born outside the country to at least one citizen-parent can obtain citizenship if the South African population authorities are properly notified about the birth.  For many individuals born to non-permanent residents can apply for South African citizenship through the naturalization process which has eight primary requirements:

*  Valid permanent residence permit or exemption.
*  One year's ordinary residence in the Republic of South Africa immediately prior to the application.
*  In addition 4 years of physical (actual) residence in the RSA during the eight years before the application (excluding the year of ordinary residence).
*  If married to a South African spouse, two years of permanent residence and two years of marriage to the South African spouse immediately prior to the application.
*  Intends to continue to reside in the Republic or falls within the further categories specified in section 5(1)(e).
*  Be of good and sound character.
*  Able to communicate satisfactorily in any one of the official languages of South Africa.
* Have adequate knowledge of the duties and responsibilities of a South African citizen.&lt;ref&gt;http://home-affairs.pwv.gov.za/sa_citizenship.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Home taping is killing music.png|thumb|right|The original logo]]
"'''Home Taping Is Killing Music'''" was the slogan of a 1980s anti-[[copyright infringement]] propaganda campaign by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI), a British music industry trade group. With the rise in [[cassette deck|cassette recorder]] popularity, the BPI feared that the ability of private citizens to record music from the radio onto cassettes would cause a decline in record sales. The logo, consisting of a [[Jolly Roger]] formed from the silhouette of a [[Compact Cassette]], also included the words "And It's Illegal".

In the 2000s, the campaign experienced a revival, as the Norwegian branch of [[IFPI]] (International Federation of the Phonographic Industry) launched a new campaign named Piracy Kills Music. The campaign has exactly the same message, same name and similar logos. The campaign won the Norwegian 2008 [[Gulltaggen]] award for "Best Internet Strategy" with much controversy.{{fact|date=December 2014}}

An early proponent of home taping was [[Malcolm McLaren]], who was at the time managing the British [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Bow Wow Wow]]. In 1980, the band released their [[cassette single]] "[[C·30 C·60 C·90 Go]]" on cassette that featured a blank B-side on which the buyer could record their own music. The band's record label, [[EMI]], dropped the group shortly afterwards because the single allegedly promoted home taping.{{fact|date=December 2014}}

== Parodies ==
[[File:homesewing.svg|thumb|200px|Example of a parody of the original logo]]
The slogan was often [[parody|parodied]], one example being the addendum ''and it's about time too!'', used by Dutch [[anarcho-punk]] band [[The Ex (band)|The Ex]]. Some [[fanzines]] changed the words to ''Home taping is killing the music industry'' and added the words ''...so be sure to do your part!'' below the logo. Another example was the early 1980s counter-slogan ''Home Taping is Skill in Music'', referring to early [[mixtapes]], a precursor to [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[remix]]es. The cassette &amp; crossbones image was displayed briefly as a backdrop in the "Time Out For Fun" video by the band [[Devo]] from their 1982 album, ''[[Oh, No! It's Devo]]''. [[Venom (band)|Venom]]'s 1982 album ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' used the logo with the words ''Home Taping Is Killing Music; So Are Venom''. The phrase ''Home-Taping Is Making Music'' appears on the back cover of Peter Principle's self-produced 1988 album ''[[Tone Poems (album)|Tone Poems]]''. The [[United States|American]] punk band [[Rocket from the Crypt]] sold T-shirts with the tape and bones and the words "Home Taping Is Killing the Music Industry: Killing Ain't Wrong." [[Sonic Youth]] has T-shirts with the cassette and "Sonic Youth" written under it.&lt;ref&gt;https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.kungfustore.com/system/photos/assets/5684/5684-max.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of [[Billy Bragg|Billy Bragg's]] album ''[[Workers Playtime (Billy Bragg album)|Workers Playtime]]'' featured a notice reading "[[Capitalism]] is killing music - pay no more than £4.99 for this record".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/2006/11/15/102223/music-review-billy-bragg-volume-ii.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724050025/http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/2006/11/15/102223/music-review-billy-bragg-volume-ii.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-24 |title=Music Review: Billy Bragg Volume II |work=Community Care }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitch Benn]] also comments "Home taping isn't killing music, music's dying of natural causes" in the song "Steal This Song" on the album ''Radioface''.
In Poland during the mid-1980s, some (PRONIT label) vinyl pressings of certain albums contained a parody stamp labeled "Home taping... is much fun".{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

One cassette version of the [[Dead Kennedys]] e.p. ''[[In God We Trust Inc.]]'' had a blank side, printed with the message "Home taping is killing record industry profits! We left this side blank so you can help."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alex Sayf Cummings|title=Democracy of Sound: Music Piracy and the Remaking of American Copyright in the Twentieth Century|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199858224|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, rock group [[The Beat (American band)|The Beat]] sold blank cassette tapes as merchandise at their live shows. The band frequently encouraged fans and concert patrons to record their live performances instead of illegally copying their studio albums. The group's leader [[Paul Collins (musician)|Paul Collins]], believed this practice would satisfy a need for instant gratification while preventing the sales of their albums from diminishing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} &lt;!-- We also need confirmation that this was intentionally parodying the article's subject --&gt;

[[File:The Pirate Bay logo.svg|thumb|200px|[[The Pirate Bay]] logo with cassette and crossbones.]]
More recently, the pro-[[Peer-to-peer|p2p]] [[file sharing]] group [[Downhill Battle]] has used the slogan "Home Taping Is Killing the Music Industry, and It's Fun" on T-shirts, and the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] website ''[[The Pirate Bay]]'' uses the logo of a pirate ship whose sails bear the "tape and bones." Additionally the [[Pirate Party UK]] has a version of the tape and bones with the logo "copyright is killing music - and it's legal" and the Swedish [[Piratbyrån]] is using the same tape and bones as their logo.{{fact|date=December 2014}}

Similar rhetoric has continued; in 1982 [[Jack Valenti]] famously compared the [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]] and its [[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.|anticipated effect on the movie industry]] to the [[Boston Strangler]], and in 2005 [[Mitch Bainwol]] of the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] claimed that [[CD burner|CD burning]] is hurting music sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/163587594|title=Intellectual property : a reference handbook|last=Aaron.|first=Schwabach,|date=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc|isbn=9781598840452|oclc=163587594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=CD-burning threatens music sales|last=|first=|date=August 16, 2005|work=Cincinnati Post|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=|via=Newsbank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]], as part of its campaign against the UK Government's filesharing proposals, created a spoof video entitled "Home Taping is Killing Music".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2638">'''Indirect effect''' is a principle of [[European Union law|European Union (EU) law]], whereby national courts of the [[Member state of the European Union|member states of the EU]] are required to interpret national law in line with provisions of EU law. The principle of indirect effect contrasts with the principle of [[direct effect]], which, under certain conditions, allows individuals to invoke the EU law itself before national courts.

Indirect effect arises from the failure of a member state to implement a directive{{mdash}}either correctly or at all{{mdash}}but where direct effect cannot apply because the party against whom the directive is sought to be enforced is a private entity or otherwise fails to meet the conditions which would give the directive [[direct effect]]. In ''[[Von Colson v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen|Von Colson and Kamann v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen]]'', the ECJ ruled that national courts should interpret national law in line with the directive, "in so far as it is given discretion to do so under national law".&lt;ref&gt;Case 14/83 [1984] ECR 1891 at para 28.&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Von Colson'' dealt with a situation where a member state had failed to implement a directive correctly, in ''[[Marleasing v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion]]'' the ECJ extended indirect effect to situations where the member state concerned had not implemented the directive at all.&lt;ref&gt;Case C-106/89, [1990] ECR I-4135.&lt;/ref&gt;

While indirect effect is of great importance especially in relation to directives, recommendations and opinions could have indirect effect as well. Recommendations and opinions have no binding force, like directives have. However, in ''[[Grimaldi v Fonds des Maladies Professionnelles]]'' the ECJ has ruled that since recommendations and opinions must have some legal effect, they should be taken into consideration when dealing with measures that the two were supposed to supplement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = European Union Law|url = https://books.google.co.il/books?id=p4lwXozo8YcC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=indirect+effect+treaties+regulations+directives+decisions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-ieXCOn2iq&amp;sig=gwPvbd2AQLhc3mYCPTYNU46DG4M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=indirect%2520effect%2520treaties%2520regulations%2520directives%2520decisions&amp;f=false|publisher = OUP Oxford|date = 2007-03-29|isbn = 9780199282449|language = en|first = Elspeth|last = Berry|first2 = Sylvia|last2 = Hargreaves|page = 63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knowing receipt''' is an [[English trusts law]] doctrine for imposing liability on people who receive property that belonged to a trust, or was held by a [[fiduciary]], and knew that it been given to them in breach of trust. To be liable for knowing receipt, the claimant must show, first, a disposal of his trust assets in breach of [[fiduciary duty]]; second, the beneficial receipt by the defendant of assets which are traceable as representing the assets of the claimant; and third, knowledge on the part of the defendant that the assets he received are traceable to a breach of fiduciary duty.&lt;ref&gt;''[[El Ajou v Dollar Land Holdings]]'' [1994] 2 All ER 685, 700&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Knowing receipt" is also sometimes called "unconscionable receipt"&lt;ref&gt;G. Thomas and A Hudson, ''The Law of Trusts'' (OUP, 2010) 900-920&lt;/ref&gt; because of its theoretical foundation in the doctrine of unconscionability. The contrary view is that knowing receipt is, or ought to be, part of a broader doctrine of ignorance triggering a claim for [[unjust enrichment]]. On this view, anyone who receive property that was given away in breach of trust has a strict duty to repay the value, unless they have committed a wrong, or have changed their position after the receipt. This model suggests that knowledge is not exclusively relevant for liability.

==Underlying principle==
The underlying principle of knowing receipt is beneficial receipt of D is unjust enrichment at the expense of the rightful owner. In ''[[Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan]]'', knowing receipt is characterized as [[restitution]]-based liability (as opposed to accessory liability).

==Degree of knowledge required==
Under knowing receipt, the onus is on the claimant beneficiary to establish recipient’s knowledge. The degree of knowledge required has been a controversial issue and there are numerous lines of authority on it. For example in some cases it was held that Baden category 1 to 3 knowledge, i.e. [[dishonesty]] is needed, or in some cases it was held that all 5 categories would suffice, i.e. either dishonesty or [[negligence]]. 

In ''[[Belmont Finance Corp Ltd v Williams Furniture (No 2)]]'' it was held thatfraud/dishonesty not required, i.e. [[negligence]] would suffice. In ''[[El Ajou v Dollar Land Holdings plc]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1993] 3 All ER 717&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that constructive knowledge was sufficient; Though in ''[[Polly Peck Int’l plc v Nadir (No 2)]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1992] 4 All ER 769&lt;/ref&gt; Scott LJ agreed that courts are always reluctant to extend constructive notice doctrine to circumstances when money is paid in ordinary course of business.

At last, in ''[[BCCI (Overseas) Ltd v Akindele]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2001] Ch 437&lt;/ref&gt; it was held that the degree of knowledge for knowing receipt is knowledge that makes it unconscionable for recipient to retain benefit of receipt. It was also held that the five categories of knowledge in Baden is not useful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39798">'''''Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.''''', is an American legal case involving the [[computer printer]] company [[Lexmark]], which had designed an authentication system using a [[microcontroller]] so that only authorized [[toner]] cartridges could be used. The resulting litigation (described by [[Justice Scalia]] in 2014 as "sprawling",&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court ruling, at fn. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and by others as having the potential to go on as long as ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce|Jarndyce v. Jarndyce]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Lee Gesmer|title = ''Lexmark v. Static Control'' – 12 Years and Still Going Strong|url = http://masslawblog.com/trademark/lexmark-v-static-control-12-years-and-still-going-strong/|publisher = MassLawBlog|date = March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) has resulted in significant decisions affecting United States intellectual property and trademark law.

In separate rulings in 2004 and 2012, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] ruled that:

* circumvention of Lexmark's ink cartridge authentication does not violate the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), and
* Static Control Components had standing basis under the [[Lanham Act]] to sue Lexmark for [[false advertising]] in relation to its promotion of the program, which was unanimously affirmed in 2014 by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;ref name="scotus-slip"&gt;''Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.'', {{ussc |3=2013 |docket=12-873 }} (March 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court's 2014 ruling also affects statutory interpretation in the area of [[Standing (law)|standing]] in pursuing lawsuits on statutory grounds in a wide variety of areas in federal court.

==Background==
[[Lexmark]] is a large manufacturer of [[laser printer|laser]] and [[inkjet printer]]s,&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage2"&gt;Circuit Court ruling, Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Static Control Components]] (SCC) is a company that makes "a wide range of technology products, including microchips that it sells to third-party companies for use in [[Toner refill|remanufactured toner cartridge]]s." &lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage2" /&gt;

In an effort to control and reduce the refilling and redistribution of toner cartridges, Lexmark began distributing two distinct varieties of its toner cartridges. Under its Prebate Program (now known as the Lexmark Return Program), through a [[shrinkwrap license]], Lexmark sold certain printer cartridges at a discount (as much as $50 less)&lt;ref name="DistrictRulingPage3"&gt;Dictrict Court ruling, Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; to customers who agreed to "use the cartridge only once and return it only to Lexmark for remanufacturing or recycling". Lexmark's "Non-Prebate" cartridges could be refilled by the user without restrictions and were sold without any discount.

Lexmark touted the Prebate Program as a benefit to the environment and to their customers, since it would allow customers to get cheaper cartridges, and the benefit to Lexmark was that it could keep empty cartridges out of the hands of competing rechargers. Many users purchased such cartridges under the stated conditions.

To enforce this agreement, Lexmark cartridges included a computer chip that included a 55-byte computer program (the "Toner Loading Program") which communicated with a "Printer Engine Program" built into the printer. The program calculated the amount of toner used during printing: when the calculations indicated that the original supply of Lexmark toner should be exhausted, the printer would stop functioning, even if the cartridge had been refilled.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage3"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if the chip did not perform an encrypted authentication sequence, or if the Toner Loading Program on the chip did not have a checksum matching exactly a value stored elsewhere on the chip, the printer would not use the cartridge.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage4"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, SCC developed its own computer chip that would duplicate the 'handshake' used by the Lexmark chip, and that also included a verbatim copy of the Toner Loading Program, which SCC claimed was necessary to allow the printer to function. A Prebate cartridge could successfully be refilled if Lexmark's chip on the cartridge was replaced with the SCC chip.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage3" /&gt; SCC began selling its "Smartek" chips to toner cartridge rechargers.

===At the district court===
On December 30, 2002, Lexmark sued SCC in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky]]. The suit claimed that SCC had:

* violated copyright law&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|106}}&lt;/ref&gt; by copying the Toner Loading Program, and
* violated the DMCA&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|1201}}&lt;/ref&gt; by selling products that circumvented the encrypted authentication sequence between the Lexmark cartridge chip and the printer.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage4"/&gt;

On March 3, 2003, Judge [[Karl S. Forester]] granted a [[preliminary injunction]] to Lexmark, blocking SCC from distributing its cartridge chips. The ruling was seen to be controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date= Fall 2003|title= Note: Control of the Aftermarket Through Copyright in ''Lexmark International, Inc. v.

On the copyright claim, the court found that:

* the use of the Toner Loading Program was indeed a likely copyright violation,&lt;ref name="DistrictRulingPage23"&gt;District Court ruling, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; because the Toner Loading Program was not a "lock-out code" that SCC was entitled to copy under the DMCA,&lt;ref name="DistrictRulingPage7"&gt;District Court ruling, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DistrictRulingPage24"&gt;District Court ruling, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and because the Toner Loading Program could be rewritten in different ways (and therefore had enough creativity to qualify for copyright protection).&lt;ref name="DistrictRulingPage23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DistrictRulingPage9"&gt;District Court ruling, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Copyright Office's decision to grant copyright registration to the two programs showed that the programs were probably copyrightable.&lt;ref name="DistrictRulingPage24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DistrictRulingPage11"&gt;District Court ruling, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* because of the complexity of the authentication system, SCC could not have known that it could bypass the authentication without using Lexmark's copyrighted program; but it held that this did not matter because "Innocent infringement, however, is still infringement."&lt;ref name="DistrictRulingPage25"&gt;District Court ruling, page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[fair use]] did not apply.&lt;ref name="DistrictRulingPage28"&gt;District Court ruling, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the DMCA claims, the court found that the SCC microchip circumvented Lexmark's authentication sequence,&lt;ref name="DistrictRulingPage18"&gt;District Court ruling, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DistrictRulingPage42"&gt;District Court ruling, page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the [[reverse engineering]] exception to the DMCA did not apply, because it only covers the ''independent creation'' of new programs that must interoperate with existing ones, and SCC did not create any new program.&lt;ref name="DistrictRulingPage47"&gt;District Court ruling, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The appellate ruling===
SCC appealed the district court's ruling to the [[Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]]. As is usual for federal appeals in the United States, a three judge panel heard the appeal&amp;ndash; for this matter, the panel consisted of appellate judges [[Gilbert Stroud Merritt, Jr.|Gilbert S. Merritt]] and [[Jeffrey Sutton|Jeffrey S. Sutton]], and [[John Feikens]] (a district court judge temporarily assisting the appeals court). On October 26, 2004, the judges issued their ruling, in which all three judges wrote separate opinions.

====Majority opinion====
In the majority opinion, Judge Sutton (with Judge Merritt agreeing) reversed the lower court's ruling and vacated the temporary injunction, holding that Lexmark was unlikely to succeed in its case. The case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.

On the copyright claim, the court noted that unlike [[patent]]s, copyright protection cannot be applied to ideas, but only to particular, creative expressions of ideas.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage6"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Distinguishing between an unprotectable idea and a protectable creative expression is difficult in the context of computer programs; even though it may be possible to express the same idea in many different programs, "practical realities"—hardware and software constraints, design standards, industry practices, etc.—may make different expressions impractical.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage7"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; "Lock-out" codes—codes that must be performed in a certain way in order to bypass a security system—are generally considered functional rather than creative, and thus unprotectable.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage7" /&gt;

With these principles in mind, it was held that the district court had erred in three ways:
# It had held that the Toner Loading Program was copyrightable simply because it "could be written in a number of different ways", without considering the practical realities.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage9"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Because of this mistaken standard, it had refused to consider whether or not the alternative Toner Loading Programs proposed by Lexmark were practical.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage10"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
# It had concluded that the Toner Loading Program was not a "lock-out code", because it had not sufficiently considered how difficult it would be for SCC—without Lexmark's knowledge of the code's structure and purpose—to alter the code and still pass the printer's authentication mechanisms.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage11"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the DMCA claims, the majority first considered Lexmark's claim that the SCC chip circumvented the access controls on the Printer Engine Program. It held that Lexmark's authentication sequence did not "control access" to the program; rather, the purchase of the printer itself allowed access to the program:

{{Quote|
Anyone who buys a Lexmark printer may read the literal code of the Printer Engine Program directly from the printer memory, with or without the benefit of the authentication sequence[...]No security device, in other words, protects access to the Printer Engine Program[...]&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage16"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Likewise, the majority opinion held that anyone purchasing a printer and toner cartridge could read the Toner Loading Program from the printer; so SCC did not circumvent an access control on the Toner Loading Program either.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage18"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court also rejected the district court's conclusion that the interoperability defense did not apply. Since SCC had offered testimony that its chips did indeed contain independently-created programs in addition to Lexmark's Toner Loading Program, the Toner Loading Program could be seen as necessary to allow interoperation between SCC's own programs and the Lexmark printer.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage19"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Concurring opinion====
In a concurring opinion, Judge Merritt agreed with Judge Sutton on the outcome of this particular case, but also indicated that he would go farther:

{{Quote|
I write separately to emphasize that our holding should not be limited to the narrow facts surrounding either the Toner Loading Program or the Printer Engine Program. We should make clear that in the future companies like Lexmark cannot use the DMCA in conjunction with copyright law to create monopolies of manufacturer goods for themselves[...]
}}

He opined that even if the programs involved were more complex (and thus more deserving of copyright protection), the key question would be the purpose of the circumvention technology. Under his proposed framework, if a third party manufacturer's use of a circumvention technology was intended only to allow its products to interoperate with another manufacturer's—and not to gain any independent benefit from the functionality of the code being copied—then that circumvention would be permissible.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage21"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Concurring/dissenting opinion====
Judge Feikens also wrote an opinion, agreeing with many of the majority opinion's results (though sometimes for different reasons), but disagreeing with its conclusion on the Toner Loading Program.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage23"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the copyrightability of the Toner Loading Program, he found that the record supported Lexmark's claim that the program could have been implemented in any number of ways, and therefore Lexmark's implementation was creative and copyrightable.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage23" /&gt; Agreeing that the record was inadequate for the district court to conclude that the Toner Loading Program was a "lock-out code", he noted that Lexmark's expert had testified that the entire Toner Loading Program process could be turned off by flipping a single bit in the chip's code, and that it should have been possible for SCC to discover this; so copying the program may not have been practically necessary too.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage24"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the DMCA counts, Feikens agreed that Lexmark had not established a violation with regards to the Toner Loading Program, but for a very different reason than that found by the majority opinion. He noted that SCC had testified that it had not even been aware that the Toner Loading Program existed; it had copied the data on the Lexmark printer chip (including the Toner Loading Program) purely in an attempt to bypass the protection on the Printer Engine Program. Since the DMCA requires that an infringer ''knowingly'' circumvent access controls on the protected program, SCC could not have knowingly circumvented protections on a program it did not know existed.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage30"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to the Printer Engine Program, he agreed with the majority opinion, but also noted in his belief that the consumer had acquired the rights to access this program by purchasing the printer, and therefore the DMCA would not apply to attempts to access it.&lt;ref name="AppealRulingPage31"&gt;Sixth Circuit opinion, page 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Request for a rehearing===
Lexmark filed a request for the full Sixth Circuit to hear the case ''[[en banc]]''. The Sixth Circuit rejected this request in February 2005.

Rule 13 of the [[United States Supreme Court]] [https://www.supremecourt.gov/ctrules/rulesofthecourt.pdf Rules of Procedure] requires the losing party in a case before a court of appeals to file a petition for a [[writ of certiorari]] within 90 days from the date the court of appeals enters its judgment, or from the date of the denial of a petition for rehearing in the court of appeals. The Sixth Circuit's judgment became final for all purposes when the 90-day period expired without Lexmark filing a cert petition.

===Impact===
The Sixth Circuit's decision is noteworthy for at least two reasons:

# All three judges took pains to emphasize in their opinions that the DMCA must be interpreted consistently with the broader public purposes of the copyright statute, rather than as a grant of new powers to makers of technology products to impose additional restrictions not contemplated by copyright.
# It represents a rare defeat for large printer manufacturers like Lexmark, [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Epson]] in their ongoing battle with third-party ink sellers.

''Lexmark 2004'' is also consistent with subsequent jurisprudence in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] in ''[[The Chamberlain Group, Inc. v. Skylink Technologies, Inc.]]'', and therefore emphasizes that the DMCA was intended to create a new type of liability {{emdash}} not a property right {{emdash}} over durable goods incorporating copyrighted material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Caryn C.

}}

===District Court===

Before the Sixth Circuit's ruling, Static Control initiated a separate action in 2004 seeking declaratory judgment under federal copyright laws and the DMCA that its newly modified chips did not infringe Lexmark's copyrights, and Lexmark counterclaimed raising patent infringement, DMCA violations, and tort claims, and added three remanufacturers as third-party defendants.

On remand, Lexmark successfully moved to dismiss all of Static Control's counterclaims. During the course of the proceedings, the court ruled that:

* nine of Lexmark's mechanical patents were valid, but two of its design patents were invalid,&lt;ref name="R. 1008 D. Ct. Order 4/24/07"&gt;R. 1008 (D. Ct. Order 4/24/07)&lt;/ref&gt;
* summary judgment would be granted to Lexmark on its claims of direct patent infringement against three co-defendants,&lt;ref&gt;R. 1245 (D. Ct. Order 5/31/07)&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Lexmark's single-use license for Prebate cartridges was valid, which prevented Lexmark's patents from exhausting following the initial sale of the Prebate toner cartridges to end users.&lt;ref name="R. 1008 D. Ct. Order 4/24/07"/&gt; However, this was subsequently modified by the judge later, after the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]''&lt;ref&gt;2009 WL 891811, at *1&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the trial's issues consisted only of Lexmark's claim of induced patent infringement against Static Control and Static Control's defense of patent misuse. The district judge [[Gregory Frederick Van Tatenhove]] instructed the jury that its findings on patent misuse would be advisory; the jury held that Static Control did not induce patent infringement and advised that Lexmark misused its patents. Lexmark renewed its earlier request for a judgment as a matter of law and also filed a motion for a retrial on its patent inducement claim, both of which the district court denied. Both parties timely appealed.

===The appellate ruling===
In a unanimous ruling, the district court's findings were affirmed, except for its dismissal of Static Control's counterclaims under the [[Lanham Act]] and North Carolina state law. These were reversed and remanded for further consideration.

In particular, it was held:

* the 6th Circuit had jurisdiction to hear the appeal under {{usc|28|1291}} (as opposed to being referred to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] under {{usc|28|1295}}),
* the district court did not abuse its discretion in increasing the amount of the injunction bond entered during the preliminary injunction hearing,
* SCC's federal antitrust counterclaims under  §§ 4 and 16 of the [[Clayton Act]] for violations of §§ 1 and 2 of the [[Sherman Act]] failed for lack of standing, under the standard set in ''Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters'' ("AGC"),&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters'' ("AGC"), {{ussc |459|519|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* SCC's counterclaim for false advertising under the [[Lanham Act]] is valid, as the 6th Circuit applies a "reasonable interest" standard to determine standing (in common with the 2nd Circuit, as opposed to the categorical test used in the Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Circuits, or the AGC approach used in the Third, Fifth, Eighth and Eleventh Circuits),
* SCC's counterclaim for unfair competition and false advertising under North Carolina's Unfair Deceptive Trade Practices Act&lt;ref&gt;N.C.

===Impact===
The ruling also let stand the district court's ruling of the impact of ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]'' on the [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law|exhaustion doctrine]] in the area of patent law. By finding that the sale of patented goods, even when subject to valid license restrictions, exhausts patent rights, it essentially gives ''Quanta'' a broad interpretation, which threatens to render unenforceable through patent law differential licensing schemes that attempt to distinguish separate fields of use for a patented item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Amanda J.

===Appeal of the 2012 ruling===
The Circuit Court's ruling with respect to standing under the Lanham Act was appealed by Lexmark to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], on which certiorari was granted on June 3, 2013. The case was heard on December 3, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ''Lexmark International, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc.'', Docket 12-873|url = {{SCOTUS URL Docket|12-873}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the question presented to the Court was:

{{Quote|
Whether the appropriate analytic framework for determining a party's standing to maintain an action for false advertising under the Lanham Act is:

#the factors set forth in ''Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters'',&lt;ref name = "AGC"&gt;''Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters'', {{ussc|459|519|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; as adopted by the Third, Fifth, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits;
#the categorical test, permitting suits only by an actual competitor, employed by the Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits; or
#a version of the more expansive "reasonable interest" test, either as applied by the Sixth Circuit in this case or as applied by the Second Circuit in prior cases.
}}

Lexmark argued in favour of the ''AGC'' test, while SCC argued that the appropriate test should actually be that of the "zone of interests" protected by the statute&lt;ref name = "Bennett"&gt;''Bennett v. Spear'', {{ussc|520|154|1997}}, 162-163&lt;/ref&gt; that has been applied in cases involving the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]], the [[Endangered Species Act]], and [[Title VII of the Civil Rights Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Argument preview: Justices to descend into morass of standing doctrine|url = http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/11/argument-preview-justices-to-descend-into-morass-of-standing-doctrine/|publisher = SCOTUSblog|date = November 29, 2013|author = Ronald Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Previewing Lexmark vs Static Control, A Rare Supreme Court Case On False Advertising|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericgoldman/2013/12/02/previewing-lexmark-vs-static-control-a-rare-supreme-court-case-on-false-advertising/|publisher = ''[[Forbes]]''|date = December 2, 2013|author = Eric Goldman}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the hearing, it appeared that Lexmark's submission received more intensive examination than SCC's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Argument analysis: Argument in standing case presages rare win for Sixth Circuit|url = http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/12/argument-analysis-argument-in-standing-case-presages-rare-win-for-sixth-circuit/|publisher = SCOTUSblog|date = December 5, 2013|author = Ronald Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision===
On March 25, 2014, the US Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the Sixth Circuit's holding that Static Control did have standing to sue under the Lanham Act.&lt;ref name="scotus-slip" /&gt;

The Court developed a new test for assessing standing in false advertising, rejecting the existing tests, including the Sixth Circuit's "reasonable interest test".&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;{{cite web|author = Eric Goldman|authorlink = Eric Goldman|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericgoldman/2014/03/26/supreme-court-changes-false-advertising-law-across-the-country/|title = Supreme Court Changes False Advertising Law Across the Country|publisher = ''[[Forbes]]''|date= March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that regard, the approach adopted by Scalia J. consists of several steps:&lt;ref name="scotus-slip" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goldman" /&gt;

#Under [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]], the plaintiff must have suffered or be imminently threatened with a concrete and particularized "injury in fact" that is fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife]]'', {{ussc|504|555|1992}}, at 560&lt;/ref&gt;
#''AGC'' requires the ascertainment, as a matter of statutory interpretation, of the "scope of the private remedy created by" Congress, and the "class of persons who [could] maintain a private damages action under" a legislatively conferred cause of action.&lt;ref name = "AGC"/&gt;
#A statutory cause of action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests "fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked,"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Allen v. Wright]]'', {{ussc|468|737|1984}}, at 751&lt;/ref&gt; and the "zone of interests" formulation applies to all statutorily created causes of action, as it is a "requirement of general application" and Congress is presumed to "legislat[e] against the background of" it, "which applies unless it is expressly negated."&lt;ref name = "Bennett"/&gt;
#A statutory cause of action is also presumed to be limited to plaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by violations of the statute.&lt;ref&gt;''Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation'', {{ussc|503|258|1992}}, at 268{{endash}}270&lt;/ref&gt; A plaintiff suing under §1125(a) ordinarily must show that its economic or reputational injury flows directly from the deception wrought by the defendant's advertising; and that occurs when deception of consumers causes them to withhold trade from the plaintiff.
#Direct application of the zone-of-interests test and the proximate-cause requirement supplies the relevant limits on who may sue under §1125(a).

In discussing the scope of proximate cause, Scalia noted:

{{Quote|
The District Court emphasized that Lexmark and Static Control are not direct competitors. But when a party claims reputational injury from disparagement, competition is not required for proximate cause; and that is true even if the defendant's aim was to harm its immediate competitors, and the plaintiff merely suffered collateral damage. Consider two rival carmakers who purchase airbags for their cars from different third-party manufacturers. If the first carmaker, hoping to divert sales from the second, falsely proclaims that the airbags used by the second carmaker are defective, both the second carmaker and its airbag supplier may suffer reputational injury, and their sales may decline as a result. In those circumstances, there is no reason to regard either party's injury as derivative of the other's; each is directly and independently harmed by the attack on its merchandise.

'''''Liber Horn''''' is a book completed in 1311 by [[Andrew Horn]]. [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] (the official archive of the UK government) describes it as "a compilation of charters, statutes and customs". It is thought to have been a compilation of two separate books: ''De Veteribus Legibus Angliae'' and ''De Statutes.'' The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' describes it as "the most comprehensive of all statute collections".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=075-col_07&amp;cid=6-1-3#6-1-3 The National Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13780 ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'']&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of ''Liber Horn'' were reproduced in [[The Statutes of the Realm|''Statutes of the Realm'']], Volume 1.&lt;ref name="Seabourne2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwen Seabourne|title=Royal regulation of loans and sales in medieval England: monkish superstition and civil tyranny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j3c9TUeP4msC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=12 February 2012|year=2003|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=978-1-84383-022-1|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Libraries Offences Act 1898''' (61 &amp; 62 Vict c 52) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], applying in England and Wales.

It provided that certain behaviour in libraries and reading-rooms were considered an offence, liable on [[summary conviction]] to a fine of up to forty shillings. The Act extended to any public library established under the [[Public Libraries Act 1892]], as well as to a library or reading-room maintained by any Industrial or Provident Society, any Friendly Society, or any registered trades union. The Act prohibited, where it was "to the annoyance or disturbance" of any other user - disorderly behaviour, the use of obscene or abusive language, gambling or betting, and persistently remaining within the library beyond its stated closing hours. It applied only to England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;''The public general acts passed in the sixty-first &amp; sixty-second years of the reign of her majesty Queen Victoria''. London: printed for Her Majesty's Stationery Office. 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act is still in force, though to a limited degree; it no longer extends to public libraries, which are dealt with under the [[Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964]], and as such it only applies to libraries maintained by trade unions or industrial, provident or friendly societies. The forty-shilling fine has now been replaced by a fine of up to level 1 on the [[standard scale]].

Since the founding of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1900, it has seen a steady number of splits and breakaway factions. Some of the breakaway organisations have thrived as independent parties, some have become defunct, while others have merged back with the parent party or other political parties

[[File:BLACK BEAR 10 (37).jpg|thumb|[[Slovakia|Slovak]] military police]]
'''Military police''' ('''MP''') are [[law enforcement agencies]] connected with, or part of, the [[military]] of a state.

In different countries it may refer to:

* A section of the military responsible for policing the areas of responsibility of the [[armed forces]] (referred to as [[Provost (military police)|provosts]]) against all criminal activity by military or civilian personnel
* A section of the military responsible for policing in both the armed forces and in the civilian population (most [[gendarmerie]]s, such as the [[National Gendarmerie|French Gendarmerie]])
* A section of the military solely responsible for policing the civilian population (such as the [[Gendarmerie (Romania)|Romanian Gendarmerie]] or the [[Carabineros de Chile|Chilean Carabineros]])
* The preventive police forces of each [[States of Brazil|Brazilian state]] (''[[Military Police (Brazil)|Polícia Militar]]''), responsible for policing the civilian population, which become auxiliary forces of the Brazilian Army in time of war

The status of military police is usually prominently displayed on the [[helmet]] and/or on an [[armband]], [[brassard]], or arm or shoulder flash. In the [[World War II|Second World War]], the military police of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] still used a metal [[gorget]] as an emblem.

Naval police members are sometimes called "[[master-at-arms|masters-at-arms]]" and [[shore patrol]].

==Americas==

===Brazil===
"[[Military Police (Brazil)|Military police]]" is a law enforcement agency which follows the Brazilian military rules,  responsible for [[Preventive police]] of the civilian population. Each state has its own Military Police department similar to a [[Gendarmerie]].

Traditional [[Provost (military police)|Provost]] duties are held by different corps within each branch of the [[Armed Forces|Brazilian Armed Forces]]: [[Army Police (Brazil)|Army Police]] ({{lang-pt|Polícia do Exército, PE}}) for the [[Brazilian Army|Army]], Navy Police ({{lang-pt|Polícia da Marinha}}) for the [[Brazilian Navy|Navy]], and Air Force Police ({{lang-pt|Polícia da Aeronáutica, PA}}) for the [[Brazilian Air Force|Air Force]].

===Canada===
[[File:MP OPD.jpg|thumb|left|Canadian Forces Military Police Domestic Operational Patrol Uniform]]
{{main|Canadian Forces Military Police}}
The '''Canadian Forces Military Police''' (CF MP) contribute to the effectiveness and readiness of the [[Canadian Forces]] (CF) and the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] (DND) through the provision of professional police, security and operational support services worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vcds-vcemd.forces.gc.ca/cfpm-gpfc/apm-agp/mv-eng.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223204854/http://www.vcds-vcemd.forces.gc.ca/cfpm-gpfc/apm-agp/mv-eng.asp |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CFMP are classified as [[Peace Officer]]s in the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]],&lt;ref name=QRO&gt;[http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/qro-orf/vol-01/tc-tm-022-eng.asp Military Police and Reports on Persons in Custody] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629170604/http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/qro-orf/vol-01/tc-tm-022-eng.asp |date=29 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives them the same powers as civilian law enforcement personnel to enforce [[Acts of Parliament]] on or in relation to DND property or assets anywhere in the world. They have the power to arrest anyone who is subject to the [[Code of Service Discipline]] (CSD), regardless of position or rank under the [[National Defence Act]] (NDA). MP have the power to arrest and charge non-CSD bound civilians only in cases where a crime is committed on or in relation to DND property or assets, or at the request of the [[Minister of Public Safety (Canada)|Minister of Public Safety]], [[Correctional Service of Canada|Commissioner of the Correctional Service of Canada]] or [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]. Although MP jurisdiction is only on DND property across Canada and throughout the world, any civilian accessing these areas falls under MP jurisdiction and are dealt with in the same manner as any civilian policing agency. If a crime is committed on or in relation to DND property or assets, MP have the power to arrest and charge the offender, military or civilian, under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]. It is important to note though that the purpose of the CFMP is not to replace the job of a civilian police officer, but rather to support the Canadian Forces through security and policing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfc.forces.gc.ca/papers/csc/csc28/mds/gale.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=6 July 2011|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706182022/http://www.cfc.forces.gc.ca/papers/csc/csc28/mds/gale.pdf|archivedate=6 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drivesmartbc.ca/police/military-police-powers|title=Military Police Powers - DriveSmartBC|website=www.drivesmartbc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; MP also have the power to enforce the Provincial Highway Traffic Acts on all military bases in Canada pursuant to the Government Property Traffic Regulations (GPTR).

===Colombia===
[[File:Military Police of Colombia.jpg|thumb|right|Military Police of Colombia during a practice event in [[Zipaquirá]], [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]].]]
In Colombia, MPs (Policia Militar in Spanish) are very common. They can be seen guarding closed roads, museums, embassies, government buildings and airports. In the [[National Army of Colombia]] they are assigned to the 37 Military Police Battalions, wearing green uniforms with the military police helmet. A Naval Police battalion is in service in the [[Colombian Marine Infantry]]. MP units also provide [[military band]]s and [[drum and bugle corps (classic)|drum and bugle corps]] for ceremonial events.

===United States===
Each branch of the [[Armed Forces of the United States]] maintains its own police force. The [[U.S. Coast Guard]], which in itself is a law enforcement agency, uses a mixture of enlisted rates and ranks qualified as law enforcement officers to patrol, investigate crimes, and enforce laws and regulations on large bases and training centers through the [[United States Coast Guard Police]]. The Coast Guard also uses the [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]], a mixture of civilian, enlisted, reservists, and officers who are qualified and duly sworn federal law enforcement officers separate from the normal Coast Guard chain of command. CGIS primarily investigates and charges those in its own population with serious crimes, such as rape, assault or forgery, that fall under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

The following is a list of military police forces:

* [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police Corps]]/[[United States Army Provost Marshal General|Office of the Provost Marshal General]]—[[United States Army]]
* [[Provost Marshal]]'s Office (base law enforcement) and Law Enforcement Battalions (combat support or "field MPs") —[[United States Marine Corps]]

* [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|Masters-at-Arms]] or MAs are [[enlisted]] [[Sailor]]s of the [[U.S. Navy]], designated as Naval Security Force (NSF), primarily responsible for law enforcement and force protection. NSF personnel are led by Naval commissioned officers from the [[Limited Duty Officer]] (LDO) and [[Chief Warrant Officer]] (CWO) communities, who are also designated as NSF. Additionally, a host installation's Security Force (both overseas and in the Continental United States) are augmented by Sailors on Temporary Assignment of Duty (TEMADD) from their parent units, as part of the Auxiliary Security Force (ASF). [[Shore Patrol]] personnel are Sailors from U.S. naval vessels visiting foreign ports (and some domestic ports) assigned to the Shore Patrol Party or Beach Guard, responsible for the good order and discipline of Sailors from the visiting ship(s) on liberty. Sailors assigned to the Shore Patrol Party or Beach Guard Detachment do not include Sailors assigned to the ship's Security Force, both performing different duties while visiting that country, because of the Status of Force Agreement (SOFA) and/or Rules of Engagement (ROE). Prior to the 1970s, Master-at-Arms and Shore Patrol were used synonymously to refer to Sailors assigned to perform law enforcement and Shore Patrol duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Master-at-Arms Community|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/enlisted/community/security/Pages/default.aspx|work=Master-at-Arms Community Manager's Page|publisher=U.S. Navy|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Air Force Security Forces]] (formerly known as Military Police, Air Police and Security Police)—[[United States Air Force]]

Each service also maintains uniformed civilian police departments. They are referred to as [[Department of Defense Police]] (DoD Police). These police fall under each directorate they work for within the [[United States Department of Defense]], for example: DoD Army or DoD Navy Police. The [[Department of the Air Force Police]] operate under the Air Provost Marshal. The police officers' duties are similar to those of local civilian police officers. They enforce the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ), [[Law of the United States|federal]] and [[U.S. state|state]] laws, and the regulations of their particular installation.

Felony level criminal investigations in the United States Armed Forces are carried out by separate agencies:

* [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Army Criminal Investigation Command]] (CID)—Army (general felony crimes)
* [[United States Army Counterintelligence|Army Counterintelligence]] (CI)—Army (national security crimes)
* [[United States Marine Corps Criminal Investigation Division|Marine Corps Criminal Investigation Division]] (CID)—Marine Corps
* [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] (NCIS)—Navy and Marine Corps
* [[Air Force Office of Special Investigations]] (OSI)—Air Force
* [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]] (CGIS)—Coast Guard

The [[Defense Criminal Investigative Service]] (DCIS) is a civilian agency that answers directly to the DOD as well as the [[Pentagon Force Protection Agency]] (PFPA).

The [[United States Constabulary]] was a gendarmerie force used to secure and patrol the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|American Zone of West Germany]] immediately after [[World War II]].

====Combat roles of the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Marine Corps Military Police====
MP's in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps, in addition to their roles as enforcers of law and order on military installations, fulfill a number of combat roles as well. Military Police in Afghanistan and Iraq have been widely employed for such duties as convoy security, mounted and dismounted patrols, maritime expeditionary warfare, [[Military Working Dog]] operations, security details for senior officers, and detainee handling.&lt;ref name="marines.mil"/&gt; Army MPs, Navy MAs, Navy Sailors who possess the Navy Enlisted Classification (NEC) Code 2008 and 9575, Navy Sailors who have completed the Individual Augmentee (IA) training for Detention Operations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Navy Individual Augmentee (IA)|url=http://www.ia.navy.mil/|publisher=U.S. Navy Bureau of Naval Personnel|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Air Force Security Forces have been widely used as [[prison guard]]s in detainee facilities, whereas Marine Corps MPs focus on securing and processing detainees before passing them on to Army holding facilities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/mil_pol_operations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/NAVMC+3500.10B_1.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=1 August 2013|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801085423/http://community.marines.mil/news/publications/Documents/NAVMC+3500.10B_1.pdf|archivedate=1 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.15thmeu.marines.mil/News/NewsArticleDisplay/tabid/8671/Article/82574/military-police-practice-detainee-handling-in-expeditionary-environment.aspx|title=Military Police practice detainee handling in expeditionary environment &gt; 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit &gt; News Article Display|date=17 February 2013|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217091746/http://www.15thmeu.marines.mil/News/NewsArticleDisplay/tabid/8671/Article/82574/military-police-practice-detainee-handling-in-expeditionary-environment.aspx|archivedate=17 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Limitation of authority and jurisdiction====
Since U.S. military police soldiers are members of the armed forces, they are prohibited from exercising [[domestic policy|domestic]] law enforcement powers under the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], a federal law passed in 1878. MPs may enforce certain limited powers, such as traffic stops, on access roads and other federal property not necessarily within the boundaries of their military base or installation. When combined, the Posse Comitatus Act and [[Insurrection Act]] place significant limits on presidential power to use the military in a law enforcement capacity.
 
The only military forces exempt from the act are the [[United States Coast Guard]], as its mission includes maritime law enforcement duties; and Army and Air [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] units while under state authority. Army and Air National Guard troops are not exempt from Posse Comitatus while they are serving under federal Title 10 orders.

[[File:Indonesian Army, Navy, and Air Force military police (Polisi Militer TNI).jpg|thumb|300px|Military policemen (Army, Navy, and Air Force) from the three services within the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] stand at attention during a ceremony]]
In [[Indonesia]], the [[Military Police Corps (Indonesia)|military police]] are known as ''Korps Polisi Militer'' (CPM) or simply ''Polisi Militer'' ('''PM'''). They are the police of the military/armed forces organization in charge of enforcing discipline and the maintenance of law and order in the [[Indonesian Armed Forces|military]] environment and for military purposes. They serve as policing units in the armed forces. The military police of Indonesia also perform duties in the area of law enforcement (including investigation of crime) involving members of the military (even in certain cases that may also involve the regular civilian police, especially if the case involves a civilian), installation of security, escort protection of senior military officers and/or important government officials such as the President and Vice President, setting and supervising prisoners of war, controlling custody of military prisoners, managing military traffic control and marking and managing routes and resupply routes for military and civilian purposes. Indonesian Military Police are identifiable with their blue berets (dragged to the left) and also wear white helmet printed '''PM''' and dark blue [[brassard]] worn on their upper left sleeve printed '''PM'''.

There are 3 military police corps in Indonesia, which are "POM-AD" (''Polisi Militer Angkatan Darat'') for policing in the [[Indonesian Army|army]], "POM-AL" (''Polisi Militer Angkatan Laut'') for policing in the [[Indonesian Navy|navy]], and "POM-AU" (''Polisi Militer Angkatan Udara'') for policing in the [[Indonesian Air Force|air force]].

[[Provost (military police)|Provosts]] or ''Provos'' in [[Indonesia]], shortened ("'''PROV'''"), secures, supervises and maintains discipline in a battalion or a regimental headquarter of the military, which is specifically different from the military police. Its area of responsibility for enforcing discipline and order is only limited to inside the military complex which it is given authority, and not beyond. It is also known as the [[Regimental Police]] in [[commonwealth]] countries. The Indonesian Provosts soldiers are usually posted at the entrances of a military base and are identifiable with their dark blue [[brassard]] printed '''PROV''' worn on their upper left sleeve.

===Iran===

===Israel===
The [[Military Police Corps (Israel)|Israeli Military Police Corps]] (''Kheil HaMishtara HaTzva'it'') is the military police/[[Provost (military police)|provost]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. It also helps monitor Israeli military prisons. At times of emergency, [[Enemy combatant|enemy]] detainees are held and sorted by the military police.

The corps has very little civilian jurisdiction and for that reason works in conjunction with the [[Israeli Police]] when civilians are involved. The [[Israel Border Police]] is Israel's [[Gendarmerie]] equivalent.

PT stands for "Polis Tentera", the Malay words for "Military Police". Military police on traffic duty wear armbands sporting the letters "MP" in red.

===Pakistan===
Since the establishment and inception of the [[Pakistan Armed Forces]], they have maintained their own military police. The Pakistan Army received its share of Muslim personnel from the former Royal Indian Military Police, forming the Pakistan Army Military Police or "MP". Later, the [[Pakistan Navy]] established the "naval police" with its centre commissioned at "PNS Nighaban", and the Pakistan Air Force later established the PAF Police to maintain order.

The [[Pakistan Navy]]'s Naval Police can be identified by their red armbands with the letters "NP" written in white. They are headquartered at [[PNS Qasim]] in Karachi.

===Belgium===
[[File:Voertuig militaire politie Nationaal Defilé 2018.jpg|thumb|Vehicle of the Belgian Military Police.]]
The [[Belgian Army]]'s Military Police Group (''Groupe Police Militaire'' in French, ''Groep Militaire Politie'' in Dutch) performs military police duties on behalf of all four components of the Belgian military. The group is headed by a [[colonel]] and has 188 members in five MP detachments. Until 1995, the Belgian [[Rijkswacht|Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie]] was, besides its civilian policing tasks, responsible for the nation's Military Police duties.

The Military Police Group staff is located in the Queen Elizabeth Barracks in the [[Brussels]] suburb of Evere. Alpha Detachment located at Evere covers the province of Flemish Brabant and the capital, Brussels. Bravo Detachment covers the Walloon Brabant, [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] and [[Namur (province)|Namur]] areas and is located at [[Nivelles]]. Charlie Detachment located at [[Marche-en-Famenne]] covers the [[Liège (province)|Liege]] and [[Luxembourg]] areas. Delta Detachment covers the [[Limbourg]] and [[Antwerp]] areas and is located at [[Leopoldsburg]]. Echo Detachment located at Lombardsijde covers Western and Eastern [[Flanders]].

The Military Police force carries out the following missions:

* Maintenance of order and discipline: Consists of monitoring, maintaining and, if necessary, re-establishing discipline and military order. This also involves controlling stragglers and refugees in times of war and guarding and escorting prisoners of war.
* Traffic regulation: Includes traffic monitoring and regulation to ensure the flow of military movements in accordance with plans. This includes route reconnaissance and marking, convoy and oversize vehicle escort and river crossing control. Traffic accident investigations is also a part of the job.
* Security missions: Prevents and deters any threat to or attack against the personnel and property of the armed forces. The Military Police force protects, for example, the Palace of the Nation and the Parliaments and Councils of the Regions and the Communities, headquarters and classified conferences. MPs also provide VIP motorcycle escorts and honour guards, perform close protection missions, and escort classified documents and money transports.

The Belgian Military Police has also taken part in multinational peacekeeping missions such as Afghanistan, Kosovo and Congo. The [[Belgian police|Federal Police’s]] Military Crime Division (DJMM) performs all investigations involving the armed forces.

In 2003, duties relating to refugees and deserters in wartime were transferred from the then disbanded RijkswachtGendarmerie to the MPs. Members of the former 4 and 6 MP Companies were merged into the new MP Group, along with some Gendarmes previously assigned MP-related duties.

Belgian MPs are identified by black armbands with the letters MP in white block letters, worn on the left arm.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Shortly after the formation of the [[Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 2005, an intentional strategy was made to limit in law and multi-ethnic, crime violation in the armed forces, so to speak, the Military Police, which was formed later on and approved by the [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

===Bulgaria===
The first documents reflecting the establishment of interior order bodies in Bulgaria are: Instruction on Establishment of Initial Military Police Governorship, dated 3 July 1877, Instruction on the Rights and Duties of the Constituted Local Police Guards, dated 19 July 1877, and Temporary Regulations on Constituting Police Voluntary Sentries and Armed Guards, dated 8 August 1877.

According to the Instruction on Military Police Governorship in the free Bulgarian lands and regions with army presence, the Military Police enforced the law and order in the rear of the army, suspended possible clashes among members of different religious communities and observed for the proper implementation of commanders instructions.

Irrespective of the military police presence in the rear of the army and troops, newly- appointed civil administrative authorities (governors) were given the right to organize mounted and infantry sentries and armed local guards.

Temporary Regulations on Gendarmerie Structure were promulgated after Prince Alexander I had suspended the Constitution of Turnovo in 1881. The gendarmerie became government guard with military organization and was tasked with maintenance of public law and order, law enforcement, and implementation of police rules issued by the authorities. The new structure was based on French and Austrian experience.

Gendarmerie Corps Chief, subordinate to the Military Minister, was empowered to act as a liaison point between the military administration and the other ministries and institutions as well as to take independent decisions on any issues within his competence. Gendarmerie units’ chiefs were independent of the provincial military chiefs and were empowered to issue orders to them.

Drafting of bodies for security and interior order was based on the necessity of mastering and integrating this activity under the Military Ministry. With Decree of the Prince No. 73/ 3 July 1882, the Gendarmerie Corps was converted into the Dragoon Corps. The intention of the military minister was to be set up a cavalry unit authorized to carry out police duties as well. Of interest is Ministerial Order No. 193/ 1882 which tasked the Dragoon Corps with specific tasks on the Ruschuk-Varna railway. Then existing Military Police Railway Command was disbanded on 1 October 1882.

The names used in the documents mentioned above, "military police governorship" and "military police command", connote the meaning and sense of the specific activities of these bodies and prove that military police history dates back to the very beginning of the Third Bulgarian State.

In 1883 started a process of purposeful legislative regulation on the activity of the police forces for public order and security and their gradual differentiation from the Military Ministry. Prince Alexander I tasked Prime Minister Dragan Tsankov with the establishment of a new police structure in Bulgaria. Its activity was to be legally based upon the Regulations on Police Guards, adopted in 1883.

In compliance with the Decree of His Highness No. 756/ 17 September 1883, the Dragoon Corps was disbanded on 1 October 1883. Its property, clothing, armament and ammunition were to be given to the Ministry of the Interior.

In the Act on the Armed Forces Regulation in the Bulgarian Principality, adopted by the Sixth Regular National Assembly on 3 December 1891, envisaged establishment of six semi-companies in stages. Each of them was to be added to a division and to be set military police tasks in wartime. Such units were not actually formed but this fact shows the political will for their creation in case of eventual military activities.

Tasks and strength of the MPs were precisely defined in the eve of the 1912 war with Turkey. A Military Police infantry platoon of 60 with an officer in charge and a mounted platoon of 50 were added to any division.  The Military Police patrolled in the troops' areas and in the rear, maintaining the order and discipline.

While Bulgaria was getting ready for the war, the Strategic Command assessed the need of military police presence in the army. In 1915 a military police sector of six squadrons was founded under the Staff of the acting army.  In the same year was issued Instruction on the Officer Qualities and Posts in the Military Police Troops. The document reads their goals: to maintain order and law in the troops’ areas and in the rear, to enforce laws, ordinances, regulations, and orders of senior commanders and chiefs. The Military Police were tasked with guarding staffs, transport, warehouses and other army installations. They were also empowered to implement specific tasks – crime investigation, protection of civilians against despoiling and abusing, fight against marauders, supervision and control over the civilians following the army and especially the unreliable and/ or espionage suspected individuals. MPs convoyed, secured refugees, prisoners-of-war, military posts and mail, collected and stored weapons left behind by its own or enemy troops, horses and other objects, checked on the regularity of troops at the railway stations.

With Ministerial Order No.160/ 20 December 1916 was promulgated Instruction on Military Police Service within First Infantry Division of Sofia. It empowered the Military Police to apprehend, subject to search, and detain any suspected individuals as well as individuals without proper documents no matter whether they were civilian or military.

In 1923 the Act on Military Police Replenishment was adopted due to the necessity of organizational and structural building of the Military Police. The criteria for personnel selection were too high for that time and met the high standards and specific requirements for performing military police duties.

In 1940 the Ministry of War issued Recommendations on the Military Police Service. Military police units were tasked with maintenance of order, morale, and discipline in the army. The Recommendations also listed a lot of measures for securing staffs, communications and messages in the rear. In the last chapter, it was emphasized that the Recommendations were valid in wartime and were to be executed on maneuvers and under martial law declared in peacetime.

The Military Police Group was set up under the Chief Army Command on 20 February 1941, shortly before Bulgaria entered World War II. Military Police School for Initial and Further Personnel Training was founded in Sofia in 1942.

The Military Police Group was transformed into the Securing Group in compliance of the Order of the Military Ministry, dated 2 September 1944. In January 1945 this Military Securing Group was disbanded and a special group for implementation of specific tasks in the army was formed. In 1946 it became regiment. In 1947 under Ordinance No. 523 of 8 April the Regiment was disbanded under the Paris Peace Treaty clauses.
 
In 1991 the Ministry of Defense tasked the General Staff with the planning of the Military Police organization and structure in order to re-establish the service. A few months later, on 5 November 1991 the Ministerial Council issued Decree No. 217 which proclaimed the establishment of the Military Police – based on regional principle, part of the Bulgarian Army, and to meet the needs of the Armed Forces, troops, ministries, administrations, and Civil Defense of the Republic of Bulgaria.

The Military Police units are specialized bodies under the Minister of Defense for the purposes of law enforcement, prevention and disclosure of crimes and other violations, maintenance of army order and discipline within garrisons, control over army transport and protection of legal interests and rights of the Bulgarian Army personnel.

The Military Police, due to the required specific knowledge, experience and skills, had become professional ten years earlier before the Bulgarian Army abolished conscription. The Military Police gradually turns into a modern NATO-modelled formation.

With Order of the Minister of Defense No. OX-0082/ 29 January 1998 the Military Police Administration – GS was transferred from its immediate subordination to the Chief of the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army to subordination to the Minister of Defense.

On 2 December 1999 with Ministerial Order No. 985 was founded the Security Service – Military Police and Military Counterintelligence under the Minister of Defense. It was the successor to the then existing administrations MPs and MCI.

On 1 April 2008, as a result of reformation of the national security system, the Military Counterintelligence passed to the newly founded State Agency National Security. The Security Service – Military Police and Military Counterintelligence was transformed into the Military Police Service under the Minister of Defense.

The fifth of November has been announced the Military Police Service Celebration Day with Order of the Minister of Defense No. OX-708/ 10 October 2008.

The current chief of the Bulgarian Military Police Service is Brigadier General Borislav Sertov.

===Croatia===
[[File:Military Police Member (Croatian Army).jpg|thumb|upright|Croatian MP in uniform]]

The [[Croatia]]n Military Police ({{lang-hr|Vojna policija}}) is a part of the [[Croatian Armed Forces]] ({{lang|hr|Oružane snage Republike Hrvatske}}). The Croatian Military Police was formed on 27 August 1991, shortly after the [[Croatian National Guard|National Guard Corps]] ({{lang|hr|Zbor narodne garde}})--now the [[Croatian Army]]—was formed.

Parts of Croatian Military Police are:
* NSVP - Military Police Education center "Bojnik Alfred Hill"
* 66th Military Police Battalion
* 67th Military Police Battalion
* 68th Military Police Battalion
* 69th Military Police Company
* 70th Military Police Company
* 71st Military Police Battalion
* 72nd Military Police Battalion
* 73rd Military Police Battalion (HRM (Croatian Navy))
* 74th Military Police Company (HRZ (Croatian Air Force))
* 75th Military Police Battalion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vojska.net/|title=Vojska.net - strategy, wargaming, military history website|first=Ivan|last=Bajlo|website=webarchive.loc.gov|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110404212255/http://www.vojska.net/|archivedate=4 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech Republic===
[[File:Land Rover Defender Military Police.JPG|thumb|left|Vehicle of Czech Military police]]

The {{ill|Military Police Corps (Czech Republic)|cz|Vojenská policie}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.cz/scripts/detail.php?id=6223/|title=Špatná zpráva|website=www.army.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Czech language|Czech]] ''vojenská policie'') was set up on 21 January 1991. Within the provisions of the Czech Law No. 124/1992 Dig. regarding the Military Police, they are responsible for police protection of armed forces, military facilities, military material and other state property controlled by the Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic. The Military Police are a professional force.

The Military Police are headed by a Chief,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.cz/scripts/detail.php?id=6257/|title=Špatná zpráva|website=www.army.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; who directly reports to the Minister of Defence.

As of 1 July 2003, the Military Police officers are equipped with accessories black in colour, including their distinctive feature – the black beret.

The structure is based on the territorial principle. The Military Police subordinated headquarters are located in Prague, Stará Boleslav, Tábor, and Olomouc.

Military police officers are assigned directly to military units, and they form also part of military contingents of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic in foreign deployments.
Foreign Deployments:

The military police officers serve within contingents of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic on foreign operations on the territory of Iraq and on the Balkans, and as of March 2007 its Special Operation Group (SOG) also in southern Afghanistan in the Helmand Province.

===Denmark===
[[File:Danish military police Mercedes.JPG|thumb|Danish navy military police [[Mercedes-Benz Viano]]]]

In Denmark the military police (Danish: ''militærpoliti'') services are carried out as independent units under each branch. In the [[Royal Danish Army|army]] all military police tasks are done as an integral part of the ''[[Trænregimentet]]'',
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militarypolice.dk/hls/HRN_MP_2003.pdf Hærens militærpoliti] (in Danish) (Military police of the army)&lt;/ref&gt; 
whereas the [[Royal Danish Navy|navy]] military police is an independent unit under command and control of the commanding officer of the [[Danish Frogman Corps]]
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.forsvaret.dk/omos/Publikationer/Documents/Fakta%20om%20Forsvaret_DK.pdf Fakta om Forsvaret] (in Danish) (Facts about the Defence) {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619021047/http://www2.forsvaret.dk/omos/Publikationer/Documents/Fakta%20om%20Forsvaret_DK.pdf |date=19 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and the [[Royal Danish Air Force|air force]], as a part of the force protection squadron (''Squadron 660'') of the air force ''Combat Support Wing''.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://forsvaret.dk/CSW/NytogPresse/NyhedsArkiv/Pages/MPharmangefunktioner.aspx Militærpolitiet har mange funktioner] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801075244/http://forsvaret.dk/CSW/NytogPresse/NyhedsArkiv/Pages/MPharmangefunktioner.aspx |date=1 August 2013 }} (in Danish) (''The military police has many tasks'')&lt;/ref&gt; 
Unlike the two other branches, the navy military police also handles installation guard duties (which is carried out by regular soldiers in the army and by an installation protection unit under ''Squadron 660'' in the air force) of naval installations as well as certain military installations in the Danish capital region, such as the [[Defence Command (Denmark)|Danish Defence Command]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]].

MP personnel typically wear either branch-specific display dress uniforms with white shoulder markings with the text ''MP'' or the branch-common daily [[Uniforms of the Royal Danish Army#M/11|combat uniform]], with a red [[beret]]. In the air force the MP-shoulder markings is typically replaced with markings saying either ''VAGT'' or ''GUARD'', but for international missions they also use the ''MP''-markings.

MP personnel generally do not have legal authority over civilians in non-military areas but only over military personnel and on military installations (also publicly accessible places like [[Holmen naval base]] in [[Copenhagen]]). On some occasions MP personnel can support civilian police in certain tasks, but will only have slightly more legal authority than civilians—similar to the police home guard.

In the army military police are almost without exception [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] or [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]], whereas the navy and air force rely mainly of [[Other ranks, Denmark|Danish ranks OR-1 to OR-3]].

Furthermore, the [[Danish Home Guard|home guard]] has a police branch, which supports both the civilian [[Police of Denmark|Danish police]] and the military police.

Typical MP jobs are:
* Installation/perimeter guard
* Personnel protection
* Traffic control
* Courier services
* Prisoner transport

===Estonia===
The ''[[Military Police (Estonia)|Sõjaväepolitsei]]'' are the Military Police of the Estonian Defence Forces.[http://www.mil.ee] The Estonian MP organization was created in 1994 and is today divided into tactical (patrol) and investigative units. Additionally, conscript-based reserve MP platoons are trained in Guard Battalion every year. MP tasks include investigation of serious disciplinary cases and some armed service-related crimes, supervision of military discipline within the Forces, military traffic control and various security tasks. Within conflict/crises areas (Afghanistan) the MP may provide close protection of the Estonian national representative and other visiting VIPs. When on regular patrol assignment, Estonian MPs wear a black brassard on their right shoulder, with the letters ''SP'' in silver, and are usually equipped with an HK USP 9&amp;nbsp;mm pistol, spare magazines, radio, handcuffs, pepper spray and an expandable police baton.

===Finland===
[[File:Sotilaspoliisi.jpg|thumb|MP car in [[Helsinki]]]]
The ''{{ill|Sotilaspoliisi|fi}}'' (literally, "Soldier Police") are the military police of the [[Finnish Defence Forces]]. The Finnish MPs wear a black brassard on the left shoulder with the letters 'SP' in white. A military policeman is usually armed with a 9&amp;nbsp;mm pistol, a baton, pepper spray and handcuffs on his belt. The military police includes both career and conscript personnel, and is primarily used to guard military installations and supervise military traffic. All military police personnel are trained with basic police techniques and usually receive training for [[Urban combat|fighting in urban areas]]. In wartime, the tasks are more extensive and include protection of key personnel and targets, especially against enemy special forces, and surveillance, control, pursuit, arrest and destruction missions. For training, almost all brigades have military police companies. The companies are part of and subordinate to the brigade.

The military police has jurisdiction over military personnel, military areas, installations and exercise areas. However, a military police patrol may stop a crime that it witnesses in process in a civilian area. Additionally, if a military police unit is near to a serious crime taking place, such as a robbery or an assault, and the civilian police are delayed, a military police unit that is near to the scene can offer to handle the situation until the civilian police arrive. As with some other Finnish Defence Forces units, the military police can be used to provide assistance to the civilian police when they are undermanned or lack special resources. In such case, the military police may take measures deemed necessary by the civilian police. For example, during the 2005 Helsinki World Athletic Championship Games, military police conscripts and career personnel were placed along the [[marathon]] route to prevent the large numbers of spectators from obstructing the runners.

Before and during [[World War II]], Finland did not have military police in peacetime, but only temporary ''sotapoliisi'' ("war police"). Ex-police officers were conscripted for police officer duty in the armed forces; usually only the officers had police training. Planning for ''sotapoliisi'' was still unfinished at the break of war, so regular reservists could not be conscripted. Thus personnel had to be recruited without regard to quality; conscripts found unfit for field duty for e.g. health reasons, and even those with previous criminal record were recruited, and the reputation suffered.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110706131103/http://www.hum.utu.fi/oppiaineet/suomenhistoria/julkaisut/progradut/?id=599]&lt;/ref&gt; 
For a long time, ''sotapoliisi'' existed only in wartime. However, improvement to this came eventually: the military police school was founded in 1963, and civilian police background was no longer required.

The crimes committed by military personnel are, as a rule, investigated by the military. Minor infractions are usually investigated by the career personnel of the unit, while more serious crimes are investigated by the investigative section of the General Staff of the Finnish Defence Forces. In minor matters, the company commander or his superiors may use disciplinary powers, but more serious cases are deferred to the civilian prosecutor who will take the case to the district court.

===France===
[[File:Hortefeux law demonstrations Paris 20th October 2007 9217a.jpg|thumb|Gendarme mobile]]
The ''[[French Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie Nationale]]'' acts as both the military police and one of the two national law enforcement forces of [[France]].
Provost missions are assumed by local units for the garrisons of the [[Armée de terre|Ground Army]] on French soil and by special divisions : 
* The 1100 members of the ''[[Gendarmerie Navale]]'' (also called the ''[[Gendarmerie Maritime]]'') police the [[French Navy|Navy]] (and also acts as a [[coast guard]] and [[water police]] force). National critical merchant ports are protected by specialized units of the Gendarmerie Navale, the [[Pelotons de Sécurité Maritime et Portuaire|Naval and Harbor Safety Platoons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gendarmerie.interieur.gouv.fr/Notre-institution/Nos-composantes/Gendarmeries-specialisees/Gendarmerie-maritime&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 860 members of the ''[[Gendarmerie de l'Air]]'' polices the [[French Air Force|Air Force]] fulfills police and security missions in the air bases, and goes on the site of an accident involving military aircraft. This branch is separate from the ''[[Air Transport Gendarmerie]]'' (Gendarmerie des Transports Aériens), which is placed under the dual supervision of the Gendarmerie and the direction of civilian aviation and fulfills police and security missions in civilian airfields and airports. They also perform immigration and emigration checks on military flights.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gendarmerie.interieur.gouv.fr/Notre-institution/Nos-composantes/Gendarmeries-specialisees/Gendarmerie-de-l-air&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 280 personnel of the ''Ordnance Gendarmerie (Gendarmerie de l'Armement)'' fulfill police and security missions in the establishments of the [[Délégation Générale pour l'Armement]] (France's defence procurement agency) and ensure VIP close-protection for the head of the DGA and a few other high-rankings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gendarmerie.interieur.gouv.fr/Notre-institution/Nos-composantes/Gendarmeries-specialisees/La-gendarmerie-de-l-Armement&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 50 members of the ''[[Gendarmerie de la Sécurité des Armements Nucléaires|Gendarmerie of the Safety of Nuclear Armaments]], backed by 250 members of the ''Mobile Gendarmerie'' monitor all the nuclear armaments of the French Republic.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gendarmerie.interieur.gouv.fr/Notre-institution/Nos-composantes/Gendarmeries-specialisees/Gendarmerie-de-la-securite-des-armements-nucleaires-Gsan&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 70 members of the ''[[Gendarmerie Prévôtale|Provost Gendarerie (Gendarmerie Prévôtale)]]'' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/operations/la-gendarmerie-prevotale&lt;/ref&gt; conduct judiciary and disciplinary investigations in foreign garrisons.[[File:Juillet 2013 - brassard prévôté afghanistan.jpg|thumb|Armband of the Afghani detachment]]

The Gendarmerie Navale, Gendarmerie de l'Air, Ordnance Gendarmerie and Provost Gendarmerie are placed under the dual supervision of the Gendarmerie and the relevant military branch. However, for judiciary duties, they are under exclusive command of the relevant court.

In addition to the Gendarmerie, ''[[Fusiliers Marins|Naval Fusiliers (Fusiliers Marins)]]'', ''[[Fusiliers Commandos de l'Air|Fusilier commandos of the Air Force (Fusiliers Commandos de l'Air)]]'' and dedicated regimental platoons maintain order for their respective branches.

===Germany===
[[File:BW Barettabzeichen Feldjäger.png|thumb|150px|left|Current badge of the [[Feldjäger]]]]
[[File:MB461 LAPV Enok Mil Police German Service.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A [[LAPV Enok]] armored vehicle of the [[Feldjäger]]]]
[[File:Feldgendarmerie.JPG|thumb|150px|Duty [[gorget]] of the WWII Feldgendarmerie]]

During [[World War II]], [[Germany]] had numerous military police units. The primary units were the ''[[Feldgendarmerie]]'', which comprised members of the ''Gendarmerie''. Other units included the Army Patrol Service (''Heeres-Streifendienst''), the Train Station Guards ([[Wehrmachtstreifendienst]]), and the ''[[Feldjägerkorps]]''. Criminal investigations were conducted by the [[Geheime Feldpolizei]] or Secret Field Police.

The ''[[Feldjäger]]'' are the current military police of the German ''[[Bundeswehr]]''. The term ''Feldjäger'' ("field rifleman" or "field hunter") has a long tradition and dates back to the mid-17th century. Their motto is ''Suum Cuique'' ("To each his own", derived from [[Cicero]], ''De Finibus, Bonorum et Malorum'', ''liber V'', 67: "''(...) ut fortitudo in laboribus periculisque cernatur, (...), iustitia in'' suo cuique ''tribuendo.''").

===Greece===
[[File:FestivalVirginMaryKremasti (2).JPG|thumb|left|Men of the Greek military police (''Stratonomia'')]]

The paramilitary [[Greek Gendarmerie]] fulfilled most security and order duties in Greece until [[World War II]]. In 1951, Law 1746/51 established the framework of the [[Hellenic Army]]'s [[Greek Military Police]] ({{lang-el|Ελληνική Στρατιωτική Αστυνομία or ΕΣΑ}}, ''Ellinikí Stratiotikí Astynomía''). The organization—and particularly its Special Interrogative Department, EAT-ESA—became notorious for its brutality during the 1967–1974 [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|military junta]]. Law 276/76 renamed it simply to "Military Police" (Στρατονομία). Corresponding organizations exist also for other two branches of the Greek armed forces: for the [[Hellenic Air Force]] (Αερονομία, ''Aeronomia''), founded in 1945 as the Greek Air Force Police (Ελληνική Αεροπορική Αστυνομία, ΕΑΑ), and for the [[Hellenic Navy]] (Ναυτονομία, ''Naftonomia'', properly Υπηρεσία Ναυτονομίας or Y.ΝΑ.)

These three forces work together often but are independent from each other. Most of the personnel are draftee soldiers undergoing their regular military service.
{{clearleft}}

===Ireland===
The [[Póilíní Airm|Irish Military Police]] (colloquially "PA"s, deriving from the official title, ''[[Póilíní Airm]]'') are responsible for the prevention and detection of crime in the [[Irish Defence Forces]]. Entry to the PA is restricted to serving members of the Defence Forces. All members of the Corps are NCOs, with Officers being transferred in for temporary assignments. Unlike many Military Police Services, they retain responsibility for controlling access to many, but not all, military posts. In addition, they provide a military detachment to the [[Oireachtas]] (Houses of Parliament) and have a large ceremonial role. In the past they had a role in training armed elements of the [[Garda Síochána]] but in recent times this has decreased. Historically, they were responsible for detaining political prisoners in [[military prison]]s (until the handing over of Military Prisons at Cork, Spike Island, Arbour Hill and the Curragh to the Civil Authorities) and in the past occasionally provided firing squads for executions (the last time being the "Emergency" period of 1939-1946).

===Italy===
[[File:2june 2007 438.jpg|thumb|Italian [[Carabinieri]] with the MP uniform]]
The ''[[Arma dei Carabinieri]]'' is a gendarmerie force acting as both the military police and one of the five national police forces in [[Italy]]. Formed on 13 July 1814, it has been for almost two centuries the senior branch of the Italian Army, until on 5 October 2000 it became a fully independent Service of the Italian military.

With a strength of about 120,000, the Arma dei Carabinieri is a very large organization, including its own air and naval services, but most of its personnel is used for civilian police duties.

The properly Military Police components of the Arma dei Carabinieri are grouped into the "Divisione Unità Mobili Carabinieri" ([[Carabinieri Mobile Units Division]]), organized as follows:

2nd Brigade:
* 1st Carabinieri Parachutist Regiment "Tuscania".
* 7th Carabinieri Battalion "Trentino - Alto Adige".
* 13th Carabinieri Battalion "Friuli - Venezia Giulia".
* Gruppo Intervento Speciale.

From these units are drawn most of the elements that form the Carabinieri MP coys, platoons and detachments assigned to all the major Italian Army, Navy and Air Force units, as well as many of the personnel forming the MSU Regiments (Multinational Specialist Units) and the IPUs (Integrated Police Units) serving abroad in support of European Union, NATO and United Nation missions. The Arma dei Carabinieri have gained a very good reputation for the professionalism and organization of their MP units in support of international missions, so much that during the 2004 G8 Sea Island Conference the Carabinieri have been tasked to organize and run the CoESPU (Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units), to centralize the training of multinational MP units for international missions.

The 1st Brigade of the same "Divisione Unità Mobili Carabinieri", organized on 11 Mobile battalions and 1 Cavalry Regiment, does contribute to form the same Military Police components as the 1st Brigade, but is mostly tasked to riot control civilian police duties. It is worth to note that inside each of its battalions there is usually a small Mechanized company, so in case of war they are likely to be mobilized for combat duties (as happened during both World Wars).

The ''[[Guardia di Finanza]]''  acts as a specialized Military Police force when called upon. Its normal duties include being a force acting in border control, customs duties, and police investigations into financial crimes and illegal drug trafficking.

===NATO===
During the Cold War the approach of [[NATO]] to military policing was to provide military police support to national forces in terms of:
&lt;ref&gt;[http://forcespublishing.co.uk/pages/army_publications_pages/royal_military_police.html The Royal Military Police Journal April 2007](none digital)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Traffic control
* Military security
* Law and order

After the cold war, this has now evolved into:

* Mobility support
* Security
* Policing
* Detention

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]], the function of military police is performed by the ''[[Koninklijke Marechaussee]]'' ("Royal Constabulary"), a separate branch of the [[Military of the Netherlands|military]] independent of the [[Royal Netherlands Army|Army]], [[Royal Netherlands Navy|Navy]] and [[Royal Netherlands Air Force|Air Force]]. Besides performing military duties, the ''Marechaussee'' is also a gendarmerie force.

The word ''[[marshal|Marechaussee]]'' seems to derive from the old French name ''Marecheaux'' given to an ancient court of justice in Paris called the "Tribunal of Constables and Marshals of France". These constables and marshals were to become members of the Gendarmerie, which served as a model for the police forces of both Belgium and the Netherlands. The term ''Marechaussee'' was also used for the [[Continental Army]]'s military police during the [[American Revolution]].

===Norway===
[[File:Norway military police cars new livery.JPG|thumb|right|[[Volkswagen Passat]]s of the Norwegian military police]]
In [[Norway]], military police are service members of the [[Norwegian Army]], [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] or [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]]. Since about 2002, all are trained at [[Sessvollmoen Camp]]. MPs in the Army are assigned to the Military Police Battalion, located at Bardufoss, [[Troms]] county. The first battalion commander and Provost Marshal of 6. division Norwegian Army was Maj M Langvik, the current [[battalion]] commander is Lieutenant Colonel Jan Henry Norvalls. The battalion consists of approximately 50 officers and NCOs, and 150 privates and corporals. Norwegian MPs first go through a six-month selection/educational period, before being assigned to the battalion or to regimental duties with other units for the remainder of their twelve-month service. Norwegian MPs do not have authority over civilians, except on or in the vicinity of military installations, vehicles or other property or under [[martial law]]. They do have authority over military personnel, including in certain circumstances reservists, anywhere, including when such personnel are off duty.

The ''[[Norwegian Home Guard|Heimevernet]]'' ("Home Guard") also has MPs in its ranks. Usually each District (regiment) has one or two platoons, consisting exclusively of former regular or conscript military police personnel.

Norwegian MPs wear a red beret and a red lanyard around the left shoulder extending to the left front pocket. Only personnel currently serving as MPs are allowed to wear this. When on official duty, they also wear the MP armband, which is black with "MP" in red letters. It was previously worn on the right shoulder but is now worn on the left shoulder, following [[NATO]] practice. They can also wear white webbing, or a number of items for special duties, like high visibility vests for traffic duty, or as mounted personnel while performing motorcycle escort for the Royal Family or their official guests, etc.

Army canine units are also assigned to the MP battalion, but the personnel in such units are not necessarily MPs. Such personnel do not hold military police authority, and do not wear the MP insignia.

MPs have no other powers over civilians than ordinary members of the public, except inside, or in the immediate vicinity of military installations. More serious cases, like narcotics, are handed over to civilian police for investigation.

===Poland===
The [[Military Gendarmerie]] (''Żandarmeria Wojskowa'', ŻW) are the MPs for the entire [[Polish Armed Forces|Polish military]].

===Portugal===
[[File:Yamaha TDM 900 Army Police.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yamaha TDM 900]] of the Portuguese Army Police]]

In [[Portugal]], each branch of the Armed Forces has its own military police force. The [[Portuguese Navy]] has the ''Polícia Naval'' (Naval Police), the [[Portuguese Army]] has the ''[[Army Police (Portugal)|Polícia do Exército]]'' (Army Police), and the [[Portuguese Air Force]] has the ''[[Polícia Aérea]]'' (Air Police). The Air Police is an arm of its own inside the Air Force, but the Army Police is only a speciality of the [[cavalry]] arm and the Naval Police is a unit of the Marine Corps (''[[Portuguese Marines|Fuzileiros]]''). A military criminal investigation police, common for the three branches of Armed Forces, also exists, this being the ''Polícia Judiciária Militar'' (Military Judiciary Police), that is under the direct dependency of the [[Ministry of National Defence (Portugal)|Minister of National Defense]].

Portugal, also, has a gendarmerie type force, the ''[[Guarda Nacional Republicana]]'' (GNR, National Republican Guard), that is a special corps of troops that executes both civil public security missions and military missions. In time of peace, GNR is under operational command of the Minister of Internal Affairs, but in time of war it can be put under the command of the Armed Forces. GNR is not tasked with enforcing the law within the Armed Forces.

Included in the Portuguese Navy organization also exist two special police forces. The first one is the ''Polícia Maritima'' (Maritime Police), that serves as a coast guard and maritime law enforcement agency in the scope of the civil role of the Portuguese Navy as the National Maritime Authority. The other one is the ''Polícia dos Estabelecimentos da Marinha'' (Navy's Establishments Police), a small gendarmerie type agency responsible for guarding the [[Lisbon Naval Base]] and some other naval facilities.

===Romania===
{{main|Romanian Military Police}}
In [[Romania]], the [[Romanian Military Police]] (''Poliția Militară'') carries out police duties for the [[Romanian Armed Forces]]. It usually handles military security and military crimes and it has national jurisdiction. The Romanian military police is organized in four battalions (two of them are headquartered in [[Bucharest]], one in [[Iași]] and one in [[Târgu Mureș]]).

The [[Jandarmeria Română|Romanian Gendarmerie]], although a military force with national jurisdiction, is not tasked with enforcing the law within the armed forces (in contrast to the French Gendarmerie, which acts as both military and national police force).

===Russia===
The [[Russian Military Police]] (Военная полиция России) are the MPs for the entire Russian military. They carry out police duties for the [[Russian Armed Forces]].

Former military police organisations were the [[Commandant's Service]] (Военная комендатура) and Military Automobile Inspection (Военная автомобильная инспекция (ВАИ)).

===Serbia===
([[Serbian Latin|Latin]]: Vojna Policija, [[Serbian Cyrillic|Cyrillic]]: Војна полиција)  The Military Police are considered to be among the best qualified and most combat-prepared organizations within the [[Military of Serbia|Serbian military]]. Their responsibilities include counterterrorist operations, combating organized crime, close protection, securing hostages and search and rescue.

Specific training is provided for members of special units of the Military Police. Drills for Military Police units, from squad to battalion, are based on their anticipated tactical employment, including training in putting down civil disorder.
The Military Police Directorate of the [[Serbian General Staff|General Staff]] of the Serbian Military is responsible for overseeing the units of the Military Police.

===Spain===
[[File:Emblem of the Spanish Civil Guard.svg|right|100px|thumb|Emblem of the Spanish Civil Guard]]
[[File:Emblem and Badge of the Spanish Army Military Police.svg|100px|thumb|Emblem and badge of the Spanish Army Military Police]]

Each branch of the Spanish Armed Forces (Army, Navy and Air Force) has its own military police (Policia Militar, Policia Naval y Policia Aerea respectively). They are only recognized as constabularies with jurisdiction over military installations and military personnel. They have no jurisdiction over civilians off of military installations. They are also in charge of the security of military installations, play a role as bodyguards of generals, admirals and other relevant military personnel, provide security services to military transports and police military personnel abroad.

The Civil Guard (in Spanish [[Guardia Civil]]) is the Spanish gendarmerie force. Along with their civilian law enforcement functions, due to their military nature the Civil Guard is also assigned several functions as a Military Police under the Minister of Defence, the most important of which is Criminal Investigations in military facilities and vessels, other MP functions include traffic and customs enforcement in international missions.

===Soviet Union===
The [[Soviet Armed Forces]] did not have any units technically named 'military police'. Two separate agencies handled military police duties on a day-to-day basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.mweb.co.za/re/redcap/pact-mp.htm|title=Warsaw Pact "Military Police"|first=Simon|last=Olley|website=home.mweb.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Komendantskaya sluzhba'' or "[[Commandant's Service]]" of the [[Soviet Army]] wore a yellow letter "K" on a red patch on the sleeve to indicate their membership of this service—the "de facto" army police.

A second organisation called the [[Traffic Guard|Traffic Regulators]] existed within the [[Rear Services of the Armed Forces of Russia|Rear Services]]. Traffic Regulators served to control military highway and motor vehicle traffic. Traffic Regulators also wear a white painted helmet with red stripes to indicate their status and either an armband ar patch with the Cyrillic letter "P" (R).

In the [[Soviet Navy]] and (later in the present day [[Russian Navy]]) the role of [[Provost (military police)|Naval provosts]] was primarily filled by personnel from the [[Naval Infantry (Russia)|Naval Infantry]].

===Sweden===
The Swedish military police are part of the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards]], stationed in Stockholm. There are two MP companies, the 14th and the 15th companies. The 14th MP company serve a so-called GSS/T contract (two years of service over a period of eight years, the remaining time the soldiers can have a civilian job or study) and the 15th MP company serve a so-called GSS/K contract (hired continually for eight years). The Life Guards are also the seat of the Swedish military police unit (''MP-enheten'') which is responsible for the education of new MPs and is in charge of all MP activities in Sweden. Part of 13th security battalion, which is a counter-intelligence battalion, is also part of the Life Guards and has some soldiers who are trained MPs (mostly corporals and sergeants).

===Switzerland===
In the [[Swiss Armed Forces]], the Military Police is responsible for law enforcement on military property and for all incidents where military personnel or equipment is involved. Furthermore, the military police provides protection of Swiss representatives abroad and is in part responsible for the guarding of embassies and foreign VIPs in [[Switzerland]], as well as maintaining personal security for members of the [[Swiss Federal Council]]. In addition, the Swiss [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] Center is a branch of the MP for the disposal of [[unexploded ordnance]] and also participates in various [[demining]] operations around the world.

The professional MP units comprise 758 officers and are divided into four Regions, each consisting of two companies and additional groups specialised on criminal investigations and training. In addition, there are two militia MP battalions with a head count of roughly 2000 men.

Unlike regular army personnel, military policemen wear grey uniforms in order to provide distinct identification. Moreover, the MP is equipped uniquely, armed with [[SIG Pro]] side arms and [[SIG 552]] assault rifles (compared to the standard issue [[SIG P220]] pistol and [[SIG 550]] assault rifle). Professional MP units drive [[Police car|patrol cars]] similar to those of the [[Cantonal police|civilian police]], but also use [[MOWAG Piranha|Piranha]] and [[MOWAG Duro|Duro]] [[Armoured personnel carrier|APCs]].

===Ukraine===
The [[Ukrainian Military Police]] (VSP) is the military police for the [[Military of Ukraine|Ukrainian Armed Forces]]

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom the term ''' 'Military Police' ''' usually refers to the [[Royal Military Police]].  The Royal Military Police is the branch of the Adjutant General's Corps, responsible for policing the British Army (both in the United Kingdom and overseas).

The term ''' 'Service Police' ''' is often used to describe the three separate police organisations for each of the three branches of the UK's Armed Forces:

* The [[Royal Navy]] is policed by the [[Royal Navy Police]] (RNP), the members of which are traditionally known as Regulators (or [[Master-at-Arms]] if a [[Chief Petty Officer]] or [[Warrant Officer]]).
:The Royal Navy Police also provides [[Royal Marines]] specialising as service policemen. Prior to 2009, the [[Royal Marines Police]] was an independent organisation.

* The [[British Army]] is policed by the [[Royal Military Police]] (RMP).
:In addition to the Royal Military Police, most British Army units have their own [[Regimental Provost]] (RP) staff. Sometimes incorrectly referred to as Regimental Police, they do not have any police powers or policing function, but are soldiers responsible for discipline within their own units. They are normally located in the Guardroom.

* The [[Royal Air Force]] is policed by the [[Royal Air Force Police]] (RAFP). The RAFP provides not only a full Policing function, but they also fulfil a security and counter intelligence function for the RAF and the wider defence community.

In addition, each of the three service police has its own [[Special Investigation Branch]] (SIB) to undertake investigation of more serious crime and plain-clothes investigations, and use the joint [[Service Police Crime Bureau]] operated by the RNP, RMP and RAFP.

==Oceania==

===Australia===
[[File:2005-2008 Toyota Hilux (KUN16R) SR 4-door cab chassis (Military Police).jpg|thumb|right|Military Police vehicle in Australia]]

The 1st Military Police Battalion (1 MP Bn) is the field component of the Military Police and the Domestic Policing Unit (DPU) is the garrison policing component. In the [[Australian Army]], the [[Royal Australian Corps of Military Police]] also performs the role of a secondary communications network in the front battle zone. Army MP’s wear a red shoulder patch with MP in black.
In the [[Royal Australian Navy]], the [[Naval Police Coxswain Branch]] performs dual roles of performing general police duties, investigation of criminal offences and a secondary role of ships' coxswain staff responsible for administration of ships' personnel. 
In the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], the Air Force Police perform the military police role. The Air Force Police organisation falls within Security Forces, therefore their role is largely providing force protection and enforcing military and civilian laws. Air Force Police members wear either a black brassard or patch with white SP meaning Service Police.

Service Police is the term used to describe all three services policing agencies.

The Royal Australian Corps of Military Police train their own working dogs for a more Infantry/combat role.

All major crimes committed by or against personnel of the Australian Defence Force are investigated by the [[Australian Defence Force Investigative Service]].

===New Zealand===

====New Zealand Defence Force Military Police====
The New Zealand Defence Force Military Police (NZDF MP) is a tri-service Military Police unit formed on 1 December 2014. The three Military Police units from the Navy, Army, and Air Force were amalgamated to form the tri service NZDF MP.

The New Zealand Defence Force Military Police comprises military police personnel from the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]], [[New Zealand Army]], and the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]]. Personnel still maintain their own single service identity but operate under a single [[Provost Marshal]] and investigate offences against the Armed Forces Discipline Act 1971.

The New Zealand Defence Force Military Police operates outside of the normal Navy, Army and Air Force command structure. The current [[Provost Marshal]] is a [[Group Captain]] who reports directly to the [[Vice Chief]] of the [[NZDF]].

[[File:New Zealand military police 02.JPG|thumb|right|The "MP" patch identifies this woman as being a member of the New Zealand Defence Force Military Police.]]

====Serious Investigations Branch==== 
For all serious and complex investigations that are outside the scope of regular Military Police personnel a specialised unit known as the Serious Investigations Branch (SIB) handles all high-profile investigations. SIB personnel attend courses with the [[New Zealand Police]] [[Criminal Investigation Branch]]. SIB have a similar role to the [[Australian Defence Force Investigative Service]] (ADFIS). SIB are also seconded to the NZ Police [[Criminal Investigation Branch|CIB]].

New Zealand Defence Force Military Police also provide the close protection function for the [[NZDF]]. Only personnel from within the unit are able to attend the Tier 1 course and undergo a rigorous selection process. From time to time [[NZ Police]] officers from the [[Diplomatic Protection Squad]] and the [[Armed Offenders Squad]] have been known to also complete the course.

New Zealand Defence Force Military Police also complete NZ Police courses such as Urgent Duty Driving, Disaster Victim Identification, Basic and Intermediate Crash Investigation with the [[NZ Police]] [[Serious Crash Unit]], and the [[Diplomatic Protection Squad]] training course.

New Zealand Defence Force Military Police are responsible for all detainee handling both in peacetime and in an operational environment such as custody and escort of [[POW]]s. Military Police are responsible for maintaining discipline at the Services Correction Establishment (SCE) which is located at [[Burnham Military Camp]]. SCE is the [[NZDF]] Military Prison and consists of guards who are all serving members of the NZDF MP.  The guards are responsible for rehabilitation of service personnel who have been sent to the facility as a result of serious offences committed against the Armed Forces Discipline Act 1971.

All New Zealand Defence Force Military Police are identifiable by the blue and white "MP" patch they wear on their uniform and the blue beret as head dress, the wearing of the [[Blue beret]] differs from many commonwealth military police units as traditionally a [[red beret]] is worn.

'''Mining law''' is the branch of [[law]] relating to the legal requirements affecting [[mineral]]s and [[mining]]. Mining law covers &lt;section begin=overview /&gt;&lt;!--This paragraph is transcluded to [[Environmental law]] --&gt; several basic topics, including the ownership of the mineral resource and who can work them. Mining is also affected by various regulations regarding the health and safety of miners, as well as the environmental impact of mining.&lt;section end=overview /&gt;

==Topics==

===Ownership===
{{main article|mineral rights}}
An aspect of [[property law]] that is central to mining law is the question of who "owns" the mineral, such that they may legally extract it from the earth. This is often dependent on the type of mineral in question, the mining history of the jurisdiction, as well as the general background legal tradition and its treatment of property.

For instance, in many jurisdictions, rights to mine gold and silver are retained by the [[head of state|sovereign]], as the two metals traditionally served as currency in many a given society.
&lt;!--trying to find cites that this is indeed mining law, and not a separate law of mines===Regulation===
In addition to determining the property rights associated with mining, there are numerous aspectes of regulatory law that specifically address issues in mining operations. These include regulating the health and safety conditions of those working in mines, the environmental impact of mining operations, as well as the problem of [[subsidence]] (when the surface collapses into a mined-out area, often damaging buildings and structures on the surface).--&gt;

===Support===
{{main article|lateral and subjacent support}}
In addition to ownership of the mineral, the method of extraction may affect nearby property owners. [[Subsidence]] (be it dramatic or subtle) results when a mine (or similar area) collapses or drops, causing above or nearby structures to drop with it, often damaging or destroying them. The issue of support rights determines the legal rights and relationships between parties in these situations.

==By country==
Mining law varies both by the legal tradition of the jurisdiction, as well as the individual jurisdiction.

=== Mining law in German-speaking countries ===
Mining law in Europe originated from [[medieval]] [[common law]]. From at least the 12th century, German kings claimed mining rights to silver and other metals, taking precedence over the local lords. But by the late Middle Ages, mining rights, known as the ''[[Bergregal]]'' were transferred from the king to territorial rulers. Initially, mining rights were granted orally or in writing by individuals. From the early 15th century, mining law was enacted by territorial rulers in the form of decrees or regulations (mining regulations or ''[[Bergordnung]]en''), which often remained in force until the 19th century. A new, far-reaching, legal basis was created with the General Mining Act for the Prussian States of 1865 (''Allgemeines Berggesetz für die Preußischen Staaten von 1865''), which, with local variations, was adopted in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] (1867), [[Bavaria]] (1869), [[Württemberg]] (1874), [[Baden]] (1890) and other countries. With the exception of the [[Kingdom of Saxony]], where a similarly important legal statute, the General Mining Act of the Kingdom of Saxony (''Allgemeines Berggesetz für das Königreich Sachsen'') came into force on 16 June 1868, it became law in all the larger states of Germany.

====Today====
*In Germany, under Article 74 (1) no. 11 of the Basic Law [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], mining law is subject to concurrent legislation. The central legal standard is the Federal Mining Act (''Bundesberggesetz'').
*In Austria the legal basis is quite similar to German law. The primary legislation since 1 January 1999 has been the Mineral Raw Material Act (''Mineralrohstoffgesetz'') or MinroG.
*In Switzerland mining law is a cantonal business and governed by cantonal law.
*Mining law in Liechtenstein is restricted to just a few minerals (metallic ores, fossil fuels and related materials like graphite, anthracite, stone coal, lignite, slate coal, asphalt, bitumen and mineral oils, sulphur, rock salt and salt springs) and governed mainly by the Liechtenstein Property Act, articles 484 to 497. As in Switzerland mining in Liechtenstein is no longer important and the regulations in the property act are largely only procedural regulations.

=== Mining law in English-speaking countries ===
Unlike German mining law, in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] the principle of mining by landowners prevails. The crown only lays claim to gold and silver reserves. In exceptional cases (e.g. where land ownership is divided) mining rights may be given to a third party, whereby the landowners have to be compensated. The mining company pays the landowner a [[lease]], [[dead rent]] or a [[Royalties|royalty]]. The rights to above- and below-ground minerals (as a rule quarries and mines) may be awarded separately.

Mining law in the [[United States]] is also based on English ''[[common law]]''. Here the landowner is likewise the owner of all raw materials to unlimited depth. However, the state retains rights over phosphate, nitrate, potassium salts, asphalt, coal, oil shale and sulphur, and a right of appropriation (not ownership) by the state for oil and gas. Sand and gravel come under the Department of the Interior.

=== Mining law in French-speaking countries ===
In [[France]] and [[Belgium]] the ''[[Code civil]]'' is the basis for mining law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1651">'''Operation Front Line''' is an initiative of [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), a division of the [[Department of Homeland Security]], that operated in the months leading up to the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]] and through the 2005 Presidential Inauguration.

==Overview==
Little information about the program has been publicly revealed.  An [[Office of Management and Budget]] cost–benefit analysis described the program as carried out "to address potential vulnerabilities in immigration and trade systems relative to the national security of the United States."  An ICE spokesperson has noted that the program "focused on immigration violators that may have imposed an enhanced public safety or national security threat."

The cost of the program, the criteria used for arrest, and the overall scope of the program have not been publicly revealed.

A '''plenary power''' or '''plenary authority''' is a complete and absolute power to take action on a particular issue,   with no limitations. It is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] term ''plenus'' ("full").

==United States==
In [[United States constitutional law]], plenary power is a power that has been granted to a body  or person in absolute terms, with no review of or limitations upon the exercise of that power. The assignment of a plenary power to one body divests all other bodies from the right to exercise that power, where not otherwise entitled. Plenary powers are not subject to [[judicial review]] in a particular instance or in general.

There are very few clear examples of such powers in the United States, due to the nature of the Constitution, which grants different, but at times overlapping, roles to the three branches of federal government and to the states. For example, although the [[United States Congress]], under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 (the [[Commerce Clause]]), has been said to have "plenary" power over Interstate Commerce, this does not always preclude the states from passing laws that affect interstate commerce in some way. When an activity is legally classified as interstate commerce, historically the states can regulate this type of activity as long as they do so within the bounds of their Constitutional authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/38/commerce-among-the-states ''The Heritage Guide to The Constitution - Commerce among the States'']. [[The Heritage Foundation]], 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress does appear to have complete and absolute power regarding the declaration of war and peace in Article I, Section 8, Clause 11. Yet the President has control over the Armed Forces as Commander-in-Chief. These powers are in ongoing conflict, as seen by the [[War Powers Resolution]] of 1973.

Another example of the ongoing debate over plenary powers in the US Constitution is the controversy surrounding the [[Spending Clause]] (Article I, Section 8, Clause 1). This clause states that the Congress is allowed to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence [sic] and general Welfare of the United States". How far this clause goes, and what it actually means in practice, has been hotly debated since the ratification of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/34/spending-clause ''The Heritage Guide to The Constitution - Spending Clause'']. [[The Heritage Foundation]], 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

While other Constitutional doctrines, such as the unenumerated powers of states and the rights of individuals, are widely held (both historically and currently) as limiting the plenary power of Congress,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/amendments/10/essays/163/reserved-powers-of-the-states ''The Heritage Guide to The Constitution - Reserved Powers of the States'']. [[The Heritage Foundation]], 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; then-[[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] reflected that "one of the greatest 'fictions' of our federal system is that the Congress exercises only those powers delegated to it, while the remainder are reserved to the States or to the people. The manner in which this Court has construed the Commerce Clause amply illustrates the extent of this fiction. Although it is clear that the people, through the States, delegated authority to Congress to 'regulate Commerce ... among the several States' ([[Commerce Clause]]), one could easily get the sense from this Court's opinions that the federal system exists only at the sufferance of Congress." (''[[Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Association]]'', 1981.)

These conflicts over the definition of who or what retains which plenary powers have wide-ranging consequences, as seen in the example of ''[[United States v. Kagama]]'', where the Supreme Court found that Congress had complete authority over all Native American affairs.

===Statutes===
The Congress may create and charter, through the enactment of statutes, corporate bodies (Federal Corporations) which can be granted (through the Congress' plenary power to legislate) derivative (derived from the legislation, as opposed to the Constitution itself) plenary power(s) in areas that are defined by statute and which comport with the constitution.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) is an example of such an entity. It was created by the Congress as a Federal Corporation, and by statute, the TVA is given plenary authority over the setting the rates (prices) it will charge customers for the electricity that it generates. The Congress effectively gave the TVA plenary power over its generated electricity rate (price) setting process by statutorily making TVA's rate (price) settings exempt and immune from legal review by any process whatsoever, be it State, Federal or otherwise. Once the TVA Act itself was ruled constitutional, its rate setting process received its derivative plenary power.

There is a difference in reach of plenary powers. While in the TVA example the Congress may at any time amend or remove TVA's plenary power to set the rates for the electricity it sells, the President's plenary power to pardon or commute those convicted under the laws of the United States is beyond the reach of the processes of the Federal Government, and requires the amendment of the US Constitution, making it a truly plenary grant of power.

===Presidential pardons===
An example of a plenary power granted to an individual is the power to grant pardons for Federal crimes (not State crimes), which is bestowed upon the [[President of the United States]] under [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]], Section 2, of the US Constitution. The President is granted the power to "grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment".

That is, within the defined zone (e.g., all offences against the United States, except impeachment), the President may modify the punishment, up to the eradication of the fact of conviction and punishment, for offenses against the United States, entirely. Once done, the President's exercise of this power may not be reviewed by any body or through any forum; nor can this self-executing power (because it is self-executing), once exercised by a President, be reversed, or "taken back", by either the granting President, or any of his/her successors.

Neither the power to grant pardon nor the power to construct the scope of a pardon (a commutation) is within the reach of any subsequent review or alteration. Furthermore, [[double jeopardy]] prohibits any subsequent prosecution for the offenses over which the pardon was granted. Even the President himself may not rescind a pardon that either he or a predecessor President has granted once such pardon is executed (i.e., once the official instrument is signed by the President and sealed on behalf of the United States).

The President may also (as in the case of President [[Gerald Ford]] and the then former President [[Richard Nixon]], as well as President [[George H. W. Bush]] and the former Secretary of Defense [[Caspar W. Weinberger]]) ''prospectively'' proclaim a grant of pardon. That is the President may proclaim the pardon of an individual, a group, a corporation, or any entity chargeable of offences under Federal law, prospectively making the subject immune from Federal prosecution for past criminal acts.

Such a pardon does this by destroying the possibility of a prosecution having a purposeful meaning or result. The rules of [[judicial procedure]] make such a future prosecution, or the continuance of an ongoing prosecution, moot. Thereby a motion for dismissal of an ongoing prosecution, or of an initiated future prosecution, is granted by a Court, on the grounds that the prosecution would be of no purpose or effect, and that it would needlessly waste a Court's time and the resources of an accused, who would only have the charges, for which a pardon had been proclaimed, dismissed anyway.

===Immigration law===
{{See also|Consular nonreviewability}}
In regard to immigration law, Congress, under the Plenary Power Doctrine, has the power to make immigration policy subject to judicial oversight. The Executive Branch is charged with enforcing the immigration laws passed by Congress. The doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders. Courts generally refrain from interfering in immigration matters.&lt;ref name="cis.org"/&gt; Historically, the U.S. Supreme Court has taken a hands-off approach when asked to review the political branches' immigration decisions and policy-making. The [[Center for Immigration Studies]], an organization with a slant toward isolationism, suggests there is a movement to "erode" political-branch control over immigration in favor of a judge-administered system and that the results have created national security concerns.&lt;ref name="cis.org"&gt;Jon Feere, [http://www.cis.org/plenarypower ''Plenary Power: Should Judges Control U.S. Immigration Policy?''] [[Center for Immigration Studies]], February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Zadvydas v. Davis]]'' is cited as an example of the U.S. Supreme Court not following plenary power precedent.&lt;ref name="cis.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gabriel J. Chin]], [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1789185 ''Is There a Plenary Power Doctrine? A Tentative Apology and Prediction for Our Strange but Unexceptional Constitutional Immigration Law''].  Georgetown Immigration Law Review, Vol. 14, No. 2, p. 257, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also discovered weaknesses in the [[FISH (cipher)|FISH]] cipher and designed the stream cipher [[Pike (cipher)|Pike]].

In 1998, Anderson founded the [[Foundation for Information Policy Research]], a [[think tank]] and [[lobbying]] group on information-technology policy.

Anderson is also a founder of the UK-Crypto mailing list and the [[economics of security]] research domain.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Anderson: [http://www.acsa-admin.org/2001/papers/110.pdf Why information security is hard – an economic perspective], ACSAC 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is well-known among Cambridge academics as an outspoken defender of academic freedoms, intellectual property and other matters of university politics. He is engaged in the ″Campaign for Cambridge Freedoms″&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/ccf.html Campaign for Cambridge Freedoms]&lt;/ref&gt; and has been an elected member of Cambridge University Council since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Election to the Council: Notices [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2002-03/weekly/5906/4.html 2 December 2002] and [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2006-07/weekly/6053/5.html 7 November 2006], [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/ Cambridge University Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2004, the student newspaper ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'' declared Anderson to be Cambridge University's "''most powerful person''".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Power 100, [[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]], [http://www.varsity.co.uk/archive/591.pdf Issue 591], 16 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, he became an outspoken critic of [[trusted computing]] proposals, in particular [[Microsoft]]'s [[Next-Generation Secure Computing Base|Palladium]] operating system vision.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Anderson: [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/tcpa-faq.html ‘Trusted Computing’ Frequently Asked Questions], August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson's TCPA FAQ has been characterised by IBM TC researcher David R. Safford as "full of technical errors" and of "presenting speculation as fact."&lt;ref&gt;http://domino.research.ibm.com/comm/research_projects.nsf/pages/gsal.TCG.html/$FILE/tcpa_rebuttal.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For years Anderson has been arguing that by their nature large [[database]]s will never be free of abuse by breaches of security. He has said that if a large system is designed for ease of access it becomes insecure; if made watertight it becomes impossible to use. This is sometimes known as ''Anderson's Rule''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/henryporter/2009/aug/10/id-card-database-breach Guardian newspaper article on a security breach, in which Anderson's Rule is formulated]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson is the author of ''Security Engineering'', published by Wiley in 2001.&lt;ref name="securityengineering"/&gt; He was the founder and editor of ''Computer and Communications Security Reviews''.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

After the vast [[Global surveillance disclosure]] leaked by [[Edward Snowden]] beginning in June 2013 Anderson suggested one way to begin stamping out the British state's unaccountable involvement in this NSA spying scandal is to entirely end the domestic secret services. Anderson: “Were I a legislator, I would simply abolish [[MI5]]." Anderson notes the only way this kind of systemic data collection has been made possible was through the [[business model]]s of private industry. The value of information-driven web companies such as Facebook and [[Google]] is built around their ability to gather vast tracts of data. It was something the intelligence agencies would have struggled with alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/tamlinmagee/2014/01/03/cambridges-head-of-cryptography-i-would-abolish-mi5 Cambridge's Head of Cryptography: I Would Abolish MI5], Forbes, 3 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson is a critic of [[Smart meter|smart meters]], writing that there are various privacy and energy security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fipr.org/100110smartmeters.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
Anderson was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2009|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2009]]. His nomination reads: {{centred pull quote|Professor Ross Anderson, Personal Chair in Security Engineering, Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge.

Ross Anderson is a pioneer and world leader in security engineering, and is distiinguished [''sic''] for starting a number of new areas of research in hardware, software and systems.

His early work on how systems fail established a base of empirical evidence for building [[threat model]]s for a wide range of applications from banking to healthcare.

He has made trailblazing contributions that helped establish a number of new re-esearch [''sic''] topics, including security usability, hardware [[Tamper resistance|tamper-resistance]], [[information hiding]], and the analysis of [[application programming interface]]s.

He is also one of the founders of the study of information [[Economics of security|security economics]], which not only illuminates where the most effective attacks and defences may be found, but is also of fundamental importance to making policy for the [[information society]].&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC/2009/02%27) |title=EC/2009/02: Anderson, Ross |publisher=The Royal Society |archivedate=30 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RS6Nnaoj?url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%3D%27EC%2F2009%2F02%27%29 |location=London |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11582">'''SEC Rule 10b5-1''', codified at {{CodeFedReg|17|240|10b5-1}},  is a [[regulation]] enacted by the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7881.htm |title=Final Rule: Selective Disclosure and Insider Trading|publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC states that Rule 10b5-1 was enacted in order to resolve an unsettled issue over the definition of [[insider trading]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7881.htm |title=Final Rule: Selective Disclosure and Insider Trading: Insider Trading Rules |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is prohibited by [[SEC Rule 10b-5]].

Different [[Court of appeals|courts of appeals]] had come to different conclusions about what constituted [[insider trading]] under [[SEC Rule 10b-5|Rule 10b-5]] — specifically, whether someone could be held liable for insider trading simply by trading while in possession of inside information, or whether a [[trier of fact]] must find that the person actually used that inside information when making the trade.

== "Possession" versus "use" ==
Paragraph (a) of the Rule essentially repeats the holding of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[United States v. O'Hagan]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-842.ZO.html |title=United States, Petitioner v. James Herman O'Hagan |work=[[Legal Information Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ussc|521|642|1997}}, which defines [[insider trading]] under the [[Misappropriation|misappropriation theory]]. It states, in full, that

{{quote|The "manipulative and deceptive devices" prohibited by Section 10(b) of the Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder include, among other things, the purchase or sale of a security of any issuer, on the basis of material nonpublic information about that security or issuer, in breach of a duty of trust or confidence that is owed directly, indirectly, or derivatively, to the issuer of that security or the shareholders of that issuer, or to any other person who is the source of the [[inside information|material nonpublic information]].&lt;ref name="lii"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/240.10b5-1 |title=17 CFR 240.10b5-1 - Trading 'on the basis of' material nonpublic information in insider trading cases |work=[[Legal Information Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Paragraph (b) addresses the unsettled "possession" versus "use" issue, stating that a person violates [[SEC Rule 10b-5|Rule 10b-5]] simply by trading while in "possession" of [[inside information]].  It states, in full, that

{{quote|Subject to the affirmative defenses in paragraph (c) of this section, a purchase or sale of a security of an issuer is "on the basis of" material nonpublic information about that security or issuer if the person making the purchase or sale was aware of the material nonpublic information when the person made the purchase or sale.&lt;ref name="lii" /&gt;}}

In other words, under 10b5-1(b) a person could be liable for insider trading simply by possessing inside information regarding a given [[security]], breaching a fiduciary duty to the source of the information, and then trading it with a self-serving intent, even if he or she would have made the trade anyway. See ''''[[United States v. O'Hagan]]'', 521 U.S. 642, 652 (1997). But it is unlikely the SEC will detect or particularly care about a small trade that would have occurred anyway. A large trade or series of trades that reap unusual benefits for a trader, however, will likely be detected, and it would be difficult to prove that the material non-public information did not contribute to the decision to make the trade.

== Affirmative legal defense for planned trades ==
In paragraph (c), however, the SEC created an [[affirmative defense]] to any charge of insider trading, "designed to cover situations in which a person can demonstrate that the material nonpublic information was not a factor in the trading decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/33-7881.htm#P264_100527 |title=Final Rule: Selective Disclosure and Insider Trading: Provisions of Rule 10b5-1 |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provision allows an affirmative defense to insider trading when the trade was made pursuant to a contract, instructions given to another, or a written plan that "[d]id not permit the person to exercise any subsequent influence over how, when, or whether to effect purchases or sales" (10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B)(3)), and where the plan (or contract or instructions) was created before the person had inside information.

For example, a [[CEO]] of a company could call a broker on January 1 and enter into a plan to sell a particular quantity of [[shares]] of his company's [[stock]] on March 1, find out terrible news about his company on February 1 that will not become public until April 1, and then go forward with the  March 1 sale anyway, saving himself from losing money when the bad news becomes public.  Under the terms of Rule 10b5-1(b) this is insider trading because the CEO "was aware" of the inside information when he made the trade. But he can assert an [[affirmative defense]] under Rule 10b5-1(c), because he planned the trade before he learned the [[inside information]].

== A possible loophole: canceling plans ==

After Rule 10b5-1 was enacted, the SEC staff publicly took the position that canceling a planned trade made under the [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] does not constitute [[insider trading]], even if the person was aware of the [[inside information]] when canceling the trade.  The SEC stated that, despite the fact that 10b5-1(c) requires trades to be irrevocable, there can be no liability for [[insider trading]] under [[Rule 10b-5]] without an actual securities transaction, based on the U.S. Supreme Court's holding in ''[[Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores]]'', [[Case citation|421 U.S. 723]] (1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/interps/telephone/phonesupplement4.htm |title=Division of Corporation Finance: Manual of Publicly Available Telephone Interpretations: Fourth Supplement |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] |date=June 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This staff interpretation raises the possibility that executives can exploit this safe harbor by entering into 10b5-1 trading plans before they have inside information while retaining the option to later cancel those plans based on inside information. Although paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) does deny the affirmative defense to offsetting or [[Hedge (finance)|hedged transactions]], in that case there would still be an actual trade (whichever of the offsetting trades was not canceled) that could constitute [[insider trading]] and violate Rule 10b-5. The SEC's position is that there can be no insider trading without a trade, so that a person could cancel a planned trade based on inside information and avoid [[Legal liability|liability]]. Although technically any plan that is cancelable does not come under the 10b5-1 safe harbor, proving that an executed trade was hypothetically cancelable might be very difficult.

A few academic commentators have written about this issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fried |first=Jesse M. |title=Insider Abstention 
|journal=Yale Law Journal |volume=13 |pages=455–492 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that insiders can make systematically above-market profits by using 10b5-1 plans that they are still able to cancel. One empirical study has found that insiders using 10b5-1 plans do in fact make above-market profits (the paper also alludes to other potential loopholes that might explain this result),&lt;ref name="Jagolinzer"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sec Rule 10b5-1 and Insiders' Strategic Trade |first=Alan D. |last=Jagolinzer |journal= Management Science |date=February 2009 |ssrn=330520 |doi= 10.1287/mnsc.1080.0928 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another has found that the presence of publicly announced 10b5-1 plans has economic effects on securities markets that are generally associated with insider trading.&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Rule 10b5-1 Loophole: An Empirical Study |first=Alexander Patrick |last=Robbins |date=May 3, 2008 |ssrn=941238 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.941238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others contend that rather than timing trades, executives may time news or [[press releases]] to move the stock before a 10b5-1 plan sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=karl_muth |title=With Avarice Aforethought: Insider Trading and 10b5-1 Plans |first=Karl |last=Muth |date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SEC reaction ==
Noted in a  speech by [[Linda Chatman Thomsen]], the SEC chief enforcement officer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2007/spch030807lct2.htm |title=Speech by SEC Staff: Remarks at the 2007 Corporate Counsel Institute |first=Linda |last=Chatman Thomsen |authorlink=Linda Chatman Thomsen |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the SEC is now investigating why 10b5-1 trades appear to outperform the market.&lt;ref name="Jagolinzer" /&gt;  Allegations of improper 10b5-1 trades were noted during the insider trading trial of Joseph Nacchio, former Qwest CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2007/04/04/sec-scrutinizing-10b5-1-selling-plans |title=SEC Scrutinizing 10b5-1 Selling Plans |work=Law Blog |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=April 4, 2007 |first=Peter |last=Lattman}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also preliminary investigations into 10b5-1 trades by [[Angelo Mozilo]] from [[Countrywide Financial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bipc.com/media/xpqPublicationDetail.aspx?xpST=PubDetail&amp;pub=8020 |title=UPDATE: 10b5-1 Plans Under Increased Scrutiny |publisher=[[Buchanan, Ingersoll &amp; Rooney]] |date=October 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC sent a [[Wells notice|Wells Notice]] to Mozilo in May 2009, suggesting intent to pursue civil charges in relation to alleged illegal trades through his 10b5-1 plan.

On March 25, 2009, the SEC staff revised its interpretative guidance regarding the circumstances under which the affirmative defense in Rule 10b5-1(c) is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/exchangeactrules-interps.htm |title=Exchange Act Rules |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gibsondunn.com/publications/pages/SECStaffIssuesInterpretiveGuidance-10B5-1Plans.aspx |title=SEC Staff Issues Updated Interpretive Guidance on Rule 10B5-1 Plans |date=April 24, 2009 |publisher=[[Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the staff followed the approach previously urged by some commentators&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt; to clarify (1) that the cancellation of a 10b5-1 plan could call the good faith of other, executed plans into doubt and (2) that the Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores]]'', 421 U.S. 723 (1975), did not affect the SEC's ability to bring an enforcement action against a would-be insider trader who canceled a trading plan and did not trade in a particular transaction because a subsequent decision, ''[[Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., v. Dabit]]'', 547 U.S. 71 (2006), made clear that ''Blue Chip Stamps'' dealt only with the implied private right of action for violations of Rule 10b-5 and not the "in connection with" requirement for all Rule 10b-5 violations.

A '''serving channel''' (sometimes called a '''depot channel''') is a [[slang]] term for a [[file sharing]] channel found on an [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] network.  Here, users can share and download files including photos, videos, audio files, books, programs, etc.  Users that are actively sharing their files are generally referred to as 'servers', whereas users that download without sharing their own files are generally referred to as '[[Leech (computing)|leeches]]'.  While serving normally implies pirated or questionable material, some channels are used for fully legitimate reasons.  There are two styles of servers, [[Fserve]]s, and serving scripts like OmenServe.

== Fserve type channels ==
Using an Fserve script, a server is set up like an [[FTP]].  Using [[Client-To-Client Protocol|CTCP]] commands and server triggers, a user can initiate a connection with the server.  Once connected, the user will be given realtime access to a server's file archive.
*''ex.: "&lt;code&gt;/CTCP &amp;lt;username&amp;gt; &amp;lt;trigger&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;"''

=== Searching and requesting with Fserves ===
Once a leech has gained access to a server's Fserve, they can navigate through folders using commands similar to [[DOS]].  Once inside a folder, the user is able to retrieve a listing of what files are found there.
*''ex.: "&lt;code&gt;cd &amp;lt;foldername&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;" &amp; "&lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt;" (to display files)''

To request a file, the user enters a filename from the folder display listing, along with the "&lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;" command.
*''ex.: "&lt;code&gt;get &amp;lt;filename.ext&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;"''

== Serving script type channels ==
Using a serving script, servers have the ability to send files directly to another user using remote commands.  The serving script compiles a listing of available files, and also listens for a leech to request a file.  Serving scripts also allow for a user to search all of the servers in a channel at the same time with a single command.

=== Searching and requesting with serving scripts ===
A user initiates a search by typing a 'search command' followed by a 'search string' within the channel window.  Various search commands exist, including '@find', '@search', and '@seek', depending on what serving script is being used.  [[Wildcard character]]s such as * can also be used in the search string to simplify a search.  The search command will then return a list of files to the user's query window if any servers have a file that matches the search string.
*''ex.: "&lt;code&gt;@find &amp;lt;keyword&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;"''

If there are any matches for the user's search string, the next step is to request those files from the server.  The user can copy and paste the returned match, along with a short trigger command, from the query window directly into the channel window.  The request is then placed in a file [[Queue (data structure)|queue]] within the serving script, and downloaded on a [[first-come, first-served]] basis.
*''ex.: "&lt;code&gt;!&amp;lt;username&amp;gt; &amp;lt;filename.ext&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;"''

Users also have the ability to download the complete archive of a server's available files, commonly called a "list" due to the [[.txt]] format that the script's output code creates.  To request a server's list, there is a separate 'list trigger' used.
*''ex.: "&lt;code&gt;@&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;"''

[[File:Oxford sham marriage - Would-be-bride is escorted away.jpg|thumb|right|Officers from the [[UK Border Agency]] lead away the would-be bride in an operation to prevent a sham marriage.]]

A '''sham marriage''' or '''fake marriage''' is a [[marriage of convenience]] entered into purely for the purpose of gaining a benefit or other advantage arising from that status. While referred to as a "sham" or "fake" because of its motivation, the union itself is still legally valid if it conforms to the formal legal requirements for marriage in that country. Arranging or entering into such a marriage to deceive public officials is itself a separate violation of the law of some countries. In the United States, sham marriage for purposes of [[illegal immigration|immigration fraud]] is a felony.

After a period, a couple often [[divorce]]s if the marriage is no longer necessary or useful.

Sham marriages are distinct from [[bride scam|marriage fraud]], which is a type of [[romance scam]], in which one spouse is unwittingly taken advantage of by the foreign spouse who feigns romantic interest, typically in order to obtain a [[residence permit]] or [[gold digging|for money]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voif.org/|title=Victims of Immigration Fraud|website=voif.org|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/romance-scams|title=Romance Scams|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/protect-fraud/marriage-fraud.html|title=Protect yourself from marriage fraud - Canada.ca|first=Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|last=Canada|website=www.canada.ca|accessdate=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Cornell mcclintic.jpg|thumb|right|[[Guthrie McClintic]] and [[Katharine Cornell]] were reported to have a [[lavender marriage]].]] --&gt;
Common reasons for sham marriages are to gain [[immigration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Owner of Thai Ginger admits to immigration fraud – paying people to 'marry' her relatives|url=http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/east_king/bel/news/65882672.html|publisher=Bellevue Reporter|date=2009-10-23|accessdate=2011-04-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028085213/http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/east_king/bel/news/65882672.html|archivedate=2009-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai Ginger owner sentenced for sham-marriage scheme| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2011129819_thaiginger20m.html| publisher=Seattle Times|date=2010-02-19|accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; residency, work or [[citizenship]] rights for one or both of the spouses, or for other benefits.

There have been cases of people entering into a sham marriage to avoid suspicion of [[homosexuality]] or [[bisexuality]]. For example, Hollywood studios had allegedly requested homosexual actors, such as [[Rock Hudson]], to conceal their homosexuality in a so-called [[lavender marriage]].

== Fraud ==
Since the introduction of stricter modern immigration laws in [[First World]] countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walter|first1=Sim|title=Convictions for bogus marriages soar to 284: ICA|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/convictions-bogus-marriages-soar-284-ica-20140626|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; sham marriages have become a common method to allow a foreigner to reside, and possibly gain citizenship, in the more desirable country of the spouse. The couple marries with knowledge that the marriage is solely for the purpose of obtaining the favorable immigration status. This is frequently arranged as a business transaction (i.e., a substantial sum of money is paid) and occurs more commonly with foreigners already in the country.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} United States immigration law considers this to be fraudulent, imposing a penalty of a $250,000 fine and five-year prison sentence on the citizen, and deportation of the foreigner, for such marriages not made in good faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://aboutusvisas.com/immigration-marriage-fraud/ |title=Just Say No to Immigration Marriage Fraud |publisher=The Law Office of Tanya M. Lee |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The INS and the Justice Department say that they do not have accurate numbers on the rate of attempted marriage fraud.&lt;ref&gt;(Manwani v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 736 F. Supp. 1367 (W.D.N.C. 1990)).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009 fiscal year, 506 of the 241,154 petitions filed were denied for suspected fraud, a rate of less than 0.09%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investigating Marriage Fraud in New York|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/nyregion/13fraud.html?pagewanted=all|work=Ny Times|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=2 April 2013|date=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Sham marriage in the United Kingdom}}
The [[UK Border Agency]] issued guidance to clergy in April 2011 to help prevent weddings for visas. English and Welsh clergy may perform a marriage, according [[Marriage in England and Wales|to the law there]]. They have been advised not to offer to publish [[Banns of marriage|banns for any marriage]] which involves someone from outside Europe. Instead, the couple will be asked to apply for a license and if a member of the clergy is not satisfied that a marriage is genuine, they must make that clear to the person responsible for granting the licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/sham-marriage-bishops|title=Bishops act to tackle sham marriages|date=11 April 2011|work=homeoffice.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland in August 2010, it was claimed that sham marriages account for one in six marriages, residency status in the [[European Union]] and circumventing immigration rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pain of divorce |url=http://www.herald.ie/national-news/city-news/oneinsix-irish-marriages-is-a-migrant-sham-2300285.html |title=One-in-six Irish marriages 'is a migrant sham' – City News, National News |publisher=Herald.ie |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2010/0817/1224276972826.html |title=Registrar warns of rapid rise in 'sham marriages' – The Irish Times – Tue, Aug 17, 2010 |publisher=The Irish Times |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0817/1224276974167.html |title=Few legal means to restrict rise in bogus unions – The Irish Times – Tue, Aug 17, 2010 |publisher=The Irish Times |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tuesday, August 17, 2010 – 08:07 AM |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/superintendent-registrar-15-of-irish-marriages-could-be-bogus-469611.html |title=Superintendent registrar: 15% of Irish marriages could be bogus |publisher=Irish Examiner |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation and investigation ==
Definitions of sham marriage vary by jurisdiction, but are often related to immigration. According to a 2013 [[Home Office]] document in the UK:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/256257/Sham_Marriage_and_Civil_Partnerships.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
:"A sham marriage, or marriage of convenience, or a sham civil partnership describes a marriage or civil partnership entered into for immigration advantage by two people who are not a genuine couple. A sham marriage or civil partnership is to be distinguished from a marriage or civil partnership entered into by a genuine couple where it may be convenient for immigration or other reasons for the couple to be married or civil partners."

In [[Canada]], legislation on sham marriages has been strengthened in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/protection/fraud/marriage.asp|title=Marriage fraud|work=cic.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there has been continuous controversy regarding the issue. The Canadian officials have been accused both of being too harsh and harassing couples and of being too lenient in deciding what is a genuine relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/immigration/2013/04/29/marriage_fraud_canadian_immigration_officials_tread_thin_line.html|title=Marriage fraud: Canadian immigration officials tread thin line|date=29 April 2013|work=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, there have been objections to the policy from [[women's rights|women's organizations]] who have argued that the new policy which requires the sponsor and the new spouse to live in a "genuine relationship" for two years endangers women who are victims of [[domestic violence]]. Although there is an exception to this rule in cases of abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/backgrounders/2012/2012-10-26a.asp|title=Backgrounder — Conditional Permanent Resident Status|work=cic.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; the policy has been accused of being too weak (as abuse is difficult to prove).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2012/12/05/canadian_immigration_changes_force_women_to_stay_with_sponsoring_spouse_for_two_years.html|title=Canadian immigration changes force women to stay with sponsoring spouse for two years|date=5 December 2012|work=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Solar Ark''' (ソーラーアーク) is an ark-shaped solar [[photovoltaic]] power generation facility which offers activities to cultivate a better appreciation of [[solar power]] generation, and thereby benefitting both ecology and science.&lt;ref name=specref&gt;{{cite web |title=Large-Scale Solar Power Generation Facility 'Solar Ark' |url=http://us.sanyo.com/Solar/Solar-Ark |publisher=Panasonic Corporation of North America |accessdate=January 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518190429/http://us.sanyo.com/Solar/Solar-Ark |archivedate=May 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Inhabitat&gt;{{cite web |title=SOLAR ARK: World's Most Stunning Solar Building |first=Ali |last=Kriscenski |url=http://inhabitat.com/solar-ark-worlds-most-stunning-solar-building/ |publisher=Inhabitat |date=January 14, 2008 |accessdate=January 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 315-meter-wide, 37-meter-tall facility is located in [[Anpachi, Gifu|Anpachi]], [[Gifu Prefecture]],&lt;ref name=anpachi&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ja:見どころ＞お立ち寄りスポット |url=http://www.town.anpachi.gifu.jp/otatiyori.html |publisher=Anpachi official website |accessdate=August 28, 2011 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927090522/http://www.town.anpachi.gifu.jp/otatiyori.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the geographical center of [[Japan]], and can be seen from the [[Tōkaidō Shinkansen|JR Tōkaidō]] bullet train, which runs past on an adjacent railway. It has over 5000 panels that produce approximately 530,000 kilowatt-hours on an annual basis and a maximum system power of 630 kilowatts.

Stationed at the center of the Solar Ark is the Solar Lab, a [[museum]] of [[solar energy]].  A hands-on, outdoor light exhibition was planned for opening in 2005. The Solar Ark was an enterprise partner with the [[2005 World Exhibition]], [[Aichi Prefecture]], Japan. It is one of the largest solar buildings in the world.

==History==

The Solar Ark was constructed by [[Sanyo]] Electric Co. Its development was accidental among other things.&lt;ref name=Sunsology&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunsology Blog|url=http://www.sunsolagy.co.uk/blog/?p=51|work=The Sunsology blog|accessdate=November 11, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425154900/http://www.sunsolagy.co.uk/blog/?p=51|archivedate=April 25, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, Sanyo Electric had intended to create the largest photovoltaic system in the world, with a 3.4 megawatt output, to mark the organisation's 50th anniversary. By 1998, designers had already been in discussions about the Solar Ark’s appearance. Sanyo had planned on using cutting edge solar technology available to them at the time, using a combination of crystal silicon and thin-film amorphous silicon with 14-15% efficiency. However, during the initial planning, Sanyo had to recall several monocrystalline cells, which were the predecessors of the hybrid technology mentioned before, due to insufficient output.&lt;ref name=TOFT&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of Things Article|url=http://thefutureofthings.com/pod/1090/solar-ark.html|work=The Things of the Future website|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Photon&gt;{{cite web|title= Photon International on the ark|url=http://www.photon-magazine.com/News/news_02-06_ap_sanyo.htm|work=Article on recalled solar panels|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanyo Electric Co. still decided to go ahead with the Solar Ark’s construction; however, instead of using the previously planned technology, Sanyo instead, used the recalled monocrystalline cells. Sanyo says “We have done this to show our sincere regret that this problem has occurred and to express our willingness and determination to both remember what happened and how important it is to maintain quality.” Construction was completed in December 2001.

[[Panasonic]] acquired Sanyo, and as part of its corporate restructuring and re-branding strategy, the red Sanyo logo on the Solar Ark was replaced with a blue Panasonic logo in August 2011.&lt;ref name=rebranding&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:「ソーラーアーク」のブランド表記の変更について|url=http://panasonic.co.jp/corp/news/official.data/data.dir/jn110624-1/jn110624-1.html|work=Panasonic and Sanyo Electric press release |date=June 24, 2011 |accessdate=December 7, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Solar Ark 1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Solar Ark viewed from below]]
[[File:Panasonic Solar Ark.jpg|thumb|Panasonic Solar Ark]]
The Solar Ark's design was inspired by the vision of an ark embarking on a journey to the 21st century. This idea led to the Solar Ark’s size and overall symbolic shape of being an example of producing clean energy. In total, the construction area for the Solar Ark is 3294.48 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; reinforced concrete was used for the base of the construction.  From one end to the other, the total length of the Solar Ark is 315 metres. The ark is 31.6 metres tall from the centre of the structure. There are 5,046 solar panels in total. Twelve single-crystal silicon solar cell modules per unit were assembled on the ground, and 470 units were lifted up and attached to the main body of the Solar Ark.&lt;ref name=Inhabitat/&gt;

The weight of the actual body of the ark (pillars being excluded) is 3,000 metric tonnes and is constructed from [[structural steel]]. This construction material helps give the impression of the solar ark being suspended in the air. Each column is 2 metres in diameter and 31 meters in length and the Solar Ark is 315 metres long.&lt;ref name=ideabing&gt;{{cite web |title=Sustainability: Sanyo’s Solar Ark |url=http://www.idea.ideabing.com/2010/08/12/sustainability-sanyos-solar-ark/ |publisher=Ideabing.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520063521/http://www.idea.ideabing.com/2010/08/12/sustainability-sanyos-solar-ark/ |archivedate=May 20, 2011 |accessdate=January 11, 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire Solar Ark chassis is supported by four “G-Columns” which are custom built pillars by [[Kubota Corporation|Kubota]] and in total, these pillars weigh approximately 5,000 tonnes. These high-quality pillars are homogeneous, the result of the seamless method of construction that utilizes centrifugal force. Due to the Solar Ark's sturdy building materials, the Ark is able to resist winds of up to 34 meters/second and level 7 earthquakes on the [[Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale|Japanese scale]].

The ark is surrounded by 5-meter high water fountains and two ponds, each having their own cascade. The entrance to the Solar Ark has solar wings which are composed of HIT solar cells that generate electricity on the topside and underside while also functioning as awnings that allow sunlight to filter through. Between the individual [[solar panels]], there are, in total, 75,000 red, green, and blue computer controlled [[LEDs]] which are activated at night to produce images and words across the ark.

==Museum==

The [[Solar Energy]] Museum is structurally separate from the Solar Ark itself. It is officially called the solar lab. It is a museum and exhibition centre that mostly provides information about solar energy. There are several exhibitions, workshops and science classes held at the solar lab, which are primarily aimed at the younger generations, to help them become more aware of the photovoltaic science and how it impacts the world. The solar lab is divided into ten zones that provide a wide range of activities for visitors. Some of these activities include a [[solar system]] simulator, an adventure wall, an artistic approach to the sun, a solar library and a control deck, where visitors can view real time data related to the power being generated by the Solar Ark.

==Awards==

The Solar Ark has received several awards and notable achievements during its operation.

* Good Design Award 2002 Architecture and Environment Design/Architecture Design
* The 5th "Renewing Your Hometown" 21st Century Fine Art Awards (Honorable Mention)
* The 12th "Facilities that Publicize Energy" Award (Exhibition Category)
* The 12th Advertising Contest on the Environment, Grand Prix of Environment Advertising Award (Presented by State Minister for the Environment)  
* The 2nd Environment and Facility Prize, Outstanding Performance Award (Environmental Design Category)  
* Energy Publicity Center Award for PR Activity, the 14th Director-General of the Natural Energy Agency Award, 2004

'''Somyot Chueathai''' ({{lang-th|สมยศ เชื้อไทย}}; born 1950) is a [[Thai people|Thai]] [[academician]], [[constitutional law]] and [[public law]] [[professor]] and 15th [[dean (education)|dean]] of the [[Faculty of Law, Thammasat University]], the oldest faculty of law in the country.

After graduating from the Faculty of Law, Thammasat University, as a [[Bachelor of Laws]] [[Honorary degree|''(honoris causa)'']], Somyot became a member of the [[Thai Bar Association]]. Following that, he studied abroard in [[Germany]], where he has been conferred a public law [[Academic certificate|certificate]] by the [[University of Bonn]].

After completing education courses in Germany, Somyot became a civil servant of Thammasat University, where he served as a public law [[lecturer]] until his retirement in 2012. Chueathai had been the Thammasat University Deputy Rector for Student Affairs, the President of the Thammasat Law Association (2004–2008), the Director-General of the Legal Centre (2009), a member of the [[Council of State of Thailand|Council of State]] (2009–present), etc.

During his tenure as the President of the Thammasat Law Association, Somyot had for many times launched public campaigns against [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], then [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]], calling for impeachment of Thaksin on account of the [[Thaksin Shinawatra#Convictions and exile|series of corruption and conflict of interest scandals]]. In 2006, Thaksin decreed the [[Thai general election, 2006|dissolution of the House of Representatives]]. Somyot issued the following statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"According to the democratic principles, the dissolution of the House of Representatives is the power the Executive Branch may exercise in order to solve the crisis between the Council of Ministers and the National Assembly or the problems of the House of Representatives itself. [...] But, this time, the dissolution of the House has been decreed and the new election has been fixed urgently. It raises a question as to whether Mr Thaksin has exercised the executive power to wash himself before coming back to the power. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the [[2006 Thai coup d'état|military coup against Thaksin in 2006]] and the [[2007 Constitution of Thailand|promulgation of the new Constitution in 2007]], Somyot stated that he once foretold that the new constitution will be unlikely to solve any problems in the country, but no one pays attention to the words of a public law instructor like him because everyone wants to have a new election taken place without delay. Somyot then declared that he ceased to teach constitutional law from that time onwards. He said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The upcoming problems are [[judicial activism]]. The 2007 Constitution has bound the judges with political affairs. This will result in serious worries, because the heart of the Constitution should be the [[separation of powers]]. [...] When the courts are empowered to interfere with the politics, a chaos will ensue. [...]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Today, the Constitution is treated as a [[scapegoat]]. It is like a house which has been taken to pieces by its residents in order to build up a new one which is in good odour with them. But, a newly built house will never serve their wish and will then be taken down again and again, until the residents see the true problem of the house — a little leak somewhere on the roof or elsewhere. [...] [http://www.asianlii.org/th/legis/const/2007/1.html Section 309 of the Constitution] will cause the return of a new coup and a new coup and a new coup, over and over. The section is like a son that kills his own father, because it is bigger than the Constitution. Now, I'd like to tell you that I won't teach constitutional law anymore, because I cannot accept section 309."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Somyot has produced many prominent academic works, all of which could be viewed at the [http://search.library.tu.ac.th/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=Q237W215173T2.430378&amp;profile=pridi&amp;uri=link=3100008@!54992@!3100001@!3100002&amp;aspect=basic_search&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=2&amp;source=203.131.219.164@!db73_tudb&amp;term=%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%A8+%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%AD%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A2.&amp;index= Office of the Libraries, Thammasat University].

As for his personal life, Somyot is a football player. He has played football since he was a student at the Faculty of Law, Thammasat University. During his tenure at Thammasat, Somyot also served as a manager of the University football team and usually plays football with his students in his spare time.

Somyot is usually called by his students as "Ong Dam" (องค์ดำ), which means "Black Deity," due to his proficiency and his dark skin. While [[Kaewsan Atibodhi]], former lecturer at the same faculty, is called "Ong Khao" (องค์ขาว), meaning "White Deity".

Amongst other items it introduced the [[Seat belt legislation|compulsory wearing of seat belts]] for front seat passengers for a trial period of three year.&lt;ref name=rospa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rospa.com/roadsafety/advice/motorvehicles/seatbelt_history.htm |title=Seat Belts: History |publisher=[[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]] |accessdate=2010-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327182821/http://www.rospa.com/RoadSafety/advice/motorvehicles/seatbelt_history.htm |archivedate=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major part of the act was for re-organising the [[British Transport Docks Board]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1981/cukpga_19810056_en_1 Revised Statute from The UK Statute Law Database: Transport Act 1981] ''www.opsi.gov.uk''&lt;/ref&gt; which led to its eventual privatisation.

The Act received Royal Assent 31st July 1981 &lt;ref&gt;https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/56&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Clauses of the Act==

===Reorganisation of British Transport Docks Board===
Part II of the act renamed the British Transport Docks Board as [[Associated British Ports]] and made it a subsidiary a holding company limited by shares to be issued by the Secretary of State or their agents,&lt;ref&gt;Transport Act 1981, Part II "Reconstitution of British Transport Docks Board"&lt;/ref&gt; thus making its privatisation possible.

===Seatbelt legislation===
It had been compulsory to fit front [[seat belts]] to cars built in Europe since 1965 and to all new cars sold in the UK since 1967. The [[Clunk Click]]" TV commercials, starring [[Jimmy Savile]] showing the dangers of being thrown through the windscreen in a collision was shown during the 1970s. Attempts were made to making the wearing of front seat belts compulsory into a Road Traffic Bill in 1973-4 but was unsuccessful. [[John Gilbert, Baron Gilbert|John Gilbert]], the [[Minister of Transport]] proposed a 'Road Traffic (Seat Belts) Bill' in 1976 but it was also unsuccessful. Four further attempts at legislation were made by a number of MPs including [[William Rodgers]] and [[Neil Carmichael, Baron Carmichael of Kelvingrove|Neil Carmichael]] before [[Richard Nugent, Baron Nugent of Guildford|Lord Nugent]] (who was also the president of the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]]) was finally successful, initially by proposing a private member's bill, and then by adding it as an amendment to the Transport Bill in the House of Lords.&lt;ref name=rospa/&gt; The House of Commons voted to accept the amendment on 28 July 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1981/jul/28/compulsory-wearing-of-seat-belts Hansard - 28 July 1981 - Compulsory wearing of seatbelts]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Clauses
The act included clauses for:&lt;ref name=rospa/&gt;
*The compulsory wearing of seat-belts for front seat passengers for three years
*other clauses...

;Legacy
Following the three-year trial the compulsory wearing of seat belts was made permanent when both Houses of Parliament voted 'overwhelmingly' to retain the requirement. Legislation was subsequently introduced for the compulsory fitting of seat belts to the rear of cars (1987), for children to wear seat belts in the back (1989), and then adults(1991). Seat belts were required for minibuses and coaches carrying school children (1996) and for all coaches (2001).&lt;ref name=rospa/&gt;

The '''Treaty of Ancón''' was signed by [[Chile]] and [[Peru]] on October 20, 1883, in the [[Ancón District]] near [[Lima]]. It was intended to settle the two nations' remaining territorial differences at the conclusion of their involvement in the [[War of the Pacific]] and to stabilise post-bellum relations between them.

Under the treaty's terms, Chile gained control over [[Tarapacá Province (Peru)|Tarapacá]]. Chile was also to retain the conquered provinces of [[Tacna Region|Tacna]] and [[Arica Province|Arica]] for ten years, after which their fate was to be decided by a plebiscite. The plebiscite was never held.&lt;ref&gt;Egaña, Rafael (1900) ''The Tacna and Arica question. Historical antecedents.--Diplomatic action. Present state of the affair'' (translated from the Spanish edition by Edwin C. Reed) Barcelona Printing Office, Santiago, Chile, {{OCLC|19301902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in 1929, through the mediation of the [[United States]] under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Herbert Hoover]], an accord was reached. Under the [[Tacna-Arica compromise]], Chile kept Arica, while Peru regained Tacna and received [[USD]] $6 million indemnity and other concessions.&lt;ref&gt;Jane, Lionel Cecil (1930) "The question of Tacna-Arica ..." ''Transactions of the Grotius Society'' 15: pp.&amp;nbsp;93–119&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important provision in the treaty said that Chile could not cede sovereignty of former Peruvian territories to other nations without asking Peru first. The Chapter has been invoked once, during the [[Atacama border dispute#Chilean proposal of 1975|Chilean proposal of 1975]] that offered Bolivia sovereignty over some minor ports. The Peruvian government rejected the proposed land swap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Abrazo de Charaña: Chile y Bolivia restablecen relaciones diplomáticas, después de trece años |publisher=Diario La Tercera |language=es |url=http://siglo20.tercera.cl/1970-79/1975/notas1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323115336/http://siglo20.tercera.cl/1970-79/1975/notas1.htm |archivedate=23 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2049">The '''Treaty of Tokehega''' is a 1980 [[treaty]] between [[New Zealand]] and the [[United States]] that [[Boundary delimitation|delineates]] the [[maritime boundary]] between [[Tokelau]] and [[American Samoa]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Ewan W. (2003). ''International Boundaries: A Geopolitical Atlas,'' p. 595, 866.&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty was signed in [[Atafu]] on 2 December 1980. It specifies the ownership of certain islands and creates a [[Border|boundary]] of seven straight-line [[ocean|maritime]] segments defined by eight individual coordinate points. The treaty was signed shortly after the United States resolved its boundary dispute with the [[Cook Islands]] by agreeing to the [[Cook Islands – United States Maritime Boundary Treaty]].

The treaty states that the United States has sovereignty over [[Swains Island]].  This island, known to many in Tokelau as ''Olohega'', gives its name to the second half, "hega," of the treaty's name.  The first half, "Toke," comes from Tokelau.

The treaty came into effect on 3 September 1983 after it was ratified by both states.

{{Turkish constitutional referendum, 2017}}
{{Politics of Turkey}}
A '''constitutional referendum''' was held throughout [[Turkey]] on 16 April 2017 on whether to approve 18 proposed amendments to the [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkish constitution]] that were brought forward by the governing [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) and the [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP). If approved, the office of the [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Prime Minister]] would be abolished and the existing [[parliamentary system]] of government would be replaced with an [[executive presidency]] and a [[presidential system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkish parliament nears approval of presidential system sought by Erdoğan|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-politics-constitution-idUSKBN153238|publisher=Reuters|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of seats in [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Parliament]] was proposed to be raised from 550 to 600 while the president was proposed to be given more control over appointments to the [[Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors]] (HSYK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/turkish-committee-clears-draft-expanding-erdogans-powers-073856037.html|title=Turkish committee clears draft expanding Erdoğan's powers|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkey Parliament Triggers Referendum on Presidential System|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-21/turkey-parliament-triggers-referendum-on-presidential-system-iy6kd8n6|publisher=Bloomberg|date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was held under a [[state of emergency]] that was declared following a [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|failed military coup attempt]] in July 2016.

Early results indicated a 51–49% lead for the "Yes" vote. In an unprecedented move, the [[Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey|Supreme Electoral Council]] (YSK) allowed non-stamped ballots to be accepted as valid. Some opposers to the reform decried this move to be illegal, claiming that as many as 1.5 million ballots were unstamped, and refused to recognize the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/16/erdogan-claims-victory-turkish-referendum-result-swiftly-challenged/|title=Erdoğan claims victory in Turkish referendum but result swiftly challenged by opposition|author=|date=|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale protests erupted following the results in order to protest the YSK's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeteduvar.com.tr/gundem/2017/04/18/bircok-ilde-referandum-protestolari/ |title=Birçok ilde referandum ve YSK protestosu |publisher=Gazeteduvar.com.tr |date=2017-04-18 |accessdate=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent reports, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) and [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) both criticised unfairness during the campaign and declared the YSK's decision to be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;http://ataturk.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Seçim-Gözlemi-ilk-rapor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.habererk.com/dunya/akpm-referandum-raporunu-acikladi-ysk-karari-yasaya-aykiri-h32325.html |title=AKPM referandum raporunu açıkladı 'YSK kararı yasaya aykırı' |publisher=Habererk.com |date=2017-09-01 |accessdate=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An executive presidency has been a long-standing proposal of the governing AKP and its founder, the current [[President of Turkey]], [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]. In October 2016, the [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP) announced its co-operation for producing draft proposals with the government, with the combined support of both AKP and MHP MPs being sufficient to put forward the proposals to a referendum following a parliamentary vote in January. [[2017 Turkish constitutional referendum 'Yes' campaign|Those in favour of a 'Yes' vote]] argued that the changes were necessary for a strong and stable Turkey, arguing that an executive presidency would bring about an end to unstable [[coalition governments in Turkey|coalition governments that had dominated Turkish politics]] since the 1960s up until 2002. The [[2017 Turkish constitutional referendum 'No' campaign|'No' campaign]] have argued that the proposals would concentrate too much power in the hands of the President, effectively dismantling the [[separation of powers]] and taking legislative authority away from Parliament. Critics argued that the proposed system would resemble an 'elected dictatorship' with no ability to hold the executive to account, leading effectively to a 'democratic suicide' and [[autocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/950313/turkey-is-preparing-to-vote-on-a-constitutional-referendum-that-gives-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-unprecedented-power/|title=Turkey is about to use democracy to end its democracy|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days before the referendum, one of Erdoğan's aides called for a [[federalism|federal system]] should the 'Yes' vote prevail, causing a backlash from the pro-Yes MHP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/bahceli-danismani-eyalet-sistemi-diyorsa-erdogan-da-ses-cikarmiyorsa-ulkuculerin-karari-ne-olabilir,399000|title=Bahçeli: Danışmanı "eyalet sistemi" diyor, Erdoğan ses çıkarmıyorsa, ülkücülerin kararı ne olabilir?|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides of the campaign have been accused of using divisive and extreme rhetoric, with Erdoğan accusing all 'No' voters of being terrorists siding with the plotters of the failed 2016 coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/674799/Erdogan_dan__hayir__diyenlere__terorist_ten_sonra__darbeci__sopasi.html|title=Erdoğan'dan 'hayır' diyenlere 'terörist'ten sonra 'darbeci' sopası|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was marred by allegations of state suppression against 'No' campaigners, while the 'Yes' campaign were able to make use of state facilities and funding to organise rallies and campaign events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/02/turkey-referendum-erdogan-tone-policing-backfires.html|title=In run-up to referendum, Turks can say anything but 'no'|date=17 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411220747/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/02/turkey-referendum-erdogan-tone-policing-backfires.html|archivedate=11 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading members of the 'No' campaign, which included many high-profile former members of the MHP such as [[Meral Akşener]], [[Ümit Özdağ]], [[Sinan Oğan]], and [[Yusuf Halaçoğlu]] were all subject to both violence and campaign restrictions. The 'Yes' campaign were faced with campaigning restrictions by several European countries, with the German, Dutch, Danish and Swiss governments all cancelling or requesting the suspension of 'Yes' campaign events directed at Turkish voters living abroad. The restrictions caused a sharp deterioration in diplomatic relations and caused a [[2017 Dutch–Turkish diplomatic incident|diplomatic crisis]] between Turkey and the [[Netherlands]]. Concerns were also raised about voting irregularities, with 'Yes' voters in Germany being caught attempting to vote more than once and also being found to have been in possession of ballot papers before the overseas voting process had started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yarinhaber.net/guncel/51782/almanyada-referandum-oylamasinda-hile-iddiasi-akp-yoneticisi-secimden-once-pusulayla-poz-verdi|title=Almanya’da referandum oylamasında hile iddiası:AKP yöneticisi seçimden önce pusulayla poz verdi|first=YARIN &amp;#124; Güzel günlerin|last=habercisi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milligazete.com.tr/almanyadaki_referandum_sandiginda_hile/460084|title=Milli Gazete - Almanyadaki referandum sandığında hile|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170411220846/http://www.milligazete.com.tr/almanyadaki_referandum_sandiginda_hile/460084|archivedate=11 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; European election monitors said the vote did not meet international standards.&lt;ref name="IrregularWSJ"/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Turkish constitutional referendum vote and envelope.jpg|thumb|A ballot paper and envelope used in the referendum. 'Evet' translates to Yes while 'Hayır' translates to No.]]
Introducing a presidential system was proposed by then-Minister of Justice [[Cemil Çiçek]] and backed by then-Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Erdoğan]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gündem başkanlık tartışması|url=http://arsiv.ntv.com.tr/news/303471.asp|publisher=[[NTV Turkey]]|accessdate=29 October 2016|language=tr|date=3 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the current presidential system has been openly supported by [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] leaders several times, along with a "new constitution". Justice and Development Party vice-president [[Hayati Yazıcı]] proposed April 2017 as a date for the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AKP'den başkanlık açıklaması: Nisan ayında referanduma gidilebilir|url=http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/akp-den-baskanlik-aciklamasi-nisan-ayinda-referanduma-gidilebilir-132029.html|publisher=[[BirGün]]|accessdate=29 October 2016|language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional amendments==
===Initial proposals===
On 10 December 2016, the AKP and MHP brought forward a total of 21 proposed amendments to the constitution and began collecting signatures from MPs in order to begin the parliamentary procedures for initiating a referendum. After Assembly Commission talks, 3 proposals were withdrawn, leaving 18 amendments remaining. The full-text proposal in Turkish and the present Turkish constitution are found at the following links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anayasadegisikligi.barobirlik.org.tr/pdf/anayasadegisikligikanunteklifi.pdf |format=PDF |title=TÜRKİYE BÜYÜK MİLLET MECLİSİ : SIRA SAYISI: 447 |website=Anayasadegisikligi.barobirlik.org.tr |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anayasa.gov.tr/icsayfalar/mevzuat/1982anayasas%C4%B1.html |title=Anayasa Mahkemesi |website=Anayasa.gov.tr |date= |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important changes have been highlighted by the Union of Turkish Bar Associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anayasadegisikligi.barobirlik.org.tr/Anayasa_Degisikligi.aspx |title=TBB &amp;#124; Anayasa Değişikliği Teklifi'nin Karşılaştırmalı ve Açıklamalı Metni |website=Anayasadegisikligi.barobirlik.org.tr |date= |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TBMM Constitutional Commission 2.jpg|230px|thumb|right|The Parliamentary Constitutional Commission scrutinising the proposed changes]]
After being signed by the AKP's 316 MPs, the 21 proposed changes were submitted to the [[Speaker of the Grand National Assembly]] and were then referred to the Parliamentary Constitutional Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aydinlik.com.tr/politika/2016-aralik/yeni-anayasa-teklifi-meclis-baskanligi-nda |title=Yeni anayasa teklifi Meclis Başkanlığı'nda |date=29 December 2016 |publisher= |accessdate=16 April 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229032330/https://www.aydinlik.com.tr/politika/2016-aralik/yeni-anayasa-teklifi-meclis-baskanligi-nda |archivedate=29 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliamentary Constitutional Commission, headed by AKP MP [[Mustafa Şentop]], began scrutinising the proposals in December 2016, earlier than the planned date of January 2017.  The Constitutional Commission is formed of 25 Members of which 15 are from the AKP, 5 are from the CHP, 3 are from the HDP and 2 are from the MHP, as per the composition of parliament. Since the AKP held a large majority of the commission's seats, it was expected by media commentators that there would be minimal surprise developments at the scrutiny stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yıldız Yazıcıoğlu Abone |url=http://www.amerikaninsesi.com/a/tbmm-anayasa-komisyonunda-gerilimli-gorusme/3651582.html |title=TBMM Anayasa Komisyonu’nda Gerilimli Görüşme |language=tr|website=Amerikaninsesi.com |date=26 December 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debates in the commission were heated, with occasional fights being observed between MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2016/gundem/anayasa-komisyonunda-tartisma-1584254/ |title=Anayasa Komisyonu’nda tansiyon yükseldi – Sözcü Gazetesi |website=Sozcu.com.tr |date=24 December 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitutional Commission has the power to amend or reject the proposed changes before they are put to a vote for all MPs. The Commission made minor changes to numerous proposals, such as raising the number of members of the [[Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors]] from 12 to 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://tr.sputniknews.com/turkiye/201612281026533126-cumhurbaskani-kararname-yetkisi/ |title=Cumhurbaşkanının kararname yetkisi anayasa teklifinden çıkarıldı |website=Tr.sputniknews.com |date=28 December 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, the commission has rejected three of the 21 proposed changes, reducing the constitutional package from 21 proposals to 18. The 5th proposal, which created 'reserve MPs' to take the parliamentary seats that fall vacant between elections, was controversially rejected with just three signatures, well short of the support of 25 commission members or 184 total MPs necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntv.com.tr/turkiye/yedek-milletvekilligiiptal,61ptk2i0wU6sGCzlfHByYA |title=Yedek milletvekilliği iptal |publisher=NTV |date=27 December 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that AKP MPs opposed the creation of 'reserve MPs' on the grounds that it threatened the security of sitting MPs by incentivising reserves to incapacitate them in order to take their seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/anayasa-degisikligi-teklifi-18-maddeye-dusuruldu,380048 |title=Anayasa değişikliği teklifi 18 maddeye düşürüldü - Politika |publisher=T24 |date= |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 15th proposal that gave the President the right to structure the civil service and state institutions through executive decrees was also rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/anayasa-teklifi-degisti-21-maddeden-ikisi-iptal-141183.html|title=Anayasa teklifi değişti:  21 maddeden ikisi iptal|website=Birgun.net|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later on 29 December, the 14th proposal which gave the right for the President to appoint senior bureaucratic officials was rejected.

The Commission completed the approval process on 30 December, rejecting 3 of the 21 proposals in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/r-plans-for-stronger-turkish-presidency-pass-first-hurdle-2016-12?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Plans to expand the powers of Turkey's Erdoğan have passed the first hurdle|publisher=Businessinsider.com|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary voting===
[[File:Turkish MPs voting for constitution 2017.jpg|MPs voting on the proposed amendments, January 2017|thumb|230px]]
Following the completion of the Constitutional Commission hearings, the 18 proposals were presented to parliament for ratification. Constitutional amendments need a three fifths majority (330 votes) to be put forward to a referendum and a two-thirds majority (367 votes) to be ratified directly. [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) officials claimed before the vote that even if the 367-threshold was reached, the government would not ratify the changes without a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AKP, 367'den vazgeçemedi|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/642636/AKP__367_den_vazgecemedi.html|agency=Cumhurriyet|date=9 December 2016|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliament voted on each of the 18 proposals separately in two rounds. The first round served as an indicator of whether the amendments would gather sufficient support, with amendments being proposed by all parties present in the chamber. In the second round, parties are no longer permitted to propose changes to the proposals. The results of the second round are taken into account, with 330 votes needed to send them to a referendum or 367 for direct implementation. A final vote on all of the approved proposals at large, with the same thresholds, was undertaken at the end of the second round, with the entire process being disbanded if votes in favour fell below 330.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konhaber.com/haber-anayasa_degisikligi_sureci_nasil_isleyecek-640988.html|title=Anayasa değişikliği süreci nasıl işleyecek?  - Konhaber - Türkiye'nin İnternet Gazetesi|website=Konhaber.com|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the total 550 Members of Parliament, 537 were entitled to a vote. 11 MPs from the [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP) were under arrest for terrorism charges and were unable to partake in the vote, with the remaining 48 HDP MPs boycotting the vote after their motion calling for the arrested MPs to be brought to parliament to vote was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diken.com.tr/tutuklu-hdp-vekillerinden-itiraz-anayasa-gorusmeleri-ic-tuzuge-aykiri-durdurun/|title=Tutuklu HDP vekillerinden itiraz: Anayasa görüşmeleri iç tüzüğe aykırı, durdurun - Diken|date=7 January 2017|website=Diken.com.tr|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliamentary Speaker [[İsmail Kahraman]], who is unable to take part in the vote by virtue of being the Speaker, was hospitalised during the vote, meaning that AKP deputy speaker [[Ahmet Aydın]] presided over the proceedings and was therefore unable to cast a vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=İsmail Kahraman hastaneye kaldırıldı!|url=http://www.cagdasses.com/guncel/58624/ismail-kahraman-hastaneye-kaldirildi|agency=Cagdas Ses|date=29 December 2016|language=Turkish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417161134/http://www.cagdasses.com/guncel/58624/ismail-kahraman-hastaneye-kaldirildi|archivedate=17 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 537 MPs eligible to vote, the AKP held 315, the CHP 133, the MHP 39, the HDP 48 and 2 were independent. Of the MHP's 39 MPs, 6 had openly stated that they would vote against the amendments, leaving the total number of MPs expected to vote 'Yes' at 348. The CHP's 133 MPs and the two independents, which consisted of [[Aylin Nazlıaka]] and [[Ümit Özdağ]], voted 'No' while the HDP boycotted the votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Başkanlık sisteminin ilk oylamasında fire hesabı|url=https://tr.sputniknews.com/turkiye/201701101026704224-baskanlik-sistem-oylama-fire/|agency=Sputnik Turkiye|date=10 January 2017|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliamentary voting began on 9 January, with the first round of voting being completed on 15 January. Opposition politicians criticised the rushed way in which the votes were conducted, with four to five votes taking place in a day with no adjournments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internethaber.com/baykaldan-cok-sert-anayasa-cikisi-1745505h.htm|title=Baykal'dan çok sert anayasa çıkışı|website=Interethaber.com|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The votes were marred by numerous irregularities, with CHP Members of Parliament filming AKP MPs openly casting their vote or intimidating uncertain MPs to vote 'Yes'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://nediyor.com/chpli-ozkanin-oylamaya-mudahale-isyani/ |title=CHP'li Özkan'ın oylamaya müdahale isyanı |website=Nediyor.com |date=9 January 2017 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://tr.sputniknews.com/bidebunudinle/201701101026712149-akparti-orhan-deligiz-anayasa-oylamasi-acik-oy/ |title=AK Partili Deligöz: 'Ulan alın açık oy kullanıyorum, ne yapacaksınız?' dedim |website=Tr.sputniknews.com |date=16 January 2017 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minister of Health, [[Recep Akdağ]], was filmed casting an open vote, which is disallowed by the constitution, and openly admitting that he had committed a crime afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/video/video/657859/AKP_liler_acik_oy_kullandi_ortalik_karisti...__Saglik_Bakani_Akdag__Sana_mi_soracagim_lan_.html |title=Cumhuriyet Gazetesi - (Video) AKP'liler açık oy kullandı ortalık karıştı...

The amendments were received with heavy criticism from opposition parties and non-governmental organisations, with criticism focusing particularly on the erosion of the [[separation of powers]] and the abolition of parliamentary accountability. Constitutional legal experts such as Kemal Gözler and İbrahim Kaboğlu claimed that the changes would result in the Parliament becoming effectively powerless, while the executive president would have controls over the executive, legislative, and judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anayasa.gen.tr/elveda-anayasa-v1.htm|title=Kemal Gözler, Kuvvetler Ayrılığı, Elveda Anayasa: 10 Aralık 2016 Tarihli Anayasa Değişikliği Teklifi Hakkında Bİr Eleştiri|website=Anayasa.gen.tr|accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://tr.sputniknews.com/politika/201612271026505410-akp-anayasa-padisah-kaboglu/ |title='AKP'nin anayasa teklifi en büyük kırılma, padişahlık ötesi bir durum söz konusu' |website=Tr.sputniknews.com |date=27 December 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 December, the [[Atatürkist Thought Association]] (ADD), [[Association for the Support of Contemporary Living]] (ÇYDD) and the Trade Union Confederation held a rally in [[Ankara]] despite having their permissions revoked by the [[Governor of Ankara]], calling for a rejection of the executive presidential system on the grounds that it threatened judicial independence and secular democratic values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://add.org.tr/4-aralikta-baskanliga-dur-demek-icin-anitkabirdeydik/ |title=HALK BAŞKANLIK SİSTEMİNE "HAYIR" DİYEREK ANITKABİR’E YÜRÜDÜ - Atatürkçü Düşünce Derneği |date=29 December 2016 |publisher= |accessdate=16 April 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229033636/http://add.org.tr/4-aralikta-baskanliga-dur-demek-icin-anitkabirdeydik/ |archivedate=29 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendments were initially received with mixed responses from the opposition CHP, which have long been critical of the AKP's constitutional plans. Shortly after the proposals were made public and submitted to Parliament on 10 December, Prime Minister [[Binali Yıldırım]] reported that the CHP was in agreement with 5 of the proposed changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marmaragazetesi.com/basbakan-yildirimdan-yeni-anayasa-teklifiyle-ilgili-ilk-aciklama-chpnin-de-mutabik-o-118020h.htm |title=Başbakan Yıldırım'dan Yeni Anayasa Teklifiyle İlgili İlk Açıklama: CHP'nin de Mutabık Olduğu Maddeler Var |website=Marmaragazetesi.com |date= |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, reception by the CHP was negative, with the party's deputy leader [[Selin Sayek Böke]] claiming that the proposals essentially created a "[[sultanate]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://tr.sputniknews.com/politika/201612111026258592-chp-selin-sayek-boke-anayasa-teklifi/ |title=CHP'li Böke: Meclis'e sunulan padişahlık teklifidir |website=Tr.sputniknews.com |date= |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliamentary group leader [[Levent Gök]], one of the first to comment on the released proposals, claimed that the changes would revert 140 years of Turkish parliamentary democracy, calling on all parties to reject the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nursima Keskin |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/chpden-anayasa-teklifine-iliskin-ilk-aciklama-40303012 |title=CHP'den anayasa teklifine ilişkin ilk açıklama - Son Dakika Gündem Haberleri |website=Hurriyet.com.tr |date= |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the CHP's parliamentary group leaders,  [[Özgür Özel]], called the proposals a "regime change", with the parliament being left essentially powerless in scrutinising ministers and holding them to account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/video/video_haber/649071/CHP_li_Ozgur_Ozel_den_baskanlik_karsiti__kefenli_hodri_meydan__konusmasi.html |title=Cumhuriyet Gazetesi - (Video) CHP'li Özgür Özel'den başkanlık karşıtı "kefenli hodri meydan" konuşması |website=Cumhuriyet.com.tr |date=22 December 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Özel claimed that the AKP were unlikely to obtain the 330 votes necessary to put the changes to a referendum, stating that he would be surprised if the number of MPs voting in favour reached 275.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/chp-li-ozgur-ozel-275-in-uzerine-cikamazlar-139010.html |title=CHP'li Özgür Özel: 275'in üzerine çıkamazlar |website=Birgun.net |date=10 December 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CHP MP [[Selina Doğan]] claimed that the authoritarian nature of the proposals would effectively end [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey's EU accession negotiations]], citing the lack of any relevance to European values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensonhaber.com/chpli-dogan-anayasa-teklifi-yasalasirsa-ab-sureci-biter-2016-12-28.html |title=CHP'li Doğan: Anayasa teklifi yasalaşırsa AB süreci biter |website=Ensonhaber.com |date= |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CHP MP Cemal Oktan Yüksel claimed that the proposals resembled the constitution of [[Bashar Al Assad|Assad]]'s [[Syria]], stating that it wouldn't be a national constitution but "Syria's constitution translated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://t24.com.tr/haber/chpli-vekil-bu-teklif-diktator-esadin-suriye-anayasasinin-kopyasi-dedi-karsilastirmali-metin-sundu,378834 |title=CHP'li vekil "Bu teklif, diktatör Esad'ın Suriye anayasasının kopyası" dedi, karşılaştırmalı metin sundu - Politika |publisher=T24 |date= |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having the nationalist MHP's official support, it was reported that Turkish nationalists were also overwhelmingly critical of both the proposals and their party's involvement in their drafting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/yeni-anayasa-teklifi-ulkuculeri-ayaga-kaldirdi-152555h.htm |title=Yeni Anayasa teklifi Ülkücüleri ayağa kaldırdı |website=Yenicaggazetesi.com.tr |date= |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahçeli, who has historically lent support to the AKP in controversial situations, was subject to criticism from all major parties for his decision to support the constitutional amendments, being described as the AKP's "back garden", "life-line" or "spare tyre" by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diken.com.tr/chpnin-sarayin-yedek-lastigi-sozlerine-mhpden-yanit-pkknin-don-lastigi/ |title=CHP'nin ‘Saray’ın yedek lastiği’ sözlerine MHP'den yanıt: PKK’nın don lastiği |publisher=Diken |date=14 October 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/chp-li-gok-mhp-akp-ye-can-simidi/siyaset/detay/2206328/default.htm |title=CHP'li Gök: MHP, AKP'ye can simidi olmuş - Haberler |website=Milliyet.com.tr |date= |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazete2023.com/siyaset/ulkuculer-mhp-yi-akp-nin-arka-bahcesi-yaptirmayacak-h54576.html |title=Ülkücüler MHP'yi AKP'nin arka bahçesi yaptırmayacak |website=Gazete2023.com |date=16 October 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October 2016, 5 of the 40 MHP Members of Parliament declared that they would reject the constitutional proposals, against their party line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntv.com.tr/turkiye/mhpli-5-milletvekili-baskanlik-teklifine-hayir-diyecek,kYMnwxBvGEaajwVqNBFFJA |title=MHP'li 5 milletvekili '&amp;#39;başkanlık'&amp;#39; teklifine '&amp;#39;hayır'&amp;#39; diyecek |publisher=NTV |date=24 October 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ümit Özdağ]], who was a leadership candidate against Bahçeli and one of the 5 MPs critical of the changes, had his party membership revoked in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haberturk.com/gundem/haber/1324638-mhpden-ihrac-edilen-umit-ozdag-konustu |title=MHP'den ihraç edilen Ümit Özdağ konuştu &amp;#124; Gündem Haberleri |website=Haberturk.com |date=16 November 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll released by Gezici in December showed that almost two-thirds of MHP supporters were against the proposed changes, though MHP supporters were also the most undecided amongst the other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2016/gundem/yeni-anayasa-anketinden-cok-konusulacak-sonuclar-1590584/ |title=Yeni Anayasa anketinden çok konuşulacak sonuçlar – Sözcü Gazetesi |website=Sozcu.com.tr |date=28 December 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 December, MHP MP Kadir Koçdemir became the fifth MP from his party to publicly state his opposition to the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://61hayat.com/tr-TR/haberler/15439/mhpli-vekil-tweet-atti-anayasa-hesabi-karisti |title=MHP'li vekil tweet attı, Anayasa hesabı karıştı! - 61 Hayat İnternet Gazetesi |website=61hayat.com |date= |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking shortly after the proposals were released, the HDP's spokesperson [[Ayhan Bilgen]] criticised the proposed changes for being anti-democratic and against the principle of judicial independence. Citing the proposed creation of "executive orders" that can be decreed by the President at will without parliamentary scrutiny, Bilgen criticised the nature of the changes, calling them poorly written and an attempt to cover up constitutional violations that had taken place under the current constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haberturk.com/gundem/haber/1335019-hdpden-yeni-anayasa-teklifi-aciklamasi |title=HDP'den yeni anayasa teklifi açıklaması &amp;#124; Gündem Haberleri |website=Haberturk.com |date= |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 18 December, HDP MP Kadri Yıldırım claimed that there would be no reason to reject the proposals if the changes included a separate "status" for Turkish Kurds and a constitutional entitlement to education for Kurdish citizens in their native [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/647436/HDP_li_Yildirim_dan_baskanlik_sistemi_icin_iki_sart.html |title=HDP'li Yıldırım'dan başkanlık sistemi için iki şart - Cumhuriyet Siyaset Haberleri |website=Cumhuriyet.com.tr |date=18 December 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to speculation that the HDP could be convinced to support the changes by the AKP government, though the MHP would be unlikely to jointly support any changes that are also endorsed by the HDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2016/yazarlar/can-atakli/baskanlik-sistemine-hdp-bombasi-1575649/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229170912/http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2016/yazarlar/can-atakli/baskanlik-sistemine-hdp-bombasi-1575649/ |archivedate=29 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 December, the CHP and HDP issued a parliamentary motion that would declare the proposals "unconstitutional", but the motion was rejected by MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://tr.sputniknews.com/turkiye/201612211026421091-chp-hdp-anayasa/ |title=CHP ve HDP'nin 'değişiklik teklifi Anayasa'ya aykırı' önergeleri kabul edilmedi |website=Tr.sputniknews.com |date=21 December 2016 |accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes have also received severe criticism from outside Turkey. One commentator went as far as to declare that "if a majority votes yes, this will be the end of parliamentary democracy in Turkey."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/14/turkey-constitution-referendum-despotism-erdogan-crush-opposition|title=Turkey could be about to leap from division to despotism|date=2017-04-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-15|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NGO]] [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that the changes were a "huge threat to human rights, the rule of law, and the country’s democratic future."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/18/turkey-president-bids-one-man-rule|title=Turkey: President Bids for One-Man Rule|date=2017-01-18|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-04-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Economist'' concluded that "a vote for Yes would saddle the country with an elected dictator." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/|title=The Economist - World News, Politics, Economics, Business &amp; Finance|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Venice Commission]] of the [[Council of Europe]], in its March 2017 Opinion on the Constitutional amendments, defined them as "a threat to democracy" and stressed the "dangers of degeneration of the proposed system towards and authoritarian and personal regime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/?pdf=CDL-AD(2017)005-e|title=Venice Commission :: Council of Europe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, before the vote took place, the [[openDemocracy]] website reported that some European news outlets published concerns that the 2017 referendum amounted to something like an "[[enabling act]]" for Erdoğan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/franck-d-vell/does-turkey-s-ongoing-purge-resemble-1933-enabling-act-in-nazi-germ |title=Does Turkey’s ongoing purge resemble the 1933 Enabling Act in Nazi Germany? |last=Düvell |first=Franck |date=March 28, 2017 |website=opendemocracy.net |publisher=OpenDemocracy |access-date=April 17, 2017 |quote=The constitutional reform in Turkey of 2016 and the conditions under which it is being pushed through recall legal procedures like the Enabling Act 1933 by which the Nazis came to power in Germany in the 1930s. This has been noted by many international and in particular German, Austrian and Swiss media including ‘Die Tagesschau’, ‘Der Standard’ and ‘Neue Zuricher Zeitung’. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign positions==
Ruling party AKP and opposition MHP are the signatories of the amendments. MHP has provided their conditional support until their conditions are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=İşte MHP'nin başkanlık şartları|url=http://www.ulusalkanal.com.tr/gundem/iste-mhp-nin-baskanlik-sartlari-h125292.html|publisher=[[Ulusal Kanal]]|accessdate=29 October 2016|language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Main opposition CHP's initial position was to wait until the amendments were finalized. CHP leader Kılıçdaroğlu once mentioned of bringing the changes into Grand Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kılıçdaroğlu, 'başkanlık' için Meclis'i bekleyecek: Hele bir gelsin görelim - Diken|url=http://www.diken.com.tr/kilicdaroglu-baskanlik-icin-meclisi-bekleyecek-hele-bir-gelsin-gorelim/|website=Diken|accessdate=11 December 2016|language=tr|date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, CHP decided to favor No vote and started "Türkiye'yi Böldürmeyeceğiz" ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''We'll not partition Turkey'') rallies. Parliament's fourth party HDP is against the changes.

{{main|2017 Turkish constitutional referendum 'Yes' campaign}}
The 'Yes' campaign has been predominantly led by [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) politicians, as well as [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP) politicians loyal to leader [[Devlet Bahçeli]]. Initially expecting a 7 February start to the campaign, the AKP eventually kicked off their official campaign on 25 February with a presentation by Prime Minister [[Binali Yıldırım]] at the [[Ankara]] sports stadium. Amid poor showings in opinion polls in February, Erdoğan reportedly asked pro-government pollsters to suspend their opinion polling until the end of March, while proposals for a joint electoral rally by both leading AKP and MHP politicians has also been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazetevatan.com/ak-parti-ve-mhp-nin-ilk-ortak-mitingi-canakkale-de-1040271-siyaset/ |title=AKP ve MHP'nin ilk ortak mitingi Çanakkale'de &amp;#124; Siyaset Haberleri |publisher=Gazetevatan.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Yes' campaign has been criticised for its smear campaign against individuals voting 'No', associating them with numerous terrorist organisations. Prime Minister [[Binali Yıldırım]] claiming that they would vote 'Yes' because the [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK) and the so-called [[Fethullah Gülen Terrorist Organisation]] (FETÖ) were voting 'No', though both organisations have historically been in favour of an executive presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/turkiye/671005/Binali_Yildirim__PKK__FETO__HDP__Hayir__diyor_onun_icin__Evet__diyoruz.html|title=Binali Yıldırım: PKK, FETO, HDP 'Hayır' diyor onun için 'Evet' diyoruz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] also caused controversy when he claimed that those voting 'No' were siding with the coup plotters behind the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2017/gundem/erdogan-hayir-diyenleri-darbeci-ilan-etti-1675847/ |title=Erdoğan ‘hayır’ diyenleri darbeci ilan etti – Sözcü Gazetesi |publisher=Sozcu.com.tr |date=2017-02-13 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, the 'Yes' campaign has been conducted through electoral rallies held by Prime Minister Yıldırım, leading AKP politicians and also President Erdoğan, who has held 'public opening' rallies similar to his tactics in the [[Turkish general election, June 2015|June 2015 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=21:11 |url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2017/02/17/cumhurbaskani-erdogan-kahramanmarasta-1487360761 |title=Cumhurbaşkanı Erdoğan Kahramanmaraş'ta - Son Dakika Haberler |publisher=Sabah.com.tr |date=2017-02-17 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; MHP leader [[Devlet Bahçeli]] has conducted conferences in favour of a 'Yes' vote, with the first occurring in [[Konya]] on 12 February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensonhaber.com/mhp-lideri-devlet-bahceli-konyada-2017-02-11.html |title=MHP lideri Devlet Bahçeli Konya'da |publisher=Ensonhaber.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 March, the [[Great Union Party]] (BBP) led by [[Mustafa Destici]] announced that they would support a 'Yes' vote, bringing the total number of parties supporting 'Yes' to six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dunya.com/gundem/bbp-referandum-kararini-acikladi-haberi-353185 |title=BBP, referandum kararını açıkladı &amp;#124; Gündem |publisher=Dunya.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the BBP and MHP have suffered serious opposition to their support for a 'Yes' vote, with BBP members calling for Destici's resignation following his announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/sivasta-desticiye-referandum-protestosu-158749h.htm |title=Sivas’ta Destici’ye referandum protestosu |publisher=Yenicaggazetesi.com.tr |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MHP suffered a wave of resignations, inner-party suspensions and a rival 'No' campaign run by high-profile nationalist politicians, with opinion polls indicating that a significant majority of MHP voters intend to vote against the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/mhp-de-hayircilar-dan-toplu-istifa-144337.html |title=MHP'de, 'hayırcılar'dan toplu istifa |publisher=Birgun.net |date=2017-01-24 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/turkiye/mhpde-toplu-istifa01 |title=MHP'de toplu istifa - CNN TÜRK - tarafsız güvenilir haberler |publisher=Cnnturk.com |date=2017-01-21 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sözcü Ankara |url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2017/gundem/mhp-yonetiminden-toplu-istifa-1647781/ |title=MHP yönetiminde art arda istifalar! – Sözcü Gazetesi |publisher=Sozcu.com.tr |date=2017-01-28 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most polls put the percentage of 'No' voters in the MHP at between 50% to 80%, with definite 'Yes' voters remaining at 20-25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/mhplilerin-yuzde-501i-hayir-yuzde-247si-evet-diyor-kalanlar-kararsiz,384575 |title="MHP'lilerin yĂźzde 50,1'i 'HayÄąr', yĂźzde 24.7'si 'Evet' diyor; kalanlar kararsÄąz" - GĂźndem |publisher=T24 |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/mhp-nin-yuzde-80-i-hayir-diyecek-147974.html |title='MHP'nin yüzde 80'i hayır diyecek' |publisher=Birgun.net |date=2017-02-23 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Politicians supporting 'No' from both the MHP and BBP have claimed that over 95% of their party supporters are favouring a 'No' vote, breaking with their party's executive decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/bbpde-referandum-catlagi-genel-baskan-evet-yuksek-istisare-kurulu-baskani-hayir,392964 |title=BBP'de 'referandum' Ă§atlaÄ&amp;#x;Äą - GĂźndem |publisher=T24 |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2017/gundem/mhpli-halacoglu-mhpnin-yuzde-90i-hayir-oyu-verecek-1709803 |title=MHP’li Halaçoğlu: MHP’nin yüzde 90’ı ‘hayır’ oyu verecek – Sözcü Gazetesi |publisher=Sozcu.com.tr |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kılıçdaroğlu referandum Diyarbakır 2017.jpg|thumb|CHP leader [[Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu]] addressing a 'No' rally in [[Diyarbakır]]]]

The CHP unveiled their campaign logo and slogan on 28 February, using the slogan 'Geleceğim için Hayır' (translating to ''No for my future''). The party planned their first electoral rally in [[Amasya]], though preliminary rallies were held by party leader [[Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu]] on 21 December 2016 in [[Adana]] and by dissident MP [[Muharrem İnce]] on 8 March 2017 at [[Zonguldak]]. CHP MPs also made a series of overseas visits to rally support from overseas voters, with former leader [[Deniz Baykal]] holding an event in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deniz Baykal Fransa'da 'hayır' istedi|url=http://www.ensonhaber.com/deniz-baykal-fransada-hayir-istedi-2017-03-07.html|agency=En Son Haber|date=7 March 2017|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-profile dissident MHP politicians, such as [[Meral Akşener]], [[Sinan Oğan]], [[Ümit Özdağ]], and [[Yusuf Halaçoğlu]] all began a 'No' campaign based on [[Turkish nationalism]], rivalling the MHP's official 'Yes' campaign. The dissident 'No' campaign attracted significantly higher popularity than the MHP's official 'Yes' events, with opinion polls indicating that an overwhelming majority of MHP voters intend to break the party line and vote 'No'. In addition to the MHP dissidents, the [[Turkish Bars Association]] and its President [[Metin Feyzioğlu]] and Leader of "No" Party Leader [[Tuna Beklevic|Tuna Bekleviç]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tr.sputniknews.com/turkiye/201703021027467075-hayir-partisi-yozgatta-referandum-icin-konusmamiz-engellendi/|title=Hayır Partisi: Yozgat’ta referandum için konuşmamız engellendi|last=Sputnik|website=tr.sputniknews.com|language=tr|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/tuerkei-nein-partei-gegen-allmaechtigen-erdogan-gegruendet.795.de.html?dram:article_id=378623|title=Türkei - "Nein"-Partei gegen allmächtigen Erdogan gegründet|work=Deutschlandfunk|access-date=2018-03-11|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Türkei: NEIN-Partei bekämpft Erdogans Präsidentschaftspläne  {{!}} Europamagazin|url=http://www.daserste.de/information/politik-weltgeschehen/europamagazin/sendung/tuerkei-referendum-nein-100.html|language=de-DE|accessdate=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.imaret.com.tr/hayir-partisi-karaman-da-gazetecilerle-bulustu/2705/|title="HAYIR PARTİSİ" KARAMAN'DA GAZETECİLERLE BULUŞTU|work=imaret.com.tr|access-date=2018-03-11|language=tr-TR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/hayir-partisi-nin-kurucusu-beklevic-ak-parti-bitti-cigerini-biliyorum-145364.html|title=Hayır Partisi'nin kurucusu Bekleviç: 'AK Parti bitti, ciğerini|website=www.birgun.net|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; embarked on a nationwide tour, intending to meet with locals in numerous towns and villages to rally support for a 'No' vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=İşimiz ülkenin tapusunu hiç kimseye vermemek!|url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2017/gundem/isimiz-ulkenin-tapusunu-hic-kimseye-vermemek-1750383/|agency=Sozcu|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'No' campaigners have faced alleged government-backed coercion and suppression. On 1 March, the main opposition [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) unveiled a 78-point report regarding irregularities and suppression of 'No' campaigners, with Deputy Leader [[Öztürk Yılmaz]] claiming that those who were campaigning for a 'No' vote faced fear and state coercion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://t24.com.tr/haber/chp-hayir-diyenlere-baskiyi-78-maddeyle-raporladi,391520 |title=CHP, 'hayÄąr' diyenlere baskÄąyÄą 78 maddeyle raporladÄą - GĂźndem |publisher=T24 |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/693113/CHP_li_Ozturk_Yilmaz___Hayir__diyenler_baski_altinda.html|title=CHP'li Öztürk Yılmaz: 'Hayır' diyenler baskı altında|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CHP parliamentary group leader [[Engin Altay]] also criticised the government for using state funds to fund the 'Yes' campaign while repressing 'No' voters, claiming that their conduct did not allow them to talk of 'democracy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/695681/CHP_li_Engin_Altay__Bu_kotu_bir_haber.html|title=CHP'li Engin Altay: Bu kötü bir haber|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and electoral misconduct==
Allegations of electoral misconduct, irregularities throughout the campaign and state coercion of 'No' supporters were widespread prior to, during and after the referendum. European election monitors said the referendum did not meet international standards.&lt;ref name="IrregularWSJ"&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-turkeys-irregular-referendum-1493150990 Inside Turkey’s Irregular Referendum], ''The Wall Street Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

===State suppression of 'No' voters===
The [[65th government of Turkey|AKP government]] and the [[General Directorate of Security]] (police) have both been criticised for employing tactics designed to limit the campaigning abilities of 'No' supporters, through arrests, control of the media and political suppression. On 23 January 2017, university students campaigning for a 'No' vote on a commuter ferry in [[İstanbul]] were implicated by security officers for 'insulting the president', with their arrests being stopped by onboard passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/vapurda-hayir-sarkisi-soyleyen-genclere-gozaltiyi-yolcular-engelledi-144395.html |title=Vapurda 'Hayır' şarkısı söyleyen gençlere gözaltıyı yolcular |publisher=Birgun.net |date=2017-01-24 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January, [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] council member Sera Kadıgil was arrested and later freed on charges of 'insulting religious values and inciting hatred' for campaigning for a 'No' vote on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeteduvar.com.tr/gundem/2017/01/31/hayir-dedigim-icin-alindim-serra-kadigil/ |title='Hayır dediğim için gözaltına alındım' |publisher=Gazeteduvar.com.tr |date=2017-01-31 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bursa]], a voter who revealed that he was voting 'No' was reported to the police and later arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazeteyolculuk.net/bursada-hayir-oyu-verecegini-aciklayan-bir-yurttas-muhbir-vatandas-tarafindan-ihbar-edilerek-tutuklandi |title=Bursa'da 'hayır' oyu vereceğini açıklayan bir yurttaş, 'muhbir vatandaş' tarafından ihbar edilerek tutuklandı |publisher=Gazete Yolculuk |date=2017-03-03 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; National television channels have been vastly in favour of the 'Yes' campaign. One study found that 'Yes' supporters received 90% of airtime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A Turkish court banned a pro-Kurdish [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|Peoples' Democratic Party]] (HDP) song which supported the "No" on the grounds that it contravened the constitution and fomented hatred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mehmet Emin Caliskan |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-referendum-no-campaign/with-media-muzzled-turkish-no-voters-seek-alternative-channels-idUSKBN17D235 |title=With media muzzled, Turkish 'no' voters seek alternative channels |publisher=Reuters.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Municipalities held by pro-'Yes' parties have also sought to limit the campaign events of 'No' voters by denying them rights to hold rallies in public spaces of community halls. [[Meral Akşener]], a leading nationalist politician and one of the most prominent campaigners for a 'No' vote, was stopped from holding speeches when her campaign venues in [[Yalova]] and [[Edirne]] were abruptly shut down shortly before her events, with posters advertising her events in [[Eskişehir]] being ripped down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viratrabzon.com/haber/evet-baskisi-meral-aksenerin-toplanti-afislerini-de-soktuler-33682.html |title=Evet baskısı: Meral Akşener'in toplantı afişlerini de söktüler - www.viratrabzon.com &amp;#124; Trabzon İnternet Gazetesi |publisher=www.viratrabzon.com |date=2017-03-09 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/milliyetcilere-iptal-baski-ve-saldirilar-suruyor-158680h.htm |title=Milliyetçilere iptal, baskı ve saldırılar sürüyor! |publisher=Yenicaggazetesi.com.tr |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 February while she was making a speech at a hotel hall in [[Çanakkale]], the venue suffered a power cut and was perceived by the pro-opposition media to be a symbol of the oppressive tactics against the 'No' campaign. After initially being obstructed by riot police, attendees at the conference used their phone lights to allow the event to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Emrullah Bayrak |url=http://www.ocakmedya.com/genel/2017/02/11/meral-aksenerin-konusma-yaptigi-salonda-elektrikler-kesildi/ |title=Meral Akşener'in konuşma yaptığı salonda elektrikler kesildi |publisher=Ocak Medya |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/meral-aksener-in-hayir-toplantisina-engelleme-146512.html |title=Meral Akşener'in 'hayır' toplantısına engelleme |publisher=Birgun.net |date=2017-02-11 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Barış Yarkadaş |url=http://www.gercekgundem.com/siyaset/257464/meral-aksenere-engelleme-girisimi |title=Meral Akşener'e engelleme girişimi - Gerçek Gündem |publisher=Gercekgundem.com |date=2017-02-11 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overseas 'Yes' campaign bans===
[[Diaspora politics|Overseas election campaigning]], even in diplomatic missions, is illegal under [[Turkish law]].&lt;ref name=illegal1&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkish law prohibits campaigning abroad - as row with Europe deepens|url=http://www.dpa-international.com/topic/turkish-law-prohibits-campaigning-abroad-row-europe-deepens-170309-99-595734|publisher=[[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]]|accessdate=13 March 2017|last1=Gold|first1=Shabtai|last2=Merey|first2=Can|last3=Say|first3=Linda}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=illegal2&gt;{{cite web|title=Host of ‘political’ Turkish rally in Austria scraps event after police see ‘no legal grounds’ to act|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/12/c_136123094.htm|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, most political parties in Turkey, including CHP and the ruling AKP, have broken the law.{{how|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref name=illegal1/&gt;&lt;ref name=illegal2/&gt;

[[File:Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu statement on Germany, 2017.png|thumb|Foreign minister [[Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu]] making a statement following the cancellation of campaign events in [[Germany]]]]
In early March, pro-'YES' campaigners, including high-profile AKP government ministers were barred from holding campaign events in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]], and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/danimarka-yildirim-dan-ziyareti-iptal-etmesini-istedi-150553.html |title=Danimarka, Yıldırım'dan ziyareti iptal etmesini istedi |publisher=Birgun.net |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
In Germany, local municipalities withdrew permits for Justice Minister [[Bekir Bozdağ]]'s campaign event in [[Gaggenau]] and Economy Minister [[Nihat Zeybekçi]]'s event in [[Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sozcu.com.tr |url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2017/dunya/son-dakika-almanya-bekir-bozdaga-verdigi-izni-geri-cekti-1709980/ |title=Almanya Bekir Bozdağ’a verdiği miting iznini geri çekti – Sözcü Gazetesi |publisher=Sozcu.com.tr |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While authorities cited security concerns, the insufficient capacities of the rented venues and irregularities in the organisational process, the Turkish government strongly condemned the cancellations and claimed that they were directly linked to an anti-Turkish agenda of the German federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Birazdan 20:41 - 21:00 VOA - TGRT Haber |url=http://www.amerikaninsesi.com/a/turkiyeden-almanyaya-skandal-ve-cifte-standart-tepkisi/3748249.html |title=Türkiye’den Almanya’ya 'Skandal ve Çifte Standart' Tepkisi |language=tr|publisher=Amerikaninsesi.com |date=2017-03-03 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish foreign minister [[Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu]] claimed that Germany had showed 'double standards' and a disregard for 'human rights and freedom of speech' by cancelling the events. Following a negative reaction by the German federal government to a proposed rally by [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], Erdoğan accused Germany of '[[Nazi]]-style tactics', causing strong condemnation by German officials and a souring of diplomatic relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Birazdan 20:41 - 21:00 VOA - TGRT Haber |url=http://www.amerikaninsesi.com/a/erdoganin-nazi-benzetmesine-almanyadan-yanit/3751238.html |title=Erdoğan'ın Nazi Benzetmesine Almanya'dan Yanıt |language=tr|publisher=Amerikaninsesi.com |date=2017-03-06 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish government also accused Germany of funding and supporting the [[Kurdistan Workers Party]] (PKK), which is designated as a terrorist organisation in both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Birazdan 20:41 - 21:00 VOA - TGRT Haber |url=http://www.amerikaninsesi.com/a/erdogan-almanyayi-terore-yardim-ve-yataklikta-sucladi/3748898.html |title=Erdoğan Almanya’yı Teröre Yardım ve Yataklıkla Suçladı |language=tr|publisher=Amerikaninsesi.com |date=2017-03-03 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu]] was due to meet his German counterpart on 8 March, with scheduled campaign speeches in [[Hamburg]] also being cancelled due to irregularities with the venues. Çavuşoğlu therefore made his speech in the Hamburg consulate, despite Turkish law forbidding election campaigns in diplomatic missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Birazdan 20:41 - 21:00 VOA - TGRT Haber |url=http://www.amerikaninsesi.com/a/cavusoglu-hamburg-konusmasini-baskonsolosluk-rezidansinda-yapacak/3753707.html |title=Çavuşoğlu Hamburg Konuşmasını Başkonsolosluk Rezidansında Yapacak |language=tr|publisher=Amerikaninsesi.com |date=2017-03-07 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cancellations in Germany were met by condemnation from the main opposition and pro-'No' Republican People's Party, with former leader [[Deniz Baykal]] cancelling a planned visit to Germany as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Birazdan 20:41 - 21:00 VOA - TGRT Haber |url=http://www.amerikaninsesi.com/a/baykal-dan-almanya-gezisi-iptal-aciklamasi/3753886.html |title=Baykal'dan Almanya Gezisi İptal Açıklaması |language=tr|publisher=Amerikaninsesi.com |date=2017-03-07 |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Diplomatic crisis with the Netherlands====
[[File:Turkey Holland referendum protests 2.jpg|thumb|Pro-'Yes' protests outside the Dutch embassy in Turkey following the [[2017 Dutch–Turkish diplomatic incident|Dutch–Turkish diplomatic crisis]]]]
{{see|2017 Dutch–Turkish diplomatic incident}}
A diplomatic crisis occurred between [[Netherlands–Turkey relations|Turkey and the Netherlands]] on 11 March, after Çavuşoğlu's official plane had its permission to land revoked mid-air ahead of a scheduled campaign speech. Later that day, Families and Social Policy Minister [[Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya]]'s convoy was stopped by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] police, which blocked her access to the Turkish consulate in [[Rotterdam]]. Kaya was later declared [[persona non grata]], with a regional [[state of emergency]] being declared and her convoy being asked to leave the country. Kaya was therefore forced to return to [[Germany]], while Çavuşoğlu left for [[France]] to attend another campaign event. Violent protests by Turkish expats broke out in Rotterdam following the expulsion of both ministers, with the police making 12 arrests.&lt;ref name="haber1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haber7.com/dunya/haber/2279496-hollanda-gozalti-sayisini-acikladi |title=Hollanda gözaltı sayısını açıkladı! - DÜNYA Haberleri |publisher=Haber7.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch government had previously asked Turkish ministers to refrain from campaigning in the country, fearing that divisive campaign rhetoric would sow divisions within the Turkish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/hollanda-basbakani-ruttedan-yeni-aciklama-158964h.htm |title=Hollanda Başbakanı Rutte'dan yeni açıklama |publisher=Yenicaggazetesi.com.tr |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Mark Rutte]] claimed that negotiations with the Turkish government to allow a small scale speech by the minister were still ongoing, when Çavuşoğlu publicly threatened with sanctions should ministers be prevented from campaigning. It was these threats that made the situation unsolvable to the Dutch government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milliyet.com.tr/hollanda-basbakani-rutte-den-iptal-dunya-2411809/ |title=Hollanda Başbakanı Rutte'den iptal kararıyla ilgili açıklama - Dünya Haberleri |publisher=Milliyet.com.tr |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people in Turkey took the side of the Turkish government in the matter, with the pro-'No' main opposition announcing their support for the government and calling on the AKP to freeze diplomatic relations with the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/turkiye/son-dakika-kilicdaroglu-hollanda-ile-iliskilerinizi-askiya-alin |title=Son dakika Kılıçdaroğlu: Hollanda ile ilişkilerinizi askıya alın - CNN TÜRK - tarafsız güvenilir haberler |publisher=Cnnturk.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; All CHP overseas campaign events were later suspended in solidarity, while the pro-'No' MHP dissident camp also expressed their condemnation against the Dutch government for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcgazetesi.com/meral-aksenerden-hollanda-yorumu-avrupaya-dovdurmeyiz-46635h.htm |title=Meral Akşener'den Hollanda yorumu: Avrupa'ya dövdürmeyiz |publisher=Abcgazetesi.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haber1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haber.sol.org.tr/toplum/kilicdaroglu-hollandaya-kizdi-chp-tum-yurtdisi-programini-iptal-etti-188580 |title=Kılıçdaroğlu Hollanda'ya kızdı, CHP tüm yurtdışı programını iptal etti &amp;#124; soL Haber Portalı |language=tr|publisher=Haber.sol.org.tr |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the Dutch parliament all parties, except for the two-seat [[Denk (political party)|Denk]] party, supported the decisions of the Dutch Government. [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] reiterated his claim that European governments that suspended campaigning were 'Nazi remnants', which the Dutch government denounced as "unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39242707 |title=Turkey's Erdoğan calls Dutch authorities 'Nazi remnants' - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unstamped ballots===
On the referendum day, while the voting was underway, the [[Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey]] lifted a rule that required each ballot to have an official stamp. Instead, it ruled that ballots with no stamp would be considered valid, unless there was proof that they were fraudulent. It is stated {{By whom|date=June 2018}} that the mistake of the electoral board in the schools cannot cancel the constitutional right of voting of the citizens. Similar decisions {{which|date=June 2018}} have been made in the past, too.  Because ballots have not only stamps but other security measures {{which|date=June 2018}} in place, it doesn't make them illegitimate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ysk.gov.tr/ysk/content/conn/YSKUCM/path/Contribution%20Folders/Kararlar/2017-560.pdf|title=Yüksek Seçim Kurulu 560 No'lu Kararı|last=|first=|date=|website=Yüksek Seçim Kurulu|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey|Supreme Electoral Council]] filed a criminal complaint for the officials that caused the problem by not stamping the ballots.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ysk.gov.tr/cs/groups/public/documents/document/ndq0/mdiz/~edisp/yskpwcn1_4444023324.pdf|title=Yüksek Seçim Kurulu 573 No'lu Kararı|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition parties claim that as many as 1.5 million ballots without a stamp were accepted.&lt;ref name=WaPo1&gt;{{cite news|date=16 April 2017|title=Here’s why Turkish opposition parties are contesting the referendum results|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/04/16/heres-why-turkish-opposition-parties-are-contesting-the-referendum-results/|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition parties [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|CHP]] and [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|HDP]] have said they will contest the results.

The '''Yarovaya law''' ([[Russian language|rus]]. ''Закон Яровой''), also '''Yarovaya package/bag''', refers to a pair of [[Russia]]n [[federal law|federal bills]], 374-FZ and 375-FZ, passed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.garant.ru/news/782190/&lt;/ref&gt; The bills amend a pre-existing [[counter-terrorism]] law and separate laws regulating additional counter-terror and public safety measures. It is known to the public under the last name of one of its creators—[[Irina Yarovaya]].

Among the amendments included an expansion of authority for law enforcement agencies, new requirements for data collection and mandatory deciphering in the telecommunications industry, and increased regulation of [[evangelism]], including a ban on the performance of "missionary activities" in non-religious settings. 

== Legislative history ==
In April 2016 [[Irina Yarovaya]], together with [[Aleksey Pushkov|Aleksei Pushkov]], and Nadezhda Gerasimova and [[Federation Council (Russia)|senator]] Victor Ozerov introduced a project of legislation that would toughen penalties for [[extremism]] and [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/main.nsf/%28SpravkaNew%29?OpenAgent&amp;RN=1039149-6&amp;02|title=Законопроект № 1039149-6|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=Russian|access-date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 May 2016, the act passed after the first reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vote.duma.gov.ru/vote/94599|title=(первое чтение) О проекте федерального закона № 1039101-6 "О внесении изменений в Уголовный кодекс Российской Федерации и Уголовно-процессуальный кодекс Российской Федерации в части установления дополнительных мер противодействия терроризму и обеспечения общественной безопасности" – Система анализа результатов голосований на заседаниях Государственной Думы|last=|first=|date=|website=vote.duma.gov.ru|publisher=|language=Russian|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, it had received support from the [[Dmitry Medvedev's First Cabinet|prime minister's cabinet]]. On 7 July it was signed by the [[President of Russia]], [[Vladimir Putin]].

Most of the act's amendments came into effect on 20 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rusbase.com/opinion/yarovaya-pack/|title=Под закон Яровой подпадают все облачные сервисы и интернет-магазины {{!}} Rusbase|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=Russian|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amendments that require telecom operators to [[Telecommunications data retention|store]] recordings of phone conversations, text messages and users' internet traffic up to 6 months were announced to come into place on 1 July 2018; however, senator Anton Belyakov has submitted a proposal to move the regulations' start date to 2023, because of the extreme amount of [[Computer data storage|data storage technology]] needed to make fulfilling the requirements possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/19jul2016/antiyarovaya.html|title=В Совете Федерации предложили перенести вступление в силу "пакета Яровой" на 2023 год|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=Russian|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

=== Penal provisions ===
The amendments of the Yarovaya law include lengthening of prison terms for a number of criminal activities, introduction of new reasons to deny entry or departure to and from [[Russia]], and the introduction of criminal liability for failure to report to law enforcement authorities that someone else "has been planning, is perpetrating, or has perpetrated" terrorist activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/23/draconian-law-rammed-through-russian-parliament|title=Draconian Law Rammed Through Russian Parliament|last=|first=|date=2016-06-23|website=Human Rights Watch|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kommersant.ru/doc/2984588|title=Борьбу Ирины Яровой с терроризмом подвергли критике|last=Самохина|first=Софья|date=|work=|access-date=2016-08-10|last2=Самохина|first2=Софья|issue=82|pages=3|language=Russian|via=|newspaper=Газета "Коммерсантъ"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveillance provisions===
The Yarovaya amendments require telecom providers to store the content of voice calls, data, images and text messages for 6 months, and the [[metadata]] on them (e.g. time, location, and sender and recipients of messages) for 3 years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Online services such as messaging services, email and social networks that use encrypted data are required to permit the [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB) to access and read their encrypted communications.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.interfax.ru/russia/519643|title=ФСБ избавила мессенджеры от сертификации средств шифрования по "закону Яровой"|date=2016-07-20|work=Interfax.ru|access-date=2017-07-20|language=ru-RU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet and telecom companies are required to disclose these communications and metadata, as well as "all other information necessary" to authorities on request and without a court order.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/07/12/russia-big-brother-law-harms-security-rights|title=Russia: ‘Big Brother’ Law Harms Security, Rights|date=2016-07-12|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-07-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-evangelism provisions===
The amendments also include new restrictions on [[evangelism]] and [[missionary work]].&lt;ref name="cp-fasting"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thousands Fasting After Russian President Putin Signs Law Banning Evangelism Outside of Churches|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/thousands-fasting-after-russian-president-putin-signs-law-banning-evangelism-outside-of-churches-166345/|website=Christian Post|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendments add a new provision to Russia's Religion Legislation, stating that "missionary activity" may only be performed "without hindrance" at churches and other religious sites designated by the chapter. It is explicitly banned from residential buildings. "Missionary activity" is defined as&lt;blockquote&gt;The activity of a religious association, aimed at disseminating information about its [[Religious belief|beliefs]] among [[Non-believer|people who are not participants (members, followers) in that religious association]], with the purpose of involving these people as participants (members, followers). It is carried out directly by religious associations or by citizens and/or legal entities authorised by them, publicly, with the help of the media, the internet or other lawful means".&lt;ref name="f18-evangelism"&gt;{{cite web|title=RUSSIA: Putin signs sharing beliefs, "extremism", punishments|url=http://forum18.org/archive.php?article_id=2197|website=[[Forum 18]]|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Missionary activities may not be used to pursue violations of public safety, "the motivation of citizens to refuse to fulfil their civic duties as established by law and to commit other illegal acts", [[suicide]], or the refusal of medical treatment on religious grounds as aims.&lt;ref name="f18-evangelism" /&gt;

Missionary activities may only be performed by authorized members of registered religious groups and organizations. A group becomes ineligible to perform missionary activities if they have been banned under a court order for practicing extremism or terrorism, or have been liquidated. Foreign missionaries may only perform missionary activities after registering for a permit from a recognized religious organization.&lt;ref name="f18-evangelism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ct-noevange" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ct-bannowineffect"&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia's Ban on Evangelism Is Now in Effect|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2016/july/russia-ban-evangelism-effect.html|website=Christianity Today|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deseret-bblaw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia's new 'big brother law' has Christians, Muslims and Jews fearing for their religious freedom|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865657712/Russias-new-big-brother-law-has-Christians-Muslims-and-Jews-fearing-for-their-religious-freedom.html?pg=all|website=Deseret News|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens are also required to report unauthorized religious activity to the government or face fines.&lt;ref name="ct-noevange" /&gt;

== Implementation ==
===Surveillance provisions===
Because of unprecedented data storage requirements, implementation of the law has been described as impossible and extremely expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/opinion/articles/2016/06/29/647156-prava-grazhdan|title=Дорогой, неэффективный, нарушающий права граждан|last=|first=|date=2016-06-28|website=Vedomosti|publisher=|language=Russian|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/russia-asks-impossible-its-new-surveillance-laws|title=Russia Asks For The Impossible With Its New Surveillance Laws|date=2016-07-19|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Russian Post]] estimated that the implementation of the law would cost the organization 500 billion [[ruble]]s for initial purchases of equipment and 100 billion rubles yearly.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/08/07/2016/577f82279a79478ad1ed4f96|title="Почта России" оценила исполнение "закона Яровой" в полтриллиона рублей|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=Russian|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.forbes.ru/news/324549-pochte-rossii-pridetsya-potratit-500-mlrd-rublei-na-ispolnenie-zakona-yarovoi|title="Почте России" придется потратить 500 млрд рублей на исполнение "закона Яровой"|website=www.forbes.ru|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of the law by other delivery and freight services was estimated to cost around 180 billion rubles, which is projected to cause 30–40% drop in online number of purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2016/07/13/648971-zakon-yarovoi-logisticheskim|title=Закон Яровой может стоить логистическим компаниям 180 млрд рублей|date=2016-07-12|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell service operators will need 2.2 trillion rubles to comply, which will cause a two- or threefold rise in the cost of mobile services for the consumer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Edward Snowden estimated the combined cost of implementation to be 33 billion dollars and predicted that the overall security levels will be unaffected, despite giant affiliated costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-07/putin-s-anti-terror-law-sends-telecommunications-companies-lower|title=Putin’s ‘Big Brother’ Surveillance Law Criticized by Snowden|last=Khrennikov|first=Ilya|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Putin signed the law, it turned out that equipment that is needed to store all the data is non-existent not only in Russia, but in the world. Because of that Putin has issued a call for government contracts to Russian companies for the required hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/14jul2016/zakonyarovoy.html|title=Достаточного количества оборудования для исполнения "закона Яровой" нет даже за рубежом, сообщили в МЭР|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-evangelism provisions===
A number of missionaries have been subject to arrest for violating the law and, upon conviction, have been fined. Donald and Ruth Ossewaarde, independent missionaries working in [[Oryol]], were fined 40,000 rubles (around $700), prompting the couple to leave the country; Sergei Zhuravlyov, a Ukrainian Reformed Orthodox Church of Christ representative, was arrested for engaging in preaching in [[St. Petersburg]]; and Ebenezer Tuah of [[Ghana]], the leader of the Christ Embassy church, was arrested and fined 50,000 rubles for conducting baptisms at a [[sanatorium]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Woods, [http://www.christiantoday.com/article/us.missionarys.work.ended.by.russias.anti.evangelism.law/94482.htm US missionary's work ended by Russia's anti-evangelism law], ''Christian Today'' (September 2, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 July 2016, Jim Mulcahy, a 72-year-old American pastor who is the Eastern European coordinator for the U.S.-based [[Metropolitan Community Church]], was arrested and deported under the prohibition of missionary activities at non-religious sites, after advertising and holding a "tea party" in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] with an LGBT group. Authorities had targeted Mulcahy under suspicions that he was planning to organize a [[Same-sex marriage in Russia|same-sex wedding]].&lt;ref name="ct-noevange"&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia's Newest Law: No Evangelizing Outside of Church|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2016/june/no-evangelizing-outside-of-church-russia-proposes.html|website=Christianity Today|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tdb-mulcahy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zavadski|first1=Katie|title=Russia Was So Afraid of Gay Marriage, It Kicked Out This Priest|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/07/31/russia-was-so-afraid-of-gay-marriage-it-kicked-out-this-priest.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Levi Bridges |title= American pastor expelled from Russia in LGBT case|newspaper=Washington Post|date=26 July 2016|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/american-pastor-expelled-from-russia-in-lgbt-case/2016/07/26/9b8ac09c-531e-11e6-b652-315ae5d4d4dd_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and protests ==
Russia's largest [[telecommunication]] and internet companies expressed their concerns regarding the negative impacts of the law on their businesses and on the Russian economy on the whole. A [[Change.org]] petition to completely cancel Yarovaya's Act collected over 600,000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macdigger.ru/macall/peticiyu-protiv-zakona-yarovoj-podpisali-500-000-chelovek.html|title=Петицию против "закона Яровой" за четыре дня подписали 500 000 человек {{!}} MacDigger.ru – новости из мира Apple|website=www.macdigger.ru|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian Public Initiative petition has been signed more than 100,000 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.roi.ru/28432/|title=РОИ :: Отменить "закон Яровой"|website=www.roi.ru|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of protests were organized in cities, including in [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Ufa]], [[Kazan]] and [[Volgograd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/26jul2016/mitings.html|title=В российских городах прошли акции против антитеррористического "пакета Яровой"|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 9 August protest in [[Moscow]] has seen over 2,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/09aug2016/yarovayamiting.html|title=В Москве на митинг против "пакета Яровой" пришли около двух тысяч человек|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms of anti-evangelism provisions===
The anti-evangelism provisions of the legislation prompted an outcry of concern and opposition from [[Protestantism in Russia|Russia's Protestant minority]], which makes up about 1% of Russia's population.&lt;ref name="ct-bannowineffect"/&gt; According to experts, the law is likely to be interpreted in a way so as to block churches other than the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] evangelizing to [[ethnic Russians]].&lt;ref name="ct-bannowineffect"/&gt; Religious denominations with a smaller presence in Russia have long been viewed with hostility from government officials and Russian Orthodox religious authorities.The harsh new restrictions on minority religious groups were in addition to already-existing requirements under a 1997 law that mandated registration and administrative procedures which many religious groups found onerous and expensive to comply with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia's 'Yarovaya Law' Imposes Harsh New Restrictions On Religious Groups|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/russia-yarovaya-law-religious-freedom-restrictions/27852531.html|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas J. Reese]], the chair of the [[U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom]], said that "Neither these measures nor the currently existing anti-extremism law meet international human rights and religious freedom standards" and that the Yarovaya Law "will make it easier for Russian authorities to repress religious communities, stifle peaceful dissent, and detain and imprison people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=RUSSIA: USCIRF Condemns Enactment of Anti-Terrorism Laws|url=http://www.uscirf.gov/news-room/press-releases/russia-uscirf-condemns-enactment-anti-terrorism-laws|publisher=United States Commission on International Religious Freedom|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faith McDonnell of the [[Institute on Religion and Democracy]] in Washington, D.C., said: "The law doesn't do that much to defend from terrorism and only prevents Christians and others who are not [Russian] Orthodox from preaching and proselytizing."&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;{{cite web|author=Fred Lucas|title=Back to the Soviet Era’: Putin’s New Law Could Lead to Religious Crackdown|url=http://dailysignal.com/2016/07/20/back-to-the-soviet-era-putins-new-law-could-lead-to-religious-crackdown/|website=The Daily Signal|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|date=July 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. State Department spokeswoman Nicole Thompson wrote that: "We believe that these new amendments will not better protect Russia’s citizens, but are rather part of a troubling Russian trend of intimidation and harassment of civil society and political activists."&lt;ref name="Lucas"/&gt;

The law exempts the government-allied [[Moscow Patriarchate]] of the Russian Orthodox Church from the measures that it applies to all other religious groups. The [[Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church|autonomous Russian Orthodox Church]] opposed the law; Archbishop Andrew Maklakov, administrator of the Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church of America, stated: "As the Russian Federation has drifted back to its Soviet roots more and more over the past 25 years, it has increasingly sought to harass, persecute, and destroy any religious organization that it might consider competition to its own 'state church.'"&lt;ref name="Lucas"/&gt;

===Criticisms of expanded surveillance provisions===
The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], a nonprofit group that aims to defend civil liberties in the digital world, opposed the Yarovaya package, noting that "opposition to the Yarovaya package has come from many quarters. Technical experts have been united in opposing the law. Russia’s government Internet ombudsman opposed the bill. Putin's own human rights head, Mikhail Fedotov, called upon the Senators of Russia’s Federal Council to reject the bill. ISPs have pointed out that compliance would cost them trillions of rubles."&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web|authors=[[Eva Galperin]] &amp; Danny O'Brien|title=Russia Asks For The Impossible With Its New Surveillance Laws|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/russia-asks-impossible-its-new-surveillance-laws|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EFF wrote that because Russia's ISPs, messaging services, and social media platforms  "cannot reasonably comply with all the demands of the Yarovaya package, they become de facto criminals whatever their actions. And that, in turn, gives the Russian state the leverage to extract from them any other concession it desires. The impossibility of full compliance is not a bug—it's an essential feature."&lt;ref name="EFF"/&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] noted the lack of judicial oversight and stated that "these provisions would ultimately jeopardize security, while being ineffective at preventing terrorists from using encryption" as well as "unjustifiably expand surveillance while undermining human rights and cybersecurity."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
