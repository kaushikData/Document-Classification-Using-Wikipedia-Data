'''Abstraction''' in [[mathematics]] is the process of extracting the underlying [[essence]] of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent [[phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]], in ''The Principles of Mathematics'' Volume 1 (pg 219), refers to "the [[principle of abstraction]]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Ash. A Primer of Abstract Mathematics. Cambridge University Press, Jan 1, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary. Edited by Edward Thomas Roe, Le Roy Hooker, Thomas W. Handford. Pg [https://books.google.com/books?id=KhQLAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34 34]&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most highly abstract areas of modern mathematics are [[category theory]] and [[model theory]].

==Description==

Many areas of mathematics began with the study of real world problems, before the underlying rules and concepts were identified and defined as [[abstract structure]]s. For example, geometry has its origins in the calculation of distances and areas in the real world; algebra started with methods of solving problems in [[arithmetic]].

Abstraction is an ongoing process in mathematics and the historical development of many mathematical topics exhibits a progression from the concrete to the abstract. Take the historical development of geometry as an example; the first steps in the abstraction of geometry were made by the ancient Greeks, with [[Euclid's Elements]] being the earliest extant documentation of the axioms of plane geometry—though Proclus tells of an earlier [[Axiomatic system|axiomatisation]] by [[Hippocrates of Chios]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Proclus_history_geometry.html Proclus' Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923114020/http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Proclus_history_geometry.html |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century [[Descartes]] introduced [[Cartesian co-ordinates]] which allowed the development of [[analytic geometry]]. Further steps in abstraction were taken by [[Lobachevsky]], [[Bolyai]], [[Riemann]], and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] who generalised the concepts of geometry to develop [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]]. Later in the 19th century mathematicians generalised geometry even further, developing such areas as geometry in [[N-dimensional space|n dimension]]s, [[projective geometry]], [[affine geometry]] and [[finite geometry]]. Finally [[Felix Klein]]'s "[[Erlangen program]]" identified the underlying theme of all of these geometries, defining each of them as the study of [[Invariant (mathematics)|properties invariant]] under a given group of [[Symmetry|symmetries]]. This level of abstraction revealed connections between geometry and [[abstract algebra]].

The advantages of abstraction are :

* It reveals deep connections between different areas of mathematics.
* Known results in one area can suggest conjectures in a related area.
* Techniques and methods from one area can be applied to prove results in a related area.

One disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts can be difficult to learn.&lt;ref&gt;"... introducing pupils to abstract mathematics is not an easy task and requires a long-term effort that must take into account the variety of the contexts in which mathematics is used", P.L. Ferrari, ''Abstraction in Mathematics'', Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B 29 July 2003 vol. 358 no. 1435 1225-1230&lt;/ref&gt; A degree of [[mathematical maturity]] and experience may be needed for [[Assimilation (psychology)|conceptual assimilation]] of abstractions. One of the underlying principles of the [[Montessori education|Montessori]] approach to mathematics education is encouraging children to move from concrete examples to abstract thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://montessoritraining.blogspot.co.uk/2008/07/montessori-philosophy-moving-from.html Montessori Philosophy: Moving from Concrete to Abstract], North American Montessori Center&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]], in ''The Scientific Outlook'' (1931), writes that "Ordinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what physics really asserts, since the words of everyday life are not sufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say as little as the physicist means to say."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10369">The '''active intellect''' ([[Latin]]: ''intellectus agens''; also translated as '''agent intellect''', '''active intelligence''', '''active reason''', or '''productive intellect''') is a concept in classical and medieval [[philosophy]]. The term refers to the [[Substantial form|formal]] (''morphe'') aspect of the intellect (''[[nous]]''), in accordance with the theory of [[Hylomorphism (Aristotelian)|hylomorphism]]. 

The nature of the active intellect was the subject of intense discussion in medieval philosophy, as various Muslim, Jewish and Christian thinkers sought to reconcile their commitment to Aristotle's account of the body and soul to their own theological commitments. At stake in particular was in what way Aristotle's account of an incorporeal soul might contribute to understanding of the nature of eternal life.

== Aristotle's conception ==
The idea is first encountered in [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] [[On the Soul|''De Anima'']], Book III. Following is the translation of one of those passages (''De Anima'', Bk. III, ch. 5, 430a10-25) by Joe Sachs, with some notes about the Greek:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Joe |last=Sachs |title=Aristotle's On the Soul and On Memory and Recollection|year=2001|publisher=Green Lion Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...since in [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] one thing is the material ([[matter|''hulē'']]) for each kind ''([[genos]])'' (this is what is in potency all the particular things of that kind) but it is something else that is the causal and productive thing by which all of them are formed, as is the case with an art in relation to its material, it is necessary in the soul (''[[psyche (psychology)|psuchē]]'') too that these distinct aspects be present;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;the one sort is intellect (''[[nous]]'') by becoming all things, the other sort by forming all things, in the way an active condition (''[[hexis]]'') like [[light]] too makes the colors that are in potency be at work as colors (''to phōs poiei ta [[dunamis|dunamei]] onta chrōmata [[energeia]]i chrōmata'').&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;blockquote&gt;This sort of intellect [which is like light in the way it makes potential things work as what they are] is separate, as well as being without attributes and unmixed, since it is by its thinghood a [[being-at-work]], for what acts is always distinguished in stature above what is acted upon, as a governing source is above the material it works on.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Knowledge]] (''epistēmē''), in its being-at-work, is the same as the thing it knows, and while knowledge in potency comes first in time in any one knower, in the whole of things it does not take precedence even in time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This does not mean that at one time it thinks but at another time it does not think, but when separated it is just exactly what it is, and this alone is deathless and everlasting (though we have no memory, because this sort of intellect is not acted upon, while the sort that is acted upon is destructible), and without this nothing thinks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The passage tries to explain "how the human intellect passes from its original state, in which it does not think, to a subsequent state, in which it does." He inferred that the energeia/dunamis distinction must also exist in the soul itself.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle says that the [[passive intellect]] receives the [[intelligible form]]s of things, but that the active intellect is required to make the potential knowledge into actual knowledge, in the same way that light makes potential colors into actual colors. 

The passage is often read together with ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book XII, ch.7-10, where Aristotle also discusses the human mind and distinguishes between the active and [[passive intellect|passive]] intellects. In that passage Aristotle appears to equate the active intellect with the "[[unmoved mover]]" and [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D12%3Asection%3D1072b 1072b].&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=May 2017}}

==Interpretations==
Sachs comments that the nature of the active intellect was "the source of a massive amount of commentary and of fierce disagreement"; elsewhere, chapter 5 of ''De Anima'' has been referred to as "the most intensely studied sentences in the history of philosophy".&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt; As Davidson remarks: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Just what Aristotle meant by potential intellect and active intellect - terms not even explicit in the ''De anima'' and at best implied - and just how he understood the interaction between them remains moot. Students of the history of philosophy continue to debate Aristotle's intent, particularly the question whether he considered the active intellect to be an aspect of the human soul or an entity existing independently of man.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Greek'''

The early Greek commentators on Aristotle, in particular [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] and [[Themistius]], gave several different interpretations of the distinction between the active and passive intellects. Some of them regarded the active intellect as a power external to the human mind, Alexander going so far as to identify it with God. 

Later, both these interpretations, [[Neoplatonist]] ones, and perhaps others, influenced the development of an important Arabic language philosophical literature, using the term ''[['aql]]'' as the translation for ''nous''. This literature was later translated into, and commented upon, in Latin and Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Alfarabi, Avicenna, and Averroes, on Intellect|last=Davidson|first=Herbert|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish and Islamic'''

[[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]], and also the Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]], agreed with the "external" interpretation of active intellect, and held that the active intellect was the lowest of the ten emanations descending through the [[celestial spheres]]. Maimonides cited it in his definition of [[prophecy]] where 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Prophecy is, in truth and reality, an emanation sent forth by the [[God|Divine Being]] through the medium of the Active Intellect, in the first instance to man's [[Reason|rational faculty]], and then to his [[Imagination|imaginative faculty]].&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, [[Guide for the Perplexed]] (translator: [[Michael Friedländer]]), Dover: New York, 1904, [http://www.meru.org/Advisors/Sunwall/RambamProphecy.html p. 225]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; The more strictly Aristotelian Muslims (in particular [[Avempace]] and [[Averroes]]) wrote about how one could conjoin oneself with the active intellect, thus attaining philosophical nirvana.  

The reason of the Islamic and Jewish Aristotelians for positing a single external Agent Intellect is that all (rational) human beings are considered by Aristotelians to possess or have access to a fixed and stable set of concepts, a unified correct knowledge of the universe.  The only way that all human minds could possess the same correct knowledge is if they all had access to some central knowledge store, as terminals might have access to a mainframe computer {{Harv|Kraemer|2003}}. This mainframe is the Agent Intellect, the "mind" of the universe, which makes all other cognition possible.

'''Western Christian'''

In medieval and Renaissance Europe some thinkers, such as [[Siger of Brabant]], adopted the interpretation of Averroes on every point, as did the later school of "Paduan Averroists". [[Thomas Aquinas]] elaborated on Aristotle's distinction between the active intellect and passive intellect in his ''Disputed Questions on the Soul'' and his commentary on Aristotle's ''De anima'', arguing, against Averroes, that the active intellect is part of the individual human personality. A third school, of "Alexandrists", rejected the argument linking the active intellect to the [[immortality]] of the soul, while hastening to add that they still believed in immortality as a matter of religious faith. (See [[Pietro Pomponazzi]]; [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]].)

The active intellect, in the sense described, is more properly called the Agent Intellect, as it is the force triggering intellection in the human mind and causing thoughts to pass from the potential to the actual. It must not be confused with the "intellect in act", which is the result of that triggering, and is more akin to the psychological term "active knowledge".  Another term for the final result of intellection, that is to say a person's accumulated knowledge, is the "acquired intellect".

[[Cognitive science|Cognitive]] scientists and psychologists thoroughly investigated agency attribution in humans and non-human animals, since social cognitive mechanisms as [[communication]], [[Social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]], [[imitation]] or [[theory of mind]] presupposes the ability to identify agents and differentiate them from inanimate objects. This ability has also assumed to have a major effect on inferential and predictive processes of the observers of agents, because agentive entities are expected to perform [[Autonomy|autonomous]] behavior based on their current and previous knowledge and intentions, while inanimate objects are supposed to react to external [[Force|physical forces]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Leslie|first=Alan M.|date=1994|volume=|pages=119–148|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511752902.006|isbn=9780511752902|title=Mapping the mind|chapter=ToMM, ToBY, and Agency: Core architecture and domain specificity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is often confused, sensitivity to agency and the sense of agency are different concepts as the sensitivity to agency can be explained as a cognitive ability to identify agentive entities in the environment, while the [[sense of agency]] refers to the sense of control and sometimes to [[self-efficacy]], which is a learnt belief of an individual about his or her own ability to succeed in specific situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|date=1982|title=Self-efficacy mechanism in human agency.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1982-25814-001|journal=American Psychologist|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=122–147|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.37.2.122|issn=0003-066X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical approaches of agency ==
According to Carey and Spelke&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=Carey|first=Susan|title=Domain-specific knowledge and conceptual change|date=1994|work=Mapping the mind|volume=|pages=169–200|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511752902.008|isbn=9780511752902|last2=Spelke|first2=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cognitive models explaining specific [[Perception|perceptual]] and representational abilities, for instance the models of agency recognition, can be separated into two different classes. The ''feature-based models'' of agency assume that the perceptual input of an observer consist of featural and behavioral cues that help to identify agents.

However, neither of these cues are necessary and sufficient to identify an agent&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, since unfamiliar, novel entities like animated figures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Gergely|first2=György|date=2018-06-22|title=Communicative mind-reading in preverbal infants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27804-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=9534|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27804-4|issn=2045-2322|pmc=6015048|pmid=29934630}}&lt;/ref&gt; or robots without human features&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; can elicit agency attribution in humans. Therefore, cognitive models belonging to the ''principle-based approaches''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; were designed to describe how humans perceive agency assuming that the detection of agency is not a precondition, but a consequence of inferential processes about potentially agentive objects.

The theory of teleological stance&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gergely|first=György|last2=Csibra|first2=Gergely|date=2003|title=Teleological reasoning in infancy: the naı̈ve theory of rational action|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364661303001281|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=7|pages=287–292|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00128-1|pmid=12860186|issn=1364-6613|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.331.5767}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that from 12-month of age humans can apply the principle of rational action to determine, whether the observed entity is an agent or an inanimate object expecting that an agent behaves rationally in order to achieve its goal in a given situation. The theory assumes that the rationality principle makes observers able to relate the action, the represented goal-state and the current situational constraints to decide whether an object is an agent. For instance, if infants had learnt that an abstract, unfamiliar agent (an animated circle on a display) approaches another entity by jumping over an obstacle, when the obstacle had been removed, they expected a new, but highly rational behavior from the agent to approach the other entity via a straight pathway. In contrast, when infants were shown that the unfamiliar entity always made a detour when approaching its goal-object exhibiting non-justifiable behavior of jumping in the absence of an obstacle, they did not expect a rational of choice of behavior when the situational constraints changed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

These results and later empirical studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Biro|first=Szilvia|title=The role of behavioral cues in understanding goal-directed actions in infancy|volume=164|date=2007|journal=Progress in Brain Research|pages=303–322|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/s0079-6123(07)64017-5|pmid=17920439|isbn=9780444530165|last2=Csibra|first2=Gergely|last3=Gergely|first3=György}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Csibra|first=Gergely|date=2008|title=Goal attribution to inanimate agents by 6.5-month-old infants|journal=Cognition|volume=107|issue=2|pages=705–717|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2007.08.001|pmid=17869235|issn=0010-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luo|first=Yuyan|date=2010-09-06|title=Three-month-old infants attribute goals to a non-human agent|journal=Developmental Science|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=453–460|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2010.00995.x|issn=1363-755X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Laura|last2=Carey|first2=Susan|date=2005-01-01|title=12-Month-Old Infants Represent Probable Endings of Motion Events|journal=Infancy|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=73–83|doi=10.1207/s15327078in0701_6|issn=1525-0008|citeseerx=10.1.1.140.2588}}&lt;/ref&gt; underpinned that agency recognition in humans can be explained by principle-based models rather than simple perceptual cues. As Gergely and Csibra concluded&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; from 12-month of age humans “can take the teleological stance to interpret actions as means to goals, can evaluate the relative efficiency of means by applying the principle of rational action, and can generate systematic inferences to identify relevant aspects of the situation to justify the action as an efficient means even when these aspects are not directly visible to them".

== Types of agents ==
It was proposed&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|last=Gergely|first=György|date=2010-07-15|pages=76–105|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|language=en|doi=10.1002/9781444325485.ch3|isbn=9781444325485|title=The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Childhood Cognitive Development|chapter=Kinds of Agents: The Origins of Understanding Instrumental and Communicative Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the concept of agency involves different kinds of agents represented by independent cognitive systems in humans and perhaps in non-human species as well.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Csík|first2=Andor|last3=Lovas|first3=Kata|last4=Gergely|first4=György|last5=Topál|first5=József|date=2017|title=The attribution of navigational- and goal-directed agency in dogs (Canis familiaris) and human toddlers (Homo sapiens).|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=131|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1037/com0000053|pmid=28182482|issn=1939-2087|url=http://real.mtak.hu/79227/1/2017_Tauzin_etal_JoCP_accepted_manuscript_u.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, the species-specific social environment allows to identify agents either based on non-communicative observation of their rational, goal-directed actions or by relying on their communicative behavior which they exchange with other agents. In non-human species, however, none of these types of input information are necessary, since unfamiliar agents can be recognized simply on the basis of their perceptual abilities, which has context-dependent effect on their behavior even in the absence a visible goal-object that may be required to assess the efficiency of goal-approach.

=== Instrumental agency ===
According to Gergely&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; instrumental agents are intentional agents that exhibit actions in order to realize their goal states in the environment. The recognition of instrumental agents is investigated by numerous experiments in human infants&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Biro|first=Szilvia|title=The role of behavioral cues in understanding goal-directed actions in infancy|volume=164|date=2007|journal=Progress in Brain Research|pages=303–322|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/s0079-6123(07)64017-5|pmid=17920439|isbn=9780444530165|last2=Csibra|first2=Gergely|last3=Gergely|first3=György}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Csibra|first=Gergely|last2=Bíró|first2=Szilvia|last3=Koós|first3=Orsolya|last4=Gergely|first4=György|date=2003|title=One-year-old infants use teleological representations of actions productively|journal=Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=111–133|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2701_4|issn=0364-0213}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and also in non-human apes.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rochat|first=Magali J.|last2=Serra|first2=Elisabetta|last3=Fadiga|first3=Luciano|last4=Gallese|first4=Vittorio|date=2008|title=The Evolution of Social Cognition: Goal Familiarity Shapes Monkeys' Action Understanding|journal=Current Biology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=227–232|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.12.021|pmid=18221878|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uller|first=Claudia|date=2003-12-18|title=Disposition to recognize goals in infant chimpanzees|journal=Animal Cognition|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=154–61|doi=10.1007/s10071-003-0204-9|pmid=14685823|issn=1435-9448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wood|first=Justin N.|last2=Glynn|first2=David D.|last3=Phillips|first3=Brenda C.|last4=Hauser|first4=Marc D.|date=2007-09-07|title=The Perception of Rational, Goal-Directed Action in Nonhuman Primates|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/317/5843/1402|journal=Science|language=en|volume=317|issue=5843|pages=1402–1405|doi=10.1126/science.1144663|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17823353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Communicative agency ===
In contrast to instrumental agents, communicative agents&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gergely|first=György|title=Reasoning about Instrumental and Communicative Agency in Human Infancy|date=2012|work=Rational Constructivism in Cognitive Development|pages=59–94|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-397919-3.00003-4|isbn=9780123979193|last2=Jacob|first2=Pierre|url=https://jeannicod.ccsd.cnrs.fr/ijn_00756294/file/Gergely_Jacob_2012_in_Rational_Constructivism.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; are intentional agents whose actions are performed to bring about a specific change in the mental representations of the addressee, for instance by providing new and relevant information. The recognition of communicative agency may allow for the observer to predict that communicative information transfer can have a relevant effect on the behavior of the agent, even if the interacting agents and their communicative signals are unfamiliar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Gergely|first2=György|date=2018-06-22|title=Communicative mind-reading in preverbal infants|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27804-4|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=9534|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27804-4|issn=2045-2322|pmc=6015048|pmid=29934630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Navigational agency ===
The [[Construals|construal]] of navigational agency is based on the assumption that Leslie’s theory&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; on agency implies two different types of distal sensitivity; distal sensitivity in space and distal sensitivity in time. While goal-directed instrumental agents need both of these abilities to represent a goal-state in the future and achieve it in a rational and efficient manner, navigational agents are supposed to have only perceptual abilities, that is a distal sensitivity in space to avoid collision with objects in their environments. A study&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; contrasting the ability of dogs and human infants to attribute agency to unfamiliar self-propelled object showed that dogs – unlike human infants – may lack the capability to recognize instrumental agents, however they can identify navigational agents.

== Agency recognition in non-human animals ==
The ability to represent the efficiency of goal-directed actions of an instrumental agent may be a phylogenetically ancient core cognitive mechanism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The origin of concepts|last=Susan.|first=Carey|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195367638|location=Oxford|oclc=233697385}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be found in non-human primates as well. Previous research provided evidence for this assumption showing that this sensitivity affects the expectations of cotton-top tamarins, rhesus macaques, and chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Non-human apes are able to make inferences about the goal of an instrumental agent by taking the environmental constraints that can guide the agents’ actions into account. Moreover, it seems that non-human species like dogs can recognize contingent reactivity as an abstract of cue of agency, and respond to contingent agent significantly different in contrast to inanimate objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Kovács|first2=Krisztina|last3=Topál|first3=József|date=2016-07-19|title=Dogs Identify Agents in Third-Party Interactions on the Basis of the Observed Degree of Contingency|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=27|issue=8|pages=1061–1068|doi=10.1177/0956797616647518|pmid=27268590|issn=0956-7976|url=http://real.mtak.hu/79227/1/2017_Tauzin_etal_JoCP_accepted_manuscript_u.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gergely|first=Anna|last2=Petró|first2=Eszter|last3=Topál|first3=József|last4=Miklósi|first4=Ádám|date=2013-08-28|title=What Are You or Who Are You?

'''Anātman''' in [[Sanskrit]] means that "which is different from atman" or "non-self".&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams, Monier-Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Article on Anatman, '''Quote:''' anAtman m. non-self, another; something different from spirit or soul&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism, the former definition is found in some texts, while in [[Buddhism]], [[anatta|anātman or anattā]] means non-self.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013), Quote: "Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman (“the self”)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advaita concept of Anātman==
According to [[Chandrashekhara Bharati III|Śrī Candraśekhara Bhāratī of Śringeri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri [[Chandrashekhara Bharati III]] of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=207|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncQYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;dq=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cSjAUOuVM4vprQe-moHoCw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shankara does not use the term anātman to mean non-soul or anti-soul. The Atman is formless and partless whose true nature cannot be perceived, while the anātman has form, has parts and whose nature can be perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vivekachudamani of Adi Shankara|author=Swami Madhavananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|place=Kolkata|quote= Verse 148|pages=56|url=https://archive.org/details/vivekachudamanio00sankrich }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anātman, a creation of Brahman which is non-different from Brahman and has no existence apart from Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vivekachudamani of Adi Shankara|author=Swami Madhavananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|place=Kolkata|quote= Verse 20|pages=12|url=https://archive.org/details/vivekachudamanio00sankrich }}&lt;/ref&gt; To comprehend the difference between ātman and anātman is to become liberated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vivekachudamani of Adi Shankara|author=Swami Madhavananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|place=Kolkata|quote= Verse 152|pages=58|url=https://archive.org/details/vivekachudamanio00sankrich }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to realise the self-existent eternal Atman, the seeker after Truth uses "Neti, neti", that is "not this, not this" on Anatman, to reach that which remains as Atman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri [[Chandrashekhara Bharati III]] of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|pages=270–272, 342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncQYAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist concept of Anatman or Anatta==
Buddhists believe that there is no permanent underlying substance called self or soul (Atman) in human beings.&lt;ref name=4sourcesbr&gt;[a] KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, {{ISBN|978-8120806191}}, pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards;&lt;br&gt;[b] Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791422175}}, page 64; "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.";&lt;br&gt;[c] Edward Roer (Translator), {{Google books|3uwDAAAAMAAJ|Shankara's Introduction|page=2}} to ''Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad'', pages 2-4;&lt;br&gt;[d] Katie Javanaud (2013), [https://philosophynow.org/issues/97/Is_The_Buddhist_No-Self_Doctrine_Compatible_With_Pursuing_Nirvana Is The Buddhist ‘No-Self’ Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?], Philosophy Now&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnplott3&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, page 63, Quote: "The Buddhist schools reject any Ātman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013), Quote: "Anatta in Buddhism, the doctrine that there is in humans no permanent, underlying soul. The concept of anatta, or anatman, is a departure from the Hindu belief in atman (“the self”)."&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that anattā/anātman (non-self), [[impermanence]] and [[dukkha]] (suffering) are the three characteristics (trilakkhana) of all existence, and understanding of these three constitutes right understanding. "The ''anātman'' doctrine was in no sense an addendum, since it was fundamental to the other two doctrines; that is, because there is no real human self, there is no duration in human experience; and because there is no duration in human experience, there is no genuine happiness."{{sfn|Organ|1987|p=163}}

Nāgārjuna's explication of the theory of anātman as śūnyatā (emptiness) in the ''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā'' was part of his restatement of the Buddha's [[Four Noble Truths]] as well as a rejection of the philosophies of the [[early Buddhist schools]] of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvastivadins]] and the [[Sautrāntika]].{{sfn|Kalupahana|1996|p=67}}

In the period from 1885 to 1908, many well-documented atrocities were perpetrated in the [[Congo Free State]] (today the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) which, at the time, was a [[colonialism|colony]] under the personal rule of [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II of Belgium]]. These atrocities were sometimes collectively referred to by European contemporaries as the "Congo Horrors", and were particularly associated with the labour policies used to collect [[natural rubber]] for export. Together with epidemic disease, famine, and a falling birth rate caused by these disruptions, the atrocities contributed to a sharp decline in the Congolese population. The magnitude of the population fall over the period is disputed, but it is thought to be between one and 15 million people.

At the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–85, the European powers allocated the [[Congo Basin]] region to a private charitable organisation run by Leopold II, who had long held ambitions for colonial expansion. The territory under Leopold's control exceeded {{convert|1,000,000|mi2|km2|sigfig=2|abbr=on|order=flip}} and, amid financial problems, was ruled by a tiny cadre of white administrators drawn from across Europe. Initially, the colony proved unprofitable and insufficient, with the state always close to bankruptcy. The boom in demand for [[natural rubber]], which was abundant in the territory, created a radical shift in the 1890s—to facilitate the extraction and export of rubber, all "uninhabited" land in the Congo was nationalised, with the majority distributed to private companies as [[Concession (contract)|concessions]]. Some was kept by the state. Between 1891 and 1906, the companies were allowed to do whatever they wished with almost no judicial interference, the result being that [[forced labour]] and violent coercion were used to collect the rubber cheaply and maximise profit. A native paramilitary army, the ''[[Force Publique]]'', was also created to enforce the labour policies. Individual workers who refused to participate in rubber collection could be killed and entire villages razed. Individual white administrators were also free to indulge their own sadism.

Despite these atrocities, the main cause of the population decline was disease. A number of pandemics, notably [[African trypanosomiasis|African sleeping sickness]], [[smallpox]], [[swine influenza]], and [[amoebic dysentery]], ravaged indigenous populations. In 1901 alone it was estimated that 500,000 Congolese had died from sleeping sickness. Disease, famine and violence combined to reduce the birth-rate while [[excess death]]s rose.

The severing of workers' hands achieved particular international notoriety. These were sometimes cut off by ''Force Publique'' soldiers who were made to account for every shot they fired by bringing back the hands of their victims. These details were recorded by [[Christian mission|Christian missionaries]] working in the Congo and caused public outrage when they were made known to the public in the United Kingdom, Belgium, the United States and elsewhere. An international campaign against the Congo Free State began in 1890 and reached its apogee after 1900 under the leadership of the British activist [[E. D. Morel]]. In 1908, as a result of international pressure, the Belgian government annexed the Congo Free State to form the [[Belgian Congo]], and ended many of the systems responsible for the abuses. The size of the population decline during the period is the subject of extensive [[historiography|historiographical]] debate, and there is an open debate as to whether the atrocities constitute genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanley|first1=Tim|title=Belgium's Heart of Darkness|url=http://www.historytoday.com/tim-stanley/belgiums-heart-darkness|website=History Today|accessdate=6 March 2017|ref=Stanley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ankomah|first1=Baffour|title=The Butcher of Congo|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/35/181.html|website=AfricaAsia.com|accessdate=6 March 2017|ref=Anomakah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the Belgian monarchy nor the Belgian state have ever apologized for the atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/an-unsettling-visit-to-kongo|title=A Belgian Visit to “Kongo”|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Kongovrijstaat.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of the [[Congo Free State]] in 1892]]
Even before his accession to the throne of [[Belgium]] in 1865, the future king [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand and enhance Belgian prestige.{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=12–5}} Politically, however, colonisation was unpopular in Belgium as it was perceived as a risky and expensive gamble with no obvious benefit to the country and his many attempts to persuade politicians met with little success.{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=12–5}}

Determined to look for a colony for himself and inspired by recent reports from central Africa, Leopold began patronising a number of leading explorers, including [[Henry Morton Stanley]].{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=12–5}} Leopold established the [[International African Association]] (''Association internationale africaine''), a "charitable" organisation to oversee the exploration and surveying of a territory based around the [[Congo River]], with the stated goal of bringing humanitarian assistance and civilisation to the natives. In the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–85, European leaders officially recognised Leopold's control over the {{convert|2,350,000|km2|abbr=on}} of the notionally-independent [[Congo Free State]] on the grounds that it would be a [[free trade]] area and [[buffer state]] between British and French spheres of influence.{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=253–5}} In the Free State, Leopold exercised total personal control without much delegation to subordinates.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=171}} African chiefs played an important role in the administration by implementing government orders within their communities.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=172}} Throughout much of its existence, however, Free State presence in the territory that it claimed was patchy, with its few officials concentrated in a number of small and widely dispersed "stations" which controlled only small amounts of hinterland.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=275}} In 1900, there were just 3,000 white people in the Congo, of whom only half were Belgian.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=63}} The colony was perpetually short of administrative staff and officials, who numbered between 700 and 1,500 during the period.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=173}}

In the early years of the colony, much of the administration's attention was focused on consolidating its control by fighting the African peoples on the colony's periphery who resisted colonial rule. These included the tribes around the [[Kwango river]], in the south-west, and the [[Uele River|Uélé]] in the north-east.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=60}} Some of the violence of the period can be attributed to African groups using colonial support to settle scores or white administrators acting without state approval.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=91}}

===Economic and administrative situation===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="Ultimately the state's policy towards its African subjects became dominated by the demands which were made—both by the state itself and by the concessionary companies—for labour for the collection of wild produce of the territory. The system itself engendered abuses&amp;nbsp;..."|2=Ruth Slade (1962){{sfn|Slade|1962|p=178}}}}

The Free State was intended, above all, to be profitable for its investors and Leopold in particular.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=274}} Its finances were frequently precarious. Early reliance on [[ivory]] exports did not make as much money as hoped and the colonial administration was frequently in debt, nearly defaulting on a number of occasions.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=272}} A boom in demand for [[natural rubber]] in the 1890s, however, ended these problems as the colonial state was able to force Congolese males to work as forced labour collecting wild rubber which could then be exported to Europe and North America.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=272}} The rubber boom transformed what had been an unexceptional colonial system before 1890 and led to significant profits.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|pp=78–9}} Exports rose from 580 to 3,740 tons between 1895 and 1900.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=37}}

In order to facilitate economic extraction from the colony, land was divided up under the so-called Domain System (''régime domanial'') in 1891.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=265}}{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=177}} All vacant land, including forests and areas not under cultivation, was decreed to be "[[Terra nullius|uninhabited]]" and thus the possession of the state, leaving many of the Congo's resources (especially rubber and ivory) under direct colonial ownership.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=265}}{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=79}} [[Concession (territory)|Concessions]] were allocated to private companies. In the north, the ''[[Société Anversoise]]'' was given {{convert|160,000|km2|abbr=on}}, while the [[Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company]] (ABIR) was given a comparable territory in the south.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=87}} The ''[[Compagnie du Katanga]]'' and ''[[Compagnie des Grands Lacs]]'' were given smaller concessions in the south and east respectively. Leopold kept a large proportion of territory under personal rule, known as the Crown Domain (''Domaine de la Couronne''), of {{convert|250,000|km2|abbr=on}} which was added to the territory he already controlled under the Private Domain (''Domaine privé'').{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=87}}{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=37}} "The major economic exploitation of the Congolese interior, therefore, lay in the hands of the king and a few privileged concessionaries."{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=87}} The system was extremely profitable and ABIR made a turnover of over 100 per cent on its initial stake in a single year.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=38}} The King made 70 million [[Belgian franc]]s' profit from the system between 1896 and 1905.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=177}} The Free State's concession system was soon copied by other colonial regimes, notably those in the neighbouring [[French Congo]].{{sfn|Vangroenweghe|2006|pp=323–6}}

==Atrocities==

===Red Rubber system and forced labour===
[[File:StoryoftheCongoFreeState 280.jpg|thumb|upright|Congolese labourers tapping [[Cryptostegia grandiflora|rubber vines]] near [[Lusambo]] in [[Kasai region|Kasai]]]]
With the majority of the Free State's revenues derived from the export of rubber, a labour policy (known by critics as the "Red Rubber system") was created to maximise its extraction. Labour was demanded by the administration as taxation.{{efn|Demanding taxation in the form of forced labour was common across colonial Africa at the time.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|pp=267–8}}}} This created a "slave society" as companies became increasingly dependent on forcibly mobilising Congolese labour for their collection of rubber.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=28}} The state recruited a number of black officials, known as ''capitas'', to organise local labour.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=28}} However, the desire to maximise rubber collection, and hence the state's profits, meant that the centrally-enforced demands were often set arbitrarily without considering the numbers or the welfare of workers.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|pp=267–8}} In the concessionary territories, the private companies which had purchased a concession from the Free State administration were able to use virtually any measures they wished to increase production and profits without state interference.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=272}} The lack of a developed bureaucracy to oversee any commercial methods produced an atmosphere of "informality" throughout the state in regards to the operation of enterprises, which in turn facilitated abuses.{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=51}} Treatment of labourers (especially the duration of service) was not regulated by law and instead was left to the discretion of officials on the ground.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|pp=267–8}} [[Abir Congo Company|ABIR]] and the ''Anversoise'' were particularly noted for the harshness with which officials treated Congolese workers. The historian [[Jean Stengers]] described regions controlled by these two companies as "veritable hells-on-earth".{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=270}}

[[File:Vauthier Rene Le Congo Belge 159 Les sentinelles de la Princesse Clementine.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Force Publique]]'' soldiers photographed in 1900]]
Workers who refused to supply their labour were coerced with "constraint and repression". Dissenters were beaten or whipped with the ''[[chicotte]]'', hostages were taken to ensure prompt collection and punitive expeditions were sent to destroy villages which refused.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|pp=267–8}} The policy led to a collapse of Congolese economic and cultural life, as well as farming in some areas.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=94}} Much of the enforcement of rubber production was the responsibility of the ''[[Force Publique]]'', the colonial military. The ''Force'' had originally been established in 1885, with white officers and NCOs and black soldiers, and recruited from as far afield as [[Zanzibar]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Liberia]].{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|pp=76–7}} In the Congo, it recruited from specific ethnic and social demographics.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=173}} These included the [[Ngala people|Bangala]], and this contributed to the spread of the [[Lingala]] language across the country, and freed slaves from the eastern Congo.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|pp=76–7}} The so-called [[Zappo Zap|Zappo-Zaps]] (from the [[Songye people|Songye ethnic group]]) were the most feared. Reportedly cannibals, the Zappo-Zaps frequently abused their official positions to raid the countryside for slaves.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=181}} By 1900, the ''Force Publique'' numbered 19,000 men.{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=123}}

The red rubber system emerged with the creation of the concession regime in 1891{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=22}} and lasted until 1906 when the concession system was restricted.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=270}} At its height, it was heavily localised in the [[Équateur (former province)|Équateur]], [[Bandundu Province|Bandundu]], and [[Kasai region|Kasai]] regions.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=96}}

===Mutilation and brutality===
[[File:Victim of Congo atrocities, Congo, ca. 1890-1910 (IMP-CSCNWW33-OS10-19).jpg|thumb|A missionary points to the severed hand of a Congolese villager. Severed hands were "the most potent symbol of colonial brutality" in the Congo.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=30}}]]

Failure to meet the rubber collection quotas was punishable by death. Meanwhile, the Force Publique were required to provide the hand of their victims as proof when they had shot and killed someone, as it was believed that they would otherwise use the munitions (imported from Europe at considerable cost) for hunting. As a consequence, the rubber quotas were in part paid off in chopped-off hands. Sometimes the hands were collected by the soldiers of the Force Publique, sometimes by the villages themselves. There were even small wars where villages attacked neighboring villages to gather hands, since their rubber quotas were too unrealistic to fill. A Catholic priest quotes a man, Tswambe, speaking of the hated state official Léon Fiévez, who ran a district along the river {{convert|300|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} north of [[Pool Malebo|Stanley Pool]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All blacks saw this man as the devil of the [[Equator]] ... From all the bodies killed in the field, you had to cut off the hands. He wanted to see the number of hands cut off by each soldier, who had to bring them in baskets ... A village which refused to provide rubber would be completely swept clean. As a young man, I saw [Fiévez's] soldier Molili, then guarding the village of Boyeka, take a net, put ten arrested natives in it, attach big stones to the net, and make it tumble into the river ... Rubber causes these torments; that's why we no longer want to hear its name spoken. Soldiers made young men kill or [[rape]] their own mothers and sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, ''King Leopold's Ghost'', p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One junior officer described a raid to punish a village that had protested. The officer in command "ordered us to cut off the heads of the men and hang them on the village palisades ... and to hang the women and the children on the palisade in the form of a cross".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourne |first=Henry Richard Fox |title=Civilisation in Congoland: A Story of International Wrong-doing |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jWccAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Civilisation+in+Congoland%22#PPR3,M1 |accessdate=2007-09-26 |year=1903 |publisher=P. S. King &amp; Son |location=London |pages=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing a Congolese person killed for the first time, a Danish missionary wrote, "The soldier said 'Don't take this to heart so much. They kill us if we don't bring the rubber. The Commissioner has promised us if we have plenty of hands he will shorten our service.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbath |first=Peter |title=The River Congo: The Discovery, Exploration and Exploitation of the World's Most Dramatic Rivers |year=1977 |publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]] |location= |isbn=0-06-122490-1 |pages=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Forbath's words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The baskets of severed hands, set down at the feet of the European post commanders, became the symbol of the Congo Free State. ... The collection of hands became an end in itself. ''Force Publique'' soldiers brought them to the stations in place of rubber; they even went out to harvest them instead of rubber ... They became a sort of currency. They came to be used to make up for shortfalls in rubber quotas, to replace ... the people who were demanded for the forced labour gangs; and the ''Force Publique'' soldiers were paid their bonuses on the basis of how many hands they collected.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In theory, each right hand proved a killing. In practice, to save ammunition soldiers sometimes "cheated" by simply cutting off the hand and leaving the victim to live or die. More than a few survivors later said that they had lived through a massacre by acting dead, not moving even when their hands were severed, and waiting till the soldiers left before seeking help. In some instances a soldier could shorten his service term by bringing more hands than the other soldiers, which led to widespread mutilations and dismemberment. Other practices used to force workers to collect rubber were taking women and family members hostage.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=31}}

Aside from rubber collection, violence in the Free State chiefly occurred in connection with wars and rebellions. Native states, notably [[Msiri]]'s [[Yeke Kingdom]], the [[Zande Federation]], and Swahili-speaking territory in the eastern Congo under [[Tippu Tip]], refused to recognise colonial authority and were defeated by the ''Force Publique'' with great brutality, during the [[Congo Arab war]].{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=33}} In 1895, [[Batetela Rebellion|a military mutiny]] broke out among the Batetela in Kasai, leading to a 4-year insurgency. The conflict was particularly brutal and caused a great number of casualties.{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=82}}

Leopold II was reported to have disapproved of the dismemberments, not on human rights grounds but because it harmed his economic interests. He was quoted as saying "Cut off hands - that's idiotic. I'd cut off all the rest of them, but not hands. That's the one thing I need in the Congo."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/may/13/features11.g22|title=The hidden holocaust|date=1999-05-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population decline==

===Causes===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote="I suggest that it is impossible to separate deaths caused by massacre and starvation from those due to the pandemic of sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) which decimated central Africa at the time."|2=[[Neal Ascherson]] (1999){{sfn|Ascherson|1999|p=9}}}}

Historians generally agree that a dramatic reduction in the overall size of the Congolese population occurred during the two decades of Free State rule in the Congo.{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=46}} It is argued that the reduction in the Congo was atypical and can be attributed to the direct and indirect effects of colonial rule and especially to disease and falling birthrate.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=37}}

The historian [[Adam Hochschild]] argued that the dramatic fall in the Free State population was the result of a combination of "murder", "starvation, exhaustion and exposure", "disease" and "a plummeting birth rate".{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=226}} [[Roger Casement]], concurs with this view.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. pp. 226–232.&lt;/ref&gt; [[African trypanosomiasis|Sleeping sickness]] was also a major cause of fatality at the time. Opponents of Leopold's rule stated, however, that the administration itself was to be considered responsible for the spreading of the epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. pp. 230–231.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is impossible to be sure in the absence of records, violence and murder represented only a portion of the total. In a local study of the [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] and [[Kete people]]s, the historian [[Jan Vansina]] estimated that violence accounted for the deaths of less than five percent of the population.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=136}}

[[File:Trypanosoma sp. PHIL 613 lores.jpg|thumb|left|[[African trypanosomiasis]], estimated to have killed more than 500,000 Congolese in 1901 alone]]
Diseases imported by Arab traders, European colonists and African porters ravaged the Congolese population and "greatly exceeded" the numbers killed by violence.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=137}} [[Smallpox]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[amoebic dysentery]], venereal diseases (especially [[syphilis]] and [[gonorrhea]]), and [[swine influenza]] were particularly severe.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=138}} Sleeping sickness, in particular, was "epidemic in large areas" of the Congo and had a high mortality rate.{{sfn|Lyons|1992|p=7}} In 1901 alone, it is estimated that as many as 500,000 Congolese died from sleeping sickness.{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=231}} Vansina estimated that five percent of the Congolese population perished from swine influenza.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|pp=143–4}} In areas in which dysentery became endemic, between 30 and 60 percent of the population could die.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=143}} Vansina also pointed to the effects of malnutrition and food shortages in reducing immunity to the new diseases.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=136}} The disruption of African rural populations may have helped to spread diseases further.{{sfn|Ascherson|1999|p=9}} Nevertheless, historian Roger Anstey wrote that "a strong strand of local, oral tradition holds the rubber policy to have been a greater cause of death and depopulation than either the scourge of sleeping sickness or the periodic ravages of smallpox."{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=46}}

It is also widely believed that birth rates fell during the period too, meaning that the growth rate of the population fell relative to the [[natural death]] rate. Vansina, however, notes that precolonial societies had high birth and death rates, leading to a great deal of natural population fluctuation over time.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=146}} Among the Kuba, the period 1880 to 1900 was actually one of population expansion.{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=137}}

===Estimates===
A reduction of the population of the Congo is noted by all who have compared the country at the beginning of Leopold's control with the beginning of Belgian state rule in 1908, but estimates of the death toll vary considerably. Estimates of some contemporary observers suggest that the population decreased by half during this period. According to [[E. D. Morel|Edmund D. Morel]], the Congo Free State counted "20 million souls".&lt;ref&gt;Morel, E. D. (1904) ''King Leopold's Rule in Africa''. London: William Heinnemann, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, [[Mark Twain]] mentioned the number of ten million deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Twain, M. (1905) ''King Leopold’s soliloquy a defense of his Congo rule''. Boston: P. R. Warren Co., p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates of the size of the overall population decline (or [[mortality displacement]]) range between two and 13 million.{{efn|The first census taken in the Congo was in 1924, so it is impossible to be sure of the size of the population at either the beginning or the end of the Free State period.{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=233}}{{sfn|Vansina|2010|p=128}}}} Ascherson cites an estimate by Casement of a population fall of three million, although he notes that it is "almost certainly an underestimate".{{sfn|Ascherson|1999|pp=9, 251}}

In the absence of a [[census]] providing even an initial idea of the size of population of the region at the inception of the Congo Free State (the first was taken in 1924),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shelton |first=D. |title=Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity |year=2005 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] |location=[[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] |isbn=0-02-865849-3 |pages=621}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is impossible to quantify population changes in the period. Despite this, Forbath more recently claimed the loss was at least five million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Forbath |first=P. |title=The River Congo: The Discovery, Exploration, and Exploitation of the World's Most Dramatic River, 1991 (Paperback) |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0-06-122490-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Hochschild]] and [[Jan Vansina]] use the number 10 million. Hochschild cites several recent independent lines of investigation, by anthropologist Jan Vansina and others, that examine local sources (police records, religious records, oral traditions, genealogies, personal diaries), which generally agree with the assessment of the 1919 Belgian government commission: roughly half the population perished during the Free State period. Since the first official census by the Belgian authorities in 1924 put the population at about 10 million, these various approaches suggest a rough estimate of a total of 10 million dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. |last=Hochschild |authorlink=Adam Hochschild |title=King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-74329-160-3 |pages=225–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Vansina returned to the issue of quantifying the total population decline, and revised his earlier position, he concluded that the Kuba population (one of the many Congolese populations) was rising during the first two decades of Leopold II's rule, and declined with 25 percent from 1900 to 1919, mainly due to sickness.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Vansina is an anthropologist that made quantitative estimates based on qualitative research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vansina, Jan (2010).

Louis and Stengers state that population figures at the start of Leopold's control are only "wild guesses", while calling E. D.

Morel's History of the Congo Reform Movement.'' Oxford: Clarendon, pp. 252–257.&lt;/ref&gt; However, authors that point out the lack of reliable demographic data are questioned by others calling the former minimalists and agnosticists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Roes |first1= A |year= 2010 |title= Towards a History of Mass Violence in the Etat Indépendant du Congo, 1885–1908 |url= |journal= South African Historical Journal |volume= 62 |issue= 4 |page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; proving that these questions remain the object of heated debate.

Since the first census of the Congolese population was made in 1924,{{efn|The accuracy of the 1924 census has itself been criticised.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=24}} }} there is a consensus among historians that accurate predictions of the population fall or number of deaths is impossible.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=24}}

==Investigation and international awareness==
[[File:Punch congo rubber cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1906 cartoon from the British satirical magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' showing a Congolese worker, entangled by a rubber snake with the head of Leopold II ]]

Eventually, growing scrutiny of Leopold's regime led to [[Congo Free State propaganda war|a popular campaign movement]], centered in the United Kingdom and the United States, to force Leopold to renounce his ownership of the Congo. In many cases, the campaigns based their information on reports from British and Swedish missionaries working in the Congo.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=179}}

The first international protest occurred in 1890 when [[George Washington Williams]], an American, published an open letter to Leopold about abuses he had witnessed.{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=36}} Public interest in the abuses in the Congo Free State grew sharply from 1895, when the [[Stokes Affair]] and reports of mutilations reached the European and American public which began to discuss the "Congo Question".{{sfn|Slade|1962|pp=178–9}} To appease public opinion, Leopold instigated a Commission for the Protection of Natives (''Commission pour la Protection des Indigènes''), composed of foreign missionaries, but made few serious efforts at substantive reform.{{sfn|Slade|1962|p=180}}

In Britain, the campaign was led by the activist and pamphleteer [[E. D. Morel]] after 1900, whose book ''[[Red Rubber]]'' (1906) reached a mass audience. Notable members of the campaign included the novelists [[Mark Twain]], Joseph Conrad and [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] as well as Belgian socialists such as [[Emile Vandervelde]].{{sfn|Renton|Seddon|Zeilig|2007|p=39}} Campaigning groups, especially the [[Congo Reform Association]], inspired by its founder's [[Casement Report]], did not oppose colonialism and instead sought to end the excesses of the Free State by encouraging Belgium to annex the colony officially. This would avoid damaging the delicate balance of power between France and Britain on the continent. While supporters of the Free State regime attempted to argue against claims of atrocities, a Commission of Enquiry, appointed by the regime in 1904, confirmed the stories of atrocities and pressure on the Belgian government increased.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=26}}

In 1908, as a direct result of this campaign, Belgium formally annexed the territory, creating the [[Belgian Congo]].{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=657; 663}} Conditions for the indigenous population improved dramatically with the suppression of forced labour, although many officials who had formerly worked for the Free State were retained in their posts long after annexation.{{sfn|Stengers|1969|p=271}} Instead of mandating labour for colonial enterprises directly, the Belgian administration used a coercive tax that deliberately pressured Congolese to find work with European employers to procure the necessary funds to make the payments. For some time after the end of the Free State the Congolese were also required to provide a certain number of days of service per year for infrastructure projects. In spite of these measures, the legacy of the population decline of Leopold's reign left the colonial government with a severe labour shortage and it often had to resort to mass migrations to provide workers to emerging businesses.{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=52}}

==Historiography and the term "genocide"==
The significant number of deaths under the Free State regime has led to some scholars to relate the atrocities to later genocides, though understanding of the losses under the colonial administration's rule as the result of harsh economic exploitation has led others to dispute the comparison.{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=87}} According to the [[United Nations]]' 1948 definition of the term "genocide", a genocide must be "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group".{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=255}} Sociologist [[Rhoda Howard-Hassmann]] stated that because the Congolese were not killed in a systematic fashion according to this criterion, "technically speaking, this was not genocide even in a legally retroactive sense."{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=88}} Historians Hochschild and [[Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja]] have rejected allegations of genocide in the Free State because there is no evidence of a policy of deliberate extermination or the desire to eliminate any specific population groups,{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|p=255}}{{sfn|Nzongola-Ntalaja|2007|p=22}} though the latter added that nevertheless there was "a death toll of [[Holocaust]] proportions."{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=88}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote="...&amp;nbsp;no reputable historian of the Congo has made charges of genocide; a forced labor system, although it may be equally deadly, is different."|source=Historian [[Adam Hochschild]] (2005){{sfn|New York Review of Books|2005}}}}

It is generally agreed by historians that extermination was never the policy of the Free State, which benefitted from the labour provided by Congolese workers. The Free State even made some efforts to attempt to tackle the spread of infectious diseases in the Congo by seeking the support of foreign medical institutes such as the [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]].{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=95}}{{sfn|Lyons|1992|p=74}} According to historian [[David Van Reybrouck]], "It would be absurd&amp;nbsp;... to speak of an act of 'genocide' or a 'holocaust'; genocide implies the conscious, planned annihilation of a specific population, and that was never the intention here, or the result&amp;nbsp;... But it was definitely a [[hecatomb]], a slaughter on a staggering scale that was not intentional, but could have been recognised much earlier as the collateral damage of a perfidious, rapacious policy of exploitation".{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=95}} According to Hochschild, "while not a case of genocide, in the strict sense", the atrocities in the Congo were "one of the most appalling slaughters known to have been brought about by human agency".{{sfn|Ascherson|1999|pp=8–9}}{{efn|Hochschild did label the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide|German extermination of the Herero in South-West Africa]] (1904–1907) as a genocide because of its defined, systematic and intentional nature.{{sfn|Hochschild|1999|pp=281–2}}}}

[[File:Hands of Lingomo and Bolengo.tif|thumb|Picture of "Congolese men holding cut off hands" captured by [[Alice Seeley Harris]] in [[Baringa, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Baringa]], May 1904]]
Historians have argued that comparisons drawn in the press by some between the death toll of the Free State atrocities and the Holocaust during [[World War II]] have been responsible for creating undue confusion over the issue of terminology.{{sfn|New York Review of Books|2006}}{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=24}} In one incident, the Japanese newspaper ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'' used the word "genocide" in the title of a 2005 article by Hochschild. Hochschild himself criticised the title as "misleading" and stated that it had been chosen "without my knowledge". Similar criticism was echoed by other historians, including [[Jean-Luc Vellut]].{{sfn|New York Review of Books|2006}}{{sfn|Van Reybrouck|2014|p=95}}

Allegations of genocide in the Free State have become common over time. According to historian [[Timothy J. Stapleton]], "Those who easily apply the term genocide to Leopold's regime seem to do so purely on the basis of its obvious horror and the massive numbers of people who may have perished."{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|pp=88–89}}
One of the few historians to use the term is [[Robert Weisbord]] who argued, in a 2003 article, that there does not have to be intent to exterminate all members of a population in a genocide.{{sfn|Vanthemsche|2012|p=24}} He posited that "an endeavor to eliminate a portion of a people would qualify as genocide" according to the UN standards and asserted that the Free State did as much. Jeanne Haskin and Yaa-Lengi Meema Ngemi also refer to the atrocities as a genocide.{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=88}} [[Raphael Lemkin]], coiner of the term "genocide", authored a manuscript in the 1950s (it was not published) that asserted the occurrence of "an unambiguous genocide" in the Free State, attributing most of the population decline to the repressive actions of colonial troops.{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=87}} In 2005, an [[early day motion]] before the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]], introduced by [[Andrew Dismore]], called for the recognition of the Congo Free State's atrocities as a "colonial genocide" and called on the Belgian government to issue a formal apology. It was supported by 48 MPs.{{sfn|Early day motion 2251}}

The term "Congolese Genocide" is often used in an unrelated sense to refer to the mass murder and rape committed in the eastern Congo in the aftermath of the [[Rwandan Genocide]] (and the ensuing [[Second Congo War]]) between 1998 and 2003.{{sfn|Drumond|2011}}{{sfn|World Without Genocide|2012}}

'''Book burning''' is the ritual destruction by fire of books or other written materials, usually carried out in a public context. The burning of books represents an element of [[censorship]] and usually proceeds from a cultural, religious, or political opposition to the materials in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005852 |title=Holocaust Encyclopedia: Book Burning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, the destroyed works are irreplaceable and their burning constitutes a severe loss to [[cultural heritage]]. Examples include the [[burning of books and burying of scholars]] under China's [[Qin Dynasty]] (213–210 [[BCE]]), the burning of the [[Library of Alexandria]] (c. 49), the obliteration of the [[House of Wisdom|Library of Baghdad]] (1258), the destruction of [[Aztec codices]] by [[Itzcoatl]] (1430s), and the burning of [[Maya codices]] on the order of bishop [[Diego de Landa]] (1562).

In other cases, such as the [[Nazi book burnings]], other copies of the destroyed books survive, but the instance of book burning becomes emblematic of a harsh and oppressive regime which is seeking to censor or silence an aspect of a nation's culture.

Book burning can be an act of contempt for the book's contents or author, and the act is intended to draw wider public attention to this opinion. Examples include the burning of [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s books by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] and the [[2010 Qur'an-burning controversy]].

[[Art destruction]] is related to book burning, both because it might have similar cultural, religious, or political connotations, and because in various historical cases books and artworks were destroyed at the same time.

In modern times, other forms of media, such as [[gramophone record|phonograph records]], [[Video|video tapes]], and [[Compact disc|CDs]] have also been burned, shredded, or crushed.

When the burning is widespread and systematic, destruction of books and media can become a significant component of [[cultural genocide]].  

==Historical background==
[[File:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|thumb|In 1933, Nazis burned works of Jewish authors, and other works considered "un-German", at the library of the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] in Berlin.]]

The burning of books has a long history as a tool wielded by authorities both [[civil authority|secular]] and [[Religion|religious]], in efforts to suppress [[dissent]]ing or [[heresy|heretical]] views that are perceived as posing a [[threat]] to the prevailing order.

=== 700 BC===

According to the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), in the 7th century BCE King [[Jehoiakim]] of Judah burned part of a scroll Baruch ben Neriah had written at prophet [[Jeremiah]]'s dictation (Jeremiah 36).

=== Burning of books and burying of scholars in China (210-213 BC) ===
[[File:Killing the Scholars, Burning the Books.jpg|thumb|[[Burning of books and burying of scholars|''Killing the Scholars and Burning the Books'']] in 210-213 BC (18th century Chinese painting).]]

[[Qin Shi Huang]], first emperor of [[Qin Dynasty]], ordered a [[Burning of books and burying of scholars]] in 213 BC and [[burial alive]] of 460 Confucian scholars in 210 BC in order to stay in the throne. Some of these books were written in [[Shang Xiang]], a superior school founded in 2208 BC. The event caused the loss of many philosophical treatises of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]. The official philosophy of government ("[[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]]") survived.

=== Christian burnings ===
In Acts in the New Testament Paul performed an exorcism in Ephesus. After men in Ephesus failed to perform the same feat many gave up their "curious arts" and burned the books because apparently they didn't work.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And many that believed, came and confessed and shewed their deeds. Many of them also which used curious arts, brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.&lt;ref&gt;
Acts 19:18-20.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the [[First Council of Nicea]] (325 AD), Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]] issued an [[edict]] against [[nontrinitarian]] [[Arians]] which included a prescription for systematic book-burning: &lt;blockquote&gt; "In addition, if any writing composed by [[Arius]] should be found, it should be handed over to the flames, so that not only will the wickedness of his teaching be obliterated, but nothing will be left even to remind anyone of him. And I hereby make a public order, that if someone should be discovered to have hidden a writing composed by Arius, and not to have immediately brought it forward and destroyed it by fire, his penalty shall be death. As soon as he is discovered in this offense, he shall be submitted for capital punishment....."&lt;ref&gt;Edict by Emperor Constantine against the Arians. {{cite web |last= Athanasius |title= Edict by Emperor Constantine against the Arians |url= http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/urkunde-33 |work= Fourth Century Christianity |publisher= Wisconsin Lutheran College |accessdate= 2 May 2012 |date= 23 January 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110819215807/http://www.fourthcentury.com/index.php/urkunde-33 |archivedate= 19 August 2011 |df= dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; According to [[Elaine Pagels]], "In AD 367, [[Athanasius]], the zealous bishop of [[Alexandria]]... issued an Easter letter in which he demanded that [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian monks]] destroy all such unacceptable writings, except for those he specifically listed as 'acceptable' even 'canonical'—a list that constitutes the present 'New Testament'".&lt;ref&gt;Elaine Pagels, ''Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas'' (Random House, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=pkSrV5cEBp8C&amp;pg=PT64&amp;lpg=PT64&amp;dq=%22Athanasius,+the+zealous+bishop%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=unXWU7aJPc&amp;sig=zzREpVJnvIgLLPmg55fONbDlCXI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YB7_U7LiOM_pggTCtoLoCg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Athanasius%2C%20the%20zealous%20bishop%22&amp;f=false n.p.]&lt;/ref&gt; (Pagels cites Athanasius's Paschal letter (letter 39) for 367 AD, which prescribes a canon but does not explicitly order monks to destroy excluded works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.xxv.iii.iii.xxv.html |title= NPNF2-04. Athanasius: Select Works and Letters |publisher= Ccel.org |date=13 July 2005 |accessdate= 21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date= August 2014}}) Heretical texts do not turn up as [[palimpsest]]s, scraped clean and overwritten, as do many [[Classical literature|texts of Classical antiquity]].  According to author Rebecca Knuth, multitudes of early [[Christian]] texts have been as thoroughly "destroyed" as if they had been publicly burnt.&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, R. (2006). ''Burning books and leveling libraries'', p. 13. Praeger, London. {{ISBN|0275990079}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Burning of the Library of Alexandria ====
{{Main|Destruction of the Library of Alexandria}}
The stories surrounding the loss of the great [[Library of Alexandria]] include:

* Emperor [[Aurelian]]'s (270–275 AD) sack of Alexandria in 272 AD, which badly damaged the section of the city which housed part of the library.
* Supposedly (but incorrectly) the religious riots aimed against pagan temples and their rituals in 391 AD, sanctioned by decree of Emperor [[Theodosius I]] and led by [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Pope]] [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Phillips|first1= Heather|title= The Great Library of Alexandria?|journal= Library Philosophy and Practice|date= 2010|url= http://unllib.unl.edu/LPP/phillips.htm|accessdate= 3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Much of its downfall was gradual, often bureaucratic, and by comparison to our cultural imaginings, somewhat petty."&lt;ref&gt;Heather Phillips (2010). "The Great Library of Alexandria?". Library Philosophy and Practice.&lt;/ref&gt; (Compare: El-Abbadi, M. (1990). The Life and Fate of the Ancient Library of Alexandria. Mayenne, France: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, for tales of survival of the collection, in part, into the era of the [[Caliphate]].)

==== Burning of Nestorian books ====
Activity by [[Cyril of Alexandria]] ({{circa}} 376–444) brought fire to almost all the writings of Nestorius (386-450) shortly after 435.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aina.org/books/mokk/mokk.htm#fn1 |title=The Monks of Kublai Khan |publisher=Aina.org |date= |accessdate=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'The writings of Nestorius were originally very numerous',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Chapman|first1= John|title= Nestorius and Nestorianism|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10755a.htm|website= New Advent|publisher= The Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company|accessdate= 25 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, they were not part of the Nestorian or Oriental theological curriculum until the mid-sixth century, unlike those of his teacher Theodore of Mopsuestia, and those of Diodorus of Tarsus, even then they were not key texts, so relatively few survive intact, cf. Baum, Wilhelm and Dietmar W. Winkler. 2003. The Church of the East: A Concise History. London: Routledge.

==== Burning of Arian books ====

According to the [[Chronicle of Fredegar]], [[Recared]], [[Visigothic Kingdom|King of the Visigoths]] (reigned 586–601) and first Catholic king of [[Hispania|Spain]], following his conversion to [[Catholicism]] in 587, ordered that all [[Arian]] books should be collected and burned; and all the books of Arian theology were reduced to ashes, along with the house in which they had been purposely collected.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan McMillan, Wolfgang van Emden, Philip E. Bennett, Alexander Kerr, Société Rencesvals, ''Guillaume d'Orange and the chanson de geste: essays presented to Duncan McMillan in celebration of his seventieth birthday by his friends and colleagues of the Société Rencesvals'', University of Reading, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', 1776–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Which facts demonstrate that Constantine's edict on Arian works was not rigorously observed, as Arian writings or the theology based on them survived to be burned much later in Spain.

==== Burning of Jewish manuscripts in 1244 ====

In 1244, as an outcome of the [[Disputation of Paris]], twenty-four carriage loads of [[Talmud]]s and other Jewish religious manuscripts were set on fire by French law officers  in the streets of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The history of the Talmud, from the time of its formation, about 200 B. C.|first= Michael Levi|last= Rodkinson|pages= 66–75|year= 1918|publisher= Talmud Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Judaism on Trial: Jewish-Christian Disputations in the Middle Ages|first= Hyam |last= Maccoby|year= 1982|publisher= Associated University Presses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Burning of Aztec and Mayan manuscripts in 1560s ====

During the conquest of the Americas and in the aftermath of the encounter between European and indigenous American civilizations, many books written by indigenous peoples were destroyed. There were many{{quantify|date=April 2018}} books written by the [[Aztec]]s in existence at the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] in the 16th century.{{cn|date=April 2018}} However, most were destroyed by the [[Conquistador]]s and the Catholic [[priests]], with the exception of the work of the priest [[Bartolomé de las Casas | Bartolome de la Casas]]. In particular, many books in [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] were ordered destroyed by [[Diego de Landa|Bishop Diego de Landa]] in July 1562. De Landa wrote: "We found a large number of books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they (the [[Maya peoples | Maya]]) regretted to an amazing degree, and which caused them much affliction." Ironically, most of the books that were destroyed by the Europeans were biased and based upon the Aztec people's version of the history of the region.{{cn|date=June 2018}} The Aztecs had previously conquered the area and destroyed many of the Mayan books and documents.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

=== Burning of Abbeys in Tudor and Stuart England ===

The schism between the Church of England and that of the Roman Catholic Church reached a tipping point during the Tudor and Stuart periods of England (1485-1603, 1603-1714), when the citizens loyal to Crown and Country sacked Abbeys and Monasteries across the British countryside, and pillaged their valuable books to burn, degrade, or destroy. David Cressy’s (2005) article, ''Book Burning in Tudor and Stuart England'' discussed the mechanics of these book burnings and how the enforcement was trickled down to the citizens; that everyone had a part in this “spectacle”. “Over the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries book burning developed from a rare to an occasional occurrence, relocated from an outdoor to an indoor procedure, and changed from a bureaucratic to a quasi-theatrical performance” &lt;ref&gt;Cressy, D. (2005). Book Burning in Tudor and Stuart England. The Sixteenth Century Journal, 36(2), 359-374. doi:10.2307/20477359&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Burning of US Library of Congress ===

The [[Library of Congress]] was founded in 1800, 24 years after the United States gained its independence from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. In 1814, 3,000 books from the [[Library of Congress]] were used by the British forces to burn down the [[US Capitol]] during the [[Burning of Washington]]. Although there were dissenting voices to this wanton destruction, the conflagration was motivated by a strong desire on the part of the British to humiliate the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Stuart|title=The Library: An Illustrated History|date=2009|publisher=Skyhorse Publishin|location=Chicago, IL|isbn= 9781616084530|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Institutions dedicated to book burnings ===

[[Anthony Comstock]]'s [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]], founded in 1873, inscribed book burning on its seal, as a worthy goal to be achieved. Comstock's total accomplishment in a long and influential career is estimated to have been the destruction of some 15&amp;nbsp;tons of books, 284,000&amp;nbsp;pounds of plates for printing such 'objectionable' books, and nearly 4,000,000 pictures. All of this material was defined as "[[Lascivious|lewd]]" by Comstock's very broad definition of the term—which he and his associates successfully lobbied the [[United States Congress]] to incorporate in the [[Comstock Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476 (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nazi regime (1933) ===
''Main: [[Nazi book burnings]]''

The Nazi government decreed broad grounds for burning material:

==Notable book burnings and destruction of libraries==
{{Main article|List of book-burning incidents|List of destroyed libraries}}

==Burnings by authors==
In 1588, the exiled English Catholic [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Cardinal Allen]] wrote "''[[An Admonition to the Nobility and People of England]]''", a work sharply attacking Queen [[Elizabeth I]]. It was to be published in Spanish-occupied England in the event of the [[Spanish Armada]] succeeding in its invasion. Upon the defeat of the Armada, Allen carefully consigned his publication to the fire, and it is only known of through one of Elizabeth's spies, who had stolen a copy.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic encyclopedia'', "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01727c.htm Spanish Armada]".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hassid]]ic Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]] is reported to have written a book which he himself burned in 1808. To this day, his followers mourn "The Burned Book" and seek in their Rabbi's surviving writings for clues as to what the lost volume contained and why it was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acco-tour.50webs.com/SIDEMENU/aharonim/nahman.htm |title=עכותור - מדריכי טיולים לעיר עכו ולכל הארץ &amp;#124; מדריך טיולים &amp;#124; מסלולי טיול לקבוצות עברית + צרפתית |publisher=Acco-tour.50webs.com |date= |accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carlo Goldoni]] is known to have burned his first play, a [[tragedy]] called ''[[Amalasunta]]'', when encountering unfavorable criticism.

[[Nikolai Gogol]] burned the second half of his magnum opus ''[[Dead Souls]]'', having come under the influence of a priest who persuaded him that his work was sinful; Gogol later described this as a mistake.

In the 1870s [[Tchaikovsky]] destroyed the manuscript full score of his first opera, ''[[Voyevoda (opera)|The Voyevoda]]''. During the Soviet period ''The Voyevoda'' was posthumously reconstructed from surviving orchestral and vocal parts and the composer's sketches. 

After [[Hector Hugh Munro]] (better known by the [[pen name]] ''Saki'') was killed in [[World War I]] in November 1916, his sister Ethel destroyed most of his papers.

[[Joe Shuster]], who together with [[Jerry Siegel]] created the [[fictional]] [[superhero]] [[Superman]], in 1938 burned the first Superman story when under the impression that it would not find a publisher.

==Books saved from burning==
[[File:NewYorkSocietyForTheSuppressionOfVice.jpg|thumb|right|Symbol of the "[[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]]", advocating book-burning]]

In Catholic [[hagiography]], Saint [[Vincent of Saragossa]] is mentioned as having been offered his life on condition that he consign Scripture to the fire; he refused and was martyred. He is often depicted holding the book which he protected with his life.

Another book-saving Catholic Saint is the Tenth Century St. [[Wiborada]]. She is credited with having predicted in 925 a [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasion]] of her region in Switzerland. Her warning allowed the priests and religious of St. Gall and St. Magnus to hide their books and wine and escape into caves in nearby hills.&lt;ref name="library"&gt;{{cite mailing list | last =O'Donnell | first =Jim | publisher =[[Georgetown University]] | title =Patron saints | mailinglist =liblicense-l@lists.yale.edu | date =2003-11-20 | url =http://www.library.yale.edu/~llicense/ListArchives/0311/msg00071.html | accessdate =2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wiborada herself refused to escape and was killed by the marauders, being later canonized. In art, she is commonly represented holding a book to signify the library she saved, and is considered a patron saint of [[library|libraries]] and librarians.

At the beginning of the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] in the [[World War II]], two German officers - Viennese-born Lt.Col. Julius Schlegel (a Roman Catholic), and Captain Maximilian Becker (a Protestant) - had the foresight to transfer the [[Monte Cassino]] archives to the Vatican. Otherwise the archives - containing a vast number of documents relating to the 1500-years' history of the Abbey as well as some 1,400 irreplaceable manuscript [[Codex|codices]], chiefly [[patristic]] and historical  -  would have been destroyed in the Allied air bombing which almost completely destroyed the Abbey shortly afterwards. Also saved by the two officers' prompt action were the collections of the [[Keats-Shelley Memorial House]] in Rome which had been sent to the Abbey for safety in December 1942.

The [[Sarajevo Haggadah]] - one of the oldest and most valuable Jewish [[illustrated manuscript]]s, with immense historical and cultural value - was hidden from the [[Nazism|Nazis]] and their [[Ustashe]] collaborators by Derviš Korkut, chief librarian of the National Museum in [[Sarajevo]]. At risk to his own life, Korkut smuggled the Haggadah out of Sarajevo and gave it for safekeeping to a Muslim cleric in [[Zenica]], where it was hidden until the end of the war under the floorboards of either a mosque or a Muslim home. The Haggadah again survived destruction during the wars which followed the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geraldinebrooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Korkut_near-final-pages.pdf|title= The Book of Exodus: A Double Rescue in Wartime Sarajevo|date=3 December 2007|last=Brooks|first=Geraldine|format=PDF| journal=The New Yorker|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1940's France, a group of anti-fascist exiles created a Library of Burned Books which housed all the books that [[Adolf Hitler]] had destroyed. This library contained copies of titles that were burned.  These book burnings from the Nazis was an idea to help cleanse German culture of Jewish and foreign influences such as pacifist and decadent literature. The Nazis were going to make a "museum" of Judaism once the ''[[Final Solution]]'' was complete to house certain books that were saved by the Nazis themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books:A Living History|year=2011|publisher=J.Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book burning wills==

When [[Virgil]] died, he left instructions that [[Aeneid#Virgil's death and editing of the Aeneid|his manuscript of the ''Aeneid'' was to be burnt]], as it was a draft version with uncorrected faults and not a final version for release. However, this instruction was ignored. It is mainly to the ''Aeneid'', published in this "imperfect" form, that Virgil owes his lasting fame – and it is considered one of the great masterpieces of classical literature as a whole.

Before his death, [[Franz Kafka]] wrote to his friend and [[literary executor]] [[Max Brod]]: "Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Publisher's Note to ''The Castle'', Schocken Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Brod overrode Kafka's wishes, believing that Kafka had given these directions to him, specifically, because Kafka knew he would not honour them – Brod had told him as much. Had Brod carried out Kafka's instructions, virtually the whole of Kafka's work – except for a few short stories published in his lifetime – would have been lost forever. Most critics, at the time and up to the present, justify Brod's decision.

A similar case concerns the noted American poet [[Emily Dickinson]], who died in 1886 and left to her sister Lavinia the instruction of burning all her papers. Lavinia Dickinson did burn almost all of her sister's correspondences, but interpreted the will as not including the forty notebooks and loose sheets, all filled with almost 1800 poems; these Lavinia saved and began to publish the poems that year. Had Lavinia Dickinson been more strict in carrying out her sister's will, all but a small handful of Emily Dickinson's poetic work would have been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Habegger|first=Alfred|title=My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson|year=2001|page=604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farr (ed.)|first=Judith|title=Emily Dickinson: A Collection of Critical Essays|year=1996|publisher=Prentice Hall International Paperback Editions|isbn=978-0-13-033524-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern biblioclasm==
Biblioclasm still occurs. All over the world schools and libraries have been destroyed in recent years. Despite the act of destroying books being condemned by the majority of society, people still participate on small and/or large scale.

In Azerbaijan, when a modified Latin alphabet was adopted, books published in Arabic script were burned, especially in the late 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Aziza Jafarzade, "[http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai141_folder/141_articles/141_aziza_jafarzade.html Memoirs of 1937: Burning Our Books, The Arabic Script Goes Up in Flames]," in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 14:1 (Spring 2006), pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The texts were not limited to the Quran; medical and historical manuscripts were also destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Asaf Rustamov, [http://azeri.org/Azeri/az_english/73_folder/73_articles/73_justforkids.html "The Day They Burned Our Books,"] in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 7:3 (Autumn 1999), pp. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Book burnings were organised regularly in [[Nazi Germany]] in the 1930s by [[Sturmabteilung|stormtroopers]] to destroy ''degenerate'' works, especially by Jewish authors such as [[Thomas Mann]], [[Marcel Proust]] and [[Karl Marx]].

In the 1950s, over six tons of books by [[William Reich]] were burned in the U.S. under judicial orders.&lt;ref name="IDP"&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/reich-wilhelm Reich, Wilhelm (1897-1957)], International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Denmark]], a [[comic book]] burning took place 23 June 1955. It was a [[bonfire]] consisting of comic books and on top of that a life size cardboard cutout of [[The Phantom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/fantomet-paa-baalet-1955/ |title=Fantomet på bålet 1955 |publisher=Danmarkshistorien.dk |date=1940-04-09 |accessdate=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kjell Ludvik Kvavik, a senior Norwegian official, had a penchant for removing maps and other pages from rare books and was noticed in January 1983 by a young college student. The student, Barbro Andenaes, reported the actions of the senior official to the superintendent of the reading room and then to the head librarian of the university library in Oslo. Hesitant to make public something that would greatly hurt the career of Kvavik even if the accusation proved false, media kept the name of the perpetrator quiet until his house was searched by police. The authorities seized 470 maps and prints as well as 112 books that Kvavik had illegally obtained. While this may not be the large scale, violent demonstration seen during wars, Kvavik's disregard for libraries and books shows that destruction of books on any scale can affect an entire country. Here, a senior official in the Norwegian government was disgraced and the University Library was refunded only a small portion of the costs it incurred from the loss and destruction of rare materials as well as the security changes that had to be made. In this case, the draw of personal profit and enhancing one's own collection was the cause of the defacement of rare books and maps. While the main goal was not destruction for destruction's sake, the resulting damage to the ephemera still carries weight within the library community.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Lawrence. "Biblioclasm in Norway". ''Library and Archival Security'' 6. (1984): 13-16.&lt;/ref&gt;


In 1984, Amsterdam's South African Institute was infiltrated by an organized group bent on drawing attention to the inequality of the apartheid. Well-organized and ensuring patrons of the library that no harm would come to them, group members systematically smashed microfiche machines and threw books into the nearby waterway. Indiscriminate of the content being destroyed, shelf after shelf was cleared of its contents until the group left. Staff members fished books from the water in hopes of salvaging the rare editions of travel books, documents about the Boer Wars, and contemporary materials both for and against apartheid. Many were destroyed by oil, ink, and paint that the anti-apartheid demonstrators had flung around the library. The world was outraged at the loss of knowledge that these demonstrators had caused, and instead of winning support and getting attention on the issue of apartheid, the international audience cried out against the actions at the Amsterdam's South African Institute. Some demonstrators came forward to explain that they believed the institute was pro-apartheid and that nothing was being done to change the status quo in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, Rebecca.

The advent of the digital age has resulted in an immense collection of written work being catalogued exclusively or primarily in digital form. The intentional deletion or removal of these works has been often referred to as a new form of book burning.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggiero, Lucia. (n.d.). Digital books; could they make censorship and "book burning" easier? ''Digital Meets Culture''. Retrieved 22 October 2015, from

Some supporters have celebrated book burning cases in art and other media. Such is the bas-relief by [[Giovanni Battista Maini]] of ''The Burning of Heretical Books'' over a side door on the façade of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome, which depicts the burning of 'heretical' books as a triumph of righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;Noted in Touring Club Italiano, ''Roma e Dintorni'' 1965:344.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, during the years of the Chilean fascist dictatorship under [[Augusto Pinochet]], hundreds of books were burned as a way of repression and censorship of leftist literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Burning Books|last=Bosmajian|first=Haig|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=0786422084|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/the-books-have-been-burning-1.887172 |title=The books have been burning - World - CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar incident also occurred in [[Mullumbimby]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] in 2009. Reported as "just like the ritual burning of books in Nazi Germany", a book-burning ceremony was held by students of the "socially harmful cult" [[Universal Medicine]], an [[Alice Bailey#Esoteric Healing|esoteric healing]] business owned by Serge Benhayon.&lt;ref name="Whitbourn"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/self-styled-healer-serge-benhayon-leads-socially-harmful-cult-jury-20181010-p508ux.html|title=Self-styled healer Serge Benhayon leads 'socially harmful cult': jury|last1=Whitbourn|first1=Michaela|date=October 15, 2018|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students were invited to throw their books onto the [[pyre]].

In 1981, the [[Jaffna Public Library]] in Jaffna, Sri Lanka was [[Burning of Jaffna Public Library|burned down]] by Sinhalese police and paramilitaries during a pogrom against the minority Tamil population. At the time of its burning it contained almost 100,000 Tamil books and rare documents.&lt;ref&gt;Knuth, Rebecca. ''Burning Books and Leveling Libraries: Extremist Violence and Cultural Destruction''.

It is estimated that during 1990s in [[Croatia]] over 2,8 million books were destroyed by the Croatian government. Those were the books written in [[Cyrillic]], written in Ekavian version of [[Serbo-Croatian]],  written by the Serbs or by "unsuitable" Croats. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.jutarnji.hr/kultura/knjizevnost/lesaja-devedesetih-smo-unistili-28-mil.-%E2%80%98nepocudnih%E2%80%99-knjiga/1540434/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.express.hr/kultura/mracne-90-e-hdz-ova-politika-unistila-je-i-spalila-28-milijuna-knjiga-1635&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikh book burning==
In the [[Sikh]] religion, any copies of their sacred Guru, [[Guru Granth Sahib]] which are too badly damaged to be used, and any printer's waste which bears any of its text, are cremated. Such a cremation is called ''Agan Bhet'', and is similar to that performed when cremating a deceased Sikh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harjas.com/downloads/Press_Release_BC_Sikh_Community_March30.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Harjas.com |title=Presss Release BC Sikh Community |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615224715/http://www.harjas.com/downloads/Press_Release_BC_Sikh_Community_March30.pdf |archivedate=15 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sikhnn.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=383 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007130434/http://www.sikhnn.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=383 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-07 |publisher=Sikhnn.com |title=4 copies damaged in New Orleans by the flood caused by Hurricane Katrina |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitedsikhs.org/ghanaia/0121051.html |title= on the Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami (end of page) |publisher=unitedsikhs.org |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2006/01/happiness-and-siri-guru-granth-sahib_09.html |publisher=Mrsikhnet.com |title=Blog query about an accumulation of download printouts of Sikh sacred text |date= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110133818/http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2006/01/happiness-and-siri-guru-granth-sahib_09.html |archivedate=10 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book burnings in popular culture==
&lt;!-- Please include citations for any entries in this section, to keep it from becoming a list of trivia. See [[WP:INPOPCULTURE]]. --&gt;
In his 1821 play, ''Almansor'', the German writer [[Heinrich Heine]]—referring to the burning of the [[Muslim]] holy book, the [[Qur'an]], during the [[Spanish Inquisition]]—wrote, "Where they burn books, so too will they in the end burn human beings." ("''Dort, wo man Bücher verbrennt, verbrennt man auch am Ende Menschen.''") Over a century later, Heine's own books were among the thousands of [[List of book-burning incidents#Jewish, anti-Nazi and "degenerate" books (by the Nazis)|volumes that were torched]] by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in Berlin's [[Bebelplatz|Opernplatz]], even while his poem [[Die Lorelei]] continued to be printed in German schoolbooks as "by an unknown author".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/10/book-burning-quran-history-nazis|title=Book-burning: fanning the flames of hatred|last=Henley|first=Jon|date=10 September 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ray Bradbury|Ray Bradbury's]] [[Fahrenheit 451]], the book deals with the concept of censorship via burning books. It is said that Bradbury wrote the book due to his concerns of literature being burned in America during the McCarthy era and as well, fearing that mass media (television especially) reduce the interest in reading books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-13|title=Fahrenheit 451|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fahrenheit_451&amp;oldid=836176213|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese light novel series {{Nihongo|[[Library War]]|図書館戦争|Toshokan Sensō}}, by [[Hiro Arikawa]], describes how an armed Library Defence Force protects libraries from censorship after a lethal attack at library. Which is later adapted to manga, 12-episode anime, internet radio shows, and finally live action films and special TV episode.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3239">In [[geometry]], a '''centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT)''' is a special type of Voronoi tessellation or [[Voronoi diagram]].  A Voronoi tessellation is called centroidal when the generating point of each Voronoi cell is also its mean (center of mass).  It can be viewed as an optimal partition corresponding to an optimal distribution of generators. A number of algorithms can be used to generate centroidal Voronoi tessellations, including [[Lloyd's algorithm]] for [[K-means clustering]].

Gersho's conjecture, proven for one and two dimensions, says that "asymptotically speaking, all cells of the optimal CVT, while forming a [[tessellation]], are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to a basic cell which depends on the dimension."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Qiang|last1=Du|first2=Desheng|last2=Wang|title=The Optimal Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations and the Gersho's Conjecture in the Three-Dimensional Space|journal=Computers and Mathematics with Applications|issue=49|year=2005|pages=1355–1373}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In two dimensions, the basic cell for the optimal CVT is a regular [[hexagon]].

Centroidal Voronoi tessellations are useful in [[data compression]], optimal [[Numerical integration|quadrature]], optimal [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]], [[Data clustering|clustering]], and optimal mesh generation.&lt;ref name="Du_2"&gt;{{citation|first1=Qiang|last1=Du|first2=Vance|last2=Faber|author2-link=Vance Faber|first3=Max|last3=Gunzburger|title=Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations: Applications and Algorithms|doi=10.1137/S0036144599352836|journal=SIAM Review|volume=41|issue=4|pages=637–676|year=1999|citeseerx=10.1.1.452.2448}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[patterns in nature|patterns seen in nature]] are closely approximated by a Centroidal Voronoi tessellation. Examples of this include the [[Giant's Causeway]], the cells of the [[cornea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pigatto | first1 = João Antonio Tadeu | display-authors = etal   | year = 2009 | title = Scanning electron microscopy of the corneal endothelium of ostrich | url = | journal = Cienc.

A weighted centroidal Voronoi diagrams is a CVT in which each centroid is weighted according to a certain function. For example, a [[grayscale]] image can be used as a density function to weight the points of a CVT, as a way to create digital [[stippling]].&lt;ref&gt;Secord, Adrian. "Weighted voronoi stippling." Proceedings of the 2nd international symposium on Non-photorealistic animation and rendering. ACM, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
'''Chidākāsha''' in which all gross and subtle activities of the consciousness take place; it is the sky of consciousness, everything dies and evaporates in this space of consciousness, everything is reduced to its essence in this space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Iyngar:The Yoga Master|publisher=Shambala Publications|page=199|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=92c7BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0DyhVMTtNcSiugTIkoDYCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the mind (conditioned consciousness), along with intellect and ego, merges in this space of unconditioned Pure Consciousness through the paths of devotion, knowledge and action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Self Unfoldment|author=Swami Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=142|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-ia18fu2rEAC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bj6hVJDXDI7luQTF5oLgCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also associated with the [[Ajna|ajna chakra]], the guru chakra, positioned in the stomata behind the centre of the forehead.

[[Yoga Vasistha]] speaks about the ''bhutākāsha'' – dealing with gross matter, ''chittākāsha'' – dealing with mental concepts and ''chidākāsha'' with the '' [[Atman (Hinduism)|ātman]] ''. These are spaces projected by the mind but all spaces are reduced to one, that is, to the ultimate space which is one’s own true self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Twirling of a Lotus|publisher=Lulu.com|page=104|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gnxGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT104&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mj2hVObuNdOQuATX3IHoCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chittākāsha'' is the field of the mind which provokes a deeper enquiry because there is in it still the duality of the 'seer' (''drg'')  and the 'seen' (''drshya''); this duality ceases to exist in ''chidākāsha'' which is the field of Pure Consciousness viewed by the mind non-casually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Being in Depth|author=Swami Ranganathananda|publisher=SUNY Press|page=86|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=P0vfFZh9BIIC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ej-hVLGKDtSOuATkjoDoCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different mental spaces are seen when the mind ventures outwards to see all that which exists externally, but what already exists externally exists within contained in the inner mental space whose nature is different in different planes, and because consciousness functions variously in varying dimensions depending upon fineness of matter, the number of dimensions and the varying subtlety of the mind. ''Chidākāsha'' is the result of Divine Ideation which makes the world a mental projection that functions within time and space to give itself a semblance of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, God, and the Universe|author=I.K.Taimni|publisher=Quest Books|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=hQ4qn61v_UAC&amp;pg=PA350&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0DyhVMTtNcSiugTIkoDYCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chidākāsha'' also means the space of consciousness and the space behind the forehead which is the seat of visualization that links man with the conscious, subconscious and super-conscious and also the object of meditation or ''[[iṣṭa-devatā|ishta deva]]''; it helps gain insight into the connection between the two confronting worlds – the higher that is beyond all objects and thought and the lower which is the material world of senses. Subtle vision is developed though practice of ''Chidākāsha dhāranā''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spiritual Art and Education|author=Janis Lander|publisher=Routledge|page=62|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IH5iAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mj2hVObuNdOQuATX3IHoCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bhutākāsha'' is the space outside, the outside world of objects that the senses meet and a mere reflection of the infinite within; ''Chidākāsha'' is the space within which having turned the mind inwardly the sublime objectless infinite is to be realized through ''Adhyātma Vidyā''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Concepts of Space Ancient and Modern|author=Kapila Vatsyayan|publisher=Abhinava Publications|page=47|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=T9B0AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0DyhVMTtNcSiugTIkoDYCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Vivekachudamani]], [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] reminds that the first means to [[yoga]] is control of speech, then cessation of sense organ activity, control of mind and control of intellect. He states:-

:समाहितायां सति चित्तवृत्तौ परात्मनि ब्रह्मणि निर्विकल्पे |
:न दृश्यते कश्चिदयं विकल्पः प्रजल्पमात्रः परिशिष्यते ततः ||

: "If the mental functions are established in the true, unchanging, Higher Self, Brahman, this awareness of the phenomenal world is not experienced. What remains thereafter is merely a matter of meaningless word. " – ([[shloka]] 399)

Then all wrong identifications and knowledge of the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|anatman]] cease to survive, there is complete removal of sorrow, and all that remains is the Infinite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=270|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Vivekacudamani.html?id=J-U3twAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yama]] tells [[Nachiketa]]:-

:हँसः शुचिषद्वसुरान्तरिक्षसद्-होता वेदिषदतिथिर्दुरोणसत् |
:नृषद्वरसदृतसद्व्योमसद् अब्जा गोजा ऋतजा अद्रिजा ऋतं बृहत् ||

: "The Immortal Self (Ātman) is the sun shining in the sky, he is the breeze blowing in space, he is the fire burning on the altar, he is the guest dwelling in the house; he is in all men, he is in the gods, he is in the ether, he is wherever there is truth; he is the fish that is born in waters, he is the plant that grows in the soil, he is the river that gushes from the mountain, - he is the changeless reality, the illimitable. " – ([[Katha Upanishad]] II.ii.2) 
and,

:अग्निर्यथैको भुवनं प्रविष्टो रूपं रूपं प्रतिरूपो बभूव |
:एकस्तथा सर्वभूतान्तरात्मा रूपं रूपं प्रतिरूपो बहिश्च || २.२.९

:"As the one fire, after it has entered the world, though one, takes different forms according to whatever it burns, so does the internal Atman of all beings, though one, takes a form according to whatever He enters and is outside all forms. " - ([[Katha Upanishad]] II.ii.9)

In other words, Nachiketa is told about the pre-eminence of the all-encompassing Brahman who is everything and who pervades all things. He is told about [[Brahman]] shining brightly in the sky ('' [[akasha]] '') in subtle ether, in the sky of the ''Chidākāsha'' the infinite all –pervading subtle space of Consciousness ; the Self which produces all movement in the universe, shines in the ''Chidākāsha'' lighting up all worlds gross and subtle because of the emanation of [[Om]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Upanishads|publisher=Islamkotob|pages=118–119|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FNzTC6Nmy6gC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=chidakasha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0DyhVMTtNcSiugTIkoDYCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=chidakasha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of authors have carried out comparisons of [[Nazism]] and [[Stalinism]], in which they have considered the similarities and differences of the two ideologies and [[political systems]], what relationship existed between the two regimes, and why both of them came to prominence at the same time. During the 20th century, the comparison of [[Stalinism]] and [[Nazism]] was made on the topics of [[totalitarianism]], ideology, and [[personality cult]]. Both regimes were seen in contrast to the liberal West, with an emphasis on the similarities between the two.&lt;ref name="Geyer2"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[political scientist]]s [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Carl Friedrich]] and historian [[Robert Conquest]] were prominent advocates of applying the "totalitarian" concept to compare Nazism and Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;Geyer, pp.&amp;nbsp;4–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reflections2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Conquest|title=Reflections on a Ravaged Century|date=1999|isbn=0-393-04818-7|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The various authors are listed in chronological order, by the date of publication of the earliest work cited in their section. --&gt;
== Hannah Arendt==
[[File:Hannah arendt-150x150.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hannah Arendt]] was one of the first scholars to propose that the regimes of Hitler and Stalin could be grouped in the same political category.]]
===The origins of totalitarianism===
One of the first scholars to publish a comparative study of Nazi Germany and Stalin’s Soviet Union was [[Hannah Arendt]]. In her 1951 work, ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Arendt puts forward the idea of [[totalitarianism]] as a distinct type of political movement and form of government, which “differs essentially from other forms of political oppression known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Arendt distinguishes between a totalitarian movement (such as a political party with totalitarian aims) and a totalitarian government. Not all totalitarian movements succeed in creating totalitarian governments once they gain power. In Arendt’s view, although many totalitarian movements existed in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, only the governments of Stalin and Hitler succeeded in fully implementing their totalitarian aims.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arendt traced the origin of totalitarian movements to the nineteenth century, focusing especially on [[antisemitism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]]. She emphasized the connection between the rise of European [[nation-state]]s and the growth of antisemitism, which was due to the fact that the Jews represented an “inter-European, non-national element in a world of growing or existing nations.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]] abounded, and the Jews were accused of being part of various international schemes to ruin European nations.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Small antisemitic political parties formed in response to this perceived Jewish threat, and, according to Arendt, these were the first political organizations in Europe that claimed to represent the interests of the whole nation as opposed to the interests of a class or other social group.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The later totalitarian movements would copy or inherit this claim to speak for the whole nation, with the implication that any opposition to them constituted treason.

European [[New Imperialism|imperialism of the nineteenth century]] also paved the way for totalitarianism, by legitimizing the concept of endless expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; After Europeans had engaged in imperialist expansion on other continents, political movements developed which aimed to copy the methods of imperialism on the European continent itself. Arendt refers specifically to the “[[Pan-nationalism|pan-movements]]” of [[pan-Germanism]] and [[pan-Slavism]], which promised continental empires to nations that had little hope of overseas expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arendt, “Nazism and Bolshevism owe more to Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism (respectively) than to any other ideology or political movement.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruitment, propaganda and indoctrination===
Arendt argues that both the Nazi and Bolshevik movements “recruited their members from [a] mass of apparently indifferent people whom all other parties had given up,”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; and who “had reason to be equally hostile to all parties.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, totalitarian movements did not need to use debate or persuasion, and did not need to refute the arguments of the other parties. Their target audience did not have to be persuaded to despise the other parties or the democratic system, because it consisted of people who already despised mainstream politics. As a result, totalitarian movements were free to use violence and terror against their opponents without fear that this might alienate their own supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of arguing against their opponents, they adopted [[determinism|deterministic]] views of human behavior and presented opposing ideas as “originating in deep natural, social, or psychological sources beyond the control of the individual and therefore beyond the power of reason.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis in particular, during the years before their rise to power, engaged in “killing small socialist functionaries or influential members of opposing parties” both as a means to intimidate opponents and as a means of demonstrating to their supporters that they were a party of action, “different from the ‘idle talkers’ of other parties.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian governments make extensive use of propaganda, and are often characterized by having a strong distinction between what they tell their own supporters and the propaganda they produce for others. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt distinguishes these two categories as "indoctrination" and "propaganda". Indoctrination consists of the message that a totalitarian government promotes internally, to the members of the ruling party and that segment of the population which supports the government. Propaganda consists of the message that a totalitarian government seeks to promote in the outside world, and also among those parts of its own society which may not support the government. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, “the necessities for propaganda are always dictated by the outside world,” while the opportunities for indoctrination depend on “the totalitarian governments’ isolation and security from outside interference.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of indoctrination used by the Soviets and the Nazis was characterized by claims of “scientific” truth, and appeals to “objective laws of nature.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; Both movements took a [[determinism|deterministic]] view of human society and claimed that their ideologies were based on scientific discoveries regarding race (in the case of the Nazis) or the forces governing human history (in the case of the Soviets). Arendt identifies this as being in certain ways similar to modern [[advertising]], in which companies claim that scientific research shows their products to be superior, but more generally she argues that it is an extreme version of “that obsession with science which has characterized the Western world since the rise of mathematics and physics in the sixteenth century.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; By their use of [[pseudoscience]] as the main justification for their actions, Nazism and Stalinism are distinguished from earlier historical despotic regimes, who appealed instead to [[religion]] or sometimes did not try to justify themselves at all. According to Arendt, totalitarian governments did not merely use these appeals to supposed scientific laws as propaganda to manipulate others. Rather, totalitarian leaders like Hitler and Stalin genuinely believed that they were acting in accordance with immutable natural laws, to such an extent that they were willing to sacrifice the self-interest of their regimes for the sake of enacting those supposed laws.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Nazis treated the inhabitants of occupied territories with extreme brutality and planned to depopulate Eastern Europe in order to make way for colonists from the German “[[herrenvolk|master race]],” despite the fact that this actively harmed their war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin repeatedly [[Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|purged the Communist Party]] of people who deviated even slightly from the party line, even when this weakened the party or the Soviet government, because he believed that they represented the interests of “dying classes” and their demise was historically inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Leader===
Arendt also identifies the central importance of an all-powerful leader in totalitarian movements. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; As in other areas, she distinguishes between totalitarian leaders (such as Hitler and Stalin) and non-totalitarian dictators or autocratic leaders. The totalitarian leader does not rise to power by personally using violence or through any special organizational skills, but rather by controlling appointments of personnel within the party, so that all other prominent party members owe their positions to him.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; With loyalty to the leader becoming the primary criterion for promotion, ambitious party members compete with each other in trying to express their loyalty, and a [[cult of personality]] develops around the leader. Even when the leader is not particularly competent and the members of his inner circle are aware of his deficiencies, they remain committed to him out of fear that without him the entire power structure would collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "enemies"===
Once in power, according to Arendt, totalitarian movements face a major dilemma: they built their support on the basis of anger against the status quo and on impossible or dishonest promises, but now they have become the new status quo and are expected to carry out their promises.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; They deal with this problem by engaging in a constant struggle against external and internal enemies, real or imagined, so as to enable them to say that, in a sense, they have not yet gained the power they need to fulfill their promises. According to Arendt, totalitarian governments must be constantly fighting enemies in order to survive. This explains their apparently irrational behavior, for example when Hitler continued to make territorial demands even after he was offered everything he asked for in the [[Munich Agreement]], or when Stalin unleashed the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] despite the fact that he faced no significant internal opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concentration camps===
Arendt points out the widespread use of [[concentration camp]]s by totalitarian governments, arguing that they are the most important manifestation of the need to find enemies to fight against, and are therefore “more essential to the preservation of the regime’s power than any of its other institutions.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; Although forced labor was commonly imposed on inmates of concentration camps, Arendt argues that their primary purpose was not any kind of material gain for the regime: “The only permanent economic function of the camps has been the financing of their own supervisory apparatus; thus from the economic point of view the concentration camps exist mostly for their own sake.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis in particular carried this to the point of “open anti-utility,” by expending large sums of money, resources and manpower – during a war – for the purpose of building and staffing [[extermination camps]] and transporting people to them.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; This sets apart the concentration camps of totalitarian regimes from older human institutions that bear some similarity to them, such as [[slavery]].  Slaves were abused and killed for the sake of profit; concentration camp inmates were abused and killed because a totalitarian government needed to justify its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Arendt points out that concentration camps under both Hitler and Stalin included large numbers of inmates who were innocent of any crime – not only in the ordinary sense of the word, but even by the standards of the regimes themselves. That is to say, most of the inmates had not actually committed any action against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;

===The future of totalitarian systems===
Throughout her analysis, Arendt emphasized the modernity and novelty of the governmental structures set up by Stalin and Hitler, arguing that they represented “an entirely new form of government” which is likely to manifest itself again in various other forms in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 478&lt;/ref&gt; She also cautioned against the belief that future totalitarian movements would necessarily share the ideological foundations of Nazism or Stalinism, writing that “all ideologies contain totalitarian elements.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 470&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski ==
[[File:Zbigniew Brzezinski, 1977.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] in 1977, the year he became [[National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)|United States National Security Advisor]] under president [[Jimmy Carter]].]]

===Totalitarian systems and autocracies===
The totalitarian paradigm in the comparative study of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union was further developed by [[Carl Joachim Friedrich|Carl Friedrich]] and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], who wrote extensively on this topic both individually and in collaboration. Similar to Hannah Arendt, they state that “totalitarian dictatorship is a new phenomenon; there has never been anything quite like it before.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski classify totalitarian dictatorship as a type of [[autocracy]], but argue that it is different in important ways from most other historical autocracies. In particular, it is distinguished by a reliance on modern technology and mass legitimation.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski apply the notion of totalitarian dictatorship not only to the regimes of Hitler and Stalin, but also to the USSR throughout its entire existence, as well as the regime of [[Benito Mussolini]] in Italy and the [[People’s Republic of China]] under [[Mao Zedong]].

Carl Friedrich noted that the “possibility of equating the dictatorship of Stalin in the Soviet Union and that of Hitler in Germany” has been a deeply controversial topic and a subject of debate almost from the beginning of those dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Various other aspects of the two regimes have also been the subject of intense scholarly debate, such as whether Nazi and Stalinist ideologies were genuinely believed and pursued by the respective governments, or whether the ideologies were merely convenient justifications for dictatorial rule.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich himself argues in favor of the former view.

Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that Nazism and Stalinism are not only similar to each other, but also represent a continuation or a return to the tradition of European [[absolute monarchy]] on certain levels.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In the absolute monarchies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the monarch ultimately held all decisional power, and was considered accountable only to God. In Stalinism and Nazism, the leader likewise held all real power, and was considered accountable only to various intangible entities such as “the people”, “the masses” or “the Volk.” Thus the common feature of autocracies – whether monarchical or totalitarian – is the concentration of power in the hands of a leader who cannot be held accountable by any legal mechanisms, and who is supposed to be the embodiment of the will of an abstract entity.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify other features common to all autocracies, such as “the oscillation between tight and loose control.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The regime alternates between periods of intense repression and periods of relative freedom, often represented by different leaders. This depends in part on the personal character of different leaders, but Friedrich and Brzezinski believe that there is also an underlying political cycle, in which rising discontent leads to increased repression up to the point at which the opposition is eliminated, then controls are relaxed until the next time that popular dissatisfaction begins to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, placing Stalinism and Nazism within the broader historical tradition of autocratic government, Friedrich and Brzezinski hold that “totalitarian dictatorship, in a sense, is the adaptation of autocracy to twentieth-century industrial society.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the same time, they insist that totalitarian dictatorship is a “''novel'' type of autocracy”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and argue that twentieth century totalitarian regimes (such as those of Hitler and Stalin) had more in common with each other than with any other form of government, including historical autocracies of the past. Totalitarianism can only exist after the creation of modern technology, because such technology is essential for [[propaganda]], for surveillance of the population, and for the operation of a [[secret police]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when speaking of the differences and similarities between fascist and communist regimes, Friedrich and Brzezinski insist that the two kinds of totalitarian governments are “basically alike” but “not wholly alike” – they are more similar to each other than to other forms of government, but they are not the same.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Among the major differences between them, Friedrich and Brzezinski identify in particular the fact that communists seek “the world revolution of the proletariat,” while fascists wish to “establish the imperial predominance of a particular nation or race.” &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five pillars of totalitarian systems===
In terms of the similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, Friedrich lists five main aspects that they hold in common: First, an official ideology that is supposed to be followed by all members of society, at least passively, and which promises to serve as a perfect guide towards some ultimate goal. Second, a [[one-party state|single political party]], composed of the most enthusiastic supporters of the official ideology, representing an elite group within society (no more than 10 percent of the population), and organized along strictly regimented lines. Third, “a technologically conditioned near-complete monopoly of control of all means of effective armed combat” in the hands of the party or its representatives. Fourth, a similar monopoly held by the party over the mass media and all technological forms of communication. Fifth, “a system of terroristic police control” that is not only used to defend the regime against real enemies, but also to persecute various groups of people who are only suspected of being enemies or who may potentially become enemies in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Two first pillars of any totalitarian government, according to Friedrich and Brzezinski, are the dictator and the Party. The dictator, whether Stalin, Hitler or Mussolini, holds supreme power. Friedrich and Brzezinski explicitly reject the claim that the Party, or any other institution, could provide a significant counterweight to the power of the dictator in Nazism or Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The dictator needs the Party in order to be able to rule, so he may be careful not to make decisions that would go directly against the wishes of other leading Party members, but ultimate authority rests with him and not with them. Like Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify the cult of personality surrounding the leader as an essential element of a totalitarian dictatorship, and reference Stalin’s personality cult in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; They also draw attention to the fact that Hitler and Stalin were expected to provide ideological direction for their governments and not merely practical leadership. Friedrich and Brzezinski write that “unlike military dictators in the past, but like certain types of primitive chieftains, the totalitarian dictator is both ruler and high priest.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, he not only governs, but also provides the principles on which his government is to be based. This is partly due to the way that totalitarian governments arise. They come about when a militant ideological movement seizes power, so the first leader of a totalitarian government is usually the ideologue who built the movement that seized power, and subsequent leaders try to emulate him.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dictator and his henchmen ====
The totalitarian dictator needs loyal lieutenants to carry out his orders faithfully and with a reasonable degree of efficiency. Friedrich and Brzezinski identify parallels between the men in Hitler and Stalin’s entourage, arguing that both dictators used similar people to perform similar tasks. Thus, for example, [[Martin Bormann]] and [[Georgy Malenkov]] were both capable administrators and bureaucrats, while [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Lavrentiy Beria]] were ruthless secret police chiefs responsible for suppressing any potential challenge to the dictator’s power.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hitler and Stalin promoted rivalry and distrust among their lieutenants so as to ensure that none of them would become powerful enough to challenge the dictator himself.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; This is the cause of an important weakness of the totalitarian regimes: the problem of succession. Friedrich points out that neither the Nazi nor the Stalinist government ever established any official line of succession or any mechanism to decide who would replace the dictator after his death. The dictator, being the venerated “father of the people,” was regarded as irreplaceable. There could never be any heir apparent, because such an heir would have been a threat to the power of the dictator while he was alive. Thus the dictator’s inevitable death would always leave behind a major power vacuum and cause a political crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Nazi regime, since Hitler died mere days before the final defeat of Germany in the war, this never became a major issue. In the case of the USSR, Stalin’s death led to a prolonged power struggle.

====Totalitarian Party====
Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify key similarities between the Nazi and Stalinist political parties, which set them apart from other types of political parties. Both the [[Nazi Party]] and the [[CPSU]] under Stalin had very strict membership requirements and did not accept members on the basis of mere agreement with the Party’s ideology and goals. Rather, they strictly tested potential members, in a manner similar to exclusive clubs, and often engaged in political [[purge]]s of the membership, expelling large numbers of people from their ranks (and sometimes arresting and executing those expelled, such as in the [[Great Purge]] or the [[Night of the Long Knives]]).&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the totalitarian party cultivates the idea that to be a member is a privilege which needs to be earned, and total obedience to the leader is required in order to maintain this privilege. While both Nazism and Stalinism required party members to display such total loyalty in practice, they differed in the way they dealt with it in theory. Nazism openly proclaimed the hierarchical ideal of absolute obedience to the [[Führer]] as one of its key ideological principles (the ''[[Führerprinzip]]''). Stalinism, meanwhile, denied that it did anything similar, and claimed instead to uphold democratic principles, with the Party Congress (made up of elected delegates) supposedly being the highest authority.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Stalinist elections typically featured only a single candidate, and the Party Congress met very rarely and simply approved Stalin’s decisions. Thus, regardless of the differences in their underlying ideological claims, the Nazi and Stalinist parties were organized in practice along similar lines, with a rigid hierarchy and centralized leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Each totalitarian party and dictator is supported by a specific totalitarian ideology. Friedrich and Brzezinski argue, in agreement with Arendt, that Nazi and Stalinist leaders really believed in their respective ideologies and did not merely use them as tools to gain power. Several major policies, such as the [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Stalinist collectivization of agriculture]] or the [[Final Solution |Nazi “final solution”]], cannot be explained by anything other than a genuine commitment to achieve ideological goals, even at great cost.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The ideologies were different and their goals were different, but what they had in common was a [[utopian]] commitment to reshaping the world, and a determination to fight by any means necessary against a real or imagined enemy.  This stereotyped enemy could be described as “the fat rich Jew or the Jewish Bolshevik” for the Nazis, or “the war-mongering, atom-bomb-wielding American Wallstreeter” for the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ideology and symbolism====
According to Friedrich and Brzezinski, the most important difference between Nazi and Stalinist ideology lies in the degree of universality involved. Stalinism, and communist ideology in general, is universal in its appeal and addresses itself to all the “[[Workers of the world, unite!|workers of the world]].” Nazism, on the other hand, and fascist ideology in general, can only address itself to one particular race or nation – the “[[master race]]” that is destined to dominate all others. Therefore, “in communism social justice appears to be the ultimate value, unless it be the classless society that is its essential condition; in fascism, the highest value is dominion, eventually world dominion, and the strong and pure nation-race is ''its'' essential condition, as seen by its ideology.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; This means that fascist or Nazi movements from different countries will be natural enemies, rather than natural allies, as they each seek to extend the dominion of their own nation at the expense of others.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski see this as a weakness inherent in fascist and Nazi ideology, while communist universalism is a source of ideological strength for Stalinism.

Friedrich and Brzezinski also draw attention to the symbols used by Nazis and Stalinists to represent themselves. The Soviet Union adopted the [[hammer and sickle]], a newly-created symbol, “invented by the leaders of the movement and pointing to the future.” Meanwhile, Nazi Germany used the [[swastika]], “a ritual symbol of uncertain origin, quite common in primitive societies.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, one is trying to project itself as being oriented towards a radically new future, while the other is appealing to a mythical heroic past.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Propaganda and terror====
Totalitarian dictatorships maintain themselves in power through the use of propaganda and terror, which Friedrich and Brzezinski believe to be closely connected. Terror may be enforced with arrests and executions of dissenters, but it can also take more subtle forms, such as the threat of losing one’s job, social stigma and defamation. “Terror” can refer to any widespread method used to intimidate people into submission as a matter of daily life. According to Friedrich and Brzezinski, the most effective terror is invisible to the people it affects. They simply develop a habit of acting in a conformist manner and not questioning authority, without necessarily being aware that this is what they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, terror creates a society dominated by apparent consensus, where the vast majority of the population appears to support the government. Propaganda is then used to maintain this appearance of popular consent. &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian propaganda is one of the features that distinguishes totalitarian regimes as modern forms of government and separates them from older autocracies, since a totalitarian government holds complete control over all means of communication (not only public communication such as the mass media, but also private communication such as letters and telephone calls, which are strictly monitored).&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of propaganda were very similar in the Stalinist USSR and in Nazi Germany. Both [[Joseph Goebbels]] and Soviet propagandists sought to demonize their enemies and present a picture of a united people standing behind its leader to confront foreign threats. In both cases there was no attempt to convey complex ideological nuances to the masses, with the message being instead about a simplistic struggle between good and evil. Both Nazi and Stalinist regimes produced two very different sets of propaganda – one for internal consumption and one for potential sympathizers in other countries. And both regimes would sometimes radically change their propaganda line as they made peace with a former enemy or got into a war with a former ally.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, paradoxically, a totalitarian government’s complete control over communications renders that government highly misinformed. With no way for anyone to express criticism, the dictator has no way of knowing how much support he actually has among the general populace. With all government policies always declared successful in propaganda, officials are unable to determine what actually worked and what didn’t.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalinism and Nazism suffered from this problem, especially during the war between them. As the war turned against Germany, there was growing opposition to Hitler’s rule, including within the ranks of the military, but Hitler was never aware of this until it was too late (see: [[20 July plot]]). In 1948, during the early days of the [[Berlin Blockade]], the Soviet leadership apparently believed that the population of [[West Berlin]] was sympathetic to Soviet Communism and that they would request to join the Soviet zone.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt; Given enough time, the gap between real public opinion and what the totalitarian government believes about public opinion can grow so wide that the government is no longer able to even produce effective propaganda, because it does not know what the people actually think and so it does not know what to tell them. Friedrich and Brzezinski refer to this as the “ritualization of propaganda”: the totalitarian regime continues to produce propaganda as a political ritual, with little real impact on public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arrests, executions and concentration camps====
The totalitarian use of mass arrests, executions and concentration camps – also noted by Arendt – was analyzed at length by Friedrich and Brzezinski. They hold that “totalitarian terror maintains, in institutionalized form, the civil war that originally produced the totalitarian movement and by means of which the regime is able to proceed with its program, first of social disintegration and then of social reconstruction.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalinism and Nazism saw themselves as engaging in a life-or-death struggle against implacable enemies. But to declare that the struggle had been won would have meant to declare that most of the totalitarian features of the government were no longer needed. A secret police force, for instance, has no reason to exist if there are no dangerous traitors who need to be found. Thus the struggle, or “civil war” against internal enemies, must be institutionalized and must continue indefinitely. In the Stalinist USSR, the repressive apparatus was eventually turned against members of the Communist Party itself in the Great Purge and the [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] that accompanied it. &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 187, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Nazism, by contrast, had a much shorter lifespan in power, and Nazi terror generally maintained an outward focus, with the extermination of the Jews always given top priority. The Nazis did not turn inward towards purging their own party except in a limited way on two occasions (the Night of the Long Knives and the aftermath of the 20 July plot). &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak of totalitarian terror was reached with the [[Nazi concentration camps]]. These ranged from [[labor camp]]s to [[extermination camp]]s, and they are described by Friedrich and Brzezinski as aiming to “eliminate all actual, potential, and imagined enemies of the regime.” &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; As the field of [[Holocaust studies]] was still in its early stages at the time of their writing, they do not describe the conditions in detail, but do refer to the camps as involving “extreme viciousness.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; They also compare these camps with the Soviet [[Gulag]] system, and highlight the use of concentration camps as a method of punishment and execution by Nazi and Stalinist regimes alike. However, unlike Hannah Arendt, who held that the Gulag camps served no economic purpose, Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that they provided an important source of cheap labor for the Stalinist economy.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moshe Lewin and Ian Kershaw==
[[File:Ian Kershaw 2012 crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ian Kershaw]] in 2012]]

===Germany and Russia===
The comparative study of Nazism and Stalinism was carried further by other groups of scholars, such as [[Moshe Lewin]] and [[Ian Kershaw]] together with their collaborators. Writing after the [[dissolution of the USSR]], Lewin and Kershaw take a longer historical perspective and regard Nazism and Stalinism not so much as examples of a new type of society (like Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski did), but more as historical “anomalies” – unusual deviations from the typical path of development that most industrial societies are expected to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the task of comparing Nazism and Stalinism is, to them, a task of explaining why Germany and Russia (along with other countries) deviated from the historical norm. At the outset, Lewin and Kershaw identify similarities between the historical situations in Germany and Russia prior to the First World War and during that war. Both countries were ruled by authoritarian monarchies, who were under pressure to make concessions to popular demands. Both countries had “powerful bureaucracies and strong military traditions.” Both had “powerful landowning classes,” while also being in the process of rapid industrialization and modernization. And both countries had expansionist foreign policies with a particular interest in Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Lewin and Kershaw do not claim that these factors made Stalinism or Nazism inevitable, but rather that they help to explain why the Stalinist and Nazi regimes developed similar features.

===Similarities and differences of the systems===
Ian Kershaw  admitted that Stalinism and Nazism are comparable in “the nature and extent of their inhumanity,” but noted that the two regimes were different in a number of aspects&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt; Lewin and Kershaw question the usefulness of grouping the Stalinist and Nazi regimes together under a “totalitarian” category, saying that it remains an open question whether the similarities between them are greater or smaller than the differences.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they criticize what they see as the ideologically-motivated attempt to determine which regime killed more people, saying that apologists of each regime are trying to defend their side by claiming the other was responsible for more deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personality cult====
Lewin and Kershaw place the [[cult of personality]] at the center of their comparison of Nazism and Stalinism, writing that both regimes “represented a new genre of political system centred upon the artificial construct of a leadership cult – the ‘heroic myth’ of the ‘great leader’, no longer a king or emperor but a ‘man of the people.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to Stalinism, they emphasize its bureaucratic character, and its “merging of the most modern with the most archaic traits” by combining modern technology and the latest methods of administration and propaganda with the ancient practice of arbitrary rule by a single man.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; They compare this with the [[Prussia]]n military tradition in Germany, which had been called “bureaucratic absolutism” in the eighteenth century, and which played a significant role in the organization of the Nazi state in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Kershaw agrees with Mommsen that there was a fundamental difference between Nazism and Stalinism regarding the importance of the leader. Stalinism had an absolute leader, but he was not essential. He could be replaced by another. Nazism, on the other hand, was a “classic charismatic leadership movement,” defined entirely by its leader. Stalinism had an ideology which existed independently of Stalin. But for Nazism, “Hitler ''was'' ideological orthodoxy” – Nazi ideals were by definition whatever Hitler said they were. In Stalinism, the bureaucratic apparatus was the foundation of the system, while in Nazism, the person of the leader was the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Moshe Lewin also focuses on the comparison between the personality cults of Hitler and Stalin, and their respective roles in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. He refers to them as the “Hitler myth” and the “Stalin myth,” and argues that they served different functions within their two regimes. The function of the “Hitler myth” was to legitimize Nazi rule. The function of the “Stalin myth” was to legitimize not Soviet rule itself, but Stalin’s leadership within the Party. Stalin’s personality cult existed precisely because Stalin knew that he was replaceable, and feared that he might be replaced, and so needed to bolster his authority as much as possible. While the “Hitler myth” was essential to Nazi Germany, the “Stalin myth” was essential only to Stalin, not to the Soviet Union itself.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intrinsic instability of totalitarian systems====
Together with fellow historian [[Hans Mommsen]], Lewin argues that the Stalinist and Nazi regimes featured an “intrinsic structural contradiction” which led to “inherent self-destructiveness”: they depended on a highly organized state bureaucracy which was trying to set up complex rules and procedures for every aspect of life, yet this bureaucracy was under the complete personal control of a despot who made policy decisions as he saw fit, routinely changing his mind on major issues, without any regard for the rules and institutions which his own bureaucracy had set up.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The bureaucracy and the leader needed each other, but also undermined each other with their different priorities. Mommsen sees this as being a much greater problem in Nazi Germany than in Stalin’s Soviet Union, as the Nazis inherited large parts of the traditional German bureaucracy, while the Soviets largely built their own bureaucracy from the ground up.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that many of the irrational features of the Nazi regime – such as wasting resources on exterminating undesirable populations instead of using those resources in the war effort – were caused by the dysfunction of the Nazi state rather than by fanatical commitment to Nazi ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the [[Führerprinzip]], all decisional power in the Nazi state ultimately rested with Hitler. But Hitler often issued only vague and general directives, forcing other Nazi leaders lower down in the hierarchy to guess what precisely the Führer wanted. This confusion produced competition between Nazi officials, as each of them attempted to prove that he was a more dedicated Nazi than his rivals, by engaging in ever more extreme policies. This competition to please Hitler was, according to Mommsen, the real cause of Nazi irrationality.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was aware of it, and deliberately encouraged it out of a “social-darwinist conviction that the best man would ultimately prevail.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen argues that this represents a structural difference between the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. In spite of its purges, Stalin’s regime was more effective in building a stable bureaucracy, such that it was possible for the system to sustain itself and continue even without Stalin. The Nazi regime, on the other hand, was much more personalized and depended entirely on Hitler, being unable to build any lasting institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 85-87&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stalin and Hitler====
Kershaw also saw  major personal differences between Stalin and Hitler and their respective styles of rule. He describes Stalin as “a committee man, chief oligarch, man of the machine” and a “creature of his party,” who came to power only thanks to his party and his ability to manipulate the levers of power within that party.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler, by contrast, came to power based on his charisma and mass appeal, and in the Nazi regime it was the leader that created the party instead of the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kershaw, “Stalin was a highly interventionist dictator, sending a stream of letters and directives determining or interfering with policy,” while Hitler “was a non-interventionist dictator as far as government administration was concerned,” preferring to involve himself in military affairs and plans for conquest rather than the daily routine of government work, and giving only broad verbal instructions to his subordinates regarding civilian affairs, which they were expected to translate into policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although both regimes featured all-pervasive cults of personality, there was a qualitative difference between those cults. Stalin’s personality cult was “superimposed upon the Marxist-Leninist ideology and Communist Party,” and could be abandoned (or replaced with a personality cult around some other leader) without major changes to the regime. On the other hand, “the ‘Hitler myth’ was structurally indispensable to, in fact the very basis of, and scarcely distinguishable from, the Nazi Movement and its ''Weltanschauung''.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in the person of Adolf Hitler as the unique savior of the German nation was the very foundation of Nazism, to such an extent that Nazism found it impossible to even imagine a successor to Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in Kershaw’s analysis, Stalinism was a fundamentally bureaucratic system while Nazism was the embodiment of “charismatic authority” as described by [[Max Weber]]. Stalinism could exist without its leader. Nazism could not. &lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rousso, Werth, and Burrin ==
[[File:Nicolas Werth 04-2012.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Werth in 2012]]
The topic of comparisons between Nazism and Stalinism was also studied in the 1990s and 2000s by historians [[Henry Rousso]], [[Nicolas Werth]] and Philippe Burrin.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===The differences between Stalinism and Nazism===
Rousso defends the work of Carl Friedrich by pointing out that Friedrich himself had only said that Stalinism and Nazism were comparable, not that they were identical. Rousso also argues that the popularity of the concept of totalitarianism (the way that large numbers of people have come to routinely refer to certain governments as “totalitarian”) should be seen as evidence that the concept is useful, that it really describes a specific type of government which is different from other dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, Rousso notes that the concept of totalitarianism is descriptive rather than analytical: the regimes described as totalitarian do not have a common origin and did not arise in similar ways. Nazism is unique among totalitarian regimes in having taken power in “a country endowed with an advanced industrial economy and with a system of political democracy (and an even older political pluralism).” All other examples of totalitarianism (including the Stalinist regime) took power, according to Rousso, “in an agrarian economy, in a poor society without a tradition of political pluralism, not to mention democracy, and where diverse forms of tyranny had traditionally prevailed.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He sees this as a weakness of the concept of totalitarianism, because it merely describes the similarities between Stalinism and Nazism without dealing with the very different ways they came to power.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Rousso agrees with Hannah Arendt that “totalitarian regimes constitute something new in regard to classical tyranny, authoritarian regimes, or other forms of ancient and medieval dictatorships,” and he says that the main strength of the concept of totalitarianism is the way it highlights this inherent novelty of the regimes involved.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict between the dictator and bureaucracy===
Nicolas Werth and Philippe Burrin have worked together on comparative assessments of Stalinism and Nazism, with Werth covering the Stalinist regime and Burrin covering Nazi Germany. One of the topics they have studied is the question of how much power the dictator really held in the two regimes. Werth identifies two main [[historiography|historiographical]] approaches in the study of the Stalinist regime: Those who emphasize the power and control exercised by Joseph Stalin himself, attributing most of the actions of the Soviet government to deliberate plans and decisions made by him, and those who argue that Stalin had no pre-determined course of action in mind, that he was reacting to events as they unfolded, and that the Soviet bureaucracy had its own agenda which often differed from Stalin’s wishes.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Werth regards these as two mistaken extremes, one making Stalin seem all-powerful, the other making him seem like a weak dictator.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; But he believes that the competing perspectives are useful in drawing attention to the tension between two different forms of organization in the Stalinist USSR: an “administrative system of command,” bureaucratic and resistant to change but effective in running the Soviet state, and the strategy of “running the country in a crudely despotic way by Stalin and his small cadre of directors.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Werth agrees with Lewin that there was an inherent conflict between the priorities of the Soviet bureaucracy and Stalin’s accumulation of absolute power in his own hands. According to Werth, it was this unresolved and unstated conflict that led to the Great Purge and to the use of terror by Stalin’s regime against its own party and state cadres.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying similar issues with regard to the Nazi regime, Philippe Burrin draws attention to the debate between the “Intentionalist” and “Functionalist” schools of thought, which dealt with the question of whether the Nazi regime represented an extension of Hitler’s autocratic will, faithfully obeying his wishes, or whether it was an essentially chaotic and uncontrollable system that functioned on its own with little direct input from the Führer.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Like Kershaw and Lewin, Burrin says that the relationship between the leader and his party’s ideology was different in Nazism compared to Stalinism: “One can rightly state that Nazism cannot be dissociated from Hitlerism, something that is difficult to affirm for Bolshevism and Stalinism.” Unlike Stalin, who inherited an existing system with an existing ideology and presented himself as the heir to the Leninist political tradition, Hitler created both his movement and its ideology by himself, claiming to be “someone sent by Providence, a Messiah whom the German people had been expecting for centuries, even for two thousand years, as Heinrich Himmler enjoyed saying.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there could be no real conflict between the Party and the leader in Nazi Germany, because the Nazi Party’s entire reason for existence was to support and follow Hitler. However, there was a potential for division between the leader and the state bureaucracy, due to the way that Nazism came to power – as part of an alliance with traditional conservative elites, industrialists, and the army.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the USSR, Nazi Germany did not build its own state, but rather inherited the state machinery of the previous government. This provided the Nazis with an immediate supply of capable and experienced managers and military commanders, but on the other hand it also meant that the Nazi regime had to rely on the cooperation of people who had not been Nazis prior to Hitler’s rise to power, and whose loyalty was questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; It was only during the war, when Nazi Germany conquered large territories and had to create Nazi administrations for them, that brand new Nazi bureaucracies were created without any input or participation from traditional German elites. This produced a surprising difference between Nazism and Stalinism: When the Stalinist USSR conquered territory, it created smaller copies of itself and installed them as the governments of the occupied countries. When Nazi Germany conquered territory, on the other hand, it did not attempt to create copies of the German government back home. Instead, it experimented with different power structures and policies, often reflecting a “far more ample Nazification of society than what the balance of power authorized in the Reich.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of terror and violence===
Another major topic investigated by Werth and Burrin was the violence and terror employed by the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. Werth reports that the Stalinist USSR underwent an “extraordinary brutalization of the relations between state and society” for the purpose of rapid modernization and industrialization, to “gain one hundred years in one decade, and to metamorphose the country into a great industrial power.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; This transformation was accomplished at the cost of massive violence and a sociopolitical regression into what Werth calls “military-feudal exploitation.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The types of violence employed by the Stalinist regime included loss of civil rights, mass arrests, deportations of entire ethnic groups from one part of the USSR to another, forced labor in the [[Gulag]], mass executions (especially during the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1937-38), and most of all the great famine of 1932-33, known as the [[Holodomor]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; All levels of Soviet society were affected by Stalinist repression, from the top to the bottom. At the top, high-ranking members of the Communist Party were arrested and executed under the claim that they had plotted against Stalin (and in some cases they were forced to confess to imaginary crimes in [[Moscow Trials|show trials]]). At the bottom, the peasantry suffered the Holodomor famine (especially in [[Ukraine]]), and even outside of the famine years they were faced with very high grain quotas.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Werth identifies four categories of people that became the targets of Stalinist violence in the USSR. He lists them from smallest to largest. The first and smallest group consisted of many of Stalin’s former comrades-in-arms, who had participated in the revolution and were known as “[[Old Bolshevik]]s.” They were dangerous to Stalin because they had known him before his rise to power and could expose the many false claims made by his personality cult. The second group consisted of mid-level Communist Party officials, who were subject to mass arrests and executions in the late 1930s, particularly during the Great Purge. Eliminating them served a dual purpose: It helped Stalin to centralize power in the Kremlin (as opposed to regional centers), and it also provided him with “corrupt officials” that he could blame for earlier repressions and unpopular policies. Werth draws parallels between this and the old [[Tsarist]] tradition of blaming “bad bureaucrats” – rather than the [[Tsar]] – for unpopular government actions.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The third group was made up of ordinary citizens from all walks of life who resorted to petty crime in order to provide for themselves in the face of worsening living standards (for example by taking home some wheat from the fields or tools from the factory). This type of petty crime became very widespread, and was often punished as if it were intentional sabotage motivated by political opposition to the USSR. The fourth and largest category consisted of ethnic groups that were subject to deportation, famine, or arbitrary arrests under the suspicion of being collectively disloyal to Stalin or to the Soviet state. This included the Holodomor famine directed at the [[Ukrainians]], the deportation of ethnic groups suspected of pro-German sympathies (such as the [[Volga Germans]], the [[Crimean Tatars]], the [[Chechens]] and others), and eventually also persecution of ethnic [[Jews]], especially as [[Stalin and antisemitism|Stalin grew increasingly antisemitic]] near the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Burrin’s study of violence carried out by the Nazi regime begins with the observation that “violence is at the heart of Nazism,” and that Nazi violence is “established as a doctrine and exalted in speech.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a point of difference between Nazism and Stalinism, according to Burrin. In Stalinism, there was a gulf between ideology and reality when it came to violence. The Soviet regime continuously denied that it was repressive, proclaimed itself a defender of peace, and sought to conceal all the evidence to the contrary. In Nazism, on the other hand, “doctrine and reality were fused from the start.” Nazism not only practiced violent repression and war, but advocated it in principle as well, considering war to be a positive force in human civilization and openly seeking [[lebensraum|”living space”]] and the domination of the European continent by ethnic Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Burrin identifies three motivations for Nazi violence: political repression, exclusion and social repression, and racial politics.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these, political repression, is common in many dictatorships. The Nazis aimed to eliminate their real or imagined political opponents, first in the Reich and later in the occupied territories during the war. Some of these opponents were executed, while others were imprisoned in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. The first targets of political repression, immediately after Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, were the parties of the Left in general and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Then, after the mid-1930s, repression was extended to members of the clergy, and later to the conservative opposition as well (especially after the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler in 1944). The death penalty was used on a wide scale, even before the war. During the war, political repression was greatly expanded both inside Germany and especially in the newly occupied territories. Political prisoners in the concentration camps numbered only about 25,000 at the beginning of the war. By January 1945 they had swelled to 714,211 – most of them non-Germans accused of plotting against the Reich.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of Nazi violence, motivated by exclusion and social repression, was the violence aimed at purging German society of people whose lifestyle was considered incompatible with the social norms of the Nazi regime (even if the people involved were racially pure and able-bodied). Such people were divided into two categories: [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and “asocials.” The “asocials” were only vaguely defined, and included “Gypsies, tramps, beggars, prostitutes, alcoholics, the jobless who refused any employment, and those who left their work frequently or for no reason.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and final type of Nazi violence, by far the most extensive, was violence motivated by [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial policies]]. This was aimed both inward, to cleanse the “Aryan race” of “degenerate” elements and [[life unworthy of life]], as well as outward, to seek the extermination of [[Untermensch|“inferior races”]]. Germans considered physically or mentally unfit were among the first victims. One of the first laws of the Nazi regime mandated the forced sterilization of people suffering from physical handicaps or who had psychiatric conditions deemed to be hereditary. Later, sterilization was replaced by murder of the mentally ill and of people with severe disabilities, as part of a “euthanasia” program called [[Aktion T4]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Burrin notes that this served no practical political purpose – the people being murdered could not have possibly been political opponents of the regime – so the motivation was purely a matter of racial ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; The most systematic and by far the most large-scale acts of Nazi violence, however, were directed at “racially inferior” non-German populations. As laid out in ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'', the Nazis wished to eliminate most of the [[Slavs|Slavic]] populations of Eastern Europe, partly through deportation and partly through murder, in order to secure land for ethnic German settlement and colonization.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; But even more urgently, the Nazis wished to exterminate the [[Jews]] of Europe, whom they regarded as the implacable racial enemy of the Germans. This culminated in the [[Holocaust]], the Nazi [[genocide]] of the Jews. Unlike in the case of all other target populations, the Jews were to be exterminated completely, with no individual exceptions for any reason.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geyer and Fitzpatrick ==
In ''Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared'', editors [[Michael Geyer]] and [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]] disputed the concept of totalitarianism, noting that the term entered political discourse first as a term of self-description by the Italian Fascists and was only later used as a framework to compare Nazi Germany with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the totalitarian states were not as monolithic or as ideology-driven as they seemed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Geyer and Fitzpatrick describe Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR as “immensely powerful, threatening, and contagious dictatorships” who “shook the world in their antagonism.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Without calling them totalitarian, they identified their common features, including genocide, an all-powerful party, a charismatic leader, and pervasive invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; However, they argue that Stalinism and Nazism did not represent a new and unique type of government, but rather that they can be placed in the broader context of the turn to dictatorship in Europe in the interwar period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The reason they appear extraordinary is because they were the “most prominent, most hard-headed, and most violent” of the European dictatorships of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; They are comparable because of their “shock and awe” and sheer ruthlessness, but underneath superficial similarities they were fundamentally different and that “when it comes to one-on-one comparison, the two societies and regimes may as well have hailed from different worlds.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Geyer and Fitzpatrick, the similarities between Nazism and Stalinism stem from the fact that they were both “ideology driven” and sought to subordinate all aspects of life to their respective ideologies. The differences stem from the fact that their ideologies were opposed to each other and regarded each other as enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Another major difference is that Stalin created a stable and long-lasting regime, while Nazi Germany had a “short-lived, explosive nature.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the stable state created by Stalinism was based on an entirely new elite, while Nazism, despite having the support of the traditional elite, failed to achieve stability.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the two regimes did borrow ideas from one another, especially regarding propaganda techniques (most of all in architecture and cinema), but also in terms of state surveillance and antisemitism. At the same time, they both vigorously denied borrowing anything from each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; While their methods of propaganda were similar, the content was different. For instance, Soviet wartime propaganda revolved around the idea of resisting imperial aggression, while Nazi propaganda was about wars of racial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Geyer and Fitzpatrick also take note of the fact that both Stalinism and Nazism sought to create a New Man, an “entirely modern, illiberal, and self-fashioned personage,” even though they had different visions about what being a “New Man” would mean.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopolitics, eugenics and social engineering===
Among the other authors contributing to the volume edited by Geyer and Fitzpatrick, David Hoffmann and Annette Timm discuss [[biopolitics]] and the pro-natalist policies of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes. Both governments were highly concerned over low fertility rates in their respective populations, and applied extensive and intrusive [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] techniques to increase the number of births.&lt;ref name="Geyer9"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 83-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive policies in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were administered through their health care systems—both regimes saw health care as a key pillar to their designs to develop a new society.&lt;ref name="Geyer11a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Soviet Union had to design a public health care system from scratch, Nazi Germany built upon the pre-existing public health care system in Germany that had existed since 1883, when [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s legislation had created the world's first national public health care program.&lt;ref name="Geyer11a"/&gt; The Nazis centralized the German health care system in order to enforce Nazi ideological components upon it, and replaced existing voluntary and government welfare agencies with new ones that were devoted to racial hygiene and other components of Nazi ideology.&lt;ref name="Geyer11"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi and Stalinist attempt to control family size was not unique, as many other European states practiced [[eugenics]] at this time, and the Stalinist and Nazi ideals were vastly different.&lt;ref name="Geyer6"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, they had more in common with third parties than with each other: Nazi Germany’s policies were rather similar to those in Scandinavia at the time, while the USSR’s policies resembled those in Catholic countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;The common point between Nazi and Stalinist practices was the connection of reproduction policies with the ideological goals of the state — "part of the project of a rational, hypermodern vision for the re-organization of society".&lt;ref name="Geyer7"&gt;[[Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; There were nevertheless substantial differences between the two regimes' approaches. Stalin's Soviet Union never officially supported eugenics as the Nazis did—the Soviet government called eugenics a "fascist science"—although there were in fact Soviet eugenicists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/connections/54ece589642e09bce5000001|title=Russia (former USSR)|work=The Eugenics Archives|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two regimes also had different approaches to the relationship between family and paid labor—Nazism promoted the male single-breadwinner family while Stalinism promoted the dual-wage-earner household.&lt;ref name="Geyer8"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass violence, xenophobia and persecution of ethnic minorities===
In another contribution to the same volume, Christian Gerlach and Nicolas Werth discuss the topic of mass violence, and the way that it was used by both Stalinism and Nazism.&lt;ref name="Geyer13"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalin's Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were violent societies where mass violence was accepted by the state, such as in the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1937 to 1938 in the Soviet Union and [[the Holocaust]] in Nazi Germany and its occupied territories in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Geyer15"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. Pp. 135, 139-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Stalinist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany utilized internment camps led by agents of the state – the NKVD in the Soviet Union and the SS in Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Geyer13" /&gt; They also both engaged in violence against minorities based on [[xenophobia]] – the xenophobic violence of the Nazis was outspoken but rationalized as being against "asocial" elements while the xenophobic violence of the Stalinists was disguised as being against "anti-soviet", "[[counter-revolutionary]]" and "socially harmful" elements – a term which often targeted diaspora nationalities.&lt;ref name="Geyer14"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stalinist Soviet Union established "special settlements" where the "socially harmful" or "socially dangerous" who included ex-convicts, criminals, vagrants, the disenfranchised and "declassed elements" were expelled to.&lt;ref name="Geyer15a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. Pp. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; These "special settlements" were largely in Siberia, the far north, the Urals, or other inhospitable territories.&lt;ref name="Geyer16"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1933, the Soviet Union made a mass arrest of 5000 [[Romani people]] effectively on the basis of their ethnicity, who were deported that month to the "special settlements" in Western Siberia.&lt;ref name="Geyer16" /&gt; In 1935, the Soviet Union arrested 160,000 homeless people and juvenile delinquents and sent many of them to NKVD labor colonies where they did [[forced labor]].&lt;ref name="Geyer17"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi regime was founded upon a racialist view of politics and envisioned the deportation or extermination of the majority of the population of Eastern Europe in order to open up “living space” for ethnic German settlers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; This was mainly intended to be carried out after an eventual German victory in the war, but steps had already started being taken while the war was still ongoing. For instance, by the end of 1942, the Nazis had deported 365,000 Poles and Jews from their original homes in western Poland (now German-annexed) and into the [[General Government]]. A further 194,000 Poles were internally displaced (not deported to another territory but expelled from their homes). The Nazis had also deported 100,000 persons from Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg, as well as 54,000 Slovenians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalinism in practice in the Soviet Union pursued ethnic deportations from the 1930s to the early 1950s, with a total of 3 million Soviet citizens being subjected to ethnic-based resettlement.&lt;ref name="Geyer17a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major ethnic deportation took place from December 1932 to January 1933, during which some 60,000 Kuban Cossacks were collectively criminally charged as a whole with association with resistance to socialism and affiliation with Ukrainian nationalism.&lt;ref name="Geyer18"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1935 to 1936, the Soviet Union deported Soviet citizens of Polish and German origins living in the western districts of Ukraine, and Soviet citizens of Finnish origins living on the Finland-Soviet Union border.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; These deportations from 1935 to 1936 affected tens of thousands of families.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; From September to October 1937, Soviet authorities deported the Korean minority from its Far Eastern region that bordered on Japanese-controlled Korea.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; Soviet authorities claimed the territory was "rich soil for the Japanese to till" – implying a Soviet suspicion that the Koreans could potentially join forces with the Japanese to unite the land with Japanese-held Korea.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; Over 170,000 Koreans were deported to remote parts of Soviet Central Asia from September to October 1937. These ethnically-based deportations reflected a new trend in Stalinist policy, a "Soviet xenophobia" based on ideological grounds that suspected that these people were susceptible to foreign influence, and which was also based on a resurgent [[Russian nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt;

After Nazi Germany declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941, the Soviet Union initiated another major round of ethnic deportations. The first group targeted were Soviet Germans. Between September 1941 and February 1942, 900,000 people – over 70 percent of the entire Soviet German community – were deported to Kazakhstan and Siberia in mass operations.&lt;ref name="Geyer19"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave of mass deportations took place between November 1943 and May 1944, in which Soviet authorities expelled six ethnic groups (the [[Balkars]], [[Chechens]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]], [[Karachai]], and [[Kalmyks]]) that together numbered 900,000.&lt;ref name="Geyer20"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also smaller-scale operations involving ethnic cleansing of diaspora minorities during and after World War II, in which tens of thousands of Crimean Bulgarians, Greeks, Iranians, Khemshils, Kurds, and Meskhetian Turks were deported from the Black Sea and Transcaucasian border regions.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt;

Two ethnic groups that were specifically targeted for persecution by Stalin's Soviet Union were the Chechens and the Ingush.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; Unlike the other nationalities that could be suspected of connection to foreign states which shared their ethnic background, the Chechens and the Ingush were completely indigenous people of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; Rather than being accused of collaboration with foreign enemies, these two ethnic groups were considered to have cultures which did not fit in with Soviet culture – such as accusing Chechens of being associated with “banditism” – and the authorities claimed that the Soviet Union had to intervene in order to “remake” and “reform” these cultures.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; In practice this meant heavily armed punitive operations carried out against Chechen “bandits” that failed to achieve forced assimilation, culminating in an ethnic cleansing operation in 1944, which involved the arrests and deportation of over 500,000 Chechens and Ingush from the [[Caucasus]] to [[Central Asia]] and [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name="Geyer21"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; The deportations of the Chechens and Ingush also involved the outright massacre of thousands of people, and severe conditions placed upon the deportees – they were put in unsealed train cars, with little to no food for a four-week journey during which many died from hunger and exhaustion.&lt;ref name="Geyer22"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between Nazi and Stalinist deportations was in their purpose: while Nazi Germany sought ethnic cleansing to allow settlement by Germans into the cleansed territory, Stalin's Soviet Union pursued ethnic cleansing in order to remove minorities from strategically important areas.&lt;ref name="Geyer23"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Payne]], in his work on fascism, said that although the Nazi Party was ideologically opposed to communism, Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders frequently expressed recognition that only in Soviet Russia were their revolutionary and ideological counterparts to be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Payne|title=Fascism: Comparison and Definition|date=15 March 1983|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299080648|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both placed a major emphasis on creating a "party-army," with the regular armed forces controlled by the party. In the case of the Soviet Union this was done through the [[political commissar]]s, while Nazi Germany introduced a roughly equivalent leadership role for "National Socialist Guidance Officers" in 1943.&lt;ref name="Payne1"&gt;[[#Payne1983|Payne (1983)]]. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Furet]], in his work on communism, noted that Hitler personally admired Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, and on numerous occasions publicly praised Stalin for seeking to purify the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of Jewish influences, especially by purging Jewish communists such as [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Karl Radek]].&lt;ref name="François Furet 1999. Pp. 191-192"&gt;François Furet. ''Passing of an Illusion: The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century''. University of Chicago Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-226-27340-7}}. Pp. 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Pipes]] draws attention to [[Stalin and antisemitism|Stalin and his antisemitism]] in a parallel with [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi antisemitism]]. He notes that soon after the 1917 October Revolution, the Soviet Union undertook practices to break up Jewish culture, religion and language. In the fall of 1918, the Soviet Communist Party set up the Jewish section [[Yevsektsiya]], with a stated mission of “destruction of traditional Jewish life, the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement, and Hebrew culture.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]], "Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime", New York: NY, Vintage Books, Random House Inc., 1995, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; By 1919, the Bolsheviks  began to confiscate Jewish properties, Hebrew schools, libraries, books, and synagogues in accordance with newly imposed anti-religious laws, turning their buildings into "Communist centers, clubs or restaurants."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, "Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime", New York: NY, Vintage Books, Random House Inc., 1995, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; After Joseph Stalin rose to power, antisemitism continued to be endemic throughout Russia, although official Soviet policy condemned it. On August 12, 1952, Stalin's personal antisemitism became more visible, as he ordered the execution of the most prominent Yiddish authors in the Soviet Union, in an event known as the "[[Night of the Murdered Poets]]". Shortly before his death, Stalin also organized the anti-Semitic campaign known as the [[Doctors' plot]].

A number of research institutions are focusing on the analysis of fascism/Nazism and Stalinism/communism, and the comparative approach, including the [[Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism]] in Germany, the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] in the Czech Republic and the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] in Poland.

In comparing the deaths caused by both Stalin and Hitler's policies, some historians have asserted that archival evidence released after the collapse of the USSR confirms that Stalin did not kill more people than Hitler. American historian [[Timothy D. Snyder]], for example, after assessing such data, says that while the Nazi regime killed approximately 11 million non-combatants (which rises to above 12 million if "foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included"), Stalin's deliberately killed about 6 million (rising to 9 million if foreseeable deaths arising from policies are taken into account).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|title=Hitler vs. Stalin: Who Was Worse?|website=The New York Review of Books|date=27 January 2011|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2011/01/27/hitler-vs-stalin-who-was-worse/|accessdate=25 May 2018|quote=" The total number of noncombatants killed by the Germans—about 11 million—is roughly what we had thought. The total number of civilians killed by the Soviets, however, is considerably less than we had believed. We know now that the Germans killed more people than the Soviets did . . . All in all, the Germans deliberately killed about 11 million noncombatants, a figure that rises to more than 12 million if foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included. For the Soviets during the Stalin period, the analogous figures are approximately six million and nine million. These figures are of course subject to revision, but it is very unlikely that the consensus will change again as radically as it has since the opening of Eastern European archives in the 1990s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian historian and archival researcher [[Stephen G. Wheatcroft]] posits that "The Stalinist regime was consequently responsible for about a million purposive killings, and through its criminal neglect and irresponsibility it was probably responsible for the premature deaths of about another two million more victims amongst the repressed population, i.e. in the camps, colonies, prisons, exile, in transit and in the POW camps for Germans. These are clearly much lower figures than those for whom Hitler's regime was responsible." Wheatcroft also says that, unlike Hitler, Stalin's "purposive killings" fit more closely into the category of "execution" than "murder", given he thought the accused were indeed guilty of crimes against the state and insisted on documentation, whereas Hitler simply wanted to kill Jews and communists because of who they were, and insisted on no documentation and was indifferent at even a pretence of legality for these actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/WCR-German_Soviet.pdf|title=The Scale and Nature of German and Soviet Repression and Mass Killings, 1930–45|last=Wheatcroft|first=S.

[[Kristen R. Ghodsee]], an ethnographer of post-Cold War Eastern Europe, contends that the efforts to institutionalize the "double genocide thesis", or the moral equivalence between the Nazi Holocaust (race murder) and the victims of communism (class murder), and in particular the recent push at the beginning of the global financial crisis for commemoration of the latter in Europe, can be seen as the response by economic and political elites to fears of a leftist resurgence in the face of devastated economies and extreme inequalities in both the East and West as the result of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] capitalism. She notes that any discussion of the achievements under communism, including literacy, education, women’s rights, and social security is usually silenced, and any discourse on the subject of communism is focused almost exclusively on Stalin's crimes and the "double genocide thesis", an intellectual paradigm summed up as such: "1) any move towards redistribution and away from a completely free market is seen as communist; 2) anything communist inevitably leads to class murder; and 3) class murder is the moral equivalent of the Holocaust." By linking all leftist and socialist ideals to the excesses of Stalinism, Ghodsee concludes, the elites in the West hope to discredit and marginalize all political ideologies that could "threaten the primacy of private property and free markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Ghodsee|first1=Kristen R.|volume = 4| issue = 2| pages = 115–142|title = A Tale of "Two Totalitarianisms": The Crisis of Capitalism and the Historical Memory of Communism| journal = History of the Present| date = 2014|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kristenghodsee/files/history_of_the_present_galleys.pdf | jstor = 10.5406/historypresent.4.2.0115|authorlink=Kristen R.

The comparison of Nazism and Stalinism has long provoked political controversy,&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian; Moshé Lewin"&gt;Kershaw pp3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleck&gt;{{cite book|last=Fleck |first=Christian|title=Intellectuals and their publics: perspectives from the social sciences|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-7540-2|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it led to [[Historikerstreit|the historians' dispute]] within Germany in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Lévy, Daniel. Sznaider, Natan"&gt;Lévy pp76&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), under the leadership of Chancellor [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]], adopted the view that "red equals brown", i.e. that the communists and Nazis posed an equal danger to [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelheid von Saldern, ''The Challenge of Modernity: German Social and Cultural Studies, 1890-1960'', University of Michigan Press (2002), {{ISBN|0-472-10986-3}}, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, [[Kurt Schumacher]] said that the two movements enabled each other. He argued that the [[Communist Party of Germany]], which was staunchly Stalinist, were "red-painted Nazis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lasten diktatorischer Vergangenheit, Herausforderungen demokratischer Gegenwart |last=Richter |first=Michael |editor1-first=Gerhard |editor1-last=Besier |editor2-first=Katarzyna |editor2-last=Stoklosa |series=Mittel- und Ostmitteleuropastudien |year=2006 |publisher=LIT Verlag |location=Münster |page=202 |chapter=Die doppelte Diktatur.

Marxist theories of fascism have seen fascism as a form of reaction to socialism and a feature of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Dave Renton. ''Fascism: Theory and Practice''. London: Pluto Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern historians have tried to pay more attention to the economic, political and ideological differences between these two regimes than to their similarities.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Henry Rousso. "Stalinism and Nazism. History and Memory Compared". ''Historische Zeitschrift''. 286:3, 2008. Pp. 795–796.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2008 [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism]], initiated by the [[Czech government]] and signed by figures such as [[Václav Havel]], called for "a common approach regarding crimes of totalitarian regimes, inter alia Communist regimes" and for

The [[Communist Party of Greece]] opposes the Prague Declaration and has criticized "the new escalation of the [[anti-communist]] hysteria led by the EU council, the European Commission and the political staff of the bourgeois class in the European Parliament."&lt;ref name="CommunistPartyGreece"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://inter.kke.gr/News/news2011/2011-02-03-anticom-euparliament/ |title= Statement-condemnation of the escalation of the anti-communist hysteria by the EU |date= 2011-02-03 |publisher= [[Communist Party of Greece]] |accessdate= 2011-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Communist Party of Britain]] opined that the Prague Declaration "is a rehash of the persistent attempts by reactionary historians to equate Soviet Communism and Hitlerite Fascism, echoing the old slanders of British authors [[George Orwell]] and [[Robert Conquest]]."&lt;ref name="CommunistPartyUK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://communist-party.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=742%3Acp-contribution-to-international-conference-on-prague-declaration&amp;catid=128%3Aconferences&amp;Itemid=162 |title=CP contribution to International Conference on Prague Declaration |date=13 February 2010 |publisher=[[Communist Party of Britain]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64orFpG5S?url=http://communist-party.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=742%3Acp-contribution-to-international-conference-on-prague-declaration&amp;catid=128%3Aconferences&amp;Itemid=162 |accessdate=2011-05-16 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 documentary film ''[[The Soviet Story]]'', commissioned by the [[Union for Europe of the Nations]] group in the [[European Parliament]], published archival records which listed thousands of German Jews who were arrested in the Soviet Union by the [[NKVD]] (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) from 1937 to 1941 and handed over to [[Gestapo]] or SS officials in Germany. These German Jews had originally sought asylum in the USSR. The documentary film accuses Stalin's regime of being an accomplice in Hitler's Holocaust by arresting these asylum seekers and sending them back to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''The Soviet Story'', Edvins Snore, writer/director, 85-minute documentary, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, the [[European Union]] has officially commemorated the [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]],&lt;ref name="Buzek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/view/en/press/press_release/2010/2010-August/press_release-2010-August-10.html |title=President Jerzy Buzek on the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism |publisher=[[European Parliament]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yf46Gk7v?url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/view/en/press/press_release/2010/2010-August/press_release-2010-August-10.html |archivedate=13 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; proclaimed by the [[European Parliament]] in 2008&lt;ref name="Buzek" /&gt; and endorsed by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8133749.stm|title=Resolution on Stalin riles Russia|date=3 July 2009|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and officially known as the Black Ribbon Day in some countries (including Canada).&lt;ref name="TorontoSun2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=Victims of totalitarianism remembered |author= Daniel Proussalidis |url= http://www.torontosun.com/2011/08/23/victims-of-totalitarianism-remembered |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=2011-08-23 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[President of the European Parliament]] and [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] member, [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]], argued that "both totalitarian systems (Stalinism and Nazism) are comparable and terrible."&lt;ref name="eurolt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/5537/?print=1 |title=Baltic States opened Western Europe's eyes on Soviet Union totalitarianism -- EP chairman in Vilnius |date=2009-04-28 |publisher=BNS |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722150204/http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/5537/?print=1 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Eastern Europe]]an countries the denial of both Nazi and Communist crimes has been explicitly outlawed, and Czech foreign minister [[Karel Schwarzenberg]] has argued that "there is a fundamental concern here that totalitarian systems be measured by the same standard."&lt;ref name="romea"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romea.cz/english/index.php?id=detail&amp;detail=2007_2070 |title=Czech Foreign Minister: Denial of communist crimes like denial of Nazi crimes |publisher=Romea.cz |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yf7qICc8?url=http://www.romea.cz/english/index.php?id=detail&amp;detail=2007_2070 |archivedate=14 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[European Commission]] rejected calls for similar EU-wide legislation, due to the lack of consensus among member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EU rejects eastern states' call to outlaw denial of crimes by communist regimes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/21/european-commission-communist-crimes-nazism|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 May 2011|location=London|first=Leigh |last=Phillips|date=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement adopted by Russia's legislature said that comparisons of Nazism and Stalinism are "blasphemous towards all of the anti-fascist movement veterans, Holocaust victims, concentration camp prisoners and tens of millions of people ... who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the fight against the Nazis' anti-human racial theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/politics/nuremberg-trials-ww2-russia/ |title=Russian MPs call on world to suppress attempts to revive Nazi ideology |publisher=[[RT (TV network)|RT]] |date=2010-10-24|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British journalist [[Seumas Milne]] posits that the impact of the post-Cold War narrative that Stalin and Hitler were twin evils, and therefore Communism is as monstrous as Nazism, "has been to relativise the unique crimes of Nazism, bury those of colonialism and feed the idea that any attempt at radical social change will always lead to suffering, killing and failure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/sep/12/highereducation.historyandhistoryofart Seumas Milne: The battle for history].

The '''counterculture of the 1960s''' was an [[anti-establishment]] cultural phenomenon that developed first in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) and then spread throughout much of the [[Western world]] between the mid-1960s and the mid-1970s, with London, New York City, and San Francisco being hotbeds of early countercultural activity. The aggregate movement gained momentum as the [[Civil Rights Movement]] continued to grow, and would later become revolutionary with the expansion of the U.S. government's extensive [[Vietnam War|military intervention in Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Donald Hirsch|Hirsch, E. D.]] (1993). ''The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy''. Houghton Mifflin. {{ISBN|978-0-395-65597-9}}. p. 419.

It includes the complex set of learned and shared beliefs, customs, skills, habits, traditions, and knowledge common to the members of society. Within a culture, there may be subcultures made up of specific groups that are somewhat separate from the rest of society because of distinct traits, beliefs, or interests.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1960s progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding [[human sexuality]], [[Second-wave feminism|women's rights]], traditional modes of authority, experimentation with [[psychoactive drug]]s, and differing interpretations of the [[American Dream]]. Many key movements related to these issues were born or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/POLSC301-9.1.3-Counterculture.pdf|title=Counterculture|last=|first=|date=|website=saylor|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the era unfolded, new cultural forms and a dynamic [[Zeitgeist|subculture]] which celebrated experimentation, modern incarnations of [[Bohemianism]], and the rise of the [[hippie]] and other alternative lifestyles, emerged. This embracing of creativity is particularly notable in the works of [[British Invasion]] bands such as [[The Beatles]], and filmmakers whose works became far less restricted by censorship. In addition to the trendsetting Beatles, many other creative artists, authors, and thinkers, within and across many disciplines, helped define the counterculture movement.

Several factors distinguished the counterculture of the 1960s from the [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian movements]] of previous eras.

The counterculture era essentially commenced in earnest with the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] in November 1963. It became absorbed into the [[popular culture]] with the termination of US combat military involvement in Southeast Asia and the end of the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] in 1973, and ultimately with the [[Watergate scandal#Resignation|resignation]] of President [[Richard Nixon]] in August 1974.

===Social issues and calls to action===

Many social issues fueled the growth of the larger counterculture movement. One was a nonviolent movement in the United States seeking to resolve constitutional civil rights illegalities, especially regarding general [[racial segregation]], longstanding [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement]] of blacks in the South by white-dominated state government, and ongoing racial discrimination in jobs, housing, and access to public places in both the North and the South.

Many counterculture activists became aware of the plight of the poor, and [[community organizer]]s fought for the funding of [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty program]]s, particularly in the South and within [[ghetto|inner city]] areas in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/tcn/valocchi.htm |title=The Historical Development of Community Organizing |publisher=Trincoll.edu |accessdate=July 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821210336/http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/tcn/valocchi.htm |archivedate=August 21, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Lillian|title=Our Faces, Our Words|date=1964|publisher=Norton &amp; Co.|location=New York|isbn=9780393002515|page=114|edition=First (pbk)|quote=But there is something beyond rights, something not more important but more desperately urgent: bodily need.

[[Environmentalism]] grew from a greater understanding of the ongoing damage caused by [[industrialization]], resultant [[pollution]], and the misguided use of chemicals such as [[pesticides]] in well-meaning efforts to improve the quality of life for the rapidly growing population.&lt;ref name="US Census Bureau"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/worldgrgraph.php |title=International Data Base World Population Growth Rates: 1950–2050 |publisher=US Department of Commerce |accessdate=April 18, 2014 |quote=The world population growth rate rose from about 1.5 percent per year from 1950 to 1951, to a peak of over 2 percent in the early 1960s due to reductions in mortality. Growth rates thereafter started to decline due to rising age at marriage as well as increasing availability and use of effective contraceptive methods. Note that changes in population growth have not always been steady. A dip in the growth rate from 1959 to 1960, for instance, was due to the Great Leap Forward in China. During that time, both natural disasters and decreased agricultural output in the wake of massive social reorganization caused China's death rate to rise sharply and its fertility rate to fall by almost half |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220064433/http://www.census.gov/population/international/data/idb/worldgrgraph.php |archive-date=February 20, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors such as [[Rachel Carson]] played key roles in developing a new awareness among the [[world population|global population]] of the [[Ecology|fragility of our planet]], despite resistance from elements of the establishment in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muir|first1=Patricia|title=History of Pesticide Use|url=http://people.oregonstate.edu/~muirp/pesthist.htm|website=oregonstate.edu|publisher=Oregon State College|accessdate=July 7, 2014|quote=Then, things began to temper the enthusiasm for pesticides.

She (a scientist) issued grave warnings about pesticides, and predicted massive destruction of the planet's fragile ecosystems unless more was done to halt what she called the "rain of chemicals." In retrospect, this book really launched the environmental movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need to address minority rights of women, gay people, the handicapped, and many other neglected constituencies within the larger population came to the forefront as an increasing number of primarily younger people broke free from the constraints of 1950s orthodoxy and struggled to create a more inclusive and tolerant social landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Skrentny, John (2002).

The availability of new and more effective forms of [[birth control]] was a key underpinning of the [[sexual revolution]]. The notion of "recreational sex" without the threat of unwanted pregnancy radically changed the social dynamic and permitted both women and men much greater freedom in the selection of sexual lifestyles outside the confines of traditional marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pill/ |title=American Experience &amp;#124; The Pill |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this change in attitude, by the 1990s the ratio of children born out of wedlock rose from 5% to 25% for Whites and from 25% to 66% for African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/cdewp/99-09.pdf |title=Determinants of Planned and Unplanned Childbearing among Unmarried Women in the United States |last1=Musick |first1=Kelly |date=April 1999 |website=wisconsin.edu |publisher=Center for Demography and Ecology, University of Wisconsin-Madison |accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Television====

For those born after [[World War II]], the emergence of television as a source of entertainment and information—as well as the associated massive expansion of [[consumerism]] afforded by post-war affluence and encouraged by TV [[advertising]]—were key components in creating disillusionment for some younger people and in the formulation of new social behaviours, even as [[ad agencies]] heavily courted the "hip" youth market.&lt;ref name="Frank1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Frank|title=The Conquest of Cool: Business Culture, Counterculture, and the Rise of Hip Consumerism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KHyIY2cctQIC&amp;pg=PA132|date=December 1, 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-26012-9|pages=132–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AndersonHerr2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary L.

The end of censorship resulted in a complete reformation of the western film industry. With new-found artistic freedom, a generation of exceptionally talented [[New Hollywood|New Wave]] film makers working across all genres brought realistic depictions of previously prohibited subject matter to neighborhood theater screens for the first time, even as [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] film studios were still considered a part of the establishment by some elements of the counterculture.

====New radio====
[[File:Family watching television 1958.jpg|thumb|A family watches television, {{circa|1958}}]]
By the later 1960s, previously under-regarded [[FM radio]] replaced [[AM radio]] as the focal point for the ongoing explosion of [[rock and roll]] music, and became the nexus of youth-oriented news and advertising for the counterculture generation.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling, Christopher &amp; Keith, Michael (2008).

===Changing lifestyles===

[[Commune]]s, [[collective]]s, and [[intentional communities]] regained popularity during this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flower Power|url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/57h.asp|website=ushistory.org|publisher=ushistory.org/Independence Hall Association|accessdate=July 28, 2014|date=2014|quote=Like the utopian societies of the 1840s, over 2000 rural communes formed during these turbulent times. Completely rejecting the capitalist system, many communes rotated duties, made their own laws, and elected their own leaders. Some were philosophically based, but others were influenced by new religions. Earth-centered religions, astrological beliefs, and Eastern faiths proliferated across American campuses. Some scholars labeled this trend as the Third Great Awakening.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early communities, such as the [[Hog Farm]], [[Quarry Hill Creative Center|Quarry Hill]], and [[Drop City]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2616390/One-Americas-hippies-dies-94-founding-infamous-retreat.html |title=One of America's first 'hippies' dies at 94 after founding famous Vermont retreat

in the US were established as straightforward [[back to the land movement|agrarian]] attempts to return to the land and live free of interference from outside influences. As the era progressed, many people established and populated new communities in response to not only disillusionment with standard community forms, but also dissatisfaction with certain elements of the counterculture itself. Some of these self-sustaining communities have been credited with the birth and propagation of the international [[Green Politics|Green Movement]].

The emergence of an interest in expanded spiritual consciousness, [[yoga]], [[occult]] practices and increased [[Human Potential Movement|human potential]] helped to shift views on organized religion during the era. In 1957, 69% of US residents polled by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] said religion was increasing in influence. By the late 1960s, polls indicated less than 20% still held that belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/103459/Questions-Answers-About-Americans-Religion.aspx# |title=Questions and Answers About Americans' Religion |publisher=Gallup.com |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Generation Gap]]", or the inevitable perceived divide in worldview between the old and young, was perhaps never greater than during the counterculture era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/1960s/videos/ask-steve-generation-gap#ask-steve-hippie-vs-yippie |title=Ask Steve: Generation Gap (Video)|website=history.com |publisher=History Channel/A&amp;E|quote=Explore the existence of the generation gap that took place in the 1960s through this Ask Steve video. Steve Gillon explains there was even a larger gap between the Baby Boomers themselves than the Baby Boomers and the Greatest Generation. The massive Baby Boomers Generation was born between 1946 and 1964, consisting of nearly 78 million people. The Baby Boomers were coming of age in the 1960s, and held different cultural values than the Greatest Generation. The Greatest Generation lived in a time of self-denial, while the Baby Boomers were always seeking immediate gratification. However, the Baby Boomers were more divided amongst themselves. Not all of them were considered hippies and protesters. In fact, people under the age of 28 supported the Vietnam War in greater numbers than their parents. These divisions continue to play out today. |accessdate=May 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large measure of the generational chasm of the 1960s and early 1970s was born of rapidly evolving fashion and hairstyle trends that were readily adopted by the young, but often misunderstood and ridiculed by the old.

The fashion dominance of the counterculture effectively ended with the rise of the [[Disco]] and [[Punk Rock]] eras in the later 1970s, even as the global popularity of T-shirts, denim jeans, and casual clothing in general have continued to grow.

====Emergent middle-class drug culture====
In the western world, the ongoing criminal legal status of the recreational drug industry was instrumental in the formation of an anti-establishment social dynamic by some of those coming of age during the counterculture era. The explosion of [[marijuana]] use during the era, in large part by students on fast-expanding college campuses,&lt;ref name="The Nation 1966-01-31"&gt;{{cite news |last=Freedman |first=Mervin B. |last2=Powelson |first2=Harvey |url=http://thenation.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/drugsoncampus1966.pdf |title=Drugs on Campus: Turned On &amp; Tuned Out |work=The Nation |location=New York |publisher=Nation Co.

===Law enforcement===
[[File:Vietnam War protestors at the March on the Pentagon.jpg|upright|thumb|Anti-war protesters]]
The confrontations between college students (and other activists) and law enforcement officials became one of the hallmarks of the era. Many younger people began to show deep distrust of police, and terms such as "[[List of police-related slang terms|fuzz]]" and "pig" as derogatory [[epithets]] for police reappeared, and became key words within the counterculture lexicon. The distrust of police was based not only on fear of [[police brutality]] during political protests, but also on generalized police corruption - especially police manufacture of false evidence, and outright entrapment, in drug cases. In the US, the social tension between elements of the counterculture and law enforcement reached the breaking point in many notable cases, including: the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]] in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://exhibitions.cul.columbia.edu/exhibits/show/1968/timeline |title=1968:Columbia in Crisis |website=columbia.edu |publisher=Columbia University Libraries |accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/nyregion/28columbia.html |title=Columbia's Radicals of 1968 Hold a Bittersweet Reunion

===Vietnam War===
The Vietnam War, and the protracted national divide between supporters and opponents of the war, were arguably the most important factors contributing to the rise of the larger counterculture movement.

The widely accepted assertion that anti-war opinion was held only among the young is a myth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seanet.com/~jimxc/Politics/Mistakes/Vietnam_support.html |title=Support for Vietnam War |publisher=Seanet.com |date=November 21, 2002 |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/commentary/?analysisid=57 |title=Generations Divide Over Military Action in Iraq - Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press |publisher=People-press.org |date=October 17, 2002 |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but enormous war protests consisting of thousands of mostly younger people in every major US city, and elsewhere across the Western world, effectively united millions against the war, and against the war policy that prevailed under five US congresses and during two presidential administrations.

===In Western Europe===
The counterculture movement took hold in Western Europe, with London, Amsterdam, Paris, Rome, Copenhagen and West Berlin rivaling San Francisco and New York as counterculture centers.[[File:Londons Carnaby Street, 1966.jpg|thumb|left| Carnaby Street, London, 1966]]

The [[UK Underground]] was a movement linked to the growing subculture in the US and associated with the hippie phenomenon, generating its own magazines and newspapers, fashion, music groups, and clubs. Underground figure [[Barry Miles]] said, "The underground was a catch-all sobriquet for a community of like-minded anti-establishment, anti-war, pro-rock'n'roll individuals, most of whom had a common interest in recreational drugs. They saw peace, exploring a widened area of consciousness, love and sexual experimentation as more worthy of their attention than entering the rat race. The straight, consumerist lifestyle was not to their liking, but they did not object to others living it. But at that time the middle classes still felt they had the right to impose their values on everyone else, which resulted in conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miles|first1=Barry|title=Spirit of the underground: the 60s rebel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jan/30/underground-arts-60s-rebel-counterculture|website=theguardian.com|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=July 1, 2014|date=January 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, [[Provo (movement)|Provo]] was a counterculture movement that focused on "provoking violent responses from authorities using non-violent bait."&lt;ref name="Tusman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee Tusman|title=Really Free Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uauLZBSGcEIC&amp;pg=PA159|publisher=PediaPress|pages=159–|id=GGKEY:UWBUGNHU1F4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kommune 1]] or K1 was a commune in West Germany, and was known for its bizarre staged events that fluctuated between [[satire]] and [[Agent provocateur|provocation]]. These events served as inspiration for the "[[Revolutionary spontaneity|Sponti]]" movement and other leftist groups. In the late summer of 1968, the commune moved into a deserted factory on Stephanstraße in order to reorient. This second phase of Kommune 1 was characterized by sex, music and drugs. Soon, the commune was receiving visitors from all over the world, including [[Jimi Hendrix]].&lt;ref&gt;''Keith Richards: The Biography'', by Victor Bockris&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berke1969"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph H. Berke|title=Counter culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_wDAQAAIAAJ|year=1969|publisher=Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Eastern Europe===

''[[Mánička]]'' is a [[Czech language|Czech]] term used for young people with long hair, usually males, in [[Czechoslovakia]] through the 1960s and 1970s. Long hair for males during this time was considered an expression of political and social attitudes in [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)|communist Czechoslovakia]]. From the mid-1960s, the long-haired and "untidy" persons (so called ''máničky'' or ''vlasatci'' (in English: [[wikt:Mops|Mops]]) were banned from entering pubs, cinema halls, theatres and using public transportation in several Czech cities and towns.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"&gt;[[#Pokorná|Pokorná (2010)]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the public transportation regulations in [[Most (Most District)|Most]] and [[Litvínov]] excluded long-haired ''máničky'' as displeasure-evoking persons. Two years later, the municipal council in [[Poděbrady]] banned ''máničky'' from entering cultural institutions in the town.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt; In August 1966, ''[[Rudé právo]]'' informed that ''máničky'' in [[Prague]] were banned from visiting restaurants of the I. and II. price category.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt;

In 1966, during a big campaign coordinated by the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]], around 4,000 young males were forced to cut their hair, often in the cells with the assistance of the state police.&lt;ref name="radioprague"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/cz/clanek/127919|title=Háro a Vraťe nám vlasy!|last=Faltýnek|first=Vilém|date=2010-05-16|website=[[Czech Radio|Radio Praha]]|language=Czech|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August 1966, during a "safety intervention" organized by the state police, 140 long-haired people were arrested. As a response, the "community of long-haired" organized a protest in [[Prague]]. More than 100 people cheered slogans such as "Give us back our hair!" or "Away with hairdressers!". The state police arrested the organizers and several participants of the meeting. Some of them were given prison sentences.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt; According to the newspaper ''[[Mladá fronta Dnes]]'', the Czechoslovak Ministry of Interior in 1966 even compiled a detailed map of the frequency of occurrence of long-haired males in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ct24.cz/domaci/97481-policejni-akce-vlasatci-kniha-vratte-nam-vlasy-prinasi-nove-dokumenty/|title=Policejní akce Vlasatci - kniha Vraťte nám vlasy přináší nové dokumenty|publisher=[[Česká televize]]|language=Czech|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1969, during the first anniversary of the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia]], the long-haired youth were one of the most active voices in the state protesting against the occupation.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt; Youth protesters have been labeled as "vagabonds" and "slackers" by the official [[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|normalized]] press.&lt;ref name="Pokorná"/&gt;

[[File:Oz-31-cover.jpg|thumb|''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' number 31 cover]]

''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' magazine was first published as a satirical humour magazine between 1963 and 1969 in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], and, in its second and better known incarnation, became a "psychedelic hippy" magazine from 1967 to 1973 in [[London]]. Strongly identified as part of the [[underground press]], it was the subject of two celebrated [[obscenity]] trials, one in Australia in 1964 and the other in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Brennan|first1=AnnMarie|editor1-last=Brown|editor1-first=Alexandra|editor2-last=Leach|editor2-first=Andrew|title=Strategies of a Counter-Culture Oz Magazine and the Techniques of the Joke|journal=Society of Architectural Historians, Australia and New Zealand Held on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia|date=July 2–5, 2013|volume=2|page=595–|url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/536244/R03_04_Brennan_Strategies-of-a-Counterculture.pdf|accessdate=January 13, 2015|isbn=978-0-9876055-0-4|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318033520/http://www.griffith.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/536244/R03_04_Brennan_Strategies-of-a-Counterculture.pdf|archive-date=March 18, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McIntyre2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain McIntyre|title=Tomorrow Is Today: Australia in the Psychedelic Era, 1966-1970|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AGiu7Typ4iQC&amp;pg=PA51|date=January 1, 2006|publisher=Wakefield Press|isbn=978-1-86254-697-4|pages=51–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, rock music was tied into the youth revolt of the 1960s. Mexico City, as well as northern cities such as [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo Laredo]], [[Ciudad Juárez]], and [[Tijuana]], were exposed to US music. Many Mexican rock stars became involved in the counterculture. The three-day [[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro]], held in 1971, was organized in the valley of Avándaro near the city of [[Toluca]], a town neighboring Mexico City, and became known as "The Mexican Woodstock". Nudity, drug use, and the presence of the US flag scandalized conservative Mexican society to such an extent that the government clamped down on rock and roll performances for the rest of the decade. The festival, marketed as proof of Mexico's modernization, was never expected to attract the masses it did, and the government had to evacuate stranded attendees en masse at the end. This occurred during the era of [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Luis Echeverría]], an extremely repressive era in Mexican history. Anything that could be connected to the counterculture or student protests was prohibited from being broadcast on public airwaves, with the government fearing a repeat of the [[Tlatelolco massacre|student protests]] of 1968. Few bands survived the prohibition; though the ones that did, like Three Souls in My Mind (now [[El Tri]]), remained popular due in part to their adoption of Spanish for their lyrics, but mostly as a result of a dedicated underground following. While Mexican rock groups were eventually able to perform publicly by the mid-1980s, the ban prohibiting tours of Mexico by foreign acts lasted until 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zolov|first1=Eric|title=Refried Elvis: The Rise of the Mexican Counterculture|date=1999|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-520-21514-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cordobazo]] was a civil uprising in the city of [[Córdoba, Argentina]], in the end of May 1969, during the military dictatorship of General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]], which occurred a few days after the ''[[Rosariazo]]'', and a year after the French [[May '68]]. Contrary to previous protests, the Cordobazo did not correspond to previous struggles, headed by [[Marxist]] workers' leaders, but associated students and workers in the same struggle against the [[Military dictatorship|military government]].&lt;ref name=Bermand&gt;Carmen Bernand, « D'une rive à l'autre », ''Nuevo Mundo Mundos Nuevos, Materiales de seminarios'', 2008 (Latin-Americanist Review published by the [[EHESS]]), Put on line on June 15, 2008.

===Civil Rights Movement===
{{Main|Civil Rights Movement}}

The Civil Rights Movement, a key element of the larger counterculture movement, involved the use of applied [[nonviolence]] to assure that equal rights guaranteed under the [[US Constitution]] would apply to all citizens. Many states illegally denied many of these rights to African-Americans, and this was successfully addressed in the early and mid-1960s in several major nonviolent movements.&lt;ref name="HillBuckler2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bennett D.

===Free Speech===
{{Main|Free Speech Movement}}

Much of the 1960s counterculture originated on college campuses. The 1964 Free Speech Movement at the University of California, Berkeley, which had its roots in the Civil Rights Movement of the [[southern United States]], was one early example. At Berkeley a group of students began to identify themselves as having interests as a class that were at odds with the interests and practices of the University and its corporate sponsors. Other rebellious young people, who were not students, also contributed to the Free Speech Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsm-a.org/ |title=Free Speech Movement Archives Home Page - events from 1964 and beyond |publisher=FSM-A |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Left===
{{Main|New Left}}

The ''New Left'' is a term used in different countries to describe [[left-wing]] movements that occurred in the 1960s and 1970s in the [[Western world]]. They differed from earlier leftist movements that had been more oriented towards [[labour movement|labour]] activism, and instead adopted [[social activism]]. The US "New Left" is associated with college campus mass protests and radical leftist movements. The British "New Left" was an intellectually driven movement which attempted to correct the perceived errors of "[[Old Left]]" parties in the post-World War II period. The movements began to wind down in the 1970s, when activists either committed themselves to party projects, developed [[social justice]] organizations, moved into [[identity politics]] or [[alternative lifestyles]], or became politically inactive.&lt;ref name="Marcuse2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Herbert Marcuse|title=The New Left and the 1960s: Collected Papers of Herbert Marcuse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ML6GAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|date=October 14, 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-77459-3|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Almeida2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dimitri Almeida|title=The Impact of European Integration on Political Parties: Beyond the Permissive Consensus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oD7bKbo0FYEC&amp;pg=PA53|date=April 27, 2012|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-34039-0|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buchanan2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tom Buchanan|title=Europe's Troubled Peace: 1945 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAHcBeZhm6UC&amp;pg=PA102|date=January 30, 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-65578-8|pages=102–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He travelled widely and his work was often discussed in the mass media, becoming one of the few American intellectuals to gain such attention. Never surrendering his revolutionary vision and commitments, Marcuse continued to his death to defend the Marxian theory and libertarian socialism."

The New Left also led to a revival of anarchism. Journals like ''Radical America'' and ''[[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]]'' in America, ''[[Solidarity (UK)|Solidarity]]'', ''[[Big Flame (political group)|Big Flame]]'' and ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'', succeeded by ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/ The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy].

As Farrell puts it, 'Catholic Workers identified the issues of the sixties before the Sixties began, and they offered models of protest long before the protest decade.{{'}}" [http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SA/en/display/268 "The Spirit of the Sixties: The Making of Postwar Radicalism" by James J.

After the [[Stonewall Rebellion]], the New York [[Gay Liberation Front]] based their organization in part on a reading of [[Murray Bookchin]]'s anarchist writings."

But the movements of the sixties were driven by concerns that were more compatible with an expressive style of politics, with hostility to authority in general and state power in particular&amp;nbsp; ... By the late sixties, political protest was intertwined with cultural radicalism based on a critique of all authority and all hierarchies of power. Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies. The influence of anarchism was strongest among radical feminists, in the commune movement, and probably in the Weather Underground and elsewhere in the violent fringe of the anti-war movement."

Opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] began in 1964 on United States college campuses. Student activism became a dominant theme among the baby boomers, growing to include many other demographic groups. Exemptions and deferments for the middle and upper classes resulted in the induction of a disproportionate number of poor, working-class, and minority registrants. Countercultural books such as [[MacBird]] by [[Barbara Garson]] and much of the counterculture music encouraged a spirit of non-conformism and anti-establishmentarianism. By 1968, the year after a large march [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam|to the United Nations]] in [[New York City]] and a large protest at the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam|Pentagon]] were undertaken, a majority of people in the country opposed the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Feminism===
{{Main|Second-wave feminism}}
The role of women as full-time homemakers in industrial society was challenged in 1963, when US feminist [[Betty Friedan]] published ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', giving momentum to the women's movement and influencing what many called [[Second-wave feminism]]. Other activists, such as [[Gloria Steinem]] and [[Angela Davis]], either organized, influenced, or educated many of a younger generation of women to endorse and expand feminist thought. Feminism gained further currency within the protest movements of the late 1960s, as women in movements such as [[Students for a Democratic Society]] rebelled against the "support" role they had been consigned to within the male-dominated New Left, as well as against manifestations and statements of [[sexism]] within some radical groups. The 1970 pamphlet ''Women and Their Bodies'', soon expanded into the 1971 book ''[[Our Bodies, Ourselves]]'', was particularly influential in bringing about the new feminist consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/history/us-history-ii/the-new-frontier-and-the-great-society/the-counterculture-of-the-1960s|title=The Counterculture of the 1960s|website=www.cliffsnotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s counterculture embraced a [[Back-to-the-land movement|back-to-the-land]] ethic, and communes of the era often relocated to the country from cities. Influential books of the 1960s included [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' and [[Paul Ehrlich]]'s ''[[The Population Bomb]]''. Counterculture environmentalists were quick to grasp the implications of Ehrlich's writings on [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], the Hubbert "[[peak oil]]" prediction, and more general concerns over [[pollution]], [[litter]], the environmental effects of the Vietnam War, automobile-dependent lifestyles, and [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. More broadly they saw that the dilemmas of energy and resource allocation would have implications for geo-politics, lifestyle, environment, and other dimensions of modern life. The "back to nature" theme was already prevalent in the counterculture by the time of the 1969 Woodstock festival, while the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970 was significant in bringing environmental concerns to the forefront of youth culture. At the start of the 1970s, counterculture-oriented publications like the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]'' and ''[[The Mother Earth News]]'' were popular, out of which emerged a [[back to the land]] movement. The 1960s and early 1970s counterculture were early adopters of practices such as [[recycling]] and [[organic farming]] long before they became mainstream. The counterculture interest in [[ecology]] progressed well into the 1970s: particularly influential were New Left eco-anarchist [[Murray Bookchin]], [[Jerry Mander]]'s criticism of the effects of [[television]] on society, [[Ernest Callenbach]]'s novel ''[[Ecotopia]]'', [[Edward Abbey]]'s fiction and non-fiction writings, and [[E.F. Schumacher]]'s economics book ''[[Small is Beautiful]]''.

===Gay liberation===

[[File:Stonewall Inn 1969.jpg|upright|thumb|left|The Stonewall Inn, Greenwich Village, New York City, September 1969]]

The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the [[Stonewall Inn]], a gay bar in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[New York City]]. This is frequently cited as the first instance in US history when people in the gay community fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities, and became the defining event that marked the start of the [[Gay rights movement]] in the United States and around the world.

===Hippies===
{{Further|History of the hippie movement}}

After the January 14, 1967 [[Human Be-In]] in [[San Francisco]] organized by artist [[Michael Bowen (artist)|Michael Bowen]], the media's attention on culture was fully activated.&lt;ref&gt;Martin A. Lee, Acid Dreams The CIA, LSD, and the Sixties Rebellion, [[Grove Press]] 1985, Pgs.&amp;nbsp;157–163 {{ISBN|978-0-394-62081-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, [[Scott McKenzie]]'s rendition of the song "[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]" brought as many as 100,000 young people from all over the world to celebrate San Francisco's "[[Summer of Love]]." While the song had originally been written by [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]] of [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]] to promote the June 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]], it became an instant hit worldwide (#4 in the United States, #1 in Europe) and quickly transcended its original purpose.

San Francisco's [[flower children]], also called "hippies" by local newspaper columnist [[Herb Caen]], adopted new styles of dress, experimented with [[psychedelic drug]]s, lived communally and developed a vibrant music scene. When people returned home from "The Summer of Love" these styles and behaviors spread quickly from San Francisco and Berkeley to many US and Canadian cities and European capitals. Some hippies formed communes to live as far outside of the established system as possible. This aspect of the counterculture rejected active political engagement with the mainstream and, following the dictate of Timothy Leary to "[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]", hoped to change society by [[dropping out]] of it. Looking back on his own life (as a Harvard professor) prior to 1960, Leary interpreted it to have been that of "an anonymous institutional employee who drove to work each morning in a long line of commuter cars and drove home each night and drank martinis&amp;nbsp; ... like several million [[middle-class]], liberal, intellectual robots."

As members of the hippie movement grew older and moderated their lives and their views, and especially after US involvement in the Vietnam War ended in the mid-1970s, the counterculture was largely absorbed by the mainstream, leaving a lasting impact on philosophy, morality, music, art, alternative health and diet, lifestyle and fashion.

In addition to a new style of clothing, philosophy, art, music and various views on anti-war, and anti-establishment, some hippies decided to turn away from modern society and re-settle on ranches, or communes. The very first of communes in the United States was a seven-acre land in Southern Colorado, named [[Drop City]]. According to Timothy Miller, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Drop City brought together most of the themes that had been developing in other recent communities-anarchy, pacifism, sexual freedom, rural isolation, interest in drugs, art-and wrapped them flamboyantly into a commune not quite like any that had gone before&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, M. (2010) Droppers: America's First Hippie Commune, Drop City. University of Oklahoma Press. p56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of the inhabitants practiced acts like reusing trash and recycled materials to build Geodesic domes for shelter and other various purposes; using various drugs like marijuana and LSD, and creating various pieces of [[Drop Art]]. After the initial success of Drop City, visitors would take the idea of communes and spread them. Another commune called "The Ranch" was very similar to the culture of Drop City, as well as new concepts like giving children of the commune extensive freedoms known as "children's rights".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, B. (1981). The Survival of a Counterculture: Ideological work and everyday life among rural communards. University of California Press. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marijuana, LSD, and other recreational drugs===
{{See also|History of LSD}}
{{Psychedelic sidebar|Culture}}
{{Cannabis sidebar|Arts and Culture}}

During the 1960s, this second group of casual [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD) users evolved and expanded into a [[subculture]] that extolled the mystical and religious symbolism often engendered by the drug's powerful effects, and advocated its use as a method of raising [[consciousness]]. The personalities associated with the subculture, gurus such as Timothy Leary and [[psychedelic rock]] musicians such as the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Pink Floyd]], Jimi Hendrix, [[The Byrds]], [[The 13th Floor Elevators]], [[Ultimate Spinach]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young|Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash]], [[The Doors]], [[Blue Cheer]], [[The Chambers Brothers]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and the Beatles, soon attracted a great deal of publicity, generating further interest in LSD.

The popularization of LSD outside of the medical world was hastened when individuals such as [[Ken Kesey]] participated in drug trials and liked what they saw. Tom Wolfe wrote a widely read account of these early days of LSD's entrance into the non-academic world in his book ''[[The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test]]'', which documented the cross-country, acid-fueled voyage of Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters on the psychedelic bus "Furthur" and the Pranksters' later "Acid Test" LSD parties. In 1965, [[Sandoz]] laboratories stopped its still legal shipments of LSD to the United States for research and psychiatric use, after a request from the US government concerned about its use. By April 1966, LSD use had become so widespread that ''[[Time Magazine]]'' warned about its dangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899158,00.html |title=Drugs: The Dangers of LSD |publisher=TIME |date=April 22, 1966 |accessdate=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1966, the [[exploitation film]] ''[[Hallucination Generation]]'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|60488|Hallucination Generation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'' in 1967 and ''[[Psych-Out]]'' in 1968.

====Psychedelic research and experimentation====
As most research on psychedelics began in the 1940s and 50s, heavy experimentation made its effect in the 1960s during this era of change and movement. Researchers were gaining acknowledgment and popularity with their promotion of psychedelia. This really anchored the change that counterculture instigators and followers began. Most research was conducted at top collegiate institutes, such as [[Harvard University]].

[[Timothy Leary]] and his Harvard research team had hopes for potential changes in society. Their research began with [[psilocybin]] mushrooms and was called the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]]. In one study known as the [[Concord Prison Experiment]], Leary investigated the potential for psilocybin to reduce [[recidivism]] in criminals being released from prison. After the research sessions, Leary did a follow-up. He found that "75% of the turned on prisoners who were released had stayed out of jail."&lt;ref name="Lattin"&gt;Lattin, Don. The Harvard Psychedelic Club: How Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, Huston Smith, and Andrew Weil Killed the Fifties and Ushered in a New Age for America. New York: HarperOne, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed he had solved the nation's crime problem. But with many officials skeptical, this breakthrough was not promoted.

Because of the personal experiences with these drugs Leary and his many outstanding colleagues, [[Aldous Huxley]] (''[[The Doors of Perception]]'') and [[Alan Watts]] (''The Joyous Cosmology'') believed that these were the mechanisms that could bring peace to not only the nation but the world. As their research continued the media followed them and published their work and documented their behavior, the trend of this counterculture drug experimentation began.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Timothy. Flashbacks: An Autobiography. Los Angeles: J.P. Tarcher, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leary made attempts to bring more organized awareness to people interested in the study of psychedelics. He confronted the Senate committee in Washington and recommended for colleges to authorize the conduction of laboratory courses in psychedelics. He noted that these courses would "end the indiscriminate use of LSD and would be the most popular and productive courses ever offered".&lt;ref&gt;Young, Warren R., and Joseph R. Hixson. LSD on Campus. New York: [[Dell Pub.]], 1966. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these men were seeking an ultimate enlightenment, reality eventually proved that the potential they thought was there could not be reached, at least in this time. The change they sought for the world had not been permitted by the political systems of all the nations these men pursued their research in. Ram Dass states, "Tim and I actually had a chart on the wall about how soon everyone would be enlightened ... We found out that real change is harder. We downplayed the fact that the psychedelic experience isn't for everyone."&lt;ref name="Lattin"/&gt;

Leary and his team's research got shut down at Harvard and everywhere they relocated around the globe. Their outlawish behavior and aggressive approach with these drugs did not settle well with the law. Officials did not agree with this chaotic promotion of peace.

Research with [[psychedelic drug]]s and those who conducted it was a radical understanding for the vast majority of the world. However, it did create a change. A ripple of curiosity was created as a result and the wave is continuing to swell.

====Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters====
Ken Kesey and his [[Merry Pranksters]] helped shape the developing character of the 1960s counterculture when they embarked on a cross-country voyage during the summer of 1964 in a psychedelic school bus named "Furthur". Beginning in 1959, Kesey had volunteered as a research subject for medical trials financed by the CIA's ''[[Project MKULTRA|MK ULTRA]]'' project. These trials tested the effects of LSD, psilocybin, [[mescaline]], and other psychedelic drugs. After the medical trials, Kesey continued experimenting on his own, and involved many close friends; collectively they became known as "The Merry Pranksters". The Pranksters visited Harvard LSD proponent Timothy Leary at his [[Millbrook, New York|Millbrook]], New York retreat, and experimentation with LSD and other psychedelic drugs, primarily as a means for internal reflection and personal growth, became a constant during the Prankster trip.

The Pranksters created a direct link between the 1950s [[Beat Generation]] and the 1960s psychedelic scene; the bus was driven by Beat icon [[Neal Cassady]], Beat poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] was on board for a time, and they dropped in on Cassady's friend, Beat author [[Jack Kerouac]] - though Kerouac declined to participate in the Prankster scene. After the Pranksters returned to California, they popularized the use of LSD at so-called "[[Acid Tests]]", which initially were held at Kesey's home in [[La Honda, California]], and then at many other West Coast venues. The cross country trip and Prankster experiments were documented in [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test]]'', a masterpiece of [[New Journalism]].

====Other psychedelics====
Experimentation with LSD, [[peyote]], [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, [[3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine|MDA]], [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], and other psychedelic drugs became a major component of 1960s counterculture, influencing philosophy, [[Psychedelic art|art]], music and styles of dress. Jim DeRogatis wrote that peyote, a small cactus containing the psychedelic alkaloid mescaline, was widely available in [[Austin, Texas]], a countercultural hub in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Sexual revolution===
{{Main|Sexual revolution}}
The sexual revolution (also known as a time of "sexual liberation") was a social movement that challenged traditional codes of behavior related to sexuality and [[interpersonal relationship]]s throughout the [[Western world]] from the 1960s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name=allyn&gt;{{harvnb|Allyn|2000}}{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual liberation included increased acceptance of sex outside of traditional heterosexual, monogamous relationships (primarily marriage).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Escoffier|2003}}{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Birth control|Contraception]] and [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], [[public nudity]], the normalization of [[premarital sex]], [[homosexuality]] and alternative forms of sexuality, and the legalization of [[abortion]] all followed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Germaine Greer]] and [[The Female Eunuch]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenwood.com/catalog/GR9913.aspx |title=Abc-Clio |publisher=Greenwood.com |accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative media===
{{Main|Alternative media}}

[[Underground newspapers]] sprang up in most cities and college towns, serving to define and communicate the range of phenomena that defined the counterculture: radical political opposition to "[[The Establishment]]", colorful experimental (and often explicitly drug-influenced) approaches to art, music and cinema, and uninhibited indulgence in sex and drugs as a symbol of freedom. The papers also often included comic strips, from which the [[underground comix]] were an outgrowth.

As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives. The forms of escape and resistance manifest in many ways including social activism, alternative lifestyles, dress, music and alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a [[Frisbee]].

===Avant-garde art and anti-art===
{{See also|Happening}}

The [[Situationist International]] was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957, and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented [[general strike|general]] [[wildcat strikes]] of [[May 1968 in France]]. With their ideas rooted in [[Marxism]] and the 20th-century European artistic [[avant-garde]]s, they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the [[capitalism|capitalist order]], for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality. For this purpose they suggested and experimented with the ''construction of situations'', namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations, like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]]. They fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in [[advanced capitalism]]. Their theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]]. Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like [[mass media]] and [[advertising]] have a central role in an advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life. [[Raoul Vaneigem]] wrote ''[[The Revolution of Everyday Life]]'' which takes the field of "[[everyday life]]" as the ground upon which communication and participation can occur, or, as is more commonly the case, be perverted and abstracted into pseudo-forms.

[[Fluxus]] (a name taken from a [[Latin]] word meaning "to flow") is an international network of artists, composers and designers noted for blending different artistic media and disciplines in the 1960s. They have been active in [[Neo-Dada]] [[noise music]], [[visual art]], literature, [[urban planning]], architecture, and design. Fluxus is often described as [[intermedia]], a term coined by Fluxus artist [[Dick Higgins]] in a famous 1966 essay. Fluxus encouraged a "[[do-it-yourself]]" aesthetic, and valued simplicity over complexity. Like [[Dada]] before it, Fluxus included a strong current of anti-commercialism and an [[anti-art]] sensibility, disparaging the conventional market-driven art world in favor of an artist-centered creative practice. As Fluxus artist [[Robert Filliou]] wrote, however, Fluxus differed from Dada in its richer set of aspirations, and the positive social and communitarian aspirations of Fluxus far outweighed the anti-art tendency that also marked the group.

In the 1960s, the Dada-influenced [[art group]] [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] declared that revolutionary art should be "an integral part of life, as in primitive society, and not an appendage to wealth."&lt;ref name="Ben Morea: art and anarchism"&gt;Hinderer, Eve. [http://www.16beavergroup.org/monday/archives/001031print.html Ben Morea: art and anarchism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425191200/http://www.16beavergroup.org/monday/archives/001031print.html |date=April 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]] disrupted cultural events in New York by giving made up flyers of art events to the homeless with the lure of free drinks.&lt;ref name="The Assault on Culture 1"&gt;[[Stewart Home]]. [http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/sp/assault.htm "The Assault on Culture: Utopian currents from Lettrisme to Class War"]. Introduction to the Lithuanian edition. (Ist edition Aporia Press and Unpopular Books, London 1988.) {{ISBN|978-0-948518-88-1}}. "In the sixties Black Mask disrupted reified cultural events in New York by making up flyers giving the dates, times and location of art events and giving these out to the homeless with the lure of the free drink that was on offer to the bourgeoisie rather than the lumpen proletariat; I reused the ruse just as effectively in London in the 1990s to disrupt literary events."&lt;/ref&gt; After, the [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers|Motherfuckers]] grew out of a combination of Black Mask and another group called Angry Arts. [[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]] (often referred to as simply "the Motherfuckers", or UAW/MF) was an [[anarchist]] [[affinity group]] based in [[New York City]].

During the early 1960s, [[British Invasion|Britain's new wave of musicians gained popularity and fame in the United States]]. Artists such as the Beatles paved the way for their compatriots to enter the US market.&lt;ref&gt;R. Shuker, 1998, p. 34{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beatles themselves were influenced by many artists, among them American singer-songwriter [[Bob Dylan]], who was a lyrical inspiration as well as their introduction to [[marijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Brown and S. Gaines, 1984, p. 134{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan's early career as a [[protest singer]] had been inspired by artists like [[Pete Seeger]]&lt;ref&gt;J.

J. Matusow, 1984, p. 295{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music of the 1960s moved towards an electric, [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] version of rock, thanks largely to Bob Dylan's decision to play an electric guitar at the 1965 [[Newport Folk Festival]].{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 32}}&lt;ref name="Sounes"&gt;H. Sounes, 2002, p. 218{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly popularized electric sound of rock was then built upon and molded into [[psychedelic rock]] by artists like [[The 13th Floor Elevators]]&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Strong, 1997, p. 276{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British bands [[Pink Floyd]] and the Beatles.&lt;ref&gt;Shuker, 1998, p. 234{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Beach Boys]]' 1966 album ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' also paved the way for later [[hippie]] acts, with [[Brian Wilson]]'s writing interpreted as a "plea for love and understanding."&lt;ref&gt;J. Derogatis, 1996, p. 19{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pet Sounds'' served as a major source of inspiration for other contemporary acts, most notably directly inspiring the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band''. The single "[[Good Vibrations]]" soared to number one globally, completely changing the perception of what a record could be.{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 37}} It was during this period that the highly anticipated album ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' was to be released. However, the project collapsed and The Beach Boys released a downgraded version called ''[[Smiley Smile]]'', which failed to make a big commercial impact but was also highly influential, most notably on [[The Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]].

The Beatles went on to become the most prominent commercial exponents of the "psychedelic revolution" (e.g., ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'', ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]'') in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6595610/1_sgt_peppers_lonely_hearts_club_band |title=1) Sgt.

These included [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]] (''[[If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears]]''), [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] (''[[Cheap Thrills (Big Brother and the Holding Company album)|Cheap Thrills]]''), Jimi Hendrix (''[[Are You Experienced]]''), [[Jefferson Airplane]] (''[[Surrealistic Pillow]]''), [[The Doors]] (''[[The Doors (album)|The Doors]]'') and [[Sly and the Family Stone]] (''[[Stand!]]''). Bands and other musicians, such as the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Neil Young]] (Canada), [[David Peel (musician)|David Peel]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[The Fugs]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[John Sebastian]], [[Melanie Safka|Melanie]], [[The Velvet Underground]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[Captain Beefheart]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young|CSNY]], [[Shocking Blue]], [[Country Joe and the Fish]], and [[The Holy Modal Rounders]] were considered key to the counterculture movement.&lt;ref&gt;M.

While the hippie scene was born in [[California]],{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=shows 41-42}}&lt;ref&gt;Shuker, 1998, p. 72{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; an edgier scene emerged in [[New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;B. Longhurst, 1995, p. 108{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that put more emphasis on [[avant-garde]] and art music. Bands such as [[The Velvet Underground]] came out of this underground music scene, which was predominantly centered at [[Andy Warhol]]'s legendary [[The Factory|Factory]]. The Velvet Underground supplied the music for the [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]], a series of [[multimedia]] events staged by Warhol and his collaborators in 1966 and 1967. The Velvet Underground's lyrics were considered risqué for the era, since they discussed [[sexual fetishism]], [[transgender]] identities, and the use of [[hard drugs]] associated with Warhol's Factory and its [[Warhol superstars|superstars]].&lt;ref&gt;Derogatis, 1996, p. 44{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jimi Hendrix Experience in Fenklup.png|left|thumb|The [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]] performs for the Dutch television show Fenklup in March 1967]]

Detroit's [[MC5]] also came out of the underground rock music scene of the late 1960s. They introduced a more aggressive evolution of [[garage rock]] which was often fused with sociopolitical and countercultural lyrics of the era, such as in the song "Motor City Is Burning" (a [[John Lee Hooker]] cover adapting the story of the [[Detroit Race Riot (1943)|Detroit Race Riot]] of 1943 to the Detroit riot of 1967). MC5 had ties to radical leftist organizations such as "[[Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers]]" and [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]]'s [[White Panther Party]],&lt;ref name="Dogget2007" /&gt;{{rp|117}} and MC5 performed a lengthy set before the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]], where an infamous riot subsequently broke out between police and students protesting the [[Vietnam War]] and the recent assassinations of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Robert Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Snowman, 1978, p. 155{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MC5, [[The Stooges]] and the aforementioned Velvet Underground, are now seen as an influence on the [[protopunk]] sound that would lead to [[punk rock]] and [[heavy metal music]] in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Shuker, 1998, p. 237{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another hotbed of the 1960s counterculture was [[Austin, Texas]], with two of the era's legendary music venues-the [[Vulcan Gas Company]] and the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]]-and musical talent like [[Janis Joplin]], the [[13th Floor Elevators]], [[Shiva's Headband]], the Conqueroo, and, later, [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]. Austin was also home to a large New Left activist movement, one of the earliest underground papers, [[The Rag]], and cutting edge graphic artists like [[The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers|Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]] creator [[Gilbert Shelton]], underground comix pioneer [[Jaxon|Jack Jackson]] (Jaxon), and surrealist armadillo artist [[Jim Franklin (artist)|Jim Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim DeRogatis]], ''Turn On Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock'' (Milwaukie, MI: Hal Leonard, 2003), {{ISBN|0-634-05548-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s was also an era of [[rock festival]]s, which played an important role in spreading the counterculture across the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mankin |first=Bill |url=http://likethedew.com/2012/03/04/we-can-all-join-in-how-rock-festivals-helped-change-america/ |title=We Can All Join In: How Rock Festivals Helped Change America |work=Like the Dew: A Journal of Southern Culture and Politics |date=March 4, 2012 |accessdate=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Monterey Pop Festival]], which launched Hendrix's career in the US, was one of the first of these festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Derogatis, 1996, p. 95{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's 1968–1970 [[Isle of Wight Festival]]s drew big names such as [[The Who]], [[The Doors]], [[Joni Mitchell]], Hendrix, Dylan, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Sounes, 2002, p. 296{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1969 [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in New York state became a symbol of the movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kilgannon|first=Corey|title=3 Days of Peace and Music, 40 Years Later|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/arts/artsspecial/19love.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival drew a larger crowd.&lt;ref name="Dogget2007" /&gt;{{rp|58}} Some believe the era came to an abrupt end with the infamous [[Altamont Free Concert]] held by [[The Rolling Stones]], in which heavy-handed security from the [[Hells Angels]] resulted in the stabbing of an audience member, apparently in self-defense, as the show descended into chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Matusow, 1986, p. 305{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Doors in Copenhagen 1968.jpg|thumb|[[The Doors]] performing for [[Television in Denmark|Danish television]] in 1968]]
As the psychedelic revolution progressed, lyrics grew more complex, (such as [[Jefferson Airplane]]'s "[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]"&lt;ref&gt;Matusow, 1986, p. 297{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Long-playing albums enabled artists to make more in-depth statements than could be made in just a single song (such as the [[Mothers of Invention]]'s satirical ''[[Freak Out!]]''&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1997, p. 317{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Even the rules governing single songs were stretched, and singles lasting longer than three minutes emerged, such as Dylan's "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]", [[Arlo Guthrie]]'s "[[Alice's Restaurant]]", and [[Iron Butterfly]]'s 17-minute-long "[[In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (song)|In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida]].".&lt;ref name="Sounes" /&gt;

The 1960s saw the protest song gain a sense of political self-importance, with Phil Ochs's "[[I Ain't Marching Anymore]]" and Country Joe and the Fish's "[[I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die-Rag]]" among the many anti-war anthems that were important to the era.&lt;ref name="Dogget2007" /&gt;

[[Free jazz]] is an approach to [[jazz]] music that was first developed in the 1950s and 1960s. Although the music produced by free jazz composers varied widely, the common feature was a dissatisfaction with the limitations of [[bebop]], [[hard bop]], and [[modal jazz]], which had developed in the 1940s and 1950s. Each in their own way, free jazz musicians attempted to alter, extend, or break down the conventions of jazz, often by discarding hitherto invariable features of jazz, such as fixed [[chord change]]s or [[tempo]]s. While usually considered experimental and avant-garde, free jazz has also oppositely been conceived as an attempt to return jazz to its "primitive", often religious roots, and emphasis on collective improvisation. Free jazz is strongly associated with the 1950s innovations of [[Ornette Coleman]] and [[Cecil Taylor]] and the later works of saxophonist [[John Coltrane]]. Other important pioneers included [[Charles Mingus]], [[Eric Dolphy]], [[Albert Ayler]], [[Archie Shepp]], [[Joe Maneri]] and [[Sun Ra]]. Although today "free jazz" is the generally used term, many other terms were used to describe the loosely defined movement, including "avant-garde", "energy music" and "The New Thing". During its early and mid-60s heyday, much free jazz was released by established labels such as Prestige, Blue Note and Impulse, as well as independents such as [[ESP Disk]] and BYG Actuel. [[Free improvisation]] or ''free music'' is [[musical improvisation|improvised music]] without any rules beyond the logic or inclination of the musician(s) involved. The term can refer to both a technique (employed by any musician in any genre) and as a recognizable genre in its own right. [[Free improvisation]], as a genre of music, developed in the U.S. and Europe in the mid to late 1960s, largely as an outgrowth of [[free jazz]] and [[contemporary music|modern classical]] musics. None of its primary exponents can be said to be famous within mainstream; however, in experimental circles, a number of free musicians are well known, including saxophonists [[Evan Parker]], [[Anthony Braxton]], [[Peter Brötzmann]] and [[John Zorn]], drummer Christian Lillinger, trombonist [[George Lewis (trombonist)|George Lewis]], guitarists [[Derek Bailey (guitarist)|Derek Bailey]], [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]] and [[Fred Frith]] and the improvising groups The [[Art Ensemble of Chicago]] and [[AMM (group)|AMM]].

[[Allmusic Guide]] states that "until around 1967, the worlds of jazz and rock were nearly completely separate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d299|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term, "[[jazz-rock]]" (or "jazz/rock") is often used as a synonym for the term "[[Fusion jazz|jazz fusion]]". However, some make a distinction between the two terms. [[The Free Spirits]] have sometimes been cited as the earliest jazz-rock band.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Unterberger1998|Unterberger 1998]], pg. 329&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1960s, at the same time that jazz musicians were experimenting with rock rhythms and electric instruments, rock groups such as [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and the [[Grateful Dead]] were "beginning to incorporate elements of jazz into their music" by "experimenting with extended free-form improvisation". Other "groups such as [[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears]] directly borrowed harmonic, melodic, rhythmic and instrumentational elements from the jazz tradition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liraproductions.com/jazzrock/htdocs/histhome.htm The Jazz/Rock Fusion Page:a site is dedicated to Jazz Fusion and related genres with a special emphasis on Jazz/Rock fusion]&lt;/ref&gt; The rock groups that drew on jazz ideas (like [[Soft Machine]], [[Colosseum (band)|Colosseum]], [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]], [[Nucleus (band)|Nucleus]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Spirit (band)|Spirit]] and [[Frank Zappa]]) turned the blend of the two styles with electric instruments.&lt;ref name="tesser"&gt;N. Tesser, ''The Playboy Guide to Jazz'', (Plume, 1998), {{ISBN|0452276489}}, P. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Since rock often emphasized directness and simplicity over virtuosity, jazz-rock generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late 1960s and early 70s: psychedelia, progressive rock, and the singer-songwriter movement."&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d2776|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miles Davis]]' ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' sessions, recorded in August 1969 and released the following year, mostly abandoned jazz's usual swing beat in favor of a [[rock music|rock]]-style [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|backbeat]] anchored by [[electric bass]] grooves. The recording "... mixed free jazz blowing by a large ensemble with electronic keyboards and guitar, plus a dense mix of percussion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jazzitude.com/essential_fusion.htm Jazzitude &amp;#124; History of Jazz Part 8: Fusion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114032732/http://www.jazzitude.com/essential_fusion.htm |date=January 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis also drew on the rock influence by playing his trumpet through electronic effects and pedals. While the album gave Davis a [[gold record]], the use of electric instruments and rock beats created a great deal of consternation amongst some more conservative jazz critics.

===Film===
{{Main|1960s in film}}
The counterculture was not only affected by cinema, but was also instrumental in the provision of era-relevant content and talent for the film industry. ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' struck a chord with the youth as "the alienation of the young in the 1960s was comparable to the director's image of the 1930s."&lt;ref&gt;M. A.

In France the [[french new wave|New Wave]] was a [[blanket term]] coined by critics for a group of [[Cinema of France|French filmmakers]] of the late 1950s and 1960s, influenced by [[Italian Neorealism]] and [[classical Hollywood cinema]]. Although never a formally organized movement, the New Wave filmmakers were linked by their self-conscious rejection of classical cinematic form and their spirit of youthful [[iconoclasm]] and is an example of [[European art cinema]]. Many also engaged in their work with the social and political upheavals of the era, making their radical experiments with editing, visual style and narrative part of a general break with the conservative paradigm. The Left Bank, or ''Rive Gauche'', group is a contingent of filmmakers associated with the French New Wave, first identified as such by [[Richard Roud]].&lt;ref name=hfa&gt;"The Left Bank Revisited: Marker, Resnais, Varda", ''Harvard Film Archive'', [http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2000mayjun/leftbank.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907190306/http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2000mayjun/leftbank.html |date=September 7, 2015 }} Access date: August 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding "right bank" group is constituted of the more famous and financially successful New Wave directors associated with ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'' ([[Claude Chabrol]], [[François Truffaut]], and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]).&lt;ref name=hfa/&gt; Left Bank directors include [[Chris Marker]], [[Alain Resnais]], and [[Agnès Varda]].&lt;ref name=hfa/&gt; Roud described a distinctive "fondness for a kind of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] life and an impatience with the conformity of the Right Bank, a high degree of involvement in literature and the [[plastic arts]], and a consequent interest in [[experimental film]]making", as well as an identification with the political [[left wing|left]].&lt;ref name=hfa/&gt; Other film "new waves" from around the world associated with the 1960s are [[New German Cinema]], [[Czechoslovak New Wave]], Brazilian [[Cinema Novo]] and [[Japanese New Wave]]. During the 1960s, the term "[[art film]]" began to be much more widely used in the United States than in Europe. In the U.S., the term is often defined very broadly, to include foreign-language (non-English) [[auteur theory|"auteur"]] films, [[independent film]]s, [[experimental film]]s, documentaries and short films. In the 1960s  "art film" became a euphemism in the U.S. for racy Italian and French [[B-movies]]. By the 1970s, the term was used to describe [[pornography|sexually explicit]] European films with artistic structure such as the Swedish film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]''. The 1960s was an important period in art film; the release of a number of groundbreaking films giving rise to the [[European art cinema]] which had countercultural traits in filmmakers such as [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[Luis Buñuel]] and [[Bernardo Bertolucci]].

Cultural historians–such as [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]] in his 1986 essay "From Satori to Silicon Valley" and John Markoff in his book ''[[What the Dormouse Said]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/mac/primary/docs/satori/index.html "From Satori to Silicon Valley"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608070447/http://www-sul.stanford.edu/mac/primary/docs/satori/index.html |date=June 8, 2011 }} - Roszak, Stanford&lt;/ref&gt; have pointed out that many of the early pioneers of [[personal computing]] emerged from within the West Coast counterculture. Many early computing and networking pioneers, after discovering [[LSD]] and roaming the campuses of UC Berkeley, Stanford, and MIT in the late 1960s and early 1970s, would emerge from this caste of social "misfits" to shape the modern world of technology, especially in [[Silicon Valley]].

===Religion, spirituality and the occult===

Many hippies rejected mainstream organized religion in favor of a more personal spiritual experience, often drawing on indigenous and folk beliefs. If they adhered to mainstream faiths, hippies were likely to embrace [[Buddhism]], [[Daoism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Unitarian Universalism]] and the [[restorationist]] Christianity of the [[Jesus Movement]]. Some hippies embraced [[neo-paganism]], especially [[Wicca]]. Wicca is a witchcraft religion which became more prominent beginning in 1951, with the repeal of the [[1735 Witchcraft Act|Witchcraft Act of 1735]], after which [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] and then others such as [[Charles Cardell]] and [[Cecil Williamson]] began publicising their own versions of the Craft. Gardner and others never used the term "Wicca" as a religious identifier, simply referring to the "witch cult", "witchcraft", and the "Old Religion". However, Gardner did refer to witches as "the Wica".&lt;ref name="WitchcraftToday"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Gerald B |authorlink=Gerald Gardner (Wiccan) |title=Witchcraft Today |publisher=Mercury Publishing |location=Lake Toxaway, NC |year=1999 |origyear=1954 |oclc=44936549 |isbn=978-0-8065-2593-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, the name of the religion normalised to "Wicca".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=vii}}&lt;ref name="Seims 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thewica.co.uk/wica_or_wicca.htm |title=Wica or Wicca? – Politics and the Power of Words |journal=The Cauldron |first=Melissa |last=Seims |issue=129 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner's tradition, later termed [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerianism]], soon became the dominant form in [[England]] and spread to other parts of the [[British Isles]]. Following Gardner's death in 1964, the Craft continued to grow unabated despite sensationalism and negative portrayals in British tabloids, with new traditions being propagated by figures like [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]], [[Sybil Leek]] and most importantly [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]], whose [[Alexandrian Wicca]], which was predominantly based upon Gardnerian Wicca, albeit with an emphasis placed on [[ceremonial magic]], spread quickly and gained much media attention.

In his 1991 book, ''Hippies and American Values'', Timothy Miller described the hippie ethos as essentially a "religious movement" whose goal was to transcend the limitations of mainstream religious institutions. "Like many dissenting religions, the hippies were enormously hostile to the religious institutions of the dominant culture, and they tried to find new and adequate ways to do the tasks the dominant religions failed to perform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7F31yYxOMAC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;q=hippie%20as%20a%20religious%20movements |first=Timothy|last= Miller|title=Hippies and American Values |publisher=Univ Tennessee Press; 1st edition|accessdate=October 11, 2013|isbn=9780870496943|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his seminal, contemporaneous work, ''The Hippie Trip'', author Lewis Yablonsky notes that those who were most respected in hippie settings were the spiritual leaders, the so-called "high priests" who emerged during that era.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hippie Trip'', Lewis Yablonsky, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

One such hippie "high priest" was San Francisco State College instructor [[Stephen Gaskin]]. Beginning in 1966, Gaskin's "Monday Night Class" eventually outgrew the lecture hall, and attracted 1,500 hippie followers in an open discussion of spiritual values, drawing from Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu teachings. In 1970, Gaskin founded a Tennessee community called [[The Farm (Tennessee)|The Farm]], and he still lists his religion as "Hippie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefarm.org/lifestyle/miller.html |title=Communal Religions |publisher=Thefarm.org |date=October 6, 1966 |accessdate=November 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511184303/http://www.thefarm.org/lifestyle/miller.html |archivedate=May 11, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokeofthetown.com/2010/12/new_book_tells_inside_story_of_biggest_hippie_comm.php |title=New Book Tells Inside Story Of Biggest Hippie Commune In U.S. - Toke of the Town - cannabis news, views, rumor and humor |publisher=Toke of the Town |date=December 23, 2010 |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Stephen Gaskin |isbn=9781570671814 |title=Monday Night Class |publisher=Amazon.com |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timothy Leary was an American [[psychology|psychologist]] and writer, known for his advocacy of psychedelic drugs. On September 19, 1966, Leary founded the [[League for Spiritual Discovery]], a religion declaring LSD as its holy sacrament, in part as an unsuccessful attempt to maintain legal status for the use of LSD and other psychedelics for the religion's adherents based on a "freedom of religion" argument. ''[[The Psychedelic Experience]]'' was the inspiration for John Lennon's song "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" in The Beatles' album ''[[Revolver (The Beatles album)|Revolver]]''.&lt;ref name="Sante"&gt;{{cite news| last = Sante| first = Luc| title = The Nutty Professor | work=[[The New York Times Book Review]]| date = June 26, 2006| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25sante.html| accessdate = July 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a pamphlet in 1967 called ''Start Your Own Religion'' to encourage just that (see below under "writings") and was invited to attend the January 14, 1967 [[Human Be-In]]  a gathering of 30,000 [[hippie]]s in San Francisco's [[Golden Gate Park]] In speaking to the group, he coined the famous phrase "[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eFaq_I24teQC&amp;pg=PA641 |title=Timothy Leary: A Biography|first=Robert|last= Greenfield |accessdate=October 11, 2013|isbn=9780151005000|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Principia Discordia]]'' is the founding text of [[Discordianism]] written by Greg Hill ([[Malaclypse the Younger]]) and [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]] (Lord Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst). It was originally published under the title "Principia Discordia or How The West Was Lost" in a limited edition of five copies in 1965. The title, literally meaning "Discordant Principles", is in keeping with the tendency of [[Latin]] to prefer hypotactic grammatical arrangements. In English, one would expect the title to be "Principles of Discord."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frauenfelder|first=Mark|title=Publisher alters, then copyrights Principia Discordia|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/01/publisher-alters-the.html|newspaper=Boing Boing|date=November 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and legacy==
The lasting impact, including unintended consequences, creative output and general legacy of the counterculture era continue to be actively discussed, debated, despised and celebrated.

Even the notions of when the counterculture subsumed the Beat Generation, when it gave way to the successor generation, and what happened in between are open for debate. According to notable UK Underground and counterculture author Barry Miles, "It seemed to me that the Seventies was when most of the things that people attribute to the sixties really happened: this was the age of extremes, people took more drugs, had longer hair, weirder clothes, had more sex, protested more violently and encountered more opposition from the establishment. It was the era of sex and drugs and rock'n'roll, as [[Ian Dury]] said. The countercultural explosion of the 1960s really only involved a few thousand people in the UK and perhaps ten times that in the USA – largely because of opposition to the Vietnam war, whereas in the Seventies the ideas had spread out across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miles|first1=Barry|title=In the Seventies: Adventures in the Counterculture (Comments from the Author's Website)|url=http://barrymiles.co.uk/all-books/in-the-seventies/|website=barrymiles.co.uk|publisher=Barry Miles|accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Columbia University teaching unit on the counterculture era notes: "Although historians disagree over the influence of the counterculture on American politics and society, most describe the counterculture in similar terms. Virtually all authors—for example, on the right, [[Robert Bork]] in [[Slouching Towards Gomorrah|''Slouching Toward Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline'']] (New York: Regan Books,1996) and, on the left, [[Todd Gitlin]] in ''The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage'' (New York: Bantam Books, 1987)—characterize the counterculture as self-indulgent, childish, irrational, narcissistic, and even dangerous. Even so, many liberal and leftist historians find constructive elements in it, while those on the right tend not to."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caho-test.cc.columbia.edu/pcp/14203.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328235327/http://caho-test.cc.columbia.edu/pcp/14203.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-28 |title=The Legacy of the Counterculture |last1=George |first1=Jason |date=2004 |website=columbia.edu |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=May 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screen legend [[John Wayne]] equated aspects of 1960s social programs with the rise of the [[welfare state]], "... I know all about that. In the late Twenties, when I was a sophomore at USC, I was a socialist myself—but not when I left. The average college kid idealistically wishes everybody could have ice cream and cake for every meal. But as he gets older and gives more thought to his and his fellow man's responsibilities, he finds that it can't work out that way—that some people just won't carry their load ... I believe in welfare—a welfare work program. I don't think a fella should be able to sit on his backside and receive welfare. I'd like to know why well-educated idiots keep apologizing for lazy and complaining people who think the world owes them a living. I'd like to know why they make excuses for cowards who spit in the faces of the police and then run behind the judicial sob sisters.

The "generation gap" between the affluent young and their often poverty-scarred parents was a critical component of 1960s culture. In an interview with journalist [[Gloria Steinem]] during the 1968 US presidential campaign, soon-to-be First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] exposed the generational chasm in worldview between Steinem, 20 years her junior, and herself after Steinem probed Mrs. Nixon as to her youth, role models, and lifestyle. A hardscrabble child of the Great Depression, Pat Nixon told Steinem, "I never had time to think about things like that, who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work. I haven't just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do ... I've kept working. I don't have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I never had it easy.

Even before the counterculture movement reached its peak of influence, the concept of the adoption of socially-responsible policies by establishment corporations was discussed by economist and [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel laureate]] [[Milton Friedman]] (1962): "Few trends could so thoroughly undermine the very foundation of our free society as the acceptance by corporate officials of a social responsibility other than to make as much money for their stockholders as possible. This is a fundamentally subversive doctrine. If businessmen do have a social responsibility other than making maximum profits for stockholders, how are they to know what it is? Can self-selected private individuals decide what the social interest is?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silk|first1=Leonard|last2=Silk|first2=Mark|title=The American Establishment|date=1980|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-00134-7|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, author and former Free Speech activist [[Greil Marcus]] was quoted, "What happened four decades ago is history. It's not just a blip in the history of trends. Whoever shows up at a march against war in Iraq, it always takes place with a memory of the efficacy and joy and gratification of similar protests that took place in years before ... It doesn't matter that there is no counterculture, because counterculture of the past gives people a sense that their own difference matters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/23/style/a-movement-yes-but-no-counterculture.html? |title=A Movement, Yes, but No Counterculture

When asked about the prospects of the counterculture movement moving forward in the digital age, former Grateful Dead lyricist and self-styled "cyberlibertarian" [[John Perry Barlow]] said, "I started out as a teenage beatnik and then became a hippie and then became a cyberpunk. And now I'm still a member of the counterculture, but I don't know what to call that. And I'd been inclined to think that that was a good thing, because once the counterculture in America gets a name then the media can coopt it, and the advertising industry can turn it into a marketing foil. But you know, right now I'm not sure that it is a good thing, because we don't have any flag to rally around. Without a name there may be no coherent movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utne.com/community/cognitivedissidentjohnperrybarlow.aspx#axzz32SGxVXXx |title=Cognitive Dissident: John Perry Barlow

During the era, conservative students objected to the counterculture and found ways to celebrate their conservative ideals by reading books like [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s ''A Study of Communism'', joining student organizations like the [[College Republicans]], and organizing [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek events]] which reinforced gender norms.&lt;ref name="rollandiamondanotherside"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rolland-Diamond|first1=Caroline|title=Another Side of the Sixties: Festive Practices on College Campuses and the Making of a Conservative Youth Movement|journal=Revue Française d'Études Américaines|date=2016|volume=1|issue=146|pages=39–53|url=http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_ARTICLE=RFEA_146_0039&amp;WT.mc_id=RFEA_146|accessdate=October 24, 2016|via=[[Cairn.info]]|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free Speech advocate and social anthropologist  Jentri Anders observed that a number of freedoms were endorsed within a countercultural community in which she lived and studied: "freedom to explore one's potential, freedom to create one's Self, freedom of personal expression, freedom from scheduling, freedom from rigidly defined roles and hierarchical statuses ..." Additionally, Anders believed some in the counterculture wished to modify children's education so that it didn't discourage, but rather encouraged, "aesthetic sense, love of nature, passion for music, desire for reflection, or strongly marked independence."&lt;ref&gt;Jentri Anders, Beyond Counterculture, Washington State University Press, 1990, {{ISBN|978-0-87422-060-5}} &amp; {{ISBN|978-0-87422-060-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kitchell, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Merry Prankster [[Carolyn Adams|Carolyn "Mountain Girl" Garcia]] commented, "I see remnants of that movement everywhere. It's sort of like the nuts in Ben and Jerry's ice cream -- it's so thoroughly mixed in, we sort of expect it. The nice thing is that eccentricity is no longer so foreign. We've embraced diversity in a lot of ways in this country. I do think it's done us a tremendous service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/SUMMER-OF-LOVE-40-YEARS-LATER-Just-a-season-2559193.php#photo-2702198 |title=SUMMER OF LOVE: 40 YEARS LATER

==Key figures==
[[File:Jerry Rubin - Spectrum 13Mar1970.jpg|thumb|Jerry Rubin, University at Buffalo, March 10, 1970]]

The following people are well known for their involvement in 1960s era counterculture. Some are key incidental or contextual figures, such as Beat Generation figures who also participated directly in the later counterculture era. The primary area(s) of each figure's notability are indicated, per these figures' Wikipedia pages. This section is not intended be exhaustive, but rather a representative cross section of individuals active within the larger movement. Although many of the people listed are known for civil rights activism, some figures whose primary notability was within the realm of the Civil Rights Movement are listed elsewhere.  This section is not intended to create associations between any of the listed figures beyond what is documented elsewhere.

In [[mathematics]], a '''cross-cap''' is a two-dimensional surface in 3-space that is one-sided and the continuous image of a [[Möbius strip]] that intersects itself in an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]]. In the domain, the inverse image of this interval is a longer interval that the mapping into 3-space "folds in half". At the point where the longer interval is folded in half in the image, the nearby configuration is that of the [[Whitney umbrella]].  

The interval of self intersection precludes the cross-cap from being [[homeomorphic]] to the [[Möbius strip]], but there are only two points in the image (the endpoints of the interval of self-intersection) where the image cannot be that of an immersion. The bounding edge of a cross-cap is a simple closed loop. Like certain versions of the Möbius strip, it may take the form of a symmetrical [[circle]].

A cross-cap that has been closed up by gluing a [[Disk (mathematics)|disc]] to its boundary is a model of the [[real projective plane]] P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (again with an interval of self-intersection, and two points where this model is not an immersion of P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Two cross-caps glued together at their boundaries form a model of the [[Klein bottle]], this time with two intervals of self-intersection and four points where this model is not an immersion.

An important theorem of [[topology]], the [[classification theorem for surfaces]], states that each [[two-dimensional]] compact [[manifold]] without boundary is homeomorphic to a sphere with some number (possibly 0) of "handles" and 0, 1, or 2 cross-caps.

The '''''Dashboard of Sustainability''''' is a free-of-charge, non-commercial software package configured to convey the complex relationships among economic, social, and environmental issues.
The software is designed to help developing countries achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] and work towards [[sustainable development]]. The software package was developed by members of the Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indicators (CGSDI),&lt;ref&gt;Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indicators.  (2006)  ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/dashboard.asp Dashboard of Sustainability.]''; see also ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/history.asp CGSDI history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106123832/http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/history.asp |date=2007-01-06 }}'' and ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/members.asp CGSDI members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224102435/http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/members.asp |date=2007-02-24 }}'', all obtained Apr. 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been applied to quite a number of indicator sets, inter alia to the Millennium Development Goals indicators and the United Nations [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] indicators.

In 2002, Dashboard of Sustainability researchers Jochen Jesinghaus and Peter Hardi presented the Dashboard of Sustainability at the [[Earth Summit 2002|Johannesburg Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;IISD Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB) ''[http://www.iisd.ca/2002/wssd/enbots/aug30.html ENB on the side, Aug. 30, 2002]'' obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2002 [[World Social Forum]] in [[Porto Alegre]].&lt;ref&gt;Ranjit Devraj (TerraViva), ''[http://ipsnews.net/terraviva/05_dashboard.shtml Internet Dashboard Device for Navigating Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411090712/http://www.ipsnews.net/terraviva/05_dashboard.shtml |date=2007-04-11 }}'', obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was also included in the resources for the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] World Forum on Key Indicators.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2004), ''[http://www.oecd.org/document/2/0,2340,en_21571361_31834434_33637186_1_1_1_1,00.html European Union 2002, Dashboard of Sustainability]'', obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, the Millennium Project utilized the Dashboard of Sustainability to conclude in their [[State of the Future]] report that global prospects for improving the overall health, wealth, and sustainability of humanity are improving, but slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Jerome C.; Gordon, Theodore J.

'''Dhi''' (Sanskrit: धी), this [[Sanskrit]] word means 'understanding', 'reflection', 'religious thought', 'mind', 'design', 'intelligence', 'opinion', 'meditation', 'imagination', 'notion', 'intellect',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary|publisher=Spokensanskrit.de|url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=HK&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=dhi+&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU }}&lt;/ref&gt; This word is directly connected with the word, [[Vāc]] (Sanskrit: वाच) meaning Speech, derived from Vac (Sanskrit: वच) meaning, 'to speak'. ''Dhi'' is the voiced ''Vāc'' or '[[Speech]]', it is the thought-mind or intellect. ''Dhi'' also means 'to hold' or 'to place', and indicates the activity of the intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Symbolism|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Lotus Press|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iR1L8V8bxqgC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iWHNUtqjB8nKhAfCy4GYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The natural meaning of ''Dhi'' is '[[Thought]]' which corresponds to the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Buddhi]]'' which means 'the activity of mind', 'thought', 'understanding' and 'intelligence'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hymns to the Mystic Fire|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Lotus Press|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WuOFGN8s4s0C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-V7NUvuqMYmShgeT7YGACw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vedic Sanskrit]] employs two words ''Dhi'' and [[Brahman]] for prayerful or meditative contemplation in which context ''Dhi'' means 'visionary insight', 'intense thought and reflection', and the word Brahman is derived from the root ''brh'', meaning 'to grow', 'to expand'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana|author=Ian Whicher|publisher=SUNY Press|page=311|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Qo9K9hPvQgC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u1_NUtTwBdKShgfKjYDQBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Manu Smriti]] describes ten essential rules for observance of [[Dharma]] (the path of righteousness or the 'Law of Being', which binds the people of this world and the whole creation) – ''Dhriti'' ('patience'), ''[[Kshama]]'' ('forgiveness'), ''Dama'' ('self-control'), ''[[Asteya]]'' ('honesty'), ''Shauch'' ('purity'), ''Indriya-nigrah'' ('control of senses'), ''Dhi'' ('reasoning'), ''Vidya'' ('knowledge and learning'), ''[[Satya]]'' ('truthfulness') and ''[[Akrodha]]'' ('control of anger').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basics of Hinduism|author=Shivendra Kumar Sinha|publisher=Unicorn Books|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pSOEETzRVqsC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CmDNUuGSH5GjhgeqioH4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

'''Dhi''', the prefix of ''Dhimahi'' and ''Dhiyo'' occurring in the [[Gayatri Mantra]] ([[Rig Veda]]III.62.10) refers to 'understanding', and its cognate word ''Buddhi'' means 'reasoning faculty of the mind', which understanding must be transcended to experience the Ultimate Reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Philosophy: An Introduction|author=M.Ram Murty|publisher=Broadview Press|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chQjTOdnlLIC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CmDNUuGSH5GjhgeqioH4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word, ''Dhira'', meaning 'calm', denotes the seeker whose intellect is saturated in knowledge which word is the combination of ''Dhi'' meaning 'intellect' and ''ra'' meaning 'fire' or 'wisdom'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jnana Sankalini Tantra|author=Paramhansa Prjnananda|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=191|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bq-LDHAYbzAC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CmDNUuGSH5GjhgeqioH4Dg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Non-Atman i.e. the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|Anatman]], which is by its nature disagreeable, is the object of the function of ''Dhi'' (=''buddhi'') which reveals the joy (''ananda''), the nature of the individual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Suresvara’s Vartika on Yajnavalkya’s – Maitreyi Dialogue|author=Suresvaracharya|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvcrBnKaIgEC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r2DNUt3nGIm7hAep9IDYBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Patanjali]] defines [[Yoga]] as neutralization of the alternating waves in consciousness; in the phrase ''citta vritti nirodha'' (Yoga Sutra I.2), ''[[Citta]]'' refers to the 'thinking principle' and includes 'pranic life forces', to ''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|Manas]]'' ('mind' or 'sense consciousness'), ''[[Ahamkara]]'' ('egoity') and ''[[Buddhi]]'' ('intuitive intelligence'), and ''[[Vritti]]'' refers to the waves of thought and emotion that ceaselessly arise and [[Nirodha]] refers to 'neutralization', 'cessation' or 'control'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography of a Yogi|author=Sri Paramhansa Yogananda|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xsIi4ePN4hYC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;dq=dhi+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r2DNUt3nGIm7hAep9IDYBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root ''budh'' and its derivatives appear in the [[Vedas]] in the sense of 'kindling' or 'awakening', the word ''buddhi'' appears for the first time in ''Samkhyayana Brahmana Upanishad''. ''Dhi'' is derived from ''dhriti'' and its cognate ''didhiti'', it also refers to flash of intuition which is beyond all purely sensuous perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Spirituality Vedas Through Vedanta|author=Krishna Sivaraman|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=192,210|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lktl97WdxWkC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iWHNUtqjB8nKhAfCy4GYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mental organs are ''manas'' ('mind') and ''hrd'' ('heart'), and the mental faculties are ''citta'' ('thought'), ''dhi'' ('mental vision') and ''kratu'' ('mental power'). ''Manas'' is said to perform the processes indicated by the verbal roots '''cit-'', ''dhi-'' and ''man-''; ''dhi'' requires ''kratu'' in actualizing visions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Indian Psychology|author=N.Ross Reat|publisher=Jain Publishing Co.|pages=96–135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0nHmSni1NEC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vmLNUq71OJGrhAfKuYCYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection with Vāc==

'''Dhi''' refers to 'vision' or 'inspiration which is the exceptional faculty of acquiring a sudden knowledge of transcendent truth or reality', 'the inner light of visionary insight'. [[Soma (deity)|Soma]] is the Lord of Vision who dispenses inspiration and Speech (Vāc) is inspired thought (''manisa'') or wisdom guarded by the seers on the seat of ''[[Rta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Literature (Samhitas and Brahmanas)|author=Jan Gonda|publisher=Otto Harrasowitz Veriag|pages=66–71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ogb24XeQOZ8C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iWHNUtqjB8nKhAfCy4GYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rig Veda]] links language not only to thought (''manas'') but also to vision (''dhi''), a word from which comes ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]]'' meaning 'meditation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Discovering the Vedas: Origins, Mantras, Rituals, Insights|author=Frits Staal|publisher=Penguin Books|page=293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcE23SjLX8sC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iWHNUtqjB8nKhAfCy4GYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Yajurveda]] (29.8), [[Sarasvati]], the Goddess of Speech, is invoked to grant the gift of ''Dhi'', inspired thought, and thought is linked with ''Vāc''; [[Sarasvati River|Sarasvati]] is also known as the river of inspired thought,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sarasvati, Riverine Goddess of Knowledge|author=Catherine Ludvik|publisher=BRILL|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lsYKIXBOK0C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=dhi+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vmLNUq71OJGrhAfKuYCYAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dhi%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vedas]] are the sacred texts of the [[Hindus]]. They are the repository of what is the known or required to be known, in other words, the true knowledge or the transcendent eternal wisdom articulated in [[Sound]] ('sabda') or [[Speech]] ('vāc'). The [[Vedic]] [[Rishi|seers]] have associated the power of speech or the spoken word with ultimacy and transcendence – ''ekam sat'' ([[Rig Veda]] I.164.46). They also know [[Vishwakarma]], the creator, as Vācaspati, the Lord of Speech ([[Rig Veda]] X.81.7) (who is also called [[Brihaspati]] and Brahmanaspati), and that Vāc or speech or utterance as [[Brahman]] is the creative principle and the absolute force in the universe; the person who has gained its knowledge is said to have attained the highest knowledge ([[Rig Veda]] X.125.5). As far as Brahman extends so far does ''Vāc'' ([[Rig Veda]] X.114.8).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond the Written Word: Oral Aspects of Scripture in the History of Religion|author=William A.graham|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzYX0T-ZqTcC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=vac+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6_3MUr2vGZGihgeDh4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of Vāc==

The Inspired thought (''dhi'') that precedes utterance though connected with speech undergoes some modifications while being transformed into speech; the [[Vedic]] [[Rishis]] tell us that the thoughtful one's produce speech with their mind ([[Rig Veda]] X.71.2), the different stages in transformation from ''dhi'' to ''vāc'' are described in the [[Atharvaveda]] (VII.1.1). ''Dhi'' is the voiced speech. Goddess Saraswati presides over speech but ''vāc'' extends far above and beyond Saraswati ([[Rig Veda]] X.125) beyond all known spheres ([[Rig Veda]] X.114.8). Vāc is dependent on breath or air; and the [[Aitareya Brahmana]] (IV.42.1) states ''Brahman vai vāk'', Vāc is the mother of the Vedas and the Vedas themselves ([[Shatapatha Brahmana]] (6.5.3.4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sarasvati, Riverine Goddess of Knowledge|author=Catherine Ludvik|publisher=BRILL|pages=33, 37, 60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lsYKIXBOK0C&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=vac+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6_3MUr2vGZGihgeDh4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Vedas are a form of the ritual and cosmological ''Vāc'' (speech). Vāc is presented as consort of [[Prajapati]] (Kathaka Samhita 12.5.27.1) whom the Brahmanas  express as 'the expressed' (''nirukta'') and as the 'unexpressed' (''anirukta''), the limited and the unlimited. [[Taittiriya Aranyaka]] tells us that Vāc is the imperishable one, the (''[[Aksara]]''), the first-born of the cosmic order (''[[Rta]]''), the mother of the Vedas (''vedanam mata''), the navel of immortality (''[[Amrita]]'') and therefore Vedas themselves are infinite (''[[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]]''), immortal (''amrta'') and imperishable (''akshita''). The ''Jaiminiya Upanishad'' tells us that [[Om|Aum]] or Om, the essence of all essences, is [[Vāc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Authority, Anxiety, and Canon: Essays in Vedic Interpretation|author=Barbara A.Holdrege|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=2, 40, 49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z8CGJBo3z4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=vac+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6_3MUr2vGZGihgeDh4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the human plane the mind precedes speech, and on the cosmic plane Prajapati precedes ''vāc'' as the Lord of Thought and Speech, who brings forth ''vāc'' to unite with ''vāc'' to manifest creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Veda and Torah: Transcending the Textuality of Scripture|author= Barbara A.Holdrege|publisher=SUNY Press|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v_H31Q_eq84C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=vac+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6_3MUr2vGZGihgeDh4DYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purpose of invoking [[Agni]] and other ''[[Devatas (Vedanta)|devatas]]'', the [[mantra]]s of the [[Rig Veda]] have a very essential role to play because the ''Upasaka'' when meditating is required to think of the Rcs as Vāc i.e. speech; it is for this reason that the mantras are chanted and there is a prescribed way to do that chanting. Rishi [[Medhātithi|Medhatithi Kanva]] ([[Rig Veda]] I.12.11) prays:

:स नः सत्वान आ भर गायत्रेन नवीयसा |
:रयिं वीरवतिमिषम् ||

"May Agni accept the words of praise (adoration) set in newer hymns composed in Gayatri metre and devoutly sung (chanted), (May Agni) accept the oblations made in it (in the prescribed manner) of the offerings rightly earned and belonging to the performers of rites." And, Rishi Ayasya (Rig Veda IX.46.2) praying thus-

:परिष्कृतास इन्दवो योषेव पित्र्यावती |
:वायुं सोमा असृक्षत ||

informs us that having acquired the knowledge of the highest the learned people (easily) unravel the deeply hidden meaning of the most subtle kind. This means, that each experience of ours is a re-discovery of ourselves, and that in order to really re-discover ourselves so as to understand our true nature we have to firstly awaken our mind, then make the mind speak loudly enough to be heard because [[Prana]], which is the body of the mind, is that very silence waiting to be heard. A sage of the Rig Veda (Rig Veda X.20.9) states that the creator vested ''[[Agni]]'' with three coloured flames and made it brilliant, eminent, swift-acting and hot. The sage of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] tells us that behind all things are these three colours, the rest constituted out of them are a modification and a name. Speech is Rk or ''[[Brhati]]'' identified with ''[[Prana]]'' whose lord is [[Brihaspati]], the same lord is Brahmanaspati when speech is ''[[Yajus]]'' associated with Brahman. Speech is ''Sama''; it cannot reveal itself for it is as formless as the air on which it rides; it rides upon the streams of air constituting the wind, and words once uttered do not return to the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=47, 77, 62, 87, 93|url=https://www.amazon.in/s?ie=UTF8&amp;field-author=Ravinder%20Kumar%20Soni&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3A976389031%2Cp_27%3ARavinder%20Kumar%20Soni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yajnavalkya]] tells King [[Janaka]] that the light that comes nearest to the supreme light of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is the light of Vāc i.e. speech, since it is the supreme faculty of reason that finally lifts the consciousness towards the pure self-shining awareness of the Atman, and which after serving as a pointer vanishes or goes to rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of the Upanishads Vol.3|author=Swami Parmeshwaranad|publisher=-Sarup and Sons|page=309|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgwzp6-HTTIC&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=vac+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kwXNUraJJZGThQfFwIGABw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedic sages have all along advocated 'Truth', 'Penance' and 'Study' as special virtues. Amongst these three special virtues Truth is held out to be the supreme virtue to be practised by all aspirants. All primary virtues are firstly imbibed from the parents; [[Satyakama Jabala]] acquired the spirit of truthfulness from his mother, and [[Sanat Kumara]] taught [[Narada]] that Truth has to be sought for realization – "when one indeed understands Truth in its reality one speaks the truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Search of True Happiness|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=Soni Parivar|page=14|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While describing the rituals associated with the [[Ashvamedha]] [[yajna]], in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] we are told that the neighing of the horse, representing the cosmos, is Vāc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sources of Indian Tradition|author=Stephen N.Hay|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBWzV-TRXzkC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=vac+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kwXNUraJJZGThQfFwIGABw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vac%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claim for primacy==

A sage of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] after declaring that the syllable ''[[Om|Aum]]'', having the individual and also the cosmic efficacy, not only serves to help the meditation of the individual person but even the Sun travels the universe singing ''Aum'' as does ''Prana'' moving in the body (Ch.Up.I.5.1,3) explains that that ''[[Om|Aum]]'' is the essence of all beings on this earth, the essence of a person is speech and the essence of speech is the [[Rig Veda]] (Ch.Up.I.1.2) but the essence of [[Samaveda]], which is the essence of the Rig Veda, is ''[[Om|Udgitha]]'' which is ''Aum''. He declares that all speech is interwoven on the symbol ''Aum'', in the same manner as the leaves of a tree are woven together on a stalk (Ch.Up.II.23.3). Speech is the fuel of fire which is man (Ch.Up.V.7.1). Mind consists of 'food', the Prana consists of 'water' and speech consists of 'fire' (Ch.Up.VI.6.5). [[Narada]] is told by [[Sanat Kumara]] that all this is but a name by which one knows, even then speech is greater than name because if there is no speech neither righteousness nor unrighteousness would be known, but surely the mind is greater than speech for mind  is the entire world (Ch.Up.VII.2 &amp; 3) establishing the claim of the mind (''dhi'') for primacy over speech (''vāc'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|pages=83, 214, 245|url=https://archive.org/stream/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5706">The '''differential outcomes effect''' is a [[theory]] in [[behaviorism]], a branch of [[psychology]], that shows that a positive effect on [[accuracy]] occurs in [[discrimination learning]] between different [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] when unique rewards are paired with each individual stimulus.  The DOE was first demonstrated in 1970 by Milton Trapold on an experiment with [[rats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trapold|first=Milton A.|date=1970-05|title=Are expectancies based upon different positive reinforcing events discriminably different?|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1016/0023-9690(70)90079-2|journal=Learning and Motivation|volume=1|issue=2|pages=129–140|doi=10.1016/0023-9690(70)90079-2|issn=0023-9690}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rats were trained to discriminate between a clicker and a tone by pressing the left and right levers.  Half of the rats were trained using the differential outcomes procedure, where the clicker was paired with sucrose and tone with food pellets.  The remaining rats were trained with only sucrose or only food pellets.  The rats trained with the differential outcomes procedure were significantly more accurate than those trained with only one type of reinforcement (common outcome).  Since then it has been established through a myriad of [[experiments]] that the Differential Outcome Effect exists in most [[species]] capable of [[learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Urcuioli|first=Peter J.|date=2005-2|title=Behavioral and associative effects of differential outcomes in discrimination learning|journal=Learning &amp; Behavior|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–21|issn=1543-4494|pmid=15971490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The Differential Outcomes Effect not only states that an [[association (psychology)|association]] between a stimulus and a [[Stimulus (psychology)|response]] is formed as [[traditional]] [[Classical Conditioning]] states, but that a [[simultaneous]] association is formed between a stimulus and a [[reinforcer]] in the [[Human subject research|subject]]. If one were to pair a stimulus with a reinforcer, that is known as a differential condition. When this is employed, one can expect a higher accuracy in tests when discriminating between two stimuli, due to this increased amount of [[information]] available to the subject than in a nondifferential condition.

==History==
In 1970 the Differential Outcome Effect was discovered by Trapold when testing the reasoning behind the theory. He created an experiment where rats were taught to discriminate between a clicking noise and a tone. He associated the left bar with the clicking noise and the right bar with the [[Musical tone|tone]]. The experimental group was given [[sucrose]] for one response and [[food]] for the other. The control group was randomly given either food or sucrose for each response. The rats in the [[experimental group]] were able to [[discriminate]] between the two stimuli faster than the rats in the [[control group]].

The Differential Outcome Effect was then found to exist in various species including but not limited to [[rats]], [[pigeons]] and [[horses]], over the years and was then finally explored in [[humans]] by Pauline Maki, J. Bruce Overmier, Sandra Delos, and Arlyne Gutmann in 1995. They tested [[children]] who were from 4 to 7 years old to discriminate between two different [[shapes]]. Children who were given either a reinforcer consisting of food for one response or given a verbal reinforcer for another response gave far more accurate answers than those who were given random reinforcers for different responses.

Then in 2002; Odette Miller, Kevin Waugh and Karen Chambers proved that Differential Outcome Effect exists in [[adults]]. This [[experiment]] was novel because it first used average adults ([[college students]])  in the experiment, and had a complex discrimination task which required participants to be able to distinguish between 15 different [[Kanji]] characters. In prior experiments, participants were only required to discriminate between two different stimuli. For the participants in the group given a differential condition, each Kanji character was given a unique [[photo]] and [[prize]] for answering correctly. Participants in the group given a  nondifferential condition were given a random photo and prize for answering the question correctly. The group given a differential condition fared far better than those in the group with the nondifferential condition, demonstrating that the Differential Outcome Effect not only exists in adult humans but also can be applied to tasks requiring discrimination of more than two stimuli.

More recently several studies have looked at the applications of the differential outcomes effect for populations with intellectual disabilities and pervasive developmental disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esevez,|first=A|date=2003|title=Differential Outcomes Effect in Children and Adults With Down Syndrome.|url=http://www.aaiddjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1352/0895-8017(2003)108%3C0108:DOEICA%3E2.0.CO;2?code=aamr-site|journal=American Journal on Mental Retardation:|volume=108|pages=108–116|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCormack|first=Jessica|last2=Arnold-Saritepe|first2=Angela|last3=Elliffe|first3=Douglas|date=2017-06-30|title=The differential outcomes effect in children with autism|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bin.1489|journal=Behavioral Interventions|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=357–369|doi=10.1002/bin.1489|issn=1072-0847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientist have theorised that this procedure may be useful in overcoming barriers to learning.

&lt;!-- many terms should be wikilinked and/or defined. --&gt;

A '''digital identity''' is information on an entity used by [[Computer|computer systems]] to represent an external agent. That agent may be a person, organization, application, or device. ISO/IEC 24760-1 defines identity as "set of attributes related to an entity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2011 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57914 |title=ISO/IEC 24760-1: A framework for identity management - Part 1: Terminology and concepts |publisher=ISO |accessdate=2015-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The information contained in a digital identity allows for assessment and authentication of a user interacting with a business system on the web, without the involvement of human operators. Digital identities allow our access to computers and the services they provide to be automated, and make it possible for computers to mediate relationships.

The term "digital identity" has also come to denote aspects of civil and personal identity that have resulted from the widespread use of identity information to represent people in computer systems.

Digital identity is now often used in ways that require data about persons stored in computer systems to be linked to their civil, or national, identities. Furthermore, the use of digital identities are now so widespread that many discussions refer to "digital identity" as the entire collection of information generated by a person’s online activity. This includes usernames and passwords, online search activities, birth date, social security, and purchasing history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/23915/digital-identity|title=What is a Digital Identity? - Definition from Techopedia|access-date=2016-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Especially where that information is publicly available and not anonymized, and can be used by others to discover that person's civil identity. In this wider sense, a digital identity is a version, or facet, of a person's social identity. This may also be referred to as an [[online identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Global|first=IndraStra|title=Digital Identity – A Gateway to All Other Use Cases|url=http://www.indrastra.com/2018/01/Digital-Identity-Gateway-to-All-Other-Use-Cases-004-01-2018-0034.html|journal=IndraStra|issn=2381-3652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal and social effects of digital identity are complex and challenging. However, they are simply a consequence of the increasing use of computers, and the need to provide computers with information that can be used to identify external agents.

==Background==

A critical problem in cyberspace is knowing with whom one is interacting. Using static identifiers such as password and email there are no ways to precisely determine the identity of a person in digital space, because this information can be stolen or used by many individuals acting as one. Digital identity based on dynamic entity relationships captured from behavioral history across multiple websites and mobile apps can verify and authenticate an identity with up to [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/what-is-a-digital-identity/ 95 percent accuracy].

By comparing a set of entity relationships between a new event (e.g., login) and past events, a pattern of [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/digital-dna/ convergence] can verify or authenticate the identity as legitimate where divergence indicates an attempt to mask an identity. Data used for digital identity is generally [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/digital-dna/ anonymized] using a one-way hash, thereby avoiding privacy concerns. Because it is based on behavioral history, a digital identity is impossible to fake or steal.
==Related terms==

===Subject and entity===
A digital identity may also be referred to as a digital Subject or digital [[entity]] and is the digital representation of a set of claims made by one party about itself or another person, group, thing or concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.eclipse.org/Digital_Identity|title=Digital Identity - Eclipsepedia|website=wiki.eclipse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deh|first=Dragana|last2=Glođović|first2=Danica|date=2018-09-05|title=The Construction of Identity in Digital Space|url=https://fmkjournals.fmk.edu.rs/index.php/AM/article/view/257|journal=AM Journal of Art and Media Studies|language=en|volume=0|issue=16|pages=101|doi=10.25038/am.v0i16.257|issn=2406-1654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attributes, preferences and traits===
Every digital identity has zero or more [[identity attributes]]. Attributes are acquired and contain information about a subject, such as medical history, purchasing behaviour, bank balance, age and so on.&lt;ref name=Windley&gt;{{cite book |first=Phillip J. |last=Windley |title=Digital Identity |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2005 |pages=8–9 |isbn=978-0596008789}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preferences retain a subject's choices such as favourite brand of shoes, preferred currency. Traits are features of the subject that are inherent, such as eye colour, nationality, place of birth. While [[Attribute (computing)|attributes]] of a subject can change easily, traits change slowly, if at all. Digital identity also has entity relationships derived from the devices, environment and locations from which an individual transacts on the web.

==Technical aspects==

===Trust, authentication and authorization===
In order to assign a digital representation to an entity, the attributing party must trust that the claim of an attribute (such as name, location, role as an employee, or age) is correct and associated with the person or thing presenting the attribute (see [[Digital identity#Authentication|Authentication]] below). Conversely, the individual claiming an attribute may only grant selective access to its information, e.g. (proving identity in a bar or PayPal authentication for payment at a web site). In this way, digital identity is better understood as a particular viewpoint within a mutually-agreed relationship than as an objective property.

====Authentication====
[[Authentication]] is a key aspect of trust-based identity attribution, providing a codified assurance of the identity of one entity to another. Authentication methodologies include the presentation of a unique object such as a [[bank credit card]], the provision of confidential information such as a [[password]] or the answer to a pre-arranged question, the confirmation of ownership of an e-mail address, and more robust but relatively costly solutions utilizing [[encryption]] methodologies. In general, business-to-business authentication prioritises security while user to business authentication tends towards simplicity. Physical authentication techniques such as [[iris scan]]ning, [[handprinting]], and [[Speaker recognition|voiceprinting]] are currently being developed and in the hope of providing improved protection against [[identity theft]]. Those techniques fall into the area of Biometry ([[biometrics]]). A combination of static identifiers (username &amp; passwords) along with personal unique attributes (biometrics), would allow for [[Multi-factor authentication|multi factor authentication]]. This process would yield more creditable authentication, which in nature is much more difficult to be cracked and manipulated.

Whilst technological progress in authentication continues to evolve, these systems do not prevent aliases from being used. The introduction of [[strong authentication]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} for online payment transactions within the [[European Union]] now links a verified person to an account, where such person has been identified in accordance with statutory requirements prior to account being opened. Verifying a person opening an account online typically requires a form of device binding to the credentials being used. This verifies that the device that stands in for a person on the Web is actually the individuals device and not the device of someone simply claiming to be the individual. The concept of [[reliance authentication]] makes use of pre-existing accounts, to piggy back further services upon those accounts, providing that the original source is reliable. The concept of reliability comes from various anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism funding legislation in the USA,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ffiec.gov/pdf/bsa_aml_examination_manual2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; EU28,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52013PC0045:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 52013PC0045 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013C00371&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore and New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Services-Anti-Money-Laundering-AMLCFT-Act-and-Regulations|title=AML/CFT Act and Regulations|first=The Department of Internal|last=Affairs|website=www.dia.govt.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; where second parties may place reliance on the customer due diligence process of the first party, where the first party is say a financial institution. An example of reliance authentication is PayPal's verification method.

====Authorization====
[[Authorization (computer access control)|Authorization]] is the determination of any entity that controls resources that the authenticated can access those resources.  Authorization depends on authentication, because authorization requires that the critical attribute (i.e., the attribute that determines the authorizer's decision) must be verified.  For example, authorization on a credit card gives access to the resources owned by [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], e.g., Amazon sends one a product. Authorization of an employee will provide that employee with access to network resources, such as printers, files, or software.   For example, a database management system might be designed so as to provide certain specified individuals with the ability to retrieve information from a database but not the ability to change data stored in the database, while giving other individuals the ability to change data.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Consider the person who rents a car and checks into a hotel with a credit card. The car rental and hotel company may request authentication that there is credit enough for an accident, or profligate spending on room service.  Thus a card may be refused when trying to book the balloon trip,  though there is adequate credit to pay for the rental, the hotel, and the balloon trip. Then when the person leaves the hotel and returns the car, the actual charges are authorized (too late for the balloon trip).

Valid online authorization requires analysis of information related to the digital event including device and environmental variables. These are generally derived from the [https://www.digitalidentityguide.com/what-is-a-digital-identity/ hundreds of entities] exchanged between a device and business server to support an event using standard Internet protocols.

===Digital identifiers===
Digital identity fundamentally requires digital identifiers—strings or tokens that are unique within a given scope (globally or locally within a specific domain, community, directory, application, etc.). Identifiers are the key used by the parties to an identification relationship to agree on the entity being represented. Identifiers may be classified as ''omnidirectional'' and ''unidirectional''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cameron |first=Kim |title=The Laws of Identity |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms996456 |work=msdn.microsoft.com |publisher=Microsoft |date=May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omnidirectional identifiers are intended to be public and easily discoverable, while unidirectional identifiers are intended to be private and used only in the context of a specific identity relationship.

Identifiers may also be classified as resolvable or non-resolvable. Resolvable identifiers, such as a [[domain name]] or [[e-mail address]], may be dereferenced into the entity they represent, or some current state data providing relevant attributes of that entity.  Non-resolvable identifiers, such as a person's real-world name, or a subject or topic name, can be compared for equivalence but are not otherwise machine-understandable.

There are many different schemes and formats for digital identifiers. The most widely used is [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI) and its internationalized version [[Internationalized Resource Identifier]] (IRI)—the standard for identifiers on the [[World Wide Web]]. [[OpenID]] and [[Light-Weight Identity]] (LID) are two web authentication protocols that use standard [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] URIs (often called URLs), for example.

===Digital Object Architecture===
Digital Object Architecture (DOA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Robert |last1=Kahn |first2=Robert |last2=Wilensky |title=A Framework for Distributed Digital Object Services |url=http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/k-w.html |publisher=Corporation for National Research Initiatives |date=May 13, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a means of managing digital information in a network environment. A digital object has a machine and platform independent structure that allows it to be identified, accessed and protected, as appropriate. A digital object may incorporate not only informational elements, i.e., a digitized version of a paper, movie or sound recording, but also the unique identifier of the digital object and other metadata about the digital object. The metadata may include restrictions on access to digital objects, notices of ownership, and identifiers for licensing agreements, if appropriate.

===Handle System===
The [[Handle System]] is a general purpose distributed information system that provides efficient, extensible, and secure identifier and resolution services for use on networks such as the internet. It includes an open set of protocols, a [[namespace]], and a reference implementation of the protocols. The protocols enable a [[distributed computing|distributed computer system]] to store identifiers, known as handles, of arbitrary resources and resolve those handles into the information necessary to locate, access, contact, authenticate, or otherwise make use of the resources. This information can be changed as needed to reflect the current state of the identified resource without changing its identifier, thus allowing the name of the item to persist over changes of location and other related state information. The original version of the Handle System technology was developed with support from the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]].

===Extensible Resource Identifiers===
A new [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]] standard for abstract, structured identifiers, [[XRI]] (Extensible Resource Identifiers), adds new features to URIs and IRIs that are especially useful for digital identity systems. [[OpenID]] also supports XRIs, and XRIs are the basis for [[i-name]]s.

===Risk-Based Authentication===

[https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+RiskBased+Authentication+Q3+2017/-/E-RES121265 Risk-Based Authentication] is an application of digital identity whereby multiple entity relationship from the device (e.g., operating system), environment (e.g., DNS Server) and data entered by a user for any given transaction is evaluated for correlation with events from known behaviors for the same identity. Analysis are performed based on quantifiable metrics, such as transaction velocity, locale settings (or attempts to obfuscate), and user-input data (such as ship-to address). Correlation and deviation are mapped to tolerances and scored, then aggregated across multiple entities to compute a transaction risk-score, which assess the risk posed to an organization.

===Policy aspects===
There are proponents of treating self-determination and freedom of expression of digital identity as a new [[Human rights|human right]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}  Some have speculated that digital identities could become a new form of [[Juristic person|legal entity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=Clare|title=Digital Identity and Mistake|journal=International Journal of Law and Technology|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxonomies of identity===
Digital identity attributes—or data—exist within the context of [[Ontology (computer science)|ontologies]].

The development of digital identity network solutions that can interoperate taxonomically-diverse representations of digital identity is a contemporary challenge. [[Folksonomy|Free-tagging]] has emerged recently as an effective way of circumventing this challenge (to date, primarily with application to the identity of digital entities such as bookmarks and photos) by effectively flattening identity attributes into a single, unstructured layer. However, the organic integration of the benefits of both structured and fluid approaches to identity attribute management remains elusive.

===Networked identity===
Identity relationships within a digital network may include multiple identity entities. However, in a decentralised network like the Internet, such extended identity relationships effectively require both (a) the existence of independent trust relationships between each pair of entities in the relationship and (b) a means of reliably integrating the paired relationships into larger relational units. And if identity relationships are to reach beyond the context of a single, federated ontology of identity (see [[#Taxonomies of identity|Taxonomies of identity]] above), identity attributes must somehow be matched across diverse ontologies. The development of network  approaches that can embody such integrated "compound" trust relationships is currently a topic of much debate in the [[blogosphere]].

Integrated compound trust relationships allow, for example, entity A to accept an assertion or claim about entity B by entity C. C thus vouches for an aspect of B's identity to A.

A key feature of "compound" trust relationships is the possibility of selective disclosure from one entity to another of locally relevant information. As an illustration of the potential application of selective disclosure, let us suppose a certain Diana wished to book a hire car without disclosing irrelevant personal information (utilising a notional digital identity network that supports compound trust relationships). As an adult, UK resident with a current driving license, Diana might have the UK's [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] vouch for her driving qualification, age and nationality to a car-rental company without having her name or contact details disclosed. Similarly, Diana's bank might assert just her banking details to the rental company.  Selective disclosure allows for appropriate [[privacy]] of information within a network of identity relationships.

A classic form of networked digital identity based on international standards is the "White Pages".

An electronic white pages links various devices, like computers and telephones, to an individual or organization. Various attributes such as X.509v3 digital certificates for secure cryptographic communications are captured under a schema, and published in an [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] or [[X.500]] directory. Changes to the LDAP standard are managed by working groups in the [[IETF]], and changes in X.500 are managed by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. The ITU did significant analysis of gaps in digital identity interoperability via the FGidm, focus group on [[identity management]].

Implementations of X.500[2005] and LDAPv3 have occurred worldwide but are primarily located in major data centers with administrative policy boundaries regarding sharing of personal information. Since combined X.500 [2005] and LDAPv3 directories can hold millions of unique objects for rapid access, it is expected to play a continued role for large scale secure identity access services. LDAPv3 can act as a lightweight standalone server, or in the original design as a TCP-IP based Lightweight Directory Access Protocol compatible with making queries to a X.500 mesh of servers which can run the native OSI protocol.

This will be done by scaling individual servers into larger groupings that represent defined "administrative domains", (such as the country level digital object) which can add value not present in the original "White Pages" that was used to look up phone numbers and email addresses, largely now available through non-authoritative search engines.

The ability to leverage and extend a networked digital identity is made more practicable by the expression of the level of trust associated with the given identity through a common [[Identity Assurance Framework]].

===Self-sovereign identity===
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is the concept that people can store information about their digital identity in a location of their choice. This information can then provide to third parties on request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bitsonblocks.net/2017/05/17/gentle-introduction-self-sovereign-identity/|title=A gentle introduction to self-sovereign identity|date=2017-05-16|work=Bits on blocks|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of blockchain technologies decentralized identities can be based on SSI that are not owned by a single provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/the-rising-tide-of-decentralized-identity-2e163e4ec663|title=The Rising Tide of Decentralized Identity|last=Foundation|first=Decentralized Identity|date=2017-10-11|website=Decentralized Identity Foundation|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security issues and privacy==
With automated face recognition, tagging, location tracking and widespread digital authentication systems many actions of a person become easily associated with identity,&lt;ref name=Camp&gt;{{cite news |first=L. Jean |last=Camp |title=Digital Identity |journal=IEEE Technology and Society Magazine |publisher=IEEE |year=2004 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1337889&amp;contentType=Journals+%26+Magazines&amp;sortType%3Dasc_p_Sequence%26filter%3DAND%28p_IS_Number%3A29516%29}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a cause, sometimes [[privacy]] is lost and security is subverted. An identity system that builds on confirmed [[Pseudonymity|pseudonyms]] can provide privacy and enhance security for digital services and transactions. Cyberspace creates opportunities for identity theft. Exact copies of everything sent over a digital communications channel can be recorded. Thus, cyberspace needs a system that allows individuals to verify their identities to others without revealing to them the digital representation of their identities.

With sharing content on social media and the internet becoming a social norm there are many preventive measures that users can take to protect themselves. Companies and databases collect information about us, even if we're simply browsing the internet or online shopping. Collecting all this data allows for them to customize what we see based on what we like. Derived through algorithms these third parties gather information to track us.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beck|first=Estee N.|date=2015-03|title=The Invisible Digital Identity: Assemblages in Digital Networks|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compcom.2015.01.005|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=35|pages=125–140|doi=10.1016/j.compcom.2015.01.005|issn=8755-4615}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding all of this information, many of it is stored on a cloud.   Protecting one's personal information and digital identity is a gray area. As of right now laws regarding digital safety are very vague and lack validity. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Clare|date=2013-08|title=Digital identity, privacy and the right to identity in the United States of America|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2013.05.011|journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review|volume=29|issue=4|pages=348–358|doi=10.1016/j.clsr.2013.05.011|issn=0267-3649}}&lt;/ref&gt;In addition to the legal aspects, this ethically cross a line.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; We are presented with the legal terms which are known as the terms and conditions, which are discussed more in depth in [[Privacy]], however as users we do not always know what we are agreeing to. Companies capitalize on the fine print and gather more information about us then needed for that product to successfully work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holt|first=Jennifer|last2=Malčić|first2=Steven|date=2015|title=The Privacy Ecosystem: Regulating Digital Identity in the United States and European Union|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jinfopoli.5.2015.0155|journal=Journal of Information Policy|volume=5|pages=155–178|doi=10.5325/jinfopoli.5.2015.0155}}&lt;/ref&gt; With data breaches and identity fraud occurring more and more, an example of a solution is to remove the idea of a whole identity from users. Instead of using very specific information to identify oneself online, use one thing to separate yourself from the rest of online users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/jpss/2018/00000012/00000001/art00006|title=Rethinking digital identity|last=Michael|first=Salmony,|website=www.ingentaconnect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anonymous attribute systems===
An anonymous attribute is one that retains its uniqueness, but is put through a one-way hash so that it is represented in a string of characters that have no innate meaning or value. The one-way hash is an algorithm of inordinate complexity that generates the character string so that it is indecipherable compared to the original. In this way, a social security number, can be retained for attribute comparison, but the values used for comparison, while unique, would in no way resemble the original social security number.

==Legal issues==
Clare Sullivan presents the grounds for digital identity as an emerging legal concept.&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;{{cite book |first=Clare |last=Sullivan |url=http://www.adelaide.edu.au/press/titles/digital-identity/ |title=Digital Identity |publisher=The University of Adelaide |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-9807230-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's [[Identity Cards Act 2006]] confirms Sullivan's argument and unfolds the new legal concept involving database identity and transaction identity. Database identity refers to the collection of data that is registered about an individual within the databases of the scheme and transaction identity is a set of information that defines the individual's identity for transactional purposes. Although there is reliance on the verification of identity, none of the processes used are entirely trustworthy. The consequences of digital identity abuse and fraud are potentially serious, since in possible implications the person is held legally responsible.&lt;ref name=Sullivan/&gt;

==Business aspects==
Corporations have begun to recognize the Internet's potential to facilitate the tailoring of the online storefront to each individual customer. Purchase suggestions, personalised adverts and other tailored marketing strategies are a great success to businesses. Such tailoring however, depends on the ability to connect attributes and preferences to the identity of the visitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Hal |last1=Ableson |first2=Lawrence |last2=Lessig |title=Digital Identity in Cyberspace |date=10 September 1998 |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall98-papers/identity/linked-white-paper.html |work=MIT.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variance by jurisdiction==
While many facets of digital identity are universal owing in part to the ubiquity of the Internet, some regional variations exist due to specific laws, practices and government services that are in place.  For example, [[Digital identity in Australia]] can utilize services that validate [[Driving licences]], [[Passports]] and other physical documents online to help improve the quality of a digital identity, also strict [[Money laundering#Australia|Anti-money laundering]] policies mean that some services, such as money transfers need a stricter level of validation of digital identity.

In [[reliability engineering]], '''dual modular redundancy''' ('''DMR''') is when components of a system are duplicated, providing [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] in case one should fail. It is particularly applied to systems where the duplicated components work in parallel, particularly in [[fault-tolerant computer system]]s. A typical example is a complex computer system which has duplicated nodes, so that should one node fail, another is ready to carry on its work.

DMR provides robustness to the failure of one component, and [[error detection]] in case instruments or computers that should give the same result give different results, but does not provide [[error correction]], as ''which'' component is correct and which is malfunctioning cannot be automatically determined. There is an old adage to this effect, stating: "Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 0-201-83595-9 | title = [[The Mythical Man-Month]] | last = Brooks | first = Frederick J. | authorlink = Fred Brooks | year = 1995 | origyear = 1975 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | page = 64  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meaning, if two [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]] contradict, how do you know which one is correct?

A [[lockstep (computing)|lockstep]] fault-tolerant machine uses replicated elements operating in parallel. At any time, all the replications of each element should be in the same state. The same inputs are provided to each replication, and the same outputs are expected. The outputs of the replications are compared using a voting circuit. A machine with two replications of each element is termed dual modular redundant (DMR). The voting circuit can then only detect a mismatch and recovery relies on other methods.  Examples include [[1ESS switch]].

A machine with three replications of each element is termed [[triple modular redundancy|triple modular redundant]] (TMR). The voting circuit can determine which replication is in error when a two-to-one vote is observed. In this case, the voting circuit can output the correct result, and discard the erroneous version. After this, the internal state of the erroneous replication is assumed to be different from that of the other two, and the voting circuit can switch to a DMR mode. This model can be applied to any larger number of replications.

The Submarine Command System [[SMCS]] used on submarines of the [[Royal Navy]] employs duplicated central computing nodes, interconnected by a duplicated LAN.

[[File:Court of Chancery edited.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Court of Chancery]], [[London]], in the early 19th century]]

In jurisdictions following the [[English law|English]] [[Common law#History|common law system]], '''equity''' is the body of law which was developed in the English [[Court of Chancery]] and which is now administered concurrently with the [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;'Common law' here is used in its narrow sense, referring to that body of law principally developed in the superior courts of common law: [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's Bench]] and [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Pleas]].&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of its history, the English common law was principally developed and administered in the central royal courts: the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]], the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], and the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer]]. Equity was the name given to the law which was administered in the [[Court of Chancery]]. The [[Judicature Acts|Judicature Reforms]] in the 1870s effected a procedural fusion of the two bodies of law, ending their institutional separation. The reforms did not effect any substantive fusion, however. Judicial or academic reasoning which assumes the contrary has been described as a "fusion fallacy".&lt;ref name="MGL"&gt;{{cite book | first1=JD | last1=Heydon | first2=MJ | last2=Leeming | first3=PG | last3=Turner | title=Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane's Equity: Doctrine and Remedies | publisher=LexisNexis | edition=5th | date=2014 | isbn=9780409332254 | series=Trusts, Wills and Probate Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdictions which have inherited the common law system differ in their current treatment of equity. Over the course of the twentieth century some common law systems began to place less emphasis on the historical or institutional origin of substantive legal rules. In England, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, equity remains a distinct body of law. Modern equity includes, among other things:&lt;ref name="MGL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first=John | editor-last=McGhee | title=Snell's Equity | publisher=Sweet &amp; Maxwell | edition=33rd | isbn=9780414051607 | date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Fiduciary|Fiduciary law]];
* [[Estoppel|Equitable estoppel]] (including promissory and proprietary estoppel);
* Relief against [[Penalties in English law|penalties]] and relief against forfeiture;&lt;ref&gt;There is currently a divergence of opinion between the High Court of Australia and the Supreme Court of England on this point. In Australia, the continuing existence of the equitable jurisdiction to relieve against penalties has been confirmed: {{cite AustLII | litigants=Andrews v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited|HCA|30|2012|parallelcite=247 CLR 205}}. In England, this view was not adopted: {{cite BAILII | litigants=Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi |year=2015 | court=UKSC | num=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The doctrines of [[Contribution claim (legal)|contribution]], [[subrogation]] and [[Doctrine of marshalling|marshalling]]; and
* Equitable [[Set-off (law)|set-off]].

The latter part of the twentieth century saw increased debate over the utility of treating equity as a separate body of law. These debates were labelled the "fusion wars".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-first1=Simone | editor-last1=Degeling | editor-first2=James | editor-last2=Edelman | title=Equity in Commercial Law | publisher=Lawbook Co. | location=Sydney | date=October 2005 | isbn=0-455-22208-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burrows"&gt;For an example of the pro-fusionist view, see Andrew  Burrows, {{cite journal | title=We Do This At Common Law But That in Equity | first=Andrew | last=Burrows | date=1 March 2002 | volume=22 | issue=1 | journal=Oxford Journal of Legal Studies | pages=1–16 | doi=10.1093/ojls/22.1.1 | jstor=3600632 |  mode=cs2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A particular flashpoint in this debate centred on the concept of [[unjust enrichment]] and whether areas of law traditionally regarded as equitable could be rationalised as part of a single body of law known as the [[English unjust enrichment law|law of unjust enrichment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Peter | last=Birks | title=Unjust Enrichment | edition=2nd | date=13 January 2005 | series=Clarendon Law Series | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=9780199276981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Andrew | last=Burrows | title=The Law of Restitution | edition=3rd | date=2 December 2010 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=9780199296521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Graham | last=Virgo | title=The Principles of the Law of Restitution | edition=3rd | date=13 August 2015 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=9780198726388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] of England in the 11th century, royal justice came to be administered in three central courts: the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]], the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]], and the [[Exchequer of Pleas|Exchequer]]. The common law developed in these royal courts. To commence litigation in these royal courts, it was necessary to fit one's claim within a [[form of action]]. The plaintiff would purchase a writ in the [[Chancery (medieval office)|Chancery]], the head of which was the [[Lord Chancellor]]. If the law provided no remedy (or no efficacious remedy), litigants could sometimes appeal directly to the King. Eventually, the King would delegate resolution of these petitions to the King's Council. These petitions were eventually delegated to the Lord Chancellor himself.

In the early history of the United States, common law was viewed as a birthright. Both the individual states and the federal government supported common law after the American Revolution. U.S. courts draw on decisions of English courts, individual state courts, and federal courts in formulating common law.&lt;ref name="commonlaw.uslegal.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://commonlaw.uslegal.com/origins-of-common-law/ |title=The Origins of Common Law |publisher=US Legal, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergence of the Court of Chancery ===

By the 14th century it appears that Chancery was operating as a court, affording remedies for which the strict procedures of the common law worked injustice or provided no remedy to a deserving plaintiff. Chancellors often had theological and clerical training and were well versed in [[Roman law]] and [[canon law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Sarah | last=Worthington | title=Equity | series=Clarendon Law Series | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford University Press | date=12 October 2006 | isbn=0199290504 | pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 15th century the judicial power of Chancery was clearly recognised. Equity, as a body of rules, varied from Chancellor to Chancellor, until the end of the 16th century. After the end of the 17th century, only lawyers were appointed to the office of Chancellor. Over time, Equity developed a system of precedent much like its common-law cousin.

One area in which the Court of Chancery assumed a vital role was the enforcement of [[use (legal)|use]]s, a role that the rigid framework of [[English property law#Estates|land law]] could not accommodate. This role gave rise to the basic distinction between [[legal interest|legal]]{{disambiguation needed|date=July 2017}} and [[equitable interest]]s.

=== Development of equity in England ===

It was early provided that, in seeking to remove one who wrongfully entered another's land with force and arms, a person could allege disseisin (dispossession) and demand (and pay for) a [[Form of action|writ of entry]]. That writ gave him the written right to re-enter his own land and established this right under the protection of [[the Crown]] if need be, whence its value. In 1253, to prevent judges from inventing new writs, [[Parliament]] provided that the power to issue writs would thereafter be transferred to judges only one writ at a time, in a "writ for right" package known as a form of action.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} However, because it was limited to enumerated writs for enumerated rights and wrongs, the writ system sometimes produced unjust results. Thus, even though the King's Bench might have jurisdiction over a case and might have the power to issue the perfect writ, the plaintiff might still not have a case if there was not a single form of action combining them. Therefore, lacking a legal remedy, the plaintiff's only option would be petitioning the King.

People began petitioning the King for relief against unfair judgments, and as the number of petitioners rapidly grew, so the King delegated the task of hearing petitions to the Lord Chancellor. As the early Chancellors lacked formal legal training and showed little regard for precedent, their decisions were often widely diverse. In 1529, a lawyer, Sir [[Thomas More]], was appointed as Chancellor, marking the beginning of a new era. After this time, all future Chancellors were lawyers. Beginning around 1557, records of proceedings in the Courts of Chancery were kept and several equitable doctrines developed. Criticisms continued, the most famous being 17th-century jurist [[John Selden]]'s aphorism:&lt;blockquote&gt;Equity is a roguish thing: for law we have a measure, know what to trust to; equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is larger or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure we call a foot, a Chancellor's foot; what an uncertain measure would this be? One Chancellor has a long foot, another a short foot, a third an indifferent foot: 'tis the same thing in a Chancellor's conscience.&lt;ref&gt;J. Selden, ''Table Talk''; quoted in {{cite book | editor-first1=Michael | editor-last1=Evans | editor-first2=R Ian | editor-last2=Jack | title=Sources of English Legal and Constitutional History | publisher=Butterworths | location=Sydney | date=1984 | pages=223–224 | isbn=0409493821 | mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A criticism of Chancery practice as it developed in the early medieval period was that it lacked fixed rules and that the [[Lord Chancellor]] was exercising an unbounded discretion. The counter-argument was that Equity mitigated the rigour of the common law by looking to substance rather than to form.

Litigants would go '[[jurisdiction shopping]]' and often would seek an equitable [[injunction]] prohibiting the enforcement of a common law court order. The penalty for disobeying an equitable ‘common injunction’ and enforcing a common law judgment was imprisonment.

The Chief Justice of the [[King's Bench]], Sir [[Edward Coke]], began the practice of issuing writs of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' that required the release of people imprisoned for contempt of chancery orders.

This tension climaxed in the [[Earl of Oxford's case]] (1615) where a judgment of Chief Justice Coke was allegedly obtained by fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants=Earl of Oxford's Case | court=Court of Chancery | date=1615 | reporter=I Ch Rep I, 21 ER 485}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chancellor, [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Lord Ellesmere]], issued a common injunction from the Chancery prohibiting the enforcement of the common law order. The two courts became locked in a stalemate, and the matter was eventually referred to the [[Attorney-General]], Sir [[Francis Bacon]]. Sir Francis, by authority of [[James I of England|King James I]], upheld the use of the common injunction and concluded that in the event of any conflict between the common law and equity, equity would prevail. Equity's primacy in England was later enshrined in the Judicature Acts of the 1870s, which also served to fuse the courts of equity and the common law (although emphatically not the systems themselves) into one unified court system.

=== Ecclesiastical laws ===
Ecclesiastical laws are a branch of English law and were English laws that dealt with matters concerning the church, this was so that religion and law was differentiated. These laws are considered an unwritten law of England and cannot be withheld in the court of law. Ecclesiastical laws are not currently established in the U.S as Common law.&lt;ref name="commonlaw.uslegal.com"/&gt;

=== Statute of Uses 1535 ===

In order to avoid paying land taxes and other feudal dues, lawyers developed a primitive form of trust called ‘the use’ that enabled one person (who was not required to pay tax) to hold the legal title of the land for the use of another person. The effect of this trust was that the first person owned the land under the common law, but the second person had a right to use the land under the law of equity.

Henry VIII enacted the [[Statute of Uses]] in 1535 (which became effective in 1536) in an attempt to outlaw this practice and recover lost revenue. The Act effectively made the beneficial owner of the land the legal owner and therefore liable for feudal dues.

The response of the lawyers to this Statute was to create the 'use upon a use'. The Statute recognized only the first use, and so land owners were again able to separate the legal and beneficial interests in their land.

For an example, see Godwyne v. Profyt (after 1393): a petition to the Chancellor&lt;ref&gt;''Godwyne v. Profyt'' in {{cite book | title=Select Cases in Chancery: A.D. 1364 to 1471 | publisher=Selden Society | editor-first=Baildon | editor-last=William Paley | url= https://archive.org/stream/selectcasesincha00grearich#page/48/mode/2up | at=case 45 (after 1393) | mode=cs2 | date=1896}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===

Equity remains a cornerstone of Australian private law. A string of cases in the 1980s saw the [[High Court of Australia]] re-affirm the continuing vitality of traditional equitable doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite AustLII | litigants=Muschinski v Dodds|HCA|78|1985|parallelcite=160 CLR 583}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court has recently affirmed the importance of Equity and dismissed the suggestion that [[unjust enrichment]] has explanatory power in relation to traditional equitable doctrines such as [[subrogation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII | litigants=Bofinger v Kingsway |HCA|44|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of [[New South Wales]] is particularly well known for the strength of its Equity jurisprudence. However, it was only in 1972 with the introduction of reform to the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) that empowered both the Equity and Common Law Division of the Supreme Court of NSW to grant relief in either equity or common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU |NSW|act|sca1970183|Supreme Court Act 1970|44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 NSW also adopted one of the essential sections of the Judicature reforms, which emphasised that where there was a conflict between the common law and equity, equity would always prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU |NSW|act|lraea1972263|Law Reform (Law and Equity) Act 1972|5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in 1984 three alumni of [[Sydney Law School]] and judges of the NSW Supreme Court, [[Roderick Meagher]], [[William Gummow]]  and John Lehane produced ''[[Equity: Doctrines and Remedies|Equity: Doctrines &amp; Remedies]]''. It remains one of the most highly regarded practitioner texts in Australia and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants=Cukurova Finance International Ltd v Alfa Telecom Turkey Ltd | court=UKPC | num=20 | year=2013 | para=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII | litigants=Harris v Digital Pulse Pty Ltd |NSWCA|10|2003| parallelcite=56 NSWLR 298 | para=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is now in its 5th edition and edited by [[Dyson Heydon]], former Justice of the High Court, Justice Mark Leeming of the NSW Court of Appeal, and Dr Peter Turner of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name="MGL"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===

==== England and Wales ====

Equity remains a distinct part of the [[English law|law]] of [[England and Wales]]. The main challenge to it has come from academic writers working within the [[English unjust enrichment law|law of unjust enrichment]]. Scholars such as [[Peter Birks|Professor Birks]] and [[Andrew Burrows|Professor Burrows]] argue that in many cases the inclusion of the label "legal" or "equitable" before a substantive rule is often unnecessary.&lt;ref name="Burrows"/&gt; Many English universities, such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], continue to teach Equity as a standalone subject. Leading practitioner texts include ''Snell's Equity'', ''Lewin on Trusts'', and ''Hayton &amp; Underhill's Law of Trusts and Trustees''.

==== Scotland ====

The [[courts of Scotland]] have never recognised a division between the normal [[common law]] and equity, and as such the [[Court of Session]] (the [[supreme court|supreme]] [[civil law (common law)|civil court]] of [[Scotland]]) has exercised an equitable and [[inherent jurisdiction]] and  called the ''nobile officium''.&lt;ref name="thomson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomson |first=Stephen |year=2015 |title=''The Nobile Officium: The Extraordinary Equitable Jurisdiction of the Supreme Courts of Scotland''| location=Edinburgh| publisher=Avizandum | isbn=1904968333}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''nobile officium'' enables the Court to provide a [[legal remedy]] where [[statute]] or the [[common law]] are silent, and prevent mistakes in procedure or practice that would lead to [[injustice]]. The exercise of this power is limited by adherence to [[precedent]], and when [[Primary and secondary legislation|legislation]] or the common law already specify the relevant remedy. Thus, the Court cannot set aside a [[statutory power]], but can deal with situations where the law is silent, or where there is an omission in statute. Such an omission is sometimes termed a ''casus improvisus''.&lt;ref name="nobile_officium"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobileofficium.com/nobile-officium-used-to-recognise-english-high-court-orders-due-to-statutory-casus-improvisus/|title=Nobile officium used to recognise English High Court orders due to statutory casus improvisus {{!}} The Nobile Officium|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uwH8m1opGboJ:https://www.nobileofficium.com/nobile-officium-used-to-recognise-english-high-court-orders-due-to-statutory-casus-improvisus/+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk|archive-date=2 Apr 2017|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=J.

=== India ===

In [[India]] the [[common law]] doctrine of equity had traditionally been followed even after it became independent in 1947. However, in 1963 the [[Specific Relief Act 1963|"Specific Relief Act"]] was passed by the [[Parliament of India]] following the recommendation of the [[Law Commission of India]] and repealing the earlier "Specific Relief Act" of 1877. Under the 1963 Act, most equitable concepts were codified and made statutory rights, thereby ending the discretionary role of the courts to grant equitable reliefs. The rights codified under the 1963 Act were as under:
* Recovery of possession of immovable property (ss. 5–8)
* Specific performance of [[contract]]s (ss. 9–25)
* Rectification of Instruments (s. 26)
* Recession of Contracts (ss. 27–30)
* Cancellation of Instruments (ss. 31–33)
* Declaratory Decrees (ss. 34–35)
* [[Injunction]]s (ss. 36–42)

With this codification, the nature and tenure of the equitable reliefs available earlier have been modified to make them statutory rights and are also required to be pleaded specifically to be enforced. Further to the extent that these equitable reliefs have been codified into rights, they are no longer discretionary upon the courts or as the English law has it, "Chancellor's foot" but instead are enforceable rights subject to the conditions under the 1963 Act being satisfied. Nonetheless, in the event of situations not covered under the 1963 Act, the courts in India continue to exercise their [[Inherent Powers|inherent powers]] in terms of Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which applies to all [[civil court]]s in India.

There is no such inherent powers with the criminal courts in India except with the [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] in terms of Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Further, such inherent powers are vested in the [[Supreme Court of India]] in terms of Article 142 of the [[Constitution of India]] which confers wide powers on the Supreme Court to pass orders "as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause of matter pending before it".

=== United States ===

In modern practice, perhaps the most important distinction between law and equity is the set of remedies each offers. The most common civil remedy a court of law can award is monetary damages. Equity, however, enters injunctions or decrees directing someone either to act or to forbear from acting. Often, this form of relief is in practical terms more valuable to a litigant; for example, a plaintiff whose neighbor will not return his only milk cow, which had wandered onto the neighbor's property, may want that particular cow back, not just its monetary value. However, in general, a litigant cannot obtain equitable relief unless there is "no adequate remedy at law"; that is, a court will not grant an injunction unless monetary damages are an insufficient remedy for the injury in question. Law courts can also enter certain types of immediately enforceable orders, called "[[writ]]s" (such as a writ of [[habeas corpus]]), but they are less flexible and less easily obtained than an [[injunction]].

Another distinction is the unavailability of a jury in equity: the judge is the [[trier of fact]]. In the American legal system, the right of [[jury trial]] in civil cases tried in federal court is guaranteed by the [[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]] ''in Suits at common law'', cases that traditionally would have been handled by the law courts. The question of whether a case should be determined by a jury depends largely on the type of relief the plaintiff requests. If a plaintiff requests damages in the form of money or certain other forms of relief, such as the return of a specific item of property, the remedy is considered legal, and a jury is available as the fact-finder. On the other hand, if the plaintiff requests an [[injunction]], [[declaratory judgment]], [[specific performance]], modification of contract, or some other non-monetary relief, the claim would usually be one in equity.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] explained in 1785 that there are three main limitations on the power of a court of equity: "If the legislature means to enact an injustice, however palpable, the court of Chancery is not the body with whom a correcting power is lodged. That it shall not interpose in any case which does not come within a general description and admit of redress by a general and practicable rule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite letter | url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-09-02-0056 | first=Thomas | last=Jefferson | recipient=Phillip Mazzei | subject=To Philip Mazzei | date=November 1785}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Supreme Court, however, has concluded that courts have wide discretion to fashion relief in cases of equity. The first major statement of this power came in ''[[Willard v. Tayloe]]'', 75 U.S. 557 (1869). The Court concluded that "relief is not a matter of absolute right to either party; it is a matter resting in the discretion of the court, to be exercised upon a consideration of all the circumstances of each particular case."&lt;ref name="Willard565"&gt;{{cite court | litigants=Willard v. Tayloe | date=1869 | reporter={{law report |75|U.S.|557}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Willard v. Tayloe'' was for many years the leading case in [[contract]] law regarding intent and enforcement.&lt;ref name="Dawson32"&gt;{{cite journal | first=John P. | last=Dawson | title=Judicial Revision of Frustrated Contracts: The United States | journal=Boston University Law Review | volume=64 | issue=1 | date=January 1984 | page=32 | url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/bulr64&amp;div=9&amp;start_page=1&amp;collection=journals | subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Events Subsequent to the Contract As a Defence to Specific Performance | journal=Columbia Law Review | volume=16 | issue=5 | date=May 1916 | page=411 | jstor=1110409}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as equity.&lt;ref name="Dawson32"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Renner"&gt;{{cite book | first=Shirley | last=Renner | title=Inflation and the Enforcement of Contracts | location=Cheltenham, England | publisher=Elgar | date=1999 | page=20 | series=New Horizons in Law and Economics | isbn=978-1-84064-062-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States today, the federal courts and most state courts have merged law and equity in the courts of general jurisdiction, such as county courts. However, the substantive distinction between law and equity has retained its old vitality.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite court | litigants=Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc. | reporter={{law report|547|US|356}} | year=2006}} (Roberts, C.J. for a unanimous court) (reviewing the scope of equitable relief as authorized by the ERISA statute).&lt;/ref&gt; This difference is not a mere technicality, because the successful handling of certain law cases is difficult or impossible unless a temporary restraining order (TRO) or preliminary injunction is issued at the outset, to restrain someone from fleeing the jurisdiction taking the only property available to satisfy a judgment, for instance. Furthermore, certain statutes like [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] specifically authorize ''only'' equitable relief, which forces US courts to analyze in lengthy detail whether the relief demanded in particular cases brought under those statutes would have been available in equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants=Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson | reporter={{law report|534|US|204}} | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Equity courts were widely distrusted in the northeastern US following the American Revolution. A serious movement for merger of law and equity began in the states in the mid-19th century, when [[David Dudley Field II]] convinced New York State to adopt what became known as the [[Field Code]] of 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Douglas | last=Laycock | title=Modern American Remedies: Cases and materials | edition=3rd | publisher=Aspen Press | year=2002 | page=370 | isbn=0735524696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Kellen | last=Funk | title=Equity without Chancery: The Fusion of Law and Equity in the Field Code of Civil Procedure, New York 1846–76 | journal=Journal of Legal History | date=2015 | pages=152–191 | doi=10.1080/01440365.2015.1047560 | volume=36 | issue=2 | ssrn=2600201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal courts did not abandon the old law/equity separation until the promulgation of the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] in 1938.

Today three states still have separate courts for law and equity; the most notable is [[Delaware]], whose [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]] is where most cases involving [[Delaware corporation]]s are decided.&lt;ref&gt;The other two are [[Courts of Mississippi|Mississippi]] and [[Courts of Tennessee|Tennessee]]. Sources that mention four states (i.e., Laycock 2002) generally include [[Courts of Arkansas|Arkansas]], which abolished its separate chancery courts as of January 1, 2002. {{cite web|url=http://courts.state.ar.us/circuitcourt/index.cfm |accessdate=July 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804025412/http://courts.state.ar.us/circuitcourt/index.cfm |archivedate=August 4, 2011 | title=Circuit Court | publisher=Arkansas Judiciary | mode=cs2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, merger in some states is less than complete; some other states (such as Illinois and [[New Jersey]]) have separate divisions for legal and equitable matters in a single court.  Virginia had separate law and equity dockets (in the same court) until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, Rule 3:1; W.H. Bryson, "[https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.bing.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1068&amp;context=law-faculty-publications The Merger of Common-Law and Equity Pleading in Virginia]", University of Richmond Law Review 41:77-82 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[corporate law]], which developed out of the [[Trust law|law of trusts]], areas traditionally handled by chancery courts included [[Will (law)|wills]] and [[probate]], [[adoption]]s and [[guardianship]]s, and [[marriage]] and [[divorce]]. [[Bankruptcy]] was also historically considered an equitable matter; although [[bankruptcy in the United States]] is today a purely federal matter, reserved entirely to the [[United States Bankruptcy Courts]] by the enactment of the [[United States Bankruptcy Code]] in 1978, bankruptcy courts are still officially considered "courts of equity" and exercise equitable powers under Section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hawes|first1=Lesley Anne|title=Another Conflict in the Circuits Brewing Over Bankruptcy Court's Equitable Powers Under §105(a)|url=http://www.abfjournal.com/articles/another-conflict-in-the-circuits-brewing-over-bankruptcy-courts-equitable-powers-under-%C2%A7105a/|website=ABF Journal|accessdate=18 June 2015|date=January–February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After US courts merged law and equity, American law courts adopted many of the procedures of equity courts. The procedures in a court of equity were much more flexible than the courts at common law. In American practice, certain devices such as [[joinder]], [[counterclaim]], [[cross-claim]] and [[interpleader]] originated in the courts of equity. Also, the modern [[class action]] evolved out of the equitable doctrine of virtual representation, which enabled a court of equity to fully dispose of an estate even though it might contain contingent interests held by persons over which the court did not have direct jurisdiction.

{{refimprove|date=January 2013}}
'''Financial intelligence''' ('''FININT''') is the gathering of information about the financial affairs of entities of interest, to understand their nature and capabilities, and predict their intentions.  Generally the term applies in the context of  law enforcement  and related activities.

One of the main purposes of financial intelligence is to identify [[financial transaction]]s that may involve [[tax evasion]], [[money laundering]] or some other criminal activity. FININT may also be involved in identifying financing of criminal and terrorist organisations.

Financial intelligence can be broken down into two main areas, collection and analysis.   Collection is normally done by a government agency, known as a financial intelligence organisation or Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).  The agency will collect raw transactional information and [[Suspicious activity report]]s (SAR) usually provided by banks and other entities as part of regulatory requirements.  Data may be shared with other countries through intergovernmental networks.  

Analysis, may consist of scrutinizing a large volume of transactional data using [[data mining]] or data-matching techniques to identify persons potentially engaged in a particular activity.  SARs can also be scrutinized and linked with other data to try and identify specific activity.

==Collection==
FININT involves scrutinizing a large volume of transactional data, usually provided by banks and other entities as part of regulatory requirements. Alternatively, [[data mining]] or data-matching techniques may be employed to identify persons potentially engaged in a particular activity.

Many industrialized countries have regulatory reporting requirements for its financial organisations. 

It may be possible for the FININT organization to obtain access to raw data at a financial organization. From a legal standpoint, this type of collection can be quite complex. For example, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] obtained access to the [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] (SWIFT) data streams through the [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]], but this violated Belgian privacy law.  

Reporting requirements may not affect [[Informal value transfer system]]s (IVTS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fincen.gov/advis33.pdf |author=United States Department of the Treasury, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network |title=Informal Value Transfer Systems, FinCEN Advisory Issue 33 |date=March 2003 |id=FinCEN-2003-33 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121142607/http://www.fincen.gov/advis33.pdf |archivedate=November 21, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of which may simply be customary in a culture, and of amounts that would not require reporting if in a conventional financial institution. IVTS also can be used for criminal purposes of avoiding oversight.

==Analysis==
Examples of financial intelligence analysis could include:
* Identifying high-[[risk]] housing tenants on the basis of past rental histories.
* Detecting tax payers trying to avoid their fiduciary obligations by moving wealth surreptitiously out of a tax-levying jurisdiction.
* Discovering [[tax haven|safe havens]] where criminals park the proceeds of [[crime]].
* Accounting for how a large sum of money handed to a targeted individual disappears
* Checking to see if a corrupt individual has had any sudden and unexplained windfalls.
* Detecting relationships between [[terrorist]] cells through remittances.

==Financial intelligence organizations==
According to the [[Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units]], financial intelligence organizations (FIUs) are national centres which collect information on suspicious or unusual financial activity from the financial industry and other entities or professions required to report transactions suspicious of being money laundering or terrorism financing. FIUs are normally not law enforcement agencies; their mission being to process and analyze the information received. If sufficient evidence of unlawful activity is found, the matter is passed to the public prosecution.&lt;ref name=Egmont&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an FIU?|url=http://www.egmontgroup.org/|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government organizations may simply receive and process raw financial reports, and forward them, as appropriate, to law enforcement or intelligence agencies, include the multinational Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, and national organizations, including:

* [[Argentina]] – [[Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera]] 
* [[Australia]] – [[Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre]] (AUSTRAC)
* [[Brazil]] – [[Council for Financial Activities Control|COAF]] Conselho de Controle de Atividade Financeira
* [[Canada]] – [[Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada]] (FINTRAC)
* [[France]] – [[Tracfin]]
* [[Germany]] – [[Zentralstelle für Finanztransaktionsuntersuchungen]]
* [[India]] – [[Financial Intelligence Unit]] (FIU-IND)&lt;ref&gt;[http://fiuindia.gov.in/index.htm FIUindia.gov.in]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ireland]] – [[National Economic Crime Bureau|Garda Financial Intelligence Unit]] (GNECB FIU)
* [[United Kingdom]] – [[National Crime Agency]]
* [[United States]] – [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN)

== United States examples ==
The United States has different organizations focused on domestic and international financial activity.
The United States has several laws requiring the reporting to the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|FinCEN]]. These include the [[Right to Financial Privacy Act]] (RFPA) of 1978, the [[Bank Secrecy Act]] of 1970 (and other names of revisions), and the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] of 1999 (GLBA). Some reports also need to go to the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]].

For example, the reports
{| class="wikitable"
&lt;Caption&gt;Representative Reports required from US financial institutions&lt;/caption&gt;
|-
! Report and definition
! Authority
! Receiving Agency
|-
| '''Currency Transaction Report (CTR)'''. Cash transactions in excess of $10,000 during the same business day. The amount over $10,000 can be either from one transaction or a combination of cash transactions.
| Bank Secrecy Act
| Internal Revenue Service
|-
| '''Negotiable Instrument Log (NIL)'''.	Cash purchases of negotiable instruments (e.g., money orders, cashiers checks, travelers cheques) having a face value of $3,000, or more.
| Bank Secrecy Act
| Internal Revenue Service
|-
|'''Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)'''.	Any cash transaction where the customer seems to be trying to avoid BSA reporting requirements (e.g., CTR, NIL). A SAR must also be filed if the customer's actions indicate that s/he is laundering money or otherwise violating federal criminal law. The customer must not know that a SAR is being filed.
| Bank Secrecy Act
| Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
|}

Actions that can trigger an SAR being filed include:
:#Any kind of insider abuse of a financial institution, involving any amount;
:#Federal crimes against, or involving transactions conducted through, a financial institution that the financial institution detects and that involve at least $5,000 if  a suspect can be identified, or at least $25,000 regardless of whether a suspect can be identified;
:#Transactions of at least $5,000 that the institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect involve funds from illegal activities or are structured to attempt to hide those funds;
:#Transactions of at least $5,000 that the institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect are designed to evade any regulations promulgated under the Bankruptcy Secrecy Act; or
:#Transactions of at least $5,000 that the institution knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect have no business or apparent lawful purpose or are not the sort  in which the particular customer would normally be expected to engage and for which the institution knows of no reasonable explanation after due investigation.  The language of the RFPA indicates that a SAR filed under this rule comes from an individual transaction, not a profile of activities that make the transaction stand out.

===International===
International financial activity comes primarily from the Department of the Treasury and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. See [[CIA activities in Russia and Europe#Belgium 2006|CIA access]] to the [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] (SWIFT).

===US domestic FININT===
At the highest level, US domestic FININT, and also some international work, comes under the [[Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence]], heading the Office of Terrorism and Financial Analysis, including:
*[[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]]: tracks domestic transactions
*[[Office of Foreign Assets Control]]: focused on foreign assets in the US
*Office of Intelligence and Analysis

Information developed by these units, when related to domestic security and especially when state and local law enforcement, is disseminated by the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) in the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]], under the [[Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis]]. This Office is not restricted to FININT, but handles collection, analysis and fusion of intelligence throughout the entire Department. It disseminates intelligence throughout the Department, to the other members of the [[United States Intelligence Community]], and to affected [[first responder]]s at the state and local level.

Depending on the specific Federal violation, law enforcement investigation may be under agencies including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[United States Secret Service]], or the [[Internal Revenue Service]].

==Terrorist financing scenarios==

===Gems as an untraceable currency and source of income for terrorists===
Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] an allegation was made in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that [[tanzanite]] stones were being used as an untraceable currency and source of income for terrorists.  This has not since been firmly established.  See [[CIA Activities by Transnational Topic: Crime and Illicit Drug Trade#Conflict diamonds and militant financing|possible examples]].&lt;ref name=Farah2003&gt;{{cite web
| title = The Role of Conflict Diamonds and Failed States in the Terrorist Financial Structure
| author = Farah, Douglas
| publisher = The Watson Institute, Brown University
| date = 2003-10-24
| url = http://www.douglasfarah.com/articles/conflict-diamonds.shtml
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The custom common in Africa, uncut diamonds tend to be the de facto standard currency of the illicit small arms trade.  Diamonds may be easily counted with a uniform valuation per carat to people in places of the world where there are no automated teller machines.  An entire briefcase filled with uncut diamonds without the serial numbers found on refined precious metals can be used to make large illicit value transfers.  The practice coexists with human trafficking, narcotics, weapons dealing, terrorism, and the evasion of economic sanctions and embargoes.

However, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] has since instituted new [[anti-money laundering]] regulations to control the gem trade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=154465,00.html "New Requirement for the Precious Metal, Precious Stone, and Jewel Industries"], irs.gov.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213202653/https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0%2C%2Cid%3D154465%2C00.html |date=December 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Front-running the market in a terrorist attack===
Another intriguing possibility is that a terrorist might buy stocks which are likely to appreciate in the event of a terrorist attack, such as defense industry stocks, or sell short stocks which are likely to depreciate, such as airlines.  This possibility led to many investigations of the financial markets subsequent to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/chi-0109190296sep19,0,3496437.story "Terrorist trade probe widens: Options buying rose in firms that attack affected", by Robert Manor and Melissa Allison, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'',  September 19, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Financial Intelligence Unit Network ==
The Financial Intelligence Unit Network (FIU.NET) is a decentralized computer network that provides an information exchange between the financial intelligence units of the European Union.&lt;ref name="Van Duynen"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Georgios A. Antonopoulos |author2=Marc Groenhuijsen |author3=Jackie Harvey |author4=Tijs Kooijmans |author5=Almir Maljevic |author6=Klaus Von Lampe |title=Usual and Unusual Organising Criminals in Europe and Beyond: Profitable Crimes, from Underworld to Upper World: Liber Amicorum Petrus Van Duyne|year=2011|publisher=Maklu|location=Netherlands |isbn=978-90-466-0429-8 |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=M7oV39ilah0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIU.NET is a decentralized system with no central database where the information is collected. All the connected FIUs have their FIU.NET equipment within their own premises and manage their own information. Through FIU.NET the connected FIUs create bilateral or multilateral cases. Ma&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;tch (autonomous, anonymous, analysis) is a matching tool within FIU.NET. Ma&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;tch makes it possible for FIUs to match names in order to find relevant data that is possessed by other connected FIUs. As the data is anonymized, there is no breaching of privacy and data protection rules.

===Connected FIUs===
FIU.NET is funded by the European Commission and participating FIUs.&lt;ref name="DG HOME"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fundings|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/home-affairs/financing/fundings/projects/stories/fiu_net_en.htm|work=European Commission|publisher=European Commission - DG Home Affairs (HOME)|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the connected EU Member State FIUs are:&lt;ref name="FIU.NET website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Parties involved|url=http://www.fiu.net/home/parties-involved|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Slovenia, Slovakia, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

===Governing body===
FIU.NET is governed by a Board of Partners (BoP) formed by connected FIUs that have volunteered for a seat. The Board of Partners is chaired by an independent Director.&lt;ref name="House of Lords"&gt;{{cite book|title=Money laundering and the financing of terrorism: 19th report of session 2008-09, Vol. 2: Evidence|year=2009|publisher=UK- Parliament; House of Lords - The Stationery Office|location=United Kingdom|pages=254–255|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_DV2BA5jzksC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780108444692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project management===
Daily operation of the system is managed by the FIU.NET Bureau, a project bureau of the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice, which is housed in the [[Europol International]] Headquarters in [[The Hague]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9213">'''Geons''' are the simple 2D or 3D forms such as [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinders]], [[brick]]s, [[Wedge (geometry)|wedge]]s, [[Cone (geometry)|cones]], [[circles]] and [[rectangle]]s corresponding to the simple parts of an object in [[Irving Biederman|Biederman's]] [[recognition-by-components theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.94.2.115 |title=Recognition-by-components: A theory of human image understanding |year=1987 |last1=Biederman |first1=Irving |journal=Psychological Review |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=115–47 |pmid=3575582}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory proposes that the visual input is matched against structural representations of objects in the [[brain]]. These structural representations consist of geons and their relations (e.g., an [[ice cream cone]] could be broken down into a [[sphere]] located above a [[cone (geometry)|cone]]). Only a modest number of geons (&lt; 40) are assumed. When combined in different relations to each other (e.g., on-top-of, larger-than, end-to-end, end-to-middle) and coarse metric variation such as aspect ratio and 2D orientation, billions of possible 2- and 3-geon objects can be generated. Two classes of shape-based visual identification that are not done through geon representations, are those involved in: a) distinguishing between similar faces, and b) classifications that don’t have definite boundaries, such as that of  bushes or a crumpled garment.  Typically, such identifications are not viewpoint-invariant.

==Properties of geons==
[[File:Geons.png|thumb|150px|right|Two cases of two interrelated geons, What does the reader imagine in each case?]]
There are 4 essential properties of geons:
#View-invariance: Each geon can be distinguished from the others from almost any viewpoints except for “accidents” at highly restricted angles in which one geon projects an image that could be a different geon, as, for example, when an end-on view of a cylinder can be a sphere or circle. Objects represented as an arrangement of geons would, similarly, be viewpoint invariant.
#Stability or resistance to visual noise: Because the geons are simple, they are readily supported by the Gestalt property of smooth continuation, rendering their identification robust to partial occlusion and degradation by visual noise as, for example, when a cylinder might be viewed behind a bush.
#Invariance to illumination direction and surface markings and texture.
#High distinctiveness:  The geons differ qualitatively, with only two or three levels of an attributes, such as straight vs. curved, parallel vs. non parallel, positive vs. negative curvature. These qualitative differences can be readily distinguished thus rendering the geons readily distinguishable and the objects so composed, readily distinguishable.

==Derivation of invariant properties of geons==
'''Viewpoint invariance:'''  The viewpoint invariance of geons derives from their being distinguished by three nonaccidental properties (NAPs) of contours that do not change with orientation in depth:

#Whether the contour is straight or curved,
#The vertex that is formed when two or three contours coterminate (that is, end together at the same point), in the image, i.e., an L (2 contours), fork (3 contours with all angles &lt; 180°), or an arrow (3 contours, with one angle &gt; 180°), and
#Whether a pair of contours is parallel or not (with allowance for perspective).  When not parallel, the contours can be straight (converging or diverging) or curved, with positive or negative curvature forming a convex or concave, envelope, respectively (see Figure below).

[[File:Geon2.png|thumb|left]]

NAPs can be distinguished from metric properties (MPs), such as the degree of non-zero curvature of a contour or its length, which do vary with changes in orientation in depth.

===Invariance to lighting direction and surface characteristics===
Geons can be determined from the contours that mark the edges at orientation and depth discontinuities of an image of an object, i.e., the contours that specify a good line drawing of the object’s shape or volume. Orientation discontinuities define those edges where there is a sharp change in the orientation of the normal to the surface of a volume, as occurs at the contour at the boundaries of the different sides of a brick.  A depth discontinuity is where the observer’s line of sight jumps from the surface of an object to the background (i.e., is tangent to the surface), as occurs at the sides of a cylinder.  The same contour might mark both an orientation and depth discontinuity, as with the back edge of a brick. Because the geons are based on these discontinuities, they are invariant to variations in the direction of lighting, shadows, and surface texture and markings.

==Geons and generalized cones==
The geons constitute a partition of the set of generalized cones,&lt;ref&gt;Nevatia, R. (1982) Machine Perception.  Prentice-Hall.{{page needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are the volumes created when a cross section is swept along an axis.  For example, a circle swept along a straight axis would define a cylinder (see Figure).  A rectangle swept along a straight axis would define a "brick" (see Figure).  Four dimensions with contrastive values (i.e., mutually exclusive values) define the current set of geons (see Figure):
# Shape of cross section: round vs. straight. For example, as stated above, a rectangle swept along a straight axis would define a "brick" and the cross section would be straight.
#Axis:  straight vs. curved.
#Size of cross-section as it is swept along an axis:  constant vs. expanding (or contracting) vs. expanding then contracting vs. contracting then expanding. The cross section size of a "brick" would be constant.
#Termination of geon with constant sized cross-sections:  truncated vs. converging to a point vs. rounded.

These variations in the generating of geons create shapes that differ in NAPs.

==Experimental tests of the viewpoint invariance of geons==
There is now considerable support for the major assumptions of geon theory (See [[Recognition-by-components theory]]). One issue that generated some discussion was the finding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0096-1523.19.6.1162 |url=http://geon.usc.edu/~biederman/publications/Biederman_Gerhardstein_1993.pdf |title=Recognizing depth-rotated objects: Evidence and conditions for three-dimensional viewpoint invariance |year=1993 |last1=Biederman |first1=Irving |last2=Gerhardstein |first2=Peter C. |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=1162–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the geons were viewpoint invariant with little or no cost in the speed or accuracy of recognizing or matching a geon from an orientation in depth not previously experienced.  Some studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/1089 |year=1998 |last1=Tarr |first1=Michael J. |last2=Williams |first2=Pepper |last3=Hayward |first3=William G. |last4=Gauthier |first4=Isabel |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=275–7 |pmid=10195159 |title=Three-dimensional object recognition is viewpoint dependent}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported modest costs in matching geons at new orientations in depth but these studies had several methodological shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=2885–99 |doi=10.1016/S0042-6989(98)00309-5 |title=One-shot viewpoint invariance in matching novel objects |year=1999 |last1=Biederman |first1=I |journal=Vision Research |volume=39 |issue=17 |pmid=10492817 |last2=Bar |first2=M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=707–24 |doi=10.1068/p2953 |title=Imperfect invariance to object translation in the discrimination of complex shapes |year=2001 |last1=Dill |first1=Marcus |last2=Edelman |first2=Shimon |journal=Perception |volume=30 |issue=6 |pmid=11464559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research on geons==
There is much research out about geons and how they are interpreted. An important study happening now{{when?|date=May 2017}} is one that is looking at how the scrambling of geons impacts image recognition in pigeons. Kim Kirkpatrick-Steger, Edward A. Wasserman and Irving Biederman are conducting this research and have found that the individual geons along with their spatial composition are important in recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0097-7403.24.1.34 |title=Effects of Geon Deletion, Scrambling, and Movement on Picture Recognition in Pigeons |year=1998 |last1=Biederman |first1=Irving |last2=Kirkpatrik-Steger |first2=Kim |last3=Wasserman |first3=Edward |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=34–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the findings in this research seem to indicate that non-accidental sensitivity can be found in all shape discriminating species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0097-7403.24.1.34 |title=Effects of Geon Deletion, Scrambling, and Movement on Picture Recognition in Pigeons |year=1998 |last1=Biederman |first1=Irving |last2=Kirkpatrik-Steger |first2=Kim |last3=Wasserman |first3=Edward |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=34–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6574">'''Haptic perception''' ({{lang-gr|haptόs|script=latn|italics=yes}} "palpable", ''haptikόs'' "suitable for touch") means literally the ability "to grasp something". [[Perception]] in this case is achieved through the active exploration of surfaces and objects by a moving subject, as opposed to passive contact by a static subject during ''tactile perception''.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, E. H. (1851). ''Die Lehre vom Tastsinne und Gemeingefühle auf Versuche gegründet''. Friedrich Vieweg und Sohn.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Haptik'' was coined by the German Psychologist [[Max Dessoir]] in 1892, when suggesting a name for academic research into the sense of touch in the style of that in "acoustics" and "optics".&lt;ref&gt;Dessoir, M. (1892). ''Über den Hautsinn''. Arch. f. Anat. u. Physiol., Physiol. Abt., 175–339.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, M. &amp; John, M. (2008). German pioneers of research into human haptic perception. In M. Grunwald (Ed.), ''Human Haptic Perception'' (pp. 15-39). Basel, Boston, Berlin: Birkhäuser.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson (1966)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibson |first=J.J. |year=1966 |title=The senses considered as perceptual systems. |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=0-313-23961-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined the haptic system as "[t]he sensibility of the individual to the world adjacent to his body by use of his body". Gibson and others further emphasized what Weber had realized in 1851:  the close link between haptic perception and body movement, and that haptic perception is active exploration.

The concept of haptic perception is related to the concept of [[extended physiological proprioception]], according to which when a tool such as a stick is used, perceptual experience is transparently transferred to the end of the tool.

Haptic perception relies on the forces experienced during touch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roblesdelatorre.com/gabriel/GR-VH-Nature2001.pdf Robles-De-La-Torre &amp; Hayward. Force Can Overcome Object Geometry In the perception of Shape Through Active Touch. Nature 412 (6845):445-8 (2001).]&lt;/ref&gt; This research allows the creation of "virtual", illusory haptic shapes with different perceived qualities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17363&amp;ch=biotech&amp;sc=&amp;pg=1 "The Cutting edge of haptics"]&lt;/ref&gt; which has clear application in [[haptic technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfh.org/GR-Principles_Haptic_Percept_VE.pdf Robles-De-La-Torre G. Principles of Haptic Perception in Virtual Environments. In Grunwald M (Ed.), ''Human Haptic Perception'', Birkhäuser Verlag, 2008.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726191736/http://www.isfh.org/GR-Principles_Haptic_Percept_VE.pdf |date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exploratory procedures ==

People can rapidly and accurately identify three-dimensional objects by touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klatzky RL, Lederman SJ, Metzger VA |year=1985 |title=Identifying objects by touch: An "expert system." |journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics |issue = 4 |pages=299–302 |doi=10.3758/BF03211351 |volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They do so through the use of exploratory procedures, such as moving the fingers over the outer surface of the object or holding the entire object in the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lederman SJ, Klatzky RL |year=1987 |title=Hand movements: A window into haptic object recognition |journal=Cognitive Psychology |issue=3 |pages=342–368 |pmid=3608405 |volume=19 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(87)90008-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following exploratory procedures have been identified so far:
#Lateral motion
#Pressure
#Enclosure
#Contour following
Thus gathered object or subject properties are size, weight, contour, surface and material characteristics, consistency and temperature.

== Impairments of haptic sensitivity ==

Haptic sensitivity can be impaired by a multitude of diseases and disorders, predominantly relating to [[skin]] injuries (incisions, burns, etc) and [[nerve]] lesions (through injury or impaired [[circulatory system|circulation]]). Additionally, loss of sensitivity ([[neuropathy]]) may be caused by [[metabolic]], [[toxic]] and/or [[Immune system|immunologic]] factors. Examples of medical conditions that can cause neuropathies are [[diabetes mellitus]], [[chronic kidney disease]], thyroid dysfunction (hyper- and [[hypothyroidism]]) as well as [[hepatitis]], [[liver cirrhosis]] and [[alcohol dependency]].

Loss of the sense of touch is a catastrophic deficit that can impair walking and other skilled actions such as holding objects or using tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3216">An '''honest broker''' is an entity that keeps sets of private information but distributes parts of those sets to other entities who should not have access to the entire set. Honest brokers often work in [[clinical research]] with [[biological specimens]]; in that case, donors of specimens allow researchers to do research on those specimens, but typically want their specimen [[de-identification|de-identified]] by having [[protected health information]] separated from it. The honest broker would keep both the specimen and associated protected health information, but only allow researchers to have access to the specimen without the protected health information.

==Characteristics ==
Honest brokers are typically appointed to a research project by an [[institutional review board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Auray-Blais | first1 = C. | last2 = Patenaude | first2 = J. | journal = BMC Medical Ethics | volume = 7 | pages = 4 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6939-7-4 | pmid =  16600040|title=A biobank management model applicable to biomedical research| pmc = 1475589}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide data from clinical and research sources for research use only and in accordance with policies that prohibit re-identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dhir | first1 = R. | last2 = Patel | first2 = A. A. | last3 = Winters | first3 = S. | last4 = Bisceglia | first4 = M. | last5 = Swanson | first5 = D. | last6 = Aamodt | first6 = R. | last7 = Becich | first7 = M.

Organizations conducting [[breast cancer]] research have identified access to biological specimens as a top priority, and therefore honest broker systems are key to research because they increase access to specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Taube | first1 = S.

==Diplomacy==
In Diplomacy, an "honest broker" is an entity (individual or organisation) that is accepted by all sides in a negotiation as impartial. Neutrality does not equal an absence of interest; rather, the interest of the honest broker lies in a solution, without preference for either party involved in the conflict.

German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] was the first to use the term (applied to himself) in connection with the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]].&lt;ref name="washingtoninstitute.org"&gt;The Washington Institute for Near East Policy: [http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-united-states-as-an-honest-broker The United States as an Honest Broker - The Washington Institute for Near East Policy], accessdate: May 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US Army 52300 "Tell Me A Story" promotes academic, emotional connections.jpg|thumb|right|alt= A parent and child engage in joint attention.|A parent and child engage in joint attention]]
'''Joint attention''' or '''shared attention''' is the shared focus of two individuals on an object. It is achieved when one individual alerts another to an object by means of [[eye gaze|eye-gazing]], [[pointing]] or other verbal or non-verbal indications. An individual gazes at another individual, points to an object and then returns their gaze to the individual. Scaife and Bruner were the first researchers to present a [[cross-sectional]] description of children's ability to follow eye gaze in 1975. They found that most eight- to ten-month-old children followed a line of regard, and that all 11- to 14-month-old children did so. This early research showed it was possible for an adult to bring certain objects in the environment to an infant's [[attention]] using eye gaze.&lt;ref name="Moore&amp;Dunham"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=C.|last2=Dunham |first2=P |title= Joint Attention: Its Origins and Role in Development |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1995 |isbn=0-8058-1437-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent research demonstrates that two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying [[intention]]. The ability to share gaze with another individual is an important skill in establishing [[reference]]. The ability to identify intention is important in a child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of [[language development]] including [[language comprehension|comprehension]], [[Language production|production]] and [[Vocabulary development|word learning]]. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development and the ability to take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. The ability to establish joint attention may be negatively affected by [[deafness]], [[blindness]], and developmental disorders such as [[autism]].

Other animals such as [[great ape]]s, [[orangutan]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s, [[dog]]s, and [[horse]]s also show some elements of joint attention.

== Humans ==

=== Levels of joint attention ===
Defining levels of joint attention is important in determining if children are engaging in age-appropriate joint attention. There are three levels of joint attention: triadic, dyadic, and shared gaze.

Triadic joint attention is the highest level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that there is an element of shared attention.&lt;ref name="Reddy" /&gt; For an instance of social engagement to count as triadic joint attention it requires at least two individuals attending to an object or focusing their attention on each other.&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hobson |first1=R.P. |editor-first=J |editor-last=Roessler |title=Joint attention: Communication and other minds |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |pages=185–204|isbn=0-19-924563-0 |chapter=What puts the jointness in joint attention?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the individual must display awareness that focus is shared between himself or herself and another individual.&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Triadic attention is marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.

Dyadic joint attention is a conversation-like behavior that individuals engage in. This is especially true for human adults and infants, who engage in this behavior starting at two months of age.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Adults and infants take turns exchanging facial expressions, noises, and in the case of the adult, speech.

Shared gaze occurs when two individuals are simply looking at an object.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Okamoto-Barth |first1=S.|last2=Tomonaga |first2=M. |editor-first=M. |editor-last=Tanaka |title= Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2006 |pages=155–171|isbn=4-431-30246-8 |chapter=Development of Joint Attention in Infant Chimpanzees}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shared gaze is the lowest level of joint attention.

Individuals who engage in triadic joint attention must understand both gaze and intention to establish common reference. Gaze refers to a child's understanding of the link between mental activity and the physical act of seeing. Intention refers to the child's ability to understand the goal of another person's mental processes.

=== Gaze ===
[[File:Click Here. No, Here.jpg|thumb|right|alt= A parent and child engage in joint attention through pointing.|A parent and child engage in joint attention through [[List of gestures#Single hand gestures|pointing]]]]
For an individual to engage in joint attention they must establish [[reference]].&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; Following the gaze or directive actions (such as pointing) of others is a common way of establishing reference.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; For an individual to understand that following gaze establishes reference the individual must display:
* Recognition that looking is intentional behavior directed to external objects and events. Following gaze serves the purpose of establishing reference.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"&gt;D'Entremont, B., Yazbeck, A., Morgan, A. &amp; MacAulay, S. (2007). Early gaze-following and the understanding of others. In R. Flomm, K. Lee &amp; D. Muir (Eds.), ''Gaze-Following: Its Development and Significance'' (pp. 77–94). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-19-924563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An understanding that looking results in the mental experience of seeing an object or event.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt;
* Recognition that eyes are responsible for seeing.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt;
* Recognition that others share in the capacity to see things.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt;
* An understanding that voice direction helps determine whether the speaker is talking to them and what he or she is referring to or focused on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rossano|first=Federico |author2=Malinda Carpenter |author3=Michael Tomasello|title=One-Year-Old Infants Follow Others’ Voice Direction|journal=Psychological Science|year=2012|pages=1298–1302|doi=10.1177/0956797612450032|volume=23|pmid=23070306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaze becomes more complex with age and practice.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt; As gaze increases in complexity, individuals are better able to discriminate what others are referring to.&lt;ref name="Heal2005" /&gt; Joint attention is also important for social learning. Gaze following reflects an expectation-based type of orienting in which an individual's attention is cued by another's head turn or eye turn.&lt;ref name="MacPherson"/&gt; Individuals are motivated to follow another's gaze and engage in joint attention because gaze is a cue for which rewarding events occur.&lt;ref name="MacPherson"/&gt;

=== Intention ===
The ability to identify [[intention]] is critical to joint attention. When individuals understand that others have goals, intentions, and attentional states, they are able to enter into and direct another's attention.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; Joint attention promotes and maintains dyadic exchanges and learning about the nature of social partners.&lt;ref name= "D'Entremont"/&gt; The ability to engage in joint attention is crucial for language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tomasello | first1 = M. | last2 = Farrar | first2 = J. | year = 1986 | title = Joint attention and early language | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 1454–1463 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1986.tb00470.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, D.A. (1995). Understanding the link between joint attention and language. In C. Moore &amp; P.J. Dunham (Eds.) ''Joint attention: Its origins and role in development'' (pp.131-158). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who are intentional in their actions display regularity in their behavior.&lt;ref name="Mumme"/&gt; Individuals locate objects with their eyes, move towards the object, and then use hands to make contact with and manipulate the object.&lt;ref name= "Mumme"&gt;Mumme, D., Bushnell, E., DiCorcia, J. &amp; Lariviere, L. (2007). Infants' use of gaze cues to interpret others' actions and emotional reactions. In R. Flomm, K. Lee &amp; D. Muir (Eds.), ''Gaze-Following: Its Development and Significance'' (pp. 143–170). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-8058-4750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change in gaze direction is one of several behavioral cues that individuals use in combination with changes in facial and vocal displays and body posture to mark the intention to act on an object.&lt;ref name="Mumme"/&gt; Individuals who seek or follow a joint focus of attention display knowledge that what is in their awareness is also in another's awareness.&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt; They believe that they are experiencing the same world as others.&lt;ref name="Reddy"&gt;Reddy, V. (2005). Before the third element: Understanding attention to self. In N. Eilan, C. Hoerl, T. McCormack &amp; J. Roessler (Eds.), ''Joint attention: Communication and other minds'' (pp. 85–109). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.{{ISBN|0-19-924563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joint attention plays an important role in the development of [[theory of mind]]. Theory of mind and joint attention are important precursors to a fully developed grasp of another individual's mental activity.&lt;ref name="Heal2005"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heal |first1=J. |editor-first=J |editor-last=Roessler |title=Joint attention: Communication and other minds |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |pages=34–44|chapter=Joint attention and understanding the mind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language comprehension ===
[[File:Wpm02 05.JPG|thumb|right|alt= Two teenagers engage in joint attention by reading a book.|Two teenagers engage in joint attention by reading a book.]]

The ability of children to extract information from their environment rests on understandings of [[Attention seeking|attentional behaviors]] such as [[List of gestures#Single hand gestures|pointing]].&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; Episodes of joint attention provide children with a great deal of information about objects by establishing reference and intention.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;Woodward, A. (2005). Infants' understanding of the actions involved in joint attention. In N. Eilan, C. Hoerl, T. McCormack &amp; J. Roessler (Eds.), ''Joint attention: Communication and other minds'' (pp. 110–128). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.{{ISBN|0-19-924563-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joint attention occurs within particular environments. The items and events in that environment provide a context that enables the child to associate meaning with a particular utterance.&lt;ref name="Bruner"&gt;Bruner, J. (1983). ''Child's talk: Learning to use language.'' (pp. 67–88). New York, NY: W.W. Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; Joint attention makes relevant aspects of the context salient, helping children comprehend what is taking place.

===Language production===
An infant's social environment relates to his or her later language development.&lt;ref name=Rollins&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rollins | first1 = P. R. | year = 2003 | title = Caregivers' contingent comments to 9-month-old infants: Relationships with later language | url = | journal = Applied Psycholinguistics | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 221–234 | doi = 10.1017/S0142716403000110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson&gt;Oates J, &amp; Grayson A. (2004). Cognitive and Language Development in Children. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|1-4051-1045-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Infants are more likely to engage in joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention.&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production.&lt;ref name=Rollins/&gt; When joint attention is present, it plays an important role in [[Vocabulary development|word learning]], a crucial aspect of language development.&lt;ref name=Hirotani&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirotani | first1 = M. | last2 = Stets | first2 = M. | last3 = Striano | first3 = T. | last4 = Friederic | first4 = A.D. | year = 2009 | title = Joint attention helps infants learn new words: event-related potential evidence | url = | journal = Developmental Neuroscience | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 600–605 | doi = 10.1097/WNR.0b013e32832a0a7c }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship to [[Social emotional development|socio-emotional development]]===
Joint attention and the ability to attend to an aspect of one's environment are fundamental to normal [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] that rely on the sharing of [[experience]] and [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name= "MacPherson"&gt;MacPherson, A. C. &amp; Moore, C. (2007). Attentional control by gaze cues in infancy. In R. Flomm, K. Lee &amp; D. Muir (Eds.), ''Gaze-Following: Its Development and Significance'' (pp. 53–76). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Infants are highly motivated to share experience. An infant's [[motivation]] to engage in joint attention is strong enough that infants voluntarily turn away from interesting sights to engage in joint attention with others.&lt;ref name="Carpenter"&gt;Carpenter, M. (2011). Social Cognition and Social Motivations in Infancy. In U. Goswami (Eds.), ''The Wiley-Blackwell handbook of childhood cognitive development'' (pp. 106–128). West Sussex, UK: Blackwell Publishing Ltd.{{ISBN|1-4051-9116-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in [[attachment theory]], infants need to develop a relationship with a [[primary caregiver]] to achieve normal social and emotional development. A key part of the ability to develop this relationship may be joint attention. In addition to [[language development]], joint attention serves the function of preparing infants for more complex social structures involved in adult conversation. Children's skills in initiating and responding to joint attention predict their social competence at 30 months of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Hecke | first1 = Amy Vaughan | last2 = Mundy | first2 = Peter C. | last3 = Acra | first3 = C.Franciose | last4 = Block | first4 = Jessica J. | last5 = Delgado | first5 = Christine E.F. | last6 = Parlade | first6 = Meaghan V. | last7 = Myers | first7 = Jessica A. | last8 = Neal | first8 = A.

===Developmental markers in infancy===
At the age of 2 months, children engage in dyadic joint attention and conversation-like exchanges with adults during which each is the focus of the other's attention and they take turns exchanging looks, noises and mouth movements.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; At age 3 months, children display joint attention skills by calling to a caregiver when they are not perceivable.&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt; When caregiver does not respond in a similar manner, child exhibits a series of responses that were first studied in early 1970s by [[Edward Tronick]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ellen-galinsky/trusting-relationships-ar_b_1123524.html Trusting Relationships Are Central to Children's Learning -- Lessons From Edward Tronick], Huffington Post, 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton at the time when the latter was creating the [[Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale]]. At age 6 months, infants display joint attentional skills by:
*Orienting themselves in the same general direction (in their visual field) as another person.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; Infants also cease to focus on the first interesting (salient) object they encounter.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt;
*Following outward directed gaze of adults.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt;
*Extending more sophisticated behaviors, such as gaze checking, when initial gaze following is not successful.&lt;ref name="Heal2005" /&gt;
*Paying more attention to eyes, responding to shifts in eye gaze direction, and directing their own attention based on another's gaze.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt;

At age 8 months, infants demonstrate joint attention through proto-declarative pointing, particularly in girls.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"&gt;Goswami, Usha (2008)''Cognitive Development: The Learning Brain''. New York, NY:Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; At 9 months of age, infants begin to display triadic joint attention.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Infants also will display joint attention activities, such as communicative gestures, social referencing, and using the behavior of others to guide response to novel things.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt;

At one year of age, joint attention is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; At age 15 months, children [[theory of mind|recognize the minds of others]].&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; At this age, children also recognize the importance of eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention.&lt;ref name= "Goswami"/&gt; 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] experience of seeing and the role of eyes&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision.&lt;ref name="Woodward"/&gt; At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well.&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt; Two-year-olds are also capable of [[Mental representation|representational thought]] or [[Information processing|increased memory]].&lt;ref name="Reddy"/&gt;

=== Individuals with disabilities ===
Several studies have shown that problems with joint attention are associated with developmental processes.&lt;ref name= Bhat&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhat | first1 = AN | last2 = Galloway | first2 = JC | last3 = Landa | first3 = RJ | year = | title = Social and non-social visual attention patterns and associative learning in infants at risk for autism | url = | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 51 | issue = 9| pages = 989–997 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02262.x | pmc = 3653974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties in establishing joint attention may partially account for differences in social abilities of children with developmental disorders (i.e. [[Autism spectrum|Autism spectrum disorders]]).&lt;ref name= Bhat/&gt; A core deficit noted in [[autism]] is eye gaze.&lt;ref name="Bruinsma"/&gt; Autistic children have difficulty alternating their attention towards a partner and third object.&lt;ref name="Bruinsma"/&gt; This difficulty is attributed to their deficiencies in following gaze, resulting in difficulty initiating and maintaining joint attention.&lt;ref name="Bruinsma"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bruinsma | first1 = Y. | last2 = Koegel | first2 = R. | last3 = Koegel | first3 = L. | year = 2004 | title = Joint attention and children with autism: A review of the literature | url = | journal = Mental Retardation and Development Disabilities | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 169–175 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20036 | pmid=15611988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deaf infants are able to engage in joint attention similar to hearing infants; however, the time spent engaged in joint attention is often reduced in deaf infants born to hearing parents.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Hearing parents of deaf infants often are less likely to respond and expand on their deaf infants' initiative and communicative acts.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Deaf infants of deaf parents do not show reduced time spent in joint attention.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Auditory input is not critical to joint attention but similar modes of communication and understanding are vital.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; Furthermore, mothers who are unable to successfully establish regular joint attention with their child rate that infant lower on scales of [[social competence]].&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nowakowski | first1 = Matlida E. | last2 = Tasker | first2 = Susan L. | last3 = Schmidt | first3 = Louis A. | year = 2009 | title = Establishment of joint attention in dyads involving hearing mothers of deaf and hearing children and its relation to adaptive social behavior | url = | journal = American Annals of the Deaf | volume = 154 | issue = 1| pages = 15–29 | doi=10.1353/aad.0.0071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judgement of low social competence can be made as early as 18 months of age.&lt;ref name="Nowakowski"/&gt; In blind infants, joint attention is established by means of auditory input or feeling another person's hand on an object and may be delayed compared to sighted infants.&lt;ref name=Bigelow&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bigelow | first1 = A. E. | year = 2003 | title = The development of joint attention in blind infants | url = | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 259–275 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579403000142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other animals ==

=== Definitions in non-human animals ===
Triadic joint attention is the highest level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object.&lt;ref name=Oates&amp;Grayson/&gt; Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that there is an element of shared attention.&lt;ref name="Reddy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobson"/&gt; Triadic attention is marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Dyadic joint attention involves mutual gaze between the parent and infant.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's face.&lt;ref name="3OkamotoBarth2006"&gt;Social Cognition Development in First 2 Years. In T. Matsuzawa M. Tomonaga &amp; M. Tanaka (Eds.), ''Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees'' (pp.182-197). Tokyo: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; If two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

=== Dyadic joint attention ===
Infant and parent chimpanzees show dyadic joint attention in an affectionate manner by looking at each other's eyes&lt;ref name="2OkamotoBarth2006"&gt;Evolutionary Origins of Mother-Infant Relationship. In T. Matsuzawa M. Tomonaga &amp; M. Tanaka (Eds.), ''Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees'' (pp.127-141). Tokyo: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-human animals such as Japanese monkeys, baboons, and other Old World monkeys seldom engage in dyadic joint attention.&lt;ref name="2OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; For these animals, the eye contact involved in dyadic joint attention is deemed threatening.&lt;ref name="2OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

=== Shared gaze ===
Gaze following, or shared gaze, can be found in a number of [[primate]]s.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006"/&gt;{{rp|155–71}} Domesticated animals such as dogs and horses also demonstrate shared gaze.&lt;ref name="Ikatura"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Itakura |first1=S. |title=Gaze Following and Joint Visual Attention in Nonhuman Animals |journal=Japanese Psychological Research |year=2004 |pages=216–226 |volume=46 |issue=3 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-5584.2004.00253.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of joint attention is important for animals because gaze shifts serve as indicators alerting the animal to the location of predators, mates, or food.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

Chimpanzees are capable of actively locating objects that are the focus of another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others.&lt;ref name="Tomasello_et_al.&amp;_Emery_et_al."&gt;Tomasello et al. &amp; Emery et al. as cited in (2006). Development of Joint Attention in Infant Chimpanzees. In T. Matsuzawa M. Tomonaga &amp; M. Tanaka (Eds.), ''Cognitive Development in Chimpanzees'' (pp.155–171). Tokyo: Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view.&lt;ref name="Tomasello_et_al.&amp;_Emery_et_al."/&gt; They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt; Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.&lt;ref name="OkamotoBarth2006" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9248">The '''Lanczos tensor''' or '''Lanczos potential''' is a [[tensor rank|rank 3 tensor]] in [[general relativity]] that generates the [[Weyl tensor]].&lt;ref name="Takeno"&gt;Hyôitirô Takeno, "On the spintensor of Lanczos", ''Tensor'', '''15''' (1964) pp. 103–119.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was first introduced by [[Cornelius Lanczos]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="Lanczos1949"&gt;Cornelius Lanczos, "Lagrangian Multiplier and Riemannian Spaces", ''Rev. Mod. Phys.'', '''21''' (1949) pp. 497–502. {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.21.497}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theoretical importance of the Lanczos tensor is that it serves as the [[gauge field]] for the [[gravitational field]] in the same way that, by analogy, the [[electromagnetic four-potential]] generates the [[electromagnetic field]].&lt;ref name="O'DonnellPye"&gt;P. O’Donnell and H. Pye, "A Brief Historical Review of the Important Developments in Lanczos Potential Theory", ''EJTP'', '''7''' (2010) pp. 327–350. {{url|http://www.ejtp.com/articles/ejtpv7i24p327.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NovelloVelloso"&gt;M. Novello and A. L. Velloso, "The Connection Between General Observers and Lanczos Potential", ''General Relativity and Gravitation'', '''19''' (1987) pp. 1251-1265. {{doi|10.1007/BF00759104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The Lanczos tensor can be defined in a few different ways.  The most common modern definition is through the Weyl–Lanczos equations, which demonstrate the generation of the Weyl tensor from the Lanczos tensor.&lt;ref name="NovelloVelloso" /&gt;  These equations, presented below, were given by Takeno in 1964.&lt;ref name="Takeno" /&gt;  The way that Lanczos introduced the tensor originally was as a [[Lagrange multiplier]]&lt;ref name="Lanczos1949" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Lanczos, "The Splitting of the Riemann Tensor", ''Rev. Mod. Phys.'', '''34''' (1962) pp. 379–389. {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.34.379}}&lt;/ref&gt; on constraint terms studied in the [[variational methods in general relativity|variational approach to general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Lanczos, "A Remarkable Property of the Riemann–Christoffel Tensor in Four Dimensions", ''Annals of Mathematics'', '''39''' (1938) pp. 842–850. {{url|https://www.jstor.org/stable/1968467}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under any definition, the Lanczos tensor ''H'' exhibits the following symmetries:
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{abc}+H_{bac}=0,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{abc}+H_{bca}+H_{cab}=0.
&lt;/math&gt;

The Lanczos tensor always exists in four dimensions&lt;ref name="BC1983"&gt;F. Bampi and G. Caviglia, "Third-order tensor potentials for the Riemann and Weyl tensors", ''General Relativity and Gravitation'', '''15''' (1983) pp. 375–386. {{doi|10.1007/BF00759166}}&lt;/ref&gt; but does not generalize to higher dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;S. B. Edgar, "Nonexistence of the Lanczos potential for the Riemann tensor in higher dimensions", ''General Relativity and Gravitation'', '''26''' (1994) pp. 329–332. {{doi|10.1007/BF02108015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This highlights the [[spacetime#Privileged character of 3+1 spacetime|specialness of four dimensions]].&lt;ref name="O'DonnellPye" /&gt;  Note further that the full [[Riemann tensor]] cannot in general be derived from derivatives of the Lanczos potential alone.&lt;ref name="BC1983" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Massa and E. Pagani, "Is the Riemann tensor derivable from a tensor potential?", ''General Relativity and Gravitation'', '''16''' (1984) pp. 805–816. {{doi|10.1007/BF00762934}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Einstein field equations]] must provide the [[Ricci tensor]] to complete the components of the [[Ricci decomposition]].

===Weyl–Lanczos equations===

The Weyl–Lanczos equations express the Weyl tensor entirely as derivatives of the Lanczos tensor:&lt;ref name="O'Donnell"&gt;P. O’Donnell, "A Solution of the Weyl–Lanczos Equations for the Schwarzschild Space–Time", ''General Relativity and Gravitation'', '''36''' (2004) pp. 1415–1422. {{doi|10.1023/B:GERG.0000022577.11259.e0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
C_{abcd}=
H_{abc;d}+H_{cda;b}+H_{bad;c}+H_{dcb;a} 
+ (H^e{}_{(ac);e} + H_{(a|e|}{}^e{}_{;c)})g_{bd} 
+ (H^e{}_{(bd);e} + H_{(b|e|}{}^e{}_{;d)})g_{ac}
- (H^e{}_{(ad);e} + H_{(a|e|}{}^e{}_{;d)})g_{bc} 
- (H^e{}_{(bc);e} + H_{(b|e|}{}^e{}_{;c)})g_{ad}
-\frac{2}{3} H^{ef}{}_{f;e}(g_{ac}g_{bd}-g_{ad}g_{bc})
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; is the Weyl tensor, the semicolon denotes the [[covariant derivative]], and the subscripted parentheses indicate [[symmetric tensor|symmetrization]].  Although the above equations can be used to define the Lanczos tensor, they also show that it is not unique but rather has [[gauge freedom]] under an [[affine group]].&lt;ref&gt;K. S. Hammon and L. K. Norris "The Affine Geometry of the Lanczos ''H''-tensor Formalism", ''General Relativity and Gravitation'','''25''' (1993) pp. 55–80. {{doi|10.1007/BF00756929}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If &lt;math&gt;\Phi^a&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary [[vector field]], then the Weyl–Lanczos equations are invariant under the gauge transformation

:&lt;math&gt;H'_{abc} = H_{abc}+\Phi_{[a} g_{b]c}&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscripted brackets indicate [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetrization]].  An often convenient choice is the Lanczos algebraic gauge, &lt;math&gt;\Phi_a=-\frac{2}{3}H_{ab}{}^b,&lt;/math&gt; which sets &lt;math&gt;H'_{ab}{}^b=0.&lt;/math&gt;  The gauge can be further restricted through the Lanczos differential gauge &lt;math&gt;H_{ab}{}^c{}_{;c}=0&lt;/math&gt;.  These gauge choices reduce the Weyl–Lanczos equations to the simpler form

:&lt;math&gt;
C_{abcd}=H_{abc;d}+H_{cda;b}+H_{bad;c}+H_{dcb;a}
+H^e{}_{ac;e}g_{bd}+H^e{}_{bd;e}g_{ac}-H^e{}_{ad;e}g_{bc}-H^e{}_{bc;e}g_{ad}.
&lt;/math&gt;

==Wave equation==
The Lanczos potential tensor satisfies a wave equation&lt;ref&gt;P. Dolan and C. W. Kim  "The wave equation for the Lanczos potential", ''Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A'', '''447''' (1994) pp. 557-575. {{doi|10.1098/rspa.1994.0155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\Box H_{abc} = &amp; J_{abc}\\
&amp; {}- 2{R_c}^d H_{abd}+{R_a}^d H_{bcd}+{R_b}^d H_{acd}\\
&amp; {}+ \left( H_{dbe}g_{ac}-H_{dae}g_{bc} \right)R^{de}+\frac{1}{2}RH_{abc},\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Box&lt;/math&gt; is the [[d'Alembert operator]] and
:&lt;math&gt;J_{abc} = R_{ca;b}-R_{cb;a}-\frac{1}{6}\left( g_{ca}R_{;b}-g_{cb}R_{;a} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
is known as the [[Cotton tensor]].  Since the Cotton tensor depends only on [[covariant derivative]]s of the [[Ricci tensor]], it can perhaps be interpreted as a kind of matter current.&lt;ref name="Roberts1996"&gt;Mark D. Roberts, "The Physical Interpretation of the Lanczos Tensor." ''Nuovo Cim.B'' '''110''' (1996) 1165-1176. {{doi|10.1007/BF02724607}} {{arXiv|gr-qc/9904006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The additional self-coupling terms have no direct electromagnetic equivalent.  These self-coupling terms, however, do not affect the [[vacuum solution (general relativity)|vacuum solutions]], where the Ricci tensor vanishes and the curvature is described entirely by the Weyl tensor.  Thus in vacuum, the [[Einstein field equations]] are equivalent to the [[homogeneous differential equation|homogeneous]] wave equation &lt;math&gt;\Box H_{abc} = 0,&lt;/math&gt; in perfect analogy to the vacuum wave equation &lt;math&gt;\Box A_{a} = 0&lt;/math&gt; of the electromagnetic four-potential.  This shows a formal similarity between [[gravitational wave]]s and [[electromagnetic wave]]s, with the Lanczos tensor well-suited for studying gravitational waves.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. López-Bonilla, G. Ovando and J. J. Peña, "A Lanczos Potential for Plane Gravitational Waves." ''Foundations of Physics Letters'' '''12''' (1999) 401-405. {{doi|10.1023/A:1021656622094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the weak field approximation where &lt;math&gt;g_{ab}=\eta_{ab}+h_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, a convenient form for the Lanczos tensor in the Lanczos gauge is&lt;ref name="Roberts1996" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;4H_{abc} \approx h_{ac,b}-h_{bc,a}-\frac{1}{6}(\eta_{ac}{h^d}_{d,b}-\eta_{bc}{h^d}_{d,a}) .&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
The most basic nontrivial case for expressing the Lanczos tensor is, of course, for the [[Schwarzschild metric]].&lt;ref name="NovelloVelloso" /&gt;  The simplest, explicit component representation in [[natural units]] for the Lanczos tensor in this case is
:&lt;math&gt;H_{trt}=\frac{GM}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
with all other components vanishing up to symmetries.  This form, however, is not in the Lanczos gauge.  The nonvanishing terms of the Lanczos tensor in the Lanczos gauge are
:&lt;math&gt;H_{trt}=\frac{2GM}{3r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{r\theta\theta}=\frac{-GM}{3(1-2GM/r)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;H_{r\phi\phi}=\frac{-GM\sin^2 \theta}{3(1-2GM/r)}&lt;/math&gt;

It is further possible to show, even in this simple case, that the Lanczos tensor cannot in general be reduced to a linear combination of the spin coefficients of the [[Newman–Penrose formalism]], which attests to the Lanczos tensor's fundamental nature.&lt;ref name="O'Donnell" /&gt;  Similar calculations have been used to construct arbitrary [[Petrov type D]] solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Zafar Ahsan and Mohd Bilal, "A Solution of Weyl-Lanczos Equations for Arbitrary Petrov Type D Vacuum Spacetimes." ''Int J Theor Phys'' '''49''' (2010) 2713-2722. {{doi|10.1007/s10773-010-0464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lateral violence''' is [[displacement (psychology)|displaced]] violence directed against one's peers rather than adversaries.  This construct is one way of explaining minority-on-minority violence in [[developed nations]].{{uncited|date=October 2018}}  Those experiencing and those committing lateral violence more likely to be involved in crime [[Race and crime in the United States|in the United States]], [[Race and crime in the United Kingdom|the United Kingdom]], and elsewhere.{{uncited|date=October 2018}}  In Australia and Canada, lateral violence is widely seen as an intergenerational learned pattern and major social problem in indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="nwac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwac.ca/sites/default/files/reports/AboriginalLateralViolence%20-%20web%20version.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811190226/http://www.nwac.ca/sites/default/files/reports/AboriginalLateralViolence%20-%20web%20version.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Australia surveys have reported that up to 95% of Aboriginal youth had witnessed lateral violence in the home, and that 95% of the bullying experienced by Aboriginals was perpetrated by other Aboriginals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/people/bullying-lateral-violence|title=Bullying &amp; lateral violence|first=Jens Korff, Creative|last=Spirits|website=Creative Spirits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mandala''' (emphasis on first syllable; [[Sanskrit]] मण्डल, maṇḍala – literally "circle") is a spiritual and ritual [[symbol]] in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], representing the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;{{cite web | title = mandala | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mandala | year = 2008 | publisher = Merriam–Webster Online Dictionary | accessdate = 2008-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In common use, "mandala" has become a generic term for any diagram, chart or geometric pattern that represents the [[cosmos]] metaphysically or symbolically; a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] of the [[universe]].

The basic form of most mandalas is a square with four gates containing a circle with a [[Bindu (symbol)|center point]]. Each gate is in the general shape of a T.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kheper.net/topics/Buddhism/mandala.html Kheper,''The Buddhist Mandala – Sacred Geometry and Art'']&lt;/ref&gt; Mandalas often have radial [[Formal balance|balance]].&lt;ref name=SaylorIntroPDF&gt;{{cite web|last=www.sbctc.edu (adapted)|title=Module 4: The Artistic Principles|url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Module-4.pdf|publisher=Saylor.org|accessdate=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appears in the [[Rigveda]] as the name of the sections of the work, and [[Vedic rituals]] use mandalas such as the [[Navagraha]] mandala to this day. Mandalas are also used in Buddhism.

In various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of practitioners and adepts, as a spiritual guidance tool, for establishing a [[temenos|sacred space]] and as an aid to [[meditation]] and [[trance]] induction.

==Hinduism==
[[File:Vishnu Mandala.jpg|thumb|Mandala of [[Vishnu]]]]

===Religious meaning===
A ''[[yantra]]'' is similar to a mandala, usually smaller and using a more limited colour palette. It may be a two- or three-dimensional geometric composition used in ''[[sadhana]]s'', puja or meditative rituals, and may incorporate a [[mantra]] into its design. It is considered to represent the abode of the deity. Each ''yantra'' is unique and calls the deity into the presence of the practitioner through the elaborate symbolic geometric designs. According to one scholar, "Yantras function as revelatory symbols of cosmic truths and as instructional charts of the spiritual aspect of human experience"&lt;ref&gt;[[Madhu Khanna|Khanna Madhu]], ''Yantra: The Tantric Symbol of Cosmic Unity''. Thames and Hudson, 1979, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many situate ''yantras'' as central focus points for Hindu tantric practice. ''Yantras'' are not representations, but are lived, experiential, [[Nondualism|nondual]] realities. As Khanna describes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Despite its cosmic meanings a ''yantra'' is a reality lived. Because of the relationship that exists in the [[Tantra]]s between the outer world (the macrocosm) and man's inner world (the microcosm), every symbol in a ''yantra'' is ambivalently resonant in inner–outer synthesis, and is associated with the subtle body and aspects of human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Khanna, Madhu, ''Yantra: The Tantric Symbol of Cosmic Unity''. Thames and Hudson, 1979, pp. 12-22&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Political meaning===
{{main|Mandala (political model)}}
The ''[[Rajamandala]]'' (or ''Raja-mandala''; circle of states) was formulated by the [[India]]n author [[Kautilya]] in his work on politics, the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' (written between 4th century BCE and 2nd century BCE). It describes circles of friendly and enemy states surrounding the king's state.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Prof. Mahendra Prasad (2011). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=80q_hd7ASdEC Indian Political Thought: Themes and Thinkers]''. Pearson Education India. {{ISBN|8131758516}}. pp. 11-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In historical, social and political sense, the term "mandala" is also employed to denote traditional Southeast Asian political formations (such as federation of kingdoms or vassalized states). It was adopted by 20th century Western historians from ancient Indian political discourse as a means of avoiding the term 'state' in the conventional sense. Not only did Southeast Asian polities not conform to Chinese and European views of a territorially defined state with fixed borders and a bureaucratic apparatus, but they diverged considerably in the opposite direction: the polity was defined by its centre rather than its boundaries, and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing administrative integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Vajrayana===
{{Main|Vajrayana}}
In [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, mandalas have been developed also into [[sandpainting]]. They are also a key part of [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]] meditation practices.

====Visualisation of Vajrayana teachings====
The mandala can be shown to represent in visual form the core essence of the [[Vajrayana]] teachings. The mind is "a microcosm representing various divine powers at work in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SghdYBbMds0C&amp;pg=PA343 |title=Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs: The New Age Movement |author=John Ankerberg, John Weldon |page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mandala represents the nature of the Pure Land, Enlightened mind.

An example of this type of mandala is [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/37614 ''Vajrabhairava mandala''] a silk tapestry woven with gilded paper depicting lavish elements like crowns and jewelry, which gives a three-dimensional effect to the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vajrabhairava Mandala|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/37614|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watt|first1=James C.Y.|title=When Silk was Gold: Central Asian and Chinese Textiles|date=1997|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|page=95|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/When_Silk_Was_Gold_Central_Asian_and_Chinese_Textiles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mount Meru=====
A mandala can also represent the entire universe, which is traditionally depicted with [[Mount Meru]] as the [[axis mundi]] in the center, surrounded by the continents.&lt;ref&gt;Mipham (2000) pp. 65,80&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/39738 ''Cosmological Mandala with Mount Meru''], a [[silk]] [[tapestry]] from the [[Yuan dynasty]] that serves as a diagram of the Tibetan cosmology, which was given to China from Nepal and Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmological Mandala with Mount Meru|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/39738|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watt|first1=James C.Y.|title=The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty|date=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New York|page=247|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/The_World_of_Khubilai_Khan_Chinese_Art_in_the_Yuan_Dynasty#|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Wisdom and impermanence=====
In the mandala, the outer circle of fire usually symbolises wisdom. The ring of eight [[charnel ground]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdcu.org.au/scw/thanka.html |title=A Monograph on a Vajrayogini Thanka Painting |date=13 August 2003 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030813002533/http://www.bdcu.org.au/scw/thanka.html |archivedate=13 August 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; represents the [[Buddhist]] exhortation to be always mindful of death, and the impermanence with which ''[[samsara]]'' is suffused: "such locations were utilized in order to confront and to realize the transient nature of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/charnel_g.html|title=Charnel- and Cremation Grounds|first=Rufus C.|last=Camphausen|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described elsewhere: "within a flaming rainbow nimbus and encircled by a black ring of [[dorje]]s, the major outer ring depicts the eight great charnel grounds, to emphasize the dangerous nature of human life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sootze.com/tibet/mandala.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303134523/http://www.sootze.com/tibet/mandala.htm |archivedate=2006-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside these rings lie the walls of the mandala palace itself, specifically a place populated by deities and [[Buddha (general)|Buddhas]].

=====Five Buddhas=====
One well-known type of mandala is the mandala of the "Five Buddhas", archetypal Buddha forms embodying various aspects of enlightenment. Such Buddhas are depicted depending on the school of [[Buddhism]], and even the specific purpose of the mandala. A common mandala of this type is that of the [[Five Wisdom Buddhas]] (a.k.a. Five ''[[Jinas]]''), the Buddhas [[Vairocana]], [[Aksobhya]], [[Ratnasambhava]], [[Amitabha]] and [[Amoghasiddhi]]. When paired with another mandala depicting the [[Five Wisdom Kings]], this forms the [[Mandala of the Two Realms]].

====Practice====
[[File:Painted 19th century Tibetan mandala of the Naropa tradition, Vajrayogini stands in the center of two crossed red triangles, Rubin Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Tantric mandala of [[Vajrayogini]]]]
Mandalas are commonly used by tantric Buddhists as an aid to meditation.

The mandala is "a support for the meditating person",&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; something to be repeatedly contemplated to the point of saturation, such that the image of the mandala becomes fully internalised in even the minutest detail and can then be summoned and contemplated at will as a clear and vivid visualized image. With every mandala comes what Tucci calls "its associated liturgy ... contained in texts known as [[tantras]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianart.com/mandalas/tibet.html|title=The Mandala in Tibet|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; instructing practitioners on how the mandala should be drawn, built and visualised, and indicating the [[mantra]]s to be recited during its ritual use.

By visualizing "pure lands", one learns to understand experience ''itself'' as pure, and as the abode of enlightenment. The protection that we need, in this view, is from our own minds, as much as from external sources of confusion. In many tantric mandalas, this aspect of separation and protection from the outer samsaric world is depicted by "the four outer circles: the purifying fire of wisdom, the [[vajra]] circle, the circle with the eight tombs, the lotus circle".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jyh.dk/indengl.htm|title=Mandala|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ring of ''vajras'' forms a connected fence-like arrangement running around the perimeter of the outer mandala circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jyh.dk/indengl.htm#Circles|title=Mandala|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a meditation on impermanence (a central teaching of [[Buddhism]]), after days or weeks of creating the intricate pattern of a [[sand mandala]], the sand is brushed together into a pile and spilled into a body of running water to spread the blessings of the mandala.

[[Per Kvaerne|Kværne]]&lt;ref&gt;Per Kvaerne 1975: p.&amp;nbsp;164&lt;/ref&gt; in his extended discussion of [[sahaja]], discusses the relationship of [[sadhana]] interiority and exteriority in relation to mandala thus:
{{quote|...external ritual and internal sadhana form an indistinguishable whole, and this unity finds its most pregnant expression in the form of the mandala, the sacred enclosure consisting of concentric squares and circles drawn on the ground and representing that adamant plane of being on which the aspirant to Buddha hood wishes to establish himself. The unfolding of the tantric ritual depends on the mandala; and where a material mandala is not employed, the adept proceeds to construct one mentally in the course of his meditation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kvaerne|first= Per |year=1975|title= On the Concept of Sahaja in Indian Buddhist Tantric Literature. (NB: article first published in ''Temenos'' XI (1975): pp.88-135). Cited in: Williams, Jane (2005).'' Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies, Volume 6.'' Routledge.

====Offerings====
[[File:Chenrezig Sand Mandala.jpg|thumb|[[Chenrezig]] [[sand mandala]] created at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] on the occasion of the [[Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama's]] visit in May 2008]]

A "mandala offering"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybuddhism.com/en/tibetan-buddhism/tantra/buddhist-tantra/what-is-a-mandala|title=What Is a Mandala?|website=studybuddhism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is a symbolic offering of the entire universe. Every intricate detail of these mandalas is fixed in the tradition and has specific symbolic meanings, often on more than one level.

Whereas the above mandala represents the pure surroundings of a Buddha, this mandala represents the universe. This type of mandala is used for the mandala-offerings, during which one symbolically offers the universe to the Buddhas or to one's teacher. Within Vajrayana practice, 1,000,000 of these mandala offerings (to create merit) can be part of the preliminary practices before a student even begins actual tantric practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thubtenchodron.org/PrayersAndPractices/preliminary_practice.htm|title=Preliminary practice (ngöndro) overview|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mandala is generally structured according to the model of the universe as taught in a Buddhist classic text the ''[[Abhidharmakosha|Abhidharma-kośa]]'', with [[Mount Meru]] at the centre, surrounded by the continents, oceans and mountains, etc.

===Shingon Buddhism===
One Japanese branch of Mahayana Buddhism—[[Shingon]] Buddhism—makes frequent use of mandalas in its rituals as well, though the actual mandalas differ. When Shingon's founder, [[Kukai]], returned from his training in China, he brought back two mandalas that became central to Shingon ritual: the [[Womb Realm|Mandala of the Womb Realm]] and the [[Diamond Realm|Mandala of the Diamond Realm]].

These two mandalas are engaged in the ''[[abhiseka]]'' initiation rituals for new Shingon students, more commonly known as the ''Kechien Kanjō'' (結縁灌頂). A common feature of this ritual is to blindfold the new initiate and to have them throw a flower upon either mandala. Where the flower lands assists in the determination of which [[yidam|tutelary deity]] the initiate should follow.

[[Sand mandala]]s, as found in Tibetan Buddhism, are not practiced in Shingon Buddhism.

=== Nichiren Buddhism ===
The mandala in [[Nichiren Buddhism]] is called a ''moji-mandala'' (文字曼陀羅) and is a paper [[hanging scroll]] or wooden tablet whose inscription consists of [[kanji|Chinese characters]] and [[Siddhaṃ script|medieval-Sanskrit script]] representing elements of the Buddha's [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], protective Buddhist deities, and certain Buddhist concepts. Called the ''[[Gohonzon]]'', it was originally inscribed by [[Nichiren]], the founder of this branch of [[Japanese Buddhism]], during the late 13th Century. The ''Gohonzon'' is the primary object of veneration in some Nichiren schools and the only one in others, which consider it to be the supreme object of worship as the embodiment of the supreme [[Dharma]] and Nichiren's inner enlightenment. The seven characters [[Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō]], considered to be the name of the supreme Dharma, as well as the [[invocation]] that believers chant, are written down the center of all Nichiren-sect ''Gohonzons'', whose appearance may otherwise vary depending on the particular school and other factors.

===Pure Land Buddhism===
Mandalas have sometimes been used in [[Pure Land Buddhism]] to graphically represent [[Pure Land]]s, based on descriptions found in the ''[[Larger Sutra]]'' and the ''[[Contemplation Sutra]]''. The most famous mandala in Japan is the [[Taima mandala]], dated to about 763 CE. The Taima mandala is based on the ''Contemplation Sutra'', but other similar mandalas have been made subsequently. Unlike mandalas used in [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, it is not used as an object of meditation or for esoteric ritual. Instead, it provides a visual representation of the Pure Land texts, and is used as a teaching aid.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Also in [[Jodo Shinshu]] Buddhism, [[Shinran]] and his descendant, [[Rennyo]], sought a way to create easily accessible objects of reverence for the lower-classes of Japanese society. Shinran designed a mandala using a hanging scroll, and the words of the ''[[nembutsu]]'' (南無阿彌陀佛) written vertically. This style of mandala is still used by some [[Jodo Shinshu]] Buddhists in home altars, or ''[[butsudan]]''.

==Mesoamerican civilizations==
===Mayan ''Tzolk'in''===
[[File:Mayan_Compass_2.jpg|thumb|right|Mayan ''[[Tzolk'in]]'' wheel from 498 AD.]]
One of several parallels between Eastern and [[Mesoamerican]] cultures, the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] civilization tended to present calendars in a mandala form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frontiers-of-anthropology.blogspot.com/2012/01/mayan-mandala.html Frontiers of Anthropology — The Mayan Mandala]&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar in form and function to the ''[[Kalachakra]]'' (Wheel of Time) sand paintings of Tibetan Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.human-resonance.org/maya.html Mandalas of the Maya: Celestial Waters and the Auroral Plumes of Tláloc]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''tzolk'in'' wheel has 260 segments, surprising because the Mayans recognized that the calendar year is 365 days long. The inclusion of the specific number 260 could however relate to the 26,000 year cycle of the precession of the equinoxes. If so, this would indicate a remarkable awareness of these great cycles of time by this culture. Ultimately, the symbol was probably used for ritual purposes, and to measure the interval of a number of 9-month intervals like pregnancy, the cultivation time of some crops, and rituals that were performed at a 260-day spacing each year, for example, spring and fall.

This Mayan symbology has even made its way into [[New Age]] symbolism as the [[Dreamspell]] calendar, developed by [[José Argüelles]]. Sometimes described as an authentic Mayan mandala, it is "inspired by" elements of the ''Tzolk'in'' wheel of time.

===Aztec Sun Stone===
[[File:Aztec_calendar_on_Amate.jpg|thumb|right|The Aztec Sun Stone as an [[amate]] print.]]
The [[Aztec calendar stone|Sun Stone]] of the Aztec civilization was once believed to be their equivalent of a Tzolk'in calendar, but is now thought to be a ceremonial representation of the entire universe as seen by the Aztec religious class.

The earliest interpretations of the stone relate to its use as a calendar. In 1792, two years after the stone's unearthing, Mexican anthropologist [[Antonio de León y Gama]] wrote a treatise on the Aztec calendar using the stone as its basis.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio de León y Gama: ''Descripción histórica y cronológica de las dos piedras'' [http://memory.loc.gov/service/rbc/rbc0001/2006/2006kislak2/2006kislak2.pdf León y Gama]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the circles of [[glyph]]s are the glyphs for the days of the month.&lt;ref name="colonial_latin_america_p23"&gt;K. Mills, W. B. Taylor &amp; S. L. Graham (eds), ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History'', 'The Aztec Stone of the Five Eras', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The four symbols included in the Ollin glyph represent the four past suns that the Mexica believed the earth had passed through.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=State and Cosmos in the Art of Tenochtitlan|last=Townsend|first=Casey|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks|year=1979|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the stone is its religious significance. One theory is that the face at the center of the stone represents [[Tonatiuh]], the Aztec deity of the sun. It is for this reason that the stone became known as the "Sun Stone." Richard Townsend proposed a different theory, claiming that the figure at the center of the stone represents [[Tlaltecuhtli]], the Mexica earth deity who features in Mexica creation myths.&lt;ref name="colonial_latin_america_p23" /&gt; Modern archaeologists, such as those at the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología|National Anthropology Museum]] in Mexico City, believe it is more likely to have been used primarily as a ceremonial basin or ritual altar for [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|gladiatorial sacrifices]] than as an astrological or astronomical reference.&lt;ref name="getty.edu"&gt;[https://www.getty.edu/research/exhibitions_events/exhibitions/obsidian_mirror/aztec_calendar_stone.html Getty Museum, "Aztec Calendar Stone"] ''getty.edu'', accessed 22 August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another characteristic of the stone is its possible geographic significance. The four points may relate to the four corners of the earth or the cardinal points. The inner circles may express space as well as time.&lt;ref&gt;K. Mills, W. B. Taylor &amp; S. L. Graham (eds), ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History'', 'The Aztec Stone of the Five Eras', pp. 23, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, there is the political aspect of the stone. It may have been intended to show [[Tenochtitlan]] as the center of the world and therefore, as the center of authority.&lt;ref&gt;K. Mills, W. B. Taylor &amp; S. L. Graham (eds), ''Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History'', 'The Aztec Stone of the Five Eras', pp. 25-6&lt;/ref&gt; Townsend argues for this idea, claiming that the small glyphs of additional dates amongst the four previous suns—1 Flint (''Tecpatl''), 1 Rain (''Atl''), and 7 Monkey (''Ozomahtli'')—represent matters of historical importance to the Mexica state. He posits, for example, that 7 Monkey represents the significant day for the cult of a community within ''Tenochtitlan''. His claim is further supported by the presence of Mexica ruler [[Moctezuma II]]'s name on the work. These elements ground the Stone's iconography in history rather than myth and the legitimacy of the state in the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/912811300|title=State and cosmos in the art of Tenochtitlan|last=Townsend|first=Richard Fraser|date=1997-01-01|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University|year=|isbn=9780884020837|location=|pages=|oclc=912811300|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
[[File:Marsh-chapel-window.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rose window|round window]] at the site of the [[Marsh Chapel Experiment]] supervised by [[Walter Pahnke]]]]
Forms which are evocative of mandalas are prevalent in Christianity: the [[celtic cross]]; the [[rosary]]; the [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]; the [[aureole]]; [[oculus|oculi]]; the [[Crown of Thorns]]; [[rose window]]s; the [[Rosy Cross]]; and the [[dromenon]] on the floor of [[Chartres Cathedral]]. The dromenon represents a journey from the outer world to the inner sacred centre where the Divine is found.&lt;ref&gt;See David Fontana: "Meditating with Mandalas", p. 11, 54, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cosmati]] [[Pavement (architecture)|pavement]]s, including that at [[Westminster Abbey]], are geometric mandala-like [[mosaic]] designs from thirteenth century Italy. The Great Pavement at Westminster Abbey is believed to embody divine and cosmic geometries as the seat of enthronement of the monarchs of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/conservation/video-library|title=Cosmati Pavement - Video Library|website=www.westminster-abbey.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, many of the Illuminations of [[Hildegard von Bingen]] can be used as mandalas, as well as many of the images of [[esoteric Christianity]], as in [[Christian]] [[Hermeticism]], [[Christian]] [[Alchemy]], and [[Rosicrucianism]].

Alchemist, Mathematician and Astrologer [[John Dee]] developed a geometric symbol which he called the ''[[Sigillum Dei]]'' 'Seal of God' manifesting a universal geometric order which incorporated the names of the [[archangels]], derived from earlier forms of the ''clavicula salomonis'' or [[key of Solomon]].
[[File:Sloane3188-john dee.png|thumb|right|The Seal of God; a mystic [[pentagram]] symbol composed by Dee]]
[[The Layer Monument]], an early 17th-century marble mural funerary monument at the [[Church of Saint John the Baptist, Maddermarket, Norwich]], is a rare example of Christian iconography absorbing alchemical symbolism to create a mandala in Western funerary art.

== Mandalas in Persian art ==
In Persian Islamic theosophy, each of us is a part of God. We have been separated from our source like the rays of the sun and, we need to always keep in our mind that we have a divine light in us, which is the source of love. This light always shows us the right path to grow and find our way back to our source.

Therefore in Persian Shamseh motif which symbolizes the sun, there is a center which is the symbol of god or the source of energy. This small circle is surrounded by many other circles or polygons with the same center but in different sizes. These circles are the light rays of the sun which symbolize every god’s creature. Every creature tends to reach God, so the purpose of life is to reach back the source of energy which is mentioned as pure love in some references. Some of us are closer to our origin, while some of us have a long journey to reach it. As in Shamseh, some circles are smaller, therefore, closer to the center.

Shamseh motif was wildly applied during Safavid time in Iran. Safavid was one of the most important ruling dynasties of Iran in art, architecture, astrology, philosophy, and theosophy. An extraordinary example of Shamseh motif would be the tiling of the ceiling of Sheik Lotfollah mosque in Isfahan. Persian "Shamseh" motif painted on a copper plate. The art of hand painting and enameling is called "Meenakari" in Farsi.]]

==Western psychological interpretations==
According to art therapist and mental health counselor Susanne F. Fincher, we owe the re-introduction of mandalas into modern Western thought to [[Carl Jung]], the Swiss analytical psychologist. In his pioneering exploration of the unconscious through his own art making, Jung observed the motif of the circle spontaneously appearing. The circle drawings reflected his inner state at that moment. Familiarity with the philosophical writings of India prompted Jung to adopt the word "mandala" to describe these circle drawings he and his patients made. In his autobiography, Jung wrote:
{{quote|I sketched every morning in a notebook a small circular drawing, ... which seemed to correspond to my inner situation at the time. ... Only gradually did I discover what the mandala really is: ... the Self, the wholeness of the personality, which if all goes well is harmonious.|Carl Jung|''[[Memories, Dreams, Reflections]]'', pp. 195–196.}}

Jung recognized that the urge to make mandalas emerges during moments of intense personal growth. Their appearance indicates a profound re-balancing process is underway in the psyche. The result of the process is a more complex and better integrated personality.
{{quote|The mandala serves a conservative purpose—namely, to restore a previously existing order. But it also serves the creative purpose of giving expression and form to something that does not yet exist, something new and unique. ... The process is that of the ascending spiral, which grows upward while simultaneously returning again and again to the same point.|Jungian analyst [[Marie-Louise von Franz]]|C. G. Jung: ''[[Man and His Symbols]]'', p. 225}}

Creating mandalas helps stabilize, integrate, and re-order inner life.&lt;ref&gt;see Susanne F. Fincher: ''Creating Mandalas: For Insight, Healing, and Self-Expression'', pp. 1 - 18&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the psychologist [[David Fontana]], its symbolic nature can help one "to access progressively deeper levels of the unconscious, ultimately assisting the meditator to experience a mystical sense of oneness with the ultimate unity from which the cosmos in all its manifold forms arises."&lt;ref&gt;See David Fontana: ''Meditating with Mandalas'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==In archaeology==
One of the most intense archaeological discoveries in recent years that could redefine the history of eastern thought and tradition of mandala is the discovery of five giant mandalas in the valley of [[Manipur]] made with Google Earth imagery. Located in the paddy field in the west of [[Imphal]], the capital of Manipur, the Maklang geoglyph is perhaps the world’s largest mandala built entirely of mud. The site wasn’t discovered until 2013 as its whole structure could only be visible via Google Earth satellite imagery. The whole paddy field, locally known as [[Bihu Loukon]], is now protected and announced as historical monument and site by the government of Manipur in the same year.  The site is situated 12&amp;nbsp;km aerial distance from [[Kangla]] with the GPS coordinates of 24° 48' N and 93° 49' E. It covers a total area of around 224,161.45 square meters. This square mandala has four similar protruding rectangular ‘gates’  in the cardinal directions guarded each by similar but smaller rectangular ‘gates’ on the left and right. Within the square there is an eight petalled flower or rayed-star, recently called as Maklang ‘Star fort’ by the locals, in the centre covering a total area of around 50,836.66 square meters. The discovery of other five giant mandalas in the valley of Manipur is also made with Google Earth.  The five giant mandalas, viz., Sekmai mandala, Heikakmapal mandala, Phurju twin mandalas and Sangolmang mandala are located on the western bank of the Iril River.&lt;ref&gt;Wangam, Somorjit (2018). ''World's Largest Mandalas from Manipur and Carl Jung's Archetype of the Self'', p. 25-33. NeScholar, ed. Dr. R.K.Nimai Singh ,Imphal. {{ISSN|2350-0336}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In architecture==
[[File:Borobudur Mandala.svg|thumb|right|Borobudur ground plan taking the form of a Mandala]]
[[Buddhist architecture]] often applied mandala as the blueprint or plan to design Buddhist structures, including [[Buddhist temple|temple complex]] and stupas. A notable example of mandala in architecture is the 9th century [[Borobudur]] in Central Java, Indonesia. It is built as a large [[stupa]] surrounded by smaller ones arranged on terraces formed as a [[stepped pyramid]], and when viewed from above, takes the form of a giant [[Vajrayana|tantric Buddhist]] mandala, simultaneously representing the Buddhist cosmology and the nature of mind.&lt;ref name="Wayman"&gt;{{cite conference|author=A. Wayman| title=Reflections on the Theory of Barabudur as a Mandala| booktitle=Barabudur History and Significance of a Buddhist Monument| publisher=Asian Humanities Press| location=Berkeley| year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other temples from the same period also has mandala plan, including [[Sewu]], [[Plaosan]] and [[Prambanan]]. The similar mandala plan design are also observable in Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar.

==In science==
[[File:Hexapoda phylogenetic tree.png|thumb|Phylogenetic tree of [[Hexapoda]] (insects and their six-legged relatives). Such trees have been called ''phylogenetic mandalas''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasegawa|first=Masami|title=Phylogeny mandalas for illustrating the Tree of Life|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume=117|pages=168–178|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2016.11.001|pmid=27816710|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Circular diagrams are often used in [[phylogenetics]], especially for the graphical representation of phylogenetic relationships. [[Phylogenetic tree|Evolutionary trees]] often encompass numerous species that are conveniently shown on a circular tree, with images of the species shown on the periphery of a tree. Such diagrams have been called phylogenetic mandalas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==In contemporary use==
Mandalas can be found in early [[Buddhist]] art from the [[14th century|14th]] and [[15th century|15th centuries]].

Fashion designer [[Mandali Mendrilla]] designed an interactive art installation called Mandala of Desires (Blue Lotus Wish Tree) made in peace silk and eco friendly textile ink, displayed at the [[China Art Museum]] in Shanghai in November 2015. The pattern of the dress was based on the Goloka Yantra mandala, shaped as a lotus with eight petals. Visitors were invited to place a wish on the sculpture dress, which will be taken to India and offered to a genuine living [[Wish Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://formsofdevotion.org/china-art-museum-in-shanghai/|title=China Art Museum in Shanghai - Forms of Devotion|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wall.hr/fashion/izlozena-haljina-mandali-mendrile-hit-je-izlozbe-u-najvecem-kineskom-muzeju/|title=Haljinu "Mandala of Desires" dnevno posjećuje čak 30 000 ljudi!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uniqueness and notations == 
[[File:Uniqueness-of-nodal-decomposition-2.jpg|thumb|Uniqueness of the nodal decomposition.]] If exists, the nodal decomposition is unique up to an isomorphism in the following sense: for any two  nodal decompositions &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\sigma\circ\beta\circ\pi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\sigma'\circ\beta'\circ\pi'&lt;/math&gt; there exist [[Morphism#Isomorphisms|isomorphism]]s &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; such that 
: &lt;math&gt;\pi'=\eta\circ\pi,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\beta=\theta\circ\beta'\circ\eta,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sigma'=\sigma\circ\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Nodal-decomposition-notations.jpg|thumb|Notations.]] 
This property justifies some special notations for the elements of the nodal decomposition: 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \pi=\operatorname{coim}_\infty \varphi, &amp;&amp; 
P=\operatorname{Coim}_\infty \varphi,\\
&amp; \beta=\operatorname{red}_\infty \varphi, &amp;&amp;  \\
&amp; \sigma=\operatorname{im}_\infty \varphi, &amp;&amp;  
Q=\operatorname{Im}_\infty \varphi,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt; 
– here &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{coim}_\infty \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Coim}_\infty \varphi&lt;/math&gt; are called the ''nodal coimage of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'', &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{im}_\infty \varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}_\infty \varphi&lt;/math&gt; the ''nodal image of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;'', and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{red}_\infty \varphi&lt;/math&gt; the ''nodal reduced part of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;''.

In these notations the nodal decomposition takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi=\operatorname{im}_\infty \varphi\circ\operatorname{red}_\infty \varphi \circ \operatorname{coim}_\infty \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

== Connection with the basic decomposition in pre-abelian categories == 
In a [[pre-abelian category]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt; each morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; has a standard decomposition 
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi=\operatorname{im} \varphi\circ\operatorname{red} \varphi\circ\operatorname{coim} \varphi&lt;/math&gt;,
called the ''basic decomposition'' (here &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{im} \varphi=\ker(\operatorname{coker} \varphi)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{coim} \varphi=\operatorname{coker}(\ker\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{red} \varphi&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the image, the coimage and the reduced part of the morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;).

[[File:Nodal-and-basic-decomposition-1.jpg|thumb|Nodal and basic decompositions.]] If a morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; in a [[pre-abelian category]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt; has a nodal decomposition, then there exist morphisms &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; which (being not necessarily isomorphisms) connect the nodal decomposition with the basic decomposition by the following identities:
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{coim}_\infty \varphi=\eta\circ\operatorname{coim} \varphi,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{red} \varphi=\theta\circ\operatorname{red}_\infty \varphi\circ\eta,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{im}_\infty \varphi=\operatorname{im} \varphi\circ\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

== Categories with nodal decomposition == 
A category &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''category with nodal decomposition''{{sfn|Akbarov|2016|p=28}} if each morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; has a nodal decomposition in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt;. This property plays an important role in constructing [[envelope (category theory)|envelope]]s and [[refinement (category theory)|refinement]]s in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt;. 

In an [[abelian category]] &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal K}&lt;/math&gt; the basic decomposition

The theory of '''ologs''' is an attempt to provide a rigorous mathematical framework for knowledge representation, construction of scientific models and data storage using [[category theory]], linguistic and graphical tools. Ologs were introduced in 2010 by David Spivak,&lt;ref name=Spivak&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1102.1889v1|author1=Spivak|title=Ologs: A categorical framework for knowledge representation|class=cs.LO|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a research scientist in the Department of Mathematics, [[MIT]].

==Etymology==
The term "olog" is short for "[[ontology (information science)|ontology]] log". "Ontology" derives from ''[[wiktionary:onto-|onto-]]'', from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[wiktionary:ὤν|ὤν]], ὄντος'' "being; that which is", present participle of the verb ''[[wiktionary:εἰμί|εἰμί]]'' "be", and [[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]], [[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]: ''science'', ''study'', ''theory''.

==Mathematical formalism==
At the basic level an olog &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] whose [[Mathematical object|objects]] are represented as boxes containing sentences and whose [[morphisms]] are represented as directed labeled arrows between boxes. The structures of the sentences for both the objects and the morphisms of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; need to be compatible with the mathematical definition of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;. This compatibility cannot be checked mathematically, because it lies in the correspondence between mathematical ideas and natural language.

Every olog has a ''target category'', which is taken to be &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Category of sets]]), the category of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and [[functions (mathematics)|functions]], unless otherwise mentioned. In that case, we are looking at a ''set'' of amino acids, a ''set'' of amine groups, and a ''function'' that assigns to every amino acid its amine group. In this article we usually stick to &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt;, though sometimes using the [[Kleisli category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{P}}&lt;/math&gt; of the power set monad. Another possibility, though one we do not use here, would be to use the Kleisli category of probability distributions—the Giry monad&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=Giry+monad|title=Giry monad}}&lt;/ref&gt;—e.g., to obtain a generalization of [[Markov decision process#Category theoretic interpretation|Markov decision processes]].

The boxes in the above example refer to objects of &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the box containing the sentence "an amino acid" refers to the set of all amino acids and the box containing the sentence "a side chain" refers to the set of all side chains. The arrow labeled with "has" whose source is "an amino acid" and whose target is "a side chain" refers to a morphism between two objects of &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; and thus needs to be a function between two sets. Indeed, every amino acid has a unique side chain so the arrow is a valid morphism of &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt;. The functional nature of the morphisms in &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; is expressed in an olog by labeling arrows with appropriate sentences (e.g. "has").

For another example let &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{P},\eta,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[power set]] [[monad (category theory)|monad]] on &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; so given &lt;math&gt;A\in Ob(\textbf{Set})&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the power set of A, the [[natural transformation]] &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; sends &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt; to the [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] &lt;math&gt;\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; and the natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; unionizes sets. A morphism &lt;math&gt;f:A\to B&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Kleisli category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{P}}&lt;/math&gt; can be seen as establishing a [[binary relation]] R. Given &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\in B&lt;/math&gt; we say that &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\in R&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;b\in f(a)&lt;/math&gt;.

We can use &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{P}}&lt;/math&gt; as the target category for an olog. In this case the arrows in the olog need to reflect the relational nature of morphisms in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{P}}&lt;/math&gt;. This can be done by labeling every arrow in the olog with either "is related to", or "is greater than" and so on.

==Ologs and databases==
An olog &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; can also be viewed as a [[database schema]]. Every box (object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;) in the olog is a [[table (database)|table]] &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and the arrows (morphisms) emanating from the box are columns in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;. The assignment of a particular instance to an object of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is done through a [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;I:\mathcal{C}\to \textbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt;. In the example above, the box "an amino acid" will be represented as a table whose number of rows is equal to the number of types of amino acids and whose number of columns is three, one column for each arrow emanating from that box.

==Relations between ologs==
Communication between different ologs which in practice can be communication between different models or world-views is done using [[functors]]. Spivak coins the notions of a 'meaningful' and 'strongly meaningful' functors.&lt;ref name="Spivak" /&gt; Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; be two ologs, &lt;math&gt;I:\mathcal{C}\to \textbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J:\mathcal{D}\to \textbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt; functors (see the section on ologs and databases) and &lt;math&gt;F:\mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; a functor. We say that a &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is ''meaningful'' if there exists a natural transformation &lt;math&gt;m:I\to F^{*}J&lt;/math&gt; (the [[pullback (category theory)|pullback]] of J by F).

Taking as an example &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; as two different scientific models, the functor &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is meaningful if predictions, which are objects in &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt;, made by the first model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; can be translated to the second model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

We say that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is ''strongly meaningful'' if given an object &lt;math&gt;X\in \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;I(X)=J(F(X))&lt;/math&gt;. This equality is equivalent to requiring &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; to be a natural isomorphism.

Sometime it will be hard to find a meaningful functor &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;. In such a case we may try to define a new olog &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; which represents the common ground of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; and find meaningful functors &lt;math&gt;F_{\mathcal{C}}:\mathcal{B}\to \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{\mathcal{D}}:\mathcal{B}\to \mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

If communication between ologs is limited to a two-way communication as described above then we may think of a collection of ologs as nodes of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] and of the edges as functors connecting the ologs. If a simultaneous communication between more than two ologs is allowed then the graph becomes a symmetric simplicial complex.

==Rules of good practice==
Spivak provides some rules of good practice for writing an olog whose morphisms have a functional nature (see the first example in the section Mathematical formalism).&lt;ref name="Spivak" /&gt; The text in a box should adhere to the following rules:

# begin with the word "a" or "an". (Example: "an amino acid").
# refer to a distinction made and recognizable by the olog's author.
# refer to a distinction for which there is well defined functor whose range is &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Set}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. an instance can be documented. (Example: there is a set of all amino acids).
# declare all variables in a compound structure. (Example: instead of writing in a box "a man and a woman" write "a man &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and a woman &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; " or "a pair &lt;math&gt;(m,w)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a man and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is a woman").

The first three rules ensure that the objects (the boxes) defined by the olog's author are well-defined sets. The fourth rule improves the labeling of arrows in an olog.

==Applications==
The concept was experimentally documented by David Spivak and coauthors Associate Professor Markus J. Buehler of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and CEE graduate student Tristan Giesa in a paper that was published in the December 2011 issue of ''BioNanoScience'' in which the researchers establish a scientific analogy between spider silk and musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1111.5297|last1=Giesa |first1=Tristan |last2= Spivak |first2=David I. |last3=Buehler |first3=Markus J. |title=Reoccurring patterns in hierarchical protein materials and music: The power of analogies|year=2011 |doi=10.1007/s12668-011-0022-5 |volume=1 |issue=4 |journal=BioNanoScience |pages=153–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pawn Stars Australia''''' is the Australian adaption of the [[Pawn Stars|American series of the same name]]. It premiered on 21 July 2015 on [[A&amp;E Australia|A&amp;E]].&lt;ref name="series details"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hansen|first1=Nick|title=Bondi's Happy Hockers in Pawn Stars Australian spin-off|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/city-east/bondis-happy-hockers-in-pawn-stars-australian-spin-off/story-fngr8h22-1227444676066|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=Wentworth Courier|date=17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian version is the third international spin-off after [[Pawn Stars UK]] and Pawn Stars South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hogan|first1=Matthew|title=Sydney trio into hardcore pawn|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305135237/https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/28827861/sydney-trio-into-hardcore-pawn/|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=[[The West Australian]]|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series stars brothers Aaron and Ben Senes along with their childhood mate Shanon Folden, who own the well-known chain of pawn stores called ''Happy Hockers'' in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blundell|first1=Graeme|title=Reality TV show Pawn Stars Australia is a big deal|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/reality-tv-show-pawn-stars-australia-is-a-big-deal/story-fn9n8gph-1227435498997|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=[[The Australian]]|date=11 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The series is directed by Martin Baker and produced by Leftfield Pictures, the same company that produces the American original.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

The complete first season DVD was scheduled to be released on 5 October 2016.

==Development and production==
In April 2014 it was reported that a local adaption of ''Pawn Stars'' was in the works, with filming starting at Sydney's ''Happy Hockers'' which would last 9 weeks. It was believed an official announcement of a late 2014 premiere on A&amp;E would come in the following days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Auerbach|first=Taylor|title=The Pawn Stars of Bondi Beach: Hit American hock show hits Australia starring brothers 'Baz and Shaz'|newspaper=Daily Mail Australia|date=4 April 2014|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2596556/Aussie-Pawn-Stars-coming-Hit-American-hock-filming-Australian-spinoff-Bondi-Beach-pawn-shop.html|accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it wasn't until August 2014 that the series had officially been commissioned, and that Leftfield Pictures (the company behind ''Pawn Stars U.S.'') were officially confirmed as the producers of the local adaption. It was also stated that the series would air in 2015, rather than in 2014 as previously rumoured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|first=David|last=Knox|title=Pawn Stars Australia coming to A&amp;E|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2014/08/pawn-stars-australia-coming-to-ae.html|accessdate=22 July 2015|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015 it was announced the series would officially star brothers Aaron and Ben Senes and best friend Shanon Folden and would premiere on 21 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|first=David|last=Knox|title=Airdate: Pawn Stars Australia|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2015/06/airdate-pawn-stars-australia.html|accessdate=22 July 2015|date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senes brother said they agreed to do the reality series to help the public know about the pawn industry, which they said is misunderstood. "People can see it's a legitimate operation where we do everything by the book and we have a successful business to prove it", Ben Senes said.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt; The brothers have been in the business for 22 years. Selling jewellery and electronics is the "bread-and-butter" of their business but people also bring in highly unusual items. Through the years they have seen everything from monkey testicles, to gold teeth fillings to rare collectibles such as a vintage red telephone box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Molloy|first1=Shannon|title=From monkey testicles to gold tooth fillings, these are the weird things people try to pawn|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/entertainment/television/from-monkey-testicles-to-gold-tooth-fillings-these-are-the-weird-things-people-try-to-pawn/story-fnhoh21a-1227441647844|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=Perth Now|date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Happy Hockers'' operates 5 stores across Sydney, the series is filmed almost entirely at their [[Bondi Beach]] store.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;

''This article will use the [[Einstein summation convention]].''

The theory of [[general relativity]] required the adaptation of existing theories of physical, electromagnetic, and quantum effects to account for non-Euclidean geometries. These '''physical theories modified by general relativity''' are described below.

==Classical mechanics and special relativity==
Classical mechanics and special relativity are lumped together here because special relativity is in many ways intermediate between general relativity and classical mechanics, and shares many attributes with classical mechanics.

In the following discussion, the [[mathematics of general relativity]] is used heavily. Also, under the [[principle of minimal coupling]], the physical equations of special relativity can be turned into their general relativity counterparts by replacing the Minkowski metric (''η&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'') with the relevant metric of spacetime (''g&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;'') and by replacing any partial derivatives with covariant derivatives. In the discussions that follow, the change of metrics is implied.

===Inertia===
Inertial motion is motion free of all [[force]]s. In Newtonian mechanics, the force ''F'' acting on a particle with mass ''m'' is given by [[Newton's second law]], &lt;math&gt;F=m \ddot{r}&lt;/math&gt;, where the acceleration is given by the second derivative of position ''r'' with respect to time ''t'' . Zero force means that inertial motion is just motion with zero acceleration:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 r}{\mathrm{d}t^2}=0&lt;/math&gt;

The idea is the same in special relativity. Using [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]], inertial motion is described mathematically as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x^a}{\mathrm{d}\tau^2} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the position coordinate and ''τ'' is [[proper time]]. (In Newtonian mechanics, ''τ ≡ t'', the coordinate time).

In both Newtonian mechanics and special relativity, space and then spacetime are assumed to be flat, and we can construct a global Cartesian coordinate system. In general relativity, these restrictions on the shape of spacetime and on the coordinate system to be used are lost. Therefore, a different definition of inertial motion is required. In relativity, inertial motion occurs along timelike or null [[geodesic]]s as parameterized by proper time. This is expressed mathematically by the [[geodesic equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 x^a}{\mathrm{d}\tau^2} + \Gamma^a_{bc} \, \frac{\mathrm{d} x^b}{\mathrm{d}\tau} \,\frac{\mathrm{d} x^c}{\mathrm{d}\tau} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^a_{bc}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Christoffel symbol]]. Since general relativity describes four-dimensional spacetime, this represents four equations, with each one describing the second derivative of a coordinate with respect to proper time. In the case of flat space in Cartesian coordinates, we have &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^a_{bc}=0&lt;/math&gt;, so this equation reduces to the special relativity form.

===Gravitation===
For gravitation, the relationship between Newton's theory of [[gravity]] and general relativity is governed by the [[correspondence principle]]: General relativity must produce the same results as gravity does for the cases where Newtonian physics has been shown to be accurate.

Around a spherically symmetric object, the Newtonian theory of gravity predicts that objects will be physically accelerated towards the center on the object by the rule

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\ddot r} = GM \mathbf{\hat{r}}/r^2&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is Newton's [[Gravitational constant]], ''M'' is the mass of the gravitating object, ''r'' is the distance to the gravitation object, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector identifying the direction to the massive object.

In the [[weak-field approximation]] of general relativity, an identical coordinate acceleration must exist. For the Schwarzschild solution (which is the simplest possible spacetime surrounding a massive object), the same acceleration as that which (in Newtonian physics) is created by gravity is obtained when a constant of integration is set equal to ''2MG/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''). For more information, see [[Deriving the Schwarzschild solution]].

===Transition from Newtonian mechanics to general relativity===
{{main|Newtonian foundation of general relativity}}

Some of the basic concepts of general relativity can be outlined outside the [[Special relativity|relativistic]] domain. In particular, the idea that mass/energy generates [[curvature]] in [[Spacetime|space]] and that curvature affects the motion of masses can be illustrated in a [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian]] setting.

General relativity generalizes the [[geodesic equation]] and the [[Einstein field equation|field equation]] to the relativistic realm in which trajectories in space are replaced with [[Fermi–Walker transport]] along [[world line]]s in [[spacetime]]. The equations are also generalized to more complicated curvatures.

===Transition from special relativity to general relativity===
{{main|Theoretical motivation for general relativity}}

The basic structure of general relativity, including the [[geodesic equation]] and [[Einstein field equation]], can be obtained from [[special relativity]] by examining the [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of a particle in a [[circular orbit]] about the earth. In terms of [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]], the transition involves replacing [[global Lorentz covariance]] with [[local Lorentz covariance]].

===Conservation of energy–momentum===
In classical mechanics, conservation laws for energy and momentum are handled separately in the two principles of [[conservation of energy]] and [[Momentum#Conservation|conservation of momentum]]. With the advent of [[special relativity]], these two conservation principles were united through the concept of [[mass-energy equivalence]].

Mathematically, the general relativity statement of energy–momentum conservation is:

:&lt;math&gt;{T_a}^b{}_{; b} = {T_a}^b{}_{,b} + {\Gamma^b}_{cb} \, {T_a}^c - {\Gamma^c}_{ab} \, {T_c}^b = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{T_a}^b&lt;/math&gt; is the [[stress–energy tensor]], the comma indicates a partial derivative and the semicolon indicates a [[covariant derivative]]. The terms involving the Christoffel symbols are absent in the special relativity statement of energy–momentum conservation.

Unlike classical mechanics and special relativity, it is not usually possible to unambiguously define the total energy and momentum in general relativity, so the tensorial conservation laws are ''local'' statements only (see [[ADM energy]], though). This often causes confusion in time-dependent spacetimes which apparently do not conserve energy, although the local law is always satisfied. Exact formulation of energy–momentum conservation on an arbitrary geometry requires use of a non-unique [[stress-energy–momentum pseudotensor]].

==Electromagnetism==
{{main|Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime}}

General relativity modifies the description of [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic phenomena]] by employing a new version of [[Maxwell's equations]]. These differ from the [[Formulation of Maxwell's equations in special relativity|special relativity form]] in that the Christoffel symbols make their presence in the equations via the covariant derivative.

The source equations of [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]] in curved spacetime are (in [[cgs units]])

:&lt;math&gt; F^{\,ab}{}_{;b} = {4\pi \over c }\,J^{\,a}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F&lt;sup&gt;ab&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the [[electromagnetic field tensor]] representing the electromagnetic field and ''J&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a [[four-current]] representing the sources of the electromagnetic field.

The source-free equations are the same as their special relativity counterparts.

The effect of an [[electromagnetic field]] on a charged object is then modified to
:&lt;math&gt; P^{\, a} {}_{\, ;\tau} = (q/m)\,F^{\,ab}P_b&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''q'' is the charge on the object, ''m'' is the rest mass of the object and ''P&lt;sup&gt; a&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the [[four-momentum]] of the charged object. Maxwell's equations in flat spacetime are recovered in rectangular coordinates by reverting the covariant derivatives to partial derivatives. For Maxwell's equations in flat spacetime in curvilinear coordinates see [http://www.uic.edu/classes/eecs/eecs520/textbook/node2.html]
or [http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/MaxwellEquations.html]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1403">'''Proximity Analysis''' is an analytical technique used to determine the relationship between a selected point and its neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Blinn, Charles R., Lloyd P. Queen, and Les W. Maki, ''[http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/naturalresources/components/DD6097hr.html "Geographic Information Systems: A Glossary."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322230358/http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/naturalresources/components/DD6097hr.html |date=2010-03-22 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; Proximity analysis is a crucial tool for business marketing and [[site selection]]. Marketers analyze demographics and infrastructure to determine trade areas. Trade areas are continuous geographic areas around a site that generate the majority of revenue.

Proximity Analysis is a study using [[location intelligence]], mapping software, to calculate the distances between customer/prospect locations, to your location(s) (retail store, bank, restaurant, dealer, or sales reps) as the first step in building an understanding of trade/sales/service area(s).   An analysis typically includes a report and map showing the relationship of the data and often includes competitor locations in the analysis.

{{Bertrand Russell}}

'''Russell's teapot''' is an [[analogy]], formulated by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970), to illustrate that the [[philosophic burden of proof]] lies upon a person making [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] claims, rather than shifting the burden of ''disproof'' to others.  

Russell specifically applied his analogy in the context of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe. ''The Philosophical Case Against Literal Truth: Russell's Teapot // Christmas - Philosophy for Everyone: Better Than a Lump of Coal''. — John Wiley and Sons, 2010. — Т. 5. — P. 65-66. — 256 p. — (Philosophy for Everyone). — {{ISBN|9781444330908}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that if he were to assert, without offering proof, that a [[teapot]], too small to be seen by telescopes, orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, he could not expect anyone to believe him solely because his assertion could not be proven wrong. 

Russell's teapot is still invoked in discussions concerning the [[existence of God]], and has had influence in various fields and media.

== Description ==
In an article titled "Is There a God?" commissioned, but never published, by ''Illustrated'' magazine in 1952, Russell wrote:

{{quote|Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Is There a God? [1952]|editor-first=John G.|editor-last=Slater|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|title=The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, Vol. 11: Last Philosophical Testament, 1943–68|year=1952|url=http://russell.mcmaster.ca/cpbr11p69.pdf|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=542–548|isbn=9780415094092}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In 1958, Russell elaborated on the analogy:

{{quote|I ought to call myself an agnostic; but, for all practical purposes, I am an atheist. I do not think the existence of the Christian God any more probable than the existence of the [[Ancient Greek religion|Gods of Olympus]] or [[Norse religion|Valhalla]]. To take another illustration: nobody can prove that there is not between the Earth and Mars a china teapot revolving in an elliptical orbit, but nobody thinks this sufficiently likely to be taken into account in practice. I think the Christian God just as unlikely.&lt;ref name="garvey"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Brian |last=Garvey |title=Absence of Evidence, Evidence of Absence, and the Atheist's Teapot |journal=[[Ars Disputandi]] |year=2010 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=9–22 |doi=10.1080/15665399.2010.10820011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
Chemist [[Peter Atkins]] said that the point of Russell's teapot is that there is no burden on anyone to disprove assertions. [[Occam's razor]] suggests that the simpler theory with fewer assertions (e.g., a universe with no supernatural beings) should be the starting point in the discussion rather than the more complex theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science|editor=Clayton, Philip|editor2=Simpson, Zachary R.|first=Peter|last=Atkins|authorlink=Peter Atkins|contribution=Atheism and science|pages=129–130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WhGyYy0SIoC|accessdate=2016-03-03|isbn=9780199279272|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, philosopher [[Paul Chamberlain]] says it is logically erroneous to assert that positive truth claims bear a burden of proof while negative truth claims do not.&lt;ref name="chamberlain"&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Chamberlain|title=Why People Don't Believe: Confronting Six Challenges to Christian Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AdNgqzawLAC&amp;pg=PA82 |year=2011|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-1-4412-3209-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that all truth claims bear a burden of proof, and that like [[Mother Goose]] and the [[tooth fairy]], the teapot bears the greater burden not because of its negativity, but because of its triviality, arguing that "When we substitute normal, serious characters such as Plato, Nero, Winston Churchill, or George Washington in place of these fictional characters, it becomes clear that anyone denying the existence of these figures has a burden of proof equal to, or in some cases greater than, the person claiming they do exist."&lt;ref name="chamberlain"/&gt;

In his books ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) and ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), geneticist [[Richard Dawkins]] used the teapot as an analogy of an argument against what he termed "agnostic conciliation", a policy of intellectual appeasement that allows for philosophical domains that concern exclusively religious matters.&lt;ref name="devchap"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-618-33540-4 | title-link = A Devil's Chaplain | chapter = The Great Convergence | pages = 146-151 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nBRYZtOuqZcC&amp;pg=PA146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Science has no way of establishing the existence or non-existence of a god. Therefore, according to the agnostic conciliator, because it is a matter of individual taste, belief and disbelief in a supreme being are deserving of equal respect and attention. Dawkins presents the teapot as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of this position: if agnosticism demands giving equal respect to the belief and disbelief in a supreme being, then it must also give equal respect to belief in an orbiting teapot, since the existence of an orbiting teapot is just as plausible scientifically as the existence of a supreme being.&lt;ref name = "goddel"&gt;{{cite book | title = The God Delusion | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | publisher = [[Random House]] | year = 2016 | edition = 10th Anniversary | isbn = 9781784161934 | title-link = The God Delusion | chapter = The Poverty of Agnosticism | pages = 69-77 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=emE7DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Brian Garvey argues that the teapot analogy fails with regard to religion because, with the teapot, the believer and non-believer are simply disagreeing about one item in the universe and may hold in common all other beliefs about the universe, which is not true of an atheist and a theist.&lt;ref name="garvey"/&gt; Garvey argues that it is not a matter of the theist propounding existence of a thing and the atheist simply denying it – each is asserting an alternative explanation of why the cosmos exists and is the way it is: "the atheist is not just denying an existence that the theist affirms – the atheist is in addition committed to the view that the universe is not the way it is because of God. It is either the way it is because of something other than God, or there is no reason it is the way it is."&lt;ref name="garvey"/&gt;

Philosopher [[Peter van Inwagen]] argues that while Russell's teapot is a fine piece of rhetoric, its logical argument form is less than clear, and attempting to make it clear reveals that the Teapot Argument is very far from cogent.&lt;ref name = "Epistemology"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Right to Believe: Perspectives in Religious Epistemology | editor1-first = Dariusz | editor1-last = Łukasiewicz | editor2-first = Roger | editor2-last = Pouivet | first = Peter | last = van Inwagen | authorlink = Peter van Inwagen | chapter = Russell's China Teapot | pages = 11-26 | publisher = [[Ontos Verlag]] | location = Frankfurt | year = 2012 | isbn = 9783110320169 | url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bmyK32rqKf0C&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another philosopher, [[Alvin Plantinga]] states that a falsehood lies at the heart of Russell's argument. Russell's argument assumes that there is no evidence against the teapot, but Plantinga disagrees:

{{quote|Clearly we have a great deal of evidence against teapotism. For example, as far as we know, the only way a teapot could have gotten into orbit around the sun would be if some country with sufficiently developed space-shot capabilities had shot this pot into orbit. No country with such capabilities is sufficiently frivolous to waste its resources by trying to send a teapot into orbit. Furthermore, if some country had done so, it would have been all over the news; we would certainly have heard about it. But we haven't. And so on. There is plenty of evidence against teapotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Gutting|first = Gary|authorlink = Gary Gutting|date = February 9, 2014|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|url = http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/is-atheism-irrational/|title = Is Atheism Irrational?|accessdate = July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[Gary Gutting]] rejects Russell's teapot for similar reasons, arguing that Russell's argument accords theism far less support than it actually has. Gutting points out that numerous sensible, competent people appeal to personal experience and arguments in support of God's existence. Thus, to simply reject the existence of God, out of hand, seems unjustified, according to Gutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/on-dawkinss-atheism-a-response|date = August 11, 2010|accessdate = November 27, 2018|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|title = On Dawkins's Atheism: A Response|first = Gary|last = Gutting|authorlink = Gary Gutting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], without believing in God, says that belief in God "is a good deal more reasonable than belief in a teapot" because God is a "grand and big idea" which "is not analogically disproved by reference to celestial teapots or vacuum cleaners, which lack the necessary bigness and grandeur" and "because God cannot be [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]], cannot be turned into a mere thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James|last=Wood|authorlink=James Wood (critic)|title=The Celestial Teapot|journal=[[The New Republic]]|date=18 December 2006|issue=27|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/the-celestial-teapot|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One counter-argument, advanced by philosopher Eric Reitan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Eric |last=Reitan |title=Contributors |publisher=Religion Dispatches |url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/contributors/ericreitan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that belief in God is different from belief in a teapot because teapots are physical and therefore in principle verifiable, and that given what we know about the physical world we have no good reason to think that belief in Russell's teapot is justified and at least some reason to think it not.&lt;ref name=Reitan&gt;{{cite book | title = Is God a Delusion? |first = Eric |last=Reitan|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | date = 2008 | media_type = | pages = 78–80 | isbn = 978-1-4051-8361-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar analogies ==
Other thinkers have posited non-disprovable analogies, such as [[J. B. Bury]] in his 1913 book, ''History of Freedom of Thought'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people speak as if we were not justified in rejecting a theological doctrine unless we can prove it false. But the burden of proof does not lie upon the rejecter.... If you were told that in a certain planet revolving around Sirius there is a race of donkeys who speak the English language and spend their time in discussing eugenics, you could not disprove the statement, but would it, on that account, have any claim to be believed? Some minds would be prepared to accept it, if it were reiterated often enough, through the potent force of suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= History of Freedom of Thought|edition= Illustrated Edition, published 2014 by [[Lulu Press, Inc.]]|isbn= 9781304988607 |last= Bury|first= John Bagnall|authorlink= J.

[[Astronomer]] [[Carl Sagan]] in his 1995 book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' offered a similar non-disprovable analogy called the Dragon in the Garage as an example of skeptical thinking. If Sagan claimed there was a dragon in his garage, you would wish to verify it for yourself but if Sagan's dragon was impossible to detect:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sagan|first1=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark|date=1995|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=9780394535128|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ybvaAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions:r7NWYii6Wt0C|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influence in religious parodies ==
The concept of Russell's teapot has influenced more explicitly [[Parody religion|religion-parodying]] concepts such as the [[Invisible Pink Unicorn]]&lt;ref name = "goddel"/&gt; and the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]].&lt;ref name="Wolf2006"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Church of the Non-Believers | first=Gary | last=Wolf | date=14 November 2006 | publisher=[[Wired News]] | url=https://www.wired.com/2006/11/atheism/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1960s musician and psychedelic poet [[Daevid Allen]] of the band [[Gong (band)|Gong]] employed the image of a flying teapot in his [[Gong (band)#Mythology|Planet Gong Universe]] and the ''[[Flying Teapot (album)|Flying Teapot]]'' album trilogy, and refers to Russell's teapot in his book ''Gong Dreaming 2: The Histories &amp; Mysteries of Gong from 1969-1975''.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6435">'''Second modernity''' is a phrase coined by the [[Germany|German]] [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Ulrich Beck]], and is his word for the period after [[modernity]].

Where modernity broke down [[Agrarian society|agricultural society]] in favour of [[industrial society]], second modernity transforms industrial society into a new and more reflexive [[network society]] or information society {{harv|He|2012|loc=111 and 215}}.

==Risk society==
{{Main|Risk society}}
Second modernity is marked by a new awareness of the risks — risks to all forms of life, plant, animal and human — created by the very successes of modernity in tackling the problem of human scarcity {{harv|Carrier and Nordmann|2011|loc=449}}. Systems that previously seemed to offer protection from risks both natural and social are increasingly recognised as producing new man-made risks on a global scale as a byproduct of their functioning {{harv|He|2012|loc=147}}. Such systems become part of the problem, not the solution. Modernisation and information advances themselves create new social dangers, such as [[cybercrime]] (He 2012, 69), while scientific advances open up new areas, like [[cloning]] or [[genetic modification]], where decisions are necessarily made without adequate capacity to assess longterm consequences {{harv|Allan, Adam, and Carter|1999|loc=xii–ii}}.

Recognising the fresh dilemmas created by this [[reflexive modernization]], Beck has suggested a new "cosmopolitan Realpolitik" to overcome the difficulties of a world in which national interests can no longer be promoted effectively at the national level alone {{harv|Beck|2006|loc=173}}.

==Knowledge society==
Second modernity has also been linked to the so-called [[Society#Knowledge|knowledge society]], marked by a pluralisation of different types of knowledge {{harv|Carrier|n.d.|loc=439 and 448}}. It is characterised in particular by knowledge-dependent risks — the uncertainties manufactured by the information world itself {{harv|Harding|2008|loc=55–58}}.

==Resistance==

Various forms of resistance to second modernity have emerged, among them for example [[Euroscepticism]] {{harv|Marchetti and Vidović|2010|loc=171}}.

Beck himself sees [[al-Qaeda]] as a by-product of, as well as resistance to, second modernity, not only in its use of information technology tools, but also in its syncretist ideology {{harv|Beck|2006|loc=113}}.

PLoS ONE 6, e26893 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In basically all major primate taxa, aggression is used by the dominant males when herding females and keeping them away from other males.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt; In [[hamadryas baboon]]s, the males often bite the females’ necks and threaten them.&lt;ref name="eleven"&gt;Nitsch, F., Stueckle, S., Stahl, D. &amp; Zinner, D. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-011-0258-2 Copulation patterns in captive hamadryas baboons: a quantitative analysis]. Primates; journal of primatology 52, 373–83 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Wild chimpanzees can charge at females, shake branches, hit, slap, kick, pound, drag, and bite them. Orangutans are among the most forceful of mammals. [[Bornean orangutan]]s (''Pongo pygmaeus'') exhibited aggression in almost 90 percent of their copulations, including when the females were not resisting.&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;Knott, C. D., Emery Thompson, M., Stumpf, R. M. &amp; McIntyre, M. H. [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/277/1678/105.full Female reproductive strategies in orangutans, evidence for female choice and counterstrategies to infanticide in a species with frequent sexual coercion]. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 277, 105–13 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; A possible explanation for aggressive behaviors in primates is that it is a way for males to train females to be afraid of them and be more likely to surrender to future sexual advances.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Intimidation===

Males may also use more indirect techniques to mate with females, such as [[intimidation]]. While most female water striders ([[Gerridae]]) have their genitalia exposed, females of the water strider species ''[[Gerris gracilicornis]]'' have evolved a shield over their genitals. As a result, males cannot physically coerce females because mating is difficult unless the female exposes her genitalia. Therefore, males intimidate females into mating by attracting predators; they tap on the water’s surface and create ripples that catch the attention of predatory fish. From there, it is in the best interest of the female to mate, and as quickly as possible, to avoid being eaten by predators. Typical mating positions of water striders have the females on the bottom, closer to predators, so the risk of predation is much higher for them. Females succumb to copulation to get males to cease signaling to predators.&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;Han, C. S. &amp; Jablonski, P. G. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2964456/ Male water striders attract predators to intimidate females into copulation]. Nature Communications 1, 52 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another indirect form of sexual coercion occurs in red-sided garter snakes, ''[[Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis]]''. When males "court" females, they line their bodies up to the females' and produce caudocephalic waves, which are a series of muscle contractions that travel through their bodies from tail to head. The exact reason for this behavior is unknown, but some studies show that it relates to stress. Females have nonrespiratory air sacs containing anoxic air, and the waving pushes this air into her lungs. The resulting stress causes her cloaca to open, and aids the male in inserting his [[hemipenis]]. The stronger and more frequent the caudocephalic waves and the closer the male’s cloaca to the female’s, the more likely the male is to mate successfully.&lt;ref name="fourteen"&gt;Shine, R., Langkilde, T. &amp; Mason, R. T. [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Shine/publication/222434765_Courtship_tactics_in_garter_snakes_How_do_a_male's_morphology_and_behaviour_influence_his_mating_success/links/0fcfd4fc46ad6dfdfc000000.pdf Courtship tactics in garter snakes: how do a male’s morphology and behaviour influence his mating success?] Animal Behaviour 67, 477–483 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grasping and grappling{{anchor|Grasping.2FGrappling}}===
{{see also|Sexual conflict#Grasping}}
Males of certain species have evolved mating behaviors in which they forcefully attempt to mate with and inseminate females, often employing grasping techniques. These male grasping devices exist to increase the duration of copulation and restrict females from mating with other males. They are in some ways a form of [[mate guarding]]. While some males have evolved different types of modifications to aid in grasping, others just grab females and attempt to force copulation.

One type of grasping modification is [[Sexual conflict#Spiky genitals|spiny male genitalia]]. In [[seed beetle]]s (Coleoptera: Bruchidae), males possess sclerotized spines on their genitalia. These spines are used during copulation to help overcome female resistance and penetrate into their copulatory duct. In addition to aiding penetration, these spines promote the passage of seminal fluids, and act as an anchor to keep the female from fleeing. Furthermore, spiny genitals can injure the females and make them less likely to remate.&lt;ref name=six /&gt; [[Sepsidae]] fly males have modifications on their forelegs to help them grasp onto female wing bases. These modifications include cuticular outgrowths, indentations, and bristles, and males use them to secure themselves onto females after jumping on them. Once the males grab on, a struggle ensues akin to a [[rodeo]], where males try to hold on while females violently shake them off.&lt;ref name=five /&gt;

Another type of modification is found in male diving beetles (of the family Dytiscidae), who are equipped with suction cup structures on their front legs. They use these to grab passing females and attach to their dorsal surfaces. To get the females to submit, males shake the females violently and keep them submerged underwater (diving beetles cannot go long without atmospheric oxygen). Unable to get air, female diving beetles submit to the male’s advances in order to avoid drowning (and they lose the energy to resist). Once the males attach, copulation can occur.&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;Bergsten, J. &amp; Miller, K. B. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000522 Phylogeny of diving beetles reveals a coevolutionary arms race between the sexes]. PLoS ONE 2, e522 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Male waterfowl have developed another modification; while most male birds have no external genitalia, male waterfowl (Aves: [[Anatidae]]) have a phallus (length {{convert|1.5|-|4.0|cm|in|disp=x| [|]}}). Most birds mate with the males balancing on top of the females and touching cloacas in a “cloacal kiss”; this makes forceful insemination very difficult. The phallus that male waterfowl have evolved everts out of their bodies (in a clockwise coil) and aids in inseminating females without their cooperation.&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;Brennan, P. L. R. et al. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0000418 Coevolution of male and female genital morphology in waterfowl]. PLoS ONE 2, e418 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another such technique is having a "lock-like" mechanism, found in ''[[Drosophila montana]]'', dogs, wolves, and pigs. Towards the end of copulation, females struggle to try to dislodge the males, whose genital organs take much longer to deflate than females do; the locking (most commonly known in [[canid]]s as a "tie") allows the males to copulate for as long as they need to until they are finished. In dogs, the male has [[bulbus glandis|a knot in his penis]] that gets engorged with blood and ties the female, locking them together during copulation, until the act is complete. Male dogs have evolved this mechanism during mating in order to prevent other males from penetration whilst they are and the use of the tie enables them to be more likely to inseminate the female and produce a healthy litter of pups. Breaking this "tie" can be physically harmful to both females and males.&lt;ref name="seventeen"&gt;Mazzi, D., Kesäniemi, J., Hoikkala, A. &amp; Klappert, K. [https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-9-132 Sexual conflict over the duration of copulation in Drosophila montana: why is longer better?] BMC Evolutionary Biology 9, 132 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Males of many species simply grab the females and force a mating. Coercive mating is very common in water striders ([[Gerridae]]) because in most of the species, the female genitalia are often exposed and easily accessible to males.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Without any courtship behavior, males initiate by forcefully trying to mount the females. Carrying the males on their backs is energetically costly to females, so they try to resist and throw off the males. The males fight back even harder and use their forelegs to tightly grasp the female’s thorax and keep them from escaping.&lt;ref name="eighteen"&gt;Han, C. S., Jablonski, P. G., Kim, B. &amp; Park, F. C. [https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-10-359 Size-assortative mating and sexual size dimorphism are predictable from simple mechanics of mate-grasping behavior]. BMC Evolutionary Biology 10, 359 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The males then forcefully insert their genitalia into the female vulvar opening.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; In the newt species ''[[Notophthalmus viridescens]]'', males carry out a courtship behavior called [[amplexus]]. It consists of males capturing females that do not want to mate with them and using their hind limbs to grasp the females by their pectoral regions.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

Male guppies (''[[Poecilia reticulata]]'') have been observed to forcefully copulate with females by trying to insert their [[gonopodium]] (male sex organ) into female’s genital pores, whether or not they are accepting.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Sometimes, male guppies also try to forcefully mate with ''[[Skiffia bilineata]]'' (goodeid) females, which resemble guppy females and tend to share the same habitat, even when guppy females are available. A possible explanation for this is the deeper genital cavity of ''S. bilineata'', which stimulates the males more than when mating with guppy females.&lt;ref name=nine /&gt;

Males of some species are able to immobilize females and force copulation. In pigs and boars, males grab females and maneuver the pelvis to lift the vaginal opening and facilitate copulation. The stimulation following intromission causes the female to be immobilized. The male can then freely continue copulation without worrying about the female escaping.&lt;ref name="nineteen"&gt;Zehr, J. L. NIH Public Access. 41, 101–112 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Immobilization of the female also occurs in [[muscovy duck]]s.

Grasping and/or grappling mating situations have also been documented in ''[[Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis]] haemorrhoidalis'' ([[Odonata]]),&lt;ref name="twenty"&gt;Rivera, a C. &amp; Andrés, J. a [https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/2/1/14/863639 Male coercion and convenience polyandry in a calopterygid damselfly].

===Infanticide===
{{Main|Infanticide (zoology)}}
In some mammal species, mostly nonhuman primates,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} it is common for males to commit infanticide to mate with females. This happens often in species that live in groups, such as Old and New World monkeys, apes, prosimians, and hamadryas baboons.&lt;ref name="twenty three"/&gt; There is usually a single breeding male in a group, and when an outside male aggressively takes over, he kills off all of the young offspring. The males kill infants that are not their own to assert their strength and position, and mate with the females.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;  Sometimes, multiple males will invade a troop and gang up on females, killing their offspring and subsequently mating with them. This occurs in [[spider monkey]]s, red-backed [[squirrel monkey]]s, chimpanzees, and [[red howler (disambiguation)|red howler]]s.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Secretions===

In the newt species ''[[Notophthalmus viridescens]]'', the males rub off hormonal secretions onto the skin of the females they are courting. These hormones have been shown to make the female more receptive to mating with the male. When the male deposits the secretions, he detaches from the female and releases a spermatophore (containing spermatozoa). It is then the female’s decision to either accept it and pick it up or reject it by running away; these hormones make her more likely to accept it.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

===Coercive faithfulness===

====Post-copulatory guarding====

Another form of coercion is male mate guarding, used to keep females from mating with other males, and often involves aggression.&lt;ref name=seven /&gt; Guarding allows the males to assure their paternity. A classic example occurs in diving beetles, family Dytiscidae. After copulation, males continue to guard females for up to six hours. They hold them underwater, occasionally tilting them up for air.&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt;  Guarding also occurs in water striders where, once males complete their sperm transfer, they often remain on top of the females. This guarding duration varies, lasting from several minutes to several weeks. The purpose of such long guarding periods is for the males to see the females lay their eggs and be assured that the offspring are theirs.&lt;ref name=eighteen /&gt;  This behavior also occurs in hamadryas baboons (''Papio hamadryas''), where the leader males practice intensive mate guarding.&lt;ref name="twenty three" /&gt;  In ''Drosophila'' Montana, studies have shown that following mate guarding, the chances of a female mating with or being inseminated by another male were greatly diminished. This shows that the mate guarding tactic can be very effective.&lt;ref name=seventeen /&gt;

====Secretions/ejaculations====

Males of some species use bodily fluids, such as seminal fluid from their ejaculate, to aid in the coercion of females. Seminal fluid in males of Drosophila melanogaster may contain chemicals that increase the amount of time it takes for females to remate, decrease the length of successive matings, or keep her from remating at all. The less a female mates with other males after copulation with a male, the more likely it is for him to ensure his paternity. These chemicals may also serve to increase the female’s reproductive success, but at the cost of decreased longevity and immune response.&lt;ref name=seventeen /&gt;

In many species, seminal fluid can be used as a sort of mating plug. Males of these species transfer their sperm at the beginning of copulation and use the rest of copulation to transfer substances that help build up the mating plugs. These plugs are effective in ensuring that the female does not mate with any other males and that the male’s paternity is secured.&lt;ref name=seventeen /&gt;

==Costs to females==

===Direct===

A major direct cost of sexual coercion is physical injury.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Male seed beetles (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) have sclerotized spine on their genitalia, which penetrate the female and leave melanized scars. Females can be physically injured from just one mating, and the more a female mates, the more scarring forms in the copulatory duct.&lt;ref name=six /&gt; In guppies, the male’s gonopodium can cause damage when forcefully inserted, causing cloacal damage to the females.&lt;ref name=nine /&gt; In fowl, females can be physically injured during forceful copulations. Also, semen transferred from the males can contain pathogens and fecal matter, which can lead to disease and decrease female fitness.&lt;ref name="twenty one" /&gt; In elephant seals, physical injury happens very often. In fact, mating leads to 1 in every 1,000 female elephant seals getting killed.&lt;ref name=nineteen /&gt; Other species in which the females (and/or their offspring) are injured or even killed include lions, rodents, farm cats, crabeater seals, elephant seals, sea lions,&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt; wild Trinidadian guppies (''Poecilia reticulata''),&lt;ref name=eight /&gt; red-sided garter snakes (''Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis''),&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt; and newts (''N. viridescens'').&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

Another cost is the excess energy and time expenditure that comes with mating. For example, female water striders, Gerridae,&lt;ref name=eighteen /&gt;  and marine snails of the genus ''Littorina'' 24 have to carry the males on their backs while they mate. First of all, this is a great loss of energy.&lt;ref name=eighteen /&gt; Second, both the male and the female are at a much greater risk of predation in this position.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Furthermore, the time spent mating interferes with the time that could have been spent foraging&lt;ref name=four /&gt;  and feeding.&lt;ref name="twenty five"&gt;Darden, S. K., James, R., Ramnarine, I. W. &amp; Croft, D. P. [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/04/20/rspb.2009.0087.full Social implications of the battle of the sexes: sexual harassment disrupts female sociality and social recognition]. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 276, 2651–6 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, sexual coercion can lower body condition and immunity in ways other than physical damage. Harassment can lead to stress, which can result in weight loss, decreased immune function and energy stores, and less feeding, which has been seen in red-spotted newts.&lt;ref name=three /&gt; Furthermore, when females are constantly moving around to avoid violent males, they are not able to form female social ties (for example, [[Grévy's zebra]]/Equus grevyi).&lt;ref name="twenty five" /&gt; This also happens in species where herding males sometimes do not permit females to join their family in different groups, like in hamadryas baboons.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Indirect===

Indirect costs are those that affect females in the future. One such cost happens because sexual coercion does not allow females to choose the males they want to mate with, which are usually males that are higher quality, compatible, and/or have good genes that will increase their offspring’s survival and fitness. Coercion decreases this choice and can lead to their offspring having lower genetic quality. Studies of the rose bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus), have shown that offspring of females with mate choice had higher survival rates than offspring of females that did not.&lt;ref name=four /&gt; Another ultimate cost comes from when males commit infanticide to obtain mating access. This loss of offspring leads to a decrease in fitness of females.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

==Female counter-adaptations==

===Anatomical protection===

As a response to sexual coercion and the costs that females face, one of their counter-adaptations is the evolution of anatomical protection.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Females of some species, such as the water striders, developed morphological shields to protect their genitalia from males that want to forcefully copulate.&lt;ref name=thirteen /&gt; Some Gerridae females have also evolved abdominal spines and altered the shapes of their abdomens to make them less accessible to males.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

Waterfowl males of the family Aves: Anatidae [[Bird penis|have evolved a phallus]] to aid in coercion. This phallus everts out of the male body (when it’s time to mate) in a counter-clockwise coil. As a response, females have developed vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils to protect themselves from forceful intromission.&lt;ref name=sixteen /&gt; Waterfowl females have evolved these “convoluted vaginal morphologies” to make it harder for males to insert themselves without the female’s consent.&lt;ref name="twenty six"&gt;Brennan, P. L. R., Clark, C. J. &amp; Prum, R. O. [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/12/18/rspb.2009.2139.full.html Explosive eversion and functional morphology of the duck penis supports sexual conflict in waterfowl genitalia]. Proceedings: Biological Sciences 277, 1309–14 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male avoidance/habitat change===

Another female tactic to counter coercion is to try to avoid males that may cause them harm. To do this, females often change their habitats to get away from aggressive males, as is seen in wild Trinidadian guppies (''[[Poecilia reticulata]]'').&lt;ref name=eight /&gt; Female bottlenose dolphins behave in similar ways by moving into shallow waters where there are not too many males.&lt;ref name=eight /&gt; Other species that practice mate avoidance are ''[[Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis]]'', a species of damselfly, who often try to hide from large groups of males to avoid harassment.&lt;ref name=twenty /&gt;

Females of the marine intertidal periwinkle species (genus ''[[Littorina]]'') have another way to avoid males. Males usually recognize female snails by cues in their mucous trails. However, females try to mask their gender by altering these cues.&lt;ref name="twenty four"&gt;Johannesson, K., Saltin, S. H., Duranovic, I., Havenhand, J. N. &amp; Jonsson, P. R. [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012005 Indiscriminate males: mating behaviour of a marine snail compromised by a sexual conflict?] PLoS ONE 5, e12005 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In damselflies, females also try to mask their gender by mimicking male colors, which make them less attractive to males.&lt;ref name="twenty four" /&gt;

===Protection/alliances===

An effective female strategy is the employment of protection and alliances. Some females, such as wild Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulate) associate themselves with protective males who come to their rescue.&lt;ref name="twenty seven"&gt;Darden, S. K. &amp; Croft, D. P. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2610095/ Male harassment drives females to alter habitat use and leads to segregation of the sexes]. Biology letters 4, 449–51 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; This also occurs in hamadryas, savanna, and olive baboons, where males and females form friendships where the female gets male protection.&lt;ref name="twenty three" /&gt; In [[northern elephant seal]]s, the females give loud cries when mounted by undesirable or subordinate males, which attract dominant males to help. A similar phenomenon occurs in elephants, bighorn sheep, and fallow deer, where the females stay close to dominant males for protection.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

Females can also form alliances with other females for protection against aggressive males.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt; In African vervet monkeys, related females often form groups and “gang up” on males. Females of high rank create networks of female alliances; together, they fight away persistent suitors.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Resistance/fighting back===

Resisting males and fighting back are important tactics some species use to counter male coercion. Many females try to vigorously shake off males to dislodge them and flee; this is seen in females sepsid flies&lt;ref name=five /&gt;  and diving beetles.&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt; Sepsids also try to bend their abdomen in such a way that males cannot copulate forcefully.&lt;ref name=five /&gt; Females are especially likely to fight back when they are protecting their offspring. This is seen in mountain gorillas, red howlers, and grey langur females, where males are often infanticidal.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

Female resistance has rarely been found to be effective. Male mammals and birds are usually larger than females, and the sheer size and strength difference makes this very difficult.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt; However, it has been observed in some species, such as squirrel monkeys, patas monkeys, vervets, and captive chimpanzees, that females can “gang up” on males when they are being aggressive. They will even try to protect a female in distress. Females have even been observed to kill immigrant males in wild red colobus monkeys.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Acceptance/submission===

Sometimes, females choose not to struggle and simply acquiesce to forceful matings. This can happen when they decide that the cost of resisting would be greater than the cost of mating.&lt;ref name=twenty /&gt; They use submission to avoid further harassment or aggression, which could end in death or injury.&lt;ref name="twenty five" /&gt; This is often seen in primate species, such as chimpanzees and hamadryas baboons.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

==Female benefits==

Some possible benefits of sexual coercion for females have been hypothesized.

===Proximate===

A possible proximate benefit for females is that sometimes after a male mates with a female, he becomes her mate. Then, he would defend and protect her.&lt;ref name=twenty /&gt; This is seen in many primate species.&lt;ref name="twenty eight" /&gt;

===Ultimate===

A possible benefit of sexual coercion that would come out in the long run is the “good genes” hypothesis.&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt; If males can overcome a female’s resistance, then they must possess good genes that would increase the survival, mating success, and ultimately the fitness of her offspring. The hypothesis is that females can use the sexual coercion process to assess the quality of a male.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

==Consequences==

===Coevolutionary arms race===

Sexual coercion often leads to an intersexual coevolutionary arms race. This consists of females evolving adaptations to male advances and males evolving counter-adaptations as a response.&lt;ref name=two /&gt; Males persist in violent behavior, which favors the evolution of female resistance to defend themselves.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;&lt;ref name=six /&gt; In organisms where males have genitalia harmful to females, such as in certain insects, females tend to evolve thicker, less sensitive copulatory tracts.&lt;ref name=six /&gt; Also, they may evolve shield over their genital openings to prevent intromission.&lt;ref name=thirteen /&gt; Females of some species of water striders have evolved protection from forceful insemination, such as abdominal spines and downward-bent abdomens to make it harder for males to mate. In response, however, males have counter evolved, also changing the shape of their abdomens to those that would facilitate forceful mating.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

The male waterfowl (Aves: Anatidae) evolution of a phallus to forcefully copulate with females has led to counteradaptations in females in the form of vaginal structures called dead end sacs and clockwise coils. These structures make it harder for males to achieve intromission. The clockwise coils are significant because the male phallus everts out of their body in a counter-clockwise spiral; therefore, a clockwise vaginal structure would impede forceful copulation. Studies have shown that the longer a male’s phallus is, the more elaborate the vaginal structures were.&lt;ref name=sixteen /&gt;

===Speciation===

Speciation has been observed to be a possible consequence of sexual coercion. In diving beetle species family [[Dytiscidae]], an intersexual arms race occurs between males and females. Males have evolved suction cup structures on their forelegs to help grasp females; females have counter-evolved setose dorsal furrows to impede forceful copulation. This continuous evolution (in both the forward and reverse directions) has led to the recent speciation of ''A. japonicus'' and ''A. kishii'', where females of ''A. kishii'' have lost their dorsal furrows while those of ''A. japonicus'' have not.&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt;

===Sexual dimorphism===

Sexual coercion can lead to sexual dimorphisms, in which males and females have significant morphological differences. For example, in some species, larger males are more successful in forcefully mating/insemination, leading to a higher fitness.&lt;ref name=two /&gt; In [[common garter snake|red-sided garter snake]]s, ''Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis'', it has been shown that heavier-bodied males were better courters and their size gave them an advantage over smaller bodied snakes.&lt;ref name=fourteen /&gt; This helps lead to an evolution of sexual dimorphism, with males larger than females.&lt;ref name=two /&gt; In other species, males that are smaller than females have higher fitness. Basically, many sex-specific morphological adaptations (for example, in Dytiscidae diving beetles, females have setose dorsal furrows that males do not and males have suction cups on their forelegs that females do not&lt;ref name=fifteen /&gt;) are sexual dimorphisms caused by sexual coercion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11165">A '''spaghetti plot''' (also known as a '''spaghetti chart''', '''spaghetti diagram''', or '''spaghetti model''') is a method of viewing data to visualize possible flows through systems.

Visualizing flow in this manner can reduce inefficiency within the flow of a system.  In regards to animal populations and [[weather buoy]]s drifting through the [[ocean]], they are drawn to study distribution and migration patterns.  Within [[meteorology]], these diagrams can help determine confidence in a specific [[weather forecast]], as well as positions and intensities of [[high-pressure area|high]] and [[low-pressure area|low pressure]] systems.  They are composed of deterministic forecasts from [[atmospheric model]]s or their various ensemble members.  Within [[medicine]], they can illustrate the effects of drugs on patients during drug trials.

===Meteorology===
[[File:Nov192001h5spaghetti5640m.png|thumb|right|Spaghetti plot of ten NCEP global ensemble members at the 500 hPa pressure level for a 3.5 day forecast.  Areas of greatest uncertainty are circled in red]]
Within meteorology, spaghetti diagrams are normally drawn from [[ensemble forecasting|ensemble forecast]]s.  A [[meteorological]] variable e.g. [[pressure]], [[temperature]], or [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] amount is drawn on a chart for a number of slightly different model runs from an ensemble. The model can then be stepped forward in time and the results compared and be used to gauge the amount of uncertainty in the forecast.  If there is good agreement and the contours follow a recognizable pattern through the sequence, then the confidence in the forecast can be high. Conversely, if the pattern is chaotic, i.e., resembling a plate of [[spaghetti]], then confidence will be low.  Ensemble members will generally diverge over time and spaghetti plots are a quick way to see when this happens.

Spaghetti plots can be a more favorable choice compared to the mean-spread ensemble in determining the intensity of a coming [[cyclone]], [[anticyclone]], or upper level ridge or trough.  Because ensemble forecasts naturally diverge as the days progress, the projected locations of meteorological features will spread further apart.  A mean-spread diagram will take a mean of the calculated pressure from each spot on the map as calculated by each permutation in the ensemble, thus effectively smoothing out the projected low and making it appear broader in size but weaker in intensity than the ensemble's permutations had actually indicated.  It can also depict two features instead of one if the ensemble clustering is around two different solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/gmb/ens/spaghetti/spag_frame.htm|title=NCEP Medium-Range Ensemble Forecast (MREF) System Spaghetti Diagrams|author=[[Environmental Modeling Center]]|date=2003-08-21|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steven Francis Moore''' (born September 22, 1978) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] former professional [[ice hockey]] [[Center (ice hockey)|center]] who played in parts of three [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) seasons with the [[Colorado Avalanche]].

Moore is widely known for suffering a career-ending injury as a result of [[Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident|an on-ice attack from behind]] by then-[[Vancouver Canucks]] forward [[Todd Bertuzzi]] in 2004. The fall-out from the event has contributed to a growing effort to curb gratuitous violence in hockey, and professional sports in general.

==Playing career ==
Steve Moore was drafted by the [[Colorado Avalanche]] in the [[1998 NHL Entry Draft]] in the second round, the 53rd pick overall. Moore played in 69 games for the Avalanche from 2001 to 2004, scoring five goals and seven assists, all of which were scored in the latter season, before being seriously injured by [[Todd Bertuzzi]] who at the time played for the [[Vancouver Canucks]] (see below). At the time of the incident, the Avalanche were first overall in the NHL standings, and Moore was playing on the Avalanche's top line, on Right Wing, with linemates [[Joe Sakic]] (Center), and [[Paul Kariya]] (Left Wing).

=== The Bertuzzi incident ===
{{main|Todd Bertuzzi–Steve Moore incident}}
On February 16, 2004, during a Vancouver-Colorado game, Moore injured Canucks team captain [[Markus Näslund]] with a high hit while Näslund was reaching for a puck through centre ice. Moore contacted Näslund's head in the play. No penalty was called in connection with the hit, but Näslund suffered a concussion and a bone chip in his elbow as a result, and missed three games. After reviewing tapes of the hit, the NHL ruled that the hit was legal and did not fine or suspend Moore. Canucks head coach [[Marc Crawford]] and general manager [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]] publicly criticized the non-call by the referees on the incident. 

During the next game between the Canucks and Avalanche held in Denver, NHL commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] and NHL executive vice-president [[Colin Campbell (ice hockey executive)|Colin Campbell]] attended the game, which ended in a tie and saw no major incidents break out.

However, on March 8, 2004, during another rematch between the Avalanche and Canucks, things went differently. In the first period, Moore fought Vancouver player [[Matt Cooke]] in a fairly even brawl, and served the 5-minute penalty for fighting. The Avalanche would go on to build up a large lead of 8-2 in a fight-filled game. Late in the third period, [[Todd Bertuzzi]] was sent onto the ice. After failing to instigate Moore to fight, Bertuzzi skated after Moore, pulled him back by the jersey and punched him in the back of the head. As Moore fell unconscious to the ice, Bertuzzi's weight and momentum drove Moore's head into the ice.  Moore's teammate [[Andrei Nikolishin]] and Bertuzzi's teammate [[Sean Pronger]] then piled on to Moore and Bertuzzi.  Moore was knocked out and lay motionless for ten minutes before being carried off on a [[stretcher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=240308022 ESPN Game Summary. 28th March 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the hit, fall, and piling-on had resulted in three fractured [[Cervical vertebrae|neck vertebrae]], facial cuts and a [[concussion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070309/steve_moore_070309/20070309?hub%3DCanada |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318025304/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070309/steve_moore_070309/20070309?hub=Canada |archivedate=2007-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bertuzzi was assessed a match penalty for his actions, which carries an automatic indefinite suspension under NHL rules.  On March 11, 2004, the NHL announced Bertuzzi would remain suspended for at least the remainder of the Canucks' season, including any playoff games.  The [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]] subsequently honoured the NHL suspension, preventing Bertuzzi playing in any international tournaments or leagues during the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]].

On August 22, 2004, Moore was released from a Denver-area hospital. He wore a neck [[brace (orthopaedic)|brace]] for one year and then started [[physical therapy]] for his neck injury and concussion.

On February 17, 2005, Moore filed a civil lawsuit against Bertuzzi. Also named were [[Brad May]] (who was quoted as saying that there would  "definitely be a bounty on Moore's head" after the game), Brian Burke and the Canucks organization. The lawsuit was thrown out in October 2005, with the judge suggesting that the lawsuit be re-filed in Canada, where the incident took place. The lawsuit was re-filed in Canada, in February 2006.&lt;ref name="MooreLawsuit"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=142413&amp;hubname=nhl |title=Moore plans to file appeal in civil case |accessdate=2007-11-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929173940/http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=142413&amp;hubname=nhl |archivedate=2007-09-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On August 8, 2005, NHL Commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] announced that Bertuzzi would be allowed to play again at the start of the [[2005–06 NHL season]].&lt;ref name="Reinstatement"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nhl.com/news/2005/08/232342.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719003929/http://www.nhl.com/news/2005/08/232342.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-19 |title=NHL reinstates Vancouver's Todd Bertuzzi |accessdate=2007-02-27 |publisher=NHL.com |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the league's decision, they cited many reasons for ending the suspension, such as: 
*Bertuzzi serving a suspension of 20 games, which at the time tied for 4th longest in NHL history (13 regular season games, 7 playoff games)&lt;ref name="SuspensionLength"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proicehockey.about.com/cs/history/a/nhl_suspensions.htm|title=The Longest NHL Suspensions|accessdate=2007-11-21|author=Fitzpatrick, Jamie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bertuzzi's forfeited salary ($501,926.39 [[United States dollar|USD]])
*Significant uncertainty, anxiety, stress and emotional pain caused to Bertuzzi's family
*The commissioner's belief that Bertuzzi was genuinely remorseful and apologetic for his actions

On August 12, 2005, Brian Burke, formerly Vancouver's general manager who was now serving in the same capacity with the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, had made an offer to Moore. It was a [[two-way contract]] that would have paid Moore $475,000 US in the NHL and $75,000 if the player suited up for Portland, the Ducks' [[American Hockey League]] affiliate. Moore's lawyer Tim Danson described the offer as a self-serving attempt by Burke (who was a defendant in the lawsuit) to mitigate potential legal damages, by attempting to suggest Moore was a minor league player. Further, Danson said that Moore would return to the Avalanche except that Moore was not medically cleared to play hockey, which Brian Burke was well aware of, and described it as adding insult to injury.

On August 15, 2005, Bertuzzi broke his 17-month-long silence by expressing a desire to move on with his life. "I'm sure just like Steve Moore and his family, it's been difficult for both parties. I know I wish that day never happened. It's been some tough times, but I've got good family and good friends and good peers in the league that have helped me get over the hump and move forward and come through it."&lt;ref name="Never happened"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2134946|title=Bertuzzi: 'I wish that day never happened'|accessdate=2007-02-27|publisher=ESPN.com|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 8, 2005, Moore's Toronto-based lawyer, Tim Danson, said that Moore was skating and doing regular workouts, but continued to suffer concussion-related symptoms.&lt;ref name="MooreLawsuit"/&gt;  He continued working out for some years afterward, but had to abandon his comeback attempt when it became apparent he would never be medically cleared to return to the ice again.

In July, 2012, former Avalanche [[Enforcer (ice hockey)|enforcer]] [[Scott Parker (ice hockey)|Scott Parker]], who had been a teammate of Moore's very briefly the season prior to the Bertuzzi incident in 2004, made some controversial comments. In an interview with milehighhockey.com, Parker was quoted as saying "he (Moore) went to Harvard, you know what, blow me. College grad. I never went to college, but I can kick your ass. I'll bring you right down to my IQ level if you want. I'll hit you about four times in the skull, that'll bring you right down." &lt;ref&gt;An Afternoon With Former Avalanche Enforcer Scott Parker: Part 2 http://www.milehighhockey.com/2012/7/18/3151979/an-afternoon-with-former-avalanche-enforcer-scott-parker-part-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker defends Bertuzzi attack http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/NHL/2012/07/18/20001901.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil lawsuit====

On February 16, 2006, Moore filed a civil suit in the province of [[Ontario]] against Bertuzzi, the Canucks, and the parent company of the Canucks, ''Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment'' for the loss of his NHL career, in his Rookie Year. The lawsuit was seeking $15 million in pecuniary damages for loss of income, $1 million for aggravated damages, and $2 million for punitive damages. Moore's lawyer filed the suit one day before its two-year limitation expired, saying it was because Steve Moore did not want to file the suit and waited until the last minute while he tried to attain medical clearance to resume his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2006/02/15/bertuzzi060215.html | publisher = [[CBC News]] | date = 2006-02-15 | title = Bertuzzi hit with lawsuit | accessdate = 2009-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bettman attempted to get Bertuzzi and Moore to agree on an out-of-court settlement in the {{currency|19.5 million|CAD}} lawsuit filed by Moore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/story/9873254 Pittsburgh Penguins, Sidney Crosby, National Hockey League - CBSSports.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207061223/http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/story/9873254 |date=2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bertuzzi offered $350,000 to settle the case, an amount which was called "an insult" by Moore's lawyer.&lt;ref name="Insult"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/Sports/article/273827|title=Bertuzzi offered Moore $350,000|accessdate=2007-11-21|author=Westhead, Rick | work=The Star | location=Toronto | date=November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2008, Bertuzzi filed a lawsuit against Crawford, alleging that he was contractually obliged to obey Crawford and that therefore Crawford shares responsibility for the injury to Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crawford brought into Moore lawsuit|url=http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080328.wsptbert28/GSStory/GlobeSportsHockey/home|accessdate=2008-08-19|date=2008-03-28|publisher=Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Crawford later stated that Bertuzzi acted in "direct disobedience" to orders from the bench to get off the ice before attacking Moore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bertuzzi acted in 'direct disobedience': Crawford|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2008/08/19/nhl-bertuzzi-crawford.html|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=2008-08-19|date=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 14, 2013, The Toronto Star reported that both Moore v. Bertuzzi, et al. and Bertuzzi v. Crawford would begin, after having been postponed several times, in April 2013. Both cases will be held in the Ontario Superior Court before a six-person jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/nhl/article/1314614--bertuzzi-moore-court-documents-shed-light-on-ex-nhl-player-s-struggles|title=

On January 4, 2012, Bertuzzi dropped his third-party lawsuit against Crawford. In the month of October 2013, it was announced that the court date for Moore v. Bertuzzi, et al. will begin on September 8, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2014/03/07/steve-moore-todd-bertuzzi-case-reaches-its-10-year-anniversary-without-final-resolution/ |title=Steve Moore-Todd Bertuzzi case reaches its 10-year anniversary without final resolution |work=The National Post |author=Sean Fitz-Gerald |date=March 9, 2014 |accessdate=May 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140507064348/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2014/03/07/steve-moore-todd-bertuzzi-case-reaches-its-10-year-anniversary-without-final-resolution/ |archivedate=May 7, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2014, Moore's lawsuit was amended, seeking $68 million in damages, up from $38 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/steve-moore-makes-1st-appearance-at-civil-trial-vs-todd-bertuzzi-1.2694464 | title=Steve Moore makes 1st appearance at civil trial vs. Todd Bertuzzi | publisher=''[[CBC.ca]]'' | author=Michael Drapack | date=July 2, 2014 | accessdate=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 19, 2014, it was announced that an out-of-court settlement had been reached in Steve Moore's lawsuit.

==Personal ==
Steve Moore's older brother [[Mark Moore (ice hockey)|Mark]], and younger brother, [[Dominic Moore|Dominic]], all played four years at [[Harvard University]]. Because of their relative closeness in age, all three were able to play in the same year for Harvard during the 1999–2000 season. Dominic also went on to play in the NHL.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Syncope''', also known as '''fainting''', is a loss of [[consciousness]] and muscle strength characterized by a fast onset, short duration, and spontaneous recovery.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; It is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the [[brain]], typically from [[hypotension|low blood pressure]].&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; There are sometimes [[prodrome|symptoms before the loss of consciousness]] such as lightheadedness, [[diaphoresis|sweating]], [[pale skin]], blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, or feeling warm.&lt;!-- &lt;re name=EB2014/&gt; --&gt; Syncope may also be associated with a short episode of muscle twitching.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; When consciousness and muscle strength are not completely lost, it is called [[presyncope]].&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; It is recommended that presyncope be treated the same as syncope.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
Causes range from non-serious to potentially fatal.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; There are three broad categories of causes: [[heart]] or [[blood vessel]] related, [[reflex syncope|reflex]] also known as [[Nervous system|neurally]] mediated, and [[orthostatic hypotension]].&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Issues with the heart and blood vessels are the cause in about 10% and typically the most serious while neurally mediated is the most common.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Heart related causes may include an [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythm]], problems with the [[heart valve]]s or heart muscle and blockages of blood vessels from a [[pulmonary embolism]] or [[aortic dissection]] among others.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Neurally mediated syncope occurs when blood vessels expand and [[bradycardia|heart rate decreases]] inappropriately.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; This may occur from either a triggering event such as exposure to blood, pain, strong feelings or a specific activity such as [[urination]], [[vomiting]], or [[coughing]].&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; This type of syncope may also occur when an area in the neck known as the [[carotid sinus]] is pressed.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; The third type of syncope is due to a drop in blood pressure from standing up.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; This is often due to medications that a person is taking but may also be related to [[dehydration]], significant bleeding or [[infection]].&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Diagnosis and management --&gt;
A medical history, physical examination, and [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) are the most effective ways to figure out the underlying cause.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; The ECG is useful to detect an abnormal heart rhythm, [[coronary artery disease|poor blood flow to the heart muscle]], and other electrical issue such as [[long QT syndrome]] and [[Brugada syndrome]].&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Heart related causes also often have little history of a [[prodrome]].&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Low blood pressure and a fast heart rate after the event may indicate blood loss or dehydration, while [[Hypoxia (medical)|low blood oxygen levels]] may be seen following the event in those with pulmonary embolism.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; More specific tests such as [[implantable loop recorder]]s, [[tilt table testing]] or [[carotid sinus massage]] may be useful in uncertain cases.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; [[Computer tomography|Computed tomography]] (CT) is generally not required unless specific concerns are present.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Other causes of similar symptoms that should be considered include [[seizure]], [[stroke]], [[concussion]], [[Hypoxia (medical)|low blood oxygen]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[drug intoxication]] and some psychiatric disorders among others.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Treatment depends on the underlying cause.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; Those who are considered at high risk following investigation may be admitted to hospital for further [[telemetry|monitoring of the heart]].&lt;ref name=EB2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peeters|first1=SY|last2=Hoek|first2=AE|last3=Mollink|first3=SM|last4=Huff|first4=JS|title=Syncope: risk stratification and clinical decision making.|journal=Emergency medicine practice|date=April 2014|volume=16|issue=4|pages=1-22; quiz 22-3|pmid=25105200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and prognosis--&gt;
Syncope affects about three to six out of every thousand people each year.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; It is more common in older people and females.&lt;ref name=Kenny2013/&gt; It is the reason for one to three percent of visits to emergency departments and admissions to hospital.&lt;ref name=Kenny2013/&gt; Up to half of women over the age of 80 and a third of medical students describe at least one event at some point in their life.&lt;ref name=Kenny2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenny|first1=RA|last2=Bhangu|first2=J|last3=King-Kallimanis|first3=BL|title=Epidemiology of syncope/collapse in younger and older Western patient populations.|journal=Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases|date=2013|volume=55|issue=4|pages=357–63|pmid=23472771|doi=10.1016/j.pcad.2012.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those presenting with syncope to an emergency department, about 4% died in the next 30 days.&lt;ref name=EB2014/&gt; The risk of a poor outcome, however, depends very much on the underlying cause.&lt;ref name=Ru2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruwald|first1=MH|title=Epidemiological studies on syncope--a register based approach.|journal=Danish Medical Journal|date=August 2013|volume=60|issue=8|pages=B4702|pmid=24063058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differential diagnosis==

===Central nervous system ischemia===
The central ischemic response is triggered by an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood in the brain.

The respiratory system may contribute to oxygen levels through [[hyperventilation]], though a sudden ischaemic episode may also proceed faster than the respiratory system can respond.  These processes cause the typical symptoms of fainting: pale skin,  rapid breathing, nausea and weakness of the limbs, particularly of the legs. If the ischaemia is intense or prolonged, limb weakness progresses to collapse.  An individual with very little skin pigmentation may appear to have all color drained from his or her face at the onset of an episode. This effect combined with the following collapse can make a strong and dramatic impression on bystanders.

The weakness of the legs causes most sufferers to sit or lie down if there is time to do so. This may avert a complete collapse, but whether the sufferer sits down or falls down, the result of an ischaemic episode is a posture in which less blood pressure is required to achieve adequate blood flow.  It is unclear whether this is a mechanism evolved in response to the circulatory difficulties of human bipedalism or merely a serendipitous result of a pre-existing circulatory response.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

====Vertebro-basilar arterial disease====
Arterial disease in the upper spinal cord, or lower brain, causes syncope if there is a reduction in blood supply, which may occur with extending the neck or after drugs to lower blood pressure.

===Vasovagal===
{{main|Vasovagal syncope}}
Vasovagal (situational) syncope is one of the most common types which may occur in response to any of a variety of triggers, such as scary, embarrassing or uneasy situations, during blood drawing, or moments of sudden unusually high stress. There are many different syncope syndromes which all fall under the umbrella of vasovagal syncope related by the same central mechanism, such as urination ("[[micturition syncope]]"), defecation ("defecation syncope"), and others related to trauma and stress.

Vasovagal syncope can be considered in two forms:
*Isolated episodes of loss of consciousness, unheralded by any warning symptoms for more than a few moments. These tend to occur in the adolescent age group, and may be associated with fasting, exercise, abdominal straining, or circumstances promoting vaso-dilation (e.g., heat, alcohol). The subject is invariably upright. The [[tilt-table test]], if performed, is generally negative.
*Recurrent syncope with complex associated symptoms. This is neurally mediated syncope (NMS). It is associated with any of the following: preceding or succeeding sleepiness, preceding visual disturbance ("spots before the eyes"), sweating, lightheadedness. The subject is usually but not always upright. The tilt-table test, if performed, is generally positive. It is relatively uncommon.

A pattern of background factors contributes to the attacks. There is typically an unsuspected relatively low blood volume, for instance, from taking a low-salt diet in the absence of any salt-retaining tendency. Heat causes vaso-dilation and worsens the effect of the relatively insufficient blood volume. The next stage is the adrenergic response. If there is underlying fear or anxiety (e.g., social circumstances), or acute fear (e.g., acute threat, [[Trypanophobia|needle phobia]]), the vaso-motor centre demands an increased pumping action by the heart (flight or fight response). This is set in motion via the adrenergic (sympathetic) outflow from the brain, but the heart is unable to meet requirement because of the low blood volume, or decreased return. The high (ineffective) sympathetic activity is always modulated by vagal outflow, in these cases leading to excessive slowing of heart rate. The abnormality lies in this excessive vagal response. The tilt-table test typically evokes the attack.

Much of this pathway was discovered in animal experiments by Bezold (Vienna) in the 1860s. In animals, it may represent a defence mechanism when confronted by danger ("playing possum").

Avoiding what brings on the syncope and possibly greater salt intake is often all that is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaufmann|first1=H|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=K|title=Diagnosis and treatment of neurally mediated syncope.|journal=The Neurologist|date=May 2002|volume=8|issue=3|pages=175–85|pmid=12803689|doi=10.1097/00127893-200205000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychological factors also have been found to mediate syncope.  It is important for general practitioners and the psychologist in their primary care team to work closely together, and to help patients identify how they might be avoiding activities of daily living due to anticipatory anxiety in relation to a possible faint and the feared physical damage it may cause.  Fainting in response to a blood stimulus, needle or a dead body are common and patients can quickly develop safety behaviours to avoid any recurrences of a fainting response.

An [[evolutionary psychology]] view is that some forms of fainting are non-verbal signals that developed in response to increased inter-group aggression during the [[paleolithic]]. A non-combatant who has fainted signals that she or he is not a threat. This would explain the  association between fainting and stimuli such as bloodletting and injuries seen in [[blood-injection-injury type phobia]]s such as [[needle phobia]] as well as the gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bracha HS |title=Human brain evolution and the 'Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:' Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Prog.

====Deglutition (Swallowing) syncope====
Syncope may occur during [[deglutition]].  Manisty et al. note: "Deglutition syncope is characterised by loss of consciousness on swallowing; it has been associated not only with ingestion of solid food, but also with carbonated and ice-cold beverages, and even belching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manisty C, Hughes-Roberts Y, Kaddoura S |date=July 2009 |title=Cardiac manifestations and sequelae of gastrointestinal disorders |journal=Br J Cardiol |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=175–80 |url=http://bjcardio.co.uk/2009/07/cardiac-manifestations-and-sequelae-of-gastrointestinal-disorders/ |accessdate=11 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611075350/http://bjcardio.co.uk/2009/07/cardiac-manifestations-and-sequelae-of-gastrointestinal-disorders/ |archivedate=11 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardiac ===
[[File:Blausen 0100 Bradycardia Fainting.png|thumb|Syncope from bradycardia]]

====Cardiac arrhythmias====
The most common cause of cardiac syncope is cardiac [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] (abnormal [[heart]] rhythm) wherein the heart beats too slowly, too rapidly, or too irregularly to pump enough blood to the brain. Some arrhythmias can be life-threatening.

Two major groups of arrhythmias are [[bradycardia]] and [[tachycardia]]. Bradycardia can be caused by [[heart block]]s.  Tachycardias include SVT ([[supraventricular tachycardia]]) and VT ([[ventricular tachycardia]]). SVT does not cause syncope except in [[Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome]]. [[Ventricular tachycardia]] originate in the ventricles. VT causes syncope and can result in sudden death. Ventricular tachycardia, which describes a heart rate of over 100 beats per minute with at least three irregular heartbeats as a sequence of consecutive premature beats, can degenerate into [[ventricular fibrillation]], which is rapidly fatal without [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) and [[defibrillation]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Typically, tachycardic-generated syncope is caused by a cessation of beats following a tachycardic episode.  This condition, called tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, is usually caused by sinoatrial node dysfunction or block or [[atrioventricular block]].&lt;ref name=Harrisons18&gt;{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=Roy |editor1-first=Dan L. |editor1-last=Longo |editor2-first=Dennis L. |editor2-last=Kasper |editor3-first=J.

====Obstructive cardiac lesion====
[[Aortic stenosis]] and [[mitral stenosis]] are the most common examples.  Aortic stenosis presents with repeated episodes of syncope.  A [[pulmonary embolism]] can cause obstructed blood vessels and is the cause of syncope in less than 1% of people who present to the emergency department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oqab|first1=Zardasht|last2=Ganshorn|first2=Heather|last3=Sheldon|first3=Robert|title=Prevalence of pulmonary embolism in patients presenting with syncope.

====Structural cardiopulmonary disease====
These are relatively infrequent causes of fainting. The most common cause in this category is fainting associated with an acute myocardial infarction or ischemic event. The faint in this case is primarily caused by an abnormal nervous system reaction similar to the reflex faints. In general, faints caused by structural disease of the heart or blood vessels are particularly important to recognize, as they are warning of potentially life-threatening conditions. Among other conditions prone to trigger syncope (by either hemodynamic compromise or by a neural reflex mechanism, or both), some of the most important are [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]], acute aortic dissection, pericardial tamponade, pulmonary embolism, aortic stenosis, and [[pulmonary hypertension]].

====Other cardiac causes====
[[Sick sinus syndrome]], a sinus node dysfunction, causing alternating bradycardia and tachycardia.  Often there is a long pause asystole between heartbeat.

[[Adams-Stokes syndrome]] is a cardiac syncope that occurs with seizures caused by complete or incomplete heart block. Symptoms include deep and fast respiration, weak and slow pulse and respiratory pauses that may last for 60 seconds.

[[Subclavian steal syndrome]] arises from retrograde (reversed) flow of blood in the vertebral artery or the internal thoracic artery, due to a proximal stenosis (narrowing) and/or occlusion of the subclavian artery.

[[Aortic dissection]] (a tear in the aorta) and [[cardiomyopathy]] can also result in syncope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Nallamothu BK, Mehta RH, Saint S, etal |title=Syncope in acute aortic dissection: diagnostic, prognostic, and clinical implications |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=113 |issue=6 |pages=468–71 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12427495 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9343(02)01254-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various medications, such as [[beta blocker]]s, may cause bradycardia induced syncope.&lt;ref name=Harrisons18/&gt;

===Blood pressure===
[[Orthostatic hypotension|''Orthostatic (postural) hypotensive faint''s]] are as common or perhaps even more common than vasovagal syncope. Orthostatic faints are most often associated with movement from lying or sitting to a standing position, standing up too quickly, or being in a very hot room. The classic example of a combination of these is seen in the frequent fainting by medical students in the operating theatre during observation of surgery.&lt;ref name=Jamjoom2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jamjoom AA, Nikkar-Esfahani A, Fitzgerald JE |title=Operating theatre related syncope in medical students: a cross sectional study |journal=BMC Med Educ |volume=9|pages=14 |year=2009 |pmid=19284564 |pmc=2657145 |doi=10.1186/1472-6920-9-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently healthy individuals may experience minor symptoms ("lightheadedness", "greying-out") as they stand up if blood pressure is slow to respond to the stress of upright posture. If the blood pressure is not adequately maintained during standing, faints may develop. However, the resulting "transient orthostatic hypotension" does not necessarily signal any serious underlying disease.

The most susceptible individuals are elderly frail individuals, or persons who are dehydrated from hot environments or inadequate fluid intake. More serious orthostatic hypotension is often the result of certain commonly prescribed medications such as diuretics, β-adrenergic blockers, other anti-hypertensives (including vasodilators), and [[nitroglycerin]]. In a small percentage of cases, the cause of orthostatic hypotensive faints is structural damage to the [[autonomic nervous system]] due to systemic diseases (e.g., [[amyloidosis]] or diabetes) or in neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease).

===Other causes===
Factors that influence fainting are fasting long hours, taking in too little food and fluids, low [[blood pressure]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[G-LOC|high g-force]], emotional distress, and lack of sleep.

One theory in [[evolutionary psychology]] is that fainting at the sight of blood might have evolved as a form of [[Apparent death|playing dead]] which increased survival from attackers and might have slowed blood loss in a primitive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-babble/201302/why-do-some-people-faint-the-sight-blood |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20160801224802/http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain%2Dbabble/201302/why%2Ddo%2Dsome%2Dpeople%2Dfaint%2Dthe%2Dsight%2Dblood |archivedate=2017-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Blood-injury phobia", as this is called, is experienced by about 15% of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/swoon-at-the-sight-of-blood|title=Swoon at the Sight of Blood?

Fainting can occur in "cough syncope" following severe fits of [[cough]]ing, such as that associated with [[pertussis]] or "whooping cough."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dicpinigaitis PV, Lim L, Farmakidis C |title=Cough syncope.|journal=Respiratory Medicine |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=244–51|date=February 2014 |pmid=24238768 |pmc=|doi=10.1016/j.rmed.2013.10.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnostic approach==
A [[hemoglobin]] count may indicate anemia or blood loss. However, this has been useful in only about 5% of people evaluated for fainting.&lt;ref&gt;Grubb (2001) p.83&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[electrocardiogram]] (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart. It is estimated that from 20%-50% of people have an abnormal ECG. However, while an ECG may identify conditions such as [[atrial fibrillation]], heart block, or a new or old heart attack, it typically does not provide a definite diagnosis for the underlying cause for fainting.&lt;ref&gt;Grubb (2001) pp.83-84&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, a [[Holter monitor]] may be used. This is a portable ECG device that can record the wearer's heart rhythms during daily activities over an extended period of time. Since fainting usually does not occur upon command, a Holter monitor can provide a better understanding of the heart's activity during fainting episodes.

The [[tilt table test]] is performed to elicit orthostatic syncope secondary to autonomic dysfunction (neurogenic).

For people with more than two episodes of syncope and no diagnosis on “routine testing”, an insertable cardiac monitor might be used. It lasts 28–36 months. Smaller than a pack of gum, it is inserted just beneath the skin in the upper chest area. The procedure typically takes 15 to 20 minutes. Once inserted, the device continuously monitors the rate and rhythm of the heart. Upon waking from a “fainting” spell, the patient places a hand held pager-sized device called an Activator over the implanted device and simply presses a button. This information is stored and retrieved by their physician and some devices can be monitored remotely.

===Imaging===
For people with uncomplicated syncope (without seizures and a normal neurological exam) [[computed tomography]] or [[MRI]] is not generally indicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Moya A, Sutton R, Ammirati F, etal |title=Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) |journal=Eur.

&lt;/ref&gt; Although sometimes investigated as a cause of syncope, carotid artery problems are unlikely to cause that condition.&lt;ref name="AANfive"/&gt; Additionally an [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) is generally not recommended.&lt;ref name=Wise2018&gt;{{cite web |title=American Epilepsy Society Choosing Wisely |url=http://www.choosingwisely.org/societies/american-epilepsy-society/ |website=www.choosingwisely.org |accessdate=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Francisco syncope rule===
The [[San Francisco Syncope Rule|San Francisco syncope rule]] was developed to isolate people who have higher risk for a serious cause of syncope. High risk is anyone who has: congestive heart failure, hematocrit &lt;30%, electrocardiograph abnormality, shortness of breath, or systolic blood pressure &lt;90&amp;nbsp;mmHg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Quinn J, McDermott D, Stiell I, Kohn M, Wells G |title=Prospective validation of the San Francisco Syncope Rule to predict patients with serious outcomes |journal=Ann Emerg Med |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=448–54 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16631985 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2005.11.019 |laysummary=http://emergency-medicine.jwatch.org/cgi/content/full/2006/721/2 |laysource=Journal Watch |laydate=July 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The San Francisco syncope rule however was not validated by subsequent studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Birnbaum A, Esses D, Bijur P, Wollowitz A, Gallagher EJ |title=Failure to validate the San Francisco Syncope Rule in an independent emergency department population |journal=Ann Emerg Med |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=151–9 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18282636 |doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2007.12.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Recommended acute treatment of vasovagal and orthostatic (hypotension) syncope involves returning blood to the brain by positioning the person on the ground, with legs slightly elevated or leaning forward and the head between the knees for at least 10–15 minutes, preferably in a cool and quiet place. For individuals who have problems with chronic fainting spells, therapy should focus on recognizing the triggers and learning techniques to keep from fainting. At the appearance of warning signs such as lightheadedness, nausea, or cold and clammy skin, counter-pressure maneuvers that involve gripping fingers into a fist, tensing the arms, and crossing the legs or squeezing the thighs together can be used to ward off a fainting spell.  After the symptoms have passed, [[sleep]] is recommended. If fainting spells occur often without a triggering event, syncope may be a sign of an underlying heart disease. In case syncope is caused by cardiac disease, the treatment is much more sophisticated than that of [[vasovagal]] syncope and may involve [[artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemakers]] and [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillators]] depending on the precise cardiac cause.

==Society and culture==
Fainting in women was a commonplace trope or stereotype in [[Victorian England]] and in contemporary and modern depictions of the period.

[[Falling-out]] is a [[culture-bound syndrome]] primarily reported in the [[southern United States]] and the [[Caribbean]].

Some individuals occasionally or frequently play the "[[fainting game]]" (also referred to in the US as the "choking game"), which involves the deliberate induction of syncope via voluntary restriction of blood flow to the brain, an action that can result in acute or cumulative brain damage and even death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://wjz.com/local/local_story_307223858.html | title = 'Choking Game' Becoming Deadly Fad For Adolescents | accessdate = 2008-02-13 | date = 2005-11-04 | publisher = WJZ-TV Baltimore |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071219064633/http://wjz.com/local/local_story_307223858.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology ===
{{more citations needed|date=October 2011}}

The term is derived from the [[Latin language|Late Latin]] ''syncope'', from [[Ancient Greek]] συγκοπή (''sunkopē'') 'cutting up', 'sudden loss of strength', from σύν (''sun'', "together, thoroughly") and κόπτειν (''koptein'', "strike, cut off").

==Relations to Systems Biology==
Systems chemistry is a relatively young sub-discipline of [[chemistry]], where the focus does not lie on the individual chemical components but rather on the overall network of interacting molecules and on their emergent properties. Hence, it combines the classical knowledge of chemistry (structure, reactions and interactions of molecules) together with a systems approach inspired by [[systems biology]] and [[systems science]].

==History==
While multicomponent reactions have been studied for centuries, the idea of deliberately analyzing mixtures and reaction networks is more recent. The first mentions of systems chemistry as a field date from 2005 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Stankiewicz | last2=Eckardt |year= 2006| title = Chembiogenesis 2005 and Systems Chemistry Workshop | journal = Angew.

Early adopters focused on prebiotic chemistry combined with [[supramolecular chemistry]], before it was generalized to the study of emergent properties and functions of any complex molecular systems. A 2017 review in the field of systems chemistry &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Ashkenasy |last2=Taylor |year= 2017| title = Systems Chemistry | journal = Chem. Soc.

==Examples==
[[Dynamic combinatorial chemistry]] has been used as a method to develop ligands for biomolecules and receptors for small molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li |last2=Otto |year= 2013| title = Dynamic Combinatorial Libraries: From Exploring Molecular Recognition to Systems Chemistry | journal = J.

Ligands that can recognize biomolecules are being identified by preparing libraries of potential ligands in the presence of a target biomacromolecule. This approach sets the stage for their application as diagnostic biosensors for fast monitoring of imbalances and illnesses and therapeutic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Verma |last2=Rotello | year= 2005 | title = Surface recognition of biomacromolecules using nanoparticle receptors | journal = Chem.

Individual components of certain chemical system will self-assemble to form receptors which are
complementary to target molecule. In principle, the preferred library members will select and
amplify based on the strongest interactions between the template and products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Kiedrowski |last2=Herdewijn |year= 2008| title = Systems chemistry | journal =  Chem.

==Molecular networks &amp; equilibrium==
A fundamental difference exists between chemistry as it is performed in most laboratories and chemistry as it occurs in life. Laboratory processes are mostly designed such that the (closed) system goes thermodynamically downhill; i.e. the product state is of lower [[Gibbs free energy]], yielding stable molecules that can be isolated and stored. Yet the chemistry of life operates in a very different way: Most molecules from which living systems are constituted are turned over continuously and are not necessarily thermodynamically stable. Nevertheless, living systems can be stable, but in a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] sense. Such homeostatic (open) systems are far-from-equilibrium and are dissipative: they need energy to maintain themselves. In dissipative controlled systems the continuous supply of energy allows a continuous transition between different supramolecular states, where systems with unexpected properties may be discovered. One of the grand challenges of Systems Chemistry is to unveil [[complex network|complex reactions networks]], where molecules continuously consume energy to perform specific functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26862">The following is a timeline of the '''[[Gwangmu Reform]]''', which was a reforms for modernize Korea from the late 19th century to the early 20th century. Although many people have the notion that this period was marked with the fight for power between Heungseon Daewongun (흥선대원군, 興宣大院君 - King Gojong's father) and Queen Min (King Gojong's wife), it was rather the era of great changes relevant to modernisation after the harsh oppressive years during the "Regency" of King Gojong's father. This reform also was one of the most successful for [[modernization|modernising]] in a short period of time during Korean history. Although the reform was mostly centred on the time period after the proclamation of the Korean Empire, it includes a number of other previous events that are closely related to the reform.

==Early modernizations (1883–94)==
Phase one of the [[Gwangmu Reform]] began with the first Korean delegation to America, and opening up for modernisation. Because of recurring Chinese interventions led by [[Li Hongzhang]] (이홍장,李鴻章), there was relatively less development of Chosun compared to Phase Three. The main innovator in this phase is [[Queen Min]].

*1883: March. The Korea-Japanese Underground Cable Construction Treaty (조일해저전선부설조약,朝日海底電線敷設條約) was signed by Korea and Japan. This led to a telegraphic connection between [[Busan]] (부산,釜山) and [[Nagasaki]] (長崎).
*1883: May. American minister [[Lucius Foote]] arrived to take command of the modernization of Chosun's older army units that had not started Westernizing. 
[[Image:Hanseong Sunbo 1883.jpg|thumb|120px|left|''[[Hanseong sunbo]]'', the first modern newspaper in Korea]]
*1883: July. The first delegate to America was sent by the Chosun government. The Ministry of Presswork and Publication (박문국,博文局)was opened for the modernisation of the printing industry.
*1883: August. The first edition of the [[Hanseong sunbo]] (한성순보,漢城旬報) was published on this year. This is the first newspaper to be published in Chosun. 
*1884: The Daedong Corporation (대동상회,大同商會), the first modern domestic corporation in Korea, was established.
*1885: February. The first Royal Medical Clinic, the '''[[Gwanghyewon]] (광혜연,廣惠院)''' was opened with the introduction of modern medicine by [[Horace Newton Allen]]. The name changed to Jaejoongwon (제중원,濟衆院) a month later.
*1885: May. [[Presbyterianism]] is introduced to Chosun by [[Horace Grant Underwood]]. Many other Christian pastors came to Chosun, which became the fundamental background for religious freedom and equality between Koreans.
*1885: July. The Korea-Chinese Cable Treaty (조청전선조약,朝淸電線條約) is signed and enforced, leading to a telegraphic connection between [[Hanseong]] and [[Peking]].
*1885: August. Establishment of the [[Pai Chai University|Baejae Hakdang]] (배재학당,培材學堂) by [[Henry Appenzeller]]. Although initially recognised as an 'Academy', it became a college in 1895.
*1886: February. Proclamation of abolishment of [[slavery]] inheritance within Chosun. This is the unofficial start of equalisation of people within the kingdom. It also paved the way for abolishment of slavery in the [[Gabo Reform]]. 
*1886: May. Queen Min gave her patronage to the first all-girls' educational institution, '''Ewha Academy (이화학당,梨花學堂) ''', established in Seoul by American missionary, [[Mary F. Scranton]]. This institution later became the [[Ewha University]] (이화여자대학교,梨花女子大學校). 
[[File:Manhwa-Yu.Gil-jun-Yahak-01.jpg|thumb|130px|right|A cartoon that shows a former [[Yangban]] and a commoner using the same speech level.]]
*1886: September. There also was the establishment of the Yukyeong-gongwon (육영공원,育英公院). This was the first [[state school|public school]] to be opened in Chosun. 
*1887: March. The Korean Imperial Telegraphic Office (조선전보총국,朝鮮電報總局) was opened for a more efficient management of the telegraphic lines operating in Korea. The office was in use until 1893, when it became into the Korean Imperial Telegraphic and Postal Office (전우총국,電郵總局).
*1887: October. American missionary Scranton establishes the first women's hospital, the Lillian Harris Memorial Hospital (보구여관,普救女館). The hospital also operated the first medical class for women. One of the students went to the Woman’s Medical College of Baltimore, becoming the first female doctor at Korea in 1900.
*1888: February. 1888, General [[William McEntyre Dye]] and two other military instructors arrived from the US, followed in May by a fourth instructor. The Americans taught at the first modern military academy called the '''Yeonmu-gongwon (연무공원,鍊武公院)''' and trained many Koreans.
*1888: May. Korea independently constructs the Southern Cable Line (남로전선,南路電線), connecting Hanseong and Busan.
*1890: January. The Korean Merchant's Association for Fairness is opened by Kim Jae-jun(김재전,金在田), Lee Gun-seo (이군서,李君瑞) and Park Myung-gyu(박명규朴明珪). The Association promoted usage of foreign weight and measurement standards in the domestic market. It had offices in Incheon, Wonsan and Busan. 
*1891: February. The Korean Northern Cable Treaty (조선북로전선조약,朝鮮北路電線條約) is signed by China and Korea. By this treaty, the telegraphic service from Seoul to [[Wonsan]] is in operation.
*1892: Issuance of the '''Baekdonghwa (백동화,白銅貨)''', with the enforcement of the New Currency Regulations (신식화폐조례,新式貨幣條例). Although it caused some chaos on which currency to use, it also stabilised the inflation within the peninsula.
*1893: March. The '''[[Korean Imperial Naval Academy]] (통제영학당,統制營學堂)''' is established. The academy produces approximately 160 officers before its close during and after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].
*1894: February. The outbreak of the '''[[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] (동학농민운동,東學農民運動)'''. The communication between the [[Donghak]] faction and King Gojong were smooth until Japanese intervention- which led to the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].

==Japanese interventions (1894–97)==
[[File:Kim Hong-Jip.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Kim Hong-jip (1842–96), prime minister of the Gabo Government]]
This phase does not show much development within the Korean Peninsula. It is a brief period of intense power struggle between Japan and Russia, competing to expand their influence in the peninsula.

*1894:  June. The [[Gabo Reform]] (갑오개혁,甲午改革) is initiated by Prime Minister [[Kim Hong-jip]] (김홍집,金弘集), Park Jung-yang (박정양,朴定陽),Kim Yun-sik (김윤식,金允植), Cho Hei-yeon (조희연,趙羲淵), Kim Ga-jin (김가진,金嘉鎭), An Gyung-su (안경수,安駉壽), Kim Hak-wu (김학우,金鶴羽) and Yu Gil-jun (유길준,兪吉濬). The heteronomous reform ends in February the next year. It was an attempt of Japan by using Japanophile Korean officials to change Korea into a system more like Japan, for an easier administration of Korea after its annexation.
[[Image:Young Philip Jaisohn.jpg|thumb|110px|left|[[Seo Jae-pil]], the founder of the [[Independence Club]].]]
*1895:  8 October. [[Empress Myeongseong]] (명성황후,明成皇后) is assassinated by Japanese agents under [[Miura Gorō|Miura Goro]](三浦梧樓). Japan gets much criticism from other modern countries about such barbaric methods, and therefore arrests Miura as a matter of formality. After spending some time in Hiroshima prison, however, he is released due to the "lack of evidence".
*1896:  11 February. '''King Gojong fled to the Russian legation in Seoul (아관파천,俄館播遷)'''.
*1896:  2 July. Establishment of the [[Independence Club]] by [[Seo Jae-pil]] (서재필,徐載弼). It is to be noted that Seo took part in the [[Gapsin Coup]] (갑신정변,甲申政變) in 1884. Some people related to the coup d’État were Kim Ok-gyun (김옥균,金玉均) and Park Yung-hyo (박영효,朴泳孝).

==Later modernizations  (1897–1905)==
Phase two of the Gwangmu Reform began with the proclamation of the [[Korean Empire]] on 4 October 1897. Efforts for modernisation were spurred with the coronation of Gojong as Emperor but were restrained by Japan after the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905. The main innovator in this phase is [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Emperor Gojong]].

*1897:  February. King Gojong established the [[Board of Marshals|Board of Marshals (원수부,元帥府)]]. All military power was henceforth centralized to the Emperor.
*1897:  20 February. King [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Gojong]] (고종,高宗) returned to the palace after 1 year of refuge at the Russian legation.
*1897:  September. The Donghwa Pharmacy opened in Seoul, Korea. The established corporation, now known as the Dong Wha Pharmacy Corporation., Limited (동화약품(주),同和藥品(株)). The company, now the oldest pharmacy-based corporation in Korea, has products that are nationally famous, with its 'folding fan' trademark.
*1897:  October. Gojong declares the '''[[Korean Empire]] (대한제국,大韓帝國)''' and became the Gwangmu Emperor, the first imperial head of state and hereditary sovereign of the Empire of Korea. Most historians view this as the official declaration of the Gwangmu Reform (광무개혁,光武改革). Soongsil Academy was founded in Pyongyang as a private school by Dr. [[William M. Baird]], a missionary of the Northern Presbyterian Church of America. The [[Soongsil University]] is its descendant.
*1897:  November. [[John McLeavy Brown]] constructed his lasting legacy upon the Korean Empire- the [[Tapgol Park|Pagoda Park]]. It is notable the [[March 1st Movement]], an important part in the [[Korean independence movement]] was initiated in this park.
*1898:  January. The Seoul Electric Corporation (한성전기회사,漢城電氣會社), or the Korea-American Electric Corporation (한미전기회사,韓美電氣會社) was opened as a [[Joint venture|joint-venture]] company between Americans Henry Collbran, H.R.Bostwick and Emperor Gojong. A public corporation it was responsible for the construction of the streetp lamps in Seoul, along with imports of numerous other electricity-related devices. The [[Korea Electric Power Corporation]] (한국전력공사,韓國電力公社) is its descendant.
*1898:  May. The '''Jong-hyun Catholic Church (종현본당,鐘峴本堂)''' was finished of construction. It was the first [[Gothic architecture]] to be built in Korea. It was later called the [[Myeongdong Cathedral]] (명동성당,明洞聖堂), the centre of the Korean 20th century. It is registered as a national historical landmark.
*1898:  August. Brown reported blueprint of the Pan-Korean railway to Gojong.
*1898:  September. Kim Hong-nyuk (김홍륙,金鴻陸) attempted assassination of Gojong by putting excess amount of [[opium]] in his coffee. It is to be noted that Gojong was a [[coffee]] lover. While Gojong spat out the coffee upon drinking it, his son [[Sunjong]] (순종,純宗) drank the opium-tainted coffee and suffered from mental and physical disabilities from the incident.
*1898:  September 5. The [[Hwangseong Sinmun|Imperial Capital Gazette]] released its first print. The president of the company was Nam Gung-euk (남궁억,南宮檍).
[[File:The West Gate of Seoul, Korean Empire (대한제국 서대문역).jpg|thumb|180px|right|The West Gate of Seoul]]
*1899:  January. Several Korean entrepreneurs and high-ranking officials, such as Sim Sang-hun (심상훈,沈相薰), Minister of Agriculture Min Byung-suk (민병석,閔丙奭), Field Marshal Min Yung-gi (민영기,閔泳綺), Vice-minister of Justice Yi Geun-ho (이근호,李根澔), Head of the Treasury (전환국장,典圜局長) Yi yong-ik (이용익,李容翊), Minister of National Defense (원수부군무국장,元帥府軍務局長) Jo dong-yun (조동윤,趙東潤), Song Mun-sup (송문섭,宋文燮), Jung yung-du (정영두,鄭永斗) and Kim gi-young (김기영,金基永) established the '''Daehan Chunil Bank (대한천일은행,大韓天一銀行)'''. The bank operated as both a local bank and [[central bank]]. The bank is the predecessor of the [[Woori Bank]].
*1899:  April. The Gwangjaewon (광제원,廣濟院), the first modern [[Public hospital|national hospital]], opened. It is the present-day [[Seoul National University Hospital]], which is one of the biggest hospital in South Korea and a forerunner in many fields of [[Healthcare science|medical sciences]].
*1899:  May. American businessmen Henry Collbran and H.R.Bostwick opened the first [[Tramway track|tram lines]] within Seoul (the West gate-East gate line).
*1899:  August. The promulgation of the '''Korean Imperial Legislation''' (대한제국국제,大韓帝國國制) by the Ministry of Justice (법규교정소,法規校正所). This is of certain significance, as it led to Gojong's success in modernisation of the empire. It also took international laws into consideration. Although the actual legislation is very short, numerous other edicts were proclaimed to be used like laws.
*1899:  September. The establishment of the Northwest Railway Bureau (서북철도국,西北鐵道局), an agency within the [[Gungnaebu]] (궁내부,宮內府). Its mission was to construct a railway from Seoul to [[Sinuiju]] (신의주,新義州) without the help from foreign countries. This department later became the [[Korail]], or the Korea Railroad Corporation (한국철도공사,韓國鐵道公社). 
*1900:  January. Korean Empire became a member of the [[Universal Postal Union]]. 
*1900:  April. '''Construction of [[streetlamp]]s on [[Jongno|Jong-ro]]''', Seoul. The Korean Empire opens its own exhibition pavilion in the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] of Paris.
[[File:Hospital during the Korean Empire.jpg|thumb|220px|right|The Dae-han National hospital, the first national hospital opened in Korea]]
*1900:  July. Seoul-[[Incheon]] railroad opened with completion of the Han River Bridge (한강철교,漢江鐵橋). The bridge later becomes part of the Hangang Railway Bridge. It is still in operation.
*1900:  October. The '''Hanseung Secondary School (한성중학교,漢城中學校)''' was finished construction. It is the predecessor of [[Kyunggi High School]] (경기고등학교,京畿高等學校), one of the best high schools in Korea.
*1901:  February. Proclamation of ordinances for the new currency (adoption of the [[Gold Standard]]). [[Franz Eckert]] arrived to Seoul for establishment of the Korean Imperial Marching Band. He composed the [[Korean Empire Aegukga|Korean Imperial National Anthem]]. It is to be noted he also composed the [[Kimigayo]], the Japanese counterpart.
*1901:  March. The [[Belgium–Korea Treaty of 1901]] (조백수호통상조약,朝白修好通商條約) is signed by Jae-sun Park (박제순,朴齊純), delegate of the Korean Empire and Leon Vincart, the Belgian counterpart. It is notable the treaty was not terminated, unlike many others after the Korea-Japanese 1905 Treaty.
*1901:  October. Inauguration of the '''Jigye Ahmun (지계아문,地契衙門)''', a system to issue legal documents of property ownership (지계,地契). It marks the start of a modern [[cadastral]] survey project.
[[File:Chongno1905.jpg|thumb|220px|left|The modernisation of Seoul and its effects.]]
*1902:  March. Embarkment of construction upon the Seoul-[[Gaesung]] line, Dispatch of government officials with jurisdiction over [[Jiandao|Gando]] (간도,間島)

*1903:  January. The Korean Empire became member of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].
*1903:  February. Establishment of the Hanseung Bank (한성은행,漢城銀行). It is the present-day [[Shinhan Bank]] (신한은행,新韓銀行), one of the most prominent banks in Korea.
*1903:  April. The [[Mitsui Corporation]] (三井グループ) sold a battleship to the Korean Empire for 250,000 [[Korean won|Won]]. The ship, which was a reconstructed cargo ship for military usage, was a slapdash product by the Japanese and was extremely inefficient. The battleship was christened '''"[[KIS Yangmu|KIS ''Yangmu'']]" (양무호,楊武號)''', which means 'Growing the strength of a Nation'.
*1903:  December. Collbran and Bostwick started construction of the Ttuk Island [[Reservoir|freshwater reservoir]]. The reservoir is still being used as the Ttuk Island [[Drainage basin]] 1 reservoir (뚝도수원지제1정수장,--水源地第一淨水場).
*1904:  March. The first [[weather station|meteorological observatories]] were constructed in [[Mokpo]] and various other places. 
*1904:  July. The establishment of the ''Korean Daily News'' (대한매일신보,大韓每日申報). It is now the ''[[Seoul Shinmun]]'', the oldest newspaper still operating in Korea.
*1904:  September. Jejungwon hospital in Seoul, was renamed [[Severance Hospital]], added Severance Hospital Medical School and the attached School of Nursing. 
[[File:KIS Guangmu.png|thumb|220px|left|The Korean imperial battleship, [[KIS Guangjae|KIS ''Guangjae'']]]]
*1904:  November. The [[Pre-dreadnought battleship]] '''[[KIS Guangjae|KIS ''Guangjae'']] (광제호,光濟號)''' started operation in Incheon, Korea. It had a displacement of 1,056 tonnes. Its full speed was 14.77 knots with 2483 horsepower. The engine was a [[triple-expansion steam engine]].The battleship and was made by [[Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation]] (川崎造船) and was given the mission for patrolling the Western Korean maritime territory. It is also the first Korean battleship to be equipped with the [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless telegraph]].
*1905:  June. the [[Taft–Katsura Agreement]]- America recognized Korea as Japanese territory and Japanese recognized Philippines as American territory.
[[File:Japanese soldiers near Chemulpo Korea August September 1904 Russo Japanese War.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Japanese soldiers near Incheon, Korea during the [[Russo-Japanese War]].]]
*1905:  May. Yi Yong-ik (이용익,李容翊), Secretary of the Imperial Treasury, established '''Bosung College (보성학교,普成學校)''', later to be known as the [[Korea University]] (고려대학교,高麗大學校).
*1905:  June. 30 merchants establish the Hanseung Chamber of Commerce (한성상무회의소,漢城商務會議所), the first of its kind in Korea. The first president of the association was Kim gi-yeung (김기영,金基永). They also operated the Commerce Monthly (상공월보,商工月報), which was the first [[Business journalism|business journal]].
*1905:  November. Japan declared Korea a protectorate after success at the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Japan forced Korea to sign the [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905|Eulsa Treaty]] (을사조약,乙巳條約), for formalisation of its sphere of influence around the Korean Peninsula.

==Japanese interventions and annexation of Korea (1905–10)==
This was the darkest period of the Gwangmu Reform, ending with the annexation of Korea by Japan on the 29th of August, 1910.

[[File:Hague Secret Emissary Affair.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Hague Secret Emissary.]]
*1906:  January. Yi Yong-ik, former Secretary of the Imperial Treasury, is assassinated in [[Vladivostok]], Russia.
*1907:  June. The '''[[Hague Secret Emissary Affair]] (헤이그 특사 사건,海牙特使事件)''' was initiated by Emperor [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Gojong]] and carried by Sang-sul Yi (이상설,李相卨), [[Yi Tjoune|Jun Yi]](이준,李儁), [[Yi Wi-jong|Wi-jong Yi]] (이위종,李瑋鍾) and [[Homer Hulbert]]. Gojong initiated this by a confidential invitation from the former Russian Tsar, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. While Hulbert lured the Japanese spies into the wrong path, the three Koreans went to the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague conference]]. However, they were blocked by the Japanese for the reasons that they were not nation-states even though they were on the list of invitation. Undaunted, they sought for interest of the press and found hope. Two notable figures they gained attention of are [[Bertha von Suttner]] and [[William Thomas Stead]].
[[File:An Jung-geun.JPG|thumb|130px|right|An Jung-geun, [[lieutenant general|Lieutenant-general]] of the Korean Imperial Army.]]
*1907:  July 18. Gojong was forced to abdicate in favour of his son, Sunjong.
*1907:  July 24. The [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1907]] (한일신협약,韓日新協約) is enforced by Japan. It states that the Korean Empire would act under guidance of the Japanese Resident-General, and have also lost its diplomatic rights as a [[protectorate]]. 
*1908:  March. [[Durham Stevens]], a former employee of Japan's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], is assassinated by [[Jang In-hwan]] (장인환,張仁煥) and [[Jeon Myeong-un]] (전명운,田明雲) in [[San Francisco]] for his active participation and support upon the Japanese presence coming into the Korean government.
*1909:  September. [[Jiandao|Gando]] is reclaimed by China after the [[Gando Convention|Sino-Japanese convention over Gando]] (간도협약,間島協約).
*1909:  October. '''Ito Hirobumi (the first Resident-General) is assassinated by Korean Lieutenant-General [[An Jung-geun]] (안중근,安重根)'''. This incident was dramatized in the recent Korean musical, Hero (영웅,英雄). The musical premiered in [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] on August 23, 2011.
*1910:  August. The [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910]] started the annexation of the Korean Empire by Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19477">The '''upper class''' in modern societies is the [[social class]] composed of people who hold the highest social status, and usually are also the [[economic inequality|wealthiest]] members of society, and also wield the greatest [[political power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/04/08/rich-people-rule/|title=Rich people rule!|first=Larry|last=Bartels|date=8 April 2014|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, the upper class is generally distinguished by immense wealth which is passed on from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Akhbar-Williams |first=Tahira |authorlink=Tahira Akhbar-Williams |chapter=Class Structure|editor=Smith, Jessie C.|title=Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture, Volume 1|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-313-35796-1 |page=322|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10rEGSIItjgC&amp;pg=PA322}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 20th century, the emphasis was on "[[aristocracy]]", which emphasized  generations of inherited noble status, not just recent wealth. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Rothenberg |editor1-first=Paula S. |author1=[[Gregory Mantsios]] |chapter=Class in America – 2009 |title=Race, class, and gender in the United States: an integrated study |date=2010 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4292-1788-0 |page=179 |edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the upper classes of a society may no longer rule the society in which they are living, they are often referred to as the old upper classes and they are often culturally distinct from the newly rich middle classes that tend to dominate public life  in modern social democracies.{{cn|date=July 2016}} According to the latter view held by the traditional upper classes, no amount of individual wealth or fame would make a person from an undistinguished background into a member of the upper class as one must be born into a family of that class and raised in a particular manner  so as to understand and share upper class values, traditions, and cultural norms.
The term is often used in conjunction with terms like "[[upper-middle class]]", "[[middle class]]", and "[[working class]]" as part of a model of [[social stratification]].

==Historical meaning==

Historically in some cultures, members of an upper class often did not have to work for a living, as they were supported by earned or inherited investments (often [[real estate]]), although members of the upper class may have had less actual money than merchants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-1257,00.html |title=How should we define working class, middle class and upper class? |year=2011 |access-date=15 September 2018 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian News and Media Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upper-class status commonly derived from the social position of one's family and not from one's own achievements or wealth. Much of the population that composed the upper class consisted of aristocrats, ruling families, titled people, and [[ecclesiastical polity|religious hierarchs]]. These people were usually born into their status and historically there was not much movement across class boundaries.
[[File:Baile del Santiago antiguo.jpg|thumb|left|Ball in [[Captaincy General of Chile|colonial Chile]] by [[Pedro Subercaseaux]]. In [[Spanish Empire|Spain's American colonies]], the upper classes were made up of Europeans and [[Criollo people|American born Spaniards]] and were heavily influenced by European trends.]]  
In many countries, the term "upper class" was intimately associated with hereditary land ownership. Political power was often in the hands of the landowners in many [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]] despite there being no legal barriers to land ownership for other social classes. Upper-class landowners in Europe were often also members of the titled [[nobility]], though not necessarily: the prevalence of titles of nobility varied widely from country to country. Some upper classes were almost entirely untitled, for example, the [[Szlachta]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[File:Harrods 1909.jpg|thumb|The upmarket [[Harrods]] department store in London, 1909]]
In [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Ireland]], the "upper class" traditionally comprised the [[landed gentry]] and the [[aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] of noble families with hereditary titles. The vast majority of post-medieval aristocratic families originated in the merchant class and were ennobled between the 14th and 19th centuries while intermarrying with the old nobility and gentry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Arnold | last = Toynbee | authorlink = Arnold Toynbee | title = Study of History: Abridgement of Vols I-X in one volume | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Second World War, the term has come to encompass rich and powerful members of the managerial and professional classes as well.&lt;ref name=Krummel2008 /&gt;

==United States==
{{Main article|American upper class}}
[[File:Age of Innocence (1st ed dust jacket).jpg|thumb|First edition dust cover of [[Edith Wharton]]'s 1920 [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novel ''[[The Age of Innocence]]'', a story set in upper-class [[New York City]] in the 1870s]]
In the [[United States]], the upper class, as distinguished from the rich, is often considered to consist of those families that have for many generations enjoyed top social status based on their leadership in society. In this respect, the US differs little from countries such as the UK where membership of the 'upper class' is also dependent on other factors. In the United Kingdom, it has been said that class is relative to where you have come from, similar to the United States where class is more defined by ''who'' as opposed to ''how much''; that is, in the UK and the US people are born into the upper class. The American upper class is estimated to constitute less than 1% of the population. By self-identification, according to this 2001–2012 Gallup Poll data, 98% of Americans identify with the 5 other class terms used, 48–50% identifying as "middle class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/159029/americans-likely-say-belong-middle-class.aspx | title=Americans Most Likely to Say They Belong to the Middle Class | date=30 November 2012 | first=Andrew | last=Dugan | authorlink= Andrew Dugan |publisher=Gallup | accessdate=10 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main distinguishing feature of the upper class is its ability to derive enormous [[Income in the United States|incomes]] from [[Wealth in the United States|wealth]] through techniques such as money management and investing, rather than engaging in wage-labor or salaried employment.&lt;ref name="The American Class Structure"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gilbert | first = Dennis | year = 1998 | title = The American Class Structure | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing | location = New York | isbn = 0-534-50520-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"&gt;{{cite book | last = Thompson | first = William | authorlink= William Thompson (sociologist) | first2 = Joseph | last2 = Hickey | authorlink2= Joseph Hickey | year = 2005 | title = Society in Focus | publisher = Pearson | location = Boston, Mass. | isbn = 0-205-41365-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marriages, Families &amp; Intimate Relationships"&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Brian | authorlink=Brian Williams | first2 = Stacey C. | last2 = Sawyer | authorlink2= Stacey C.

An [[A-list]] actor, for example, might not be accorded as much prestige as a former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]],&lt;ref name="Society in Focus"/&gt; yet all members of this class are so influential and wealthy as to be considered members of the upper class.&lt;ref name="The American Class Structure"/&gt; At the pinnacle of U.S  wealth, 2004 saw a dramatic increase in the numbers of billionaires. According to ''[[Forbes Magazine]]'', there are now 374 U.S. billionaires. The growth in billionaires took a dramatic leap since the early 1980s, when the average net worth of the individuals on the Forbes 400 list was $400 million. Today, the average net worth is $2.8 billion. Wal-Mart Walton family now has 771,287 times more than the median U.S household (Collins and Yeskel 322).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/spi/2014/pdf/spi0314.pdf|title= State Personal Income 2013| publisher=U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis |date=March 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the book ''[[Who Rules America?]]'' by [[William Domhoff]], the distribution of wealth in America is the primary highlight of the influence of the upper class. The top 1% of Americans own around 34% of the wealth in the U.S. while the bottom 80% own only approximately 16% of the wealth. This large disparity displays the unequal distribution of wealth in America in absolute terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Domhoff |first= G.

'''Virtue ethics''' (or '''aretaic ethics'''&lt;ref&gt;David Carr, Jan Steutel (eds.), ''Virtue Ethics and Moral Education'', Routledge, 1999, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ær|ə|ˈ|t|eɪ|.|ɪ|k}}, from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ἀρετή|ἀρετή]] (''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'')) are [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] theories which emphasize [[virtues]] of mind and character. Virtue ethicists discuss the nature and definition of [[virtues]] and other related problems. These include how virtues are acquired, how they are applied in various real life contexts, and whether they are rooted in a universal human nature or in a plurality of cultures.

== Key concepts ==
The western tradition's key concepts derive from [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. These theories include ''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'' (excellence or virtue), ''[[phronesis]]'' (practical or moral wisdom), and ''[[eudaimonia]]'' (flourishing).

A virtue is generally agreed to be a character trait, such as a habitual action or settled sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2013/entries/ethics-virtue/|title=Virtue Ethics|last=Hursthouse|first=Rosalind|date=2013-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, a virtue is a positive trait that makes its possessor a good human being. A virtue is thus to be distinguished from single actions or feelings. [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] says:  &lt;blockquote&gt;A virtue such as honesty or generosity is not just a tendency to do what is honest or generous, nor is it to be helpfully specified as a “desirable” or “morally valuable” character trait. It is, indeed a character trait—that is, a disposition which is well entrenched in its possessor, something that, as we say “goes all the way down”, unlike a habit such as being a tea-drinker—but the disposition in question, far from being a single track disposition to do honest actions, or even honest actions for certain reasons, is multi-track. It is concerned with many other actions as well, with emotions and emotional reactions, choices, values, desires, perceptions, attitudes, interests, expectations and sensibilities. To possess a virtue is to be a certain sort of person with a certain complex mindset. (Hence the extreme recklessness of attributing a virtue on the basis of a single action.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Practical wisdom is an acquired trait that enables its possessor to identify the thing to do in any given situation.&lt;ref&gt;Pincoffs, Edmund (1971). Quandary ethics. _Mind_ 80 (320):552-571.
&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike theoretical wisdom, practical reason results in action or decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/aristotle-ethics/|title=Aristotle's Ethics|last=Kraut|first=Richard|date=2016-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As John McDowell puts it, practical wisdom involves a "perceptual sensitivity" to what a situation requires.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, John. "Virtue and Reason". _The Monist_. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Eudaimonia]]'' (εὐδαιμονία) is a state variously translated from Greek as 'well-being', 'happiness', 'blessedness', and in the context of virtue ethics, 'human flourishing'.&lt;ref&gt;Pojman, L.P. &amp; Fieser, J. (2009). Virtue Theory. In ''Ethics: Discovering Right and Wrong'' (pp. 146-169). (6th ed.)  Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eudaimonia'' in this sense is not a subjective, but an objective, state. It characterizes the well-lived life. According to Aristotle, the most prominent exponent of ''eudaimonia'' in the Western philosophical tradition, "eudaimonia" is the proper goal of human life. It consists of exercising the characteristic human quality—[[reason]]—as the soul's most proper and nourishing activity. In his ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Aristotle, like Plato before him, argued that the pursuit of ''eudaimonia'' is an "activity of the soul in accordance with perfect virtue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|title=Nicomachean Ethics|pages=Book I}}&lt;/ref&gt; which further could only properly be exercised in the characteristic human community—the ''[[polis]]'' or [[city-state]].

Although ''eudaimonia'' was first popularized by Aristotle, it now belongs to the tradition of virtue theories generally. For the virtue theorist, ''eudaimonia'' describes that state achieved by the person who lives the proper human life, an outcome that can be reached by practicing the virtues.  A virtue is a habit or quality that allows the bearer to succeed at his, her, or its purpose. The virtue of a knife, for example, is sharpness; among the virtues of a racehorse is speed. Thus, to identify the virtues for human beings, one must have an account of what the human purpose is.

==History of virtue==
{{Catholic philosophy |expanded=all}}
Like much of the Western tradition, virtue theory seems to have originated in ancient [[Greek Philosophy|Greek philosophy]].

Virtue ethics began with [[Socrates]], and was subsequently developed further by [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Stoics]].&lt;ref&gt;P Gardiner - [http://jme.bmj.com/content/29/5/297 A virtue ethics approach to moral dilemmas in medicine] Journal of Medical Ethics / Volume 29, Issue 5 https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jme.29.5.297 Accessed November 24th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Bowin -  [https://people.ucsc.edu/~jbowin/virtue.pdf Aristotle's Virtue Ethics] [[University of California, Santa Cruz |University of Santa Cruz (California)]] Accessed November 24th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Chappell (2010) - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IiXfj1PCr9YC&amp;pg Plato: Oxford Bibliographies Online Research Guide] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IiXfj1PCr9YC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Virtue+ethics+began+with+Socrates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWwdOl6dfXAhVK1xoKHfxgBnYQ6AEIPzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Virtue%20ethics%20began%20with%20Socrates&amp;f=false p.10] {{ISBN|019980902X}}  Accessed November 24th, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue ethics refers to a collection of [[normative]] ethical philosophies that place an emphasis on being rather than doing.  Another way to say this is that in virtue ethics, morality stems from the identity or character of the individual, rather than being a reflection of the actions (or consequences thereof) of the individual.  Today, there is debate among various adherents of virtue ethics concerning what specific virtues are morally praiseworthy.  However, most theorists agree that morality comes as a result of intrinsic virtues. Intrinsic virtues are the common link that unites the disparate normative philosophies into the field known as virtue ethics. Plato and Aristotle's treatment of virtues are not the same. Plato believes virtue is effectively an end to be sought, for which a friend might be a useful means. Aristotle states that the virtues function more as means to safeguard human relations, particularly authentic friendship, without which one's quest for happiness is frustrated.

Discussion of what were known as the [[Four Cardinal Virtues]] – [[wisdom]], [[justice]], [[Cardinal virtues|fortitude]], and [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] – can be found in Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. The virtues also figure prominently in Aristotle's moral theory (see below). Virtue theory was inserted into the study of [[history]] by moralistic historians such as [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Tacitus]].  The Greek idea of the virtues was passed on in Roman philosophy through [[Cicero]] and later incorporated into [[Christian]] moral theology by [[St. Ambrose]] of Milan. During the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] period, the most comprehensive consideration of the virtues from a theological perspective was provided by St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' and his ''Commentaries on the [[Nicomachean Ethics]]''.

Though the tradition receded into the background of European philosophical thought in these centuries, the term "virtue" remained current during this period, and in fact appears prominently in the tradition of [[classical republicanism]] or [[classical liberalism]]. This tradition was prominent in the intellectual life of 16th-century [[Italy]], as well as 17th- and 18th-century Britain and America; indeed the term "virtue" appears frequently in the work of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[David Hume]], the republicans of the [[English Civil War]] period, the 18th-century English [[British Whig Party|Whigs]], and the prominent figures among the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and the [[Founding Fathers|American Founding Fathers]].

===Contemporary "aretaic turn"&lt;!--"Aretaic turn" redirects here--&gt;===
Although some [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers (e.g. [[David Hume|Hume]]) continued to emphasise the virtues, with the ascendancy of [[utilitarianism]] and [[deontology]], virtue theory moved to the margins of Western philosophy. The contemporary revival of virtue theory is frequently traced to the philosopher [[G. E. M. Anscombe]]'s 1958 essay "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]". Following this:
* In the 1976 paper "[[The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories]]", Michael Stocker summarises the main aretaic criticisms of deontological and consequentialist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stocker | first1 = Michael | year = 1976 | title = The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories | url = | journal = The Journal of Philosophy | volume = 73 | issue = 14| pages = 453–466 | doi = 10.2307/2025782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Philippa Foot]], who published a collection of essays in 1978 entitled ''Virtues and Vices.''
* [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] has made an effort to reconstruct a virtue-based theory in dialogue with the problems of modern and [[postmodernism|postmodern]] thought; his works include ''[[After Virtue]]'' and ''Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry''.
* [[Paul Ricoeur]] has accorded an important place to Aristotelian [[teleological ethics]] in his [[hermeneutical]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of the subject, most notably in his book ''Oneself as Another''.
* Theologian [[Stanley Hauerwas]] has also found the language of virtue quite helpful in his own project.
* [[Rosalind Hursthouse]] has published ''On Virtue Ethics''.
* [[Roger Crisp]] and [[Michael Slote]] have edited a collection of important essays titled ''Virtue Ethics''.
* [[Martha Nussbaum]] and [[Amartya Sen]] have employed virtue theory in theorising the [[capability approach]] to [[international development]].
* [[Julia Annas]] wrote ''The Morality of Happiness'' (1993).
* [[Lawrence C. Becker]] identified current virtue theory with [[Stoicism]] (or [[Modern Stoicism]]) in ''A New Stoicism.'' (1998).

The '''aretaic turn'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in moral philosophy is paralleled by analogous developments in other philosophical disciplines. One of these is [[epistemology]], where a distinctive [[virtue epistemology]] has been developed by [[Linda Trinkaus Zagzebski|Linda Zagzebski]] and others. In political theory, there has been discussion of "virtue politics", and in legal theory, there is a small but growing body of literature on [[virtue jurisprudence]]. The aretaic turn also exists in [[United States of America|American]] [[constitutional theory]], where proponents argue for an emphasis on virtue and vice of constitutional [[adjudicator]]s.

Aretaic approaches to morality, epistemology, and jurisprudence have been the subject of intense debates. One criticism that is frequently made focuses on the problem of guidance; opponents, such as Robert Louden in his article "Some Vices of Virtue Ethics", question whether the idea of a virtuous moral actor, believer, or judge can provide the guidance necessary for action, belief formation, or the decision of legal disputes.

== Lists of virtues ==
There are several different lists of particular virtues. Socrates argued that virtue is knowledge, which suggests that there is really only one virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Meno.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics concurred, claiming the four cardinal virtues were only aspects of true virtue. John McDowell is a recent defender of this conception. He argues that virtue is a "perceptual capacity" to identify how one ought to act, and that all particular virtues are merely "specialized sensitivities" to a range of reasons for acting.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, John. "Virtue and reason." ''The monist'' 62.3 (1979): 331-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Aristotle's list

Aristotle identifies approximately eighteen virtues that enable a person to perform their human function well.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nicomachean Ethics.''&lt;/ref&gt;  He distinguished virtues pertaining to emotion and desire from those pertaining to the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Nicomachean Ethics, Book II.&lt;/ref&gt; The first he calls "moral" virtues, and the second intellectual virtues (though both are "moral" in the modern sense of the word).  Each moral virtue was a mean (see [[Golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]]) between two corresponding vices, one of excess and one of deficiency. Each intellectual virtue is a mental skill or habit by which the mind arrives at truth, affirming what is or denying what is not.&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'' Book VI&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' he discusses about 11 moral virtues:

;Moral Virtues

1. '''Courage''' in the face of fear

2. '''Temperance''' in the face of pleasure and pain

3. '''Liberality''' with wealth and possessions

4. '''Magnificence''' with great wealth and possessions

5. '''Magnanimity''' with great honors

6. '''Proper ambition''' with normal honors

7. '''Truthfulness''' with self-expression

8. '''Wittiness''' in conversation

9. '''Friendliness''' in social conduct

10. '''Modesty''' in the face of shame or shamelessness

11. '''Righteous indignation''' in the face of injury

;Intellectual virtues
# [[Nous]] (intelligence), which apprehends fundamental truths (such as definitions, self-evident principles)
# [[Episteme]] (science), which is skill with inferential reasoning (such as proofs, syllogisms, demonstrations)
# Sophia (theoretical wisdom), which combines fundamental truths with valid, necessary inferences to reason well about unchanging truths.
Aristotle also mentions several other traits: 
* Gnome (good sense) -- passing judgment, "sympathetic understanding" 
* Synesis (understanding) -- comprehending what others say, does not issue commands
* [[Phronesis]] (practical wisdom) -- knowledge of what to do, knowledge of changing truths, issues commands
* Techne (art, craftsmanship)
Aristotle's list is not the only list, however. As [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] observed in ''[[After Virtue]]'',  thinkers as diverse as: [[Homer]]; the authors of the [[New Testament]]; [[Thomas Aquinas]]; and [[Benjamin Franklin]]; have all proposed lists.&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre, ''After Virtue'', chp 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Some philosophers criticise virtue ethics as [[culturally relative]]. Since different people, cultures and societies often have different opinions on what constitutes a virtue, perhaps there is no one objectively right list.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

For example, regarding what are the most important virtues, Aristotle proposed the following nine: wisdom; prudence; justice; fortitude; courage; liberality; magnificence; magnanimity; temperance.  In contrast, one modern-era philosopher proposed as the four cardinal virtues:  ambition/humility;  love;  courage;  and honesty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Kaufmann, W.]], 1961. The Faith Of A Heretic. Doubleday &amp; Co., pages 317-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

As another example, regarding virtues once supposedly applicable to women, many would have once considered a virtuous woman to be quiet, servile, and industrious. This conception of female virtue no longer holds true in many modern societies. Proponents of virtue theory sometimes respond to this objection by arguing that a central feature of a virtue is its ''universal applicability''. In other words, any character trait defined as a virtue must reasonably be universally regarded as a virtue for all sentient beings. According to this view, it is inconsistent to claim for example servility as a female virtue, while at the same time not proposing it as a male one.

Other proponents of virtue theory, notably [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], respond to this objection by arguing that any account of the virtues must indeed be generated out of the community in which those virtues are to be practiced: the very word ''ethics'' implies "[[ethos]]". That is to say that the virtues are, and necessarily must be, grounded in a particular time and place. What counts as virtue in 4th-century Athens would be a ludicrous guide to proper behavior in 21st-century Toronto, and vice versa. To take this view does not necessarily commit one to the argument that accounts of the virtues must therefore be static: moral activity—that is, attempts to contemplate and practice the virtues—can provide the cultural resources that allow people to change, albeit slowly, the ethos of their own societies. [[Alasdair MacIntyre|MacIntyre]] appears to take this position in his seminal work on virtue ethics, ''[[After Virtue]]''. One might cite (though [[Alasdair MacIntyre|MacIntyre]] does not) the rapid emergence of [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] thought in the [[slave]]-holding societies of the 18th-century [[Atlantic world]] as an example of this sort of change: over a relatively short period of time, perhaps 1760 to 1800, in Britain, France, and British America, slave-holding, previously thought to be morally neutral or even virtuous, rapidly became seen as vicious among wide swathes of society. While the emergence of abolitionist thought derived from many sources, the work of [[David Brion Davis]], among others,{{who|date=January 2011}} has established that one source was the rapid, internal evolution of moral theory among certain sectors of these societies, notably the [[Quakers]].

Another objection to virtue theory is that the school does not focus on what ''sorts of actions'' are morally permitted and which ones are not, but rather on what sort of qualities someone ought to foster in order to become a good person. In other words, while some virtue theorists may not condemn, for example, murder as an inherently immoral or impermissible sort of action, they may argue that someone who commits a murder is severely lacking in several important virtues, such as [[compassion]] and [[wikt:fairness|fairness]]. Still, antagonists of the theory often object that this particular feature of the theory makes virtue ethics useless as a universal norm of acceptable conduct suitable as a base for [[legislation]]. Some virtue theorists concede this point, but respond by opposing the very notion of legitimate legislative [[authority]] instead, effectively advocating some form of [[anarchism]] as the political ideal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Others argue that laws should be made by virtuous legislators. Still others argue that it is possible to base a judicial system on the moral notion of virtues rather than rules.

Some virtue theorists might respond to this overall objection with the notion of a "bad act" also being an act characteristic of [[vice]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} That is to say that those acts that do not aim at virtue, or stray from virtue, would constitute our conception of "bad behavior". Although not all virtue ethicists agree to this notion, this is one way the virtue ethicist can re-introduce the concept of the "morally impermissible".  One could raise objection with Foot that she is committing an [[argument from ignorance]] by postulating that what is not virtuous is unvirtuous.  In other words, just because an action or person 'lacks of evidence' for virtue does not, [[ceteris paribus|all else constant]], imply that said action or person is unvirtuous.

=== Subsumed in deontology and utilitarianism ===

[[Martha Nussbaum]] has suggested that while virtue ethics is often considered to be anti-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], "suspicious of theory and respectful of the wisdom embodied in local practices",&lt;ref name="Nussbaum" /&gt; it is actually neither fundamentally distinct from, nor does it qualify as a rival approach to deontology and utilitarianism. She argues that philosophers from these two Enlightenment traditions often include theories of virtue. She pointed out that [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] "Doctrine of Virtue" (in ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'') "covers most of the same topics as do classical Greek theories", "that he offers a general account of virtue, in terms of the strength of the will in overcoming wayward and selfish inclinations; that he offers detailed analyses of standard virtues such as courage and self-control, and of vices, such as avarice, mendacity, servility, and pride; that, although in general he portrays inclination as inimical to virtue, he also recognizes that sympathetic inclinations offer crucial support to virtue, and urges their deliberate cultivation."&lt;ref name="Nussbaum"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha C.|title=Virtue Ethics: A Misleading Category?|journal=The Journal of Ethics|year=1999|volume=3|issue=3|pages=163–201|jstor=25115613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nussbaum also points to considerations of virtue by utilitarians such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] (''[[The Methods of Ethics]]''), [[Jeremy Bentham]] (''[[The Principles of Morals and Legislation]]''), and [[John Stuart Mill]], who writes of moral development as part of an argument for the moral equality of women (''[[The Subjection of Women]]''). She argues that contemporary virtue ethicists such as [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[Bernard Williams]], [[Philippa Foot]], and [[John McDowell]] have few points of agreement, and that the common core of their work does not represent a break from Kant.

=== Utopianism and pluralism ===

[[Robert Louden]] criticises virtue ethics on the basis that it promotes a form of unsustainable [[utopianism]]. Trying to come to ''a'' single set of virtues is immensely difficult in contemporary societies as, according to Louden, they contain "more ethnic, religious, and class groups than did the moral community which Aristotle theorized about" with each of these groups having "not only its own interests but its own set of virtues as well". Louden notes in passing that MacIntyre, a supporter of virtue-based ethics, has grappled with this in ''[[After Virtue]]'' but that ethics cannot dispense with building rules around acts and rely only on discussing the moral character of persons.&lt;ref name="Louden"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Louden|first=Robert B.|title=On Some Vices of Virtue Ethics|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|date=July 1984|volume=21|issue=3|pages=227–236|jstor=20014051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics in virtue ethics ==

=== Virtue ethics as a category ===
Virtue ethics can be contrasted to [[deontological]] ethics and [[consequentialist]] ethics by an examination of the other two (the three being together the most predominant contemporary normative ethical theories).

[[Deontological ethics]], sometimes referred to as duty ethics, places the emphasis on adhering to ethical principles or duties.  How these duties are defined, however, is often a point of contention and debate in deontological ethics.  One of the predominant rule schemes utilized by deontologists is the [[Divine Command Theory]]. Deontology also depends upon meta-ethical [[Philosophical realism|realism]], in that it postulates the existence of [[moral absolute]]s that make an action moral, regardless of circumstances.  For more information on deontological ethics refer to the work of [[Immanuel Kant]].

The next predominant school of thought in normative ethics is [[consequentialism]].  While deontology places the emphasis on doing one's duty, which is established by some kind of moral imperative (in other words, the emphasis is on obedience to some higher moral absolute), consequentialism bases the morality of an action upon the consequences of the outcome.  Instead of saying that one has a moral duty to abstain from murder, a consequentialist would say that we should abstain from murder because it causes undesirable effects.  The main contention here is what outcomes should/can be identified as objectively desirable.  The [[Greatest Happiness Principle]] of [[John Stuart Mill]] is one of the most commonly adopted criteria.  Mill asserts that our determinant of the desirability of an action is the net amount of happiness it brings, the number of people it brings it to, and the duration of the happiness.  He also tries to delineate classes of happiness, some being preferable to others, but there is a great deal of difficulty in classifying such concepts.  
{{see|Utilitarianism|Utilitarianism (book)|On Liberty}}
Virtue ethics differs from both deontology consequentialism as it focuses on being over doing. A virtue ethicist identifies [[virtues]], desirable characteristics, that the moral or virtuous person embodies.  Possessing these virtues is what makes one moral, and one's actions are a mere reflection of one's inner morality.  To the virtue philosopher, action cannot be used as a demarcation of morality, because a virtue encompasses more than just a simple selection of action.  Instead, it is about a way of being that would cause the person exhibiting the virtue to make a certain "virtuous" choice consistently in each situation.  There is a great deal of disagreement within virtue ethics over what are virtues and what are not.  There are also difficulties in identifying what is the "virtuous" action to take in all circumstances, and how to define a virtue.

Consequentialist and deontological theories often still employ the term 'virtue', but in a restricted sense, namely as a tendency or disposition to adhere to the system's principles or rules.  These very different senses of what constitutes virtue, hidden behind the same word, are a potential source of confusion.  This disagreement over the meaning of virtue points to a larger conflict between virtue theory and its philosophical rivals.  A system of virtue theory is only intelligible if it is [[teleological]]: that is, if it includes an account of the purpose (''telos'') of human life, or in popular language, the [[meaning of life]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Obviously, strong claims about the purpose of human life, or of what the good life for human beings is, will be highly controversial.  Virtue theory's necessary commitment to a teleological account of human life thus puts the tradition in sharp tension with other dominant approaches to normative ethics, which, because they focus on actions, do not bear this burden.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Virtue ethics mainly deals with the honesty and morality of a person. It states that practicing good habits such as honesty, generosity makes a moral and virtuous person. It guides a person without specific rules for resolving the ethical complexity.

=== Virtue and politics ===
Virtue theory emphasises [[Aristotle]]'s belief in the [[polis]] as the acme of political organisation, and the role of the virtues in enabling human beings to flourish in that environment. Classical republicanism in contrast emphasises [[Tacitus]]' concern that power and luxury can corrupt individuals and destroy liberty, as Tacitus perceived in the transformation of the [[Roman Republic]] into the [[Roman Empire]]; virtue for classical republicans is a shield against this sort of corruption and a means to preserve the good life one has, rather than a means by which to achieve the good life one does not yet have. Another way to put the distinction between the two traditions is that virtue ethics relies on Aristotle's fundamental distinction between the human-being-as-he-is from the human-being-as-he-should-be, while classical republicanism relies on the Tacitean distinction of the human-being-as-he-is from the human-being-as-he-is-at-risk-of-becoming.&lt;ref&gt;J.G.A. Pocock, The Machiavellian Moment&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applied virtue ethics ===
Virtue ethics has a number of contemporary applications.

;Social and political philosophy
Within the field of social ethics, [[Deirdre McCloskey]] argues that virtue ethics can provide a basis for a balanced approach to understanding capitalism and capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, D.

{{Jain philosophy}}
'''Vitalism''' is at the core of [[Jain philosophy]] which separates ''[[Jiva]]'' (soul or life) from ''[[Ajiva]]'' (non-soul). According to Jain cosmology, whole universe is made up of six simple substances and is therefore eternal. These six substances ([[Dravya (Jainism)|dravya]]) are:-
*[[Jiva]]
*[[Time]]
*[[Space]]
*[[Dharma (Jainism)|Dharma]] (medium of motion)
*[[Adharma]]
*[[Matter]] ([[Pudgala]])

''Jiva'' or soul is distinguished from the rest five (termed ''[[Ajiva]]'') on account of the quality of intelligence with which it is endowed and of which the other substances are devoid.

== Overview ==
[[File:Jiva.jpg|thumb|Classification of ''Saṃsāri Jīvas'' (Transmigrating Souls) in Jainism.According to Sacred Jain text, ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]'': "Immobile beings (''sthāvara jīvās'') possess the four vitalities of the sense-organ of touch, strength of body or energy, respiration and life-duration.{{sfn|Jain|1960|p=62-63}}]]

According to [[Jainism]], there are ten [[vitalities]] or life-principles:-

*The five senses
**Touch
**Taste
**Smell
**Sight
**Hearing
*Energy,
*Respiration
*Life-duration
*The organ of speech
*The mind
The table below summarizes the vitalities that living beings possess in accordance with their senses.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=62–63,196}}

|}

According to major [[Jain text]], [[Tattvarthsutra]]: "The severance of vitalities out of passion is injury".

Because life is to be considered sacred and in every living thing, Jains avoid killing any living creature. They are not only [[vegetarian]], but decline to eat vegetables that grow under the ground because each underground stem contains infinite number of vitalities each of that can potentially grow into full-fledged plants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21002">The term '''white savior''', sometimes combined with [[savior complex]] to write '''white savior complex''', refers to a [[white people|white person]] who acts to help non-white people, with the help in some contexts perceived to be self-serving. The role is considered a modern-day version of what is expressed in the poem "[[The White Man's Burden]]" (1899) by [[Rudyard Kipling]].&lt;ref name="zane"&gt;{{cite news | last=Zane | first=Damian | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-36132482 | title=Barbie challenges the 'white saviour complex' | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=May 1, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been associated with Africa, and certain characters in film and television have been critiqued as white savior figures. Writer [[Teju Cole]] combined the term and "industrial complex" (derived from [[military-industrial complex]] and similarly applied elsewhere) to coin "White Savior Industrial Complex".

==Association with Africa==
{{see also|Aid}}
Africa has a [[slavery in Africa|history of slavery]] and [[Colonisation of Africa|of colonization]]. Damian Zane of [[BBC News]] said due to the history, Africans find the "white savior" attitude to help them "deeply patronising and offensive". Zane said, "Some argue that aid can be counter-productive, as it means African countries will continue to rely on outside help."&lt;ref name="zane" /&gt; Bhakti Shringarpure, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', said, "Westerners trying to help poor, suffering countries have often been accused of having a 'white saviour complex': a term tied up in colonial history where Europeans descended to 'civilise' the African continent."&lt;ref name="shringarpure"&gt;{{cite news | last=Shringarpure | first=Bhakti | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/digital-saviour-saving-lives-internet-age-save-darfur | title=The rise of the digital saviour: can Facebook likes change the world? | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=June 18, 2015 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s [[Karen Attiah]] said the white savior framework in Africa "follows the venerable tradition" of the novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899) by [[Joseph Conrad]] and that the tradition included the film ''[[Machine Gun Preacher]]'' (2011), the public relations campaign related to the documentary ''[[Kony 2012]]'' (2012), and the writings of journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]].&lt;ref name="attiah"&gt;{{cite news | last=Attiah | first=Karen | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/07/06/louise-linton-just-wrote-the-perfect-white-savior-in-africa-story/ | title=Louise Linton just wrote the perfect White-Savior-in-Africa story | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=July 6, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor and producer [[Louise Linton]] wrote a memoir about her [[gap year]] in [[Zambia]], ''In Congo's Shadow'', and wrote an article for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', "How my dream gap year in Africa turned into a nightmare", to promote the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Linton | first=Louise | authorlink=Louise Linton | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/how-my-dream-gap-year-in-africa-turned-into-a-nightmare/ | title=How my dream gap year in Africa turned into a nightmare | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701064204/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/how-my-dream-gap-year-in-africa-turned-into-a-nightmare/ | archivedate=July 1, 2016 | work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=July 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Schaub of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, "The reaction to Linton's article was swift and negative, accusing her of using clichés and misrepresentations... Several people have described Linton's memoir as a 'white savior' fantasy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Schaub | first=Michael | url=http://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-louise-linton-memoir-20160706-snap-htmlstory.html |title=Controversial Africa memoir draws fire for Louise Linton, actress, self-published author and Trump dining companion | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=July 6, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zambians and other Africans negatively criticized the article on [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Shearlaw | first=Maeve | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/05/zambians-hit-back-at-white-saviour-gap-yah-memoir | title=Briton's African gap year memoir sparks angry Twitter response | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=July 5, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attiah said the popular [[Instagram]] account "BarbieSavior" was inspired by the backlash to Linton's words.&lt;ref name="attiah" /&gt; [[Special Broadcasting Service]]'s Amal Awad said the Instagram account was parodied "a reckless trend" of [[voluntourism]] (volunteering and touring) in which "'white saviours' use the less fortunate like props in their social media profiles". Awad said the interest in volunteering encouraged a business model that leverages a country's existing social issues and charges tourists for volunteering to be a "saviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Awad | first=Amal | url=http://www.sbs.com.au/topics/life/culture/article/2016/04/28/when-saviour-becomes-story | title=When the saviour becomes the story | publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] | date=April 28, 2016 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baaz, Gondola, Marijnen, and Verweijen, writing in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', were critical of the "white savior complex" in the 2014 documentary ''[[Virunga (film)|Virunga]]'', which features the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]'s [[Virunga National Park]] and the conservation work of its [[park ranger]]s. They said, "The movie features endless footage of a park guard hugging and playing with the gorillas, evoking the notion of the 'noble savage' who is close to nature, honest and naive, and dependent on the white man for his salvation. Rarely do we see the Congolese exercising political agency, even though there are numerous civil society activists in the region, often working at great personal risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Baaz | first1=Maria Eriksson | last2=Gondola | first2=Didier | last3=Marijnen | first3=Esther | last4=Verweijen | first4=Judith | url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/africa/2015-03-05/virungas-white-savior-complex | title=Virunga's White Savior Complex | work=[[Foreign Affairs]] | date=March 5, 2015 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance in film==
{{main|White savior narrative in film}}
In film, the white savior is a [[trope (cinema)|cinematic trope]] in which a [[white people|white]] character rescues [[person of color|people of color]] from their plight. The white savior is portrayed as messianic and often learns something about themselves in the process of rescuing.&lt;ref name="temple1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/2263_reg.html | title=Matthew W. Hughey: The White Savior Film | work=temple.edu | publisher=[[Temple University]] | accessdate=October 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trope reflects how media represents [[sociology of race and ethnic relations|race relations]] by racializing concepts like morality as identifiable with white people over nonwhite people.&lt;ref name="temple2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/authors/2263_qa.html | title=Interview with Matthew W. Hughey | work=temple.edu | publisher=[[Temple University]] | accessdate=October 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; White saviors are often male and are sometimes out of place in their own society until they lead minorities or foreigners. ''Screen Saviors: Hollywood Fictions of Whiteness'' labels the stories as fantasies that "are essentially grandiose, exhibitionistic, and narcissistic". Types of stories include white travels to "exotic" Asian locations, white defense against racism in the [[Southern United States|American South]], or white protagonists having "racially diverse" helpers.&lt;ref name="vera"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Vera | first1=Hernán | last2=Gordon | first2=Andrew M. | year=2003 | chapter=The Beautiful White American: Sincere Fictions of the Savior | title=Screen Saviors: Hollywood Fictions of Whiteness | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | isbn=978-1-4616-4286-2 | pages=32–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance in television==

Stephanie Greco Larson, writing in ''Media &amp; Minorities: The Politics of Race in News and Entertainment'', said ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' (1978–1986) and ''[[Webster (TV series)|Webster]]'' (1983–1987) were "shows in which white families adopt black children" and represented versions of "the white man's burden theme on television".&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite book | last=Larson | first=Stephanie Greco | year=2006 | chapter=African Americans in Film and Television Entertainment | title=Media &amp; Minorities: The Politics of Race in News and Entertainment | series=Spectrum Series: Race and Ethnicity in National and Global Politics | publisher=Rowmn &amp; Littlefield | isbn=978-0-8476-9453-2 | pages=32–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robin R. Means Coleman said, "In these comedies, Black children are rescued from their dysfunctional families or communities by Whites."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Coleman | first=Robin R. Means | year=2003 | chapter=Black Sitcom Portrayals | editor1-last=Dines | editor1-first=Gail | editor2-last=Humez | editor2-first=Jean M. | title=Gender, Race, and Class in Media: A Text-Reader | edition=2nd | publisher=SAGE | isbn=978-0-7619-2261-2 | page=83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, ''Diff'rent Strokes'' featured the white millionaire character Philip Drummond. Film historian [[Donald Bogle]] said, "The millionaire Drummond becomes a ''great white father figure'', able to provide the material comforts (as well as the subliminal emotional ones) and the cultural milieu that the Black community supposedly could never hope to match." Dustin Tahmahkera writes that Coleman labeled Drummond a "white savior" type who uses "his representational power to save the day by determining a conflict resolution that appeases all parties" including the indigenous representative Longwalker in the episode "Burial Ground". Tahmahkera also said a 1985 episode of ''[[Punky Brewster]]'' featured the girl protagonist telling a ghost story about her alter-ego Princess Moon helping "ancient Indians [who] suddenly appear... as cave dwellers who need a white savior... to defeat an evil spirit and help keep their ''Last of the Dogmen''-like secret existence intact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Tahmahkera | first=Dustin | year=2014 | chapter=Settler Self-Determination | title=Tribal Television: Viewing Native People in Sitcoms | publisher=UNC Press Books | isbn=978-1-4696-1869-2 | pages=96–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Larson said, "Inner-city schools have been the site of white man's burden dramas on television for decades" with TV series featuring white savior teachers. Larson identified the following series with such teachers: ''[[Room 222]]'' (1969–1974), ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'' (1975–1979), ''[[The White Shadow (TV series)|The White Shadow]]'' (1978–1981), and ''[[Boston Public]]'' (2000–2004). Larson said while ''Room 222'' and ''Boston Public'' also had black teachers that "challenge the assumption that blacks are inherently inferior... these shows continue to avoid laying blame on social institutions for the status of blacks by showing the success of the individual black teachers."&lt;ref name="larson" /&gt;

The TV series ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'' (2017–) features [[Finn Jones]] as the superhero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. Both the originating comic book character and the TV series actor are white. Prior to the series airing ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the casting had received criticism for not changing the character to be Asian-American. The newspaper quoted arguments put forward by Keith Chow, editor-in-chief of ''The Nerds of Color'' pop culture blog, "If you’re going to have all these trappings of Orientalism on top of a white savior trope, why not upend both of those things by casting an Asian-American to play the role?" Jones denied that Iron Fist would be a white savior figure and said that the series would address critics' concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Victor | first=Daniel | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/arts/television/iron-fist-actor-at-center-of-whitewashing-debate-asks-fans-to-wait-and-see.html | title='Iron Fist' Actor, at Center of Whitewashing Debate, Asks Fans to Wait and See | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 8, 2017 | accessdate=March 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="White Savior Industrial Complex"==
[[File:Teju Cole.jpg|right|thumbnail|Writer Teju Cole, who coined the term "White Savior Industrial Complex"]]
Writer [[Teju Cole]] coined the term "White Savior Industrial Complex" following the release of the documentary ''[[Kony 2012]]'' in March 2012, extrapolating the term in a seven-part response on [[Twitter]]. He later wrote an article for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' about the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cole | first=Teju | authorlink=Teju Cole | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/the-white-savior-industrial-complex/254843/ | title=The White-Savior Industrial Complex | journal=[[The Atlantic]] | date=March 21, 2012 | accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote frame|
# From Sachs to Kristof to Invisible Children to TED, the fastest growth industry in the US is the White Savior Industrial Complex.
# The white savior supports brutal policies in the morning, founds charities in the afternoon, and receives awards in the evening.
# The banality of evil transmutes into the banality of sentimentality. The world is nothing but a problem to be solved by enthusiasm.
# This world exists simply to satisfy the needs--including, importantly, the sentimental needs--of white people and Oprah.
# The White Savior Industrial Complex is not about justice. It is about having a big emotional experience that validates privilege.
# Feverish worry over that awful African warlord. But close to 1.5 million Iraqis died from an American war of choice. Worry about that.
# I deeply respect American sentimentality, the way one respects a wounded hippo. You must keep an eye on it, for you know it is deadly.

Cole's response became a [[viral phenomenon]], and ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Bhakti Shringarpure reflected on the supportive Internet response to the ''Kony 2012'' political campaign, "With the prevalence of campaigns, apps and games calling on us to help without really putting ourselves out, it seems that the white saviour idea is still alive and well – but now, the mode is digital."&lt;ref name="shringarpure" /&gt; Heather Laine Talley, writing in ''Saving Face: Disfigurement and the Politics of Appearance'', said of the response to Cole coining the term, "The very idea of the white savior industrial complex was met with both celebration and rage. Cole was alternately described as a truth teller and as a racist." Talley summarized Cole's response to his critics, "Ultimately, Cole implores Western (white) do-gooders to rethink doing good in two ways. First, own up to the motives that drive philanthropic interventions, so that personal catharsis does not subsume the real need of others. Second, consider the structural underpinnings and historical legacies that together sustain the very infrastructure of the problems that captivate our activist hearts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Talley | first=Heather Laine | year=2014 | title=Saving Face: Disfigurement and the Politics of Appearance | publisher=NYU Press | isbn=978-0-8147-8411-2 | pages=128–129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Engles, writing in ''Rhetorics of Whiteness: Postracial Hauntings in Popular Culture, Social Media, and Education'', concurred with Cole's assessment, "The lack of real-world efficacy of their efforts, and the apparent unwillingness of most to go any further than such limited and self-aggrandizing steps, suggests that mere validation of white racial privilege was indeed the most significant outcome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Engles | first=Tim | year=2016 | chapter=Racialized Slacktivism | editor1-last=Kennedy | editor1-first=Tammie M. | editor2-last=Middleton | editor2-first=Irene Joyce | editor3-last=Ratcliffe | editor3-first=Krista | title=Rhetorics of Whiteness: Postracial Hauntings in Popular Culture, Social Media, and Education | publisher=SIU Press | isbn=978-0-8093-3546-6 | page=98 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In news and political media==
{{expand-section|date=January 2018}}
The removal of [[Malala Yousafzai]] from Pakistan and her medical treatment in the West has been described as an example of the "white savior complex". The arguments behind this were the Western media and politicians quick reaction to the incident, portraying it as their rescue of a woman from her own savage culture and people. This also allegedly was the West's justification for invading and bombing the region to save savage people from their own kind, while killing more innocent people like Malala than the Taliban has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/assed-baig/malala-yousafzai-white-saviour_b_3592165.html|title=Malala Yousafzai and the White Saviour Complex|date=15 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bennorton.com/malala-yousafzai-spivak-abu-lughod-and-the-white-savior-complex/|title=Malala Yousafzai, Spivak, Abu-Lughod, &amp; the White Savior Complex|date=12 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wristbands''' are encircling strips worn on the wrist or lower forearm. The term can be used to refer to a [[bracelet]]-like band, similar to that of a [[watch|wristwatch]], to the [[cuff]] or other part of a [[sleeve]] that covers the wrist, or to decorative or functional bands worn on the wrist for many different reasons. Wristbands are often worn and used similarly to event passes such as [[lanyard]]s to information or allow people entry to events. These wristbands are made from loops of [[plastic]] that are placed around the [[wrist]] and are used for identification purposes (demonstrating the wearer's authorization to be at a [[Music venue|venue]], for example).

Another type of wristband is the [[sweatband]]; usually made of a towel-like [[terrycloth]] material. These are usually used to wipe sweat from the forehead during sport but have been known to be used as a badge or [[fashion statement]]. A practice common in mid-1980s [[Punk subculture|punk]] [[subculture]] was to cut the top off of a [[sock]] and fashion the [[Elastomer|elastic]] into this type of wristband.

In the early-to-mid-2000s (decade), bracelets often made of [[silicone]] became popular. They are worn to demonstrate the wearer's support of a [[Social movement|cause]] or [[charitable organization]], similar to [[awareness ribbon]]s. Such wristbands are sometimes called [[awareness bracelets]] to distinguish them from other types of wristbands. In early 2007 they became an increasingly popular item being sold as merchandise at concerts &amp; sporting events worldwide. The wristbands bearing official logos or trademarks enabled the seller to offer a low price point merchandise option to fans. Silicone wristbands may also be called gel wristbands, jelly wristbands, rubber wristbands and fundraising wristbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.wristbandbros.com/glossary/silicone-wristband/|title = Silicone Wristbands Explained|date = 9 September 2015|accessdate = 9 September 2015|website = Wristband Bros|publisher = Sean Mulligan|last = Mulligan|first = Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these wristbands are made from the same silicone material.

== UV ultra violet wristbands ==
UV Ultra Violet Sensitive silicone wristbands appear clear/white when out of UV light, but when exposed to ultra violet light such as sunlight the wristbands' color changes to blue or fuchsia. These bands can be used as reminders for people to apply sunscreen or stay in the shade on hot summer days.

== Hospital wristbands ==
[[File:LB2-ADULT-L3 Assembled.jpg|thumb|Example of hospital wristband|right]]
Hospital wristbands are a commonly used safety device for identifying patients undergoing medical care (see [[patient safety]] and [[medical identification tag]]). Available in a variety of sizes to accommodate patients as small as newborns and as large as obese adults, hospital wristbands can be handwritten, embossed, laser-printed or thermal-imaged with names, pictures, medical record numbers, barcodes and other personal identifiers.

Laser printing and thermal imaging—the most advanced technologies for personalizing hospital wristbands—support fonts, colors and barcodes for improved [[patient safety]] through electronic patient and medication tracking. Handwritten and embossed wristbands remain in widespread use, however, despite findings on compromised safety reported in 2007. The [[National Patient Safety Agency]] (NPSA) found that as many as 2,900 patients each year were receiving the wrong medical care because of the hospital staff's inability to read damaged or otherwise illegible patient information on handwritten and embossed wristbands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrls.npsa.nhs.uk/resources/?entryid45=59824&lt;/ref&gt;

Colored wristbands are often given to people attending events such as [[music festival]]s and gigs, as an [[access control]] measure. Counterfeit wristbands are increasingly common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2009/1127/1224259509420.html|title=Coming soon to a music festival near you: the wristband racket|last=Boyd|first=Brian|date=27 November 2009|work=Irish Times|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/readingleeds-festival/50091|title=Reading And Leeds Festival organiser warns fans against ticket and wristband scam|date=5 March 2010|work=NME|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silicone Wristbands (some times referred to as [[Gel bracelet]]s) are popular for fundraising or showing support for a cause. [[Custom wristbands]] are usually created by an event organizer and given out or sold to others interested in the event or supporting the cause.

Some people keep the wristbands as [[souvenir]]s or wear the wristbands after the event to show what events they went to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Reilly|first=John|title=No brief: graphic designers' personal projects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kU43im8AMUwC&amp;pg=PA44|series=Rockport Publishers|year=2002|isbn=2-88046-694-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further uses for the wristband in event ticketing at music festivals and sporting events may include an NFC ([[near field communication]]) chip that would allow [[contactless payment]] at the concessions and turnstiles. Wristbands are ideal to use for dark environments such as night clubs and bars or outdoor venues where patrons can be afar such as festivals and theme parks. 

In addition these styles of colored wristbands are used with the above listed hospital patient bands to serve as an extra  safety reminder and alert for [[Allergy|Allergies]]. They will have a standard color and will have written labeling such as "Fall Risks"(which may come from medical conditions, injuries and/or medications used with the possibility of all of the above causing the increased safety risk warning), "Allergies"(to cover allergic reactions to vast to list per band type risks), "Latex Allergies"( to make sure medical safety gloves are not made of latex which is an immediate risk more than other allergies), amongst several other important cautions that would protect the patient by preventing [[Iatrogenic]] mistakes, reducing additional medical complications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4985">[[File:Yoke-bullock.JPG|right|thumb|An English wooden yoke, bows and chain, used to harness two oxen together.]]'''A yoke''' was a unit of land measurement used in [[Kent]] in England at the time of the [[Domesday Book]] for tax purposes. It was equal to a quarter of a sulung. A sulung was the amount of land which could be ploughed by 4 ox-pairs (or approximately 2 hides), therefore a yoke was a pair of oxen, representing the amount of land that could be cultivated by an ox pair. A [[yoke]] also described the device used to harness two oxen together (see photo).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk/glossary.html Domesday Book Online], accessed 15 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everingham.com/family/data2/rec0034.html Understanding Old World &amp; Medieval era Measurements], accessed 30 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://four-villages-conservation.org.uk/index.php/193/ Glossary of Terms used in the Domesday Book]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, the Ickham, Littleborne and Wickhambreaux Conservation Society&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angles, Saxons, Jutes in Britain year 600.jpg|left|thumb|Angles, Saxons, Jutes in Britain year 600]]
In early [[Saxon]] times nearly all the [[Weald|Weald of Kent]], the land between the chalk ridges of the [[North Downs|North]] and [[South Downs|South]] Downs, was covered in ancient broadleaf forest but there are indications that much of what is now [[Penshurst]] had been cultivated clearings since Roman days. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] left no tangible relics although we have a record of their measurement for land in the "Yokes" of Chested, Vexour, Chafford etc. The yoke is the old Roman ''[[jugerum]]'', about 25 [[are (unit)|are]]s or 0.625 [[acre]]s. This word has survived only in Kent. One theory is that the [[Jutes]] conquered Kent, whereas the [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]] (c 450 AD) settled over the remainder of England. In these "yokes" along the banks of the river Medway crops such as corn would have been cultivated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penshurst-online.co.uk/Things_to_know_history%20of%20penshurst.htm History of Penshurst, Penshurst Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''joch'' is a traditional unit of area in German speaking countries, especially in [[Austria]]. One ''joch'' is the area of a square 40 ''[[klafter]]s'' (about 83 yards) on a side. This comes to 0.5755 [[hectare]]s or about 1.422 [[acre]]s. The plural is ''Joche''. ''Joch'' is also the word for a yoke in German, so this unit represents an area that could be ploughed in a day by a yoke of oxen. In what is now the [[Czech Republic]] this unit was known as the ''jitro''; in [[Croatia]] it is the ''jutro''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictJ.html ''How Many? A Dictionary of Units of Measurement''] by Russ Rowlett and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

There are references to the yoke or ''[[jugerum|jugum]]'' in Kentish medieval records and in the Domesday survey. The rental record of [[Gillingham, Kent|Gillingham]] dated 1477 reveals that the yoke was a fiscal land division for purposes of rents and services, and had its own privileges. Its size was clearly related to its fertility and position. For example, an [[Otford]] rental of c.1425 lists a full yoke on the fertile soil of the valley as 120 acres, a figure to which many of these yokes approximate, but on the poor clay soils on the Downs one yoke is 231 acres.&lt;ref name=OT&gt;{{Citation

[[File:View towards Otford - geograph.org.uk - 1315084.jpg|right|thumb|A modern view of Otford across the fields - geograph.org.uk - 1315084.jpg]] The stability of names of yokes was remarkable: in Otford, almost all the names recorded in 1285 survived to 1447. The fields of yokes were large enclosures, not open fields, and the land within them, although possibly cultivated co-operatively by many tenants, was usually held severally. It appears that the yoke was a compact holding and this is further suggested by early tenancies. In the 1285 Gillingham [[custumal]], it is recorded that 73.6 percent of the tenants possessed a single yoke of land. By 15th century [[gavelkind]] tenure gave rise to an accentuated dispersal of settlement in Kent and many holdings were split and became uneconomic. Thus by the 15th century, yokes comprised one or more large fields farmed in many separate parcels. They were fiscal units with certain defined rights and privileges. Most of them still had a central farm, and they had at some time in the past been single land units.&lt;ref name=OT/&gt;
