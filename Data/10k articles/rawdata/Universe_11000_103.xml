== Biography ==
A. P. B. Sinha, born on 27 December 1928, joined the [[University of London]] from where he secured a PhD in 1954; his thesis was based on solid state chemistry.&lt;ref name="Indian fellow" /&gt; Later, he served the [[National Chemical Laboratory]], Pune as a director's grade scientist and headed the Physical Chemistry division of the institution. Continuing his researches on solid state chemistry, he studied low mobility semiconductors with respect to its electron transport and crystal distortions caused by electron lattice transitions, switching, magnetic ordering and memory effects. He is known to have synthesized new manganites and reportedly developed a number of solid state products such as [[thermistors]], photocells, magnets and photovoltaic products. Based on his studies on electron lattice interaction, he proposed support theories for the [[ferroelectricity]] theory and developed new theories on the ''thermoelectrical power and mobility in semiconductors''.&lt;ref name="Handbook of Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize Winners"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csirhrdg.res.in/ssb.pdf | title=Handbook of Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize Winners | publisher=Council of Scientific and Industrial Research | date=1999 | accessdate=October 5, 2016 | pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; His researches are reported to have widened the understanding of conduction in semiconductors. The body of his literary work is composed of one book, ''Spectroscopy in inorganic chemistry'',&lt;ref name="Spectroscopy in inorganic chemistry"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/spectroscopy-in-inorganic-chemistry/oclc/636106622#details-allauthors |title=Spectroscopy in inorganic chemistry |last=Carl Johan Ballhausen, D R Eaton; J W Hastie; R H Hauge; J L Margrave; A S N Murthy; William L Baun; David W Fischer; A Chakravorty; Harry D Schultz; H B Mathur; Chintamani Nagesa Ramachandra Rao, Chemiker Indien; Jack M Williams; S W Peterson; John R Ferraro; Johannes Arnoldus Koningstein; K D J Root; Max T Rogers; H A Kuska; Brian G Ramsey; A P B Sinha |publisher=Academic Press |year=1970 |oclc=636106622}}&lt;/ref&gt; chapters to the book, ''A study of the growth and structure of layers of oxides, sulphides and related compounds, with special reference to the effect of temperature'', edited by [[C.

The '''American Radiator Company''' was established in 1892 by the merger of a number of North American [[radiator]] manufacturers. The company expanded in the early 20th century into Europe under the brand '''National Radiator Company'''.

In 1929 it amalgamated with the [[Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company]] to form the [[American Standard Companies|American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation]].

==History==

===Predecessors===
The '''Michigan Radiator &amp; Iron Manufacturing Company''' was founded in 1888. John B. Dyar manager and owner of the Detroit Metal &amp; Heating Works was the main promoter.{{sfn|Burton|1922| p= 599|}} Clarence M. Woolley joined the firm in 1887.{{sfn|Ingham|1983|p=1675}}

The '''Detroit Radiator Company''' was formed in 1882  by Henry C. and Charles C. Hodges.{{sfn|Burton|1922| p= 599|}}

The '''Pierce Steam Heating Company''' was founded in 1881 by [[John B. Pierce]] and Joseph Bond in  Buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=| title = The beginnings of a century of steam and water heating| first = Susan Reed|last =  Stifler| publisher =H. B. Smith Co.|year = 1960|page =106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Standard Radiator Company''' (Buffalo) was established by Nelson Holland.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://archive.org/details/historyofbuffalo02larn| title = A history of Buffalo : delineating the evolution of the city |volume =2| year = 1911| first = J.N.| last = Lanard| publisher = The Progress of the Empire State Company|page  = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Radiator Company===
[[File:100 year old radiator.jpg|thumb|upright|a radiator built by the company (photographed 2013)]]

The American Radiator company was formed in 1891/2 from the Detroit Radiator Company, the Michigan Radiator &amp; Iron Manufacturing Company, and the Pierce Steam Heating Company of Buffalo.{{sfn|Ingham|1983|p=1675}}{{sfn|Burton|1922| p= 599|}}  The company was headed by Joseph Bond, (of Pierce Steam Heating Co.), as President, Charles Hodges, (of Detroit Radiator) as Treasurer, and Clarence Woolley (of Michigan Radiator) as Secretary.{{sfn |''Fortune Magazine''|1935|p=83}}

The company made a profit of $400,000 in its first year, but was subsequently affected by an economic depression (see also [[Panic of 1893]]). In 1894, Mr. Woolley convinced the other officers of the company to pay his way to Europe, whereupon he booked the sale of $50,000 worth of cast iron radiators for the Swiss capitol.{{sfn |''Fortune Magazine''|1935|p=161}} This was the start of the company's entry into the European market. By the following year, the company had established a branch in London, England.{{sfn |''Fortune Magazine''|1935|p=161}} The company began manufacturing in several west European countries, starting in 1898 and continuing into the 1920s.{{sfn |''Fortune Magazine''|1935|p=161}}{{sfn|Ingham|1983|p=1676}}

The company was successful in the United States and European markets, and attracted the attention of [[J.P. Morgan]]. Morgan helped the firm to combine most of the radiator manufactories in the US. {{sfn|Ingham|1983|p=1675}} In 1899, the company was re-incorporated under the same name, absorbing the ''St. Louis Radiator Manufacturing Company'', and the ''Standard Radiator Manufacturing Company of Buffalo'', and the radiator business of the ''Titusville Iron Company'' (Pennsylvania).{{sfn|Burton|1922| p= 599|}}  After the death of Mr. Bond in 1902, Mr. Woolley, at age 39, succeeded him as President and Chairman of the Board.{{sfn |''Fortune Magazine''|1935|p=161}}

The [[American Radiator Building]] was constructed in New York in 1924.{{sfn|Ingham|1983|p=1676}} In the 1920s the company added several manufacturing plants in the US, as well as expanding a distribution network.{{sfn|Ingham|1983|p=1676}}

In 1929 the [[Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company]] consolidated with the American Radiator Company to form the [[American Standard Companies|American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation]].

In 1894, following the [[Panic of 1893]] and the consequent fall in demand for its products the company began investigating the potential of Europe as a market, and a sales branch was opened in London.{{sfn|Wilkins|2010|pp=327-8}} In 1897, the company began investigating manufacturing in Europe, specifically France and Germany, countries with high trade tariffs; a branch was opened in Hamburg, which assembled and machine finished cast radiator parts shipped in [[Knock-down kit|knock down form]].{{sfn|Wilkins|2010|pp=330-1}} In 1898, the company acquired the established plant of Louis Courtot, in Dôle, France ([[Dole, Jura]]) forming the ''Compagnie Nationale de Radiateurs''.{{sfn|Wilkins|2010|p=331}} In 1901, the company made the decision to establish a manufacturing plant in Germany, a site was selected in [[Schoenebeck]].{{sfn|Wilkins|2010|pp=333-6}} Both establishments proved successful and in 1905 the company began planning for a factory in England, and a site was selected in [[Kingston-upon-Hull|Hull]].{{sfn|Wilkins|2010|pp=337-8}}

By 1906 the European operations were so successful that on one occasion profits generated exceeded those from the company's American operations. Much of the profit was re-invested in expansion, and the construction of new factories was initiated in Italy (1910, opened 1911) and Austria (1912, opened by 1914).{{sfn|Wilkins|2010|pp=339-340, 341-2}}

During [[World War I]] the plant became in involved in war work: the Dôle plant was requisitioned by the French state, and manufactured shells; the German, Italian, and Austrian plants were also involved in producing munitions for their respective states; the English plant agreed to supply Belgium with hand-grenades, and also undertook contracts for the British state.&lt;ref name ="ww1"&gt;{{citation| url = | title = Multinational Corporations: Emergence and Evolution |first = Paz Estrella |last = Tolentino| year = 2000| publisher = Routledge|isbn = 0 415 14575 9 |at = Notes. 4. pp. 73–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European operations were incorporated into the [[American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation]] in 1929, forming the basis of that company's international operations.{{sfn|Wilkins|2010|p=346}}

===Compagnie Nationale de Radiateurs===
[[File:Dammarie-les-lys-usine-radiateurs.jpg|[[Dammarie-lès-Lys]] factory (1935)|thumb]]
In the 1880s engineer Louis Courtot developed a central heating system using radiators and boiler, and established a foundry in Dole (Jura).&lt;ref name="paris"&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.atlas-patrimoine93.fr/pg-html/bases_doc/inventaire/fiche.php?idfic=005inv028| title = Compagnie Nationale des Radiateurs ; Ideal Standard ; ZA Chanteloup (Aulnay-sous-Bois) [005inv028]| work  =Atlas du Patrimoine de la Seine-Saint-Denis|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factory was acquired by the American Radiator Company in 1898, and a new company established as the '''''Compagnie Nationale de Radiateurs''''', with a capital of 500,000 francs. Courtot became the managing director of the plant.{{sfn|Wilkins|2010|pp=331-2}} The company had with low wage costs and fair productivity, resulting in a saving compared to importing products. By 1903 the plant employed 180 people.{{sfn|Wilkins|2010|pp=333, 335, 337}}

In 1905 the company opened a new factory in Dole, and the earlier factory gradually ceased production. The factory became the largest in Dole employing nearly 2000. During the [[First World War]] the plant produced 155 and 380mm artillery shells, employing mainly female workers. At the end of the war, the shortage of manpower led to managed immigration of polish workers, with a housing built for their families.&lt;ref name="nrfr"&gt;{{citation|journal = Pay Dolois| number = 69| date = February 2006| url =http://www.paysdolois.fr/pdf/pays-dolois/PD69.pdf | title = Idéal Standard: une usine centenaire|pages = 6–7| language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s new plant were constructed at [[Clichy-sous-Bois]]/[[Aulnay-sous-Bois]] and [[Argenteuil]].&lt;ref name="nrfr"/&gt;&lt;ref name="danmarie"/&gt; As a consequence, in 1932 the plant in Dole switched to the manufacture of bathroom furniture, including [[porcelain]] sanitary ware.&lt;ref name="nrfr"/&gt;

The Aulnay-sur-Bois plant opened in 1923. The two main factory buildings {{convert|270|by|70|m}} were built of reinforced concrete by the [[Limousin]] company to the designs of [[Eugène Freyssinet]]. An extension was built in 1930, also by Limousin. Foundry work (boilers, cast iron baths) was switched to Aulnay.&lt;ref name="paris"/&gt;

In 1929 a factory was opened in [[Dammarie-lès-Lys]]; the factory structure was also to the design of Freyssinet/Limousin. From 1931, the factory was used entirely for the manufacture of radiators, with a staff of 750.&lt;ref name="danmarie"&gt;{{citation|url=http://dammarie-les-lys.info/index.php/connaitre-la-ville-de-dammarie-les-lys/histoire/109-ideal-standard.html |title=Les Mécomptes d'Idéal Standard |first=Richard |last=Michel |work=dammarie-les-lys.info |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016022634/http://dammarie-les-lys.info/index.php/connaitre-la-ville-de-dammarie-les-lys/histoire/109-ideal-standard.html |archivedate=2014-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, after the parent company had become involved in the production of bathroom furniture (see [[American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corporation]], formed 1929) the company was renamed "Idéal Standard".&lt;ref name="nrfr"/&gt;

Manufacture of radiators in Aulnay ceased in 1968.&lt;ref name="danmarie"/&gt; The [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] negatively affected the company's activities, and the plant in Aulnay closed.&lt;ref name="paris"/&gt; The Dammarie plant closed in 1975.&lt;ref name="danmarie"/&gt; In 1975, production of bathroom furniture ended at Dole. A new company ''Société Nouvelle Idéal Standard'' was established under the control of Société Générale de Fonderie (65%) and Société de Dietrich. In 1984 the company came back under the control of [[American Standard Companies|American Standard]]. Bath production using [[acrylate polymer|acrylic]] resin started in 1986.&lt;ref name="nrfr"/&gt;

In 1996 the company [[Sanifrance]] was created by the combination of activities of Idéal Standard, Porcher, Piel and Emafrance as a subsidiary of American Standard. In 2005 Sanifrance became ''Idéal Standard France'', and in 2006 ''Idéal Standard Industrie France''.&lt;ref name="nrfr"/&gt;

===Nationale Radiator Gesellschaft mbH===
In 1900 the American Radiator Company decided to add a foundry to their existing operations in Germany, which had been assembling and finishing imported radiator parts in Hamburg from the late 1890s.{{sfn|Wilkins|2010|pp=331, 334-6}} In 1901 ''Nationale Radiator Gesellschaft mbH'' was formed in Berlin as a subsidiary of the American Radiator Company; a factory was established at [[Schönebeck]] in 1902. The company was known under the abbreviation NARAG.&lt;ref name="de"&gt;{{citation| url =http://www.ikz.de/1996-2005/2001/17/0117046.php| language = german| title = UNTERNEHMEN : Sanitärgeschichte geschrieben| year = 2001|issue =17| page =46| journal = IKZ Haustechnik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional factory was established in [[Neuss]] and production of radiators concentrated at Neuss, boilers at Schoenebeck. With the incorporation in 1919 of the [[Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Company|Standard Sanitary company]] into the parent company, its German subsidiaries were also merged into a division of NARAG, adding cast iron baths, brass water fittings, and porcelain bathroom fittings to the company's output.&lt;ref name="de"/&gt;

During World War I the factory manufactured shells for the [[German Empire]].&lt;ref name= "ww1"/&gt; During the Second World War the Neuss factory was heavily targeted by bombing campaigns and required rebuilding at the end of the war.&lt;ref name="de"/&gt; The Schoenebeck plant became a subsidiary of [[Volkswagen]] in 1944 and was used to manufacture [[V1 rocket]]s; the factory was supplied with slave labour from the Schoenebeck camp, a sub-camp of the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], an estimated 200-400 concentration camp prisoners were used at the plant, other employees during the period included forced labour from eastern Europe, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = | title = The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933-1945|editor-first = Geoffrey P.|editor-last = Megargee| editorlink = Geoffrey P. Megargee| publisher = Indiana University Press|year= 2009| volume=1|pages = 414–5, 416–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Schoenebeck facility was in soviet occupied [[East Germany]] at the end of the second world war; as a result in 1950 the Neuss site began production of boilers. In 1951 the company was renamed Ideal Standard GmbH. A refrigeration company 'Gesellschaft die Rheinkälte' (Düsseldorf) was acquired in 1955. In the 1960s, during the [[Wirtschaftswunder|German economic boom]] the company expanded, with a sites in [[Wittlich]] (radiators), and in [[Waldbröl]] und [[Berlin]] (boilers, radiators; acquired from the Projahn-Werkes).&lt;ref name="de"/&gt;

At the end of the 1960s the Wittlich site was concentrated on the production of fittings serving the whole European market; valve production was reduced at Neuss in favour of the Clichy factory in France, and the site in Neuss became focused on ceramic manufacture. In the mid 1970s the company withdrew from the heating business, and the sites in Waldbröl and Berlin shut.&lt;ref name="de"/&gt;

===National Radiator Company Limited===
[[File:Ideal Standard - geograph.org.uk - 596516.jpg|Ideal Boilers offices, Hull (2007)|thumb]]
In 1905 the company's operations in France and Germany were proving successful, and the firm decided to open a factory in England. The company "National Radiator Company, Ltd." was established, and $500,000 was provided for the establishment of a factory. A site in [[Kingston-upon-Hull]] was selected for the factory.{{sfn|Wilkins|2010|pp=337-8}}

Construction of the factory began in 1906, and the first casting was produced in December. The plant was expanded in 1910. During World War I, much of the production was shifted to the munition production. In 1917 the factory was further expanded, in anticipation of a post-war building boom.&lt;ref name="hull"/&gt;

In 1934 the company was publicly listed as "Ideal Boilers and Radiators" (capital £750,000) in order to raise cash for a factory extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| journal=The Times| date = 27 July 1934| title = Prelimary Notice - Ideal Boilers and Radiators Limited|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1938 a new plant producing vitreous sanitary ware had begun operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = | title = Ideal Boilers Expansion| journal = The Times| date = 7 April 1938| page = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II the plant produced munitions including mortar bombs and grenades, as well as boilers and vitreous china for military use.&lt;ref name="hull"/&gt;

In 1953 the company was renamed "Ideal Standard".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url  =http://idealboilers.com/installer/blog/100-years-pioneering-innovation/| title = Over 100 years of pioneering innovation| date = 15 May 2014 | work = idealboilers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 the boiler and radiator operations of the plant were acquired by Stelrad Group ([[Metal Box company|Metal Box]]), whilst the vitreous china (bathroom furniture) operations remained under the control of Ideal Standard. Radiator production was ended at Stelrad's Hull site, and production was focused on boilers.&lt;ref name="hull"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hevac-heritage.org/electronic_books/ideal_boilers/Ideal-Boilers-3.pdf| title = Ideal Boilers &amp; Radiators Ltd.| publisher = Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (Heritage website of)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the Metal Box company demergered, and MB group formed; [[Caradon plc|Caradon]] was acquired by MB group becoming MB Caradon in 1989 and the Hull boiler factory became Caradon Ideal in 1993.&lt;ref name="hull"/&gt;

In the 2010s the Ideal Boilers' [[foundry]] was closed with the loss of 57 jobs and outsource casting to third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.buildersmerchantsnews.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/9337/Ideal_Boilers_regenerates_Hull_site.html| title = Ideal Boilers regenerates Hull site| date =  19 May 2014 | work  = www.buildersmerchantsnews.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.scunthorpetelegraph.co.uk/West-Hull-s-Ideal-Heating-set-close-foundry-cut/story-13664338-detail/story.html| title = West Hull's Ideal Heating set to close foundry and cut up to 57 jobs| date = 26 October 2011| work = Scunthorpe Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014 the boiler plant operated as "Ideal Boilers" as part of the [[Ideal Stelrad]] group., and the bathroom fittings plant is part of [[Ideal Standard]].

In 2015 Ideal Boilers was acquired from holding company ''ISG Holdings 1'' by French HVAC business [[Groupe Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/French-firm-Groupe-Atlantic-buy-Ideal-Boilers/story-25813840-detail/story.html| title = French firm Groupe Atlantic to buy Ideal Boilers| date = 7 January 2015| work =  Hull Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/business/business-news/groupe-atlantic-buys-ideal-boilers-1-7038570| title = Groupe Atlantic buys Ideal Boilers| date = 7 January 2015| work =Yorkshire Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ball lightning''' is an unexplained and potentially dangerous [[atmospheric electricity|atmospheric electrical]] phenomenon.  The term refers to reports of [[Luminosity|luminous]], spherical objects that vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter. Though usually associated with [[thunderstorm]]s, the phenomenon lasts considerably longer than the split-second flash of a [[lightning]] bolt. Many{{quantify|date=June 2018}} early reports claim{{when?|date=June 2018}} that the ball eventually explodes, sometimes with fatal consequences, leaving behind the odor of sulfur.&lt;ref name="Rowe1905" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Day1813" /&gt;

Until the 1960s, most [[scientist]]s treated reports of ball lightning skeptically, despite numerous accounts from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/climate-weather/atmospheric/ball-lightning.htm How Stuff Works entry]. Retrieved 21 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory experiments can produce effects that are visually similar to reports of ball lightning, but how these relate to the natural phenomenon remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.livescience.com/61946-ball-lightning-quantum-particle.html | title=Thermodynamic and kinetic properties of nonideal Rydberg matter| journal=Soviet Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters| volume=92| issue=9| pages=630| last1=Manykin| first1=E.

Scientists have proposed many hypotheses about ball lightning over the centuries.  Scientific data on natural ball-lightning remains scarce, owing to its infrequency and unpredictability. The presumption of its existence depends on reported public sightings, which have produced somewhat inconsistent findings. Owing to inconsistencies and to the lack of reliable data, the true nature of ball lightning remains unknown.&lt;ref name=bam&gt;{{cite web |author = Anna Salleh |url = http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/03/20/2194630.htm?site=science&amp;topic=latest |title = Ball lightning bamboozles physicist |location= 35.2772;149.1292 |publisher = Abc.net.au |date = 2008-03-20 |accessdate = 21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ever optical spectrum of what appears to have been a ball-lightning event, published in January 2014, included a video at high frame-rate.&lt;ref name="BLspectrum"&gt;

== Historical accounts ==
It has been suggested that ball lightning could be the source of the legends that describe luminous balls, such as the mythological [[Anchimayen]] from Argentinean and Chilean [[Mapuche]] culture.

In a 1960 study, 5% of the population of the Earth reported having witnessed ball lightning.&lt;ref name="sciam-ask"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anon|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=periodically-i-hear-stori|publisher=Scientific American|title=Ask the experts|accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=J.

=== Great Thunderstorm of Widecombe-in-the-Moor ===
One early account was reported during [[the Great Thunderstorm]] at a church in [[Widecombe-in-the-Moor]], Devon, in England, on 21 October 1638. Four people died and approximately 60 were injured when, during a severe storm, an {{convert|8|ft|adj=on}} ball of fire was described as striking and entering the church, nearly destroying it. Large stones from the church walls were hurled into the ground and through large wooden beams. The ball of fire allegedly smashed the pews and many windows, and filled the church with a foul sulphurous odour and dark, thick smoke.

The ball of fire reportedly divided into two segments, one exiting through a window by smashing it open, the other disappearing somewhere inside the church. The explanation at the time, because of the fire and sulphur smell, was that the ball of fire was "the devil" or the "flames of hell". Later, some blamed the entire incident on two people who had been playing cards in the pew during the sermon, thereby incurring God's wrath.&lt;ref name="Rowe1905"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Two Widecombe Tracts, 1638[,] giving a Contemporary Account of the great Storm, reprinted with an Introduction|year=1905|publisher=James G Commin|location=Exeter|url=https://archive.org/details/devonandcornwal02unkngoog|editor=J.

=== The ''Catherine and Mary'' ===
In December 1726 a number of British newspapers printed an extract of a letter from John Howell of the sloop ''Catherine and Mary'':
{{bq|1=As we were coming thro’ the [[Gulf of Florida]] on 29th of August, a large ball of fire fell from the Element and split our mast in Ten Thousand Pieces, if it were possible; split our Main Beam, also Three Planks of the Side, Under Water, and Three of the Deck; killed one man, another had his Hand carried of {{sic}}, and had it not been for the violent rains, our Sails would have been of a Blast of Fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Foreign Affairs: Bristol 17 December|last=Anon|work=Weekly Journal or British Gazetteer|publisher=24 December 1726}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Foreign Affairs: London 24 December|last=Anon|date=24 December 1726|work=London Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== The ''Montague'' ===
One particularly large example was reported "on the authority of Dr. Gregory" in 1749:
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Admiral Chambers on board the [[HMS Montague (1654)|''Montague'']], 4 November 1749, was taking an observation just before noon...he observed a large ball of blue fire about three miles distant from them. They immediately lowered their topsails, but it came up so fast upon them, that, before they could raise the main tack, they observed the ball rise almost perpendicularly, and not above forty or fifty yards from the main chains when it went off with an explosion, as great as if a hundred cannons had been discharged at the same time, leaving behind it a strong sulphurous smell. By this explosion the main top-mast was shattered into pieces and the main mast went down to the keel.

Five men were knocked down and one of them very bruised. Just before the explosion, the ball seemed to be the size of a large mill-stone.&lt;ref name=Day1813&gt;{{cite journal|last=Day|first=Jeremiah|title=A view of the theories which have been proposed to explain the origin of meteoric stones|journal=The General Repository and Review|date=January 1813|volume=3|issue=1|pages=156–157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RV4oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA156-IA2|accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Georg Richmann ===
A 1753 report depicts ball lightning as having been lethal when professor [[Georg Richmann]] of [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, created a kite-flying apparatus similar to [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s proposal a year earlier.  Richmann was attending a meeting of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] when he heard thunder and ran home with his engraver to capture the event for posterity. While the experiment was under way, ball lightning appeared and travelled down the string, struck Richmann's forehead and killed him. The ball had left a red spot on Richmann's forehead, his shoes were blown open, and his clothing was singed. His engraver was knocked unconscious. The door frame of the room was split and the door was torn from its hinges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Ronald W. |authorlink=Ronald W.

=== HMS ''Warren Hastings'' ===
An English journal reported that during an 1809 storm, three "balls of fire" appeared and "attacked" the British ship ''[[HMS Warren Hastings]]''. The crew watched one ball descend, killing a man on deck and setting the main mast on fire. A crewman went out to retrieve the fallen body and was struck by a second ball, which knocked him back and left him with mild burns. A third man was killed by contact with the third ball. Crew members reported a persistent, sickening sulphur smell afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/weather/article5747952.ece |work=The Times  | location=London | title=Weather Eye Charles Darwin the meteorologist | date=17 February 2009 | accessdate=16 April 2010 | first=Paul | last=Simons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090223/FRONTIERS/646186738/1036&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ebenezer Cobham Brewer ===
[[Ebenezer Cobham Brewer]], in his 1864 US edition of ''[[A Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar]]'', discussed "globular lightning". He describes it as slow-moving balls of fire or explosive gas that sometimes fall to the earth or run along the ground during a thunderstorm. He said that the balls sometimes split into smaller balls and may explode "like a [[cannon]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brewer|first=Ebenezer Cobham|title=A Guide to the Scientific Knowledge of Things Familiar|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=ajn0728.0001.001;view=toc;frm=frameset|year=1864|pages=13–14|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wilfrid de Fonvielle ===
In his book ''Thunder and Lightning'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Fonvielle|first=Wilfrid|others=translated by T L Phipson|title=Thunder and lightning (full text)|year=1875|pages=32–39|chapter=Chapter X Globular lightning|isbn=978-1-142-61255-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hukDAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; translated into English in 1875, French science writer [[Wilfrid de Fonvielle]] wrote that there had been about 150 reports of globular lightning:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Globular lightning seems to be particularly attracted to metals; thus it will seek the railings of balconies, or else water or gas pipes etc, It has no peculiar tint of its own but will appear of any colour as the case may be&amp;nbsp;... at [[Coethen]] in the Duchy of Anhalt it appeared green.  M. Colon, Vice-President of the Geological Society of Paris, saw a ball of lightning descend slowly from the sky along the bark of a poplar tree; as soon as it touched the earth it bounced up again, and disappeared without exploding. On 10th of September 1845 a ball of lightning entered the kitchen of a house in the village of [[Salagnac]] in the valley of [[Correze]]. This ball rolled across without doing any harm to two women and a young man who were here; but on getting into an adjoining stable it exploded and killed a pig which happened to be shut up there, and which, knowing nothing about the wonders of thunder and lightning, dared to smell it in the most rude and unbecoming manner.

The motion of such balls is far from being very rapid&amp;nbsp;– they have even been observed occasionally to pause in their course, but they are not the less destructive for all that. A ball of lightning which entered the church of Stralsund, on exploding, projected a number of balls which exploded in their turn like shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Globular lightning|last=Anon|date=24 December 1867|work=The Leeds mercury|location=Leeds, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Tsar Nicholas II ===
[[Tsar Nicholas II]], the last Emperor of Russia, reported witnessing what he called "a fiery ball" while in the company of his grandfather, Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]: "Once my parents were away," recounted the [[Tsar]], "and I was at the [[all-night vigil]] with my grandfather in the small church in [[Alexander Palace|Alexandria]]. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and it seemed as if the peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the [[iconostasis]], there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I glanced at my grandfather&amp;nbsp;– his face was completely calm. He [[Sign of the Cross|crossed]] himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and he nodded his head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodox.net/russiannm/nicholas-ii-tsar-martyr-and-his-family.html |title=Tsar-Martyr Nicholas II and His Family |publisher=Orthodox.net |accessdate=13 July 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090617074756/http://www.orthodox.net/russiannm/nicholas-ii-tsar-martyr-and-his-family.html| archivedate= 17 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aleister Crowley ===
British occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] reported witnessing what he referred to as "globular electricity" during a thunderstorm on [[Newfound Lake|Lake Pasquaney]]&lt;ref&gt;There is no present-day ''Lake Pasquaney'' in New Hampshire, United States.  New Hampshire's [[Newfound Lake]] has a ''Camp Pasquaney''. However, part of the lake is known as Pasquaney Bay.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New Hampshire]] in 1916.  He was sheltered in a small cottage when he "noticed, with what I can only describe as calm amazement, that a dazzling globe of electric fire, apparently between six and twelve inches (15–30&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter, was stationary about six inches below and to the right of my right knee. As I looked at it, it exploded with a sharp report quite impossible to confuse with the continuous turmoil of the lightning, thunder and hail, or that of the lashed water and smashed wood which was creating a pandemonium outside the cottage. I felt a very slight shock in the middle of my right hand, which was closer to the globe than any other part of my body."&lt;ref name="AleisterCrowley"&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/confess/chapter83.html|first=Aleister|last=Crowley|title=The Confessions of Aleister Crowley: An Autobiography|chapter=Chp. 83|url=http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/confess/index.html|isbn=978-0-14-019189-9|publisher=Penguin|date=5 December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== R.C. Jennison ===
Jennison, of the Electronics Laboratory at the [[University of Kent]], described his own observation of ball lightning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was seated near the front of the passenger cabin of an all-metal airliner (Eastern Airlines Flight EA 539) on a late night flight from New York to Washington. The aircraft encountered an electrical storm during which it was enveloped in a sudden bright and loud electrical discharge (0005 h EST, March 19, 1963). Some seconds after this a glowing sphere a little more than 20&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter emerged from the pilot's cabin and passed down the aisle of the aircraft approximately 50&amp;nbsp;cm from me, maintaining the same height and course for the whole distance over which it could be observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jennison |first=R.

* [[Willy Ley]] discussed a sighting in Paris on 5 July 1852 "for which sworn statements were filed with the [[French Academy of Science]]". During a thunderstorm, a tailor living next to [[Church of the Val-de-Grâce]] saw a ball the size of a human head come out of the fireplace. It flew around the room, reentered the fireplace, and exploded in and destroyed the top of the chimney.&lt;ref name="ley196010"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Ley |first=Willy |date=October 1960 |title=The Moon Worm |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v19n02_1960-12#page/n28/mode/1up |department=For Your Information |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=56–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 30 April 1877, a ball of lightning entered the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] at [[Amritsar]], India, and exited through a side door.  Several people observed the ball, and the incident is inscribed on the front wall of Darshani Deodhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhnet.com/news/miracle-saved-panth |title=Miracle saved panth |publisher=Sikhnet.com |date=2009-12-21 |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 22 November 1894, an unusually prolonged instance of natural ball lightning occurred in [[Golden, Colorado]], which suggests it could be artificially induced from the atmosphere. The ''Golden Globe'' newspaper reported, "A beautiful yet strange phenomenon was seen in this city on last Monday night.  The wind was high and the air seemed to be full of electricity.  In front of, above and around the new Hall of Engineering of the [[Colorado School of Mines|School of Mines]], balls of fire played tag for half an hour, to the wonder and amazement of all who saw the display.  In this building is situated the dynamos and electrical apparatus of perhaps the finest electrical plant of its size in the state.  There was probably a visiting delegation from the clouds, to the captives of the dynamos on last Monday night, and they certainly had a fine visit and a roystering game of romp."&lt;ref&gt;''Golden Globe'', 24 November 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 22 May 1901 in the Kazakh city of [[Oral, Kazakhstan|Ouralsk]] in the Russian Empire (now Oral, Kazakhstan), "a dazzlingly brilliant ball of fire" descended gradually from the sky during a thunderstorm, then entered into a house where 21 people had taken refuge, "wreaked havoc with the apartment, broke through the wall into a stove in the adjoining room, smashed the stove-pipe, and carried it off with such violence that it was dashed against the opposite wall, and went out through the broken window".  The incident was reported in the ''Bulletin of the [[Société astronomique de France]]'' the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Stenhoff, ''Ball Lightning: An Unsolved Problem in Atmospheric Physics'' (Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2006) p70&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 1907 the [[Cape Naturaliste Lighthouse]] in Western Australia was hit by ball lightning. Lighthouse keeper Patrick Baird was in the tower at the time and was knocked unconscious. His daughter Ethel recorded the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite loa|WA|Cape%20Naturaliste|The Cape Naturaliste Lighthouse|accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ley discussed another incident in [[Bischofswerda]], Germany. On 29 April 1925 multiple witnesses saw a silent ball land near a mailman, move along a telephone wire to a school, knock back a teacher using a telephone, and bore perfectly round coin-sized holes through a glass pane. 700 feet of wire was melted, several telephone poles were damaged, an underground cable was broken, and several workmen were thrown to the ground but unhurt.{{r|ley196010}} 
* An early fictional reference to ball lightning appears in a children's book set in the 19th century by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Laura Ingalls|last=Wilder|authorlink=Laura Ingalls Wilder|title=On the Banks of Plum Creek|publisher=Harper Trophy|year=1937|isbn=978-0-06-440005-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books are considered historical fiction, but the author always insisted they were descriptive of actual events in her life. In Wilder's description, three separate balls of lightning appear during a winter blizzard near a cast iron stove in the family's kitchen. They are described as appearing near the stovepipe, then rolling across the floor, only to disappear as the mother ([[Caroline Ingalls]]) chases them with a willow-branch broom.&lt;ref name="GetlinePlaying"&gt;{{cite news|last=Getline|first=Meryl|url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/columnist/getline/2005-10-17-ask-the-captain_x.htm|title=Playing with (St. Elmo's) fire|work=USA Today|date=17 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pilots in World War II described an unusual phenomenon for which ball lightning has been suggested as an explanation. The pilots saw small balls of light moving in strange trajectories, which came to be referred to as [[foo fighter]]s.{{r|ley196010}}
* Submariners in the Second World War gave the most frequent and consistent accounts of small ball lightning in the confined submarine atmosphere. There are repeated accounts of inadvertent production of floating explosive balls when the battery banks were switched in or out, especially if misswitched or when the highly inductive electrical motors were misconnected or disconnected. An attempt later to duplicate those balls with a surplus submarine battery resulted in several failures and an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peter-thomson.co.uk/tornado/fusion/Ball_lightning_and_the_charge_sheath_vortex.html |title=Ball lightning – and the charge sheath vortex |publisher=Peter-thomson.co.uk |accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 6 August 1944, a ball of lightning went through a closed window in [[Uppsala]], Sweden, leaving a circular hole about {{Convert|5|cm}} in diameter. The incident was witnessed by residents in the area, and was recorded by a lightning strike tracking system&lt;ref&gt;This may be an incorrect translation of the word "blixtlokaliseringssystem" from the university article cited in the sources&lt;/ref&gt; on the Division for Electricity and Lightning Research at [[Uppsala University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hvi.uu.se/Lightning/blixtar/Klotblixt.html|language=Swedish|publisher=Uppsala University |title=Ett fenomen som gäckar vetenskapen |first=Anders |last=Larsson |date=23 April 2002 |accessdate=19 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the ball had only one tail and it rotated in the same direction as the ring. It was homogeneous and showed no transparency. In the first moment the ball hovered motionless, but then began to move forward on the same line with a constant speed of about {{Convert|1|m/s}}.

== Characteristics ==
Descriptions of ball lightning vary widely.  It has been described as moving up and down, sideways or in unpredictable trajectories, hovering and moving with or against the wind; attracted to,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ernmphotography.com/Pages/Ball_Lightning/BL_Info_10.html |title=BL_Info_10 |publisher=Ernmphotography.com |accessdate=13 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222205540/http://www.ernmphotography.com/Pages/Ball_Lightning/BL_Info_10.html |archivedate=22 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; unaffected by, or repelled from buildings, people, cars and other objects. Some accounts describe it as moving through solid masses of wood or metal without effect, while others describe it as destructive and melting or burning those substances. Its appearance has also been linked to [[Electric power transmission|power lines]],{{r|ley196010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amasci.com/weird/unusual/blold2.html |title=Unusual Phenomea Reports: Ball Lightning |publisher=Amasci.com |accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; altitudes of {{convert|1000|feet}} and higher, and during thunderstorms{{r|ley196010}} and calm weather. Ball lightning has been described as [[Transparency and translucency|transparent]], [[Transparency and translucency|translucent]], multicolored, evenly lit, radiating flames, filaments or sparks, with shapes that vary between spheres, ovals, tear-drops, rods, or disks.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, James Dale: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KHdIE3_lv1cC&amp;pg=PA35 Ball Lightning and Bead Lightning: Extreme Forms of Atmospheric Electricity]'', {{ISBN|0-306-40272-6}}, 1980, Plenum Press (p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ball lightning is often erroneously identified as [[St. Elmo's fire]]. They are separate and distinct phenomena.&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry, J.D. (1980a) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KHdIE3_lv1cC Ball Lightning and Bead Lightning: Extreme Forms of Atmospheric Electricity]''. 8–9.

The balls have been reported to disperse in many different ways, such as suddenly vanishing, gradually dissipating, absorption into an object, "popping," exploding loudly, or even exploding with force, which is sometimes reported as damaging.{{r|ley196010}} Accounts also vary on their alleged danger to humans, from lethal to harmless.

A review of the available literature published in 1972&lt;ref name="Charman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charman|first=Neil|date=14 December 1972|title=The enigma of ball Lightning|journal=New Scientist|volume=56|issue=824|pages=632–635 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCTpu1UVFsYC&amp;pg=PA633}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified the properties of a "typical" ball lightning, whilst cautioning against over-reliance on eye-witness accounts:
* They frequently appear almost simultaneously with cloud-to-ground lightning discharge
* They are generally spherical or pear-shaped with fuzzy edges
* Their diameters range from {{Convert|1|-|100|cm|sigfig=1}}, most commonly {{Convert|10|-|20|cm|abbr = on}}.
* Their brightness corresponds to roughly that of a domestic lamp, so they can be seen clearly in daylight
* A wide range of colours has been observed, red, orange, and yellow being the most common.
* The lifetime of each event is from 1 second to over a minute with the brightness remaining fairly constant during that time
* They tend to move, most often in a horizontal direction at a few metres per second, but may also move vertically, remain stationary or wander erratically.
* Many are described as having rotational motion
* It is rare that observers report the sensation of heat, although in some cases the disappearance of the ball is accompanied by the liberation of heat
* Some display an affinity for metal objects and may move along conductors such as wires or metal fences
* Some appear within buildings passing through closed doors and windows
* Some have appeared within metal aircraft and have entered and left without causing damage
* The disappearance of a ball is generally rapid and may be either silent or explosive
* Odors resembling [[ozone]], burning sulfur, or nitrogen oxides are often reported

== Direct measurements of natural ball lightning ==
[[File:Ball lightning spectrum.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Emission spectrum of ball lighning|The emission spectrum (intensity vs. wavelength) of a natural ball lightning]]
In January 2014, scientists from [[Northwest Normal University]] in [[Lanzhou]], [[China]], published the results of recordings made in July 2012 of the optical spectrum of what was thought to be natural ball lightning made by chance during the study of ordinary cloud–ground lightning on the [[Tibetan Plateau]].&lt;ref name="BLspectrum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BLspectrumvideo"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://physics.aps.org/articles/v7/5|title=Focus: First Spectrum of Ball Lightning|last1=Ball|first1=Philip|authorlink1=Philip Ball|date=17 January 2014|journal=Focus|accessdate=19 January 2014|doi=10.1103/Physics.7.5|volume=7|pages=5|bibcode = 2014PhyOJ...7....5B }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a distance of {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}}, a total of 1.64 seconds of digital video of the ball lightning and its spectrum was made, from the formation of the ball lightning after the ordinary lightning struck the ground, up to the optical decay of the phenomenon.  Additional video was recorded by a high-speed (3000 frames/sec) camera, which captured only the last 0.78 seconds of the event, due to its limited recording capacity.  Both cameras were equipped with [[slitless spectrograph]]s.  The researchers detected [[emission line]]s of neutral atomic [[silicon]], [[calcium]], [[iron]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]]—in contrast with mainly ionized nitrogen emission lines in the spectrum of the parent lightning. The ball lightning traveled horizontally across the video frame at an average speed equivalent of {{Convert|8.6|m/s|abbr = on}}. It had a diameter of {{Convert|5|m|abbr = on}} and covered a distance of about {{Convert|15|m|abbr = on}} within those 1.64 s.

Oscillations in the light intensity and in the oxygen and nitrogen emission at a frequency of 100 [[hertz]], possibly caused by the electromagnetic field of the [[alternating current|50&amp;nbsp;Hz]] [[overhead power line|high-voltage power transmission line]] in the vicinity, were observed. From the spectrum, the temperature of the ball lightning was assessed as being lower than the temperature of the parent lightning (&lt;{{Convert|15,000|-|30,000|K|lk = in}}). The observed data are consistent with vaporization of soil as well as with ball lightning's sensitivity to [[electric field]]s.&lt;ref name="BLspectrum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BLspectrumvideo" /&gt;

== Laboratory experiments ==
Scientists have long attempted to produce ball lightning in laboratory experiments. While some experiments have produced effects that are visually similar to reports of natural ball lightning, it has not yet been determined whether there is any relation.

[[Nikola Tesla]] reportedly could artificially produce {{Convert|1.5|in|adj = on}} balls and conducted some demonstrations of his ability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/forgottenfutures/tesla/tesla.htm |title=The New Wizard of the West |publisher=Homepage.ntlworld.com |accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was truly interested in higher voltages and powers, and remote transmission of power, so the balls he made were just a curiosity.&lt;ref name="Tesla, Nikola 1978"&gt;Tesla, Nikola (1978).

The International Committee on Ball Lightning (ICBL) held regular symposia on the subject.  A related group uses the generic name "Unconventional Plasmas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.planet.nl/~icblsec/noscript.html|title=Tenth international syposium on ball lightning/ International symposium III on unconventional plasmas|last=Anon|year=2008|publisher=ICBL|accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last ICBL symposium was tentatively scheduled for July 2012 in [[San Marcos, Texas]]  but was cancelled due to a lack of submitted abstracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cose.txstate.edu/isbl_12.html |title=ISBL-12 |accessdate=4 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604074802/http://www.cose.txstate.edu/isbl_12.html |archivedate=4 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Water plasma.jpg|right|thumb|A demonstration of the water discharge experiment]]

=== Water discharge experiments ===
Some scientific groups, including the [[Max Planck Institute]], have reportedly produced a ball lightning-type effect by discharging a high-voltage [[capacitor]] in a tank of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/334 |title='Ball lightning' created in German laboratory &amp;#124; COSMOS magazine |publisher=COSMOS magazine |date=7 June 2006 |accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/pfr/1/0/039/_pdf |title=Fireball Generation in a Water Discharge |author1=Youichi Sakawa |author2=Kazuyoshi Sugiyama |author3=Tetsuo Tanabe |author4=Richard More |website=Plasma and Fusion Research: Rapid Communications |date=12 July 2006 |accessdate=13 July 2009}} {{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home microwave oven experiments ===
Many modern experiments involve using a [[microwave oven]] to produce small rising glowing balls, often referred to as ''plasma balls''.
Generally, the experiments are conducted by placing a lit or recently extinguished match or other small object in a microwave oven. The burnt portion of the object flares up into a large ball of fire, while "plasma balls" float near the oven chamber ceiling. Some experiments describe covering the match with an inverted glass jar, which contains both the flame and the balls so that they don't damage the chamber walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jlnlabs.online.fr/plasma/gmr/index.htm |title=How to make a Stable Plasmoid ( Ball Lightning ) with the GMR (Graphite Microwave Resonator) by Jean-Louis Naudin |publisher=Jlnlabs.online.fr |date=22 December 2005 |accessdate=13 July 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090626155549/http://jlnlabs.online.fr/plasma/gmr/index.htm| archivedate= 26 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A glass jar, however, eventually explodes rather than simply causing charred paint or melting metal, as happens to the inside of a microwave.) Experiments by Eli Jerby and Vladimir Dikhtyar in Israel revealed that microwave plasma balls are made up of [[nanoparticle]]s with an average radius of {{Convert|25|nm}}. The Israeli team demonstrated the phenomenon with copper, salts, water and carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceinschool.org/2009/issue12/fireballs|title=Creating the 4th state of matter with microwaves by Halina Stanley|publisher=scienceinschool.org|date=13 August 2009 |accessdate=6 October 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091031100909/http://www.scienceinschool.org/2009/issue12/fireballs| archivedate= 31 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Silicon experiments ===
Experiments in 2007 involved shocking [[silicon]] wafers with electricity, which vaporizes the silicon and induces [[oxidation]] in the vapors. The visual effect can be described as small glowing, sparkling [[Orb (optics)|orbs]] that roll around a surface. Two Brazilian scientists, [[Antonio Pavão]] and [[Gerson Paiva]] of the [[Federal University of Pernambuco]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufpe.br/ |title=Universidade Federal de Pernambuco |publisher=Ufpe.br |accessdate=13 July 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090621072728/http://www.ufpe.br/| archivedate= 21 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; have reportedly consistently made small long-lasting balls using this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufpe.br/new/visualizar.php?id=5005 |title=Pesquisadores da UFPE geram, em laboratório, fenômeno atmosférico conhecido como bolas luminosas |publisher=Ufpe.br |date=16 January 2007|accessdate=13 July 2009 |archivedate=20 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220115152/http://www.ufpe.br/new/visualizar.php?id=5005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/01/070122-ball-lightning_2.html |title=Ball Lightning Mystery Solved? Electrical Phenomenon Created in Lab |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=21 November 2005|accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These experiments stemmed from the theory that ball lightning is actually oxidized silicon vapors ''(see [[#Vaporized silicon hypothesis|vaporized silicon hypothesis]], below)''.

== Proposed scientific explanations ==
There is at present no widely accepted explanation for ball lightning. Several hypotheses have been advanced since the phenomenon was brought into the scientific realm by the English physician and electrical researcher [[William Snow Harris]] in 1843,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Snow Harris|first=William|title=On the nature of thunderstorms (originally published in 1843)|publisher=Bastian Books|year=2008|edition=Reprint|pages=34–43|chapter=Section I|isbn=978-0-554-87861-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XSdHnUv1MKwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[French Academy of Sciences|French Academy]] scientist [[François Arago]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;François Arago, ''Meteorological Essays'' by , Longman, 1855&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vaporized silicon hypothesis ===
This hypothesis suggests that ball lightning consists of vaporized silicon [[combustion|burning]] through oxidation. Lightning striking Earth's soil could vaporize the silica contained within it, and somehow separate the oxygen from the silicon dioxide, turning it into pure silicon vapor. As it cools, the silicon could condense into a floating aerosol, bound by its charge, glowing due to the heat of silicon recombining with [[oxygen]]. An experimental investigation of this effect, published in 2007, reported producing "luminous balls with lifetime in the order of seconds" by evaporating pure silicon with an electric arc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paiva |first1=Gerson Silva |author2=Antonio Carlos Pavão |author3=Elder Alpes de Vasconcelos |author4=Odim Mendes, Jr. |author5=Eronides Felisberto da Silva, Jr. |year= 2007|title= Production of Ball-Lightning-Like Luminous Balls by Electrical Discharges in Silicon|journal=Phys.

Matthew Francis has dubbed this the "dirt clod hypothesis", in which the spectrum of ball lightning shows that it shares chemistry with soil.&lt;ref name=Francis2014&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/science/2014/01/the-dirty-secret-behind-ball-lightning-is-dirt/ Matthew Francis (1/22/2014, 11:30 AM) ''Ars Technica'' "The dirty secret behind ball lightning is dirt": First spectrum of ball lightning shows it shares chemistry with soil.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electrically charged solid-core model ===
In this model ball lightning is assumed to have a solid, positively charged core. According to this underlying assumption, the core is surrounded by a thin electron layer with a charge nearly equal in magnitude to that of the core. A vacuum exists between the core and the electron layer containing an intense [[electromagnetic field|electromagnetic (EM) field]], which is reflected and guided by the electron layer. The microwave EM field applies a [[ponderomotive force]] (radiation pressure) to the electrons preventing them from falling into the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muldrew | first1 = D.

=== Microwave cavity hypothesis ===
[[Pyotr Kapitsa]] proposed that ball lightning is a glow discharge driven by microwave radiation that is guided to the ball along lines of ionized air from lightning clouds where it is produced.  The ball serves as a resonant microwave cavity, automatically adjusting its radius to the wavelength of the microwave radiation so that resonance is maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink1=Pyotr Kapitsa|last1=Капица |first1=П.

The Handel Maser-Soliton theory of ball lightning hypothesizes that the energy source generating the ball lightning is a large (several cubic kilometers) atmospheric [[maser]]. The ball lightning appears as a plasma caviton at the antinodal plane of the microwave radiation from the maser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Handel |first1=Peter H. |author2=Jean-François Leitner |year=1994 |title= Development of the maser-caviton ball lightning theory |journal=J.

=== Soliton hypothesis ===
{{Main|Soliton|St. Elmo's fire}}

Julio Rubinstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rubinstein, J|url=http://inspirehep.net/author/profile/J.Rubinstein.1|website=Inspire HEP|accessdate=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Finkelstein]], and James R. Powell proposed that ball lightning is a detached St. Elmo's fire (1964–1970).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} St. Elmo's fire arises when a sharp conductor, such as a ship's mast, amplifies the atmospheric electric field to breakdown.  For a globe the amplification factor is 3. A free ball of ionized &lt;sup&gt;[explain]&lt;/sup&gt; air can amplify the ambient field this much by its own conductivity. When this maintains the ionization, the ball is then a [[soliton]] in the flow of atmospheric electricity.

Powell's kinetic theory calculation found that the ball size is set by the second Townsend coefficient (the mean free path of conduction electrons) near breakdown. Wandering glow discharges are found to occur within certain industrial microwave ovens and continue to glow for several seconds after power is shut off. [[electric arc|Arcs]] drawn from high-power low-voltage microwave generators also are found to exhibit afterglow. Powell measured their spectra, and found that the after-glow comes mostly from metastable [[nitric oxide|NO]] ions, which are long-lived at low temperatures. It occurred in air and in nitrous oxide, which possess such metastable ions, and not in atmospheres of argon, carbon dioxide, or helium, which do not.

The soliton model of a ball lightning was further developed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Electron gas oscillations in plasma.

Physicist Domokos Tar suggested the following theory for ball lightning formation based on his ball lightning observation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0910.0783|title=Observation of Lightning Ball (Ball Lightning): A new phenomenological description of the phenomenon |journal=Proceedings of the -th International Symposium on Ball Lightning, Aug. Eindhoven |volume=9 |issue=2006 |date=2009-10-05 |last1=Tar |first1=Domokos |bibcode = 2009arXiv0910.0783T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lightning strikes perpendicular to the ground, and thunder follows immediately at supersonic speed in the form of shock waves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1007.3348|title=Lightning Ball (Ball Lightning) Created by Thunder, Shock-Wave |date=2010-07-20 |last1=Tar |first1=Domokos |class=physics.gen-ph }}&lt;/ref&gt; that form an invisible aerodynamic turbulence ring horizontal to the ground. Around the ring, over and under pressure systems rotate the vortex around a circular axis in the cross section of the torus. At the same time, the ring expands concentrically parallel to the ground at low speed.

In an open space, the vortex fades and finally disappears. If the vortex's expansion is obstructed, and symmetry is broken, the vortex breaks into cyclical form. Still invisible, and due to the central and surface tension-forces, it shrinks to an intermediate state of a cylinder, and finally into a ball. The resulting transformation subsequently becomes visible once the energy is concentrated into the final spherical stage.

The ball lightning has the same rotational axis as the rotating cylinder. As the vortex has a much smaller vector of energy compared to the overall energy of the reactant sonic shock wave, its vector is likely fractional to the overall reaction. The vortex, during contraction, gives the majority of its energy to form the ball lightning, achieving nominal energy loss.

In some observations, the ball lightning appeared to have an extremely high energy concentration&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; but this phenomenon hasn't been adequately verified. The present theory concerns only the low energy lightning ball form, with centripetal forces and surface tension. The visibility of the ball lightning can be associated with electroluminescence, a direct result of the triboelectric effect from materials within the area of the reaction. Static discharge from the cylindrical stage imply the existence of contact electrification within the object. The direction of the discharges indicate the cylinder's rotation, and resulting rotational axis of the ball lightning in accordance to the law of laminar flow. If the ball came from the channel, it would have rotated in the opposite direction.

One theory that may account for the wide spectrum of observational evidence is the idea of [[combustion]] inside the low-velocity region of spherical [[vortex]] breakdown of a natural vortex{{vague|date=July 2012}} (e.g., the '[[Hill's spherical vortex]]').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Coleman | first = PF | year = 1993 | journal = Weather | volume = 48 | issue = 1 | page = 30 | title = An explanation for ball lightning? | doi = 10.1002/j.1477-8696.1993.tb07221.x|bibcode = 1993Wthr...48...27. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nanobattery hypothesis ===
Oleg Meshcheryakov suggests that ball lightning is made of composite nano or submicrometre particles—each particle constituting a [[Battery (electrical)|battery]]. A surface discharge shorts these batteries, causing a current that forms the ball. His model is described as an [[aerosol]] model that explains all the observable properties and processes of ball lightning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meshcheryakov|first=Oleg |year= 2007|title=Ball Lightning–Aerosol Electrochemical Power Source or A Cloud of Batteries|journal=Nanoscale Res.

=== Black hole hypothesis ===
Another hypothesis is that some ball lightning is the passage of microscopic [[primordial black hole]]s through the Earth's atmosphere. This possibility was mentioned parenthetically by Leo Vuyk in 1992 in [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=NL&amp;NR=9200267A&amp;KC=A&amp;FT=D&amp;ND=4&amp;date=19930901&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP a patent application] and a [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=nl_NL&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19970912&amp;CC=NL&amp;NR=1002570C1&amp;KC=C1 second patent application] in 1996 by Leendert Vuyk. The first detailed scientific analysis was published by Mario Rabinowitz in [[Astrophysics and Space Science]] journal in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Little Black Holes: Dark Matter and Ball Lightning  |pages=391–410 |date=11 December 2002 |issue=4 |volume=262 |author1=Mario Rabinowitz |doi=10.1023/A:1001865715833 |journal=Astrophys. Space Sci. |arxiv=astro-ph/0212251|bibcode = 1998Ap&amp;SS.262..391R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buoyant plasma hypothesis ===
The declassified [[Project Condign]] report concludes that buoyant charged [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] formations similar to ball lightning are formed by novel physical, electrical, and magnetic phenomena, and that these charged plasmas are capable of being transported at enormous speeds under the influence and balance of electrical charges in the atmosphere. These plasmas appear to originate due to more than one set of weather and electrically charged conditions, the scientific rationale for which is incomplete or not fully understood. One suggestion is that meteors breaking up in the atmosphere and forming charged plasmas as opposed to burning completely or impacting as meteorites could explain some instances of the phenomena, in addition to other unknown atmospheric events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.disclosureproject.org/docs/pdf/uap_exec_summary_dec00.pdf | UAP in the UK Air Defence Region, Executive Summary, Page 7, Defence Intelligence Staff, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transcranial magnetic stimulation ===
Cooray and Cooray (2008)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.el.angstrom.uu.se/meny/artiklar/ball%20lightning.pdf Could some ball lightning observations be optical hallucinations caused by epileptic seizures], Cooray, G. and V. Cooray, ''The open access atmospheric science journal'', vol. 2, pp. 101–105 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the features of hallucinations experienced by patients having [[epileptic seizure]]s in the [[occipital lobe]] are similar to the observed features of ball lightning. The study also showed that the rapidly changing magnetic field of a close lightning flash is strong enough to excite the neurons in the brain. This strengthens the possibility of lightning-induced seizure in the occipital lobe of a person close to a lightning strike, establishing the connection between epileptic [[hallucination]] mimicking ball lightning and thunderstorms.

More recent research with [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] has been shown to give the same hallucination results in the laboratory (termed [[magnetophosphene]]s), and these conditions have been shown to occur in nature near lightning strikes.&lt;ref name="Peer 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Peer, J. |author2=Kendl, A. |doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2010.05.023 |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=374 |title=Transcranial stimulability of phosphenes by long lightning electromagnetic pulses |issue=29 |pages=2932–2935 |year=2010 |arxiv=1005.1153|bibcode = 2010PhLA..374.2932P}}

This hypothesis fails to explain observed physical damage caused by ball lightning or simultaneous observation by multiple witnesses. (At the very least, observations would differ substantially.){{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Theoretical calculations from [[University of Innsbruck]] researchers suggest that the magnetic fields involved in certain types of lightning strikes could potentially induce visual hallucinations resembling ball lightning.&lt;ref name="Peer 2010" /&gt;  Such fields, which are found within close distances to a point in which multiple lightning strikes have occurred over a few seconds, can directly cause the [[neurons]] in the [[visual cortex]] to fire, resulting in [[magnetophosphene]]s (magnetically induced visual hallucinations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Emerging Technology  |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/25166/ |title=Magnetically Induced Hallucinations Explain Ball Lightning, Say Physicists – Technology Review |publisher=Technologyreview.com |date=2010-05-11 |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spinning plasma toroid (ring) ===
Seward proposes that ball lightning is a spinning plasma toroid or ring.  He built a lab that produces lightning level arcs, and by modifying the conditions he produced bright, small balls that mimic ball lightning and persist in atmosphere after the arc ends.  Using a high speed camera he was able to show that the bright balls were spinning plasma toroids.&lt;ref&gt;Seward, C., Chen, C., Ware, K. "Ball Lightning Explained as a Stable Plasma Toroid."  PPPS- 2001 Pulsed Power Plasma Science Conference.  June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chen was able to derive the physics and found that there is a class of plasma toroids that remain stable with or without an external magnetic containment, a new plasma configuration unlike anything reported elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, C., Pakter, R., Seward, D. C. "Equilibrium and Stability Properties of Self-Organized Electron Spiral Toroids." Physics of Plasmas.  Vol. 8, No. 10, pp.&amp;nbsp;4441–4449. October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seward published images of the results of his experiments, along with his method.  Included is a report by a farmer of observing a ball lightning event forming in a kitchen and the effects it caused as it moved around the kitchen.  This is the only eye witness account of ball lightning forming, then staying in one area, then ending that the author has heard of.&lt;ref&gt;Seward, Clint.  "Ball Lightning Explanation Leading to Clean Energy." Amazon.com. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rydberg matter concept ===
Manykin et al. have suggested atmospheric [[Rydberg matter]] as an explanation of ball lightning phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Manykin | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Ojovan | first2 = M. I. | last3 = Poluektov | first3 = P.

This condensed excited state of matter is supported by experiments, mainly of a group led by Holmlid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holmlid | first1 = L. | title = Direct observation of circular Rydberg electrons in a Rydberg matter surface layer by electronic circular dichroism | doi = 10.1088/0953-8984/19/27/276206 | journal = Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter | volume = 19 | issue = 27 | page = 276206| year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2007JPCM...19A6206H }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to a liquid or solid state of matter with extremely low (gas-like) density. Lumps of atmospheric Rydberg matter can result from condensation of highly excited atoms that form by atmospheric electrical phenomena, mainly due to linear lightning. Stimulated decay of Rydberg matter clouds can, however, take the form of an avalanche, and so appear as an explosion.

=== Vacuum hypothesis ===
{{Over-quotation|section|date=December 2017}}
Nikola Tesla's (1899 December) theorized that the balls were formed inside a gas that was highly rarefied.&lt;ref name="Tesla, Nikola 1978"/&gt;

&lt;u&gt;On the formation&lt;/u&gt;
"A single powerful streamer, breaking out from a well insulated terminal, may easily convey a current of several hundred amperes! No wonder then, that a small mass of air is exploded with an effect similar to that of a bombshell..."
"..let us now assume that such a powerful streamer or spark discharge, in its passage through the air, happens to come upon a vacuous sphere or space formed in the manner described. This space, containing gas highly rarefied, may be just in the act of contracting, at any rate, the intense current, passing through the rarefied gas suddenly raises the same to an extremely high temperature, all the higher as the mass of the gas is very small.
But although the gas may have been brought to vivid incandescence, yet its pressure may not be very great. If, upon the sudden passage of the discharge, the pressure of the heated air exceeds that of the air around, the luminous ball or space will expand, but most generally it may not do so. For assume, for instance, that the air in the vacuous space was at one hundredth say, of its normal pressure, which might well be the case, then, since the pressure in the space would be as the absolute temperature of the gas within, it would require a temperature which seems scarcely realizable, to raise the pressure of the rarefied gas to the normal air pressure."But how is it when the second discharge and possibly many subsequent ones pass through the rarefied gas? These discharges find the gas already expanded and in a condition to take up much more energy by reason of the properties it acquires through rarefaction. Evidently, the energy consumption in any given part of the path of the streamer or spark discharge is, under otherwise the same conditions, proportionate to the resistance of that part of the path; and since, after the gas has once broken down, the resistance of other parts of the path of the discharge is much smaller than that including the vacuous space, a comparatively very great energy consumption must necessarily take place in this portion of the current path."

&lt;u&gt;On the duration&lt;/u&gt; 
"Here, then, is a mass of gas heated to high incandescence suddenly but not, as before, in a condition to give up heat rapidly. It can not cool down rapidly by expansion, as when the vacuous space was being formed, nor can it give off much heat by convection. To some extent even radiation is diminished. On the contrary, despite the high temperature, it is compelled to confinement in a limited space which is continuously shrinking instead of expanding. All these causes cooperate in maintaining, for a comparatively long period of time, the gas confined in this space at an elevated temperature, in a state of high incandescence, in the case under consideration. Thus it is that the phenomenon of the ball is produced and the same made to persist for a perceptible fraction or interval of time."

&lt;u&gt;On the movement&lt;/u&gt; 
"As might be expected, the incandescent mass of gas in a medium violently agitated, could not possibly remain in the same place but will be, as a rule, carried, in some direction or other, by the currents of the air. Upon little reflection, however, we are led to the conclusion that the ball or incandescent mass, of whatever shape it be, will always move from the place where an explosion occurred first, to some place where such an explosion occurred later. In fact, all observers concur in the opinion that such a fireball moves slowly."

&lt;u&gt;On the explosion&lt;/u&gt; 
"If we interpret the nature of this wonderful phenomenon in this manner, we shall find it quite natural that when such a ball encounters in its course an object, as a piece of organic matter for instance, it will raise the same to a high temperature, thus liberating suddenly a great quantity of gas by evaporating or volatilizing the substance with the result of being itself dissipated or exploded. Obviously, also, it may be expected that the conducting mass of the ball originated as described, and moving through a highly insulating medium, will be likely to be highly electrified, which accords with many of the observations made."

=== Other hypotheses ===
Several other hypotheses have been proposed to explain ball lightning:
* Spinning electric [[dipole]] hypothesis. A 1976 article by V. G. Endean postulated that ball lightning could be described as an [[electric field]] vector spinning in the [[microwave]] frequency region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Endean | first1 = V. G. | title = Ball lightning as electromagnetic energy | doi = 10.1038/263753a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 263 | issue = 5580 | pages = 753–755 | year = 1976 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1976Natur.263..753E }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Electrostatic]] Leyden jar models.  Stanley Singer discussed (1971) this type of hypothesis and suggested that the electrical recombination time would be too short for the ball lightning lifetimes often reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Stanley|title=The Nature of Ball Lightning|location=New York|publisher=Plenum Press|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Smirnov proposed (1987) a [[fractal]] [[aerogel]] hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Smirnov 1987, ''Physics Reports'', (Review Section of ''Physical Letters''), 152, No. 4, pp. 177–226.&lt;/ref&gt;
* V.P. Torchigin proposed (2003) considering ball lightning as a form of self-confined intense light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=V.P.|last=Torchigin|year=2009|title=Ball Lightning as an Optical Incoherent Space Spherical Soliton in Handbook of Solitons: Research, Technology and Applications editors S.P. Lang and S.H. Bedore |publisher=Novapublishers |location=New York|pages=3–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mikhail Zelikin|M.I. Zelikin]] proposed (2006) an explanation (with a rigorous mathematical foundation) based on the hypothesis of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[superconductivity]]&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zelikin | first1 = M. I. | title = Superconductivity of plasma and fireballs | doi = 10.1007/s10958-008-9047-x | journal = Journal of Mathematical Sciences | volume = 151 | issue = 6 | pages = 3473–3496 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;).
* H.C. Wu proposed (2016) that ball lightning arises when a "relativistic electron bunch" forming at the tip of a lightning stroke excites "intense microwave radiation" under certain conditions. As the microwaves ionize the surrounding air, their associated pressure may then evacuate the resulting plasma to form a bubble that "stably traps the radiation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep28263|title=Relativistic-microwave theory of ball lightning|publisher=Scientific Reports|accessdate=22 June 2016|last1 = Wu| first1 = H.-C. | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fort «Furggels» - Battery Power Supply (5166616214).jpg|thumb|Battery room]]

A '''battery room''' is a room in a facility used to house [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] for backup or uninterruptible power systems. Battery rooms are found in [[telecommunication]] [[Telephone exchange|central offices]], and to provide standby power to computing equipment in [[datacenter]]s. Batteries provide [[direct current]] (DC) electricity, which may be used directly by some types of equipment, or which may be converted to [[alternating current]] (AC) by [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS) equipment. The batteries may provide power for minutes, hours or days depending on the electrical system design, although most commonly the batteries power the UPS during brief electric utility outages lasting only seconds.  

Battery rooms were used to segregate the fumes and corrosive chemicals of [[wet cell]] batteries (often [[Lead–acid battery|lead–acid]]) from the operating equipment; a separate room also allowed better control of temperature and ventilation for the batteries.  In 1890 the [[Western Union]] central [[Western Union Telegraph Building (New York)|telegraph office in New York City]] had 20,000 wet cells, mostly primary zinc-copper type, in use.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=N-pQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA425&amp;dq=%22battery+room%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9jZATurFMMOs8QOxn8HHBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22battery%20room%22&amp;f=false ''The Electrical Engineer'', October 25, 1890 page 425&lt;/ref&gt;

== Telecommunications ==
Telephone system central offices contain large battery systems to provide power for customer telephones, telephone switches, and related apparatus.&lt;ref name=NFPA18/&gt; Terrestrial microwave links, cellular telephone sites, fibre optic apparatus and satellite communications facilities also have standby battery systems, which may be large enough to occupy a separate room in the building. In normal operation power from the local commercial utility operates telecommunication equipment, and batteries provide power if the normal supply is interrupted. These can be sized for the expected full duration of an interruption, or may be required only to provide power while a standby generator set or other emergency power supply is started. 

Batteries often used in battery rooms are the flooded [[lead-acid battery]], the [[VRLA battery|valve regulated lead-acid battery]] or the [[nickel–cadmium battery]]. Batteries are installed in groups. Several batteries are wired together in a series circuit forming a group providing DC electric power at 12, 24, 48 or 60 volts (or higher). Usually there are two or more groups of series-connected batteries. These groups of batteries are connected in a parallel circuit. This arrangement allows an individual group of batteries to be taken offline for service or replacement without compromising the availability of uninterruptible power. Generally, the larger the battery room's electrical capacity, the larger the size of each individual battery and the higher the room's DC voltage.

==Electrical utilities==
Battery rooms are also found in electric [[power plant]]s and [[Electrical substation|substation]]s where reliable power is required for operation of [[switchgear]], critical standby systems, and possibly [[black start]] of the station. &lt;ref name=BH06&gt;Colin Bayliss, Brian Hardy ''Transmission and Distribution Electrical Engineering'' Elsevier, 2006, {{ISBN|0080468136}} pp. 121-124 &lt;/ref&gt;  Often batteries for large switchgear line-ups are 125 V or 250 V nominal systems, and feature redundant battery chargers with independent power sources. Separate battery rooms may be provided to protect against loss of the station due to a fire in a battery bank. For stations that are capable of black start, power from the battery system may be required for many purposes including switchgear operations.

Very large utility batteries may be used for [[grid energy storage]].

Battery rooms are found on diesel-electric [[submarine]]s, where they contain the lead-acid batteries used for undersea propulsion of the vessel. Even nuclear submarines contain large battery rooms as backups to provide maneuvering power if the nuclear reactor is shutdown. Batteries in surface vessels may also be contained in a battery room.

Battery rooms on ocean-going vessels must prevent seawater from contacting battery acid, as this could produce toxic chlorine gas.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Friedman ''U.S. Submarines Through 1945: An Illustrated Design History'', Naval Institute Press, 1995 {{ISBN|1557502633}},  p. 361&lt;/ref&gt;
This is of particular concern on submarines.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (U.S.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=eUcWSXV02YQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Review+of+Submarine+Escape+Action+Levels+for+Selected+Chemicals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HYHwYkPcK1&amp;sig=o0OfXbu5E-c9DMjPV4CeGnZZpGw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=t6tYUNzoEIvh0wGq34DgCg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Review of Submarine Escape Action Levels for Selected Chemicals]'', National Academies Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0309082943}},  page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design issues ==
Since several types of [[Secondary battery|secondary batteries]] give off [[hydrogen]] if overcharged, ventilation of a battery room is critical to maintain the concentration below the lower [[explosive limit]]. The number of air changes per hour required to prevent unsafe accumulation can be calculated from the number of cells and the charging current, given the chemistry of the battery. &lt;ref name=BH06/&gt;

The life span of secondary batteries is reduced at high temperature and the energy storage capacity is reduced at low temperature, so a battery room must have heating or cooling to maintain the proper temperature.

Batteries may contain large quantities of corrosive [[electrolyte]]s such as [[sulfuric acid]] used in lead-acid batteries or caustic potash (aka [[potassium hydroxide]]) used in [[Nickel-cadmium battery|NiCad batteries]]. Materials of the battery room must resist corrosion and contain any accidental spills. Plant personnel must be protected from spilled electrolyte.  In some jurisdictions, large battery systems may contain reportable amounts of sulfuric acid, a concern for fire departments.&lt;ref name=NFPA18&gt;[[National Fire Protection Association]], ''Fire Protection Handbook Eighteenth Edition'', NFPA 1997 {{ISBN|0-87765-377-1}} ;pp. 9-199 9-203&lt;/ref&gt;  Battery rooms in industrial and utility installations typically have an eye-wash station or decontamination showers nearby, so that workers who are accidentally splashed with electrolyte can immediately wash it away from the eyes and skin.

Blowing snow can come from falling snow or snow that already accumulated on the ground but is picked up and blown about by strong winds. It is one of the classic requirements for a blizzard. Its [[METAR]] code is BLSN. If the snow remains below 8 feet (2 m), it will be called '''Drifting snow''' (METAR code DRSN). The snow which is being blown about may deposit as [[snowdrift]]s.

==Formation==
[[Image:Blizzard1 - NOAA.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Visibility]] reduced in blowing snow during a ground blizzard]]

There are 3 ways of producing blowing snow:
# In [[horizontal advection]] conditions, the winds blow across the surface of the earth with very little if any large-scale upward motion.
# In [[convection]] conditions, the winds exhibit large-scale upward motion lifting the snow into the atmosphere creating drifting waves of snow up to 500 metres in height.
# In [[thermal-mechanical]] mixing conditions, massive convective rolls form in the atmosphere and the blizzard may be observed from space with the blizzards convective rolls creating waves of snow (also known as snow billows)&lt;ref name="CIMSS"&gt;{{Cite web

In [[aeronautics]] and [[aeronautical engineering]], '''camber''' is the asymmetry between the two acting surfaces of an [[aerofoil]], with the top surface of a wing (or correspondingly the front surface of a propeller blade) commonly being more convex (''positive camber'').  An aerofoil that is not cambered is called a ''symmetric aerofoil''. The benefits of cambering were discovered and first utilized by [[Sir George Cayley]] in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| quote       = Experiments that he began to carry out in 1804 allowed him to learn more about aerodynamics and wing structures using a whirling arm device. Cayley observed that birds soared long distances by simply twisting their arched wing surfaces and deduced that fixed-wing machines would fly if the wings were cambered. This was the first scientific testing of aerofoils as the part of the aircraft that is designed to produce lift.

==Overview==
Camber is usually designed into an [[aerofoil]] to increase the maximum [[lift coefficient]].  This minimizes the [[Stall (flight)|stalling]] speed of aircraft using the aerofoil.  An aircraft with wings based on a cambered aerofoil will have a lower stalling speed than an aircraft with a similar [[wing loading]] and wings based on a symmetric aerofoil.

An aircraft designer may also reduce the camber of the outboard section of the wings to increase the critical angle of attack (stall angle) at the wing tips. When the wing approaches the stall this will ensure that the wing root stalls before the tip, giving the aircraft resistance to [[spin (flight)|spinning]] and maintaining aileron effectiveness close to the stall.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Some recent designs use negative camber. One such design is called the [[supercritical aerofoil]]. It is used for near-supersonic flight, and produces a higher [[lift-to-drag ratio]] at near [[supersonic flight]] than traditional aerofoils. Supercritical aerofoils employ a flattened upper surface, highly cambered (curved) aft section, and greater leading-edge radius as compared to traditional aerofoil shapes. These changes delay the onset of [[wave drag]].

==Definition==
Broadly, an aerofoil is said to have positive camber if, as is commonly the case, its upper surface (or in the case of a propeller or turbine blade its forward surface) is the more convex. But camber is a complex property, that can be more fully characterized by an aerofoil's '''camber line''', the curve ''Z(x)'' that is halfway between the upper and lower surfaces, and '''thickness function''' ''T(x)'', which describes the thickness of the aerofoil at any given point. Then, the upper and lower surfaces can be defined as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;
Z_\text{upper}(x)=Z(x)+\frac{1}{2}T(x)
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
Z_\text{lower}(x)=Z(x)-\frac{1}{2}T(x)
&lt;/math&gt;

===Example – An aerofoil with reflexed camber line===
[[File:Reflex camber line.jpg|thumb|right|351px|An aerofoil with reflex camber.]]
An aerofoil where the camber line curves back up near the trailing edge is called a reflexed camber aerofoil. Such an aerofoil is useful in certain situations, such as with [[tailless aircraft]], because the [[moment (physics)|moment]] about the [[aerodynamic center]] of the aerofoil can be 0. A camber line for such an aerofoil can be defined as follows (''note that the lines over the variables indicates that they have been [[Nondimensionalization|nondimensionalized]] by dividing through by the chord''):

: &lt;math&gt;
\overline{Z}(x) = a\left[\left(b-1\right){\overline{x}}^3-b{\overline{x}}^2+\overline{x}\right]
&lt;/math&gt;

An aerofoil with a reflexed camber line is shown at right. The thickness distribution for a [[NACA airfoil|NACA 4-series aerofoil]] was used, with a 12% thickness ratio. The equation for this thickness distribution is:

: &lt;math&gt;
\overline{T}(x) = \frac{t}{0.2}\left(0.2969\sqrt{\overline{x}}-0.1260\overline{x}-0.3516{\overline{x}}^2+0.2843{\overline{x}}^3-0.1015{\overline{x}}^4\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Where ''t'' is the thickness ratio.

The '''Chernobyl disaster''', also referred to as the '''Chernobyl accident''', was a [[Catastrophic failure|catastrophic]] [[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|nuclear accident]]. It occurred on 25–26 April 1986 in the No. 4 [[RBMK|light water graphite moderated reactor]] at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] near the now-abandoned town of [[Pripyat]], in northern [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], [[Soviet Union]], approximately {{convert|104|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/story/nuclear-exclusion-zones |title=Nuclear Exclusion Zones|work=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=15 January 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event occurred during a late-night safety test which simulated a [[power blackout|station blackout]] power-failure, in the course of which [[control rod|safety systems]] were intentionally turned off. A combination of inherent [[RBMK|reactor design flaws]] and the reactor operators [[Iodine pit|arranging the core]] in a manner contrary to the [[checklist]] for the test, eventually resulted in [[Criticality accident|uncontrolled reaction conditions]]. Water flashed into steam generating a destructive [[steam explosion]] and a subsequent open-air [[nuclear graphite|graphite]] fire.{{refn|group=note|name=external|Although most reports on the Chernobyl accident refer to a number of graphite fires, it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned. According to the [[General Atomics]] website:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gt-mhr.ga.com/safety.php |title=Graphites |website=General Atomics |accessdate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717102758/http://gt-mhr.ga.com/safety.php |archivedate=17 July 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of [[charcoal]] and [[coal]]. Numerous tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn high-purity, nuclear-grade graphites." On Chernobyl, the same source states: "Graphite played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident. The red glow observed during the Chernobyl accident was the expected color of [[black-body radiation|luminescence]] for graphite at 700°C and not a large-scale graphite fire, as some have incorrectly assumed." Similarly, nuclear physicist Yevgeny Velikhov,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4918742.stm |title=The Chernobyl nightmare revisited |last=Mulvey |first=Stephen |date=18 April 2006 |website=BBC News |access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted some 2 weeks after the accident, "Until now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist: A great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an [[incandescent]] state" That is, all the nuclear-[[decay heat]] that was generated inside the uranium fuel ([[Loss-of-coolant accident|heat which would normally be extracted by back-up coolant pumps, in an undamaged reactor]]) was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it, to glow [[incandescent|red-hot]]. This is contrary to the oft cited interpretation, which is that the graphite was red-hot chiefly because it was chemically [[oxidizing]] with the air.}} This fire produced considerable [[updraft]]s for about nine days. These lofted [[plume (fluid dynamics)|plumes]] of [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]] into the atmosphere. The estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot fire phase approximately equaled in magnitude the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion.&lt;ref name="OECD02-Ch2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/reports/2003/nea3508-chernobyl.pdf |title=Chernobyl: Assessment of Radiological and Health Impact, 2002 update; Chapter II – The release, dispersion and deposition of radionuclides |year=2002 |publisher=OECD-NEA |accessdate= 3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This radioactive material [[nuclear fallout|precipitated]] onto parts of the western USSR and Europe.

During the accident, steam-blast effects caused [[Deaths due to the Chernobyl disaster|two deaths]] within the facility: one immediately after the explosion, and the other compounded by a [[lethal dose of radiation]].

The Chernobyl accident is considered the most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history, both in terms of cost and casualties.

The remains of the No. 4 reactor building were enclosed in a large [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus|cover]] which was named the "Object Shelter", often known as the sarcophagus. The purpose of the structure was to reduce the spread of the remaining [[Radioactive contamination|radioactive dust and debris]] from the wreckage and the protection of the wreckage from further weathering.
The sarcophagus was finished in December 1986 at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the [[Shutdown (nuclear reactor)|cold shut-down]] phase.
The enclosure was not intended as a [[radiation shield]], but was built quickly as [[occupational safety]] for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station, with No. 3 continuing to produce electricity up into 2000.&lt;ref name="GalleryTimeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chernobylgallery.com/chernobyl-disaster/timeline/ |title=Timeline: A chronology of events surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear disaster |website=The Chernobyl Gallery |access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chornobyl.in.ua"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chornobyl.in.ua/en/shelter.htm |title="Shelter" object |website=Chernobyl, Pripyat, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the exclusion zone |accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disaster began during a systems test on 26 April 1986 at reactor 4 of the Chernobyl plant near [[Pripyat]] and in proximity to the administrative border with [[Belarusian SSR|Belarus]] and the [[Dnieper]] River. There was a sudden and unexpected power surge. When operators attempted an emergency shutdown, a much larger spike in power output occurred. This second spike led to a [[reactor vessel]] rupture and a series of steam explosions. These events exposed the [[graphite]] [[neutron moderator|moderator]] of the reactor to air, causing it to ignite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/features/chernobyl-15/cherno-faq.shtml |title=Frequently Asked Chernobyl Questions |date=May 2005 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |website=International Atomic Energy Agency – Division of Public Information |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223010003/http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/features/chernobyl-15/cherno-faq.shtml |archivedate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{discuss}} For the next week, the resulting fire sent long plumes of highly radioactive [[fallout]] into the atmosphere over an extensive geographical area, including Pripyat. The plumes drifted over large parts of the western [[Soviet Union]] and Europe. According to official post-Soviet data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chernobyl.info/en-US/Home/History-of-Chernobyl-Disaster/The-Accident.aspx |title=Preface: The Chernobyl Accident |website=International Chernobyl Research and Information Network (ICRIN) |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IAEA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental consequences of the Chernobyl accident and their remediation: Twenty years of experience.

Thirty-six hours after the accident, Soviet officials enacted a 10-kilometre [[exclusion zone]], which resulted in the rapid evacuation of 49,000 people primarily from Pripyat, the nearest large population centre.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Disasters pp 55"&gt;{{cite book |title=Nuclear Disasters &amp; The Built Environment: A Report to the Royal Institute |last1=Steadman |first1=Philip |last2=Hodgkinson |first2=Simon |date=1990 |publisher=Butterworth Architecture |isbn=978-0-40850-061-6 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not communicated at the time, an immediate evacuation of the town following the accident was not advisable as the road leading out of the town had heavy [[nuclear fallout]] hotspots deposited on it. Initially, the town itself was comparatively safe due to the favourable wind direction. Until the winds began to change direction, [[shelter in place]] was considered the best safety measure for the town.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Disasters pp 55"/&gt;

During the accident the wind changed direction; the fact that the different plumes from the reactor had different ratios of radioisotopes in them indicates that the relative release rates of different elements from the accident site was changing.&lt;ref name=Foreman2015&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/23312009.2015.1049111 |title=An introduction to serious nuclear accident chemistry |journal=Cogent Chemistry |volume=1 |year=2015 |last1=Foreman |first1=Mark Russell St. John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As plumes and subsequent fallout continued to be generated, the [[exclusion zone|evacuation zone]] was increased from 10 to 30&amp;nbsp;km about one week after the accident.

In 2017 Philip Thomas, Professor of Risk Management at the [[University of Bristol]], used the [[years of potential life lost]] metric to conclude that "Relocation was unjustified for 75% of the 335,000 people relocated after Chernobyl", finding that just 900 people among the 220,000 relocated during the second evacuation would have lost 3 months of life expectancy by staying home and that "none should have been asked to leave". For comparison, Thomas found that the average resident of [[London]], a city of ~8 million, loses 4.5 months of life due to air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171120085453.htm |title=Homes should not be abandoned after a big nuclear accident, study suggests |date=20 November 2017 |website=[[Science Daily]] |access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=P.J |title=J-value assessment of relocation measures following the nuclear power plant accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi |journal=Process Safety and Environmental Protection |volume=112 |pages=16–49 |date=November 2017 |doi=10.1016/j.psep.2017.03.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident==

On 26 April 1986, at 01:23 ([[Moscow Time|UTC+3]]), reactor four suffered a catastrophic power increase, leading to explosions in its core. As the reactor had not been encased by any kind of hard [[containment building|containment vessel]], this dispersed large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Medvedev |first=Zhores A. |authorlink=Zhores A.

The accident occurred during an experiment scheduled to test the viability of a potential safety [[Nuclear safety systems#Emergency core cooling system|emergency core cooling]] feature, which required a normal reactor shutdown procedure.

In steady state operation, a significant fraction (over 6%) of the power from a nuclear reactor is derived not from fission but from the [[decay heat]] of its accumulated fission products. This heat continues for some time after the [[chain reaction]] is stopped (e.g., following an emergency [[SCRAM]]) and active cooling may be required to prevent [[nuclear meltdown|core damage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ewp.rpi.edu/hartford/~ernesto/F2011/EP/MaterialsforStudents/Petty/Ragheb-Ch8-2011.PDF |title=Decay Heat Generation in Fission Reactors |first=M. |last=Ragheb |website=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |date=22 March 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RBMK]] reactors like those at Chernobyl use water as a coolant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=DOE Fundamentals Handbook&amp;nbsp;– Nuclear physics and reactor theory |volume=1 of 2, module 1 |page=61 |publisher=United States Department of Energy |date=January 1996 |url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/06/f2/h1019v1.pdf#page=85.5 |accessdate=3 June 2010 |agency=DOE–HDBK-1019/1-93 / Available to the public from the National Technical Information Services, U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal, Springfield, VA 22161. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319145623/http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/06/f2/h1019v1.pdf#page=85.5 |archivedate=19 March 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Standard Review Plan for the Review of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants: LWR Edition (NUREG-0800) |website=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission |date=May 2010 |url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr0800/ |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactor 4 at Chernobyl consisted of about 1,600 individual fuel channels, each of which required coolant flow of 28 metric tons ({{convert|28000|l|gal|disp=or}}) per hour.&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"/&gt;

Since cooling pumps require electricity to cool a reactor after a SCRAM, in the event of a power grid failure, Chernobyl's reactors had three backup [[diesel generator]]s; these could start up in 15 seconds, but took 60–75 seconds&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"/&gt;{{rp|15}} to attain full speed and reach the 5.5{{nbhyph}}[[megawatt]] (MW) output required to run one main pump.&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"/&gt;{{rp|30}}

To solve this one-minute gap{{snd}}considered an unacceptable safety risk{{snd}}it had been theorized that [[rotational energy]] from the [[steam turbine]] (as it wound down under residual steam pressure) could be used to generate the required electrical power. Analysis indicated that this residual momentum and steam pressure might be sufficient to run the coolant pumps for 45 seconds,&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"/&gt;{{rp|16}} bridging the gap between an external power failure and the full availability of the emergency generators.&lt;ref name="NV Karpan: 312–13"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Karpan|2006|pp=312–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This capability still needed to be confirmed experimentally, and previous tests had ended unsuccessfully. An initial test carried out in 1982 indicated that the [[excitation (magnetic)|excitation]] voltage of the turbine-generator was insufficient; it did not maintain the desired [[magnetic field]] after the turbine trip. The system was modified, and the test was repeated in 1984 but again proved unsuccessful. In 1985, the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results. The test procedure would be repeated in 1986, and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of Reactor Four.&lt;ref name="NV Karpan: 312–13"/&gt;

The test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor. The test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown. No detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated, so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor (NIKIET) or the scientific manager. Instead, it was approved only by the director of the plant (and even this approval was not consistent with established procedures).&lt;ref name=insag7/&gt;

According to the test parameters, the thermal output of the reactor should have been ''no lower'' than 700&amp;nbsp;MW at the start of the experiment. If test conditions had been as planned, the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely; the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started, which was inconsistent with approved procedure.&lt;ref name=insag7/&gt;

The Chernobyl power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first 60–75 seconds of a total loss of electric power, and thus lacked an important safety feature. The station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity, which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose, and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the Soviet nuclear oversight regulator (even though there was a representative at the complex of four reactors).&lt;ref name="Medvedev Z" group= notes&gt;"The mere fact that the operators were carrying out an experiment that had not been approved by higher officials indicates that something was wrong with the chain of command. The State Committee on Safety in the Atomic Power Industry is permanently represented at the Chernobyl station. Yet the engineers and experts in that office were not informed about the program. In part, the tragedy was the product of administrative anarchy or the attempt to keep everything secret." – Medvedev, Z., (1990) pp. 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The experimental procedure was intended to run as follows:
# The reactor was to be running at a low power level, between 700 MW and 800 MW.
# The steam-turbine generator was to be run up to full speed.
# When these conditions were achieved, the steam supply for the turbine generator was to be closed off.
# Turbine generator performance was to be recorded to determine whether it could provide the bridging power for coolant pumps until the emergency diesel generators were sequenced to start and provide power to the cooling pumps automatically.
# After the emergency generators reached normal operating speed and voltage, the turbine generator would be allowed to continue to freewheel down.

===Conditions before the accident===

The conditions to run the test were established before the day shift of 25 April 1986. The day-shift workers had been instructed in advance and were familiar with the established procedures. A special team of [[electrical engineer]]s was present to test the new voltage regulating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Dyatlov|2003|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As planned, a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at 01:06 on 25 April, and the power level had reached 50% of its nominal 3200&amp;nbsp;MW thermal level by the beginning of the day shift.

[[File:RBMK en.svg|thumb|400px|right|A schematic diagram of the reactor]]

At this point, another regional power station unexpectedly went offline, and the [[Kiev]] [[electrical grid]] controller requested that the further reduction of Chernobyl's output be postponed, as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand. The Chernobyl plant director agreed, and postponed the test. Despite this delay, preparations for the test not affecting the reactor's power were carried out, including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or ECCS, a passive/active system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a [[loss-of-coolant accident]]. Given the other events that unfolded, the system would have been of limited use, but its disabling as a "routine" step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test.&lt;ref name="OECD02-Ch1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/reports/2003/nea3508-chernobyl.pdf |title=Chernobyl: Assessment of Radiological and Health Impact, 2002 update; Chapter I – The site and accident sequence |website=OECD-NEA |year=2002 |accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned, it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test.

At 23:04, the Kiev grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume. This delay had some serious consequences: the day shift had long since departed, the evening shift was also preparing to leave, and the night shift would not take over until midnight, well into the job. According to plan, the test should have been finished during the day shift, and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise shut-down plant.&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"/&gt;{{rp|36–38}}

The night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment. A further rapid decrease in the power level from 50% was executed during the shift change-over. [[Alexander Akimov]] was chief of the night shift, and Leonid Toptunov was the operator responsible for the reactor's operational regimen, including the movement of the [[control rod]]s. Toptunov was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months.&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"/&gt;{{rp|36–38}}

The test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor 4 to a thermal level of 700–1000&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://rrc2.narod.ru/book/app7.html |title=Рабочая Программа: Испытаний Турбогенератора № 8 Чернобыльской Аэс В Режимах Совместного Выбега С Нагрузкой Собственных Нужд |trans-title=Work Program: Tests of the Turbogenerator No. 8 of the Chernobyl AESP in Run-Off Modes With the Load of Own Needs |website=rrc2.narod.ru |language=ru |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An output of 700&amp;nbsp;MW was reached at 00:05 on 26 April. Due to the reactor's production of a fission byproduct, [[xenon-135]], which is a reaction-inhibiting [[neutron absorber]], core power continued to decrease without further operator action—a process known as [[Iodine pit|reactor poisoning]]. This continuing decrease in power occurred because in ''steady state operation'', xenon-135 is "burned off" as quickly as it is created from decaying [[Isotopes of iodine#Iodine-135 and nuclear reactor control|iodine-135]] by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable [[xenon-136]]. When the reactor power was lowered, previously produced high quantities of iodine-135 decayed into the neutron-absorbing xenon-135 faster than the reduced [[neutron flux]] could burn it off. As the reactor power output dropped further, to approximately 500&amp;nbsp;MW, Toptunov mistakenly inserted the control rods too far—the exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because Akimov died in hospital on 10 May and Toptunov on 14 May. This combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended near-[[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shutdown]] state, with a power output of 30&amp;nbsp;MW thermal or less.

The reactor was now producing 5&amp;nbsp;percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test.&lt;ref name=insag7/&gt;{{rp|73}} Control-room personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Dyatlov|2003|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at 160–200&amp;nbsp;MW (thermal), a much smaller value than the planned 700&amp;nbsp;MW. The rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown, and the subsequent operation at a level of less than 200&amp;nbsp;MW led to increased poisoning of the [[reactor core]] by the accumulation of xenon-135.&lt;ref name="nf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nuclearfissionary.com/2010/03/03/what-happened-at-chernobyl/ |title=What Happened at Chernobyl? |accessdate=12 January 2011 |website=Nuclear Fissionary |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714210818/http://nuclearfissionary.com/2010/03/03/what-happened-at-chernobyl/ |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The accumulation of Xe-135 in the core is burned out by neutrons. Higher power settings bring higher neutron flux and burn the xenon out more quickly. Conversely, low power settings result in the accumulation of xenon.&lt;/ref&gt; This restricted any further rise of reactor power, and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning.

The operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow, and possibly by instability of neutron flux, which triggered alarms. The control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the steam/water separator drums, and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water, as well as from [[relief valve]]s opened to relieve excess steam into a [[condenser (heat transfer)|turbine condenser]], and from the neutron power controller. Between 00:35 and 00:45, emergency alarm signals concerning [[thermal-hydraulic]] parameters were ignored, apparently to preserve the reactor power level.&lt;ref name="atom"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://accidont.ru/expert.html |title=Report for the IAEA on the Chernobyl Accident |journal=Atomic Energy |volume=61 |date=1986 |pages=308–320 |language=ru |publisher=IAEA |access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the power level of 200&amp;nbsp;MW was achieved, preparation for the experiment continued. As part of the test plan, extra water pumps were activated at 01:05 on 26 April, increasing the water flow. The increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core (the coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers), which now more closely approached the [[nucleate boiling]] temperature of water, reducing the [[factor of safety|safety margin]].

The flow exceeded the allowed limit at 01:19, triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators. At the same time, the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing [[void coefficient|steam voids]] in the core and the steam separators.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The RBMK is a boiling water reactor, so in-core boiling is normal at higher power levels. The RBMK design has a negative void coefficient above 700&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;/ref&gt; Since water weakly absorbs neutrons (and the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam), turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still. The crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow, in an effort to increase steam pressure, and by removing more manual control rods to maintain power.&lt;ref name="OECD02-Ch1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physiciansofchernobyl.org.ua/rus/books/Karpan.html |title=N. V. Karpan |website=Physicians of Chernobyl Association |language=ru |accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration. Nearly all of the control rods were removed manually, including all but 18 of the "fail-safe" manually operated rods of the minimal 28 which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant, out of a total 211 control rods.&lt;ref name=MedvedevG /&gt; While the emergency [[scram|SCRAM]] system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually (through the "AZ-5" button), the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level, and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed. Further, the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced, which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling, thereby reducing [[neutron absorption]] by the water. The reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers. If anything pushed it into supercriticality, it was unable to recover automatically.

===Experiment and explosion===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Chernobyl burning-aerial view of core.jpg|thumb|Radioactive steam plumes continued to be generated days after the initial explosion, as evidenced here on 3 May 1986 due to [[decay heat]]. The roof of the turbine hall is damaged (image centre). Roof of the adjacent reactor 3 (image lower left) shows minor fire damage. [[Igor Kostin]] would take some of the clearer pictures of the roof of the buildings when he was physically present on the roof of reactor 3, in June of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2011/apr/26/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster-in-pictures |title=Chernobyl nuclear disaster – in pictures |last=Kostin |first=Igor |authorlink=Igor Kostin |date=26 April 2011 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

At 1:23:04&amp;nbsp;a.m., the experiment began. Four of the main circulating pumps (MCP) were active; of the eight total, six are normally active during regular operation. The steam to the turbines was shut off, beginning a run-down of the turbine generator. The diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads; the generators were to have completely picked up the MCPs' power needs by 01:23:43. In the interim, the power for the MCPs was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down. As the [[momentum]] of the turbine generator decreased, so did the power it produced for the pumps. The water flow rate decreased, leading to increased formation of steam voids (bubbles) in the core.

Unlike western [[Light Water Reactor]]s, the RBMK had a positive [[void coefficient]] of reactivity, meaning when water began to boil and produce voids in the coolant, the nuclear chain reaction increases instead of decreasing.
With this feature at low reactor power levels, the no.4 RBMK reactor was now primed to embark on a [[positive feedback]] loop, in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water [[coolant]] to absorb neutrons, which in turn increased the reactor's power output.
This caused yet more water to flash into steam, giving a further power increase. During almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback, inserting [[control rod]]s into the reactor core to limit the power rise. This system had control of only 12 rods, and nearly all others had been manually retracted.

At 1:23:40, as recorded by the [[SKALA]] centralized control system, a [[SCRAM]] (emergency shutdown) of the reactor was initiated. The SCRAM was started when the EPS-5 button (also known as the AZ-5 button) of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed: this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them, including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier. The reason why the EPS-5 button was pressed is not known, whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures, or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment.

There is a view that the SCRAM may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase, although there is no recorded data proving this. Some have suggested that the button was not manually pressed, that the SCRAM signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system, but the SKALA registered a manual SCRAM signal. Despite this, the question as to when or even whether the EPS-5 button was pressed has been the subject of debate. There have been assertions that the manual SCRAM was initiated due to the initial rapid power acceleration. Others have suggested that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to self-destruct, while others believe that it happened earlier and in calm conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=ru |first1=E.

How did it happen? |chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, when the EPS-5 button was pressed, the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began. The control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at 0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s, so that the rods took 18 to 20&amp;nbsp;seconds to travel the full height of the [[nuclear reactor core|core]], about 7 metres. A bigger problem was the design of the [[RBMK#Control rods|RBMK control rods]], each of which had a graphite neutron moderator rod attached to the end to boost reactor output by displacing water when the control rod section had been fully withdrawn from the reactor. Thus, when a control rod was at maximum extraction, a neutron-moderating graphite extension was centered in the core with a 1.25 m column of water above and below it. Therefore, injecting a control rod downward into the reactor during a SCRAM initially displaced (neutron-absorbing) water in the lower portion of the reactor with (neutron-moderating) graphite on its way out of the core. As a result, an emergency SCRAM initially increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite section of rods moving out of the reactor displaced water coolant. This behaviour was revealed when the initial insertion of control rods in another RBMK reactor at [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]] in 1983 induced a power spike, but since the subsequent SCRAM of that reactor was successful, the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance.

A few seconds into the SCRAM, a power spike occurred, and the core overheated, causing some of the [[fuel rod]]s to fracture, blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at one-third insertion, with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core. Within three seconds the reactor output rose above 530&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"/&gt;{{rp|31}}

The subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments; it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation. Apparently, the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup, leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure. This caused the fuel cladding to fail, releasing the fuel elements into the coolant, and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=ru |url=http://www.reactors.narod.ru/pub/chern_2/chern_2.htm |title=Chernobyl as it was – 2 |website=narod.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, according to some estimations, the reactor jumped to around 30,000&amp;nbsp;MW thermal, ten times the normal operational output. The last reading on the control panel was 33,000&amp;nbsp;MW. It was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building, but a [[steam explosion]], like the explosion of a [[steam boiler]] from excess vapour pressure, appears to have been the next event. There is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the reactor's exterior cooling structure that caused the explosion that destroyed the reactor casing, tearing off and blasting the upper plate, to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened, through the roof of the reactor building. This is believed to be the first explosion that many heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=ru |url=http://accidont.ru/Davlet.html |first=R.I. |last=Davletbaev |title=Last shift Chernobyl.

The total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the reactor's thermal power.

A second, more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first; this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator. The ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air, greatly contributing to the spread of [[radioactive fallout]] and the [[radioactive contamination|contamination]] of outlying areas.&lt;ref name="OECD02-Ch1" /&gt;

According to observers outside Unit 4, burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor. Some of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire. About 25 percent of the red-hot graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected. Parts of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building. As a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core. The air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite fire.&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"/&gt;{{rp|32}}{{better source|date=October 2016}}

After the larger explosion, a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage. One such survivor, [[Individual involvement in the Chernobyl disaster#Alexander Yuvchenko|Alexander Yuvchenko]], recounts that once he stepped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall, he saw a "very beautiful" [[LASER]]-like beam of [[light blue|light bluish]] light caused by the [[ionized-air glow|ionization of air]] that appeared to "flood up into [[outer-space|infinity]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_english/cherno-alexander_yuvchenko.htm |title=Cheating Chernobyl: Interview with Alexander Yuvchenko |first=Michael |last=Bond |date=21 August 2004 |magazine=[[New Scientist]] |via=ecolo.org |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pripyat.com/en/articles/chernobyl-20-years.html |title=Chernobyl 20 years on}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |title=Chernobyl: what happened and why? |first=C.M. |last=Meyer |magazine=Energize |date=March 2007 |pages= 40–43 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211073343/http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |archivedate=11 December 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion. One view was that the second explosion was caused by [[hydrogen]], which had been produced either by the overheated steam-[[zircaloy|zirconium]] reaction or by the [[Syngas|reaction of red-hot graphite with steam]] that produced hydrogen and [[carbon monoxide]]. Another hypothesis, by Checherov, published in 1998, was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of [[fast neutron]]s caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=ru |last=Checherov |first=K. P. |title=Development of ideas about reasons and processes of emergency on the 4th unit of Chernobyl NPP 26.04.1986 |publisher=International conference "Shelter-98" |location=Slavutich, Ukraine |date=25–27 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third hypothesis was that the second explosion was another steam explosion. According to this version, the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop, causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam. This second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building.

The force of the second explosion and the ratio of [[isotopes of xenon|xenon radioisotopes]] released after the accident (a vital tool in [[nuclear forensics]]) indicated to Yuri V. Dubasov in a 2009 publication (suggested before him by Checherov in 1998), that the ''second'' explosion could have been a nuclear power transient resulting from core material melting in the absence of its water coolant and moderator. Dubasov argues that the reactor did not simply undergo a runaway [[Prompt criticality#Nuclear reactors|''delayed''-supercritical/exponential increase in power]] into the multi-gigawatt power range, which is somewhat similar to the conditions of a normal reactor coming up to its commercial power level (with the notable exception that Chernobyl's older RBMK reactor design had the largest positive [[void coefficient of reactivity]] of any reactor then operating commercially), permitting a dangerous "positive feedback"/runaway condition, given the lack of [[Passive nuclear safety|''inherent'' safety stops]] when power levels began to increase above the commercial level. Although a positive-feedback power excursion that increased until the reactor disassembled itself by means of its internal energy and external steam explosions&lt;ref name=insag7&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub913e_web.pdf |title=INSAG-7: The Chernobyl Accident: Updating of INSAG-1 |date=1992 |website=IAEA |access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the more accepted explanation for the cause of the explosions, Dubasov argues instead that a runaway [[prompt criticality|''prompt'' supercriticality]] occurred, with the internal physics being more similar to the explosion of a [[fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzled nuclear weapon]], and that this failed/fizzle event produced the ''second'' explosion.&lt;ref name= Pakhomov2009&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00024-009-0029-9 |title=Estimation of Explosion Energy Yield at Chernobyl NPP Accident |year=2009 |last1=Pakhomov |first1=Sergey A. |last2=Dubasov |first2=Yuri V. |journal=Pure and Applied Geophysics |volume=167 |issue=4–5 |page=575 |bibcode=2010PApGe.167..575P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This nuclear fizzle hypothesis, then mostly defended by Dubasov, was examined further in 2017 by retired physicist Lars-Erik De Geer in an analysis that puts the hypothesized fizzle event as the more probable cause of the ''first'' explosion.&lt;ref name="DeGeerNuclearJet"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00295450.2017.1384269 |date=November 2017 |journal=Nuclear Technology |title=A Nuclear Jet at Chernobyl Around 21:23:45 UTC on April 25, 1986 |volume=201 |pages=11–22 |first1=Lars-Erik |last1=De Geer |first2=Christer |last2=Persson |first3=Henning |last3=Rodhe |quote=The first explosion consisted of thermal neutron mediated nuclear explosions in one or rather a few fuel channels, which caused a jet of debris that reached an altitude of some 2500 to 3000 m.

Contrary to safety regulations, [[bitumen]], a combustible material, had been used in the construction of the roof of the reactor building and the turbine hall. Ejected material ignited at least five fires on the roof of the adjacent reactor 3, which was still operating. It was imperative to put those fires out and protect the cooling systems of reactor 3.&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"/&gt;{{rp|42}} Inside reactor 3, the chief of the night shift, Yuri Bagdasarov, wanted to shut down the reactor immediately, but chief engineer Nikolai Fomin would not allow this. The operators were given [[respirator]]s and [[potassium iodide]] tablets and told to continue working. At 05:00, Bagdasarov made his own decision to shut down the reactor, leaving only those operators there who had to work the [[nuclear safety systems|emergency cooling systems]].&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

[[File:Levels of radioactivity in the lava under the Chernobyl number four reactor 1986.svg|thumb|left|350px|Extremely high levels of radioactivity in the lava under the Chernobyl number four reactor in 1986]]

====Radiation levels====

The radiation levels in the worst-hit areas of the reactor building have been estimated to be 5.6&amp;nbsp;[[roentgen (unit)|roentgens]] per second (R/s), equivalent to more than 20,000&amp;nbsp;roentgens per hour. A lethal dose is around 500&amp;nbsp;roentgens (~5&amp;nbsp;[[Gray (unit)|Gy]]) over 5&amp;nbsp;hours, so in some areas, unprotected workers received fatal doses in less than a minute. However, a [[dosimeter]] capable of measuring up to 1000&amp;nbsp;R/s was buried in the rubble of a collapsed part of the building, and another one failed when turned on. All remaining dosimeters had limits of 0.001&amp;nbsp;R/s and therefore read "off scale". Thus, the reactor crew could ascertain only that the radiation levels were somewhere above 0.001&amp;nbsp;R/s (3.6&amp;nbsp;R/h), while the true levels were much higher in some areas.&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"/&gt;{{rp|42–50}}

Because of the inaccurate low readings, the reactor crew chief Alexander Akimov assumed that the reactor was intact. The evidence of pieces of graphite and reactor fuel lying around the building was ignored, and the readings of another dosimeter brought in by 04:30 were dismissed under the assumption that the new dosimeter must have been defective.&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"/&gt;{{rp|42–50}} Akimov stayed with his crew in the reactor building until morning, sending members of his crew to try to pump water into the reactor. None of them wore any protective gear. Most, including Akimov, died from radiation exposure within three weeks.&lt;ref name="MedvedevG"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Medvedev |first=Grigori |title=The Truth About Chernobyl |publisher=VAAP |year=1989 |isbn=978-2-226-04031-2 |edition=Hardcover.

====Fire containment====
[[File:Leonid Telyatnikov (1951-2004) decorated in UK.jpg|thumb|250px|Firefighter [[Leonid Telyatnikov]], being decorated for bravery]]

Shortly after the accident, firefighters arrived to try to extinguish the fires. First on the scene was a Chernobyl Power Station firefighter brigade under the command of Lieutenant [[Vladimir Pravik|Volodymyr Pravik]], who died on 9 May 1986 of [[radiation poisoning|acute radiation sickness]]. They were not told how dangerously radioactive the smoke and the debris were, and may not even have known that the accident was anything more than a regular [[electrical fire]]: "We didn't know it was the reactor. No one had told us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/videos/meltdown-in-chernobyl/ |title=Meltdown in Chernobyl (Video) |date=10 August 2011 |website=[[National Geographic Channel]] |accessdate=21 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621122802/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/videos/meltdown-in-chernobyl/ |archivedate=21 June 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grigorii Khmel, the driver of one of the [[fire engine]]s, later described what happened:

{{quote|text=We arrived there at 10 or 15 minutes to two in the morning.... We saw graphite scattered about. Misha asked: "Is that graphite?" I kicked it away. But one of the fighters on the other truck picked it up. "It's hot," he said. The pieces of graphite were of different sizes, some big, some small, enough to pick them up...

We didn't know much about radiation. Even those who worked there had no idea. There was no water left in the trucks. Misha filled a [[cistern]] and we aimed the water at the top. Then those boys who died went up to the roof – Vashchik, Kolya and others, and Volodya Pravik.... They went up the ladder ... and I never saw them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shcherbak |first=Y. |title=Chernobyl |publisher=Yunost |year=1987 |volume=6 |editor=Medvedev, G. |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}}}}

Anatoli Zakharov, a fireman stationed in Chernobyl since 1980, offers a different description in 2008:

{{quote|text=I remember joking to the others, "There must be an incredible amount of radiation here. We'll be lucky if we're all still alive in the morning."&lt;ref name="nuclruss"/&gt;}}

He also said:

{{quote|text=Of course we knew! If we'd followed regulations, we would never have gone near the reactor. But it was a moral obligation – our duty. We were like [[kamikaze]].&lt;ref name="nuclruss"&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Higginbotham |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/26/nuclear.russia |title=Chernobyl 20 years on |newspaper=[[The Observer]] |date=26 March 2006 |accessdate=22 March 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The immediate priority was to extinguish fires on the roof of the station and the area around the building containing Reactor No.&amp;nbsp;4 to protect No.&amp;nbsp;3 and keep its core cooling systems intact. The fires were extinguished by 5:00, but many firefighters received high doses of radiation. The fire inside reactor 4 continued to burn until 10 May 1986; it is possible that well over half of the graphite burned out.&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"/&gt;{{rp|73}}

The fire was extinguished by a combined effort of helicopters dropping over 5000&amp;nbsp;metric tons of sand, lead, clay, and [[neutron capture|neutron-absorbing]] [[boron]] onto the burning reactor and injection of [[liquid nitrogen]]. It is now known that virtually none of the neutron absorbers reached the core.&lt;ref name="BBCContaining"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1997/chernobyl/33005.stm |title=Special Report: 1997: Chernobyl: Containing Chernobyl? |website=BBC News |date=21 November 1997 |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From eyewitness accounts of the firefighters involved before they died (as reported on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] television series [[Witness (TV series)|''Witness'']]), one described his experience of the radiation as "tasting like metal", and feeling a sensation similar to that of [[Paresthesia|pins and needles]] all over his face. (This is similar to the description given by [[Louis Slotin]], a [[Manhattan Project]] physicist who died days after a fatal radiation overdose from a [[Demon core|criticality accident]].)&lt;ref name="zeilig22"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zeilig |first=Martin |date=August–September 1995 |title=Louis Slotin And 'The Invisible Killer' |journal=The Beaver |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=20–27 |url=http://www.mphpa.org/classic/FH/LA/Louis_Slotin_1.htm |accessdate=28 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516101332/http://www.mphpa.org/classic/FH/LA/Louis_Slotin_1.htm |archivedate=16 May 2008 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosion and fire threw hot particles of the [[nuclear fuel]] and also far more dangerous [[fission product]]s, radioactive isotopes such as [[caesium-137]], [[iodine-131]], [[strontium-90]] and other [[radionuclides]], into the air: the residents of the surrounding area observed the radioactive cloud on the night of the explosion.

Equipment assembled included remote-controlled bulldozers and robot-carts that could detect radioactivity and carry hot debris. Valery Legasov (first deputy director of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow) said, in 1987: "But we learned that robots are not the great remedy for everything. Where there was very high radiation, the robot ceased to be a robot—the electronics quit working."&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Chernobyl – One Year After |date=May 1987 |magazine=[[National Geographic]] |volume=171 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearby city of Pripyat was not immediately evacuated. The townspeople, in the early hours of the morning, at 01:23 AM local time, went about their usual business, completely oblivious to what had just happened. However, within a few hours of the explosion, dozens of people fell ill. Later, they reported severe headaches and metallic tastes in their mouths, along with uncontrollable fits of coughing and vomiting.&lt;ref name=TimeDisaster&gt;{{cite book |title=Disasters that Shook the World |publisher=Time Home Entertainment |location=New York City |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-60320-247-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=October 2018}}

As the plant was run by authorities in Moscow, the government of Ukraine did not receive prompt information on the accident.&lt;ref name="shevchenko"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2011/04/25/36971/ |title=Валентина Шевченко: 'Провести демонстрацію 1 травня 1986-го наказали з Москви' |website=[[Ukrayinska Pravda|Istorychna Pravda]] |language=uk |date=25 April 2011 |accessdate=20 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426221138/http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2011/04/25/36971/ |archivedate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Valentyna Shevchenko (politician)|Valentyna Shevchenko]], then Chairman of the Presidium of [[Verkhovna Rada]] Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR, recalls that Ukraine's acting [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Minister of Internal Affairs]] [[Vasyl Durdynets]] phoned her at work at 9&amp;nbsp;am to report current affairs; only at the end of the conversation did he add that there had been a fire at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but it was extinguished and everything was fine. When Shevchenko asked "How are the people?", he replied that there was nothing to be concerned about: "Some are celebrating a wedding, others are gardening, and others are fishing in the [[Pripyat River]]".&lt;ref name="shevchenko"/&gt;
Shevchenko then spoke over the phone to [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]], [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine|Head]] of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|CPU]] and de facto head of state, who said he anticipated a delegation of the state commission headed by the deputy chairman of the [[Council of Ministers of USSR]].&lt;ref name="shevchenko"/&gt;

A commission was set up the same day (26 April) to investigate the accident. It was headed by [[Valery Legasov]], First Deputy Director of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, and included leading nuclear specialist [[Evgeny Velikhov]], hydro-meteorologist [[Yuri Izrael]], radiologist [[Leonid Ilyin]] and others. They flew to [[Boryspil International Airport]] and arrived at the power plant in the evening of 26 April.&lt;ref name="shevchenko"/&gt; By that time two people had already died and 52 were hospitalized. The delegation soon had ample evidence that the reactor was destroyed and extremely high levels of radiation had caused a number of cases of radiation exposure. In the early daylight hours of 27 April, approximately 36 hours after the initial blast, they ordered the [[emergency evacuation|evacuation]] of Pripyat. Initially it was decided to evacuate the population for three days; later this was made permanent.&lt;ref name="shevchenko"/&gt;

By 11:00 on 27 April, buses had arrived in Pripyat to start the evacuation.&lt;ref name="shevchenko"/&gt; The evacuation began at 14:00. A translated excerpt of the evacuation announcement follows:&lt;ref name="pripyat evacuation announcement"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Meltdown in Chernobyl |series=Seconds From Disaster |serieslink=Seconds From Disaster |credits=Director: Maninderpal Sahota; Narrator: Ashton Smith; Producer: Greg Lanning; Edited by: Chris Joyce |network=[[National Geographic Channel]] |date=17 August 2004 |season=1 |number=7 |minutes=30/40–50 minutes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|sign=Evacuation announcement in Pripyat, 27 April 1986 (14:00)|source=|For the attention of the residents of Pripyat! The City Council informs you that due to the accident at Chernobyl Power Station in the city of Pripyat the radioactive conditions in the vicinity are deteriorating. The Communist Party, its officials and the armed forces are taking necessary steps to combat this. Nevertheless, with the view to keep people as safe and healthy as possible, the children being top priority, we need to temporarily evacuate the citizens in the nearest towns of Kiev region. For these reasons, starting from 27 April 1986 2&amp;nbsp;pm each apartment block will be able to have a bus at its disposal, supervised by the police and the city officials. It is highly advisable to take your documents, some vital personal belongings and a certain amount of food, just in case, with you. The senior executives of public and industrial facilities of the city has decided on the list of employees needed to stay in Pripyat to maintain these facilities in a good working order. All the houses will be guarded by the police during the evacuation period. Comrades, leaving your residences temporarily please make sure you have turned off the lights, electrical equipment and water and shut the windows. Please keep calm and orderly in the process of this short-term evacuation.}}

To expedite the evacuation, residents were told to bring only what was necessary, and that they would remain evacuated for approximately three days. As a result, most personal belongings were left behind, and remain there today. By 15:00, 53,000 people were evacuated to various villages of the [[Kiev Oblast|Kiev region]].&lt;ref name="shevchenko"/&gt; The next day, talks began for evacuating people from the 10&amp;nbsp;km zone.&lt;ref name="shevchenko"/&gt; Ten days after the accident, the evacuation area was expanded to 30&amp;nbsp;km (19&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref name="MarplesSocialImpact"&gt;{{cite book |year=1988 |title=The Social Impact of the Chernobyl Disaster |location=New York, NY |publisher=St Martin's Press |last=Marples |first=David R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|115,120–1}} This [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Exclusion Zone|"exclusion zone"]] has remained ever since, although its shape has changed and its size has been expanded.

====Delayed announcement of the accident====
Evacuation began long before the accident was publicly acknowledged by the Soviet Union. On the morning of 28 April, radiation levels set off alarms at the [[Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant]] in Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chernobyl haunts engineer who alerted world |date=26 April 1996 |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9604/26/chernobyl/230pm/index2.html |website=[[CNN]] |accessdate=28 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; over {{convert|1000|km|mi}} from the Chernobyl Plant. Sweden determined that the radiation had originated elsewhere, and the Swedish government contacted the Soviet government, The Soviet government denied being the source of the radiation, until the Swedish government advised the Soviet government that a report was being made to the International Atomic Energy Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=4468603 |title=25 years after Chernobyl, how Sweden found out |date=22 April 2011 |website=[[Sveriges Radio]] |access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 21:02 the evening of 28 April, a 20-second announcement was read in the TV news programme ''[[Vremya]]'':&lt;ref name="GalleryTimeline"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vremya"&gt;{{ru icon}} {{YouTube|sC7n_QgJRks|Video footage of Chernobyl disaster on 28 April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There has been an accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. One of the nuclear reactors was damaged. The effects of the accident are being remedied. Assistance has been provided for any affected people. An investigative commission has been set up.|sign=''[[Vremya]]'', 28 April 1986 (21:00)&lt;ref name="vremya"/&gt;}}

This was the entirety of the announcement of the accident. The [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] (TASS) then discussed [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] and other American nuclear accidents, an example of the common Soviet tactic of [[whataboutism|emphasizing foreign disasters]] when one occurred in the Soviet Union. The mention of a commission, however, indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident,&lt;ref name="schmemann19860429"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0426.html |title=Soviet Announces Nuclear Accident at Electric Plant |newspaper=The New York Times |date=29 April 1986 |accessdate=26 April 2014 |last=Schmemann |first=Serge |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music, which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy.&lt;ref name="GalleryTimeline"/&gt;

Around the same time, [[ABC News]] released its report about the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istpravda.com.ua/videos/2011/04/25/36966/ |title=1986: американський ТБ-сюжет про Чорнобиль. Порівняйте з радянським |work=Історична правда |date=25 April 2011 |language=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shevchenko was the first of the Ukrainian state top officials to arrive at the disaster site early on 28 April. There she spoke with members of medical staff and people, who were calm and hopeful that they could soon return to their homes. Shevchenko returned home near midnight, stopping at a radiological checkpoint in Vilcha, one of the first that were set up soon after the accident.&lt;ref name="shevchenko"/&gt;

There was a notification from Moscow that there was no reason to postpone the 1 May [[International Workers' Day]] celebrations in Kiev (including the annual parade), but on 30 April a meeting of the Political bureau of the Central Committee of CPU took place to discuss the plan for the upcoming celebration. Scientists were reporting that the radiological background in Kiev city was normal. At the meeting, which was finished at 18:00, it was decided to shorten celebrations from the regular 3.5–4 to under 2 hours.&lt;ref name="shevchenko"/&gt;

Several buildings in Pripyat were officially kept open after the disaster to be used by workers still involved with the plant. These included the [[Jupiter (Factory)|Jupiter Factory]] which closed in 1996 and the [[Azure Swimming Pool]], used by the [[Chernobyl liquidators|liquidators]] for recreation during the clean-up, which closed in 1998.

====Steam explosion risk====
Two floors of bubbler pools beneath the reactor served as a large water reservoir for the emergency cooling pumps and as a pressure suppression system capable of condensing steam in case of a small broken steam pipe; the third floor above them, below the reactor, served as a steam tunnel. The steam released by a broken pipe was supposed to enter the steam tunnel and be led into the pools to bubble through a layer of water. After the disaster, the pools and the basement were flooded because of ruptured cooling water pipes and accumulated firefighting water, and constituted a serious steam explosion risk.

Once the bubbler pool gates were opened by the Ananenko team, fire brigade pumps were then used to drain the basement. The operation was not completed until 8 May, after 20,000&amp;nbsp;metric tons of highly radioactive water were pumped out.

With the bubbler pool gone, a meltdown was less likely to produce a powerful steam explosion. To do so, the molten core would now have to reach the [[water table]] below the reactor. To reduce the likelihood of this, it was decided to freeze the earth beneath the reactor, which would also stabilize the foundations. Using [[Well drilling|oil drilling equipment]], the injection of liquid nitrogen began on 4 May. It was estimated that 25&amp;nbsp;metric tons of liquid nitrogen per day would be required to keep the soil frozen at −100&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="MedvedevZ"/&gt;{{rp|59}} This idea&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://hawaiinewsdaily.com/2011/03/when-the-fukushima-meltdown-hits-groundwater |title=When the Fukushima Meltdown Hits Groundwater |first=Tom |last=Burnett |date=28 March 2011 |website=Hawai'i News Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; was soon scrapped and the bottom room where the cooling system would have been installed was filled with concrete.

It is likely that intense [[alpha radiation]] [[radiolysis|hydrolysed]] the water, generating a low-[[pH]] [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) solution akin to an [[oxidizing acid]].&lt;ref name=Sattonnay&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-3115(00)00714-5 |title=Alpha-radiolysis effects on UO2 alteration in water |year=2001 |last1=Sattonnay |first1=G. |last2=Ardois |first2=C. |last3=Corbel |first3=C. |last4=Lucchini |first4=J.

====Debris removal====
[[File:Chernobylreactor 1.jpg|thumb|267px|Chernobyl power plant in 2006 with the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus|sarcophagus containment structure]]]]

The worst of the radioactive [[debris]] was collected inside what was left of the reactor. During clean-up operations, remotely controlled machinery were used to try to move the most highly radioactive debris, but these failed in the harsh conditions. Consequently, the most highly radioactive materials were shoveled by [[Chernobyl liquidators]] from the military wearing heavy protective gear (dubbed "bio-robots" by the military); these soldiers could only spend a maximum of 40&amp;nbsp;seconds working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris. Though the soldiers were only supposed to perform the role of the "bio-robot" a maximum of once, some soldiers reported having done this task five or six times. The reactor itself was covered with bags of sand, lead and [[boric acid]] dropped from helicopters: some 5000 metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident. Historians estimate that about 600 Soviet pilots risked dangerous levels of radiation to fly the thousands of flights needed to cover reactor No. 4 in this attempt to seal off radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rotorandwing.com/2016/04/26/chernobyl-anniversary-recalls-helo-pilots-bravery/ |title=Chernobyl Anniversary Recalls Helo Pilots' Bravery |first=James T. |last=McKenna |date=26 April 2016 |website=Rotor &amp; Wing International |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time there was still fear that the reactor could re-enter a self-sustaining nuclear chain-reaction and explode again, and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion, and to prevent further release of radioactive material. This was the largest civil engineering task in history, involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation.&lt;ref name="BBCContaining"/&gt; The Ukrainian filmmaker [[Vladimir Shevchenko]] captured film footage of an [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]] helicopter as its main rotor collided with a nearby [[construction crane]] cable, causing the helicopter to fall near the damaged reactor building and killing its four-man crew on 2 October 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube |id= aw-ik1U4Uvk |title= Mil Mi-8 crash near Chernobyl}} 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1986, a large concrete [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus|sarcophagus]] had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents.&lt;ref name="MarplesSocialImpact"/&gt; A unique "clean up" medal was given to the workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collectinghistory.net/chernobyl/index.html |title=Medal for Service at the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster |website=CollectingHistory.net |date=26 April 1986 |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many of the radioactive emergency vehicles were buried in trenches, many of the vehicles used by the liquidators, including the helicopters, still remain parked in a field in the Chernobyl area. Scavengers have since removed many functioning, but highly radioactive, parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_chernobyl0s_silent_graveyards_/html/1.stm |title=Chernobyl's silent graveyards |date=20 April 2006 |website=BBC News |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the construction of the sarcophagus, a scientific team re-entered the reactor as part of an investigation dubbed "Complex Expedition", to locate and contain nuclear fuel in a way that could not lead to another explosion. These scientists manually collected cold fuel rods, but great heat was still emanating from the core. Rates of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes. The scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust.&lt;ref name="BBCContaining"/&gt;

After six months of investigation, in December 1986, they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of Unit Four, more than two metres wide, which they called "[[The Elephant's Foot|the elephant's foot]]" for its wrinkled appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://nautil.us/blog/chernobyls-hot-mess-the-elephants-foot-is-still-lethal |title=Chernobyl's Hot Mess, 'the Elephant's Foot', Is Still Lethal |first=Kyle |last=Hill |date=4 December 2013 |magazine=[[Nautilus (science magazine)|Nautilus]] |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mass was composed of melted sand, concrete and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor. The concrete beneath the reactor was steaming hot, and was breached by now-solidified lava and spectacular unknown crystalline forms termed [[chernobylite]]. It was concluded that there was no further risk of explosion.&lt;ref name="BBCContaining"/&gt;

Liquidators worked under deplorable conditions, poorly informed and with poor protection. Many, if not most of them, exceeded radiation safety limits.&lt;ref name="MarplesSocialImpact"/&gt;{{rp|177–183}}&lt;ref name="PetrynaLE"&gt;{{cite book |last=Petryna |first=Adriana |year=2002 |title=Life Exposed: Biological Citizens After Chernobyl |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Some exceeded limits by over 100 times—leading to rapid death.&lt;ref name="MarplesSocialImpact"/&gt;{{rp|187}}

The official contaminated zones became stage to a massive clean-up effort lasting seven months.&lt;ref name="MarplesSocialImpact"/&gt;{{rp|177–183}} The official reason for such early (and dangerous) decontamination efforts, rather than allowing time for natural decay, was that the land must be re-peopled and brought back into cultivation. Indeed, within fifteen months 75% of the land was under cultivation, even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled. Defence forces must have done much of the work. Yet this land was of marginal agricultural value. According to historian David Marples, the administration had a psychological purpose for the clean-up: they wished to forestall panic regarding nuclear energy, and even to restart the Chernobyl power station.&lt;ref name="MarplesSocialImpact"/&gt;{{rp|78–9,87,192–3}}

==Causes==
There were two official explanations of the accident.

===INSAG-1 Report (1986)===
The first official explanation of the accident, later acknowledged to be erroneous, was published in August 1986. It effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators. To investigate the causes of the accident the [[IAEA]] created a group known as the [[International Nuclear Safety Group|International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group]] (INSAG), which in its report of 1986, INSAG-1, on the whole also supported this view, based on the data provided by the Soviets and the oral statements of specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www-ns.iaea.org/committees/insag.asp |title=Summary Report on the Post-Accident Review on the Chernobyl Accident |authors=IAEA Report INSAG-1 (International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group) |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations. "During preparation and testing of the turbine generator under run-down conditions using the auxiliary load, personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise."&lt;ref name="atom"/&gt;{{rp|311}}

The operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of [[nuclear reactor physics]] and [[nuclear engineering|engineering]], as well as lack of experience and training. According to these allegations, at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off, most notably the [[Emergency Core Cooling System]] (ECCS), LAR (Local Automatic control system), and AZ (emergency power reduction system). Personnel had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor, and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion.&lt;ref name="atom"/&gt;

{{quote|The developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis, namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures. Thus the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff.&lt;ref name="atom"/&gt;{{rp|312}}}}

In this analysis of the causes of the accident, deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually. Serious critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident.

The following general picture arose from these observations, and several procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible, one of which was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night.

The reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators, which the test was really about. The main process computer, SKALA, was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power. Normally the computer would have started to insert all of the [[control rods]]. The computer would have also started the "Emergency Core Protection System" that introduces 24 control rods into the active zone within 2.5 seconds, which is still slow by 1986 standards. All control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators.

On the subject of the disconnection of safety systems, Valery Legasov said, in 1987, that "[i]t was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight".&lt;ref name="NatGeo"/&gt;

This view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the Chernobyl accident that appeared immediately after the accident,&lt;ref name=MedvedevZ/&gt; and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications.

===INSAG-7 Report (1992)===

Ukraine has declassified a number of [[KGB]] documents from the period between 1971 and 1988 related to the Chernobyl plant, mentioning for example previous reports of structural damages caused by negligence during construction of the plant (such as splitting of concrete layers) that were never acted upon. They document over 29 emergency situations in the plant during this period, 8 of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tsdea.archives.gov.ua/ru/index_ch.php?page=ch_doc |title=Украина рассекретила документы, касающиеся аварии на Чернобыльской АЭС |trans-title=Ukraine has declassified documents relating to the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant |website=Central State Electronic Archives of Ukraine |language=ru |accessdate=13 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006160927/http://tsdea.archives.gov.ua/ru/index_ch.php?page=ch_doc |archivedate=6 October 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 a Commission of the USSR State Committee for the Supervision of Safety in Industry and Nuclear Power reassessed the causes and circumstances of the Chernobyl accident and came to new insights and conclusions. Based on it, in 1992 the IAEA Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG) published an additional report, INSAG-7,&lt;ref name=insag7/&gt; which reviewed "that part of the INSAG-1 report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident," and was included the USSR State Commission report as Appendix I.&lt;ref name=insag7/&gt;

In this INSAG report, most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous, based on incorrect information obtained in August 1986, or less relevant. This report reflected a different view of the main reasons for the accident, presented in Appendix I. According to this account, the operators' actions in turning off the Emergency Core Cooling System, interfering with the settings on the protection equipment, and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude, although they may have been a breach of regulations. In fact, turning off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations.&lt;ref name=insag7/&gt;

Human factors, however, contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster. These included operating the reactor at a low power level—less than 700&amp;nbsp;MW—a level documented in the run-down test programme, and operating with a small [[Reactivity (nuclear)|operational reactivity margin]] (ORM). The 1986 assertions of Soviet experts notwithstanding, regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level.&lt;ref name=insag7/&gt;{{rp|18}}

However, regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity. Yet "post-accident studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the ORM is reflected in the Operating Procedures and design documentation for the RBMK-1000 is extremely contradictory", and furthermore, "ORM was not treated as an operational safety limit, violation of which could lead to an accident".&lt;ref name=insag7/&gt;{{rp|34–25}}

According to the INSAG-7 Report, the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor. There are two such reasons:&lt;ref name=insag7/&gt;{{rp|18}}
* The reactor had a dangerously large positive [[void coefficient of reactivity]]. The void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant. Most other reactor designs have a negative coefficient, i.e. the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant, since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases, fewer [[neutrons]] are slowed down. [[Fast neutron|Faster neutrons]] are less likely to split [[uranium]] atoms, so the reactor produces less power (a negative feedback). Chernobyl's RBMK reactor, however, used solid [[nuclear graphite|graphite]] as a [[neutron moderator]] to [[thermal neutrons|slow down the neutrons]], and the water in it, on the contrary, acts like a harmful [[neutron absorber]]. Thus neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water. Furthermore, because steam [[neutron capture|absorbs neutrons]] much less readily than water, increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms, increasing the reactor's power output. This makes the RBMK design very unstable at low power levels, and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level. This behaviour is [[counter-intuitive]], and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew.
* A more significant flaw was in the design of the [[control rods]] that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction. In the RBMK reactor design, the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was 1.3 metres shorter than necessary, and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water. The upper part of the rod, the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction, was made of [[boron carbide]]. With this design, when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position, the graphite parts initially displace some water (which absorbs neutrons, as mentioned above), effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially. Thus for the first few seconds of control rod activation, reactor power output is increased, rather than reduced as desired. This behaviour is counter-intuitive and was not known to the reactor operators.
* Other deficiencies besides these were noted in the RBMK-1000 reactor design, as were its non-compliance with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety.

While INSAG-1 and INSAG-7 reports both identified operator error as an issue of concern, the INSAG-7 identified that there were numerous other issues that were contributing factors that led to the incident. These contributing factors include:&lt;ref name=insag7/&gt;
* The plant was not designed to safety standards in effect and incorporated unsafe features
* "Inadequate safety analysis" was performed
* There was "insufficient attention to independent safety review"
* "Operating procedures not founded satisfactorily in safety analysis"
* Safety information not adequately and effectively communicated between operators, and between operators and designers
* The operators did not adequately understand safety aspects of the plant
* Operators did not sufficiently respect formal requirements of operational and test procedures
* The regulatory regime was insufficient to effectively counter pressures for production
* There was a "general lack of safety culture in nuclear matters at the national level as well as locally"

===Analysis of views===
Both views were heavily [[lobbied]] by different groups, including the reactor's designers, power plant personnel, and the Soviet and Ukrainian governments. According to the IAEA's 1986 analysis, the main cause of the accident was the operators' actions. But according to the IAEA's 1993 revised analysis the main cause was the reactor's design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.insc.anl.gov/neisb/neisb4/NEISB_3.3.A1.html |chapter=Chernobyl (Chornobyl) Nuclear Power Plant |title=NEI Source Book |edition=4th |publisher=Nuclear Energy Institute |accessdate=31 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2011/http://www.insc.anl.gov/neisb/neisb4/NEISB_3.3.A1.html |archivedate=2 July 2016 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the Chernobyl accident was that the primary data covering the disaster, as registered by the instruments and sensors, were not completely published in the official sources.

Once again, the [[human factor]] had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident. INSAG notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough: witness the length of time for which the ECCS was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power. INSAG's view is that it was the operating crew's deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame. "Most reprehensibly, unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot, although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test."&lt;ref name=insag7/&gt;{{rp|24}}

As in the previously released report INSAG-1, close attention is paid in report INSAG-7 to the inadequate (at the moment of the accident) "culture of safety" at all levels. Deficiency in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also, and to no lesser extent, during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants (including design, engineering, construction, manufacture, and regulation). The poor quality of operating procedures and instructions, and their conflicting character, put a heavy burden on the operating crew, including the chief engineer. "The accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture, not only at the Chernobyl plant, but throughout the Soviet design, operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time."&lt;ref name="insag7"/&gt;{{rp|24}}

==Environmental effects==
{{Main|Effects of the Chernobyl disaster}}

===National and international spread of radioactive substances===

Although no informing comparisons can be made between the accident and a strictly [[air burst]]-fuzed nuclear detonation, it has still been approximated that about four hundred times more radioactive material was released from Chernobyl than by the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. By contrast the Chernobyl accident released about one hundredth to one thousandth of the total amount of radioactivity released during the era of [[nuclear weapons testing]] at the height of the Cold War, 1950 – 1960s, with the 1/100 to 1/1000 variance due to trying to make comparisons with different spectrums of isotopes released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/Chernoten/facts.html |title=Facts: The accident was by far the most devastating in the history of nuclear power |website=International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) |date=21 September 1997 |accessdate=20 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805035908/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/Chernoten/facts.html |archivedate=5 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 100,000&amp;nbsp;km² of land was significantly contaminated with fallout, with the worst hit regions being in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.&lt;ref name="MarplesDecade"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marples |first=David R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xAwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage |title=The Decade of Despair |journal=The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |date=May–June 1996 |volume=52 |pages=20–31 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slighter levels of contamination were detected over all of Europe except for the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=torch/&gt;&lt;ref name="RFI 24"&gt;{{Cite news |language=fr |title=Tchernobyl, 20 ans après |website=[[Radio France Internationale|RFI]] |date=24 April 2006 |accessdate=24 April 2006 |url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/076/article_43250.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=fr |title=L'accident et ses conséquences: Le panache radioactif |trans-title=The accident and its consequences: The plume |website=Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire (IRSN) |accessdate=16 December 2006 |url=http://www.irsn.fr/FR/popup/Pages/tchernobyl_animation_nuage.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from Soviet sources, but from Sweden. On the morning of 28 April&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull283/28302793032.pdf |journal=IAEA Bulletin |date=Autumn 1986 |title=International Reports – Sweden: Monitoring the Fallout |first=Mikael |last=Jensen |first2=John-Christer |last2=Lindhé |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628234739/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull283/28302793032.pdf |archivedate=28 June 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; workers at the Forsmark Nuclear Power Plant (approximately {{convert|1100|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} from the Chernobyl site) were found to have radioactive particles on their clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard Francis |last=Mould |title=Chernobyl Record: The Definitive History of the Chernobyl Catastrophe |isbn=978-0-7503-0670-6 |publisher=CRC Press |year=2000 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was Sweden's search for the source of radioactivity, after they had determined there was no leak at the Swedish plant, that at noon on 28 April led to the first hint of a serious nuclear problem in the western Soviet Union. Hence the evacuation of Pripyat on 27 April 36 hours after the initial explosions, was silently completed before the disaster became known outside the Soviet Union. The rise in radiation levels had at that time already been measured in [[Finland]], but a civil service strike delayed the response and publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.stuk.fi/julkaisut/stuk-a/stuk-a217-s.1-198.pdf |title=Ympäristön Radioaktiivisuus Suomessa – 20 Vuotta Tshernobylista |trans-title=Environmental Radioactivity in Finland – 20 Years from Chernobyl |editor-first=T.K. |editor-last=Ikäheimonen |publisher=Säteilyturvakeskus Stralsäkerhetscentralen (STUK, Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808223651/http://www.stuk.fi/julkaisut/stuk-a/stuk-a217-s.1-198.pdf |archivedate=8 August 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contamination from the Chernobyl accident was scattered irregularly depending on weather conditions, much of it deposited on mountainous regions such as the [[Alps]], the [[Wales|Welsh]] mountains and the [[Scottish Highlands]], where [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic cooling]] caused radioactive rainfall. The resulting patches of contamination were often highly localized, and water-flows across the ground contributed further to large variations in radioactivity over small areas. Sweden and Norway also received heavy fallout when the contaminated air collided with a cold front, bringing rain.&lt;ref name="GouldFire"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first=Peter |year=1990 |title=Fire In the Rain: The Dramatic Consequences of Chernobyl |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43–44, 78}}

Rain was purposely [[Cloud seeding|seeded]] over 10,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the [[Belorussian SSR]] by the Soviet air force to remove radioactive particles from clouds heading toward highly populated areas. Heavy, black-coloured rain fell on the city of [[Gomel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1549366/How-we-made-the-Chernobyl-rain.html |title=How we made the Chernobyl rain |last=Gray |first=Richard |date=22 April 2007 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=27 November 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports from Soviet and Western scientists indicate that Belarus received about 60% of the contamination that fell on the former Soviet Union. However, the 2006 TORCH report stated that half of the volatile particles had landed outside Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. A large area in Russia south of [[Bryansk]] was also contaminated, as were parts of northwestern Ukraine. Studies in surrounding countries indicate that over one million people could have been affected by radiation.&lt;ref name="WNA-Chernobyl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/Safety-and-Security/Safety-of-Plants/Chernobyl-Accident/ |title=Chernobyl Accident 1986 |date=April 2015 |website=[[World Nuclear Association]] |accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resettlement may even be possible in prohibited areas provided that people comply with appropriate dietary rules.

In Western Europe, precautionary measures taken in response to the radiation included seemingly arbitrary regulations banning the importation of certain foods but not others. In France some officials stated that the Chernobyl accident had no adverse effects.&lt;ref name="FrenchCom"&gt;[[:fr:Conséquences de la catastrophe de Tchernobyl en France]]&lt;/ref&gt; Official figures in southern [[Bavaria]] in Germany indicated that some wild plant species contained substantial levels of caesium, which were believed to have been passed onto them during their consumption by wild boars, a significant number of which already contained radioactive particles above the allowed level.{{clarify|reason=slightly awkward English, suggest clarification of the radioactivity relationship between plants and boars|date=March 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/radioactive-boars-on-loose-in-germany-2048308.html |title='Radioactive boars' on loose in Germany |date=10 August 2010 |agency=Agence France Presse |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radioactive release===
Like many [[nuclear fuel and reactor accidents|other releases of radioactivity]] into the environment, the Chernobyl release was controlled by the physical and chemical properties of the radioactive elements in the core. Particularly dangerous are the highly radioactive [[fission products]], those with high [[nuclear decay]] rates that accumulate in the food chain, such as some of the isotopes of [[iodine]], [[caesium]] and [[strontium]]. Iodine-131 and caesium-137 are responsible for most of the radiation exposure received by the general population.&lt;ref name="OECD02-Ch2"/&gt;

Detailed reports on the release of radioisotopes from the site were published in 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=P. |last=Gudiksen |title=Chernobyl Source Term, Atmospheric Dispersion, and Dose Estimation |journal=Health Physics |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=697–706 |year=1989 |display-authors=etal |doi=10.1097/00004032-198911000-00001 |pmid= 2592202 |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1060364/ |type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1995,&lt;ref name="OECD1995"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/chernobyl/chernobyl-1995.pdf |title=Chernobyl, Ten Years On: Assessment of Radiological and Health Impact |year=1995 |website=OECD-NEA |accessdate= 3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter report updated in 2002.&lt;ref name="OECD02-Ch2"/&gt;

[[Image:Totalexternaldoseratecher.png|thumb|300px|The [[Equivalent dose|external relative gamma dose]] for a person in the open near the Chernobyl disaster site.]]

At different times after the accident, different [[isotope]]s were responsible for the majority of the external dose. The remaining quantity of any radioisotope, and therefore the activity of that isotope, after 7 decay [[half-life|half-lives]] have passed, is less than 1% of its initial magnitude,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srp-uk.org/resources/rules-of-thumb-a-practical-hints |title=Rules of Thumb &amp; Practical Hints |website=Society for Radiological Protection |accessdate=12 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628183818/http://www.srp-uk.org/resources/rules-of-thumb-a-practical-hints |archive-date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it continues to reduce beyond 0.78% after 7 half-lives to 0.098% remaining after 10 half-lives have passed and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/isotopes/radioactive_decay3.html |title=Halflife |website=[[University of Colorado Boulder]] |date=20 September 1999 |accessdate=12 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130830080624/http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/isotopes/radioactive_decay3.html |archivedate=30 August 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ken |last=Lyle |url=http://www.chem.purdue.edu/gchelp/howtosolveit/Nuclear/Half_Life.htm |title=Mathematical half life decay rate equations |website=[[Purdue University]] |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Some radionuclides have decay products that are likewise radioactive, which is not accounted for here.) The release of radioisotopes from the nuclear fuel was largely controlled by their [[boiling point]]s, and the majority of the [[radioactivity]] present in the core was retained in the reactor.

Two sizes of particles were released: small particles of 0.3 to 1.5 [[micrometres]], each an individually unrecognizable small dust or smog sized [[particulate matter]] and larger [[particulate matter|settling dust]] sized particles that therefore were quicker to ''fall-out'' of the air, of 10 micrometres in diameter. These larger particles contained about 80% to 90% of the released high boiling point or non-volatile radioisotopes; [[zirconium-95]], [[niobium-95]], [[lanthanum-140]], [[cerium-144]] and the [[transuranic elements]], including [[neptunium]], plutonium and the [[minor actinides]], embedded in a [[uranium oxide]] matrix.

The dose that was calculated is the [[equivalent dose|relative]] external gamma dose rate for a person standing in the open. The exact dose to a person in the real world who would spend most of their time sleeping indoors in a [[fallout shelter|shelter]] and then venturing out to consume an [[internal dose]] from the inhalation or ingestion of a [[radioisotope]], requires a personnel specific [[radiation dose reconstruction]] analysis.

====Rivers, lakes and reservoirs====
[[File:Chernobyl, Ukraine.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Earth Observing-1]] image of the reactor and surrounding area in April 2009]]

The Chernobyl nuclear power plant is located next to the Pripyat River, which feeds into the Dnieper reservoir system, one of the largest surface water systems in Europe, which at the time supplied water to Kiev's 2.4 million residents, and was still in spring flood when the accident occurred.&lt;ref name="MarplesSocialImpact"/&gt;{{rp|60}} The radioactive contamination of aquatic systems therefore became a major problem in the immediate aftermath of the accident.&lt;ref name=smithber05&gt;{{Cite book |title=Chernobyl: Catastrophe and Consequences |first1=Jim T. |last1=Smith |first2=Nicholas A. |last2=Beresford |date=2005 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |isbn=3-540-23866-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the most affected areas of Ukraine, levels of radioactivity (particularly from radionuclides &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I, &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs and &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr) in drinking water caused concern during the weeks and months after the accident,&lt;ref name=smithber05/&gt; though officially it was stated that all contaminants had settled to the bottom "in an insoluble phase" and would not dissolve for 800–1000 years.&lt;ref name="MarplesSocialImpact"/&gt;{{rp|64}} Guidelines for levels of radioiodine in drinking water were temporarily raised to 3,700&amp;nbsp;[[Becquerel|Bq]]/L, allowing most water to be reported as safe,&lt;ref name=smithber05/&gt; and a year after the accident it was announced that even the water of the Chernobyl plant's cooling pond was within acceptable norms. Despite this, two months after the disaster the Kiev water supply was abruptly switched from the Dnieper to the [[Desna River]].&lt;ref name="MarplesSocialImpact"/&gt;{{rp|64–5}} Meanwhile, massive silt traps were constructed, along with an enormous 30m-deep underground barrier to prevent groundwater from the destroyed reactor entering the Pripyat River.&lt;ref name="MarplesSocialImpact"/&gt;{{rp|65–67}}

====Groundwater====

[[Groundwater]] was not badly affected by the Chernobyl accident since [[radionuclide]]s with short half-lives decayed away long before they could affect groundwater supplies, and longer-lived radionuclides such as radiocaesium and radiostrontium were [[adsorption|adsorbed]] to surface [[soil]]s before they could transfer to groundwater.&lt;ref name="IAEA"/&gt; However, significant transfers of radionuclides to groundwater have occurred from [[waste disposal]] sites in the {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} exclusion zone around Chernobyl. Although there is a potential for transfer of radionuclides from these disposal sites off-site (i.e. out of the {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} exclusion zone), the IAEA Chernobyl Report&lt;ref name=IAEA/&gt; argues that this is not significant in comparison to current levels of [[Washout (erosion)|washout]] of surface-deposited radioactivity.

====Flora and fauna====
After the disaster, four square kilometres of [[pine]] forest directly downwind of the reactor turned reddish-brown and died, earning the name of the "[[Red Forest]]".&lt;ref name=bbcmulvey/&gt; Some animals in the worst-hit areas also died or stopped reproducing.

The Norwegian Agricultural Authority reported that in 2009 a total of 18,000 livestock in Norway needed to be given uncontaminated feed for a period of time before slaughter in order to ensure that their meat was safe for human consumption. This was due to residual radioactivity from Chernobyl in the plants they graze on in the wild during the summer. 1,914 sheep needed to be given uncontaminated feed for a period of time before slaughter during 2012, and these sheep were located in just 18 of Norway's municipalities, a decrease of 17 from the 35 municipalities affected animals were located in during 2011 (117 municipalities were affected during 1986).&lt;ref name="thelocal1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.no/20130923/chernobyl-radiation-in-norway-sheep-hits-new-low |title=Record low number of radioactive sheep |first=Richard |last=Orange |date=23 September 2013 |newspaper=[[The Local]] |location=Norway |accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Devant OMS 5.jpg|thumb|267px|left|Demonstration on Chernobyl day near [[WHO]] in Geneva{{relevance inline|date=November 2017}}]]
In the aftermath of the accident, 237 people suffered from [[acute radiation sickness]], of whom 31 died within the first three months.&lt;ref name="Hallenbeck 1994 15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mould (2000), p. 29. "The number of deaths in the first three months were 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the [[Chernobyl Forum]], composed of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], other UN organizations and the governments of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, published a report on the radiological environmental and health consequences of the Chernobyl accident.

On the death toll of the accident, the report states that 28 emergency workers ("liquidators") died from [[acute radiation syndrome]], including [[beta burn]]s, and 15 patients died from thyroid cancer in the following years, and it roughly estimated that cancer deaths caused by Chernobyl may reach a total of about 4,000 among the 5&amp;nbsp;million persons residing in the contaminated areas. The report projected cancer mortality "increases of less than one per cent" (~0.3%) on a time span of 80 years, cautioning that this estimate was "speculative" since at this time only a few cancer deaths are linked to the Chernobyl disaster.&lt;ref name="ChernobylsLegacy"/&gt; The report says it is impossible to reliably predict the number of fatal cancers arising from the incident as small differences in assumptions can result in large differences in the estimated health costs. The report says it represents the consensus view of the eight UN organizations.

Of all 66,000 Belarusian emergency workers, by the mid-1990s only 150 (roughly 0.2%) were reported by their government as having died. In contrast, 5,722 casualties were reported among Ukrainian clean-up workers up to the year 1995, by the National Committee for Radiation Protection of the Ukrainian Population.&lt;ref name="MarplesDecade"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= |title=Holos Ukrainy |last=|first= |date=7 June 1995 |work=Holos Ukrainy |access-date= |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four most harmful radionuclides spread from Chernobyl were [[iodine-131]], [[caesium-134]], [[caesium-137]] and [[strontium-90]], with half-lives of 8.02 days, 2.07 years, 30.2 years and 28.8 years respectively.&lt;ref name="TORCH"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fairlie |first1=Ian |last2=Sumner |first2=David |title=The Other Report on Chernobyl (TORCH) |year=2006| location=Berlin |publisher=The European Greens}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} The iodine was initially viewed with less alarm than the other isotopes, because of its short half-life, but it is highly volatile, and now appears to have travelled furthest and caused the most severe health problems in the short term.&lt;ref name="MarplesDecade"/&gt;{{rp|24}} Strontium, on the other hand, is the least volatile of the four, and of main concern in the areas near Chernobyl itself.&lt;ref name="TORCH"/&gt;{{rp|8}} Iodine tends to become concentrated in thyroid and milk glands, leading, among other things, to increased incidence of thyroid cancers.

By the year 2000, the number of Ukrainians claiming to be radiation 'sufferers' (''poterpili'') and receiving state benefits had jumped to 3.5 million, or 5% of the population. Many of these are populations resettled from contaminated zones, or former or current Chernobyl plant workers.&lt;ref name="PetrynaLE"/&gt;{{rp|4–5}} According to [[IAEA]]-affiliated scientific bodies, these apparent increases of ill health result partly from economic strains on these countries and poor health-care and nutrition; also, they suggest that increased medical vigilance following the accident has meant that many cases that would previously have gone unnoticed (especially of cancer) are now being registered.&lt;ref name="MarplesDecade"/&gt;

Following the accident, [[journalist]]s mistrusted many medical professionals (such as the spokesman from the UK [[National Radiological Protection Board]]), and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them.&lt;ref name="kasperson160"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kasperson |first1=Roger E. |last2=Stallen |first2=Pieter Jan M. |title=Communicating Risks to the Public: International Perspectives |publisher=Springer Science and Media |year=1991 |location=Berlin |pages=160–162 |isbn=978-0-7923-0601-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the European continent, due to this media-driven framing of the slight contamination and in nations where [[abortion]] is legal, many requests for induced abortions, of otherwise normal pregnancies, were obtained out of fears of radiation from Chernobyl, including an excess number of abortions in Denmark in the months following the accident.&lt;ref name="Knudsen"/&gt; In Greece, following the accident many [[obstetrician]]s were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation. Although it was determined that the [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] to [[Greek people|Greeks]] would not exceed 1&amp;nbsp;[[Sievert|mSv]] (100&amp;nbsp;[[rem (unit)|mrem]]), a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other non-[[stochastic]] effects, there was an observed 2500 excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated, probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk.&lt;ref name="Trichopoulos"/&gt; A "slightly" above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in Italy.&lt;ref name="Parazzini"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perucchi"/&gt;

Worldwide, an estimated excess of about 150,000 [[elective abortion]]s may have been performed on otherwise healthy pregnancies out of [[radiophobia|unfounded fears of radiation]] from Chernobyl, according to Dr Robert Baker and ultimately a 1987 article published by Linda E.

Estimates of the number of deaths that will eventually result from the accident vary enormously; disparities reflect both the lack of solid scientific data and the different methodologies used to quantify mortality—whether the discussion is confined to specific geographical areas or extends worldwide, and whether the deaths are immediate, short term, or long term.

In 1994, [[Deaths due to the Chernobyl disaster|thirty-one deaths]] were directly attributed to the accident, all among the reactor staff and emergency workers.&lt;ref name="Hallenbeck 1994 15"&gt;{{cite book |title=Radiation Protection |last=Hallenbeck |first=William H. |isbn=978-0-87371-996-4 |publisher=CRC Press |year=1994 |quote=Reported thus far are 237 cases of acute radiation sickness and 31 deaths. |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 2008 report by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, and the total number of confirmed deaths from radiation was 64 and was expected to continue to rise.

The [[Chernobyl Forum]] predicts that the eventual death toll could reach 4,000 among those exposed to the ''highest levels of radiation'' (200,000 emergency workers, 116,000 evacuees and 270,000 residents of the most contaminated areas); this figure is a total [[causal]] death toll prediction, combining the deaths of approximately 50 emergency workers who died soon after the accident from [[acute radiation syndrome]], 15 children who have died of [[thyroid cancer]] and a future predicted total of 3935 deaths from radiation-induced cancer and leukaemia.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

In a [[peer-reviewed]] paper in the ''[[International Journal of Cancer]]'' in 2006, the authors expanded the discussion on those exposed to all of Europe (but following a different conclusion methodology to the Chernobyl Forum study, which arrived at the total predicted death toll of 4,000 after [[List of cancer mortality rates in the United States|cancer survival rates]] were factored in) they stated, without entering into a discussion on deaths, that in terms of total excess cancers attributed to the accident:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1002/ijc.22037 |pmid=16628547 |title=Estimates of the cancer burden in Europe from radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl accident |journal=International Journal of Cancer |volume=119 |issue=6 |pages=1224–35 |year=2006 |last1=Cardis |first1=Elisabeth |last2=Krewski |first2=Daniel |last3=Boniol |first3=Mathieu |last4=Drozdovitch |first4=Vladimir |last5=Darby |first5=Sarah C. |last6=Gilbert |first6=Ethel S.|author6-link=Ethel Gilbert |last7=Akiba |first7=Suminori |last8=Benichou |first8=Jacques |last9=Ferlay |first9=Jacques |last10=Gandini |first10=Sara |last11=Hill |first11=Catherine |last12=Howe |first12=Geoffrey |last13=Kesminiene |first13=Ausrele |last14=Moser |first14=Mirjana |last15=Sanchez |first15=Marie |last16=Storm |first16=Hans |last17=Voisin |first17=Laurent |last18=Boyle |first18=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Models predict that by 2065 about 16,000 cases of thyroid cancer and 25,000 cases of other cancers may be expected due to radiation from the accident, whereas several hundred million cancer cases are expected from other causes.}}

Two anti-nuclear advocacy groups have publicized non-peer-reviewed estimates that include mortality estimates for those who were exposed to even smaller amounts of radiation. The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS) calculated that, among the hundreds of millions of people exposed worldwide, there will be an eventual 50,000 excess cancer cases, resulting in 25,000 excess cancer deaths, excluding thyroid cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/chernobyl-cancer-death-toll-0536.html |title=Chernobyl Cancer Death Toll Estimate More Than Six Times Higher Than the 4000 Frequently Cited, According to a New UCS Analysis |date=22 April 2011 |website=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]] |access-date=8 November 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602031829/http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/chernobyl-cancer-death-toll-0536.html |archive-date=2 June 2011 |quote=The UCS analysis is based on radiological data provided by UNSCEAR, and is consistent with the findings of the Chernobyl Forum and other researchers.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these calculations are based on a simple [[linear no-threshold model]] multiplication and the misapplication of the [[collective dose]], which the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) states "should not be done" as using the collective dose is "inappropriate to use in risk projections".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/46/092/46092732.pdf |chapter=Imputability of Health Effects to Low-Dose Radiation Exposure Situations |last=González |first=Abel J. |page=5 |title=Nuclear Law in Progress |publisher=XXI AIDN/INLA Congress |location=Buenos Aires |date=2014 |access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along similar lines to the UCS approach, the 2006 [[TORCH report]], commissioned by the [[European Greens]] political party, likewise simplistically calculates an eventual 30,000 to 60,000 excess cancer deaths in total, around the globe.&lt;ref name=torch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chernobylreport.org/?p=summary |title=Torch: The Other Report On Chernobyl—executive summary |author=[[European Greens]] and UK scientists [[Ian Fairlie]] PhD and David Sumner |website=Chernobylreport.org |date=April 2006 |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fred Mettler, a radiation expert at the University of New Mexico, puts the number of worldwide cancer deaths outside the highly contaminated zone at "perhaps" 5000, for a total of 9000 Chernobyl-associated fatal cancers, saying "the number is small (representing a few percent) relative to the normal spontaneous risk of cancer, but the numbers are large in absolute terms".&lt;ref name="Mettler"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mettler |first=Fred |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull472/htmls/chernobyls_legacy2.html |title=Chernobyl's Legacy |journal=IAEA Bulletin |volume=47 |number=2 |accessdate=20 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805035918/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull472/htmls/chernobyls_legacy2.html |archivedate=5 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same report outlined studies based in data found in the Russian Registry from 1991 to 1998 that suggested that "of 61,000 Russian workers exposed to an average dose of 107 mSv about 5% of all fatalities that occurred may have been due to radiation exposure."&lt;ref name="ChernobylsLegacy"/&gt;

The report went into depth about the risks to [[mental health]] of exaggerated fears about the effects of radiation.&lt;ref name="ChernobylsLegacy"/&gt; According to the IAEA the "designation of the affected population as "victims" rather than "survivors" has led them to perceive themselves as helpless, weak and lacking control over their future". The IAEA says that this may have led to behaviour that has caused further health effects.&lt;ref name="IAEA-situation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/blog/Infolog/?page_id=25 |title=What's the situation at Chernobyl? |website=IAEA.org |accessdate=20 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828163959/http://www.iaea.org/blog/Infolog/?page_id=25 |archivedate=28 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fred Mettler commented that 20 years later: "The population remains largely unsure of what the effects of radiation actually are and retain a sense of foreboding. A number of adolescents and young adults who have been exposed to modest or small amounts of radiation feel that they are somehow fatally flawed and there is no downside to using illicit drugs or having unprotected sex. To reverse such attitudes and behaviours will likely take years although some youth groups have begun programs that have promise."&lt;ref name="Mettler"/&gt; In addition, disadvantaged children around Chernobyl suffer from health problems that are attributable not only to the Chernobyl accident, but also to the poor state of post-Soviet health systems.&lt;ref name="ChernobylsLegacy"/&gt;

The [[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]] (UNSCEAR), part of the Chernobyl Forum, have produced their own assessments of the radiation effects.&lt;ref name=UNSCEAR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/chernobyl.html |title=UNSCEAR assessment of the Chernobyl accident |website=United Nations Scientific Committee of the Effects of Atomic Radiation |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNSCEAR was set up as a collaboration between various United Nation bodies, including the [[World Health Organization]], after the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to assess the long-term effects of radiation on human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/about_us/history.html |title=Historical milestones |website=United Nations Scientific Committee of the Effects of Atomic Radiation |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deaths due to radiation exposure===
The number of potential deaths arising from the Chernobyl disaster is heavily debated. The [[WHO]]'s prediction of 4000 future cancer deaths in surrounding countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr20/en/index.html |title=World Health Organization report explains the health impacts of the world's worst-ever civil nuclear accident |date=26 April 2006 |website=World Health Organization |access-date=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the [[Linear no-threshold model]] (LNT), which assumes that the damage inflicted by radiation at low doses is directly proportional to the [[effective dose (radiation)|dose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2009.440 |title=Projected Cancer Risks from Computed Tomographic Scans Performed in the United States in 2007 |year=2009 |last1=Berrington De González |first1=Amy |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=169 |issue=22 |pages=2071–77 |pmid=20008689 |last2=Mahesh |first2=M |last3=Kim |first3=KP |last4=Bhargavan |first4=M |last5=Lewis |first5=R |last6=Mettler |first6=F |last7=Land |first7=C}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radiation epidemiologist]] Roy Shore contends that estimating health effects in a population from the LNT model "is not wise because of the uncertainties".&lt;ref name="Science 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.332.6032.908 |title=Fukushima Revives the Low-Dose Debate |year=2011 |last1=Normile |first1=D. |journal=Science |volume=332 |issue=6032 |pages=908–10 |pmid=21596968 |bibcode=2011Sci...332..908N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Union of Concerned Scientists the number of excess cancer deaths worldwide (including all contaminated areas) is approximately 27,000 based on the same LNT.&lt;ref name="Union of Concerned Scientists"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allthingsnuclear.org/post/4704112149/how-many-cancers-did-chernobyl-really-cause-updated |title=How Many Cancers Did Chernobyl Really Cause? |first=Lisbeth |last=Gronlund |date=17 April 2011 |website=Union of Concerned Scientists |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study critical of the Chernobyl Forum report was commissioned by Greenpeace, which asserted that the most recently published figures indicate that in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine the accident could have resulted in 10,000–200,000 additional deaths in the period between 1990 and 2004.&lt;ref name="greenpeace2006"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/planet-2/report/2006/4/chernobylhealthreport.pdf |title=The Chernobyl Catastrophe. Consequences on Human Health |year=2006 |website=[[Greenpeace]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scientific Secretary of the Chernobyl Forum criticized the report's reliance on non-[[peer review|peer-reviewed]] locally produced studies. Although most of the study's sources were from peer-reviewed journals, including many Western medical journals, the higher mortality estimates were from non-peer-reviewed sources,&lt;ref name="greenpeace2006"/&gt; while Gregory Härtl (spokesman for the WHO) suggested that the conclusions were motivated by ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Hawley |first1=Charles |last2=Schmitt |first2=Stefan |title=Greenpeace vs. the United Nations: The Chernobyl Body Count Controversy |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,411864,00.html |date=18 April 2006 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment]]'' is a 2007 Russian publication that concludes that there were 985,000 premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity released.&lt;ref name="Balonov"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Review 'Chernobyl: Consequences of the Disaster for the Population and the Environment' |first=M. I. |last=Balonov |url=http://www.nyas.org/asset.axd?id=8b4c4bfc-3b35-434f-8a5c-ee5579d11dbb&amp;t=634507382459270000 |journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |accessdate=15 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119125747/http://www.nyas.org/asset.axd?id=8b4c4bfc-3b35-434f-8a5c-ee5579d11dbb&amp;t=634507382459270000 |archivedate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results were criticized by M. I. Balonov of the Institute of Radiation Hygiene in St. Petersburg, who described them as biased, drawing from sources which were difficult to independently verify and lacking a proper scientific base. Balanov expressed his opinion that "the authors unfortunately did not appropriately analyze the content of the Russian-language publications, for example, to separate them into those that contain scientific evidence and those based on hasty impressions and ignorant conclusions".&lt;ref name="Balonov"/&gt;

==Speculation==
According to [[Kenneth Mossman]], a Professor of [[Health Physics]] and member of the [[U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] advisory committee,&lt;ref name="Mossman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sols.asu.edu/people/faculty/kmossman.php |title=Kenneth Mossman |website=ASU School of Life Sciences |access-date=8 November 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702130118/http://sols.asu.edu/people/faculty/kmossman.php |archive-date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "LNT philosophy is overly conservative, and low-level radiation may be less dangerous than commonly believed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1118/1.598208 |title=The linear no-threshold debate: Where do we go from here? |year=1998 |last1=Mossman |first1=Kenneth L. |journal=Medical Physics |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=279–84; discussion 300 |pmid=9547494 |bibcode=1998MedPh..25..279M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yoshihisa Matsumoto, a radiation biologist at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, cites laboratory experiments on animals to suggest there must be a threshold dose below which DNA repair mechanisms can completely repair any radiation damage.&lt;ref name="Science 2011"/&gt; Mossman suggests that the proponents of the current model believe that being conservative is justified due to the uncertainties surrounding low level doses and it is better to have a "prudent public health policy".&lt;ref name="Mossman"/&gt;

Another significant issue is establishing consistent data on which to base the analysis of the impact of the Chernobyl accident. Since 1991 large social and political changes have occurred within the affected regions and these changes have had significant impact on the administration of health care, on socio-economic stability, and the manner in which statistical data is collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ije/28.1.19 |title=Cancer mortality in Russia and Ukraine: Validity, competing risks and cohort effects |year=1999 |last1=Shkolnikov |first1=V. |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=28 |pages=19–29 |pmid=10195659 |last2=McKee |first2=M. |last3=Vallin |first3=J. |last4=Aksel |first4=E. |last5=Leon |first5=D. |last6=Chenet |first6=L |last7=Meslé |first7=F |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald Chesser, a radiation biologist at [[Texas Tech University]], says that "the subsequent Soviet collapse, scarce funding, imprecise dosimetry, and difficulties tracking people over the years have limited the number of studies and their reliability".&lt;ref name="Science 2011"/&gt;

==Economic and political consequences==
[[File:Улица Кирова, Чернобыль.jpg|thumb|267px|Abandoned buildings in Chernobyl]]
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in Ukraine 26 April 2011-4.jpeg|thumb|267px|right|Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev|Medvedev]] and Ukrainian President [[Viktor Yanukovych|Yanukovych]] lay wreaths at a memorial to victims of the Chernobyl disaster on 26 April 2011.]]

It is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster. According to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the Soviet Union spent 18 billion rubles (the equivalent of US$18 billion at that time) on containment and decontamination, virtually bankrupting itself.&lt;ref name="GorbachevBoC"/&gt; In Belarus the total cost over 30 years is estimated at US$235&amp;nbsp;billion (in 2005 dollars).&lt;ref name="ChernobylsLegacy"/&gt; Ongoing costs are well known; in their 2003–2005 report, [[The Chernobyl Forum]] stated that between 5% and 7% of government spending in Ukraine is still related to Chernobyl, while in Belarus over $13&amp;nbsp;billion is thought to have been spent between 1991 and 2003, with 22% of national budget having been Chernobyl-related in 1991, falling to 6% by 2002.&lt;ref name="ChernobylsLegacy"/&gt; Much of the current cost relates to the payment of Chernobyl-related social benefits to some 7&amp;nbsp;million people across the 3 countries.&lt;ref name="ChernobylsLegacy"/&gt;

A significant economic impact at the time was the removal of {{convert|784320|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of agricultural land and {{convert|694200|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of forest from production. While much of this has been returned to use, agricultural production costs have risen due to the need for special cultivation techniques, fertilizers and additives.&lt;ref name="ChernobylsLegacy"/&gt;

Politically, the accident gave great significance to the new Soviet policy of glasnost,&lt;ref name="ShlyGlasnost"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00139157.1992.9931445 |title=Chernobyl and Glasnost: The Effects of Secrecy on Health and Safety |year=1992 |last1=Shlyakhter |first1=Alexander |last2=Wilson |first2=Richard |journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development |volume=34 |issue=5 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PetrynaSarc"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/can.1995.10.2.02a00030 |title=Sarcophagus: Chernobyl in Historical Light |year=1995 |last1=Petryna |first1=Adriana |journal=Cultural Anthropology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=196–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped forge closer Soviet–US relations at the end of the Cold War, through bioscientific cooperation.&lt;ref name="PetrynaLE"/&gt;{{rp|44–48}} The disaster also became a key factor in the Union's eventual [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|1991 dissolution]], and a major influence in shaping the new [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name="PetrynaLE"/&gt;{{rp|20–21}}

Both Ukraine and Belarus, in their first months of independence, lowered legal radiation thresholds from the Soviet Union's previous, elevated thresholds (from 35 rems per lifetime under the USSR to 7 rems per lifetime in Ukraine and 0.1 rems per year in Belarus).&lt;ref name="MarplesBelarus"&gt;{{cite book |title=Belarus: From Soviet Rule to Nuclear Catastrophe |last=Marples |first=David R. |publisher=MacMillan Press |year=1996 |location=Basingstoke, Hampshire}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46–7,119–124}} This required an expansion of territories that were considered contaminated. In Ukraine, over 500,000 people have now been resettled, many of whom have become applicants for medical and other welfare. Ukraine also maintains the destroyed reactor, for which it employs a very large workforce in order to keep individual exposure times low. Many of these workers have since registered disabilities and enrolled for welfare. In Ukraine, the Chernobyl disaster was an icon of the nationalist movement, symbolic of all that was wrong with the Soviet Union, and welfare became a key platform for winning independence. Ukraine has since developed a massive and burdensome welfare system that has become increasingly corrupt and ineffective.&lt;ref name="PetrynaLE"/&gt;{{update after|2016|11|14}} It has presented its greatly increased welfare demands since 1991 as a demonstration of its own moral legitimacy, and as an argument for needing foreign aid.&lt;ref name="PetrynaLE"/&gt;{{rp|24}}{{update after|2016|11|14}} Belarus, on the other hand, was politically weak when it gained independence, and looked to Moscow for guidance; in many ways it has returned to the old Soviet policy of secrecy and denial.&lt;ref name="MarplesBelarus"/&gt;{{rp|46–7,119–124}}&lt;ref name="PetrynaLE"/&gt;{{rp|22–24}}{{better source|date=December 2017}}

==Aftermath==
Following the accident, questions arose about the future of the plant and its eventual fate. All work on the unfinished reactors 5 and 6 was halted three years later. However, the trouble at the Chernobyl plant did not end with the disaster in [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] 4. The damaged reactor was sealed off and {{convert|200|m3|yd3|-1|sp=us}} of concrete was placed between the disaster site and the operational buildings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The work was managed by [[Grigoriy Mihaylovich Naginskiy]], the deputy chief engineer of Installation and Construction Directorate – 90. The Ukrainian government continued to let the three remaining reactors operate because of an energy shortage in the country.

===Decommissioning===
{{Main|Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant#Decommissioning}}
In October 1991, a fire broke out in the turbine building of reactor 2;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/gen-comm/info-notices/1993/in93071.html |title=Information Notice No. 93–71: Fire At Chernobyl Unit 2 |date=13 September 1993 |website=Nuclear Regulatory Commission |accessdate=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authorities subsequently declared the reactor damaged beyond repair, and it was taken offline. Reactor 1 was decommissioned in November 1996 as part of a deal between the Ukrainian government and international organizations such as the IAEA to end operations at the plant. On 15 December 2000, then-President [[Leonid Kuchma]] personally turned off Reactor 3 in an official ceremony, shutting down the entire site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pris.iaea.org/pris/CountryStatistics/ReactorDetails.aspx?current=575 |title=Chernobyl-3 |website=IAEA Power Reactor Information System |access-date=8 November 2018}} Site polled in May 2008 reports shutdown for units 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively at 30 November 1996, 11 October 1991, 15 December 2000 and 26 April 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radioactive waste management===

====Containment of the reactor====
The Chernobyl reactor is now enclosed in a large concrete sarcophagus, which was built quickly to allow continuing operation of the other reactors at the plant.&lt;ref name="chornobyl.in.ua"/&gt;
[[File:NSC-Oct-2017.jpg|thumb|250px|right|New Safe Confinement in October 2017]]
A [[New Safe Confinement]] was to have been built by the end of 2005; however, it has suffered ongoing delays and {{as of|2010|lc=y}}, when construction finally began, was expected to be completed in 2013. This was delayed again to 2016, the end of the 30-year lifespan of the sarcophagus. The structure was built adjacent to the existing shelter and in November 2016 was slid into place on rails. It is a metal arch {{convert|105|m}} high and spanning {{convert|257|m}}, to cover both unit 4 and the hastily built 1986 structure. The [[Chernobyl Shelter Fund]], set up in 1997, has received [[Euro|€]]810 million from international donors and projects to cover this project and previous work. It and the Nuclear Safety Account, also applied to Chernobyl decommissioning, are managed by the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD).{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

{{as of|2016|November|29}}, Reactor No. 4 has been covered by the New Safe Confinement that covers the reactor and the unstable "sarcophagus".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster-site-covered-with-shelter-prevent-radiation-leaks-ukraine |title=Chernobyl disaster site enclosed by shelter to prevent radiation leaks |last=Walker |first=Shaun |date=29 November 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |issn=0261-3077 |access-date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The huge steel arch was moved into place over several weeks, and the completion of this procedure was celebrated with a ceremony at the site, attended by the Ukrainian president, [[Petro Poroshenko]], diplomats and site workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/world/europe/chernobyl-disaster-cover.html |title=Giant Arch, a Feat of Engineering, Now Covers Chernobyl Site in Ukraine |last1=Nechepurenko |first1=Ivan |last2=Fountain |first2=Henry |date=29 November 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the original sarcophagus, the New Safe Confinement is designed to allow the reactor to be safely dismantled using remotely operated equipment.

By 2002, roughly 15,000 Ukrainian workers were still working within the Zone of Exclusion, maintaining the plant and performing other containment- and research-related tasks, often in dangerous conditions.&lt;ref name="PetrynaLE"/&gt;{{rp|2}}
A handful of Ukrainian scientists work inside the sarcophagus, but outsiders are rarely granted access. In 2006 an Australian [[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|''60 Minutes'']] team led by reporter Richard Carleton and producer Stephen Rice were allowed to enter the sarcophagus for 15 minutes and film inside the control room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://video.au.msn.com/watch/video/return-to-chernobyl/xf09iii |title=Inside Chernobyl |website=60 Minutes Australia, Nine Network Australia |date=16 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 February 2013, a {{convert|600|m2|sqft|adj=on|abbr=on}} section of the roof of the turbine-building, adjacent to the sarcophagus, collapsed. At first it was assumed that the roof collapsed because of the weight of snow on it. However the amount of snow was not exceptional, and the report of a Ukrainian fact-finding panel concluded that the part collapse of the turbine-building was the result of sloppy repair work and aging of the structure. The report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the turbine-building added a larger strain on the total structure than expected, and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding. Experts such as Valentin Kupny, former deputy director of the nuclear plant, did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse, leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition. A proposed reinforcement in 2005 was cancelled by a superior official. After the 12 February incident, radioactivity levels were up to 19 becquerels per cubic meter of air: 12 times normal. The report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed. All 225 workers employed by the Chernobyl complex and the French company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse. According to the managers of the complex, radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels (between 5 and 6&amp;nbsp;µSv/h) and should not affect workers' health. According to Kupny the situation was underestimated by the Chernobyl nuclear complex managers, and information was kept secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Collapse of Chernobyl nuke plant building attributed to sloppy repair work, aging |url=http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130425p2a00m0na017000c.html |newspaper=[[Mainichi Shimbun]] |date=25 April 2013 |accessdate=26 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429110724/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130425p2a00m0na017000c.html |archivedate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21449760 |title=Ukraine: Chernobyl nuclear roof collapse 'no danger' |date=13 February 2013 |website=BBC News |access-date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radioactive materials and waste management====
{{As of|2006}}, some fuel remained in the reactors at units 1 through 3, most of it in each unit's [[spent fuel pool]], as well as some material in a small spent fuel interim storage facility pond (ISF-1).

In 1999 a contract was signed for construction of a [[radioactive waste]] management facility to store 25,000 used fuel assemblies from units 1–3 and other operational wastes, as well as material from decommissioning units 1–3 (which will be the first [[RBMK]] units decommissioned anywhere). The contract included a processing facility able to cut the RBMK fuel assemblies and to put the material in canisters, which were to be filled with [[inert gas]] and [[welded]] shut.

The canisters were to be transported to [[dry cask storage|dry storage vaults]], where the fuel containers would be enclosed for up to 100 years. This facility, treating 2500 fuel assemblies per year, would be the first of its kind for RBMK fuel. However, after a significant part of the storage structures had been built, technical deficiencies in the concept emerged, and the contract was terminated in 2007. The interim spent fuel storage facility (ISF-2) will now be completed by others by mid-2013.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Another contract has been let for a liquid radioactive waste treatment plant, to handle some 35,000 cubic meters of low- and intermediate-level liquid wastes at the site. This will need to be solidified and eventually buried along with solid wastes on site.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In January 2008, the Ukrainian government announced a 4-stage decommissioning plan that incorporates the above waste activities and progresses towards a cleared site.&lt;ref name="WNA-Chernobyl"/&gt;

====Lava-like fuel-containing materials (FCMs)====
{{Main|Corium (nuclear reactor)}}
According to official estimates, about 95% of the fuel in Reactor 4 at the time of the accident (about 180 [[metric ton]]s) remains inside the shelter, with a total radioactivity of nearly 18 million [[curie]]s (670&amp;nbsp;[[becquerel|PBq]]). The radioactive material consists of core fragments, dust, and lava-like "fuel containing materials" (FCM)—also called "[[Corium (nuclear reactor)|corium]]"—that flowed through the wrecked reactor building before hardening into a [[ceramic]] form.

Three different lavas are present in the basement of the reactor building: black, brown, and a [[porous]] ceramic. The lava materials are [[silicate glass]]es with [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] of other materials within them. The porous lava is brown lava that dropped into water and thus cooled rapidly.

It is unclear how long the ceramic form will retard the release of radioactivity. From 1997 to 2002 a series of published papers suggested that the self-irradiation of the lava would convert all 1,200&amp;nbsp;metric tons into a submicrometre and mobile powder within a few weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=V. |last=Baryakhtar |first2=V. |last2=Gonchar |first3=A. |last3=Zhidkov |first4=V. |last4=Zhidkov |title=Radiation damages and self-sputtering of high-radioactive dielectrics: spontaneous emission of submicronic dust particles |journal=Condensed Matter Physics |year=2002 |volume=5 |number=3{31} |pages=449–471 |url=http://www.icmp.lviv.ua/journal/zbirnyk.31/005/art05.pdf |doi=10.5488/cmp.5.3.449}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it has been reported that the degradation of the lava is likely to be a slow and gradual process rather than sudden and rapid.&lt;ref name="Borovoi2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10512-006-0079-3 |title=Nuclear fuel in the shelter |year=2006 |last1=Borovoi |first1=A. A. |journal=Atomic Energy |volume=100 |issue=4 |page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same paper states that the loss of [[uranium]] from the wrecked reactor is only {{convert|10|kg|lb|abbr=on}} per year; this low rate of uranium leaching suggests that the lava is resisting its environment.&lt;ref name="Borovoi2006"/&gt; The paper also states that when the shelter is improved, the leaching rate of the lava will decrease.&lt;ref name="Borovoi2006"/&gt;

Some of the surfaces of the lava flows have started to show new uranium minerals such as [[čejkaite]] ({{chem|Na|4|(UO|2|)(CO|3|)|3}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/min-7105.html |title=Čejkaite |website=[[Hudson Institute of Mineralogy]] |access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[uranyl carbonate]]. However, the level of radioactivity is such that during 100 years, the lava's self irradiation ({{val|2|e=16}} α&amp;nbsp;decays per gram and 2 to {{val|5|e=5|u=Gy}} of β or γ) will fall short of the level required to greatly change the properties of [[glass]] (10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; α decays per gram and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Gy of β or γ). Also the lava's rate of dissolution in water is very low (10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;·day&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), suggesting that the lava is unlikely to dissolve in water.&lt;ref name="Borovoi2006" /&gt;

===The Exclusion Zone===
{{Main|Chernobyl Exclusion Zone}}
[[File:Entrance to zone of alienation around Chernobyl.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|zone of alienation]] around Chernobyl]]
An area originally extending {{convert|30|km}} in all directions from the plant is officially called the "zone of alienation". It is largely uninhabited, except for about 300 residents who have refused to leave. The area has largely reverted to forest, and has been overrun by wildlife because of a lack of competition with humans for space and resources. Even today, radiation levels are so high that the workers responsible for rebuilding the sarcophagus are only allowed to work five hours a day for one month before taking 15 days of rest. Ukrainian officials estimated the area would not be safe for human life again for another 20,000 years&lt;ref name=TimeDisaster/&gt; (although by 2016, 187 local Ukrainians had returned and were living permanently in the zone&lt;ref name="Telegraph2016"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Oliphant|first1=Roland |title=30 years after Chernobyl disaster, wildlife is flourishing in radioactive wasteland |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/23/wildlife-returns-to-radioactive-wasteland-of-chernobyl/ |accessdate=27 April 2016 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In 2011 Ukraine opened up the sealed zone around the Chernobyl reactor to tourists who wish to learn more about the tragedy that occurred in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/12/13/ukraine-open-chernobyl-area-tourists-1172479551/ |title=Ukraine to Open Chernobyl Area to Tourists in 2011 |agency=Associated Press |date=13 December 2010 |website=Fox News |accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.travelsnitch.org/categories/features/tours-of-chernobyl-sealed-zone-officially-begin/ |title=Tours of Chernobyl sealed zone officially begin |date=18 March 2011 |website=TravelSnitch |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430053527/http://www.travelsnitch.org/categories/features/tours-of-chernobyl-sealed-zone-officially-begin/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; Sergii Mirnyi, a radiation reconnaissance officer at the time of the accident, and now an academic at [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]] in [[Kiev, Ukraine]], has written about the psychological and physical effects on survivors and visitors, and worked as an advisor to Chernobyl tourism groups.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Boyle |first1=Rebecca |title=Greetings from Isotopia |magazine=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=3 |pages=26–35 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/greetings-from-isotopia |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Digges"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Digges |first1=Charles |title=Reflections of a Chernobyl liquidator – the way it was and the way it will be |url=http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/accidents-and-incidents/2006-10-reflections-of-a-chernobyl-liquidator-the-way-it-was-and-the-way-it-will-be |accessdate=20 June 2018 |work=Bellona |date=4 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concern over forest fires===
{{see also|Polesie State Radioecological Reserve}}
During the dry seasons, a perennial concern is if the forests that have been contaminated by radioactive material catch on fire, then depending on the prevailing atmospheric conditions, the fires could potentially spread the radioactive material further outwards from the exclusion zone in the smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18721292 |title=Chernobyl's radioactive trees and the forest fire risk |website=BBC News |date=7 July 2012 |last1=Evans |first1=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/forests-around-chernobyl-arent-decaying-properly-180950075/ |title=Forests Around Chernobyl Aren’t Decaying Properly |first=Rachel |last=Nuwer |date=14 March 2014 |website=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Belarus, the [[Bellesrad]] organization is tasked with overseeing the food cultivation and forestry management in the area.

==Recovery projects==

===The Chernobyl Shelter Fund===
{{main|Chernobyl Shelter Fund|Chernobyl New Safe Confinement}}
The Chernobyl Shelter Fund was established in 1997 at the Denver [[23rd G8 summit]] to finance the Shelter Implementation Plan (SIP). The plan calls for transforming the site into an ecologically safe condition by means of stabilization of the sarcophagus followed by construction of a New Safe Confinement (NSC). While the original cost estimate for the SIP was US$768&amp;nbsp;million, the 2006 estimate was $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion. The SIP is being managed by a consortium of [[Bechtel]], [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]], and [[Électricité de France]], and conceptual design for the NSC consists of a movable arch, constructed away from the shelter to avoid high radiation, to be slid over the sarcophagus. The NSC was moved into position in November 2016 and is expected to be completed in late 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebrd.com/what-we-do/sectors/nuclear-safety/chernobyl-new-safe-confinement.html |title=Chernobyl's New Safe Confinement |website=[[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] |accessdate=26 October 2017 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the largest movable structure ever built.

===The United Nations Development Programme===
The [[United Nations Development Programme]] has launched in 2003 a specific project called the [[Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme]] (CRDP) for the recovery of the affected areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.undp.org.ua/?page=projects&amp;projects=14 |title=CRDP: Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme |website=United Nations Development Programme |accessdate=31 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704002250/http://www.undp.org.ua/?page=projects&amp;projects=14 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme was initiated in February 2002 based on the recommendations in the report on Human Consequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident. The main goal of the CRDP's activities is supporting the [[Government of Ukraine]] in mitigating long-term social, economic, and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. CRDP works in the four most Chernobyl-affected areas in Ukraine: [[Kyivska]], [[Zhytomyr Oblast|Zhytomyrska]], [[Chernihiv Oblast|Chernihivska]] and [[Rivnenska]].

===The International Project on the Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident===
The International Project on the Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident (IPEHCA) was created and received [[US $]]20&amp;nbsp;million, mainly from Japan, in hopes of discovering the main cause of health problems due to &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I radiation. These funds were divided among Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, the three main affected countries, for further investigation of health effects. As there was significant corruption in former Soviet countries, most of the foreign aid was given to Russia, and no positive outcome from this money has been demonstrated.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Chernobyl Children International===
[[Chernobyl Children International]] (CCI) is a [[United Nations]]-accredited,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[non-profit]], international development, medical, and humanitarian organization that works with children, families and communities that continue to be affected by the economic outcome of the Chernobyl accident. The organization's founder and chief executive is [[Adi Roche]]. The CCI was founded in 1991 in response to an appeal from [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarus]]ian doctors for aid. Roche then began organizing 'rest and recuperation' holidays for a few Chernobyl children. Recruiting Irish families who would welcome and care for them, CCI expanded into the [[United States]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=bbcroche&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/12750.stm |title=Adi Roche - the early favourite |date=29 October 1997 |website=BBC News |access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wcahon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldofchildren.org/honoree/adi-roche/ |title=Honoree: Adi Roche |date=2015 |website=World of Children.org |access-date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It works closely with the Belarusian government, the [[United Nations]], and many thousands of volunteers worldwide to deliver a broad range of economic supports to the children and the wider community. It also acts as an advocate for the rights of those affected by the Chernobyl explosion, and engages in research{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} and outreach activities to encourage the rest of the world to remember the victims and understand the long-term impact on their lives.&lt;ref name=bbcroche/&gt;&lt;ref name=wcahon/&gt;

==Commemoration==

[[File:1996 Chernobyl, Ukraine commemorative coin - 200,000 Karbovanets.png|thumb|200,000 [[karbovanets]] coin issued by the [[National Bank of Ukraine]] to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster]]

''The Front Veranda'' (1986), a lithograph by [[Susan Dorothea White]] in the [[National Gallery of Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susandwhite.com.au/drawings_prints/1986frontver.html |title=''The Front Veranda'' (1986) |website=Susandwhite.com.au |accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; exemplifies worldwide awareness of the event. ''Heavy Water: A Film for Chernobyl'' was released by [[Seventh Art Productions|Seventh Art]] in 2006 to commemorate the disaster through poetry and first-hand accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moviemail-online.co.uk/scripts/article.pl?articleID=308 |title=Processing the Dark: 'Heavy Water&amp;nbsp;– A Film for Chernobyl' |website=Movie Mail UK |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film secured the Best Short Documentary at [[Cinequest Film Festival]] as well as the Rhode Island "best score" award&lt;ref name="atomictv"&gt;{{cite web |title=Heavy Water: A film for Chernobyl |url=http://www.atomictv.com/heavywater.html |website=AtomicTV.com |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a screening at Tate Modern.&lt;ref name="atomictv"/&gt;

[[Chernobyl Way]] is an annual rally run on 26 April by the opposition in Belarus as a remembrance of the Chernobyl disaster.

==Cultural impact==
{{main|Cultural impact of the Chernobyl disaster|Nuclear power debate}}

The Chernobyl accident attracted a great deal of interest. Because of the distrust that many people (both within and outside the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]) had in the Soviet authorities, a great deal of debate about the situation at the site occurred in the [[First World]] during the early days of the event. Because of defective [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] based on [[satellite imagery|photographs taken from space]], it was thought that unit number three had also suffered a dire accident.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Journalists mistrusted many professionals (such as the spokesman from the UK [[NRPB]]), and they in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them.&lt;ref name="kasperson160"/&gt;

In Italy, the Chernobyl accident was reflected in the outcome of the [[Italian nuclear power referendum, 1987|1987 referendum]]. As a result of that referendum, Italy began phasing out its nuclear power plants in 1988, a decision that was effectively [[Nuclear power in Italy|reversed in 2008]]. A [[Italian referendums, 2011#Nuclear power|referendum in 2011]] reiterated Italians' strong objections to nuclear power, thus abrogating the government's decision of 2008.

In Germany, the Chernobyl accident led to the creation of a federal environment ministry, after several states had already created such a post. The minister was given the authority over reactor safety as well, which the current minister still holds {{as of|2015|lc=y}}. The events are also credited with strengthening the anti-nuclear power movement, which culminated in the decision to end the use of nuclear power that was made by the 1998–2005 Schröder government.

The '''China-EU Institute for Clean and Renewable Energy at Huazhong University of Science &amp; Technology''' ('''CE-ICARE'''; {{zh|华中科技大学中欧清洁与可再生能源学院}}) is an education and research institute located in [[Wuhan]], [[China]], created in July 2010 and hosted in [[Huazhong University of Science and Technology]]. ICARE is the third Sino-European institute being created in China after the China-EU International Business School &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceibs.edu China-EU International Business School (CEIBS)]&lt;/ref&gt; in Shanghai in 1994 (as China-EC Management Institute) and the China-EU School of Law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesl.edu.cn China-EU School of Law (CESL)]&lt;/ref&gt; in Beijing in 2008. ICARE project has a 5-year funding from EU and Chinese government.

The creation of ICARE follows an agreement signed in 2009 by European Commissioner for External Relations [[Benita Ferrero-Waldner]] and Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade GAO Hucheng in the frame of the collaboration between China and Europe for environmental protection and climate change mitigation.

ICARE mission is to support China in implementing activities in management and technology in order to reduce the consumption of fossil energy and carbon emissions through renewable energies and energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.master-clean-renewable-energy.eu/en/page/wrapperEditoFichier/id_fichier/14 Education a weapon in fight against record pollution in University World News]&lt;/ref&gt;

==ICARE ==
ICARE is providing education to university students as well as to Chinese professionals and as the strong will to become the reference institute on [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and [[renewable energy in China]].

==Programmes offered==

===Master degree in Clean and Renewable Energy===
It is a Double master's degree Programme, namely, the master programme of energy science and technology conferred by Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in China, and the master programme of clean and renewable energy granted by ParisTech ([http://www.master-clean-renewable-energy.eu/en/article/43/43-en-general-informatio CARE]), for students who already have a degree in engineering or in another relevant scientific discipline in areas where there is a strong need for additional qualified workforce in China. Courses are taught in English by European and Chinese teachers, all experts in their fields. Main subjects are Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Biomass, Geothermal, Hydrogen and Energy Storage and Energy Efficiency. There is a six-month training period in laboratories in China or in Europe which allows the students to put into practice skills and knowledge acquired during courses. Presently 160 students are following the Master courses. First class was graduated (Master from ParisTech and Master from HuaZhong University) on March 15, 2013.

===Vocational training (VT) for energy professionals===
To meet the needs of domestic and international companies for professional training of their staff (decision makers, engineers, etc.) on CRE, ICARE aims at developing a VT platform. Tailored professional programmes are developed by European partners or associated partners. First sessions were held during three days in January 2013 on Photovoltaic energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icare.hust.edu.cn/en/index.php/Index/detail/id/103/navigate/24 EU-funded advanced training course on solar photovoltaic technology] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130407151533/http://icare.hust.edu.cn/en/index.php/Index/detail/id/103/navigate/24 |date=2013-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research Platform==
A Research Platform (RP) is developed to facilitate exchange of Ph.D. students between European and Chinese universities and co-supervision of research activities. RP is also a contact facilitator between European professors, during their teaching stays in ICARE, and Chinese professors to meet and develop common research projects. Every year top specialists in CREN fields are delivering conferences at ICARE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Conferences_at_ICARE_2012-2013.pdf  Conferences at ICARE 2012-2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''composite boson''' is a bound state of [[Fermion]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s such that the combination gives a boson. Some examples are: [[Cooper pair]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[meson]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, Superfluid helium, [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, Atomic bosons, and many other composite quantum states like [[Fermionic condensate]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. A composite particle containing an even number of fermions is a boson, since it has integer spin. These composite particle states have a symmetric [[wave function]] upon exchange of any pair of particles. The wave function is given by the [[permanent (mathematics)|permanent]] of single particle states for the non interacting case.

In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], especially the study of [[mechanics]] and [[fluid dynamics]], the '''d'Alembert-Euler condition''' is a requirement that the [[streakline]]s of a flow are [[irrotational]].  Let '''x'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''x'''('''X''',''t'') be the coordinates of the point '''x''' into which '''X''' is carried at time ''t'' by a (fluid) flow.  Let &lt;math&gt;\ddot{\mathbf{x}}=\frac{D^2\mathbf{x}}{Dt}&lt;/math&gt; be the second [[material derivative]] of '''x'''.  Then the d'Alembert-Euler condition is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{curl}\  \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The d'Alembert-Euler condition is named for [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and [[Leonhard Euler]] who independently first described its use in the mid-18th century.  It is not to be confused with the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations|Cauchy–Riemann conditions]].

'''SustainableEnergy''' (VedvarendeEnergi) which was called Danish Organisation for Renewable Energy (OVE) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ove.org/ The Danish Organisation for Renewable Energy (OVE) (In Danish: Organisationen for Vedvarende Energi (OVE)]&lt;/ref&gt;  until 2010, is a [[non-governmental]], [[non-profit]], membership based association. SustainableEnergy was founded in 1975 based on a popular movement for [[renewable energy]] in [[Denmark]] with close relationship to the [[anti-nuclear]] movement (OOA), which had an immense popular backup.

== Aim ==
SustainableEnergy’s aim is to work for a resource- and environment-conscious energy policy through grassroots initiatives to reach 100% [[renewable energy]] supply in Denmark by 2030.

== Objectives ==
SustainableEnergy has a strong engagement:
* to influence the development of the Danish [[energy policy]] to be more resource- and [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]-conscious especially by facilitating the use of [[renewable energy]].
* to get the people informed of their possibilities to make their own action by installing renewable-energy systems in their own homes or institutions in Denmark.

== Structure ==
'''Members:''' - Danish individuals who are users of renewable energy, as well as of groups, high schools, and companies working for renewable energy in Denmark. A special category of the members are the local Energy and Environment Offices, local popular information centers. In total, SustainableEnergy has about 2500 members.

'''Decisions:''' - SustainableEnergy's main decisions are made at the yearly General Assembly of the members and the bimonthly Board Meetings. The Members of the Board is elected at the General Assembly. The Chairman is elected by the Board.

'''Information:''' - The members are informed through a bimonthly magazine, in several subject-specific meetings, and a web site.

== Activities in Denmark ==

'''Political Lobbying'''
* Seeking to be represented in the energy related law and regulation formulating processes through hearings and committees.
* Evaluating and producing policy and campaign papers on renewable energy issues.

'''Information Dissemination'''
* Publishing a Danish bi-monthly magazine "Renewable Energy and Environment" (In Danish: ''Vedvarende Energi &amp; Miljø'' for the members.
* Offering a homepage with keys to literature, demonstration plants, companies and other relevant sites on the internet in Danish.
* Promoting information campaigns and giving advice in a close co-operation with the offices of  “Energy Services” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energitjenesten.dk Energy Services homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; and “Local Energy and Environmental Offices (SEK)” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sek.dk Local Energy and Environmental Offices (SEK)'s homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., the  "Campaign for converting houses from electric heating systems into more environmental friendly energy sources like renewable energy" or Energy efficient windows”.
* Involved in the Schools Energy Forum (SEF) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sef.dk School Energy Forum's (SEF) homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to implement more and better education on energy and environmental matters. Through SEF, SustainableEnergy is partner to the Climate Caravan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klimakaravanen.dk Climate Caravan’s homepage (In Danish: Klimakaravanen)]&lt;/ref&gt; which is offering educational possibilities in the schools in 98 municipalities of Denmark.
* Organising seminars, meetings at which technicians and users share knowledge and experiences. The main topics discussed are wind power, solar energy, biogas, energy efficiency, and renewable energy in green cities, along with integration of renewable energy into energy systems such as those for local cogeneration of heat and power.

== Cooperation in Denmark ==
SustainableEnergy has gone into co-operation with many other organisations interested in energy in Denmark. Among others:
* SustainableEnergy’s bi-monthly magazine is published in cooperation with National Association for Organic Building &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lob.dk National Association for Organic Building (In Danish: Landsforeningen Økologisk Byggeri) (LØB)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Association of Energy Offices (SEK).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sek.dk Association of Energy Offices(SEK)'s homepage (In Danish: Samvirkende Energi- og Miljøforeninger)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* SustainableEnergy is one of the 20 members of the Danish 92-Group (In Danish: ''92-gruppen'') where Danish environment and development organisations are cooperating since the UNCED Conference preparations in 1992. E.g., OVE was made a Climate Campaign in 2002 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klimakampagne.dk Climate Campaign’s homepage, (In Danish: Klimakampagne)]&lt;/ref&gt; in cooperation with [[Greenpeace]]-Danmark, [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]-Denmark, Nature and Youth (in Danish: Natur og Ungdom), The Ecological Council (in Danish: Økologisk Råd), and FEU.

== Cooperation internationally ==
* SustainableEnergy is active in projects in Europe, Asia and Africa to defend environment and decrease poverty. SustainableEnergy has or has had projects in Thailand, Vietnam, Mozambique, Mongolia and in South Africa in co-operation with local NGOs.

SustainableEnergy plays a significant role in international networking among NGOs. SustainableEnergy is member of:
* [[INFORSE-Europe]], [[International Network for Sustainable Energy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inforse.org/europe/ INFORSE-Europe’s homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; a NGO network with its International Secretariat based in Denmark, and with 7 Regional Co-ordinators in different continents. (&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inforse.org INFORSE's homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;). SustainableEnergy is one of the founders of [[INFORSE]] in 1992.

{{infobox darmstadtium}}
'''Darmstadtium''' is a synthetic [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Ds''' and [[atomic number]] 110. It is an extremely [[radioactive]] [[synthetic element]]. The most stable known [[isotope]], darmstadtium-281, has a [[half-life]] of approximately 10&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;ref name="04Og01"/&gt; Darmstadtium was first created in 1994 by the [[GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research]] near the city of [[Darmstadt]], Germany, after which it was named.

In the [[periodic table]], it is a [[d-block]] [[transactinide element]]. It is a member of the [[period 7 element|7th period]] and is placed in the [[group 10 element]]s, although no chemical experiments have yet been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to [[platinum]] in group 10 as the eighth member of the 6d series of [[transition metal]]s. Darmstadtium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, [[nickel]], [[palladium]], and platinum.

==History==
[[File:Luisenplatz.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The city center of [[Darmstadt]], the namesake of darmstadtium]]

===Discovery===
Darmstadtium was [[discovery of the chemical elements|first created]] on November 9, 1994, at the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung|Institute for Heavy Ion Research]] (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung, GSI) in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]], by [[Peter Armbruster]] and [[Gottfried Münzenberg]], under the direction of [[Sigurd Hofmann]]. The team bombarded a [[lead]]-208 target with accelerated nuclei of [[nickel-62]] in a heavy ion accelerator and detected a single atom of the isotope darmstadtium-269:&lt;ref name=95Ho01&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01291181|title=Production and decay of &lt;sup&gt;269&lt;/sup&gt;110|year=1995

In the same series of experiments, the same team also carried out the reaction using heavier nickel-64 ions. During two runs, 9 atoms of &lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;Ds were convincingly detected by correlation with known daughter decay properties:&lt;ref name=98Ho01&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0034-4885/61/6/002|date=1998|author=Hofmann, S|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|volume=61|page=639|bibcode = 1998RPPh...61..639H|title=New elements – approaching|issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this, there had been failed synthesis attempts in 1986–7 at the [[JINR|Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Dubna]] (then in the [[Soviet Union]]) and in 1990 at the GSI; a 1995 attempt at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] resulted in signs suggesting but not pointing conclusively at the discovery of a new isotope &lt;sup&gt;267&lt;/sup&gt;Ds formed in the bombardment of &lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi with &lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;Co, and a similarly inconclusive 1994 attempt at the JINR showed signs of &lt;sup&gt;273&lt;/sup&gt;Ds being produced from &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Pu and &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S. Each team proposed its own name for element 110: the American team proposed ''hahnium'' after [[Otto Hahn]] in an attempt to resolve the situation on [[dubnium|element 105]] (which they had long been suggesting this name for), the Russian team proposed ''becquerelium'' after [[Henri Becquerel]], and the German team proposed ''darmstadtium'' after Darmstadt, the location of their institute.&lt;ref name=93TWG&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1351/pac199365081757|title=Discovery of the transfermium elements.

===Naming===
[[File:Darmstadtium official naming ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|Ceremony conducted at the GSI for the official naming of darmstadtium on 2 December 2003]]
Using [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements]], darmstadtium should be known as ''eka-[[platinum]]''. In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called ''ununnilium'' (with the corresponding symbol of ''Uun''),&lt;ref name=iupac&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chatt, J.|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|date=1979|volume=51|pages=381–384|title=Recommendations for the naming of elements of atomic numbers greater than 100|doi=10.1351/pac197951020381|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[systematic element name]] as a [[placeholder name|placeholder]], until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who called it "element 110", with the symbol of ''E110'', ''(110)'' or even simply ''110''.&lt;ref name="Haire"/&gt;

In 1996, the Russian team proposed the name ''becquerelium'' after [[Henri Becquerel]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20050117160457/http://element114.narod.ru/110-history.html&lt;/ref&gt; The American team in 1997 proposed the name ''hahnium''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=yP63CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA397&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;dq=element+110+hahnium#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Transuranium People, The: The Inside Story| isbn=9781783262441| last1=Albert| first1=Ghiorso| last2=Darleane| first2=Hoffman C| last3=Glenn| first3=Seaborg T| date=2000-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Otto Hahn]] (previously this name had been used for [[dubnium|element 105]]).

The name ''darmstadtium'' (Ds) was suggested by the GSI team in honor of the city of Darmstadt, where the element was discovered.&lt;ref name="IUPAC-Ds"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoiX"/&gt; The GSI team originally also considered naming the element ''wixhausium'', after the suburb of Darmstadt known as [[Wixhausen]] where the element was discovered, but eventually decided on ''darmstadtium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/podcast/interactive_periodic_table_transcripts/darmstadtium.asp |title=Chemistry in its element – darmstadtium |website=Chemistry in its element |publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new name was officially recommended by [[IUPAC]] on August 16, 2003.&lt;ref name="IUPAC-Ds"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corish |first1=J. |last2=Rosenblatt |first2=G.

==Isotopes==
:''For a detailed list of information on the discovery of each individual darmstadtium isotope, see [[isotopes of darmstadtium]]''.
Darmstadtium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Nine different isotopes of darmstadtium have been reported with atomic masses 267, 269–271, 273, 277, and 279–281, although darmstadtium-267 and darmstadtium-280 are unconfirmed. Two darmstadtium isotopes, darmstadtium-270 and darmstadtium-271, have known [[metastable state]]s. Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay, but some undergo spontaneous fission.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;

===Stability and half-lives===
All darmstadtium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive; in general, the heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter. The most stable known darmstadtium isotope, &lt;sup&gt;281&lt;/sup&gt;Ds, is also the heaviest known darmstadtium isotope; it has a half-life of 11&amp;nbsp;seconds. The isotope &lt;sup&gt;279&lt;/sup&gt;Ds has a half-life of 0.18&amp;nbsp;seconds respectively. The remaining six isotopes and two metastable states have half-lives between 1&amp;nbsp;microsecond and 70&amp;nbsp;milliseconds.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt; Some unknown isotopes in this region, such as &lt;sup&gt;272&lt;/sup&gt;Ds and &lt;sup&gt;274–276&lt;/sup&gt;Ds, are predicted to also have rather long half-lives of a few seconds.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt;&lt;ref name=periodictable/&gt; Before its discovery, &lt;sup&gt;277&lt;/sup&gt;Ds was predicted to have a half-life of around 5&amp;nbsp;seconds, but it has since been found to have a half-life of only 5.7&amp;nbsp;milliseconds.&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt; Likewise, while &lt;sup&gt;280&lt;/sup&gt;Ds was originally predicted to have a half-life of about 11&amp;nbsp;seconds, 2015 work that may have detected it as the [[electron capture|electron-capture]] daughter of &lt;sup&gt;280&lt;/sup&gt;Rg has found for it a half-life of much less than a second,&lt;ref name=xxx&gt;http://xxx.lanl.gov/pdf/1502.03030.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and studies in 2014 and 2016 finding it as the possible alpha daughter of &lt;sup&gt;284&lt;/sup&gt;Cn found a half-life of about 6.7&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name=Kaji&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaji |first1=Daiya |last2=Morita |first2=Kosuke |first3=Kouji |last3=Morimoto |first4=Hiromitsu |last4=Haba |first5=Masato |last5=Asai |first6=Kunihiro |last6=Fujita |first7=Zaiguo |last7=Gan |first8=Hans |last8=Geissel |first9=Hiroo |last9=Hasebe |first10=Sigurd |last10=Hofmann |first11=MingHui |last11=Huang |first12=Yukiko |last12=Komori |first13=Long |last13=Ma |first14=Joachim |last14=Maurer |first15=Masashi |last15=Murakami |first16=Mirei |last16=Takeyama |first17=Fuyuki |last17=Tokanai |first18=Taiki |last18=Tanaka |first19=Yasuo |last19=Wakabayashi |first20=Takayuki |last20=Yamaguchi |first21=Sayaka |last21=Yamaki |first22=Atsushi |last22=Yoshida |date=2017 |title=Study of the Reaction &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca + &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm → &lt;sup&gt;296&lt;/sup&gt;Lv* at RIKEN-GARIS |journal=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=034201–1–7 |doi=10.7566/JPSJ.86.034201 |bibcode=2017JPSJ...86c4201K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predicted properties==

===Chemical===
Darmstadtium is the eighth member of the 6d series of [[transition metals]]. Since [[copernicium]] (element 112) has been shown to be a [[group 12 element|group 12]] metal, it is expected that all the elements from [[rutherfordium|104]] to [[roentgenium|111]] would continue a fourth transition metal series, with darmstadtium as part of the [[platinum group metal]]s&lt;ref name="DoiX"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1595/147106708X297486|title=The Periodic Table and the Platinum Group Metals|date=2008|last1=Griffith|first1=W. P.|journal=Platinum Metals Review|volume=52|issue=2|pages=114–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[noble metal]].&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; Calculations on its [[ionization potential]]s and [[atomic radius|atomic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] are similar to that of its lighter homologue [[platinum]], thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other [[group 10 element]]s, [[nickel]], [[palladium]], and platinum.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

Prediction of the probable chemical properties of darmstadtium has not received much attention recently. Darmstadtium is expected to be a [[noble metal]]. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 10 elements, the most stable oxidation states of darmstadtium are predicted to be the +6, +4, and +2 states; however, the neutral state is predicted to be the most stable in [[aqueous solution]]s. In comparison, only palladium and platinum are known to show the maximum oxidation state in the group, +6, while the most stable states are +4 and +2 for both nickel and palladium. It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from [[bohrium]] (element 107) to darmstadtium (element 110) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; Darmstadtium hexafluoride (DsF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) is predicted to have very similar properties to its lighter homologue [[platinum hexafluoride]] (PtF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), having very similar electronic structures and ionization potentials.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosen |first1=A. |last2=Fricke |first2=B. |last3=Morovic |first3=T. |last4=Ellis |first4=D.

===Physical and atomic===
Darmstadtium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the [[body-centered cubic]] structure, unlike its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congeners]] which crystallize in the [[face-centered cubic]] structure, because it is expected to have different electron charge densities from them.&lt;ref name=bcc/&gt; It should be a very heavy metal with a [[density]] of around 34.8&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, [[osmium]], has a density of only 22.61&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; This results from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the [[lanthanide contraction|lanthanide and actinide contractions]], and [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

The outer [[electron configuration]] of darmstadtium is calculated to be 6d&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which obeys the [[Aufbau principle]] and does not follow platinum's outer electron configuration of 5d&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This is due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electron pair over the whole seventh period, so that none of the elements from 104 to 112 are expected to have electron configurations violating the Aufbau principle. The atomic radius of darmstadtium is expected to be around 132&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;

==Experimental chemistry==
Unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of darmstadtium has yet to have been established&lt;ref name="Düllmann"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Düllmann |first1=Christoph E. |date=2012 |title=Superheavy elements at GSI: a broad research program with element 114 in the focus of physics and chemistry |journal=Radiochimica Acta |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=67–74 |doi=10.1524/ract.2011.1842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the short half-lives of darmstadtium isotopes and a limited number of likely volatile compounds that could be studied on a very small scale. One of the few darmstadtium compounds that are likely to be sufficiently volatile is darmstadtium hexafluoride ({{chem|DsF|6}}), as its lighter homologue platinum hexafluoride ({{chem|PtF|6}}) is volatile above 60&amp;nbsp;°C and therefore the analogous compound of darmstadtium might also be sufficiently volatile;&lt;ref name="DoiX" /&gt; a volatile octafluoride ({{chem|DsF|8}}) might also be possible.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; For chemical studies to be carried out on a [[transactinide element|transactinide]], at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1&amp;nbsp;second, and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week.&lt;ref name="DoiX"/&gt; Even though the half-life of &lt;sup&gt;281&lt;/sup&gt;Ds, the most stable confirmed darmstadtium isotope, is 11&amp;nbsp;seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of darmstadtium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the darmstadtium isotopes and have automated systems experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of darmstadtium, as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements; some of the separation techniques used for bohrium and [[hassium]] could be reused. However, the experimental chemistry of darmstadtium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from [[copernicium]] to [[livermorium]].&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;&lt;ref name="Düllmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eichler&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eichler |first=Robert |date=2013 |title=First foot prints of chemistry on the shore of the Island of Superheavy Elements|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1212/1212.4292.pdf|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|volume=420|issue=1 |pages=012003 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/420/1/012003|accessdate=11 September 2014|arxiv = 1212.4292 |bibcode = 2013JPhCS.420a2003E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more [[neutron]]-rich darmstadtium isotopes are the most stable&lt;ref name=nuclidetable/&gt; and are thus more promising for chemical studies;&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoiX" /&gt; however, they can only be produced indirectly from the alpha decay of heavier elements.&lt;ref name="04Og01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="277Ds"/&gt;&lt;ref name="279Ds"/&gt; and indirect synthesis methods are not as favourable for chemical studies as direct synthesis methods.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt; The more neutron-rich isotopes &lt;sup&gt;276&lt;/sup&gt;Ds and &lt;sup&gt;277&lt;/sup&gt;Ds might be produced directly in the reaction between [[thorium]]-232 and [[calcium-48]], but the yield is expected to be low.&lt;ref name=Haire/&gt;&lt;ref name="280Ds"&gt;[http://www1.jinr.ru/Reports/Reports_eng_arh.html Flerov lab annual report 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FengHotFusion&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=0803.1117|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2008.11.003|title=Production of heavy and superheavy nuclei in massive fusion reactions|date=2009|author=Feng, Z|journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=816|issue=1|page=33|last2=Jin|first2=G.|last3=Li|first3=J.|last4=Scheid|first4=W.|bibcode = 2009NuPhA.816...33F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, this reaction has already been tested without success,&lt;ref name="280Ds"/&gt; and more recent experiments that have successfully synthesized &lt;sup&gt;277&lt;/sup&gt;Ds using indirect methods show that it has a short half-life of 5.7&amp;nbsp;ms, not long enough to perform chemical studies.&lt;ref name="277Ds"/&gt; The only known darmstadtium isotope with a half-lifelong enough for chemical research is &lt;sup&gt;281&lt;/sup&gt;Ds, which would have to be produced as the granddaughter of &lt;sup&gt;289&lt;/sup&gt;Fl.&lt;ref name=Moody&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Synthesis of Superheavy Elements |last1=Moody |first1=Ken |editor1-first=Matthias |editor1-last=Schädel |editor2-first=Dawn |editor2-last=Shaughnessy |title=The Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |edition=2nd |pages=24–8 |isbn=9783642374661|date=2013-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dazzler''' is a [[non-lethal force|non-lethal]] weapon which uses intense [[directed-energy weapon|directed radiation]] to temporarily disable its target with [[flash blindness]]. Targets can include sensors or human vision.

Initially developed for military use, non-military products are becoming available for use in law enforcement and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/us-cops-and-military-to-get-laser-guns-602983 |title=US cops and military to get laser guns |date=27 May 2009 |author=Mark Harris |publisher=[[Techradar.com]] |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20011548-71.html |title=Police to experiment with blinding 'Dazer Laser'? |author=Chris Matyszczyk |date=23 July 2010 |publisher=[[CNET]].com |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

Dazzlers emit [[infrared]] or invisible light against various electronic sensors, and [[visible light]] against humans, when they are intended to cause no long-term damage to [[eye]]s. The emitters are usually [[laser]]s, making what is termed a ''laser dazzler''. Most of the contemporary systems are man-portable, and operate in either the red (a [[laser diode]]) or green (a [[diode-pumped solid-state laser]], DPSS) areas of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The green laser is chosen for its unique ability to react with the human eye. The green laser is less harmful to human eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998SPIE.3575...26K Green laser dazzler]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Some [[searchlight]]s are bright enough to cause permanent or temporary blindness, and they were used to dazzle the crews of bombers during [[World War II]]. Whirling Spray was a system of search lights fitted with rotating mirrors which was used to dazzle and confuse pilots attacking the Suez canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/R/real_lives/jasper.html |title=Real Lives: Magic at War |last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Channel 4]] |doi= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was developed into the [[Canal Defence Light]], a small mobile tank mounted system intended for use in the [[Operation Plunder|Rhine crossings]]. However, the system was mainly used as conventional searchlights.

[[Handgun]] or rifle-mounted lights may also be used to temporarily blind an opponent and are sometimes marketed for that purpose. In both cases the primary purpose is to illuminate the target and their use to disorient is secondary.

[[File:Dazzler mounted on M-240B in Iraq.jpg|thumb|A Green Laser Dazzler attached to a [[M240B]] during the [[Iraq War]].]]

The first reported use of laser dazzlers in [[combat]] was possibly by the [[United Kingdom|British]], during the [[Falklands War]] of 1982, when they were reputedly fitted to various [[Royal Navy]] warships to hinder low-level [[Argentina|Argentinian]] air attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/rn/frigates/t22/|title=Type 22 frigates|work=Haze Gray &amp; Underway website|accessdate=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/buzz/stories/s773141.htm |title=The Buzz 27 January 2003 - Man-made Bolts of Lightning|publisher=Abc.net.au |date= 27 January 2003|work=ABC Radio National|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of [[Operation Desert Storm]], [[F-15E]] crews observing the [[Iraq]]i military's massacre of Kurdish civilians at [[Chamchamal]] were forbidden from firing on the attackers, but instead used their lasers as a dazzler weapon. This ultimately proved ineffective in crashing any attack helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|title=Desert Shield and Desert Storm|year=2005|pages=30–31|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May 2006, the [[U.S. military]] announced it was using laser dazzlers mounted on M-4 rifles in [[Iraq War|troops in Iraq]] as a non-lethal way to stop drivers who fail to stop at checkpoints manned by American soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=APAB&amp;d_place=APAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=11200C0C5BA16025&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=NewsLibrary.com |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |date=2006-05-18 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countermeasures ==

One defense against laser dazzlers are narrowband [[optical filter]]s tuned to the frequency of the laser. To counter such defense, dazzlers can employ emitters using more than one [[wavelength]], or [[tunable laser]]s with wider range of output. Another defense is [[photochromic]] materials able to become opaque under high light energy densities. [[Nonlinear optics]] techniques are being investigated: e.g. vanadium-doped [[zinc telluride]] (ZnTe:V) can be used to form electro-optic power limiters able to selectively block the intense dazzler beam without affecting weaker light from an observed scene.

== Legislation ==

Weapons designed to cause permanent blindness are banned by the 1995 [[United Nations]] [[Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons]]. The dazzler is a [[non-lethal force|non-lethal]] [[weapon]] intended to cause [[Flash blindness|temporary blindness]] or disorientation and therefore falls outside this protocol.

== Manufacturers and models ==
{{Advert section|date=December 2015}}

* LE Systems, under the sponsorship of [[DARPA]], developed a dazzler based on a [[Diode-pumped solid-state laser|DPSS laser]], with green light output at 532&amp;nbsp;nm, essentially a higher-intensity version of a green [[laser pointer]]. The advantage of 532&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength lies in its ability to interact with human eyes in daylight and reduced light conditions.
* The ''[http://bemeyers.com/product/glare-mout/ Glare Mout]'' and ''[http://bemeyers.com/product/maritime-security-glare-la-9p/ Glare LA-9/P]'', developed by B.E. Meyers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bemeyers.com |title=B.E. Meyers &amp; Co., Inc |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide a non-lethal deterrent weapon which temporarily interferes with a subject's vision while causing no eye damage. Unlike simple laser pointers that are engineered to emit a tight beam, these lasers are designed to emit a slightly diverging green beam that is less of an eye hazard but retain the desired effect on the viewer. The diverging output also results in a larger spot at the intended target, making aiming the device at long distances, or at multiple subjects, much easier. The Glare Mout's effective range is 150m–2&amp;nbsp;km. The LA-9/P effective range is 300m–4&amp;nbsp;km, and it has a further safety feature that neutralizes the possibility of eye injury even at close ranges.
* The ''[[Dazer Laser]] GUARDIAN'', ''Dazer Laser STEALTH'' and "Dazer Laser DEFENDER" by Laser Energetics, Inc. are different types of optical distraction (ocular interruptor) laser systems which can temporarily visually impair, suppress, illuminate, target designate, warn and/or communicate visually with the intended target(s).  The GUARDIAN incorporates a 250&amp;nbsp;mW, 532&amp;nbsp;nm (visible-green) laser which utilizes patent-pending Variable Range &amp; Focus Optics for safe and effective engagement range from 1–1000 meters and Hailing &amp; Warning out to 2000 meters.  The GUARDIAN is fully compliant with FDA 21 CFR 1040 Regulations.  The DEFENDER incorporates a 450&amp;nbsp;mW, 532&amp;nbsp;nm (visible-green) laser which utilizes patent-pending Variable Range &amp; Focus Optics for safe and effective engagement range from 1–2400 meters and Hailing &amp; Warning out to 4000 meters.  The STEALTH is a multi-spectral, multi-functioning, weapons mounted laser system that provides the Operator with a Visible Laser Optical Distractor (300&amp;nbsp;mW), Visible (red or green) Pointer (Hi and Lo powers), IR Illuminator (Hi and Lo powers), IR Pointer (Hi and Lo powers) and White LED Flashlight (150 Lumens).  The STEALTH takes the functionality of a GUARDIAN's Optical Distractor, and combines it with an AN/PEQ-15 and also a Tactical LED Flashlight, and combines everything into one compact system to lighten the load of the Operator and have one firing trigger and set of batteries versus three.  Unlike all other optical distractors, or "dazzler", systems, which use fixed focus divergence angles, all Dazer Lasers utilize the patent-pending Variable Range &amp; Focus Optics to allow for engagements at ALL ranges, versus being limited to ranges from 10 meters (safety reasons) out to 500 meters (ineffective because beam is too large).  Incorporating an auto-shut off does not work in the battlefield as this simply turns the system off; but if the capability is needed at shorter ranges, an automatically shut off system now cannot work and endangers the Operator.  All Dazer Laser systems can operate from −20 C to +55 C, are waterproof to 10+ meters for 60+ minutes (model dependent), and ruggedized in accordance with MIL STD-810G requirements.
* The ''Saber 203'' dazzler or ''Saber 203 Grenade Shell Laser Intruder Countermeasure System'', uses a 250&amp;nbsp;mW red [[laser diode]], mounted in a hard plastic capsule in the shape of a standard [[40 mm grenade]], suitable for being loaded into a [[M203]] [[grenade launcher]]. It has an effective range of 300 meters. It is controlled via a box snapped under the launcher, with the batteries and firing switch housed in this box. In emergency it can be quickly ejected and replaced with a grenade. It is similar to the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|LANL]]-developed optical munition, Project Perseus. The [[U.S. Marine Corps]] brought Saber 203 dazzlers to [[Somalia]] in January 1995 during [[Operation United Shield]], but senior U.S. Department of Defense officials reportedly halted its experimental use in Somalia at the last minute for "humane reasons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/15/world/now-to-the-shores-of-somalia-with-beanbag-guns-and-goo.html |title=Now, to the Shores of Somalia with Beanbag Guns and Goo |date=February 15, 1995 |work=New York Times |first=Eric |last=Schmitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RightsBlinding"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1995/Us2.htm |title=U.S. Blinding Laser Weapons |date=May 1995 |work=Human Rights Watch Report}}, Vol. 7, No. 5&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Air Force, the Saber 203 system is also usable for law enforcement purposes.
* The ''JD-3'' laser dazzler is mounted on the Chinese [[Type 99 tank#Type 98|Type 98]] [[main battle tank]]. It is coupled with a [[laser warning receiver|laser radiation detector]], and automatically aims for the enemy's illuminating [[laser designator]], attempting to overwhelm its optical systems or blind the operator.
* The ''ZM-87'' Portable Laser Disturber is a Chinese electro-optic countermeasure laser device. It can blind enemy troops at up to 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;km range and temporarily blind them at up to 10&amp;nbsp;km range. Note that this weapon is banned by the 1995 [[United Nations]] [[Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons]]. See [[ZM-87]] for more information.
* The ''Photonic Disruptor'', classified as a ''[[threat assessment]] laser'' (TALI), was developed and manufactured by Wicked Lasers in cooperation with Xtreme Alternative Defense Systems. This tactical laser is equipped with a versatile focus-adjustable collimating lens to compensate for range and power intensity when used at close range to incapacitate an attacker, at a distance to safely identify threats. The Photonic Disruptor has been featured on Discovery Channel's "Future Weapons." It was also reportedly used by [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] during their operations with the ''[[Ady Gil]]'' in the [[Southern Ocean]] against Japanese whaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/01/whaling-protesters-pioneer-non-lethal-warfare/ |title=Whaling Protesters Pioneer Non-Lethal Warfare |work=Wired, Danger Room | first=David |last=Hambling |date=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Outfit DEC'' or ''Laser Dazzle Sight'' (LDS) is a British ship-based laser, used since the 1980s  The [[veiling-glare laser]] works on [[ultraviolet]] and is designed to dazzle by causing [[fluorescence]] in the lens of the [[human eye]]. There are other such laser weapon systems in development.&lt;ref name="RightsBlinding" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.testdept.org.uk/PPP-9.html |title=Company Search: Irwin Desman |work=Parasitic Protocol Portfolio |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220142627/http://www.testdept.org.uk/PPP-9.html |archivedate=2007-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aeronautics.ru/nws001/abl/abl011.htm |title=dead link |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010724043911/http://www.aeronautics.ru/nws001/abl/abl011.htm |archivedate=2001-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forecastinternational.com/archive/eo/eo12338.htm |title=dead link |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024627/http://www.forecastinternational.com/archive/eo/eo12338.htm |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PHASR Rifle.jpg|thumb|right|''PHaSR'', a United States dazzler style weapon.]]

* ''StunRay'' is a [[less-lethal]] optical incapacitation effector developed by Genesis Illumination Inc. It uses [[collimated]] incoherent (non-laser) broad spectrum [[visible light|visible]] and [[near infrared]] light from a short-arc lamp to safely and temporarily impair vision, disorient and incapacitate aggressors for 5 seconds to 3 minutes without causing physical harm. Full recover generally occurs in 10–20 minutes. The hand-held model is designed for a range of 10m to 100m. StunRay can be scaled up for ranges from 100m to 1000m for vehicle mounting, checkpoints, secure facilities, patrol boats, and ship protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genesis-illumination.com/StunRay/about/ |title=StunRay Non-Lethal Technology |publisher=Genesis-illumination.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''PHaSR'' or [[Personnel halting and stimulation response rifle]] was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense.
* Three US Patents are held by Science &amp; Engineering Associates (SEA) who is now QinetiQ North America. They are: 5,685,636 Eye Safe Laser Security Device; 6,007,218 Self-Contained Laser Illuminator Module; and 6,190,022 B1 Enhanced Non-Lethal Security Device.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4739">'''Electromagnetic absorbers''' are specifically chosen or designed materials that can inhibit the [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] or [[transmission (wave propagation)|transmission]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. For example, this can be accomplished with materials such as dielectrics combined with metal plates spaced at prescribed intervals or wavelengths. The particular absorption frequencies, thickness, component arrangement and configuration of the materials also determine capabilities and uses. In addition, researchers are studying [[materials science|advanced materials]] such as [[metamaterials]] in hopes of improved performance and diversity of applications. Some intended applications for the new absorbers include emitters, [[sensors]], [[spatial light modulators]], infrared camouflage,  [[wireless communication]], and use in [[thermophotovoltaics]].&lt;ref name=Alici&gt;

Generally, there are two types of absorbers: resonant absorbers and broadband absorbers. The resonant absorbers are frequency-dependent because of the desired resonance of the material at a particular wavelength. Different types of resonant absorbers are the ''[[Salisbury screen]]'', the ''[[Jaumann absorber]]'', the ''Dallenbach layer'', ''crossed grating absorbers'', and ''circuit analog (CA) absorbers''.

Broadband absorbers are independent of a particular frequency and can therefore be effective across a broad spectrum.&lt;ref name=knott&gt;

The '''Energy Resources Conservation Board''' (ERCB) was an independent, quasi-judicial agency of the [[Government of Alberta]]. It regulated the safe, responsible, and efficient development of Alberta's [[energy resource]]s: oil, [[natural gas]], [[Tar sands|oil sands]], coal, and pipelines. Led by eight Board members, the ERCB's team of [[engineers]], [[geologists]], [[technicians]], [[economists]], and other professionals served [[Alberta]]ns from thirteen locations across the province.

The ERCB's mission was to ensure that the discovery, development, and delivery of Alberta's energy resources took place in a manner that was fair, responsible and in the public interest.

The [http://www.ercb.ca ERCB] adjudicated and regulated matters related to [[energy]] within [[Alberta]] to ensure that the development, transportation, and monitoring of the province's energy resources were in the [[public interest]]. The Board provided this assurance of the public interest through its activities in the application and hearing process, [[regulation]], monitoring, and [[surveillance]] and enforcement.

The information and knowledge responsibility of the Board included the collection, storage, analysis, appraisal, dissemination and stakeholder awareness of information. [[Open access (publishing)|Open access]] to information developed awareness, understanding and responsible behavior and allowed the Board and stakeholders to make informed decisions about energy and utility matters. This responsibility would result in the Board discharging its advisory role with respect to matters under the jurisdiction of the Board.

The [[Government of Alberta]] owns about 80% of the province's [[mineral rights]], such as [[oil]], [[natural gas]], [[coal]], and the [[oil sands]]. In other words, most resources are owned by the people of Alberta through their government. While private companies can develop these resources, the ERCB was authorized by the government to protect the public's interest relating to the discovery, development, and delivery of these resources. Regulation was needed so that [[non-renewable resources]] were produced in a safe, responsible, and efficient manner, without waste.

The ERCB also ensured that everyone affected by development had a chance to be heard. When conflicts regarding development remained unresolved between companies and [[landowners]], the ERCB worked to settle the issues in a fair and balanced manner.

In 1996, the [[Alberta Geological Survey]] (AGS) joined the ERCB. AGS assisted the ERCB by providing data, information, knowledge and advice about the [[geology]] of Alberta.

==History==
Alberta's first energy regulatory body was created in 1938. A succession of agencies led to the new ERCB being established 1 January 2008, as a result of the realignment of the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (EUB) into the ERCB and the Alberta Utilities Commission. The ERCB also includes the Alberta Geological Survey.

In October 2008, ERCB was named one of [[Alberta's Top Employers]] by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which was announced by the [[Calgary Herald]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/story.html?id=02b19397-2fdf-4039-ba29-b93eaf908adb |title=Calgary Herald, "Alberta’s top 40 places to work", October 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015185038/http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/story.html?id=02b19397-2fdf-4039-ba29-b93eaf908adb |archivedate=2015-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Edmonton Journal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/story.html?id=5bc8514a-b0eb-4538-bab4-a63f11f51a16 |title=Edmonton Journal, "Alberta's best focus on attracting, keeping staff", October 31, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205184601/http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/story.html?id=5bc8514a-b0eb-4538-bab4-a63f11f51a16 |archivedate=2009-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluta.ca/top-employer-energy-resources-conservation-board|title=Reasons for Selection, 2009 Alberta's Top Employers competition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alberta Energy Regulator===
Alberta Energy Regulator is a corporation created by the Responsible Energy Development Act passed on 10 December 2012 and proclaimed on 17 June 2013,&lt;ref name=AERbrochure2013 /&gt; in the Alberta Legislature, operating at arm’s length from the Government of Alberta, under an appointed board of directors headed by Chair, Gerry Protti and CEO Jim Ellis,&lt;ref name=Pratt18June2013AER /&gt; appointed by Energy Minister [[Ken Hughes]]. On 17 June 2013, all regulatory functions previously carried out by the Energy Resources Conservation Board were taken over by the [[Alberta Energy Regulator]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/news-releases/news-release-2013-06-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GlobeMail&gt;{{cite news|title=Alberta regulator falls short on disclosure|location=Calgary, Alberta|date=17 June 2013|author=Jeffrey Jones |publisher=The Globe and Mail|series=ROB Insight Energy}}pay wall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;"Alberta’s energy regulator has a new name, new responsibilities and new leadership. After sitting on the news of a recent spill for 12 days, it apparently also needs new policies about transparency. The Alberta Energy Regulator, formerly the Energy Resources Conservation Board, has a tough act to follow when it comes to alerting the public about pipeline ruptures and other incidents that cause hydrocarbons to soak the landscape. Its federal counterpart, the [[National Energy Board]], sent the message last week that the bar has been raised (Globe and Mail 17 June 2013)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberta Energy Regulator is "100 per cent funded by industry and is authorized to collect funds through an administrative fee levied on oil and gas wells, oil sands mines, and coal mines. The industry-funded model is commonly used by regulatory agencies from various sectors across North America."&lt;ref name=AERbrochure2013 /&gt; AER has "an annual budget of more than $165 million, more than "1000 staff working in 13 locations across Alberta." Alberta Energy Regulator "regulates approximately - 181,000 active wells, 27,800 oil facilities and 20,000 gas facilities, and 405,000 kilometres (km) of pipelines." AER also "considers some 36 800 applications for energy development every year."&lt;ref name=AERbrochure2013 /&gt;

In December 2012, the [http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/r17p3.pdf Responsible Energy Development Act]&lt;ref name=RespEnergydec2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/documents/Acts/r17p3.pdf|format=PDF|title=Responsible Energy Development Act|date=10 December 2012|publisher=Government of Alberta|location=Edmonton, Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed in the Alberta Legislature. Alberta Energy Regulator is mandated under the Act, to direct and oversee "the orderly transition from the [[Energy Resources Conservation Act]] to the [[Responsible Energy Development Act]].&lt;ref name=RespEnergydec2012 /&gt; Under this act, the newly formed Alberta Energy Regulator, will  "bring together the regulatory functions from the Energy Resources Conservation Board and the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Resource Development into a one-stop shop."&lt;ref name=GovABjune2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulatory Enhancement Project|publisher=Alberta Energy|url=http://www.energy.alberta.ca/Initiatives/RegulatoryEnhancement.asp |date=12 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925201503/http://www.energy.alberta.ca/Initiatives/RegulatoryEnhancement.asp |archivedate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alberta Energy Regulator is now "responsible for all projects from application to reclamation."

In the past the Energy Resources Conservation Board and Alberta Environment conducted investigations differently. Alberta Surface Rights Group, the United Landowners of Alberta, First Nations, farmers and ranchers have expressed concerns about the streamlining of regulatory processes that may benefit oil and gas industries at their expense.&lt;ref name=Pratt18June2013AER /&gt;

According to their brochure the Alberta Energy Regulator "ensures the safe, efficient, orderly, and environmentally responsible development of hydrocarbon resources over their entire life cycle. This includes allocating and conserving water resources, managing public lands, and protecting the environment while providing economic benefits for all Albertans."&lt;ref name=AERbrochure2013&gt;{{cite web|title=The Alberta Energy Regulator|url=http://www.aer.ca/documents/about-us/AER_Brochure.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER)|year=2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421082116/http://www.aer.ca/documents/about-us/AER_Brochure.pdf|archivedate=2014-04-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marketwire22June2013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/alberta-energy-regulator-operations-continue-during-southern-alberta-floods-1804731.htm|date=22 June 2013|title=Alberta Energy Regulator Operations Continue During Southern Alberta Floods|location=Calgary, Alberta|publisher=Marketwired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
The ERCB regulated the safe, responsible, and efficient development of oil, natural gas, oil sands, and coal, and as well as the pipelines to move the resources to market.

Regulation was done through two core functions: adjudication and regulation, and information and knowledge. ERCB approval must have been given at almost every step of an energy project’s life.

==Governance==
To maintain its autonomous structure, the ERCB answered directly to the Executive Council (Cabinet) of Alberta through the Minister of Energy, but it made its formal decisions independently in accordance with the six statutes it administers.

==Organization structure==
The ERCB was led by a Board of eight people: a Chairman and Board Members. Supporting the Chairman and Board Members was the Executive Committee, and approximately 900 staff who worked in eight main branches:

===Applications===
This branch, made up of three groups, provided a streamlined approach to processing some 40 000 energy development applications each year. The Facilities Group handled project reviews, audits, and approvals related to new or modified oil and gas facilities, such as wells, pipelines, batteries, and gas plants. The Resource Group dealt with applications and issues related to development and conservation projects for oil, gas, and coal. The Business Operations and Development Group managed the coordination of administrative support, approvals development, planning, objections, and hearings.

===Field Surveillance and Operations===
This branch provided technical and operational expertise in the development, application, and enforcement of regulatory requirements for conventional and nonconventional resources. The branch ensured that oil and gas operations are conducted in a safe and responsible manner through incident response, resource conservation, protection of the environment, and industry liability management. Operating from Field Centres across Alberta, field staff inspected construction, operation, and abandonment operations at oil, gas, and oil sands facilities and respond to emergencies and public concerns on a 24-hour basis.

===Corporate Support===
This branch incorporated several groups. Human Resources provides services and programs to ensure that a competent and committed workforce was in place to achieve ERCB goals and objectives. The Communications Group developed strategic communication, consultation strategies and delivers related media, Web site, and document services to keep staff and stakeholders informed about ERCB activities. Administrative Services provided building, library, and printing services.

===Finance===
This branch provided revenue and expenditure management and administration of the industry funding levy. In addition, staff coordinated the preparation of the ERCB’s three-year business plan and performance reporting.

===Information and Systems Services===
This branch was responsible for ERCB information systems, support, and technological infrastructure, with a focus on new ways to deliver electronic commerce. Another core area was the collection and dissemination of energy resource information, including oil and gas production. This information was also used to determine provincial royalties, well records, regulatory publications, maps, and various energy databases.

===Law===
This branch provided a wide range of legal advice and services to the organization, with a focus on procedural fairness and objectivity. Its responsibilities included application and regulatory policy, hearings, proceedings, related internal and external consultations, and the formulation of energy regulations and legislation. The branch administered intervener funding and led a key advisory committee that advises the Board on decisions and policy matters.

===Geology, Environmental Science, and Economics===
This branch maintained an integrated and current inventory of Alberta’s subsurface energy, mineral, and other resources in a geological framework. It provided knowledge, advice, and forecasts about the states of earth-energy resource development in the context of Alberta’s environment, economy, and society. The branch also developed and supported regulatory processes and best practices to conserve earth-energy resources, maintains environmental quality, assures public safety, and guides informed risk taking in regulatory and policy decisions.

===Oil Sands===
The Oil Sands Branch had overall responsibility for how the ERCB regulateed oil sands activities in Alberta. The branch comprised the Mineable Oil Sands Group, which looked after oil sands developments that use mining recovery technology as well as bitumen upgrading, and the In Situ Oil Sands Group, which focused on developments using recovery technology involving subsurface or in situ recovery methods. Collaborating with other ERCB branches, the Oil Sands Branch took the lead on processing applications, conducting surveillance and enforcement of approved projects, and carrying out geological assessments as they apply to the oil sands.

In their 2012 report ECRB cautioned that oil sands operators failed to convert their [[oil sands tailings ponds|tailings ponds]] into deposits suitable for reclamation in a timely fashion, as proposed in their project applications. "The volume of fluid tailings, and the area required to hold fluid tailings, continued to grow, and the reclamation of tailings ponds was further delayed."&lt;ref name=tailings20112012&gt;{{cite report|title=2012 Tailings Management Assessment Report: Oil Sands Mining Industry|date=June 2013|url=http://www.ercb.ca/oilsands/tailings-plans/TailingsManagementAssessmentReport2011-2012.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB)|location=Calgary, Alberta|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ECRB follows the industry wide directive, Directive 074, the first of its kind, which sets out the "industry-wide requirements for tailings management," requiring "operators to commit resources to research, develop, and implement fluid tailings reduction technologies and to commit to tailings management and progressive reclamation as operational priorities that are integrated with mine planning and bitumen production activities."&lt;ref name=tailings20112012 /&gt; The Government of Alberta is setting up a Tailings Management Framework to complement and expand Directive 074's policies to "ensure that fluid fine tailings are reclaimed as quickly as possible and that current inventories are reduced."&lt;ref name=tailings20112012 /&gt;

On 12 June 2013 the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo after many days of heavy rain, declared a state of emergency. The flood conditions lasted from June 10–18, 2013.

==Energy Applications==
An application was a request by a company for ERCB approval—in the form of a licence, order, permit, or approval—for an energy project. Most energy-related projects require ERCB approval. Each year tens of thousands of applications were reviewed and approved by the ERCB.

The ERCB also played a vital environmental protection role by reviewing flaring permits, oilfield waste disposal facilities, drilling waste practices, and emergency response plans.

ERCB approval for a facility or project was considered to be routine if an application was complete, there were no landowner objections, and the company applying had met all technical, safety, public consultation, and environmental requirements. The turnaround time for a complete and well-prepared routine application could be as short as one day.

Some projects required input from other government departments. The ERCB passed such applications to Alberta Environment, which handles distribution to other departments. This "one-window" approach meant that applicants did not have to go to each government department for individual review and approval. The general rule was that each government department checks that a specific proposal meets its own regulations and standards and then forwards any deficiencies or concerns to the ERCB via Alberta Environment.

Nonroutine applications took more time—weeks, or even months—to process if there were landowner objections, community and environmental concerns, or objections from competing companies. Objections to applications may also have been resolved through facilitation, mediation, or negotiated settlements approved by the Board. However, any unresolved matter or objection related to an application may have proceeded to an ERCB hearing.

==ERCB Hearings==
An ERCB hearing was a formal process that provided an important opportunity for different points of view about an energy project to be aired in a fair and orderly forum. A hearing allowed for an open, public testing of technical, environmental, social, and economic evidence from those involved. The process ensured that all relevant arguments for and against the energy facility project are heard.

ERCB hearings were held when the ERCB received an objection from a person who may have been directly and adversely affected by a proposed project. Applications filed may have created community concern or a need for more information; however, these matters were often settled through an Appropriate Dispute Resolution (ADR) process. When matters were settled through ADR or there were no public concerns and objections, there was no need for a hearing. The Board would also dismiss objections if the person does not appear to be directly or adversely affected.

The ERCB maild a Notice of Hearing to inform people and organizations affected by an application about the hearing. The Notice of Hearing may have been published in daily and/or weekly newspapers.

Hearing notices were available on the ERCB Web site. Companies involved in large projects usually held an open house to explain their proposed project, answer citizens’ questions, and address the community’s concerns.

The Notice of Hearing provided interested parties with the following information:
* date, time, and location of the hearing,
* application number and nature of the application,
* a contact for the company that filed the application,
* ERCB information,
* the due date for filing objections or interventions, and
* a statement that all material relating to the proceeding is subject to Alberta’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy legislation.

An ERCB hearing followed a formal process to ensure that everyone had a say:
* ''Opening Remarks'': The panel chair explains the purpose of the hearing and introduces the members of the panel and all ERCB staff in the room. Then participants in the hearing register an appearance, coming forward and introducing themselves.
* ''Preliminary Matters'': Procedural and legal matters are presented, such as adjournment requests or the scheduling of a specific witness at a particular time.
* ''Applicant (Application)'': The applicant presents its case and may question its own witnesses. Then interveners, ERCB staff, and the Board panel may cross-examine those witnesses. Once cross-examinations are complete, the applicant may question the witnesses again to clarify any issues that arose.
* ''Interveners'': Interveners next present their cases in the same order they registered. After the intervener gives direct evidence, the lawyer for the applicant may cross-examine, followed by the other interveners who wish to cross-examine. ERCB staff and panel members may then cross-examine the intervener. Following cross-examination, the intervener is entitled to clarify any matters that arose.
* ''Rebuttal Evidence by Applicant'': Once the above process is complete with all the interveners and their witnesses, the applicant may submit additional evidence to address new points raised by interveners' evidence.
* ''Final Argument or Summation'': Each participant may provide an explanation of what he or she believes are the important aspects of the issues involved and what decisions they feel the panel should make. The applicant may respond to interveners' arguments.
* ''Closing of Hearing'': The panel chair announces the hearing is completed and that the decision of the panel and the reasons for it will be given at a later date.

'''Field-emission electric propulsion''' ('''FEEP''') is an advanced electrostatic space propulsion concept, a form of [[ion thruster]], that uses liquid [[metal]] (usually either [[caesium]], [[indium]] or [[mercury (element)|mercury]]) as a propellant. A FEEP device consists of an emitter and an accelerator electrode. A potential difference of the order of 10 kV is applied between the two, which generates a strong [[electric field]] at the tip of the metal surface. The interplay of electric force and surface tension generates surface instabilities which give rise to [[Taylor cone]]s on the liquid surface. At sufficiently high values of the applied field, ions are extracted from the cone tip by field evaporation or similar mechanisms, which then are accelerated to high velocities (typically 100&amp;nbsp;km/s or more).

A separate electron source is required to keep the spacecraft electrically neutral. Due to its very low thrust (in the [[newton (unit)|micronewton]] to millinewton range), FEEP thrusters are primarily used for microradian, micronewton [[attitude control]] on [[spacecraft]], such as in the ESA/NASA [[LISA Pathfinder]] scientific spacecraft. 

The '''FEEP''' thruster was also slated for installation on [[Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer]] spacecraft,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci2.esa.int/hyper/docs/HYP-5-02_v30final.pdf FEEP feasibility report]&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[Gridded ion thruster]] was used instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci2.esa.int/hyper/docs/HYP-5-02_v30final.pdf GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) from eoportal.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept==

Field emission electric propulsion (FEEP) is an electrostatic propulsion concept based on field ionization of a liquid metal and subsequent acceleration of the ions by a strong electric field. FEEP is currently the object of interest in the scientific community, due to its unique features: sub-μN to mN thrust range, near instantaneous switch on/switch off capability, and high-resolution throttleability (better than one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), which enables accurate thrust modulation in both continuous and pulsed modes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alta-space.com/uploads/file/publications/feep/Marcuccio-JPP14_5_1998.pdf Marcuccio, S., Genovese, A., Andrenucci, M., "Experimental Performance of Field Emission Microthrusters", Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 14, No. 5, September-October 1998, pp. 774-781.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520151812/http://www.alta-space.com/uploads/file/publications/feep/Marcuccio-JPP14_5_1998.pdf |date=2013-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently baseline for scientific missions onboard [[drag-free satellite]]s, this propulsion system has also been proposed for attitude control and orbit maintenance on
commercial small satellites and constellations.

This type of thruster can accelerate a large number of different liquid metals or alloys. The best performance (in terms of thrust efficiency and power-to-thrust ratio) can be obtained using high atomic weight alkali metals, such as cesium and rubidium (133 amu for Cs, 85.5 amu for Rb). These propellants have a low ionization potential (3.87 eV for Cs and 4.16 eV for Rb), low melting point (28.7 °C for Cs and 38.9 °C for Rb) and very good wetting capabilities. These features lead to low power losses due to ionization and heating and the capability to use capillary forces for feeding purposes (i.e. no pressurised tanks nor valves are required). Moreover, alkali metals have the lowest attitude to form ionized droplets or multiply-charged ions, thus leading to the best attainable mass efficiency. The actual thrust is produced by exhausting a beam of mainly singly-ionized cesium or rubidium atoms, produced by field evaporation at the tip of the emitter.

An accelerating electrode (accelerator) is placed directly in front of the emitter. This electrode consists of a metal (usually stainless steel) plate where two sharp blades are machined. When thrust is required, a strong electric field is generated by the application of a high voltage difference between the emitter and the accelerator. Under this condition, the free surface of the liquid metal enters a regime of local instability, due to the combined effects of the electrostatic force and the surface tension. A series of protruding cusps, or "Taylor cones" are thus created. When the electric field reaches a value in the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; V/m, the atoms at the tip of the cusps spontaneously ionize and an ion jet is extracted by the electric field, while the electrons are rejected in the bulk of the liquid. An external source of electrons (neutralizer) provides negative charges to maintain global electrical neutrality of the thruster assembly.

==The slit emitter==

Liquid metal ion sources (LMIS) based on field ionization or field evaporation were introduced in the late '60s and quickly became widespread as simple, cheap ion sources for a number of applications. In particular, the use of LMIS operated on gallium, indium, alkali metals or alloys has been standard practice in [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS) since the '70s.

While there exist different field emitter configurations, such as the needle, the capillary and slit emitter types, the principle of operation is the same in all cases. In the slit emitter, for example, a liquid metal propellant is fed by capillary forces through a narrow channel. The emitter consists of two identical halves made from stainless steel, and clamped or screwed together. A nickel layer, sputter deposited onto one of the emitter halves, outlines the desired channel contour and determines channel height (a.k.a. slit height, typically 1–2 μm) and channel width (a.k.a. slit length, ranging from 1&amp;nbsp;mm up to about 7&amp;nbsp;cm).

The channel ends at the emitter tip, formed by sharp edges that are located opposite a negative, or accelerator, electrode, and separated by a small gap (about 0.6&amp;nbsp;mm) from the emitter tip. An extraction voltage is applied between the two electrodes. The emitter carries a positive potential while the accelerator is at negative potential. The electric field being generated between the emitter and accelerator now acts on the liquid metal propellant.

The narrow slit width not only enables the capillary feed, but, when combined with the sharp channel edges directly opposite the accelerator, also ensures that a high electric field strength is obtained near the slit exit. The liquid metal column, when subjected to this electric field, begins to deform, forming cusps (Taylor cones), which protrude from the surface of the liquid. As the liquid cusps form ever sharper cones due to the action of the electric field, the local electric field strength near these cusps intensifies. Once a local electric field strength of about 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; V/m is reached, electrons are ripped off the metal atoms. These electrons are collected through the liquid metal column by the channel walls, and the positive ions are accelerated away from the liquid through a gap in the negative accelerator electrode by the same electric field that created them.

Slit emitters had been developed to increase the emitting area of the thruster in order to yield higher thrust levels and to avoid the irregular behaviour observed for single emitters. The substantial advantage of slit emitters over stacked needles is in the self-adjusting mechanism governing the formation and redistribution of emission sites on the liquid metal surface according to the operating parameters; in a stacked-needle array, on the contrary, the Taylor cones can only exist on the fixed tips, which pre-configure a geometrical arrangement that can only be consistent with one particular operating condition. 

Slit emitters with a wide variety of slit widths have been fabricated; currently, devices with slit widths between 2&amp;nbsp;mm and 7&amp;nbsp;cm are available. These devices, spanning a thrust range from 0.1 μN to 2&amp;nbsp;mN, are operated with cesium or rubidium.

==Other designs==
The miniaturized '''FEEP''' module design with a crown-shape emitter to fit into the standard [[CubeSat]] chassis was reported in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/pdf/2017/04/e3sconf_espc2017_15003.pdf DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW COST PPU FOR FEEP ELECTRIC PROPULSION USING COTS COMPONENTS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The single-emitter '''FEEP''' design of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mN is commercially available,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cubesatshop.com/product/ifm-nano-thruster/ IFM Nano Thruster for CubeSats €30,000]&lt;/ref&gt;, and its arrayed version development is nearing completion as in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://artes.esa.int/projects/ifm-350-nano-thruster-iod IFM 350 NANO THRUSTER - IOD]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16102">A&amp;nbsp;'''genetically modified virus'''&amp;nbsp;is a&amp;nbsp;[[virus]]&amp;nbsp;that has gone through [[genetic modification]] for various&amp;nbsp;[[biomedical]]&amp;nbsp;purposes, agricultural purposes, [[Biological pest control|bio-control]] and technological purposes. Genetic modification involves the insertion or deletion of genes to improve organisms and is usually obtained with [[biotechnology]].

==General usage==
Genetic modification involves the insertion or deletion of genes into the viral genome to improve organisms and is usually obtained with biotechnology methods. These methods of gene transfer include physically inserting the extra DNA into the nucleus of the intended host with a very small syringe, or with very small particles fired from a [[gene gun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Cancer treatment ===
In 2004, researchers reported that a genetically modified virus that exploits the selfish behaviour of cancer cells might offer an alternative way of killing tumours.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn5056-geneticallymodified-virus-explodes-cancer-cells.html Genetically-modified virus explodes cancer cells]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12839-gm-virus-shrinks-cancer-tumours-in-humans.html GM virus shrinks cancer tumours in humans]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, several researchers have developed genetically modified [[oncolytic virus]]es that show promise as treatments for various types of [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Leja|first1=J.|last2=Yu|first2=D.|last3=Nilsson|first3=B.|last4=Gedda|first4=L.|last5=Zieba|first5=A.|last6=Hakkarainen|first6=T.|last7=Åkerström|first7=G.|last8=Öberg|first8=K.|last9=Giandomenico|first9=V.|year=2011|title=Oncolytic adenovirus modified with somatostatin motifs for selective infection of neuroendocrine tumor cells|journal=Gene Therapy|volume=18|issue=11|pages=1052–1062|doi=10.1038/gt.2011.54|pmc=|pmid=21490682|last10=Essand|first10=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vaccines&amp;nbsp;===
In 2001, it was reported that genetically modified viruses can possibly be used to develop vaccines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephenson|first=J. R.|date=March 2001|title=Genetically modified viruses: vaccines by design|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology|volume=2|issue=1|pages=47–76|issn=1389-2010|pmid=11482348}}&lt;/ref&gt; against diseases such as, AIDS, herpes, dengue fever and viral hepatitis by using a proven safe vaccine virus, such as [[adenovirus]], and modify its genome to have genes that code for [[Immunogenicity|immunogenic]] proteins that can spike the immune systems response to then be able to fight the virus.

=== Heart pacemaker ===
In 2012, US researchers reported that they injected a genetically modified virus into the heart of pigs.  This virus inserted into the heart muscles a gene called [[T-box|Tbx18]] which enabled heartbeats.  The researchers forecast that one day this technique could be used to restore the heartbeat in humans who would otherwise need [[electronic pacemaker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, James (16 December 2012) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20713986 Virus rebuilds heart's own pacemaker in animal tests] BBC News Health, Retrieved 5 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kapoor|first1=N.|last2=Liang|first2=W.|last3=Marbán|first3=E.|last4=Cho|first4=H.

== Bio-control ==

=== Rabbits ===
In Spain and Portugal, by 2005 rabbits had declined by as much as 95% over 50 years due diseases such as [[myxomatosis]], [[rabbit haemorrhagic disease]] and other causes. This in turn caused declines in predators like the [[Iberian lynx]], a critically endangered species.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, Dan (2005)[https://www.ualberta.ca/~dhik/lsg/report_lynx_rabit.pdf Reversing Rabbit Decline One of the biggest challenges for nature conservation in Spain and Portugal] University of Alberta, Canada, Retrieved 30 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="decpaper"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iberianature.com/material/documents/LynxBrief12E.pdf|title=LynxBrief|last=Ward|first=Dan|date=December 2008|accessdate=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000 Spanish researchers investigated a genetically modified virus which might have protected rabbits in the wild against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bárcena|first1=J.|last2=Morales|first2=M.|last3=Vázquez|first3=B.|last4=Boga|first4=J.

===&amp;nbsp;Papayas ===
Tropical and subtropical regions located in the United States, South America, India, Africa, Mexico, China, and Australia suffered a decline in [[papaya]] production due to the [[papaya ringspot virus]] (PRSV). To combat this disease PRSV-resistant papaya was genetically engineered through [[gene technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Azad|first=Md. Abul Kalam|last2=Amin|first2=Latifah|last3=Sidik|first3=Nik Marzuki|date=2014|title=Gene Technology for Papaya Ringspot Virus Disease Management|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2014/768038/|journal=The Scientific World Journal|volume=2014|pages=1–11|doi=10.1155/2014/768038|issn=2356-6140}}&lt;/ref&gt; PSRV-resistant papayas were engineered by using a protein mediated, RNA-silencing mechanism. This was achieved through an [[agrobacterium]] mediated transformation of the papaya. Other methods used to combat the disease are, a [[gene gun]] method and post-transcriptional gene silencing technology. Post-transcriptional gene silencing technology is still currently being studied and can possibly be used for treatment of PRSV in the future.

A scientist claims she was infected by a genetically modified virus while working for Pfizer. In her federal lawsuit she says she has been intermittently paralyzed by the Pfizer-designed virus. "McClain, of Deep River, suspects she was inadvertently exposed, through work by a former Pfizer colleague in 2002 or 2003, to an engineered form of the [[lentivirus]], a virus similar to the one that can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-pfizer-virus-lawsuit-0314.artmar14,0,5614508,print.story|title=Ex-Pfizer Worker Cites Genetically Engineered Virus In Lawsuit Over Firing|date=March 14, 2010|publisher=Courant.com|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that McClain failed to demonstrate that her illness was caused by exposure to the lentivirus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6796485641266292013|title=McClain v.

'''Grimsby Dock Tower''' is a hydraulic [[accumulator tower]] and a maritime landmark at the entrance to the [[Royal Dock, Grimsby]], in [[North East Lincolnshire]], England. It was completed on 27 March 1852 with the purpose of containing a {{convert|30000|impgal|L|adj=on}} reservoir at a height of {{convert|200|ft|m}}, that was used to provide [[hydraulic power network|hydraulic power]] to power the machinery of the [[Grimsby Docks]].&lt;ref name="Shire, Hydraulic machines" &gt;{{cite book
  |title=Hydraulic Machines
  |last=Jarvis  |first=Adrian
  |publisher=Shire
  |isbn=0-85263-751-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme height of the tower was necessary to achieve sufficient pressure, and as a result of this, the tower can be seen for several miles around, even far inland on the north bank of the [[River Humber]] in villages such as [[Patrington]].

==History and design==
{{see also|Hydraulic accumulator}}
The tower was built to provide water pressure to power the hydraulic machinery (for cranes, lock gates and sluices) at the Grimsby Docks. The tower was built to carry a tank {{convert|200|ft|m}} above the ground with a direct feed into the machinery. Small pumps topped up the tank as the hydraulic machinery drew off water. The tower system was brought into use in 1852 working the machinery of the lock gates, dry-docks and fifteen quayside cranes, and also to supply fresh water to ships and the dwelling houses on the dock premises. The water was obtained from a well, {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|47|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep, with a boring of {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter to the chalk rock in the centre, situated near to where the ''[[Grimsby Evening Telegraph]]'' has its present offices. The well was also fed by seven borings of {{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter, at intervals in a length of {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}}, which discharged into the well by a brick culvert {{convert|3|ft|m|abbr=on}} in diameter.

Water was conveyed from the well to the tower in a cast iron pipe thirteen inches in diameter when it was then forced into the tank by two force pumps, each of ten inches in diameter, worked by a duplicate, horizontal engine of twenty-five horse power. All the engines, pumps and pipes and the whole of the machinery were made by Mr Mitchell of the [[Perran Foundry]], Cornwall.

During the building of the tower, Armstrong developed another system using [[hydraulic accumulator#Raised weight|weighted accumulator]]s, which at once was found to have great advantages. The working hydraulic pressure was greater, permitting more compact and cheaper machinery and everything was at ground level. The first such installation was at [[New Holland, North Lincolnshire|New Holland]] dock and pier, actually brought into use more than a year before the Grimsby system.

===Architectural design, construction and opening===
The tower was designed by [[James William Wild]] who based its appearance on that of the [[Torre del Mangia]] on the [[Palazzo Pubblico]] in [[Siena]]. It was built under the supervision of J. M. Rendel, who was the civil engineer in charge of construction of the Royal Dock.

The ground floor of the tower was lined with pink, white and blue drapery when [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] came with Prince Albert to visit the dock and 'open' the tower in October 1854. Her Majesty gave permission for Prince Albert, the Prince of Wales and the Princess Royal to accompany Mr Randel in the hydraulic lift to the gallery running around the tower above the water tank, from which a clear view of Grimsby, [[Cleethorpes]] and the mouth of the [[River Humber]] is obtained. 

The tower is {{convert|309|ft|m}} high, {{convert|28|ft|m}} wide at the base, and tapers gradually to {{convert|26|ft|m}} below the first projection; its walls are {{convert|4|ft|m}} thick and narrow to {{convert|3|ft|m}} at the [[string course]] under the [[corbel]]s. The bricks of this plain brick tower were made from clay obtained from excavations in the marsh adjoining the docks, and are set in blue lime mortar. Hoop iron bond is used in the walls to a considerable extent. The foundation of the tower is a solid masonry wall built upon a timber bearer piling. Approximately one million bricks were used in its construction. 

Local legend has it that the tower was built on a foundation of cotton wool; the story likely has its origins in the profitable import of cotton to [[West Yorkshire]] which an impetus to the building of the [[Royal Dock]] and the tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/resident/libraries-and-archives/archives--local-and-family-history/local-landmarks-dock-tower/| title = Local Landmarks - The Dock Tower| publisher = North East Lincolnshire Council| accessdate = 12 March 2015| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402115041/http://www.nelincs.gov.uk/resident/libraries-and-archives/archives--local-and-family-history/local-landmarks-dock-tower/| archivedate = 2 April 2015| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later use===
The Dock Tower continued to provide water for hydraulic working until 1892 when the erection of the [[hydraulic accumulator]] tower on the opposite pier approximately {{convert|200|ft|m}} to the North West of the Dock Tower took over - water in this structure was pressurised by a 300-tonne weight. Present dock and lock machinery are powered by electric or electro-hydraulic energy. 

During the [[Second World War]], there were plans to demolish the tower, as it acted as a beacon for German [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft heading towards [[Liverpool]]. Later, a [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] was placed on the bricks paying tribute to the [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] crews of the war.

The tower's lift is no longer in operation with access to the top via a spiral staircase in one corner of the building. The second balcony is currently used for the transmission and reception of radio signals.

The tower is [[Grade I listed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1379870|desc=The Dock Tower|accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the subject of a Preservation Order.

==Model==
There is a model of the Grimsby Dock Tower entirely constructed of [[Lego]], at [[Legoland Windsor|Legoland]] in Windsor. While the tower itself is correct, a large building has been incorrectly added to the base of the tower.

'''H-1NF''' is the Australian Plasma Fusion Research Facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://h1nf.anu.edu.au/facility/ Facility overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

==H-1 heliac stellarator==
The ''H-1'' flexible [[Heliac]] is a three field-period helical axis [[stellarator]] located in the [[ANU Research School of Physics and Engineering]] at Canberra, Australia. Optimisation of the H-1 power supplies for low current ripple allows precise control of the ratio of  secondary (helical, vertical) coil to primary (poloidal, toroidal) coil currents, resulting in a finely tunable magnetic geometry. Slight variation in the current ratio between shots (plasma discharges) in a sequence corresponds to a high resolution parameter scan through magnetic configurations (i.e.: rotational transform profile, magnetic well). The programmable control system allows for repetition rates of around 30 shots per hour, limited by data acquisition time and magnet cooling time.

==Stated objectives==
* Provide a high-temperature plasma national facility of international standing on a scale appropriate to Australia's research budget.
* Provide a focus for national and international collaborative research, make significant contributions to the global fusion research effort and increase the Australian presence in the field of plasma fusion power into the next century.
* Gain a detailed understanding of the basic physics of hot plasma which is magnetically confined in the helical-axis stellarator configuration.
* Develop advanced plasma measurement systems ("diagnostics"), integrating real-time processing and multi-dimensional visualization of data.

The station is expected to be the most powerful hydroelectric energy source in Kenya.&lt;ref name="2R"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nation.co.ke/news/Construction-of-Sh200bn-dam-on-course/1056-4794510-ns7t3l/index.html |date=7 October 2017 |title=Ruling paves way for building of Kenya's largest dam |access-date=10 October 2018 |first=Kitavi | last=Mutua | newspaper=[[Daily Nation]] |location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The power station would lie at [[Kibuka Falls]], across the Tana River, a in the vicinity of Mwingi National Reserve, at the border between [[Kitui County]] and [[Tharaka-Nithi County]], approximately {{convert|280|km|mi}} north-east of the city of [[Nairobi]], the country's capital and its largest city.&lt;ref name="3R"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=10 October 2018 |date=10 October 2018 |title=Distance between Posta, Nairobi, Kenya and Mwingi National Reserve, Kenya |publisher=Globefeed.com | url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Kenya_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Posta%2C%20Nairobi%2C%20Kenya&amp;toplace=Mwingi%20National%20Reserve%2C%20Kenya&amp;dt1=ChIJV1OHd3EaLxgRGgW9Tdox5jw&amp;dt2=ChIJAUUBhNg9JxgR07bUSxdlOuU&amp;sr=dc |author=Globefeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This location is downstream of the [[Hydroelectric_power_in_Kenya#Seven_Forks_Scheme|Seven Forks Scheme]].&lt;ref name="2R"/&gt;

==Overview==
This development is part of the [[Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor]] project (LAPSSET).&lt;ref name="2R"/&gt; The dam is expected to create a lake with a surface area of {{convert|165|km2|acre|}} and holding {{convert|5600000000|m3|ft3}} of water. An estimated 4,500 families in Kiuti and Tharaka Nithi counties, are expected to be displaced by the new dam. In addition to the planned 693 megawatts of electricity, the dam will provide water for the irrigation of more than {{convert|250000|ha|acre}} of farmland. The dam is also expected to mitigate flooding in the coastal counties during the rainy season.&lt;ref name="2R"/&gt;

==History==
the idea to build this dam was conceived in 2009, during the [[Mwai Kibaki]] presidency. Following a tendering process, a [[United Kingdom|British]] entity, ''GBM Engineering Consortium'', based in London, was the only qualifier for the tender. GBM beat six other international construction firms, five of the [[China|Chinese]].&lt;ref name="2R"/&gt; Once initiated, construction is expected to last six years.&lt;ref name="1R"/&gt;

==Ownership==
The [[consortium]] that is developing the dam and power station, will design, fund, build, own, operate and transfer the project, after recovering their investment, during 20 years of ownership, following commercial commissioning.&lt;ref name="2R"/&gt;

==Construction costs==
The estimated costs for the dam and power plant is estimated at US$2 billion (KSh200 billion).&lt;ref name="2R"/&gt;

==Timetable==
The dam and power station will be developed in phases. The first phase, with generation capacity of {{convert|495|MW}}, is expected to come online in 2031. The second phase, with capacity of another {{convert|198|MW}} is expected online in 1932.&lt;ref name="4R"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constructionkenya.com/933/high-grand-falls-dam-kenya/ |title=British firm to build Kenya’s largest water reservoir |access-date=10 October 2018 |date=4 October 2018

'''Information-led development (ILD)''' is a development strategy whereby a developing country makes as a primary economic policy focus the creation and development of a national [[information technology]] (IT) sector with the express aim of relying on this sector as an engine of growth. Notable examples of such countries are [[India]] and the [[Philippines]]. Increasingly, tools from information-led development are being used for community economic development in both developed countries and emerging markets.

==Information-led development as community economic development==

More recently, a new formulation of ILD has emerged. With origins in community economic development in the United States, the new ILD model describes the use of data to generate actionable information or information solutions to development challenges. Examples of this include the inclusion of non-financial payment obligations in consumer credit files, also known as [[alternative data]], and the use of this information in underwriting, as a means to reduce financial exclusion in the United States, where an estimated 54 million Americans are shut out of mainstream credit access as there is insufficient information about them in their credit files to be scored by a credit scoring model. This variant of ILD was pioneered by [[Political and Economic Research Council|PERC]], a non-profit policy research organization and development intermediary headquartered in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infopolicy.org/content/information-led-development-ild Information-Led Development], [[Political and Economic Research Council|PERC]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other US-based organizations, including [[Social Compact]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialcompact.org/index.php/site/research/category/intl_projects/ World Bank Drilldown Pilots]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Local Initiatives Support Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lisc-chicago.org/content/11/documents/metroedge-brochure-sm.pdf LISC MetroEdge brochure]&lt;/ref&gt; employ variants of ILD, but none has applied this internationally except for PERC.

This development model is gaining traction in emerging markets such as Colombia and South Africa, where the data is being used to reduce financial exclusion and facilitate credit access as a means to build wealth and form assets. It is also attracting increasing attention from development agencies, including [[USAID]], the [[International Finance Corporation]], the [[World Bank Group]], and the [[Consultative Group to Assist the Poor]].

The '''March 6–9, 1998 North American storm complex''', was a particularly powerful [[snowstorm]] originating on March 6. It was the biggest storm to hit [[Chicago]] since February 14, 1990, when 9.7 inches fell over two days. This storm dumped varying amounts of snow across the area. Chicago's [[Southwest Side, Chicago|Southwest Side]] was also hard hit, with 10.9 inches recorded at [[Midway International Airport]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3340">In [[fluid dynamics]], a '''moving shock''' is a [[shock wave]] that is travelling through a [[fluid]] (often [[gas]]eous) medium with a [[velocity]] relative to the velocity of the fluid already making up the medium.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Ascher H., ''Dynamics and Thermodynamics of Compressible Fluid Flow,'' Krieger Pub. Co; Reprint ed., with corrections (June 1983), {{ISBN|0-89874-566-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, the [[normal shock]] relations require modification to calculate the properties before and after the moving shock.  A knowledge of moving shocks is important for studying the phenomena surrounding [[detonation]], among other applications.

==Theory==
[[File:Moving shock.PNG|thumb|400px|This diagram shows the gas-relative and shock-relative velocities used for the theoretical moving shock equations.]]
To derive the theoretical equations for a moving shock, one may start by denoting the region in front of the shock as subscript 1, with the subscript 2 defining the region behind the shock.  This is shown in the figure, with the shock wave propagating to the right. 
The velocity of the gas is denoted by ''u'', [[pressure]] by ''p'', and the local [[speed of sound]] by ''a''.
The speed of the shock wave relative to the gas is ''W'', making the total velocity equal to ''u&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''W''.  

Next, suppose a [[frame of reference|reference frame]] is then fixed to the shock so it appears stationary as the gas in regions 1 and 2 move with a velocity relative to it.  Redefining region 1 as ''x'' and region 2 as ''y'' leads to the following shock-relative velocities:

:&lt;math&gt;\ u_y = W + u_1 - u_2,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ u_x = W.&lt;/math&gt;

With these shock-relative velocities, the properties of the regions before and after the shock can be defined below introducing the [[temperature]] as ''T'', the [[density]] as ''ρ'', and the [[Mach number]] as ''M'':

:&lt;math&gt;\ p_1 = p_x \quad ; \quad p_2 = p_y \quad ; \quad T_1 = T_x \quad ; \quad T_2 = T_y,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ \rho_1 = \rho_x \quad ; \quad \rho_2 = \rho_y \quad ; \quad a_1 = a_x \quad ; \quad a_2 = a_y,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ M_x = \frac{u_x}{a_x} = \frac{W}{a_1},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ M_y = \frac{u_y}{a_y} = \frac{W + u_1 - u_2}{a_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the [[heat capacity ratio]] as ''γ'', the [[speed of sound]], density, and pressure ratios can be derived:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2(\gamma - 1)}{(\gamma + 1)^2}\left[\gamma M_x^2 - \frac{1}{M_x^2} - (\gamma - 1)\right]},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} = \frac{1}{1-\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\left[1 - \frac{1}{M_x^2}\right]},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{p_2}{p_1} = 1 + \frac{2\gamma}{\gamma + 1}\left[M_x^2 - 1\right].&lt;/math&gt;

One must keep in mind that the above equations are for a shock wave moving towards the right.  For a shock moving towards the left, the ''x'' and ''y'' subscripts must be switched and:

:&lt;math&gt;\ u_y = W - u_1 + u_2,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ M_y = \frac{W - u_1 + u_2}{a_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

{{Fats}}
'''Omega-9 fatty acids''' ('''ω−9 fatty acids''' or '''''n''−9 fatty acids''') are a family of [[unsaturated fat|unsaturated]] [[fatty acid]]s which have in common a final carbon–carbon [[double bond#Bond order|double bond]] in the [[essential fatty acid#Nomenclature and terminology|omega−9]] position; that is, the ninth bond from the [[methyl]] end of the fatty acid.

==Background==
Some omega−9 fatty acids are common components of [[animal fat]] and [[vegetable oil]]. 
Two omega−9 fatty acids important in industry are: 
* [[Oleic acid]] (18:1, ''n''−9), which is a main component of [[olive oil]], [[macadamia oil]] and other [[monounsaturated fat]]s
* [[Erucic acid]] (22:1, ''n''−9), which is found in [[rapeseed]], [[wallflower]] seed, and [[mustard seed]].  Rapeseed with high erucic acid content is grown  for commercial use in paintings and coatings as a [[drying oil]]. [[Canola oil]] comes from a [[cultivar]] of the rapeseed plant that has been bred, or in some cases genetically modified, to contain very little erucic acid.

Unlike [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s and [[omega-6 fatty acid]], omega−9 fatty acids are not classed as [[essential fatty acids]]  (EFA).  This is both because they can be created by the human body from [[unsaturated fat]], and are therefore not essential in the diet, and because the lack of an omega−6 double bond keeps them from participating in the reactions that form the [[eicosanoid]]s.

Under severe conditions of EFA deprivation, mammals will elongate and desaturate oleic acid to make [[mead acid]], (20:3, ''n''−9).&lt;ref name="lipomics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lipomics.com/resources/fatty_acids/20_3n9.htm |author=Lipomics|title = Mead acid| accessdate= February 14, 2006}}{{dead link |date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been documented to a lesser extent in one study following [[vegetarians]] and [[Semi-vegetarianism|semi-vegetarians]] who followed diets without substantial sources of EFA.&lt;ref name="phinney1990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Phinney SD, Odin RS, Johnson SB, Holman RT |title=Reduced arachidonate in serum phospholipids and cholesteryl esters associated with vegetarian diets in humans |journal=Am.

'''Permalloy''' is a [[nickel]]–[[iron]] magnetic [[alloy]],  with about 80% nickel and 20% iron content.  Invented in 1914 by physicist Gustav Elmen at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]],&lt;ref name="Elmen"&gt;{{cite journal

Commercial permalloy alloys typically have [[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Relative permeability|relative permeability]] of around 100,000, compared to several thousand for ordinary steel.&lt;ref name="Jiles"&gt;{{cite book

In addition to high permeability, its other magnetic properties are low [[coercivity]], near zero [[magnetostriction]], and significant [[anisotropic]] [[magnetoresistance]]. The low magnetostriction is critical for industrial applications, allowing it to be used in thin films where variable stresses would otherwise cause a ruinously large variation in magnetic properties. Permalloy's electrical [[resistivity]] can vary as much as 5% depending on the strength and the direction of an applied [[magnetic field]].  Permalloys typically have the [[face centered cubic]] crystal structure with a lattice constant of approximately 0.355 nm in the vicinity of a nickel concentration of 80%.  A disadvantage of permalloy is that it is not very [[ductility|ductile]] or workable, so applications requiring elaborate shapes, such as magnetic shields, are made of other high permeability alloys such as [[mu metal]].  Permalloy is used in [[transformer]] [[Magnetic core|laminations]] and magnetic [[recording head]]s.

==Development==
[[Image:Permalloy cable.svg|thumb|right|300px|Submarine telegraph cable wrapped with permalloy tape.]]
Permalloy was initially developed in the early 20th century for [[Inductance|inductive]] compensation of [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] cables.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the first transatlantic [[submarine telegraph cable]]s were laid in the 1860s, it was found that the long conductors caused distortion which reduced the maximum signalling speed to only 10–12 words per minute.&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; The right conditions for transmitting signals through cables without distortion were first worked out mathematically in 1885 by [[Oliver Heaviside]].&lt;ref name="Bragg"&gt;Bragg, L. ''Electricity'' (London: G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1943) p. 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was proposed by [[Carl Emil Krarup]] in 1902 in Denmark that the cable could be compensated by wrapping it with iron wire, increasing the [[inductance]] and making it a [[loaded line]] to reduce distortion.  However, iron did not have high enough permeability to compensate a transatlantic-length cable.   After a prolonged search, permalloy was discovered in 1914 by [[Gustav Elmen]] of [[Bell Laboratories]], who found it had higher permeability than [[silicon steel]].&lt;ref name="Elmen" /&gt;  Later, in 1923, he found its permeability could be greatly enhanced by [[heat treatment]].&lt;ref name=" Elmen2"&gt;{{cite journal

This method of cable compensation declined in the 1930s, but by World War 2 many other uses for Permalloy were found in the electronics industry.

==Other compositions==
Other compositions of permalloy are available, designated by a numerical prefix denoting the percentage of [[nickel]] in the [[alloy]], for example "45 permalloy" means an alloy containing 45% [[nickel]], and 55% [[iron]]. "Molybdenum permalloy" is an [[alloy]] of 81% [[nickel]], 17% [[iron]] and 2% [[molybdenum]]. The latter was invented at [[Bell Labs]] in 1940. At the time, when used in long distance copper telegraph lines, it allowed a tenfold increase in maximum line working speed.&lt;ref name="Bragg" /&gt; [[Supermalloy]], at 79% Ni, 16% Fe, and 5% Mo, is also well known for its high performance as a "soft" magnetic material, characterized by high permeability and low coercivity.

A '''phase diagram''' in [[physical chemistry]], [[engineering]], [[mineralogy]], and [[materials science]] is a type of [[chart]] used to show conditions (pressure, temperature, volume, etc.) at which thermodynamically distinct [[phase (matter)|phases]] (such as solid, liquid or gaseous states) occur and coexist at [[thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]].

== Overview ==
Common components of a phase diagram are ''lines of equilibrium'' or ''phase boundaries'', which refer to lines that mark conditions under which multiple phases can coexist at equilibrium.  Phase transitions occur along lines of equilibrium.

[[Triple point]]s are points on phase diagrams where lines of equilibrium intersect.  Triple points mark conditions at which three different phases can coexist.  For example, the water phase diagram has a triple point corresponding to the single temperature and pressure at which solid, liquid, and gaseous water can coexist in a stable equilibrium ({{val|273.16|ul=K}} and a partial vapor pressure of {{val|611.657|ul=Pa}}).

The [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] is the temperature below which the substance is stable in the solid state. The [[liquidus]] is the temperature above which the substance is stable in a liquid state. There may be a gap between the solidus and liquidus; within the gap, the substance consists of a mixture of crystals and liquid (like a "[[slurry]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Predel |first=Bruno |last2=Hoch |first2=Michael J. R. |last3=Pool |first3=Monte |year=2004 |title=Phase Diagrams and Heterogeneous Equilibria: A Practical Introduction |publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]] |isbn=3-540-14011-5}}&lt;!-- Reference 1 covers most of the article.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Working fluids]] are often categorized by on the basis of the shape of their phase diagram.

== Types ==

=== 2-dimensional diagrams ===
[[Image:Phase-diag2.svg|thumb|310x310px|A typical phase diagram. The solid green line applies to most substances; the dotted green line gives [[Water (molecule)#Density of water and ice|the anomalous behavior of water]].  The green lines mark the [[freezing point]] and the blue line the [[boiling point]], showing how they vary with pressure.]]The simplest phase diagrams are pressure–temperature diagrams of a single simple substance, such as [[water (molecule)|water]]. The [[Cartesian coordinate system|axes]] correspond to the [[pressure]] and [[temperature]]. The phase diagram shows, in pressure–temperature space, the lines of equilibrium or phase boundaries between the three phases of [[solid]], [[liquid]], and [[gas]].

The curves on the phase diagram show the points where the free energy (and other derived properties) becomes non-analytic: their derivatives with respect to the coordinates (temperature and pressure in this example) change discontinuously (abruptly). For example, the heat capacity of a container filled with ice will change abruptly as the container is heated past the melting point.  The open spaces, where the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] is [[analytic function|analytic]], correspond to single phase regions. Single phase regions are separated by lines of non-analytical behavior, where [[phase transition]]s occur, which are called '''phase boundaries'''.

In the diagram on the right, the phase boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely. Instead, it terminates at a point on the phase diagram called the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. This reflects the fact that, at extremely high temperatures and pressures, the liquid and gaseous phases become indistinguishable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. |last=Papon |first2=J. |last2=Leblond |first3=P. H. E. |last3=Meijer |title=The Physics of Phase Transition : Concepts and Applications |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |year=2002 |isbn=3-540-43236-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in what is known as a [[supercritical fluid]]. In water, the critical point occurs at around ''T''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = {{convert|647.096|K|C}}, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = {{convert|22.064|MPa|atm|abbr=on}} and ''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 356&amp;nbsp;kg/m³.&lt;ref&gt;The International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam [http://www.iapws.org/relguide/fundam.pdf "Guideline on the Use of Fundamental Physical Constants and Basic Constants of Water"], 2001, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of the liquid–gas critical point reveals a slight ambiguity in labelling the single phase regions. When going from the liquid to the gaseous phase, one usually crosses the phase boundary, but it is possible to choose a path that never crosses the boundary by going to the right of the critical point. Thus, the liquid and gaseous phases can blend continuously into each other. The solid–liquid phase boundary can only end in a critical point if the solid and liquid phases have the same [[symmetry group]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

For most substances, the solid–liquid phase boundary (or fusion curve) in the phase diagram has a positive [[slope]] so that the melting point increases with pressure. This is true whenever the solid phase is [[Density|denser]] than the liquid phase.&lt;ref name=Whitten&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whitten |first1=Kenneth W. |last2=Galley |first2=Kenneth D.  |last3=Davis |first3=Raymond E. |date=1992 |title=General Chemistry. |edition=4th |page=477 |publisher=Saunders College Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greater the pressure on a given substance, the closer together the molecules of the substance are brought to each other, which increases the effect of the substance's [[intermolecular forces]]. Thus, the substance requires a higher temperature for its molecules to have enough energy to break out of the fixed pattern of the solid phase and enter the liquid phase. A similar concept applies to liquid–gas phase changes.&lt;ref name=Dorin&gt;{{cite book |title=Chemistry : The Study of Matter Prentice |last1=Dorin |first1=Henry |last2=Demmin |first2=Peter E. |last3=Gabel |first3=Dorothy L. |edition=Fourth |pages=266–273 |isbn=0-13-127333-7 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Water is an exception which has a solid-liquid boundary with negative slope so that the melting point decreases with pressure. This occurs because ice (solid water) is less dense than liquid water, as shown by the fact that ice floats on water. At a molecular level, ice is less dense because it has a more extensive network of [[hydrogen bond]]ing which requires a greater separation of water molecules.&lt;ref name=Whitten/&gt; Other exceptions are [[antimony]] and [[bismuth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Averill |first1=Bruce A. |last2=Eldredge |first2=Patricia |date=2012 |title=Principles of General Chemistry |chapter=11.7 Phase Diagrams |chapter-url=https://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/s15-07-phase-diagrams.html |publisher=Creative Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Petrucci |first1=Ralph H. |last2=Harwood |first2=William S.  |last3=Herring |first3=F. Geoffrey |date=2002 |title=General Chemistry. Principles and Modern Applications |edition=8th |page=477 |publisher=Prentice Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of the slope dP/dT is given by the [[Clausius–Clapeyron relation|Clapeyron equation]] for fusion (melting)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laidler |first1=Keith J. |last2=Meiser |first2=John H. |date=1982 |title=Physical Chemistry |pages=173-4 |publisher=Benjamin/Cummings}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}T} = \frac{\Delta_{fus} H}{T\,\Delta_{fus} V}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ΔH&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; is the heat of fusion which is always positive, and ΔV&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume change for fusion. For most substances ΔV&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; is positive so that the slope is positive. However for water and other exceptions, ΔV&lt;sub&gt;fus&lt;/sub&gt; is negative so that the slope is negative.

====Other thermodynamic properties====
In addition to temperature and pressure, other thermodynamic properties may be graphed in phase diagrams.  Examples of such thermodynamic properties include [[specific volume]], [[specific enthalpy]], or specific [[entropy]].  For example, single-component graphs of temperature vs. specific entropy (''T'' vs. ''s'') for water/[[steam]] or for a [[refrigerant]] are commonly used to illustrate [[thermodynamic cycle]]s such as a [[Carnot cycle]], [[Rankine cycle]], or [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle.

In a [[two-dimensional graph]], two of the thermodynamic quantities may be shown on the horizontal and vertical axes. Additional thermodynamic quantities may each be illustrated in increments as a series of lines - curved, straight, or a combination of curved and straight. Each of these '''iso-'''lines represents the thermodynamic quantity at a certain constant value.

The critical point is at the top of the dome. Liquid water is to the left of the dome. Steam is to the right of the dome. The blue lines/curves are '''isobars''' showing constant pressure. The green lines/curves are '''isochors''' showing constant specific volume. The red curves show constant quality.]]

===3-dimensional diagrams===
[[File:pVT 3D diagram.png|thumb|200px|''p''–''v''–''T'' 3D diagram for fixed amount of pure material]]
It is possible to envision three-dimensional (3D) graphs showing three thermodynamic quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zemansky |first1=Mark W. |last2=Dittman |first2=Richard H. |year=1981 |title=Heat and Thermodynamics |edition=6th |at=Figs. 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 10-10, P10-1 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=0-07-072808-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Web applet: [http://biomodel.uah.es/Jmol/plots/phase-diagrams/ 3D Phase Diagrams for Water, Carbon Dioxide and Ammonia]. Described in {{cite journal |last1=Glasser |first1=Leslie |last2=Herráez |first2=Angel |last3=Hanson |first3=Robert M. |year=2009 |title=Interactive 3D Phase Diagrams Using Jmol |journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education]] |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=566 |doi=10.1021/ed086p566}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for a single component, a 3D Cartesian coordinate type graph can show temperature (''T'') on one axis, pressure (''p'') on a second axis, and specific volume (''v'') on a third.  Such a 3D graph is sometimes called a ''p''–''v''–''T'' diagram. The equilibrium conditions are shown as curves on a curved surface in 3D with areas for solid, liquid, and vapor phases and areas where solid and liquid, solid and vapor, or liquid and vapor coexist in equilibrium. A line on the surface called a '''triple line''' is where solid, liquid and vapor can all coexist in equilibrium. The critical point remains a point on the surface even on a 3D phase diagram.

For water, the 3D ''p''–''v''–''T'' diagram is seen here:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=David |first1=Carl |title=Verwiebe's "3-D" Ice phase diagram reworked |url=http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/chem_educ/94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

An [[orthographic projection]] of the 3D ''p''–''v''–''T'' graph showing pressure and temperature as the vertical and horizontal axes collapses the 3D plot into the standard 2D pressure–temperature diagram. When this is done, the solid–vapor, solid–liquid, and liquid–vapor surfaces collapse into three corresponding curved lines meeting at the triple point, which is the collapsed orthographic projection of the triple line.

===Binary mixtures===
Other much more complex types of phase diagrams can be constructed, particularly when more than one pure component is present. In that case, [[concentration]] becomes an important variable.  Phase diagrams with more than two dimensions can be constructed that show the effect of more than two variables on the phase of a substance. Phase diagrams can use other variables in addition to or in place of temperature, pressure and composition, for example the strength of an applied electrical or magnetic field, and they can also involve substances that take on more than just three states of matter.
[[Image:Brosen ironcarbon.svg|thumb|250px|left|The iron–iron carbide (Fe–Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C) phase diagram. The percentage of carbon present and the temperature define the phase of the iron carbon alloy and therefore its physical characteristics and mechanical properties. The percentage of carbon determines the type of the ferrous alloy: iron, steel or cast iron]]
[[Image:Eutektikum new.svg|thumb|right|250px|A phase diagram for a binary system displaying a eutectic point.]]

One type of phase diagram plots temperature against the relative concentrations of two substances in a [[Wiktionary:binary|binary]] [[mixture]] called a ''binary phase diagram'', as shown at right. Such a mixture can be either a [[solid solution]], [[eutectic point|eutectic]] or [[peritectic]], among others. These two types of mixtures result in very different graphs. Another type of binary phase diagram is a ''boiling-point diagram'' for a mixture of two components, i. e. [[chemical compound]]s. For two particular [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] components at a certain pressure such as [[atmospheric pressure]], a boiling-point diagram shows what [[vapor]] (gas) compositions are in [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium|equilibrium]] with given liquid compositions depending on temperature.  In a typical binary boiling-point diagram, temperature is plotted on a vertical axis and mixture composition on a horizontal axis.
[[Image:Binary Boiling Point Diagram new.svg|thumb|250px|right|Boiling-point diagram]]

A simple example diagram with hypothetical components 1 and 2 in a non-[[Azeotrope|azeotropic]] mixture is shown at right.  The fact that there are two separate curved lines joining the boiling points of the pure components means that the vapor composition is usually not the same as the liquid composition the vapor is in equilibrium with. See [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium#Boiling-point diagrams|Vapor–liquid equilibrium]] for more information.

In addition to the above-mentioned types of phase diagrams, there are thousands of other possible combinations. Some of the major features of phase diagrams include congruent points, where a solid phase transforms directly into a liquid. There is also the [[peritectoid]], a point where two solid phases combine into one solid phase during cooling. The inverse of this, when one solid phase transforms into two solid phases during cooling, is called the eutectoid.

A complex phase diagram of great technological importance is that of the [[iron]]–[[carbon]] system for less than 7% carbon (see [[steel]]).

The x-axis of such a diagram represents the concentration variable of the mixture. As the mixtures are typically far from dilute and their density as a function of temperature is usually unknown, the preferred concentration measure is [[mole fraction]]. A volume-based measure like [[molarity]] would be inadvisable.

===Crystals===
[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphic]] and [[Polyamorphism|polyamorphic]] substances have multiple [[crystal]] or [[amorphous]] phases, which can be graphed in a similar fashion to solid, liquid, and gas phases.

[[Image:Phase diagram of water.svg|thumb|700px|centre|[[Semi-log plot|Log-lin]] pressure–temperature phase diagram of water. The [[Roman numeral]]s indicate various [[Ice#Phases|ice phases]]. A similar diagram may be found on the site Water structure and science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_phase_diagram.html Water structure and science] Site by Martin Chaplin, accessed 2 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Mesophases===
Some organic materials pass through intermediate states between solid and liquid; these states are called [[mesophase]]s. Attention has been directed to mesophases because they enable [[display device]]s and have become commercially important through the so-called [[liquid crystal|liquid-crystal]] technology. Phase diagrams are used to describe the occurrence of mesophases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chandrasekhar |first1=Sivaramakrishna  |author-link= Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar |year=1992 |title=Liquid Crystals |edition=2nd |pages=27–29, 356 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-41747-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Piñatex''' is a [[artificial leather|natural leather alternative]] made from cellulose fibres extracted from [[pineapple]] [[Leaf|leaves]], '''Piñatex''' was developed by Dr Carmen Hijosa and first presented at the PhD graduate exhibition at the [[Royal College of Art]], London. Piñatex is manufactured and distributed by Dr Hijosa's company Ananas Anam Ltd.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2016/06/09/pinatex-ananas-anam-vegan-leather-alternative-ethical-recycled-pineapple-leaves-sustainable-materials-design-camper/|title=Leather alternative Piñatex is made from pineapple leaves|date=9 June 2016|website=Dezeen|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Piñatex's development began when Dr Hijosa was working as consultant in the leather goods industry in the Philippines in the 1990s. She observed the leather produced there by was poor quality, environmentally unsustainable and bad for the people involved in the industry.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcoexist.com/3059190/this-gorgeous-sustainable-leather-is-made-from-pineapple-waste|title=This Gorgeous, Sustainable "Leather" Is Made From Pineapple Waste|date=25 April 2016|access-date=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Hijosa was by the [[barong tagalog]], a traditional transparent garment worn over shirts in the Philippines made of pineapple fibres. She then spent seven years developing the product through a PhD at the Royal College of Art in London, and joint collaborations with [[Bangor University]] in Wales, Northampton Leather Technology Center, Leitat Technological Centre in Spain, alongside NonWoven Philippines Inc. in Manila, and Bonditex S.A., a textile finishing company in Spain.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clearlyveg.com/blog/2016/02/27/vegan-leather-made-pineapples-cruelty-free-and-biodegradable|title=Vegan Leather Made From Pineapples is Cruelty-Free and Biodegradable|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/21/wearable-pineapple-leather-alternative|title=Wearable pineapple fibres could prove sustainable alternative to leather|last=Hickey|first=Shane|date=21 December 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Piñatex is created by felting the long fibres from pineapple leaves together to create a non-woven substrate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/science/leather-alternative-replaces-animal-hide-with-pineapple-leaves-1653287/|title=Leather alternative replaces animal hide with pineapple leaves {{!}} Science! {{!}} Geek.com|website=@geekdotcom|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pineapple industry globally produces 40,000 tonnes of waste pineapple leaves each year, which are usually left to rot or are burned.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Approximately 480 leaves (the waste from 16 pineapple plants) are needed to create 1 square metre of material. The material uses the long leaf fibres which are separated by the pineapple farmers for additional income, the leftover biomass from the process can be used as a fertiliser.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Because Piñatex is produced from a waste product it requires no additional land, water, pesticides or fertilizers. It also avoids the use of toxic chemicals and heavy metals used in animal leather production and has none of the wastage of leather caused by the shape of the animal's skin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Properties ==
Piñatex is produced in a range of colours and finishes, including a textured surface and a metallic finish. It has been described as having a softer, more pliable, "leather-like" texture than other synthetic leathers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Alice|date=16 June 2018|title=Insight Vegan Clothes: What not to wear|url=|journal=New Scientist|volume=238|issue=3182|pages=22-23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be cut, stitched, embossed and embroidered for different design uses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Piñatex is [[Veganism|vegan]] and unlike petroleum based synthetic leather, the base mesh is compostable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== In manufactured goods ==
Piñatex is breathable and flexible. It has been used in the manufacture of such products as bags, shoes, wallets, watch bands, and seat covers. The textile is being further developed for use in clothing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Products have been produced by designer [[Ally Capellino]], LIAN &amp; LIV, Time IV Change, ROMBAUT, and Nae; prototypes have been created by [[Puma SE|Puma]] and Camper.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Bourgeois Boheme, a vegan footwear label, uses Piñatex in their sandals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Recognition ==
In 2016 Piñatex won the [[Arts Foundation UK]] award for Material Innovation and in 2015 Dr Hijosa was finalists of the [[Cartier Women's Initiative Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://award-editions.cartierwomensinitiative.com/award-editions/2015/carmen-hijosa|title=Carmen Hijosa {{!}} Award Editions|website=award-editions.cartierwomensinitiative.com|access-date=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Piñatex is a [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] certified [[Veganism|vegan]] fashion label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ananas-anam.com/about/|title=Our Company – ananas anam|access-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pineapple leather was highlighted on the first page of, and throughout, L.J.M. Owen's book, ''[[Dr Pimms, Intermillennial Sleuth|Egyptian Enigma]]''. It was the featured fabric on a journal gifted to the main character, Dr. Elizabeth Pimms, by her sister Sam Pimms, an ardent vegetarian.

A '''potbelly stove''' is a [[cast iron|cast-iron]] [[wood-burning stove]], round with a bulge in the middle. The name is derived from the resemblance of the stove to that of a fat man's [[Abdominal obesity|pot belly]]. They were designed to heat large spaces and were often found in [[train station]]s or [[One-room school|one-room schoolhouses]]. The flat top of the fireplace allowed for cooking of food, or the heating of water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36970">A '''Renewable Portfolio Standard''' (RPS) is a [[regulation]] that requires the increased production of [[energy]] from [[renewable resource|renewable energy sources]], such as [[Wind energy|wind]], [[Solar power|solar]], [[biomass]], and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]]. The federal RPS is called the '''Renewable Electricity Standard''' (RES).

The RPS mechanism generally places an obligation on [[electricity supply]] companies to produce a specified fraction of their electricity from renewable energy sources. Certified renewable energy generators earn certificates for every [[Units of measurement|unit]] of electricity they produce and can sell these along with their electricity to supply companies. Supply companies then pass the certificates to some form of regulatory body to demonstrate their compliance with their regulatory obligations. Because it is a [[Market (economics)|market]] mandate, the RPS relies almost entirely on the private market for its implementation. Unlike [[feed-in tariff]]s which guarantee purchase of all renewable energy regardless of cost, RPS programs tend to allow more price competition between different types of renewable energy, but can be limited in competition through eligibility and multipliers for RPS programs. Those supporting the adoption of RPS mechanisms claim that market implementation will result in competition, efficiency, and innovation that will deliver renewable energy at the lowest possible cost, allowing renewable energy to compete with cheaper [[fossil fuel]] energy sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awea.org/policy/rpsbrief.html awea.org &gt;&gt; Policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202081631/http://www.awea.org/policy/rpsbrief.html |date=2007-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RPS programs have been adopted in 29 of 50 [[U.S. state]]s,  and the [[District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name="mjbeck.emtoolbox.com"&gt;[http://mjbeck.emtoolbox.com/?page=Renewable_Portfolio_Standards Compare State Renewable Portfolio Standard Programs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program diversity==
Of all the state-based RPS programs in place today, no two are the same.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Each has been designed taking into account state-specific policy objectives (e.g.  economic growth, diversity of energy supply, environmental concerns), local resource endowment, political considerations, and the capacity to expand renewable energy production. At the most basic level, this gives rise to differing RPS targets and years (e.g. Arizona's 15% by 2025 and Colorado's 30% by 2020).&lt;ref&gt;http://dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=CO24R&amp;re=1&amp;ee=1&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors in program design include resource eligibility, in-state requirements, new build requirements, technology favoritism, lobbying by industry associations and non-profits, groups cost caps, program coverage (IOUs versus Cooperatives and Municipal utilities), cost recovery by utilities, penalties for non-compliance, rules regarding REC creation and trading, and additional non-binding goals. Since RPS programs create a mandate to purchase renewable energy, they create a lucrative [[captive market]] of buyers for renewable energy producers who are eligible in a particular state's RPS program to issue RECs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} A state may choose to promote new investment in renewable energy generation capacity by not making eligible existing renewable energy such as hydroelectric plants or geothermal energy to qualify under an RPS program.&lt;ref name="mjbeck.emtoolbox.com"/&gt;

Many states that have mandatory Renewable Portfolio Standards also have additional voluntary targets either for the total proportion of renewable energy or for a particular technology type.&lt;ref name="M.J. Beck RPS Edge"&gt;[http://mjbeck.emtoolbox.com/?page=Renewable_Portfolio_Standards M.J. Beck RPS Edge]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many states, municipalities and cooperatives are exempt from the RPS target, have a lower target, or are required to develop their own targets. Furthermore, in some states such as Minnesota, individual utilities (e.g., Xcel Energy) are singled out for special treatment.&lt;ref name="M.J. Beck RPS Edge"/&gt;

==Renewable energy certificates (RECs)==
States with RPS programs have associated [[Renewable Energy Certificate (United States)|renewable energy certificate]] trading programs. RECs provide a mechanism by which to track the amount of renewable power being sold and to financially reward eligible power producers. For each unit of power that an eligible producer generates, a certificate or credit is issued. These can then be sold either in conjunction with the underlying power or separately to energy supply companies. A market exists for RECs because energy supply companies are required to redeem certificates equal to their obligation under the RPS program. State specific programs or various applications (e.g., WREGIS, M-RETS, NEPOOL GIS) are used to track REC issuance and ownership. These credits can in some programs be 'banked' (for use in future years) or borrowed (to meet current year commitments). There is a great deal of variety among the states in the handling and functioning of RECs and this will be a major issue in integrating state and federal programs.&lt;ref name="M.J. Beck RPS Edge"/&gt;

===Multipliers===
RPS multipliers are powerful tools for regulators to direct revenue, investment, and job creation to particular types of renewable energy vs a free market of renewable energy. Since the definition of what is renewable energy isn't clear cut, for example, [[Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|nuclear power]], and whether an RPS program should consider environmental damage of a renewable energy source (for example, hydroelectric dams, bird strikes of wind turbines, [[Enhanced geothermal systems#Seismicity|geothermal earthquakes]], solar thermal water use) affects RPS program implementations. A state can use a multiplier as [[protectionism]] to local renewable energy generators from out of state renewable generators. Since RECs are regulated at a state level, their ability to be traded over state lines varies.&lt;ref name="M.J. Beck RPS Edge"/&gt;

===Solar renewable energy certificates (SRECs)===
Over 16 of the approximately 30 states with RPS programs have also established a set-aside for solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=21 DSIRE Solar Set-Asides in Renewable Portfolio Standards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021172843/http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=21 |date=2012-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in the creation and trading of RECs specific to solar known as [[solar renewable energy certificate]]s (SRECs). With a separate market for SRECs, states are able to ensure that a portion of their renewable energy comes from solar. As a result, states with solar carve-outs, such as New Jersey, have had more success in promoting solar energy through the RPS than states, such as Texas, with a generic REC market or REC multiplier.

===Tiers and set-asides===
Energy supply companies need to show that they have acquired a particular percentage of their power sales from the designated technology type. Multiple technology types are bundled together in 'tiers' or 'classes' with similar effect. Not all states have set-asides or tiers (some preferring to promote particular technologies through credit multipliers) and each state that groups technologies together in a tier does so differently.&lt;ref name="M.J. Beck RPS Edge"/&gt;

===Eligible technologies===
Every state defines 'renewable' technologies differently. Many states exclude existing renewable facilities from benefiting from an RPS program for the same reason. A state's definition of eligible technologies is also driven by the objectives of the program. Programs designed to promote diversity in generation types may include or promote technologies different from programs designed to achieve environmental goals.&lt;ref name="M.J. Beck RPS Edge"/&gt;

In a 2011 report published by the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]], Doug Koplow said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nuclear power should not be eligible for inclusion in a renewable portfolio standard. Nuclear power is an established, [[mature technology]] with a long history of government support. Furthermore, nuclear plants are unique in their potential to cause catastrophic damage (due to accidents, sabotage, or terrorism); to produce very long-lived radioactive wastes; and to exacerbate nuclear proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nuclear_power/nuclear_subsidies_report.pdf |title=Nuclear Power:Still Not Viable without Subsidies |author=Koplow, Doug |date=February 2011 |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United Nations]] classifies a particular subset of presently operating nuclear fission technologies as renewable. Reactors that produce more [[fissile]] fuel than they consume - [[breeder reactor]]s and, eventually, [[nuclear fusion]], are classified within the same category as conventional renewable energy sources, such as [[Sun|solar]] and [[Hydropower|falling water]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm Today's primary sources of energy are mainly non-renewable: natural gas, oil, coal, peat, and conventional nuclear power. There are also renewable sources, including wood, plants, dung, falling water, geothermal sources, solar, tidal, wind, and wave energy, as well as human and animal muscle-power. '''Nuclear reactors that produce their own fuel ('breeders') and eventually fusion reactors are also in this category'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penalties===
In order to motivate compliance, states that have enforceable standards will have penalties for utilities that fail to reach the specified targets. States may choose to set penalty values or make arbitrary penalty amounts when suppliers fail to meet a renewable target. Where specific technologies are promoted through either tiers or set-aside provisions, the penalties for missing these targets are typically separate and higher. Some states have higher penalties for repeat violations and others escalate penalties on a yearly basis according to price indices.&lt;ref name="M.J. Beck RPS Edge"/&gt;

===Cost caps===
All states either place caps on the cost of the program or include some form of 'escape clause' whereby the regulatory authority can suspend the program or exempt utilities from meeting its requirements. The need for such measures arises from the difficulties in estimating in advance the actual cost of the RPS program. The realized cost to the utility and the ratepayer is not known until the supply and cost base of renewable power, along with actual demand, is established.&lt;ref name="M.J. Beck RPS Edge"/&gt; However, likely costs can be estimated, and some states appear to have set cost caps low enough that complete RPS requirements could not be fulfilled without a significant decrease in renewables costs.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, S.D. and E.J. Moyer (2012). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1996621 "Feasibility of Renewable Portfolio Standards Under Cost Caps and Case Study for Illinois"]. ''Energy Policy'' 49, p. 499-514, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost recovery===
With few exceptions, utilities are allowed to recover the additional cost of procuring renewable power. The method by which this can be achieved varies by state. Some states opt for a ratepayer surcharge while others require utilities to include costs in rate base. In some instances, utilities are even able to recover the cost of penalties associated with non-compliance.&lt;ref name="M.J. Beck RPS Edge"/&gt;

===Policy by jurisdiction===
However, the federal government has discussed enacting a nationwide RPS in the future.  Such a policy would establish a common goal for every state in the country, which is less confusing than the state by state table below.  If the federal government does pass a national Renewable Portfolio Standard it could be problematic for some states.  Since each state has a unique environmental landscape, each state has different abilities when it comes to producing renewable energy.  States with less renewable resources available could be penalized for their lack of ability.

RPS mechanisms have tended to be most successful in stimulating new renewable energy capacity in the United States where they have been used in combination with federal Production [[tax credit|Tax Credits]] (PTC). In periods, where PTC have been withdrawn the RPS alone has often proven to be insufficient stimulus to incentivise large volumes of capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/ccpp/wind_web.pdf Wind Power: Barriers and Policy Solutions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927230907/http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/ccpp/wind_web.pdf |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal====
[[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act]]  is a law, passed in 1978 by the United States Congress as part of the [[National Energy Act]]. It is meant to promote{{clarify|date=January 2015}} greater use of renewable energy.

In 2009, the US Congress considered Federal level RPS requirements.  The "[[American Clean Energy and Security Act]]" reported out of committee in July by the Senate Committee on Energy &amp; Natural Resources includes a Renewable Electricity Standard that calls for 3% of U.S. electrical generation to come from non-hydro renewables by 2011–2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/07/house-and-senate-move-to-address-climate-and-energy-mixed-bag-for-clean-energy&lt;/ref&gt; However, the proposed [[Support Renewable Energy Act]] died in the 111th Congress.

In 2007, the [[Edison Electric Institute]], a [[trade association]] for America’s investor-owned utilities, reiterated their continuing opposition to a nationwide RPS; among the reasons included were that it conflicts with and preempts existing RES programs passed in many states, it does not adequately consider the uneven distribution of renewable resources across the country, and it creates inequities among utility customers, by specifically exempting all [[rural electric cooperatives]], and government-owned utilities from the RES mandate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eei.org/whatwedo/PublicPolicyAdvocacy/TFB%20Documents/070802KuhnHouseRenewable.pdf Oppose the Revised Udall 15% RPS Amendment], August 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC) has drafted the model bill [[Electricity Freedom Act]], which ALEC affiliate representatives are now attempting to roll out in various states and which "would end requirements for states to derive a specific percentage of their electricity needs from renewable energy sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gerhardt|first=Tina|date=1 February 2013|title=ALEC Targets Renewable Energy Standards and Global Warming Education|url=http://www.progressive.org/wind-and-solar-groups-flee-alec|work=[[The Progressive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, of being unable to stop the approval of this model legislation, the [[American Wind Energy Association]] and the [[Solar Energy Industry Association]] allowed their ALEC membership lapse after one year as members.

Different state RPS programs issue a different number of Renewable Energy Credits depending on the generation technology; for example, solar generation counts for twice as much as other renewable sources in Michigan and Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mjbeckconsulting.com/publications Challenges of Playing Favorites: State &amp; Federal RPS Programs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015030407/http://mjbeckconsulting.com/publications |date=October 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====California=====
The [[California]] Renewables Portfolio Standard was created in 2002 under Senate Bill 1078 and further accelerated in 2006 under Senate Bill 107. The bills stipulate that California electricity corporations must expand their renewable portfolio by 1% each year until reaching '''20%''' in 2010. On November&amp;nbsp;17, 2008, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed executive order S-14-08 which mandated a RPS of 33% by 2020 which sits in addition to the 20% by 2010 order.&lt;ref name="energy.ca.gov-1"&gt;[http://www.energy.ca.gov/portfolio/documents/documents/sb_107_bill_20060926_chaptered.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cpuc.ca.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/Renewables/index.htm |title=We're so sorry, your page was Not Found! |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307050124/http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/Renewables/index.htm |archivedate=March 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The target has been extended to 50% by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=8323 Biennial RPS Program Update] Section 913.6 Report | January 2016 | Page 4. '''CPUC'''&lt;/ref&gt; In September of 2018, [[Jerry Brown|Governor Jerry Brown]] signed legislation increasing the state's requirement to 100% renewable energy by 2045 and increasing the interim target to 60% by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/405903-california-passes-law-committing-state-to-100-renewable-energy-use|title=California commits to 100 percent renewable energy by 2045|last=Green|first=Miranda|date=2018-09-10|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Colorado=====
The Colorado Renewable Portfolio Standard was updated from 20% to 30% in the 2010 Legislative Session as House Bill 1001.  This increase is anticipated to increase solar industry jobs from current (2009) estimated 2,500 to 33,500 by 2020.  The updated RPS is also anticipated to create an additional $4.3B (U.S.) in state revenue within the industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_14650410 | work=Denver Post | title=Gov. Bill Ritter: Advancing Colorado's New Energy Economy | date=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Michigan=====
On October 6, 2008, Public Act 295 was signed into law in the State of Michigan. This Act, known as the Clean, Renewable and Efficient Energy Act, established a Renewable Energy Standard for the State of Michigan. The Renewable Energy Standard requires Michigan electric providers to achieve a retail supply portfolio that includes at least '''10%''' renewable energy by 2015.&lt;ref name="MichPA295"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/mpsc/0,4639,7-159-16393---,00.html|title=MPSC - Renewable Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ballot proposal to raise the standard to 25% renewable energy by 2025 as a constitutional amendment was put to the voters in the November 2012 General Election as Proposal 3. A Proposal To Amend the State Constitution to Establish a Standard for Renewable Energy.&lt;ref name="MichProp3"&gt;http://www.house.michigan.gov/hfa/PDFs/Ballot%20Proposal%202012-3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The ballot proposal was defeated with over 60% opposing the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/12GEN/90000003.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218202438/http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/12GEN/90000003.html |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the State of Michigan, as of March 4, 2013 "progress toward the first compliance year in 2012 and the 10 percent renewable energy standard in 2015 is going smoothly. Michigan’s electric providers are on track to meet the 10 percent renewable energy requirement. The renewable energy standard is resulting in the development of new renewable capacity and can be credited with the development of over 1,000 MW of new renewable energy projects becoming commercially operational since the Act became law. The weighted average price of renewable energy contracts is $82.54 per MWh which is less than forecasted in REPs."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mpsc/Report_on_the_implementation_of_Wind_energy_resource_zones_2013_413124_7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Nevada=====
In 1997 Nevada passed a Renewable Portfolio Standard as part of their 1997 Electric Restructuring Legislation (AB&amp;nbsp;366) It required any electric providers in the state to acquire actual renewable electric generation or purchase renewable energy credits so that each utility had 1&amp;nbsp;percent of total consumption in renewables. However, on June&amp;nbsp;8, 2001, Nevada Governor [[Kenny Guinn]] signed SB&amp;nbsp;372, at the time the country's most aggressive renewable portfolio standard. The law requires that '''15''' percent of all electricity generated in Nevada be derived from new renewables by the year 2013.&lt;ref name="newrules.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newrules.org/electricity/rpsnv.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013110257/http://newrules.org/electricity/rpsnv.html |archivedate=2008-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nevada RPS includes '''double goal'''. The 2001 revision requires that at least 5&amp;nbsp;percent of the renewable energy projects must generate electricity from solar energy.&lt;ref name="newrules.org"/&gt;

In June 2005, the Nevada legislature passed a bill during a special legislative session that modified the Nevada&amp;nbsp;RPS (Assembly Bill 03). The bill extends the deadline and raised the requirements of the RPS to 20&amp;nbsp;percent of sales by 2015.&lt;ref name="newrules.org"/&gt;

'''Florida'''&lt;br&gt;On Friday January 9, 2009 the Florida Public Service Commission unanimously agreed to require the state's utilities to generate 20&amp;nbsp;percent of their power from renewable resources by 2020.&lt;br&gt; This is still not law until the legislature approves.
This will drastically change the landscape for renewable energy applications for a state that gets less than 3&amp;nbsp;percent of its power from renewable energy. The proposal calls for 7&amp;nbsp;percent renewable energy by January 2013, 12&amp;nbsp;percent by 2016, 18&amp;nbsp;percent by 2019 and 20&amp;nbsp;percent by end of 2020.

=====Ohio=====
In an April 2008 unanimous vote, the Ohio legislature passed a bill requiring '''25''' percent of Ohio's energy to be generated from alternative and renewable sources, of which half or 12.5 percent must derive from renewable sources.&lt;ref name="ohio_renewable_energy_law"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2014, the state froze its RPS at 2.5 percent for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2014/06/13/the-freeze-is-on-kasich-signs-s-b-310-halts.html | title=The freeze is on – Kasich signs S.B. 310, halts renewable and energy-efficiency standards |date=June 13, 2014 | first=Tom |last=Knox |publisher=Columbus Business First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Oregon=====
For Oregon’s three largest utilities (Portland General Electric (PGE), PacifiCorp and the Eugene Water and Electric Board), the standard starts at 5% in 2011, increases to 15% in 2015, 20% in 2020, and 25% in 2025. Other electric utilities in the state, depending on size, have standards of 5% or 10% in 2025.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregon.gov/ENERGY/RENEW/RPS_Summary.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the target was raised to 50%, as two companies must supply 50% of Oregon's power as renewable by 2040.&lt;ref name=olis/&gt;

=====Texas=====
The [[Texas]] Renewable Portfolio Standard was originally created by Senate Bill 7 in 1999.  The Texas RPS mandated that utility companies jointly create 2000 new MWs of renewables by 2009 based on their market share. In 2005, Senate Bill 20, increased the state’s RPS requirement to 5,880&amp;nbsp;MW by 2015, of which, 500&amp;nbsp;MW must come from non-wind resources. The bill set a goal of 10,000&amp;nbsp;MW of renewable energy capacity for 2025. The state's installed capacity reached the 10,000 MW target in early 2010, 
15 years ahead of schedule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Texas Renewable Energy Industry|url=http://gov.texas.gov/files/ecodev/Renewable_Energy.pdf|publisher=Texas Economic Development and Tourism|accessdate=19 June 2015|page=5|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seaweed farming''' is the practice of cultivating and harvesting [[seaweed]]. In its simplest form, it consists of the management of naturally found batches. In its most advanced form, it consists of fully controlling the life cycle of the algae. The main food species grown by [[aquaculture]] in Japan, China and Korea include ''[[Gelidium]]'', ''[[Pterocladia]]'',{{sfn|Borgese|1980|p=111}} ''[[Porphyra]]'',{{sfn|Borgese|1980|p=112}} and ''[[Laminaria]]''.{{sfn|Borgese|1980|p=116}}  Seaweed farming has frequently been developed as an alternative to improve economic conditions and to reduce fishing pressure and over exploited fisheries. Seaweeds have been harvested throughout the world as a food source as well as an export commodity for production of [[agar]] and [[carrageenan]] products.{{sfn|Ask| 1999| p=52}}

==History==
Cultivation of ''[[Gim (food)|gim]]'' (laver) in [[Korea]] is reported in the books from 15th century, such as ''[[Sinjeung Dongguk Yeoji Seungnam|Revised and Augmented Survey of the Geography of Korea]]'' and ''[[Gyeongsang-do Jiriji|Geography of Gyeongsang Province]]''.&lt;ref name="Yi"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.krpia.co.kr/knowledge/itkc/detail?artClass=MK&amp;artId=kc_mk_g012|title=Sinjeung Dongguk Yeoji Seungnam|last=Yi|first=Haeng|year=1530|location=Joseon Korea|language=[[Literary Chinese]]|script-title=ko:신증동국여지승람(新增東國輿地勝覽)|trans-title=Revised and Augmented Survey of the Geography of Korea|orig-year=1481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ha"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gyeongsang-do Jiriji|last=Ha|first=Yeon|last2=Geum|first2=Yu|last3=Gim|first3=Bin|year=1425|location=Joseon Korea|language=ko|script-title=ko:경상도지리지(慶尙道地理志)|trans-title=Geography of Gyeongsang Province}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seaweed farming began in Japan as early as 1670 in [[Tokyo Bay]].{{sfn|Borgese|1980|p=112}} In autumn of each year, farmers would throw [[bamboo]] branches into shallow, muddy water, where the spores of the seaweed would collect. A few weeks later these branches would be moved to a river [[estuary]]. The nutrients from the river would help the seaweed to grow.{{sfn|Borgese|1980|p=112}}

In the 1940s, the Japanese improved this method by placing nets of synthetic material tied to bamboo poles. This effectively doubled the production.{{sfn|Borgese|1980|p=112}} A cheaper variant of this method is called the ''hibi'' method&amp;nbsp;— simple ropes stretched between bamboo poles.

Seaweed farming has been introduced to several different islands in Indonesia such as Rote island. The Australian government first brought agar seeds to Rote 15 years ago to keep locals out of poverty.

In the early 1970s there was a recognized demand for seaweed and seaweed products, outstripping supply, and cultivation was viewed as the best means to increase productions.{{sfn|Naylor| 1967|p= 73}}

==Culture methods==

The earliest seaweed farming guides in the Philippines recommended cultivation of ''[[Laminaria]]'' seaweed and reef flats at approximately one metre's depth at low tide. They also recommended cutting off sea grasses and removing sea urchins prior to farm construction. Seedlings are then tied to monofilament lines and strung between mangrove stakes pounded into the substrate. This off-bottom method is still one of the major methods used today.{{sfn|Crawford| 2002| p=2}}

There are new long-line cultivation methods that can be used in deeper water approximately 7 metres in depth. They use floating cultivation lines anchored to the bottom and are the primary methods used in the villages of [[North Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]].{{sfn|Pollnac| et al| 1997a| p= 67}}{{sfn|Pollnac| et al| 1997b| p= 79}}

Cultivation of seaweed in Asia is a relatively low-technology business with a high labour requirement. There have been many attempts in various countries to introduce high technology to cultivate detached plants growth in tanks on land in order to reduce labour, but they have yet to attain commercial viability.{{sfn|Crawford| 2002| p=2}}

==Environmental and ecological impacts==

Several environmental problems can result from seaweed farming. Sometimes seaweed farmers cut down [[mangroves]] to use as stakes for their ropes. This, however, negatively affects the farming since it reduces the water quality and mangrove biodiversity due to depletion. Farmers may also sometimes remove [[Zostera|eelgrass]] from their farming areas. This, however, is also discouraged, as it adversely affects water quality.{{sfn|Zertruche-Gonzalez|1997|p=53}}

Seaweed farming helps to preserve coral reefs,{{sfn|Zertruche-Gonzalez|1997|p=54}} by increasing diversity where the algae and seaweed have been introduced and it also provides added niche for local species of fish and invertebrates. Farming may be beneficial by increasing the production of herbivorous fishes and shellfish in the area.{{sfn|Ask| 1999| p=52}} {{harvnb|Pollnac| et al|1997b}} reported an increase in Siginid population after the start of extensive farming of [[eucheuma]] seaweed in villages in North Sulawesi, Indonesia.{{sfn|Pollnac| et al| 1997b| p= 79}}

Seaweed culture can also be used to capture, absorb, and eventually incorporate excessive nutrients into living tissue. "Nutrient bioextraction" is the preferred term for [[bioremediation]] involving cultured plants and animals. Nutrient bioextraction (also called bioharvesting) is the practice of farming and harvesting shellfish and seaweed for the purpose of removing nitrogen and other nutrients from natural water bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=NOAA|title=Nutrient Bioextraction Overview|url=http://longislandsoundstudy.net/issues-actions/water-quality/nutrient-bioextraction-overview/?doing_wp_cron=1369944259.2313320636749267578125|publisher=Long Island Sound Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (See main article [[Nutrient pollution]].)

Seaweed farming can be an actor in biological [[Carbon sequestration#Seaweed|carbon sequestration]].

==Societal impact==

[[File:PEI harvesting seaweed.JPG|thumb|right|230px|Harvesting seaweed in [[North Cape (Prince Edward Island)|North Cape]] (Canada)]]
The practice of seaweed farming has long since spread beyond Japan. In 1997, it was estimated that 40,000 people in the [[Philippines]] made their living through seaweed farming.{{sfn|Zertruche-Gonzalez|1997|p=54}} Cultivation is also common in all of southeast Asia, Canada, Great Britain, Spain, and the United States.{{sfn|Borgese|1980|p=111}}

==Socioeconomic aspects==

In Japan alone, annual production value of [[nori]] amounts to US$2 billion and is one of the world's most valuable crops produced by aquaculture. The high demand in seaweed production provides plentiful opportunities and work for the local community. A study conducted by the Philippines showed that plots of approximately one hectare can have a net income from [[eucheuma]] farming that was 5 to 6 times that of the minimum average wage of an agriculture worker. In the same study, they also saw an increase in seaweed exports from 675 metric tons (MT) in 1967 to 13,191 MT in 1980, which doubled to 28,000 MT by 1988.{{sfn|Trono| 1990| p=4}}

In industry, they are used as [[thickener]]s, components of some [[lubricant]]s, and precursors to [[catalyst]]s.

==Kinds of soaps==
Since they are salts of fatty acids, soaps have the general formula (RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt; (R is an [[alkyl]]). The major classification of soaps is determined by the identity of M&lt;sup&gt;n+&lt;/sup&gt;. When M is Na or K, the soaps are called toilet soaps, used for handwashing. Many metal [[dication]]s (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and others) give [[metallic soap]]. When M is Li, the result is [[lithium soap]] (e.g., [[lithium stearate]]), which is used in high-performance [[grease (lubricant)|greases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Klaus Schumann, Kurt Siekmann|title=Soaps|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a24_247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-toilet soaps===
Soaps are key components of most lubricating [[grease (lubricant)|greases]] and thickeners.  Greases are usually emulsions of [[calcium stearate|calcium soap]] or [[lithium soap]] and mineral oil.&lt;ref&gt;see the main [[Grease (lubricant)]] article&lt;/ref&gt; Many other metallic soaps are also useful, including those of aluminium, sodium, and mixtures thereof. Such soaps are also used as thickeners to increase the viscosity of oils. In ancient times, lubricating greases were made by the addition of [[lime (material)|lime]] to olive oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Thorsten Bartels et al.|title=Lubricants and Lubrication|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a15_423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal soaps are also included in modern artists' oil paints formulations as a [[rheology]] modifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn23/wn23-3/wn23-304.html|title=A Brief History of Aluminum Stearate as a Component of Paint|last=S.|first=Tumosa, Charles|date=2001-09-01|website=cool.conservation-us.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318085239/http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn23/wn23-3/wn23-304.html|archivedate=2017-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Production of metallic soaps====
Most heavy metal soaps are prepared by neutralization of purified fatty acids:
:2 RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  CaO   →   (RCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ca  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

===Toilet soaps===
In a domestic setting, "soap" usually refers to what is technically called a toilet soap, used for household and personal cleaning. When used for cleaning, soap solubilizes particles and grime, which can then be separated from the article being cleaned.
The insoluble oil/fat molecules become associated inside [[micelle]]s, tiny spheres formed from soap molecules with polar [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] (water-attracting) groups on the outside and encasing a [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] (fat-attracting) pocket, which shields the oil/fat molecules from the water making it soluble. Anything that is soluble will be washed away with the water.

[[Image:MicelleColor.png|thumb|300px|Structure of a [[micelle]], a cell-like structure formed by the aggregation of soap subunits (such as sodium stearate): The exterior of the micelle is hydrophilic (attracted to water) and the interior is lipophilic (attracted to oils).]]

====Production of toilet soaps====
The production of toilet soaps usually entails [[saponification]] of fats (triglycerides).  Triglycerides are vegetable or animal oils and fats.  An alkaline solution (often [[lye]] or [[sodium hydroxide]]) induces saponification whereby the triglyceride fats first [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] into salts of fatty acids.  [[Glycerol]] (glycerin) is liberated. The glycerin can remain in the soap product as a softening agent, although it is sometimes separated.&lt;ref name="Cavitch, Susan Miller 1994"&gt;Cavitch, Susan Miller. ''The Natural Soap Book''. Storey Publishing, 1994 {{ISBN|0-88266-888-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of alkali metal used determines the kind of soap product. Sodium soaps, prepared from [[sodium hydroxide]], are firm, whereas potassium soaps, derived from [[potassium hydroxide]], are softer or often liquid. Historically, potassium hydroxide was extracted from the ashes of [[bracken]] or other plants. Lithium soaps also tend to be hard. These are used exclusively in [[grease (lubricant)|grease]]s.

For making toilet soaps, [[triglyceride]]s (oils and fats) are derived from coconut, olive, or palm oils, as well as tallow.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;David J. Anneken, Sabine Both, Ralf Christoph, Georg Fieg, Udo Steinberner, Alfred Westfechtel "Fatty Acids" in Ullmann's ''Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a10_245.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triglyceride is the chemical name for the tri[[ester]]s of fatty acids and [[glycerin]]. [[Tallow]], ''i.e.,'' rendered beef fat, is the most available triglyceride from animals. Each species offers quite different fatty acid content, resulting in soaps of distinct feel. The seed oils give softer but milder soaps. Soap made from pure [[olive oil]], sometimes called [[Castile soap]] or [[Marseille soap]], is reputed for its particular mildness. The term "Castile" is also sometimes applied to soaps from a mixture of oils, but a high percentage of olive oil.

=====Ancient Middle East=====
[[File:MODOAmigo.jpg|thumb|Box for Amigo del Obrero (Worker's Friend) soap from the 20th century, part of the [[Museo del Objeto del Objeto]] collection]]
The earliest recorded evidence of the production of soap-like materials dates back to around 2800 BC in ancient [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Willcox | first = Michael | editor = Hilda Butler | title = Poucher's Perfumes, Cosmetics and Soaps | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4HI8dGHgeIQC&amp;pg=PA453 | isbn = 0-7514-0479-9 | edition = 10th | year = 2000 | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | location = Dordrecht | page = 453 | chapter = Soap | quote = The earliest recorded evidence of the production of soap-like materials dates back to around 2800 BCE in ancient Babylon. | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160820150103/https://books.google.com/books?id=4HI8dGHgeIQC&amp;pg=PA453 | archivedate = 2016-08-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A formula for soap consisting of water, [[alkali]], and [[Cinnamomum cassia|cassia]] oil was written on a Babylonian clay tablet around 2200 BC.

The [[Ebers papyrus]] (Egypt, 1550 BC) indicates the [[ancient Egypt]]ians bathed regularly and combined animal and vegetable oils with alkaline salts to create a soap-like substance. Egyptian documents mention a similar substance was used in the preparation of [[wool]] for weaving.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In the reign of [[Nabonidus]] (556–539 BC), a recipe for soap consisted of ''uhulu'' [ashes], cypress [oil] and sesame [seed oil] "for washing the stones for the servant girls".&lt;ref&gt;Noted in {{cite journal|author=Levey, Martin |title=Gypsum, salt and soda in ancient Mesopotamian chemical technology|journal=Isis|volume=49|issue=3|year=1958|pages=336–342 (341)|jstor=226942|doi=10.1086/348678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Roman Empire=====
The word ''sapo'', Latin for soap, likely was borrowed from an early Germanic language and is [[cognate]] with Latin ''sebum'', "[[tallow]]". It first appears in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=soap soaps p] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208192853/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=soap |date=2011-02-08 }}. Etymonline.com. Retrieved on 2011-11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'', which discusses the manufacture of soap from tallow and ashes, but the only use he mentions for it is as a [[pomade]] for hair; he mentions rather disapprovingly that the men of the [[Gaul]]s and [[Teutons|Germans]] were more likely to use it than their female counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/28*.html#191 XXVIII.191].

Francis Adams (London) 1856:[https://books.google.com/books?id=v4gIAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=it#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 238 and 496] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609210236/https://books.google.com/books?id=v4gIAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=it |date=2016-06-09 }}, noted in Michael W. Dols, "Leprosy in medieval Arabic medicine" ''Journal of the History of Medicine'' 1979:316 note 9; the Gauls with whom the Cappadocian would have been familiar are those of Anatolian [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans' preferred method of cleaning the body was to massage oil into the skin and then scrape away both the oil and any dirt with a [[strigil]]. The Gauls used soap made from animal fat.

[[Zosimos of Panopolis]], ''circa'' 300 AD, describes soap and soapmaking.&lt;ref name=Partington /&gt; [[Galen]] describes soap-making using lye and prescribes washing to carry away impurities from the body and clothes. The use of soap for personal cleanliness became increasingly common in the 2nd century A.D. According to Galen, the best soaps were Germanic, and soaps from Gaul were second best.&lt;ref name=Partington&gt;{{cite book|last=Partington|first=James Riddick|author2=Hall, Bert S |title=A History of Greek Fire and Gun Powder|publisher=JHU Press|year=1999|page=307|isbn=0-8018-5954-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Islamic Middle East=====
Hard toilet soap with a pleasant smell was produced in the [[Middle East]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], when soap-making became an established industry. Recipes for soap-making are described by [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] (854–925), who also gave a recipe for producing [[glycerine]] from [[olive oil]]. In the Middle East, soap was produced from the interaction of [[fatty oil]]s and [[fat]]s with [[alkali]]. In [[Syria]], soap was produced using olive oil together with alkali and [[Lime (material)|lime]]. Soap was exported from Syria, to other parts of the [[Muslim world]] and to Europe.&lt;ref name="hassan"&gt;[[Ahmad Y. al-Hassan]] (2001), [https://books.google.com/books?id=h2g1qte4iegC&amp;pg=PA73 ''Science and Technology in Islam: Technology and applied sciences'', pages 73-74] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209061203/https://books.google.com/books?id=h2g1qte4iegC&amp;pg=PA73 |date=2017-12-09 }}, [[UNESCO]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 12th-century Islamic document describes the process of soap production.&lt;ref&gt;BBC ''Science and Islam'' Part 2,  Jim Al-Khalili.  BBC Productions.  Accessed 30 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  It mentions the key ingredient, [[alkali]], which later becomes crucial to modern chemistry, derived from ''al-qaly'' or "ashes".

By the 13th century, the manufacture of soap in the Islamic world had become virtually industrialized, with sources in [[Nablus]], [[Fes]], [[Damascus]], and [[Aleppo]].&lt;ref name=IMEU&gt;{{cite web|title=Nablus' olive oil soap: a Palestinian tradition lives on|author=Phillips, Michael|publisher=[[Institute for Middle East Understanding]] (IMEU)|date=March 11, 2008|accessdate=2008-03-27|url=http://imeu.net/news/article008132.shtml|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720073112/http://imeu.net/news/article008132.shtml|archivedate=July 20, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sunbula&gt;{{cite web|title=Craft Traditions of Palestine|publisher=Sunbula|url=http://www.sunbula.org/crafttrad.shtml|accessdate=2008-04-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080321111836/http://www.sunbula.org/crafttrad.shtml |archivedate = March 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lands of [[Medieval Spain]] were a leading soapmaker by 800, and soapmaking began in the [[Kingdom of England]] about 1200.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soap-flakes.com/history.html www.soap-flakes.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526035507/http://www.soap-flakes.com/history.html |date=2015-05-26 }}. soap-flakes.com. Retrieved on 2015-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Soapmaking is mentioned both as "women's work" and as the produce of "good workmen" alongside other necessities, such as the produce of carpenters, blacksmiths, and bakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Readings in European History: Vol. I |first=James Harvey |last=Robinson |publisher=Ginn and co |year=1904 |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/carol-devillis.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925094733/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/carol-devillis.html |archivedate=2009-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, soap in the 9th century was produced from animal fats and had an unpleasant smell. Hard toilet soap with a pleasant smell was later imported from the Middle East.&lt;ref name="hassan"/&gt;

In France, by the second half of the 15th century, the semi-industrialized professional manufacture of soap was concentrated in a few centers of [[Provence]]—[[Toulon]], [[Hyères]], and [[Marseille]]—which supplied the rest of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nef, John U. |title=A Comparison of Industrial Growth in France and England from 1540 to 1640: III|journal=The Journal of Political Economy|volume=44|issue=5|year=1936|pages=643–666 (660ff.)|jstor=1824135|doi=10.1086/254976}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Marseilles, by 1525, production was concentrated in at least two factories, and soap production at Marseille tended to eclipse the other Provençal centers.&lt;ref&gt;Barthélemy, L. (1883) "La savonnerie marseillaise", noted by Nef 1936:660 note 99.&lt;/ref&gt; English manufacture tended to concentrate in London.&lt;ref&gt;Nef 1936:653, 660.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finer soaps were later produced in Europe from the 16th century, using vegetable oils (such as [[olive oil]]) as opposed to animal fats. Many of these soaps are still produced, both industrially and by small-scale artisans. [[Castile soap]] is a popular example of the vegetable-only soaps derived from the oldest "white soap" of Italy.

Industrially manufactured '''bar soaps''' became available in the late 18th century, as advertising campaigns in Europe and America promoted popular awareness of the relationship between cleanliness and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Encyclopaedia of the History of Technology |first=Ian |last=McNeil |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-415-01306-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxsOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA203 |pages=2003–205 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505145316/https://books.google.com/books?id=uxsOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA203 |archivedate=2016-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, the use of soap has become commonplace in industrialized nations due to a better understanding of the role of [[hygiene]] in reducing the population size of [[pathogenic]] [[microorganisms]]. 

=====20th century=====
Until the [[Industrial Revolution]], soapmaking was conducted on a small scale and the product was rough. In 1780, [[James Keir]] established a chemical works at [[Tipton]], for the manufacture of alkali from the sulfates of [[potash]] and soda, to which he afterwards added a soap manufactory. The method of extraction proceeded on a discovery of Keir's. [[Andrew Pears]] started making a high-quality, transparent soap in 1807&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pears, Francis |title=The Skin, Baths, Bathing, and Soap |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFlJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA100 |year=1859 |publisher=The author |pages=100– |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504074628/https://books.google.com/books?id=yFlJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA100 |archivedate=2016-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[London]]. His son-in-law, [[Thomas J. Barratt]], opened a factory in [[Isleworth]] in 1862.

During the [[Restoration era]] (February 1665 – August 1714) a soap tax was introduced in England, which meant that until the mid-1800s, soap was a luxury, used regularly only by the well-to-do. The soap manufacturing process was closely supervised by revenue officials who made sure that soapmakers' equipment was kept under lock and key when not being supervised. Moreover, soap could not be produced by small makers because of a law which stipulated that soap boilers must manufacture a minimum quantity of one imperial ton at each boiling, which placed the process beyond reach of the average person. The soap trade was boosted and deregulated when the tax was repealed in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Soap Tax|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/27th-april-1833/14/the-soap-tax|website=The Spectator Archive|publisher=The Spectator, London|accessdate=23 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324084455/http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/27th-april-1833/14/the-soap-tax|archivedate=24 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Repeal of the Soap Tax|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1838/apr/03/repeal-of-the-soap-tax|website=Hansard|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=23 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324084015/http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1838/apr/03/repeal-of-the-soap-tax|archivedate=24 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hansard|first1=Thomas Curson|title=Hansard's Parliamentary Debates|date=1864|publisher=Forgotten Books|location=Uxbridge, England|isbn=9780243121328|pages=363–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Gossage]] produced low-priced, good-quality soap from the 1850s. [[Robert Spear Hudson (soap)|Robert Spear Hudson]] began manufacturing a soap powder in 1837, initially by grinding the soap with a [[mortar and pestle]]. American manufacturer [[Benjamin T. Babbitt]] introduced marketing innovations that included sale of bar soap and distribution of [[product sample]]s. [[William Hesketh Lever]] and his brother, James, bought a small soap works in [[Warrington]] in 1886 and founded what is still one of the largest soap businesses, formerly called Lever Brothers and now called [[Unilever]]. These soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale [[advertising]] campaigns.

=====Liquid soap=====
{{See also|Detergent}}

Liquid soap was not invented until the nineteenth century; in 1865, William Shepphard patented a liquid version of soap. In 1898, B.J. Johnson developed a soap derived from palm and olive oils; his company, the [[Colgate-Palmolive#History|B.J. Johnson Soap Company]], introduced "[[Palmolive (soap)|Palmolive]]" brand soap that same year. This new brand of soap became popular rapidly, and to such a degree that B.J. Johnson Soap Company changed its name to [[Colgate-Palmolive|Palmolive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colgate-Palmolive Company History: Creating Bright Smiles for 200 Years|url=http://www.colgate.com/app/Colgate/US/Corp/History/1806.cvsp|publisher=[[Colgate-Palmolive]] Company|accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, other companies began to develop their own liquid soaps. Such products as [[Pine-Sol]] and [[Tide (brand)|Tide]] appeared on the market, making the process of cleaning things other than skin, such as clothing, floors, and bathrooms, much easier.

Liquid soap also works better for more traditional or non-machine washing methods, such as using a [[Washboard (laundry)|washboard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Liquid Soap|url=http://www.blueaspenoriginals.org/liquid-soap.html|publisher=Blue Aspen Originals|accessdate=17 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201140608/http://www.blueaspenoriginals.org/liquid-soap.html|archivedate=1 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Soapmaking|Soap-making}} Soap-making for hobbyists====
A variety of methods are available for hobbyists to make soap.&lt;ref&gt;Garzena, Patrizia, and Tadiello, Marina (2013). ''The Natural Soapmaking Handbook''. [http://www.demetra.com.au/ Online information and Table of Contents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150730033519/http://www.demetra.com.au/ |date=2015-07-30 }}. {{ISBN|978-0-9874995-0-9}}/&lt;/ref&gt; Most soapmakers use processes where the glycerol remains in the product, and the saponification continues for many days after the soap is poured into [[Mold (cooking implement)|mold]]s. The glycerol is left during the hot-process method, but at the high temperature employed, the reaction is practically completed in the kettle, before the soap is poured into molds. This simple and quick process is employed in small factories all over the world.

Handmade soap from the cold process also differs from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the [[alkali]] (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called "superfatting"), and the glycerol left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer. Addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces [[glycerin soap]]. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat, although it can leave a "greasy" feel. Sometimes, an [[Moisturizer|emollient]] is added, such as [[jojoba]] oil or [[shea butter]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}  [[Sand]] or [[pumice]] may be added to produce a [[wiktionary:scouring|scouring]] soap. The scouring agents serve to remove dead cells from the skin surface being cleaned. This process is called [[exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliation]]. 
[[File:Pouring lye into water to make soap.jpg|thumbnail|right|The [[lye]] is dissolved in water.]]

To make [[antibacterial]] soap, compounds such as [[triclosan]] or [[triclocarban]] can be added. There is some concern that use of antibacterial soaps and other products might encourage [[antibiotic resistance]] in microorganisms.&lt;ref name="AntibacterialABC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117985 |title=Antibacterial Soaps Concern Experts |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=12 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112070010/http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=117985 |archivedate=12 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solar Academy International''' is a global [[Solar energy]] training school network. Solar Academy International's first training center, [[Ontario Solar Academy]], was established in 2009 in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada. Entrepreneurs and founders of Solar Academy International, [[Jacob Travis]] and [https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgower David Gower], created the training school in response to demands by [[Solar energy|solar]] companies experiencing a shortage in qualified workers within the solar industry, following the surge in interest in solar energy upon the passing of the Ontario [[Green Energy Act 2009]] that led to the creation of the Feed-in Tariff Program. Today, Solar Academy International is the largest training school in [[Canada]], having trained over 700 student graduates, with operations expanding overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/partner/solar-network-international/news/article/2012/06/solar-internship-programs-in-toronto-canada-begins-june-25-and-july-16 |title=Summer Solar Internship Programs in Toronto, Canada Begin June 25 and July 16 |publisher=RenewableEergyWorld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school's most popular class is a 5-day [[Workshop|intensive course]] in which students are taught the fundamental basics of the solar industry including aspects of design, sales, and installation by [[North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners|NABCEP]]-certified installers. Instructors have, in addition to sharing a wealth of field experience and knowledge in best practices, been known to take on students for solar projects, offering practical, paid experience to beginners looking to enter the solar industry. The course concludes with a field trip to a LEED-certified Platinum facility with an operational solar PV system. This intensive course also satisfies the education requirements laid out by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) for the Entry Level Program. Students who have completed the course are eligible to write the NABCEP Entry Level Exam at one of Castle Worldwide's testing facilities by registering through the Academy.

Solar Academy International also recently started offering a multiple month internship program for interested applicants to get both knowledge and experience into the solar industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/partner/solar-network-international/news/article/2012/06/solar-internship-programs-in-toronto-canada-begins-june-25-and-july-16 |title=Summer Solar Internship Programs in Toronto, Canada Begin June 25 and July 16 |publisher=RenewableEergyWorld.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internship is tailored to the intern's strengths and interests and offers flexibility in length and scope.

==Ontario Solar Academy==
On August 27, 2010, the then-named Ontario Solar Academy was the first solar PV training school in Canada to receive the Institute for Sustainable Power Quality (ISPQ) accreditation by the [[Interstate Renewable Energy Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/canadas-leading-solar-school-receives-international-recognition-solar-panel-1319219.htm |title=Canada's Leading Solar School Receives International Recognition for Solar Panel Installation Training|publisher=MarketWired.com |date= |accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISPQ Accreditation is internationally recognized for having high standards in solar energy education and is awarded to training providers. Enrollment in the course surged upon approval of this accreditation, with many students satisfied with the quality of instruction and comprehensiveness of the introductory course.

==Course Location==
Courses in Canada are held at the Franken Solar facilities in Mississauga, Ontario. Past courses have also been held in select cities in the United States. Workshops in Miami and Toronto are slated to take place in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solaracademyinternational.com |title=Solar Academy International |publisher=solaracademyinternational.com |date= |accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1995, founder [[Tulsi Tanti]] was managing a 20-employee textile company. Due to the erratic availability of power locally, and its rising costs, the highest business expenditure after the raw materials was electricity.&lt;ref name="powerhouses"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[India's Global Powerhouses]] |last=Kumar |first=Nirmalya |authorlink=Nirmalya Kumar |year=2009 |publisher=[[Harvard Business Press]] |isbn=978-1-4221-4762-7 |pages=136–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of electricity also offset any profits made by the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1663317_1663322,00.html Heroes of the Environment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825150950/http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1663317_1663322,00.html |date=25 August 2013 }}, Time, 17 October 2007, accessed on 26 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; After providing electricity for his own company, Tanti moved into wind energy production as a way to secure the textile company's energy needs, and founded Suzlon Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = India's 40 Richest| publisher=Forbes.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727215554/http://www.forbes.com/global/2006/1127/039.html|archivedate=27 July 2012|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2006/1127/039.html |accessdate=14 February 2015|date=17 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suzlon adopted a business model wherein clients would be responsible for 25% of the up-front capital investment and Suzlon would arrange the remaining 75% on loan. Initially, banks were hesitant to fund loans for this model, but by 2008, many Indian banks started financing wind power projects for Suzlon clients.&lt;ref name="powerhouses"/&gt;

In 2001, Tanti sold off the textile business; Suzlon is still actively run by Tulsi Tanti, now in the role of Chairman, Suzlon Group.

In the year 2006, Suzlon reached a definitive agreement for acquisition of Belgium firm Hansen Transmissions, specializing in gearboxes for wind turbines, for $565 million. In 2007, the company purchased a controlling stake in Germany's [[Senvion]] (then operating as REpower Systems) which valued the firm at US$1.6 billion.

In June 2007, Suzlon had signed a contract with Edison Mission Energy (EME) of US for delivery of 150 wind turbines of 2.1 megawatts in 2008 and a similar volume to be delivered in 2009. EME had an option not to purchase the 150 turbines due to be delivered in 2009, which it has chosen to exercise.

In November 2009, the company decided to sell 35% stake of Hansen for $370 million as part of its debt restructuring program, through placing new shares. It appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley as the managers and book runners for the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sharemanthan.in/index.php/component/content/article/61-corporate-update/4482-suzlon-to-sell-35-per-cent-of-hansen |title=सुजलॉन बेचेगी हैनसेन का 35% हिस्सा |publisher=Sharemanthan.in |accessdate=22 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120917140940/http://www.sharemanthan.in/index.php/component/content/article/61-corporate-update/4482-suzlon-to-sell-35-per-cent-of-hansen |archivedate=17 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livemint.com/2010/02/01224856/Suzlon-awaiting-large-orders.html |title=Suzlon: awaiting large orders - Money Matters |publisher=livemint.com |date=2 February 2010 |accessdate=22 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410081226/http://www.livemint.com/2010/02/01224856/Suzlon-awaiting-large-orders.html |archive-date=10 April 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Business Standard |url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/suzlon-some-breeze-finally/10/02/378264/ |title=Suzlon: Some breeze, finally |publisher=Business-standard.com |accessdate=22 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012062741/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/suzlon-some-breeze-finally/10/02/378264/ |archive-date=12 October 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{mergeto|Minimum mass|discuss=Talk:Minimum mass#Proposed merger of True mass|date=January 2018}}
The term '''''true mass''''' is synonymous with the term [[mass]], but is used in [[astronomy]] to differentiate the measured mass of a planet from the [[minimum mass|lower limit of mass]] usually obtained from [[radial velocity]] techniques.&lt;ref name="ut" /&gt; Methods used to determine the true mass of a [[planet]] include measuring the distance and period of one of its [[natural satellite|satellites]],&lt;ref name="Brown Schaller 2007" /&gt; advanced [[astrometry]] techniques that use the motions of other planets in the same [[star system]],&lt;ref name="ut" /&gt; combining radial velocity techniques with [[Astronomical transit|transit]] observations (which indicate very low orbital inclinations),&lt;ref name="cornell" /&gt; and combining radial velocity techniques with [[parallax|stellar parallax]] measurements (which also determine orbital inclinations).&lt;ref name="Han Black Gatewood 2001" /&gt;
