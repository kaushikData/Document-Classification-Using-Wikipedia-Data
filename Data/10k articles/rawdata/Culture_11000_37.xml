'''Gil Alberto Enríquez Gallo''' (24 July 1894 &amp;ndash; 13 July 1962) was [[List of heads of state of Ecuador|President]] of [[Ecuador]] 1937&amp;ndash;1938.

Enriquez was appointed as a general in the Ecuadorian army by [[Federico Páez]], and served as Minister of Defense in his government. In September 1937, he overthrew Páez in a military coup.  Although he ruled for less than a year, Enríquez achieved note as a social reformer by his promulgation of the Labor Code of 1938.

Enríquez is also remembered for having initiated a protracted confrontation with the United States-based South American Development Company over the terms of its Ecuadorian concession and the wages it paid its Ecuadorian employees.  The company refused to comply with Enríquez's entreaty that more of the profits from its mining operations stay in Ecuador, and it won the support of the United States Department of State.

The Ashta-Nayika classification (''nayika-bheda'') first appears in ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' (24.210-11), a key [[Sanskrit]] treatise on Indian [[performing arts]], authored by [[Bharata Muni|Bharata]] (dated between 2nd century BC and 2nd century AD).&lt;ref name="sahitya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="music"&gt;{{cite book|last=Luiz Martinez|first= José |title=Semiosis in Hindustani music|year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidas Publishers|isbn=81-208-1801-6|pages=288–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification is detailed in later works like the ''Dasarupaka'' (10th century), ''[[Sahityadarpana]]'' (14th century) and various other treatises on poetics as well as erotic ''[[Kamashastra]]'' texts like Kuttanimata (8th-9th century) based on courtesans, ''Panchasayaka'', ''Anangaranga'' and ''Smaradipika''. [[Keshavdas|Keshavadasa]]'s ''Rasikapriya'' (16th century) in [[Hindi]], also elaborates on the Ashta-nayika.&lt;ref name="sodhi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sodhi|first=Jiwan|title=A study of Bundi school of painting|year=1999|publisher=Abinav Publishers|isbn=81-7017-347-7|pages=52–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ashta-Nayika have been illustrated in [[Indian painting]], literature, sculpture as well as [[Indian classical dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Banerji|first=Projesh |title=Dance in thumri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsuhSiITjU8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA13&amp;dq=Ashta+Nayika|year=1986|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=81-7017-212-8|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"&gt;{{cite book|last=Varadpande|first=Manohar Laxman |title=Woman in Indian sculpture|year=2006|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=81-7017-474-0|pages=93–106|chapter=Shringara nayika}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable medieval paintings that depict the Ashta nayika are the [[Ragamala paintings]], as those from the [[Bundi]] school of painting.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;

A famous example in Indian literature is [[Jayadeva]]'s ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' (12th century) as well as in the [[Vaishnava]] poet Banamali's compositions, [[Radha]] dons the roles of the various nayikas while with her nayaka is the god [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/09/14/stories/2007091450100200.htm|title=Learn the lingo|date=Sep 14, 2007|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ashta-Nayika is a central theme in ''Pahari embroidery'' used to decorate the ''Chamba [[Rumal]]'', especially produced in [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh|Chamba]], [[Himachal Pradesh]]. The Ashta Nayika are usually portrayed in eight panels on the Rumal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naik|first=Shailaja D. |title=Traditional embroideries of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNAwl-jS3gwC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=%22Ashta+Nayika%22|year=1996|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=81-7024-731-4|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indian (Hindustani) classical music, the eternal love between [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]] is represented through the consciousness of [[Radha]] as the leitmotif that dominates the lyrics. Especially the semi-classical genre of [[Thumri]] imbibes the myriad moods of [[Radha]] as Ashta Nayika consumed by passionate love for [[Krishna]].

==The classification==
The ''Natya Shastra'' describes the nayikas in the following order: Vasakasajja, Virahotkanthita, Svadhinabhartruka, Kalahantarita, Khandita, Vipralabdha, Proshitabhartruka and Abhisarika. The nayikas are further classified in two varieties of the ''[[shringara]] rasa'', the ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' related to love: Sambhoga (love in meeting) and Vipralambha (love in separation). Vasakasajja, Svadhinabhartruka and Abhisarika are associated with  Sambhoga; the others with Vipralambha.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

In the ''Shringara Prakasha'', Bhoja relates the various nayakas and nayikas with musical ''[[raga]]''s and ''ragini''s (a female raga). Somanatha's ''Ragavibodha'' (1609) and Damodara's ''Sangitadarpana'' (c. 1625) continue this trend.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Vasakasajja===

Vasakasajja ("one dressed up for union")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Vasakasajjika is waiting for her lover returning from a long journey. She is depicted in her bed-chamber filled with lotus leaves and garlands.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; She is dressing herself for the union with her lover and "eager with expectation of love's pleasure".&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; Her beauty is compared by Kesavadasa to [[Rati]] - the Hindu love goddess, waiting for her husband, the love god [[Kamadeva]].&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; A Vasakasajja sculpture is found in the Lakshmana Temple in [[Khajuraho]] and the National Museum, Delhi.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

The ''Ragavibodha'' associates the raginis [[Bhupali]] and [[Todi]] with Vasakasajja.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Virahotkanthita===

Virahotkanthita ("One distressed by separation")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Utka (as described by Keshavadasa) is the distressed heroine pining for her lover, who, due to his preoccupation, fails to return home. She is depicted waiting for him, sitting or standing on a bed or out in the pavilion.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;

The ''Ragavibodha'' identifies the raginis Mukhari, Pauravi and Turushkatodi with the Virahotkanthita, while the ''Sangitadarpana'' names Patamanjari in this category.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Svadhinabhartruka===

}}

Svadhinabhartruka ("one having her husband in subjection")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Svadhinapatika(as named by Keshavadasa) is the woman who is loved by her husband and controls him. He is subjugated by her intense love and pleasing qualities.He is devoted and faithful to her
&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; In paintings, this nayika is depicted with a nayaka, who applies ''[[Alta (dye)|mahawar]]'' on her feet or a vermilion [[tilak]] (mark) on her forehead.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; In [[Jayadeva]]'s [[Gita Govinda]] as well as in the poem ''Kuru Yadunandana'', [[Radha]] is portrayed as a Svadhinabhartruka. In the latter, Radha commands her lover, the god [[Krishna]], to rearrange her makeup which is in disarray due to their fierce [[coitus]].&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

Many raginis like Malashri, Travanika, Ramakriti, Jaitashri and Purvi  are associated with Svadhinabhartruka.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Kalahantarita===

Kalahantarita ("one separated by quarrel")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Abhisandhita (as named by Keshavadasa)&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; is a heroine separated from her lover due to a quarrel or jealousy&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; or her own arrogance.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; Her lover is usually depicted leaving her apartment disheartened, while she too becomes heartsick and repentant without him.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; In other portrayals, she is depicted refusing the advances of her lover or refusing a wine cup from him. In Gita Govinda, Radha is also portrayed as Kalahantarita in an instance.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;
{{clear}}

===Khandita===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Khandita Nayika.jpg|thumb|upright|Khandita rebuking her lover.]]

Khandita ("one enraged with her lover")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; is an enraged heroine, whose lover had promised her to spend the night with her, but instead comes to her house the next morning after spending the night with another woman. She is depicted offended, rebuking her lover for his infidelity.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

In the ''Sangitadarpana'', the ragini Varati represents the Khandita Nayika.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Vipralabdha===

Vipralabdha ("one deceived by her lover"),&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; , is a deceived heroine,&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; who waited for her lover the whole night.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; She is depicted throwing away her jewellery as her lover did not keep his promise.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; This happens when a lover meets a Khandita and promises a tryst and breaks his promise.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

The ''Sangitadarpana'' associates Vipralabdha with the ragini Bhupali. However, the ''Ragavibodha'' presents the raginis Varati and Velavati as Vipralabdhas.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Proshitabhartruka===
[[File:Proshita-patika Nayika.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Proshita-patika mourning.]]

She is depicted seated mourning, surrounded by her maids, but refusing to be consoled.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;

The ''Ragavibodha'' describes the raginis Dhanashri and Kamodi as Proshitabhartrukas.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Abhisarika===

Abhisarika ("one who moves")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; is a heroine, who sets aside her modesty and moves out of her home to secretly meet her lover.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; She is depicted at the door of her house and on her way to the tryst, defying all kinds of difficulties like the storm, snakes and dangers of the forest.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; In art, Abhisarika is portrayed often in hurry towards her destination.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

The raginis Bahuli and Saurashtri are described having the traits of the daring Abhisarika.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Viral poetry publishers, including Button Poetry, have received backlash from critics who suggest that the works make "a mockery of the whole canon."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/from-instapoets-to-the-bards-of-youtube-poetry-is-going-viral-and-some-poets-hate-that/2018/05/06/ea4240fa-4329-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html|title=From Instapoets to the bards of YouTube, poetry is going viral.

The '''Canadian Centennial''' was a yearlong celebration held in 1967 when [[Canada]] celebrated the 100th anniversary of the [[Canadian Confederation]]. Celebrations occurred throughout the year but culminated on [[Canada Day|Dominion Day]], July 1, 1967. Coins were different from other years' issues, with animals on each&amp;nbsp;— the [[Canadian cent coin|cent]], for instance, had a [[Rock dove|dove]] on its reverse. Communities and organizations across Canada were encouraged to engage in Centennial projects to celebrate the anniversary. The projects ranged from special one-time events to local improvement projects, such as the construction of municipal arenas and parks. The [[Centennial Flame]] was also added to Parliament Hill.  Children born in 1967 were declared Centennial babies.

==Centennial projects==

Under the Centennial Commission, convened in January 1963, various projects were commissioned to commemorate the Centennial year.{{sfn|The Canadian Encyclopedia}} The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] commissioned [[Gordon Lightfoot]] to write the song the "[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]" for broadcast on January 1, 1967. The [[Government of Canada|Canadian Government]] commissioned typographer Carl Dair to create a new and distinctively Canadian [[typeface]]. The first proof of [[Cartier (typeface)|Cartier]] was published as "the first Canadian type for text composition" to mark the centenary of [[Canadian Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0002105 The Canadian Encyclopedia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716112425/http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0002105 |date=July 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Armed Forces contributed to Centennial celebrations by producing a military tattoo unlike any other in Canadian history.  It was formed in Picton, Ontario in February 1967 by members from the three branches of the military providing service personnel at the Picton base for training purposes.  The "show" was produced by Colonel Ian Fraser of the Black Watch and would eventually included 1700 military men and women in a show that would travel across Canada from March to November performing over 150 performances.  Some said that Tattoo 1967 was the major event that year and there were calls to have the Tattoo travel through the U.S., Europe and even Russia but the Prime Minister at the time scuttled the idea.  The CBC and NFB filmed the Tattoo as did the Military.  Tattoo 1967 was the largest undertaking by the military during peace time and has never been reproduced since.  The Tattoo depicted the military history of Canada from the first French military and settlers in Canada in 1665 right up to Canada's UN Peace Keeping role in 1967.

[[Challenge for Change]] (in Quebec ''Societé Nouvelle'') was a [[Participatory video|participatory film and video project]] created by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] in 1967 as a response to the Centennial. Active until 1980, Challenge for Change used film and video production to illuminate the social concerns of various communities within Canada, with funding from eight different departments of the [[Canadian government]]. The impetus for the program was the belief that film and video were useful tools for initiating social change and eliminating poverty.{{sfn|Schugurensky}}

In Toronto, the [[Caribana]] parade and festival was launched in 1967 as a celebration of Caribbean culture, and as a gift from Canada's West Indian community in tribute to the Centennial year.{{sfn|Gallagher}}{{sfn|Toronto Star|2010}} In November 1967, the ''Confederation of Tomorrow'' conference was held at the newly built [[Toronto-Dominion Centre|Toronto-Dominion Bank Tower]]. Called by [[Premier of Ontario|Ontario Premier]] [[John Robarts]], the summit of provincial premiers led to a new round of federal-provincial negotiations to amend the [[Canadian Constitution]].

The [[Centennial Voyageur Canoe Pageant]] was a canoe race started on May 24 in the Rocky Mountains by ten teams representing eight provinces and the two territories. Two provinces were not entered. 3,283 miles were paddled and [[portage]]d in 104 days by 100 men using six man shifts per team. They arrived in Montreal on September 4. Other privately sponsored canoes from across the country made similar trips.

In addition to these major projects there were commemorative projects throughout the country.  Municipal funding for approved centennial projects was matched dollar for dollar by both the province and the federal government.&lt;ref name=Local&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/1967-centennial-celebrations-emc/ |title=Canada’s Centennial Celebrations, 1967 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Historica Canada |access-date=December 15, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Providing a concrete reminder of the centennial year celebrations these projects included the 1,500 seat [[NorBrock Stadium|Norbrock Stadium]] in [[Kamloops]], [[British Columbia]] to the [[National Arts Centre]] in [[Ottawa]], and many others.&lt;ref name=Local /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kamloops.ca/parks/macisland.shtml#.WFJfMH1841I |title=McArthur Island Park |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=City of Kamloops |access-date=December 15, 2016 |quote=Norbrock was built as a 1967 Canada Centennial project.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately $25 million was made available by the Centennial Committee for local projects.&lt;ref name=Local /&gt;

==Expo 67==
{{main|Expo 67}}
The 1967 International and Universal Exposition, or Expo 67 as it was commonly known, was the general exhibition, [[World's fair#Categories of World Expositions|Category One]] [[World's Fair]] held in [[Montreal]] from April 27 to October 29, 1967. Expo 67 was Canada's main celebration during the centennial year.

In a political and cultural context, Expo 67 was seen as a landmark moment in Canadian history.{{sfn|Ha|2007|p=A3}} Expo 67 in particular was a signifier of the nation's mood of extreme optimism and confidence on heading into its second century. In retrospect, the centennial is seen as a high point of Canadian aspirations prior to the anxious decade of the 1970s that saw the nation divided over issues relating to [[inflation]], an [[recession|economic recession]], government budget deficits and [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatism]]. Popular Canadian historian [[Pierre Berton]] referred to the centennial as "the last good year" in his book ''[[1967: The Last Good Year]]''.

==Confederation train==
In 1961, Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]] proposed a travelling exhibit on a train that would traverse the country and bring exhibits on the history of Canada to the citizens.  The train consisted of six exhibit cars and seven cars for staff and equipment pulled by two diesel locomotives, one from each from [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] and [[Canadian National Railway]].  The locomotives were painted in purple, grey, and black livery and had a custom [[air horn]] that sounded the first four notes of "[[O Canada]]."  The train was inaugurated on January 9, 1967 in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] and made 83 stops across the country before reaching its final stop in Montreal on December 5, 1967.&lt;ref name=holland&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holland|first1=Kevin J|title=Trains of Fame|journal=Canada's History|date=Dec 2017|volume=97|issue=6|pages=20–29|issn=1920-9894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centennial banknote==
The [[Bank of Canada]] issued into [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]] a redesigned version of the $1 [[banknote]] from the [[1954 Series (banknotes)|1954 Series]]. The image on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of this version shows the original [[Parliament Hill|Parliament Buildings]], and the obverse includes a green monochrome adaptation of the stylised maple leaf Centennial logo marked with the years 1867 and 1967.{{sfn|Bank of Canada}} Two variants of the design were printed; the first had the serial number at the top of the obverse, whereas the second and more common variant had the years 1867 and 1967 printed twice flanking the apex of the coat of arms.{{sfn|Bank of Canada}}

==Centennial Medal==
[[Image:Canadian Centennial Medal.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Canadian Centennial Medal (1967)]]

The [[Canadian Centennial Medal]] was issued in 1967 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Confederation of Canada, and was awarded to Canadians who were recommended by governments and associations for having provided valuable service to this country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commemorative Medals|url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=14990&amp;lan=eng|website=The Governor General of Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 30,000 Medals were conferred on Canadians selected from all sectors of Canadian society.

'''''Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics''''' (2004), by Daniel C. Hallin and Paolo Mancini, is a seminal study in the field of international comparative media system research. The study compares media systems of 18 Western [[democracies]] including nine Northern European countries ([[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, [[Sweden]], and [[Switzerland]]), five Southern European countries (France, [[Greece]], Italy, Portugal, and Spain) and four Atlantic countries (Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, and the United States).

The conceptual framework developed in this study turned out to be an important contribution&lt;ref&gt;Quotes for illustration:

„[T]his work, which is being acknowledged as a central text in an emerging subfield.” (Jones, 2008, p. 128)

“Comparing Media Systems is, indeed, a path-breaking volume that will serve as a model for today’s comparative communication analyses.” (Graber, 2006, p. 935)

“What is not open to speculation is the significance of this work. Hallin and Mancini’s pio-neering effort will define comparative media research for years to come.” (Patterson, 2007, p. 331)

“A major recent contribution to the comparative research tradition “ (Hardy, 2008, p. 17)

&lt;/ref&gt; to the field of the comparative media systems research because it provides a systematic and applicable approach to analyze differences and similarities of the relationships between [[media and politics]].

Since the publication of Hallin and Mancini’s book in 2004, there has been a vivid academic discussion ([[#Recent developments (Beyond the Western world)|Recent developments]]), particularly with regards to the adequacy of their suggested framework for understanding variations between different systems around the world, located within different cultural, social, and/or political contexts. As a consequence, a flourishing progression within the field of comparative media system research can be stated.

== Contextualization ==

=== Comparative media system research ===
The field of comparative media system research has a long tradition reaching back to the study ''Four Theories of the Press'' by Siebert, Peterson and Schramm from 1956. This book was the origin of the academic debate on comparing and classifying media systems,&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hardy (2008), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas it was normatively biased&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hardy (2008), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; and strongly influenced by the ideologies of the Cold War era.&lt;ref&gt;Siebert and his colleagues developed a normative classification of four ideal media systems: the libertarian, the social responsible, the Soviet Communist, and the authoritarian model. Consequently, the author’s typology referred to the then ideological segmentation of the world: a liberal democratic free world in the “West” (labeled the [[First World]]), a soviet-communist sphere (labeled the [[Second World]]), and authoritarian states (labeled the [[Third World]]) (cf. Hardy, 2008, p. 11).&lt;/ref&gt; Though this approach has often been criticized&lt;ref&gt;cf. Patterson (2007), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. because of its ethnocentricity, inconsistent structure, questionable typologies, or its scant empirical basis of the analysis&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hardy (2008), p. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;), it was a starting point for following normative media theories&lt;ref&gt;cf. Jackubowicz (2010), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As Hardy (2008) and Jakubowicz (2010) point out, there were additional and modifying developments of the original typologies (e.g. by Denis McQuail (1987), Raymond Williams (1968), or Robert G. Picard (1985)) and alternative schemas as well, which moved further away from the original typologies (e.g. J. Herbert Altschull (1984)).&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of the field.

Comparative media system research has been subject to several changes since its establishment.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Jakubowicz (2010), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of categories to describe media systems grew and approaches got more complex. Another trend is that researchers factor in political systems more intensively to explain and compare media systems. A more fundamental development is the shift from normative to empirically based approaches.

There are still problems of comparative media studies in various countries which must be faced. The validity of the country sampling procedure is one problem, beside the adequate definition of the scope of the comparison to meet the specific national features of the cases, and the definition of adequate indicators as the basis for the comparison.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Sparks (2006), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the developed models are still relatively static not being able to describe changes adequately, and online media have been largely neglected though their importance has been increasing since the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Jakubowicz (2010), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, comparative media system studies are an important instrument for contemporary communication phenomena under study. The comparative design is a bridge between traditional and nation-centered studies of media systems and new media as well as globalization perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hardy (2008), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Jakubowicz points out that contemporarily comparative media system analyses are seen as the key approach to understand globalization processes of the media.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Jakubowicz (2010), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Systematic classification of the approach ===
Comparative media system research is one possible approach to study transnational and border-crossing communication processes worldwide. A very useful and heuristic systematization of the vast field of transnational and border-crossing communication comes from Wessler and Brüggemann (2012)&lt;ref&gt;cf. Wessler &amp; Brüggemann (2012, in press).&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Mediated cross-border communication#Dimensions of analysis|Dimensions of analysis]]). According to this heuristic, the approach from Hallin and Mancini can be identified and localized as one specific combination of the components along these three [[Mediated cross-border communication#Dimensions of analysis|dimensions of analysis]]. Their perspective of analysis is focused on a systematic comparison of media systems within Western democracies. Consequently, their level of analysis concentrates on media systems within the context of nation states. Their main objectives are media-politics relations primarily on the level of structures, but in addition to it, they consider all objects of analysis to gain an encompassing understanding of these relations.

== Objectives ==
Developing a unifying conceptual framework for comparing media systems was essential for Hallin and Mancini. They focused on theory building rather than testing theories, as the then prevailing ''Four Theories of the Press'' and its subsequent normative modifications showed deficiencies in adequately analyzing present media systems. Consequently, Hallin and Mancini focused on an empirical “by treating these systems not as abstract ideals but as concrete social formations that developed under particular historical conditions.”&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012a), p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hallin and Mancini initially chose a “most similar systems”-design – that is, comparing systems which are quite similar according to their structures and functioning to understand in which aspects they differ from each other to discover specific characteristics of each single system. Following this design, they conceptualized dimensions containing particular variables to analyze similarities and differences between the 18 countries under study. Their objective was to find more or less coherent patterns within their sample which could possibly be condensed into [[ideal type]]s in terms of [[Max Weber]]’s conception of ideal types. Since the dimensions and the resulting models cover specifically the media-politics relations of the Western world, Hallin and Mancini do not claim universal [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of their framework. Hence, it must be reconceptualized to meet the specific conditions of media-politics relations beyond the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hallin and Mancini’s framework ==
Hallin and Mancini’s conceptual framework&lt;ref&gt;The dimensions that Hallin and Mancini use for their framework are originally not devised by them. They trace to then existing concepts (e.g. the dimension of [[political parallelism]] is initially developed by Seymour-Ure (1974)) but they “go beyond earlier scholars in amplifying these dimensions and exploring their linkages” (Patterson, 2007, p. 329).&lt;/ref&gt; consists of the [[#Dimensions: media systems|four dimensions]] ''structure of media markets'', ''[[political parallelism]]'', ''[[professionalization]] of [[journalism]]'', and the ''role of the state'' with regards to media systems; and of the [[#Dimensions: political context|five dimensions]] the ''role of the state'', ''type of democracy'' (consensus vs. majoritarian), ''type of pluralism'' (individual vs. organized), ''degree of rational-legal authority'', and ''degree of pluralism'' (moderate vs. polarized) with reference to the political contexts of media systems. According to specific constellations of the variables within these dimensions, Hallin and Mancini conceptualized [[#The three models of media and politics|the three models of media and politics]].

=== Dimensions: media systems ===

==== Structure of media markets&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 22-26.&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The structure of media markets is concerned with the development of a [[mass media|mass press]]. The authors highlight several variables which can be used to describe the characteristics of [[newspaper|press systems]]: 
* [[newspaper circulation]] rates
* newspaper-readership relationship (elite- vs. mass-orientation)
* gender differences in newspaper reach
* relative importance of [[newspapers]] and [[television]] as sources of [[news]]
* ratio of local, regional, and national newspapers
* degree of a clear separation between [[sensationalism|sensationalist]] mass press and [[quality press]]
* regional or linguistic segmentation of media markets
* influence of bordering countries on the national media system

==== Political parallelism&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 26-33.&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[Political parallelism]] refers to the “fact that media in some countries have distinct political orientations, while media in other countries do not.”&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors established 5 factors or indicators to assess the extent of [[political parallelism]]:
* the extent of political orientation within media content
* organizational connections between the media and political organizations
* the tendency of media personnel to take part in political life
* [[partisanship]] of media audiences
* [[Journalism|journalists’]] role orientation and practices (e.g. journalists as advocates vs. neutral arbiters, opinion-oriented vs. information-oriented reporting style, separating vs. blending commentary and information)
* internal pluralism (i.e. covering different opinions and perspectives within one medium) or external pluralism (i.e. covering different opinions and perspectives within one media branch (e.g. the [[newspaper|press system]]))
* the regulation of [[public service broadcasting]] (e.g. controlled by the government, insulated from direct political control, proportional representation of political parties or socially relevant groups)

==== Professionalization of journalism&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 33-41.&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The [[professionalization]] refers to the continuum of independent to instrumentalized journalism:
* degree of [[autonomy]]
* development of distinct professional norms and rules (e.g. practical routines or ethical principles)
* public service orientation of the journalists (i.e. orientation towards an ethic of public service rather than towards interests of individual persons)

==== Role of the state&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 41-44.&lt;/ref&gt; ====
This dimension stresses the power the political system has in shaping the structure and functioning of a media system. “But there are considerable differences in the extent of state [[interventionism (politics)|intervention]] as well as in the forms it takes.”&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Hallin and Mancini use the following variables to cover this fourth dimension:
* [[censorship]] or other types of political pressure
* endowment of the media with economic [[subsidies]]
* ownership of media- or telecommunication-organizations
* provision of regulations for the media ([[laws]], [[licensing]], etc.)
* the state as an information source and “primary definer” of news

Ultimately, the interrelations of these four dimensions are complex. They have to be assessed empirically for every new case under study. Consequently, they may “influence one another in important ways, but also vary independently.”&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dimensions: political context ===
In a next step, Hallin and Mancini identified five core dimensions to assess the political contexts of media systems. They took relevant concepts from the literatures on [[comparative politics]] and [[political sociology]] to gain a better understanding of the political influences on the development of media systems. The resulting dimensions are presented as [[dichotomies]], but they are just poles on a continuum.

The first dimension is the '''''role of the state'''''.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; It is conceptualized by the distinction between ''[[liberal democracies]]'' and ''[[welfare state]] democracies''. The main difference between these two categories is the [[Economic interventionism|interventional]] activity of the state (e.g. [[funding]] vs. [[free market]]). This difference takes shape in the relative importance of [[private business]] or [[social institutions]] within the [[political system]] in question.

A further important dichotomic dimension is labeled '''''consensus vs. majoritarian democracy'''''.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 50-53.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Majoritarianism|Majoritarian]] democratic systems contain two dominating [[parties]] and, due to the [[plurality voting system]], the winning party actually concentrates the political power so that there is a clear distinction between the [[government]] and the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]]. Furthermore, the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] predominantly influences political decision processes. By contrast, the [[Consensus decision-making|consensus politics]] model encompasses a [[multi-party system]] which is based on the power sharing principle according to the proportional representation so that [[compromise]] and [[cooperation]] between the opposing forces are central. Additionally, there is a separation of power between [[legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]].

The third dimension is the distinction between '''''individual and organized pluralism'''''&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 53-55.&lt;/ref&gt; resp. '''''[[liberalism]]''''' and '''''[[corporatism]]'''''. Individual pluralism is defined as the organization of the political representation “in terms of the relation between governing institutions and individual citizens, along with a multiplicity of competing ‘special interests’”.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the focus on organized social groups is more important within organized pluralism systems. Thus, corporatism includes the “formal integration of social groups into the political process”.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hallin and Mancini identify the distinction between '''''[[rational-legal authority]] and [[clientelism]]'''''&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 55-59.&lt;/ref&gt; as another crucial dimension. Following [[Max Weber]], Hallin and Mancini use the term [[rational-legal authority]] in its meaning as a form of governance whose main influence is maintained through formal and universalistic rules of procedure, i.e. an independent and autonomous administrative apparatus not affected by political and economic interests or [[lobbyism]]. This apparatus is the main institution of an efficient rational-legal system. In contrast, the orientation on common interests is much weaker within [[clientelism]] systems because individual interests and private relationships are the main forces maintaining the social organization. Consequently, “access to social resources is controlled by patrons and delivered to clients in exchange for deference and various forms of support”.&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final dimension is conceptualized by the distinction between '''''moderate and polarized pluralism'''''.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Low [[consensus]], challenged [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the [[political organizations]] or [[political system|system]], and deep cleavages within the political landscape are the main characteristics of polarized pluralism. An important indicator is the existence of anti-system parties and factions. Compared to this, moderate pluralism is mainly characterized by stronger tendencies toward the center, lower ideological differences between the [[political parties]], greater acceptance of the [[political system]], and better chances to gain [[consensus]] during political controversies.

=== The three models of media and politics ===
By using the aforementioned dimensions, Hallin and Mancini deduced and conceptualized three [[ideal type|ideal models]] of media-politics relations (‘ideal’ according to [[Max Weber]]). Hallin and Mancini could identify specific patterns by geographical regions which were crucial for labeling the individual models:

Controlled deregulation refers to the establishment of media policies by the political system, e.g. the implementation of formal licensing procedures for commercial broadcasting. Savage deregulation relates to the failure of the political system to impose such media policies. Consequently, the media corporations defined the regulation of the broadcasting market. Additionally, Traquina (1995) points out that the competition among broadcasters ends in a mainstream orientation and less diversity concerning media contents.&lt;/ref&gt; (except France) || strong state intervention but with protection for press freedom; press subsidies, particularly strong in Scandinavia; strong public-service broadcasting || market dominated (except strong public broadcasting in Britain and Ireland)

=== Restrictions ===
Hallin and Mancini point to restrictions&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 66-73.&lt;/ref&gt; of their three models which have to be considered in order not to overvalue the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] and [[Importance|significance]] of them. First of all, they focus on [[nation states]] and this [[level of analysis]] allows a specific perspective on media-politics relations but misses other phenomena of importance (e.g. transnational developments of media markets in Europe). Another concern is that the cases summarized within the single models vary enormously (especially within the Liberal model). Consequently, the models show a wide range of cases which might blur their distinction. Furthermore, the media systems within the analyzed countries might not be [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]] (e.g. the structural differences between the print system and the broadcasting system in Germany). Because of the differences within the countries and the interferences between them, it is difficult to treat the 18 countries analyzed, as single cases because they depend on each other and influence each other. A final point is the dynamic of media systems because they cannot be assumed as static entities. Hence, media systems will always progress and there will always be changes resulting from those developing processes, so that reconsidering the characteristics of the mentioned models becomes necessary over time.
Consequently, Hallin and Mancini point out in subsequent discussions that their models are not intended to be universal typologies which can be applied to other cases mechanically.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2010), p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012a), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they suggest rather focusing on the dimensions and their applicability and adaption to analyze other media systems adequately – e.g. regarding [[Eastern European]] media systems, they propose to attach more weight to the [[#Role of the state|role of the state]] and especially to the role of [[civil society]] to understand these systems appropriately.

=== The convergence-thesis ===
At the end of their book,&lt;ref&gt;Hallin &amp; Mancini (2004), p. 251-295.&lt;/ref&gt; Hallin and Mancini discuss the convergence- or homogenization-thesis. The basis for their argument is their observation of several [[Transformation processes (media systems)|transformation processes]] that take place especially in Europe. The most important processes are the [[European integration]], politically as well as with regards to the media (e.g. [[Institute for Information, Telecommunication and Media Law|European media laws]]), the decline of traditional political mass [[parties]], the American influence on the [[professionalization]] of [[journalism]], and finally the [[commercialization]] of the media markets in Europe. These are the main reasons why Hallin and Mancini conclude, that the European countries might be pushed toward the ''Liberal model''. They even go one step further and hypothesize that the core forces of that homogenization- or convergence-process might be valid for other parts of the world. However, they point out that there might be limitations to this process as well because the elements of the process are anchored in the structural differences between the [[political systems]] around the world.

== Recent developments (Beyond the Western world) ==
In this section, some recent issues and topics are mentioned because they arose from an ongoing scholar discussion about the applicability of Hallin and Mancini’s framework to other, especially non-Western countries:
* Some researchers reflect upon the nature of the Polarized Pluralist model and its alleged applicability for many media systems beyond the Western world, for it seems to be a catch-all residual model.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of argumentation in: Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A related issue is the question whether the Polarized Pluralist model involves negative normative implications (compared to the other two models) what would turn it into an inferior or less-well developed model.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of argumentation in: Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 279-284.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many researchers challenge the convergence-thesis because they identify serious differences between the cases they study and those Hallin and Mancini focused on, so that they conclude that globalization will rather result in hybridization- than in convergence-processes.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of argumentation in: Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 284-287.&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning Western media systems, Hardy for example notes to include matters of ownership concentration and cultural processes to clarify and meet the complexity of convergence-processes.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hardy (2008), p. 231-232.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A related point is the total exclusion of influential new online technologies and media which are of central importance for understanding transformations of media systems as well as the communication patterns within, between and beyond them.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Jackubowicz (2010), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Hardy criticizes the neglect of all forms of entertainment media.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hardy (2008), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the main debates is about the extent to which the variables Hallin and Mancini use to measure the dimensions must be adapted to non-Western cases to meet their particular conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of argumentation in: Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 287-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Others criticize Hallin and Mancini’s concentration on media-politics relations because this perspective neglects interrelated variables, e.g. economic or cultural contexts.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Jackubowicz (2010), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Concerning transnational and global developments, relations and influences around the world, some researches ask the question whether the nation state as a level of analysis is still appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of argumentation in: Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jakubowicz argues that this ''methodological nationalism'' (cf. Mihelj et al., 2008) is inappropriate, for “media systems are no longer exclusively related to single political systems”,&lt;ref&gt;Jackubowicz (2010), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Hardy notes that “[t]he political, legislative, cultural and social dimensions of the state are not simply diminished by globalisation”&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2008), p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; and that “communication systems remain, to a significant degree, national in organization and orientation.”&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2008), p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A related debate is about the adequacy of focusing on structures and systems, as Hallin and Mancini did it, rather than considering more dynamic agencies and processes which cannot be covered entirely by a system-approach.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of argumentation in: Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 301-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. Jackubowicz (2010), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hallin and Mancini decided to use a model- or ideal types-approach to explain certain patterns of their cases. Other researchers remark on the risk of generalizing and abstracting too early within the research process.&lt;ref&gt;Summary of argumentation in: Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012b), p. 300-301.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This vivid discussion reflects the status of Hallin and Mancini’s approach, as it is currently “the most well-developed analytical framework so far for understanding the relationship between media and political systems.”&lt;ref&gt;Hardy (2008), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, there are many studies that apply and adapt the framework for their cases under study.

For example, Dobek-Ostrowska and colleagues published the edited volume ''Comparative Media Systems. European and Global Perspectiv''e (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Dobek-Ostrowska, B., Glowacki, M., Jakubowicz, K., &amp; Sükösd, M. (2010). ''Comparative Media Systems. European and Global Perspective''. Budapest: CEU Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which contains comparative studies referring to or applying Hallin and Mancini’s framework for Central and [[Eastern Europe]] media systems. Hallin and Mancini published the edited volume ''Comparing Media Systems Beyond the Western World'' (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Hallin, D. C., &amp; Mancini, P. (2012). ''Comparing Media Systems Beyond the Western World''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which gives a comprehensive overview with a more global perspective. Case studies from the media systems of [[Israel]], Poland, [[Baltic states]], [[Brazil]], South Africa, Russia, China, and the [[Arab world]] are discussed by the contributors and a methodological reflection of Hallin and Mancini’s framework with regards to non-Western media systems is added.

Further research was conducted by Jonathan Hardy, who analyzed the implications of [[Transformation processes (media systems)|transformation processes]] shaping contemporary media systems. As Hallin and Mancini did, Hardy focuses on media systems within Western democracies (actually 18 countries) and he adjoins their convergence thesis while he concentrates on [[printing|print]] and [[broadcasting]] (especially [[TV]]).&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hardy (2008), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; He chooses four [[paradigms]] (namely the [[liberal democratic]] theory, [[neoliberalism]], [[libertarianism]], and the critical [[political economy]]) as an analytical framework to examine relationships between [[media (communication)|media]] and [[politics]], media and [[policy]], [[media ownership]] and [[transnationalism|transnationalisation]] processes.

Furthermore, Roger Blum’s approach (2005) is an attempt to broaden and complete Hallin and Mancini’s models by adding and modifying dimensions (he developed nine instead of four dimensions), classifying them as liberal, regulated, or as in between these two poles. Blum identifies six models of media systems,&lt;ref&gt;For a summary, cf. Jakubowicz (2010), p. 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt; but he does “not explain how he created the models and why no other combination of specification is necessary”,&lt;ref&gt;Jakubowicz (2010), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; so Blum’s framework is still in need for empirical support.

Other studies focus on a single aspect of Hallin and Mancini’s framework and analyze it in detail. For example, Curran and his colleagues (2009) study the implications of the movement towards rather market-driven media and compare [[news|news contents]] and public knowledge of public affairs within different media systems by testing the [[hypothesis]], “that market-based systems (…) impede the exercise of informed [[citizenship]].”&lt;ref&gt;Curran et al. (2009), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There were also several conferences “triggered” by Hallin and Mancini’s framework; for example the ''International Media and Communication Conference “Comparing Media Systems: West Meets East”'' organized by the Department of Communication and Journalism at the [[University of Wroclaw]] (April 23–25, 2007), where more than 100 researchers attained&lt;ref&gt;cf. Dobek-Ostrowska et al. (2010), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; or conferences initiated by Hallin and Mancini themselves in [[Perugia]] in 2007, and in [[San Diego]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Hallin &amp; Mancini (2012a), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative media system research is an encouraging and important subfield of [[mediated cross-border communication]]. And Hallin and Mancini’s framework has been contributing to its consolidation and progression.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Patterson (2007), p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical management studies''' ('''CMS''') is a loose but extensive grouping of theoretically informed critiques of [[management]], business and organisation, grounded originally in a [[critical theory]] perspective. Today it encompasses a wide range of perspectives that are critical of traditional theories of management and the business schools that generate these theories.

==History==

It is generally accepted that CMS began with [[Mats Alvesson]] and [[Hugh Willmott]]'s edited collection ''Critical Management Studies'' ([[#AlvessonWillmott1992|1992]]). Critical Management Studies (CMS) initially brought together [[critical theory]] and [[post-structuralist]] writings, but has since developed in more diverse directions.

A dominant narrative within CMS is that perhaps the most important development in its stimulation was the global expansion of business schools, an American invention, especially in Europe. Decreases in state funding, so the narrative has it, for social sciences and increases in funding for business schools during the 1980s resulted in many academics with graduate training in [[sociology]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and other social sciences ending up with jobs "training managers".

These academics brought different theoretical tools and political perspectives into business schools. They began to question the politics of [[managerialism]] and to link the techniques of management to neo-liberalism. These new voices drew on the [[Frankfurt School]] of critical theory, and the work of [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]]. Later [[Feminism]], [[queer theory]], [[post-colonial theory]], [[anarchism]], ecological philosophies, and radical democratic theory also had some influence. (See [[#AlvessonWillmott2003|Alvesson and Willmott 2003]] for a survey of the field.)

The roots of CMS also came from a series of UK Labour Process Conferences that began in 1983 and reflected the impact of [[Harry Braverman|Braverman]]'s ([[#Braverman1974|1974]]) attempt to make [[Marxist]] categories central to understanding work organisations. Industrial relations and labor studies scholars have joined the CMS fold in the US, seeking new opportunities for employment as labor-related programs have diminished in number.

At the same time a significant strand of critical accounting studies began to develop marked by the publication of Tony Tinker's ''Paper Prophets'' (1985) and the appearance of the journal ''Critical Perspectives on Accounting''.

Contrasting with the dominant origin narrative is an account which states that, along with the contributors to CMS from the intellectual traditions identified here, there is a significant - and overlapping - bloc among CMS scholars of those who have had extensive pre-University experience as workers and managers. The inconsistencies between their experiences in the workplace and the claims of mainstream managerialism, and an intention to connect those experiences to broader explanations and theorizing leads these people to CMS.

==Geographical base==

The main home of CMS has been in the [[Organizational studies|organisation theory]] and behaviour parts of British, Australian and Scandinavian business schools,&lt;ref&gt;Engwall, L. 2004. The Americanization of Nordic management education. Journal of Management Inquiry, 13: 109–117.&lt;/ref&gt; though there are strong contributions in related fields such as [[sociology]], [[sociology of education]], and [[critical pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;Perriton, L. &amp; Reynolds, M. 2004: Critical Management Education From Pedagogy of Possibility to Pedagogy of Refusal? Management Learning 35, 61-77&lt;/ref&gt; Further, contributions stem from [[accounting]] with growing interest in other management specialisms, such as [[marketing]], international business, [[operational research]], [[logistics]] etc. Since the 1990s academics from North America and other parts of the world are also engaging with this body of writing and research. The CMS Division within the (American) Academy of Management (AoM), with a membership of around 800, is larger and more international than some of its other divisions.

Many heterodox scholars in various parts of the world had been inspired by the international activities of the Standing Conference on Organisational Symbolism. This latter grouping developed work which drew variously on [[post-structuralism]] and [[symbolic interactionism]] in order to develop a cultural and [[anthropology|anthropological]] understanding of contemporary organizations. Others, though, were without affiliation and/or seeking new formations and alliances. Since 1999, there has been a bi-annual CMS conference held in the UK as well as workshops and a bi-annual conference held at US Academy of Management.

Today there are significant concentrations of CMS scholars in the UK at the School of Business and Management at Queen Mary, [[University of London]], at the School of Management at the [[University of Leicester]], the Essex Business School at the [[University of Essex]], Alliance [[Manchester Business School]] at the [[University of Manchester]], and the Marketing Research Group at [[Royal Holloway]].  Elsewhere, [[Copenhagen Business School]], [[Lund School of Economics and Management]] at [[Lund University]] and [[Istanbul Bilgi University]] have clusters of CMS scholars, but many CMS scholars globally rely on conferences and journals like ''Tamara Journal for Critical Organization Studies'', ''ephemera: theory and politics in organization'', ''Culture and Organization'', or ''Organization: the critical journal of organization, theory and society'' for their affiliations.

==Controversy and debate==

Major points of debate have focused on the relationship with more orthodox forms of [[Marxism]], the nature and purposes of CMS critique, as well as on questions of inclusion and exclusion ([[#FournierGrey2000|Fournier and Grey 2000]]), the possibilities of social transformation from within business schools ([[#Parker2002|Parker 2002]]), and the development of alternative models of globalisation.

One trend in CMS has seen the incorporation of [[autonomist]] Marxist theory, first introduced in the English-speaking world by the work of [[Michael Hardt]] and [[Antonio Negri]] (2000).  New CMS scholars using these theories have interests in proposing alternative non-capitalist forms of organizing work and [[personal life|life]] - often around the notion of [[collective responsibility]] for the [[commons]].  Other developments include engagements with [[post-colonial theory]] and [[critical race theory]] to investigate the way management and business schools contribute to what [[Cedric Robinson]] (1983) has called "racial capitalism". Recent critical works have referred to [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]]sian theory (structuralist [[constructivism (disambiguation)|constructivism]])&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P., &amp; Passeron, J. C. 1977. Reproduction in education, society and culture. London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. 2005. The social structures of the economy. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; to point to the risks of elitism&lt;ref&gt;Vaara, E., &amp; Faÿ, E. 2011. How can a Bourdieusian perspective aid analysis of MBA education? Academy of Management Learning and Education, 10: 27–39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaara, E., &amp; Faÿ, E. 2012. Reproduction and change on the global scale: A Bourdieusian perspective on management education. Journal of Management Studies, 49: 1023–1051.&lt;/ref&gt; and social inequality,&lt;ref&gt;Lueg, K., &amp; Lueg, R. 2015. Why do students choose English as a medium of instruction? A Bourdieusian perspective on the study strategies of non-native English speakers. Academy of Management Learning and Education, 14: 5-30.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in management education. Michael Loughlin of Manchester  Metropolitan University has discussed aspects of management theory as "[[pseudo-science]]".&lt;ref&gt;
For example: {{cite book
| last1 = Loughlin
| first1 = Michael
| chapter = 4. The pseudo-science of management
| title = Ethics, management, and mythology: Rational decision making for health service professionals 
| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_o5k8fnmIFgC
| series = Radcliffe Series
| location = Abingdon
| publisher = Radcliffe Medical Press
| publication-date = 2002
| pages = 77–91
| isbn = 9781857755749
| access-date = 2016-04-19
| quote = In addition to the claim that 'quality' is somehow foundational to evaluation, such that to improve a service means to increase or improve its quality, we have seen that a key claim of management theory is that there are 'basic organisational criteria' common to all complex organisations (Berwick 1993, IHSM 1993, Laffel and Blumenthal 1993, Peters 1992). The existence of these common organisational criteria provides the basis for the claim that management is a science, a specific discipline with its own distinctive methods and principles, such that theories developed for the manufacturing sector [...] can meaningfully be applied to the project of improving such radically different practices as healthcare and education. [...] Books like ''The Textbook of Total Quality'' have as much claim to the title of a work of 'science' as ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]''.
| year = 2002
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Wider impatience with market-managerial forms of organization occur commonly enough outside the business school, from [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] protest to popular-media presentations of managers. CMS attempts to articulate these voices within the [[business school]], and to provide ways of thinking beyond current dominant theories and practices of organizations.

[[Marcus Tullius Cicero|Cicero]]'s '''''De fato''''' (Latin, "Concerning [[Fate]]") is a partially [[lost work|lost]] philosophical treatise written in 44 BC. Only two-thirds of the work exists; the beginning and ending are missing.&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preface, iv&lt;/ref&gt; It takes the form of a [[dialogue]], although it reads more like an exposition,&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, 5&lt;/ref&gt;  whose [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]] are Cicero and his friend [[Aulus Hirtius]].

In the work, Cicero analyzes the concept of [[Fate]], and suggests that [[free will]] is a condition of Fate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero, Marcus Tullius]]. Trans.  [[Charles Duke Yonge|C.D. Yonge]] [https://archive.org/details/treatisesofcicer00ciceuoft ''The treatises of M.T. Cicero: On the nature of the gods; On divination; On fate; On the republic; On the laws; and On standing for the consulship.'' pg. 264. London G. Bell, 1878. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De fato''. I.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero, however, does not consciously deal with the distinction between [[fatalism]] and [[determinism]].&lt;ref name='Henry'&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/282901 Henry, Margaret Y. ''Cicero's Treatment of the Free Will Problem.'' Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association, 58 pp. 32-42. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1927. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that ''De Fato'' is an appendix to the treatise on theology formed by the three books of ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' and the two books of ''[[De Divinatione]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero.

==History==
''De fato'' is part of the second group of Cicero's writings.&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, 3&lt;/ref&gt; The work was composed at Pozzuoli between April 17th and May 23rd of 44 BC.&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, 5&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, the work would have most likely been completed prior to Cicero's abortive departure for Greece in July of that year.&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Introduction, 5&lt;/ref&gt; The work was written in haste, as Cicero was planning to return to the political arena.&lt;ref name='Sharples'&gt;R. W. Sharples. ''Cicero: On Fate (De fato) &amp; Boethius: The Consolation of Philosophy IV.5-7, V (Philosophiae Consolationis). Aris &amp; Phillips Ltd, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preface, iv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argumentation==
Hirtius notes that Cicero has adopted the [[Platonic Academy|Academic method]] of investigation: arguing against all propositions.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De fato.'' II.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he outlines the positions of [[Democritus]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Empedocles]], and [[Aristotle]] as those who maintained that everything happens by necessity. As such Cicero develops the propositions of [[Hard determinism|fate and necessity]] as follows:

{{quote|"If all things happen by fate, all things happen with an antecedent cause; and if this is true of desire, it is true also of what follows desire, and therefore true of assent. But if the cause of desire is not within us, desire itself is not in our power; and if this is so, then those things which are brought about by desire are not within us. Therefore neither assent nor action is in our power; and  from this it follows that neither praise nor blame are just, nor honours nor punishment"&lt;ref name='Huby'&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4181841 Huby, Pamela M. ''An Epicurean Argument in Cicero, "De Fato" XVII-40.''Phronesis 15.1, pp. 83-85. BRILL, 1970. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cicero essentially dismisses this proposition as [[reductio ad absurdum|antithetical]] to what is observed, but postulates freedom as a necessity for moral life.&lt;ref name='Henry'/&gt; Ultimately, Cicero maintains this position as he is emotionally convinced that it is in man's power to achieve virtue for himself; if determinism were the order of things, then such ability would not be true.&lt;ref name='Henry'/&gt;

"'''Djibouti'''" ({{lang-so|Jabuuti}}, {{lang-aa|Gabuuti}}) is the [[national anthem]] of the [[Djibouti|Republic of Djibouti]].&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/dj.html|title=Africa: Djibouti|website=CIA|access-date=October 14, 2016|date=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Djibouti national anthem was adopted upon independence from [[France]] in 1977. The words are in [[Somali language|Somali]], and were written by [[Aden Elmi]]. The melody was composed by [[Abdi Robleh]].&lt;ref name="cia" /&gt;

The anthem was first officially played at an independence ceremony on June 27, 1977.&lt;ref name="daily"&gt;{{Cite news |title=NCNA Reports on Djibouti Independence Ceremony |date=27 June 1977 |publisher=U.S. Foreign Broadcast Information Service |location=Djibouti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical references===
Thematically, Elmi's lyrics reference the country's flag as it relates to Djibouti's struggle for independence. The French had staked claim to the region known as [[French Somaliland]] in the mid-1800s. For the next century, the region was overseen by a series of [[List of governors of French Somaliland|French governors]]. The area served as a backdrop for French battles with various opponents including [[Russia]] and [[Italy]].

In 1958, a [[French Somaliland overseas territory referendum, 1958|referendum]] was held in Djibouti to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France,&lt;ref name=Barrington2006&gt;Barrington, Lowell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pyWpKKlukLcC&amp;pg=PA115 ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States''], (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p. 115 {{ISBN|0472068989}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there were reports of [[vote rigging]], with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Shillington, Encyclopedia of African history, (CRC Press: 2005), p. 360 {{ISBN|1579582451}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1960, an official visit to the territory by then French President, General [[Charles de Gaulle]], was also met with demonstrations and rioting.&lt;ref name="Apcoatf"&gt;''A Political Chronology of Africa'', (Taylor &amp; Francis), p.132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nwvol"&gt;''Newsweek'', Volume 81, (Newsweek: 1973), p.254.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On 19 March 1967, a [[French Somaliland independence referendum, 1967|second plebiscite]] was held. Similar to the 1959 referendum, voting was also divided along ethnic lines, with the resident [[Somali people|Somalis]] generally voting for independence, with the goal of eventual reunion with [[Somalia]], and the [[Afar people|Afars]] largely opting to remain associated with France.&lt;ref name="Apcoatf"/&gt; There were again reports of vote rigging on the part of the French authorities.&lt;ref name="Aufsnas"&gt;American Universities Field Staff, ''Northeast Africa series'', Volume 15, Issue 1, (American Universities Field Staff.: 1968), p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;Announcement of the results sparked civil unrest, including several deaths. France also increased its military force along the frontier.&lt;ref name="Nwjestr"&gt;[[Jean Strouse]], ''Newsweek'', Volume 69, Issues 10-17, (Newsweek: 1967), p.48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tioipeami"&gt;Alvin J. Cottrell, Robert Michael Burrell, Georgetown University. Center for Strategic and International Studies, ''The Indian Ocean: its political, economic, and military importance'', (Praeger: 1972), p.166.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the territory was renamed [[French Territory of the Afars and Issas]], but a growing Somali and Afar population united led to a [[Afars and Issas independence referendum, 1977|vote for independence]] in 1977, officially marking [[Djibouti]]'s independence.&lt;ref name="Nwvol"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/dj.html Elections in Djibouti] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The melody by Abdi Robleh is written in [[Time signature|common 4/4 time]]. It consists of twenty [[Bar (music)|measures]].&lt;ref name="sheetmusic"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nationalanthems.info/dj~.jpg |title=Anthem of the Republic of Djibouti |last=Robleh |first=Abdi |last2=Elmi |first2=Aden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Eton College Wall Game.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|Eton College Wall Game]]
The '''Eton wall game''' is a game which bears some resemblance to [[rugby union]] that originated at and is still played at [[Eton College]]. It is played on a strip of ground 5 metres wide and 110 metres long ("The Furrow") next to a slightly curved brick wall ("The Wall") erected in 1717.

The traditional and most important match of the year is played on [[St Andrew's Day]], as the Collegers ([[King's Scholar]]s) take on the [[Oppidans]] (the rest of the school). Although College has only 70 boys to pick from, compared to the 1250 or so Oppidans, the Collegers have one distinct advantage: access to the field on which the Wall Game is played is controlled by a Colleger. Despite this, it is usual for them to allow the Oppidans to use it whenever they wish.


At the annual St Andrew's Day match, the Oppidans climb over the wall, after throwing their caps over in defiance of the Scholars, while the Collegers march down from the far end of College Field, arm-in-arm, towards the near end, where they meet the Oppidans.

The Wall Game is also played on [[Ascension Day]], immediately after a 6 a.m. service on the roof of College Chapel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishpathe.com/video/st-andrews-day-eton-wall-game/query/41+39 British Pathe film on the Eton wall game]&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[scratch match]]es are also played throughout the Michaelmas and [[Lent]] halves (terms), where boys from different year groups, as well as masters, take part.

==Scoring==
The aim of the game is to move the ball towards the opponents' end of the playing area. In those last few yards of the field is an area called the "calx". In this area a player can earn a "shy" (worth one point) by lifting the ball against the wall with his foot. A teammate then touches the ball with his hand and shouts "Got it!" These two plays must happen within the calx. After this, if the umpire says "Given", the scoring team can attempt a goal (worth a further nine points) by throwing the ball at a designated target (a garden door at one end of the field and a tree at the other end). A player can also score a kicked goal, worth five points, if he kicks the ball out and it hits a goal during the normal course of play.

==Play==
[[Image:wallgame.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|First ever inter-school Eton Wall Game in progress]]
The main game consists of the two sets of players forming a rugby-style scrummage (called a "Bully") in which neither team may "furk" the ball, which is to hook it backwards (except in Calx, where a different type of Bully called a Calx Bully occurs). The Bully is formed next to the Wall and crabs slowly along the Wall until the ball emerges. Many players, particularly those whose position is actually against the Wall, lose the skin off their elbows, hips and knees. Because of this, players usually wear long sleeves. Players within the Bully shove and push each other, mostly with their bodies but also by placing their fists against the faces of the opposition and attempting to lever them backwards and away from the Wall. Actual punching is not permitted, and grabbing an opponent's shirt ("holding") is also not allowed.

The fastest way to make ground is by kicking the ball upfield and out of play whenever it comes sideways out of the Bully; unlike most types of football, play is restarted opposite where the ball stops after it had gone out, or was touched after it had gone out.

Consequently, the most common tactic revolves around the formation of a 'phalanx'. This consists of a tunnel (coming out from the wall, diagonally forward from the position of the ball) of players from one team who are crouching on hands and feet next to each other. Once the team in possession of the ball has formed a successful phalanx, it attempts to pass the ball down the 'tunnel' using the knees of the players forming it, to a player standing at the end of the phalanx (i.e. furthest away from the Wall), known as Lines, whose job it is to kick the ball upfield. The team not in possession is constantly attempting to disrupt this, and win the ball back.

The game lasts up to 55 minutes, with two halves of 25 minutes each and an additional 5 minutes as half-time break. Many games end 0-0. Goals (worth ten points) are very rare; they occur about once every 10 years, and no goals have been scored in the St Andrew's Day game since 1909. A goal was scored in a recent scratch match (a less formal warm-up match for the St Andrew's Day game) in May 2016 by a College player. However, shies (worth 1 point) are scored more frequently.

In the 2016 game, the 250th St. Andrew's Day match, College triumphed 1–0 against the Oppidans. This was the 107th consecutive St Andrew's Day match in which no goals were scored by either team; however, College scored a shy.

==Organisation==

The Wall Game is organised entirely by boys, particularly by the Keepers (captains) of College Wall, Oppidan Wall and Mixed Wall. Famous past players of the Wall Game include [[Boris Johnson]], who was Keeper of the College Wall, [[George Orwell]] and [[Harold Macmillan]].{{cn|date=August 2015}} The First World War flying ace [[Arthur Rhys Davids]] also played, representing College with [[Ralph Dominic Gamble]] in 1915.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

Members of the College Wall also annually commemorate the outstanding player and Keeper of the Wall [[Logie Leggatt]], who was killed in the First World War at the age of 22, making a toast at each year's Christmas Sock Supper with the words ''in piam memoriam L.C.L'' (in affectionate memory of L.C.L). Despite its renown outside the school, only a very small number of the 250 or so boys in each year group ever take part in the sport, unlike the lesser-known but much more widely played [[Eton Field Game]].{{cn|date=August 2015}}

The Eton Wall Game has been played twice by all-female teams.{{cn|date=August 2015}}

==In popular culture==

In 1948, the game was televised by the BBC. When shared by the BBC Archive on social media in 2017, it was described as "baffling", and the televising as "rubbish".&lt;ref name="BBC Archive - 1948: Newsreel: Eton Wall Game"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BBCArchive/videos/491679074538461/|website=Facebook|publisher=BBC Archive|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British sitcom]] ''[[Green Wing]]'' features a fictional game, [[Guyball]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|iː|b|ɔː|l}}), which parodies the obscurity of public school pastimes such as the Eton wall game. It is introduced by [[Guy Secretan]], who learned the sport at the fictional school Whiteleaf &lt;span style="white-space:nowrap"&gt;({{IPAc-en|ˈ|hw|ɪ|t|l|ɪ|f}}).&lt;/span&gt; The object of the game is to throw balls in a "Topmiler", a wicker basket on top of a leather flying helmet. However, the rules of Guyball are never fully explained and are designed to be as confusing and as difficult to understand as possible. Fans of the show have however created their own rules, and the game was occasionally played 'for real'.

In [[Terry Pratchett]]'s [[Discworld]] series, the [[Ankh-Morpork Assassins' Guild]] has a far more sadistic variant of the "Wall Game", and is essentially an extreme hybrid of rock-climbing and [[dodgeball]].

In the first of [[Charlie Higson]]'s [[Young Bond]] novels, ''[[SilverFin]]'', the young James Bond comes to Eton and learns the rules of the Wall Game.

The game was a subject of the 1987 book, ''The Sports Hall of Shame'', by [[Bruce Nash]] and [[Allan Zullo]].

[[Robert Ludlum]]'s novel ''[[The  Bancroft Strategy]]'' briefly describes the game, saying "I believe the last time a goal was scored on a St. Andrew's day match was in 1909, if you can believe it."

[[Frederick Forsyth]]'s novel [[The Cobra (novel)|The Cobra]] has a passing reference to the Wall Game.

[[Len Deighton]]'s nameless protagonist in ''[[The IPCRESS File]]'', in passing, compares the scene boarding an aeroplane to the Eton Wall Game.

'''European dragons''' are [[legendary creature]]s in [[folklore]] and [[mythology]] among the overlapping [[culture of Europe|cultures of Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illustrated Book of Dragons and Dragon Lore|year=2013|publisher=Cognoscenti Books|author=Ernest Ingersoll|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both the [[Modern history|modern period]] and [[Ancient history|ancient period]], the European dragon is typically depicted as a large, fire-breathing, scaly, horned, [[lizard]]-like creature; the creature also has leathery, bat-like wings, four legs, and a long, muscular prehensile tail. Some depictions show dragons with feathered wings, crests, ear frills, fiery manes, [[ivory]] spikes running down its spine, and various exotic decorations.

In folktales, dragon's blood often contains unique powers, keeping them alive for longer or giving them poisonous or acidic properties. The typical Christian dragon protects a cavern or castle filled with [[gold]] and [[treasure]]. An evil dragon is often associated with a great hero who tries to slay it, and a good one is said to give support or wise advice.

Though a winged creature, the dragon is generally to be found in its underground [[wikt:lair|lair]], a cave that identifies it as an ancient creature of earth.

English "dragon" derives (via Middle English, Old French, and Latin) from Ancient Greek δράκων ''drákōn'', "serpent, dragon" or literally "to see" i.e. "sharp-sighted one".&lt;ref&gt;Wyld, H.C. (1960) ''Universal Dictionary of the English Language'', Waverley Books, London, p.334.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word probably derives from an Aryan base ''derk-'' meaning "to see" and the Sanskrit ''dŗç-'' also signifying "to see".&lt;ref&gt;Skeat, W.W. (1958) ''Etymological Dictionary of the English Language'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, p.181.&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding their folkloric associations, there is no etymological connection between ''dragons'' and the ghoulish figures known as [[Draugr|draugar]] in Old Norse, who haunt rich [[Tumulus|burial mounds]].

[[File:Dacian Draco.svg|thumb|right|The [[Dacian Draco]].]]

Roman dragons evolved from serpentine Greek ones, combined with the dragons of the [[Near East]], in the mix that characterized the hybrid Greek/Eastern [[Hellenistic]] culture. From [[Babylon]], the ''[[Sirrush|muš-ḫuššu]]'' was a classic representation of a Near Eastern dragon. John's ''[[Book of Revelation]]''—Greek literature, not Roman—describes [[Satan]] as "a great dragon, flaming red, with seven heads and ten horns". Much of John's literary inspiration is late Hebrew and Greek, but John's dragon is more likely to be symbolizing the dragons from the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Howard|title=Leviathan and the Beast in Revelation|journal=The Biblical Archaeologist|year=1948|pages=61–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kiessling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiessling|first=Nicolas K.|title=Antecedents of the Medieval Dragon in Sacred History|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|year=1970|volume=89|issue=2|pages=167–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Roman Empire, each military cohort had a particular identifying ''signum'' (military standard), after the [[Parthia]]n and [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]] of [[Trajan]] in the east, the [[Dacian Draco]] military standard entered the Legion with the ''Cohors Sarmatarum'' and ''Cohors Dacorum'' ([[Sarmatian]] and [[Dacians|Dacian]] [[Cohort (military unit)|cohorts]])—[[Draco (military standard)|a large dragon fixed to the end of a lance]], with large, gaping jaws of silver and with the rest of the body formed of colored silk.

Several personifications of evil or allusions to dragon in the [[Old Testament]] are translated as forms of ''draco'' in [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate Bible|Vulgate]]. e.g Deuteronomy (32:33),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/deuteronomy.shtml#32 (accessed 29th March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Job (30:29),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/job.shtml#30 (accessed 29th March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Psalms (73:13, 90:13 &amp; 43:20),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/psalms.shtml#73 (accessed 29th March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/psalms.shtml#90 (accessed 29th March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/psalms.shtml#143 (accessed 29th March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Isaiah (13:21, 27:1, 34:13 &amp; 43:20),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/isaiah.shtml#13 (accessed 29th March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/isaiah.shtml#27 (accessed 29th March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/isaiah.shtml#34 (accessed 29th March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/isaiah.shtml#43 (accessed 29th March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremiah (9:11),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/jeremiah.shtml#9  (accessed 29th March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Micah (1:8)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/micah.html (accessed 29th March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; and Malachi (1:3).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/malachias.html (accessed 29th March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dragons in Greek mythology often guard treasure such as Ladon, a hundred headed dragon which guarded the tree of Herdias until he was slain by Heracles. Likewise Python guarded the oracle of Delphi until he was likewise slain by Apollo out of revenge for Python tormenting his mother. The Lerneaen Hydra, a multiple headed serpentine swamp monster is said to be a dragon, being killed by Heracles later, but the matter if he is a true dragon or not is still over controversy.

== Middle Ages ==

=== Continental dragons ===

[[Dragons]] are usually shown in modern times with a body more like a huge [[lizard]], or a snake with two pairs of lizard-type legs, and able to emit fire from their mouths. This traces back to the continental dragon, commonly referred to as a '''fire-breathing dragon'''. The continental, like many other European dragons, has bat-like wings growing from its back.

In [[Western folklore]], dragon-like creatures and christian dragons are usually portrayed as evil, with the exceptions mainly in [[Asturias|Asturian]] and [[Welsh folklore]] and modern fiction. In the modern period and late medieval times, the European dragon is typically depicted as a huge fire-breathing, scaly, and horned lizard-like creature, with (leathery, bat-like) wings, with two to four legs and a long muscular tail. It is sometimes shown with feathered wings, a crest, a fiery mane, ivory spikes running down its spine and various exotic colorations. Dragon's blood often has magical properties. The typical dragon protects a [[cavern]] or [[castle]] filled with gold and treasure and is often associated with a great hero who tries to slay it. Though a winged creature, the dragon is generally to be found in its underground lair, a cave that identifies it as an ancient creature of earth.

Classical European dragons are often described as illuminating the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast262.htm|title=Medieval Bestiary : Dragon|work=bestiary.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often taken by Christian writers{{who|date=January 2017}} as a metaphor for [[Lucifer]] as the "angel of light".

The poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' describes a ''draca'' (dragon) also as ''wyrm'' (worm, or serpent) and its movements by the Anglo-Saxon verb ''bugan'', "to bend", and says that it has a [[venom]]ous bite; all of these indicate a snake-like form and movement rather than with a lizard-like or dinosaur-like body as in later belief (though the [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|dragon]] of Beowulf does show several features that would later become popularized with dragons–namely, it breathes fire–lives underground, and collects treasure).

=== Germanic dragon-like creatures: Lindworms ===
{{Main|Lindworm}}
The most famous lindworm in [[Norse mythology|Norse and Germanic mythology]] is [[Fafnir]]

The Germanic stories of lindworms have them guarding a treasure hoard. The Fafnir lindworm guarded [[wikt:Barrow|earthen mounds]] full of ancient treasure. The treasure was cursed and brought ill to those who later possessed it.

=== Germanic dragon-like creatures: Sea serpents ===
{{Main|Sea serpent}}
Sea serpents are also called orms in Nordic languages, wyrms in Old English and worms in Middle English.
These "dragons" are usually evil, much like dragon-like creatures of Greece and other dragons of Continental Europe; however, there are exceptions, and many do not want to go to battle unless they feel threatened. These serpents are limbless and wingless. The most famous sea serpent in [[Norse mythology]] is [[Jörmungandr]], who is actually a giant born into the body of a serpent by the Norse god Loki, who will one day kill Thor, Norse god of thunder.

=== Welsh Dragon ===
{{Main|Y Ddraig Goch}}
[[File:Flag of Wales 2.svg|thumb|right|The [[flag of Wales|Welsh flag]], showing a red dragon [[Attitude (heraldry)|passant]]]]

The red dragon features on, and is the name of the national flag of Wales (''[[Y Ddraig Goch]]''). The symbol may originate in [[Arthurian Legend]], or more likely from the Celtic dragon God Dewi (not to be confused for [[Saint David]] by later Christian era). Employed by [[Gwrtheyrn]], [[Myrddin Wyllt|Merlin]] tells of a vision of the red dragon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Thomas|title=The Story of Myrddin and the Five Dreams of Gwenddydd in the Chronicle of Elis Gruffydd|journal=Etudes celtiques|year=1958–59|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (representing the [[Brython|Britons]]) and the [[white dragon]] (representing the invading [[Saxons]]) fighting beneath [[Dinas Emrys]]. This particular legend also features in the [[Mabinogion]] in the story of ''[[Lludd and Llefelys]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Sioned|title=The Mabinogion|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heinz|first=Sabine|title=Celtic Symbols|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Pub.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dragon was used as a predominant symbol of Welsh leaders throughout history, such as [[Owain Glyndŵr]] and [[Henry VII of England]].

=== Slavic dragon-like creatures: Alas ===
{{Main|Ala (demon)}}

In south Slavic mythology there are two types of this dragon-like creatures, alas and zmeys. It is said that a very old snake can become and metamorph into an ala. Some depictions of alas are confusingly said to have the bodies of women. Other alas look similarly to dragons. The number of heads on an ala may vary. Alas are enemies of the zmeys and it is sometimes said in south Slavic folklore that thunder is a product of alas and zmeys fighting. Alas are considered evil or malevolent in south Slavic folklore,  while zmeys are usually considered good or benevolent.

=== Slavic dragon-like creatures: Zmeys ===
[[File:Змей Горыныч.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Zmey Gorynych]], by [[Victor Vasnetsov]]]]
{{Main|Slavic dragon}}

Dragon-like creatures of [[Slavic mythology]] hold mixed temperaments towards humans. For example, Drakons (дракон, змей, ламя, (х)ала) in [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] mythology are either male or female, each gender having a different view of mankind. The female dragon and male dragon, often seen as sister and brother, represent different forces of [[agriculture]]. The female dragon represents harsh weather and is the destroyer of crops, the hater of mankind, and is locked in a never-ending battle with her brother. The male dragon protects the humans' crops from destruction and is generally benevolent to humanity. [[Fire]] and water play major roles in Bulgarian dragon lore: the female has water characteristics, while the male is usually a fiery creature. In Bulgarian legend, The drakons are three-headed, winged beings with [[snake]]'s bodies, in other words wyvern fuses with a green hydra.

In [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]], [[Russians|Russian]], [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], [[Bosniaks|Bosnian]], [[Serbs|Serbian]], and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] lore, the dragon-like creature, or "змей" ({{Lang-bg|Змей}}), ''[[zmey]]'' ({{Lang-ru|Змей}}), ''smok'' ({{Lang-be|Цмок}}), [[Slavic dragon|''zmiy'']] ({{Lang-uk|Змій}}), ([[Bosniaks|Bosnian]] zmaj), ({{Lang-sr|змај or zmaj}}), ''zmej'' ({{Lang-mk|змеј}}), is generally an evil, four-legged beast with few, if any, redeeming qualities. ''Zmeys'' are intelligent, but not greatly so, often demanding tribute from villages or small towns in the form of [[maiden]]s (for food), or [[gold]]. Their number of heads ranges from one to seven or sometimes even more, with three- and seven-headed Zmeys being most common. The heads also regrow if cut off, unless the neck is "treated" with fire (similar to the hydra in Greek mythology). [[Zmey#Blood|Zmey blood]] is so poisonous that Earth itself will refuse to absorb it. In Bulgarian mythology these "dragons" are sometimes good, opposing the evil Lamya /ламя/, a beast that shares a likeness with the ''zmey''.

The most famous [[Poland|Polish]] dragon ({{Lang-pl|Smok}}) is the [[Wawel Dragon]] or ''[[Smok Wawelski]]'', the Dragon of Wawel Hill. It supposedly terrorized ancient [[Kraków]] and lived in caves on the [[Vistula]] river bank below the [[Wawel]] castle. According to lore based on the ''[[Book of Daniel]]'', it was killed by a boy who offered it a [[Sheepskin (material)|sheepskin]] filled with sulphur and tar. After devouring it, the dragon became so thirsty that it finally exploded after drinking too much water. In the oldest, 12th-century version of this fantasy tale, written by [[Wincenty Kadłubek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=[[Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae|Kronika Polska]]|author=[[Wincenty Kadłubek|Mistrz Wincenty (tzw. Kadłubek)]]|publisher=[[Ossolineum]], [[Wrocław]]|year=2008|isbn=83-04-04613-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; dragon was defeated by two sons of a [[King Krak]], [[Krakus II]] and [[Lech II]]. A metal sculpture of the Wawel Dragon is a well-known tourist sight in Kraków. The Wawel Dragon is the coat of arms of the Polish princes, Piasts of Czersk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Górczyk|first=Wojciech|title=Ślady recepcji legend arturiańskich w heraldyce Piastów czerskich i kronikach polskich|journal=Kultura i Historia|year=2010|url=http://www.kulturaihistoria.umcs.lublin.pl/archives/1793|accessdate=14 July 2013|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other dragon-like creatures in Polish folklore include the [[basilisk]], living in cellars of [[Warsaw]], and the Snake King from folk legends, though neither are explicitly dragons.

=== Iberian "dragon"s ===
[[File:Galician dragon (Medieval Age).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dragon in a granite Relief (14th century). San Anton Museum ([[A Coruña]], [[Galicia (Spain)]]).]]

Iberian "dragons" are almost always evil, such as the [[Cuélebre]], or Cuelebre, a giant winged serpent in the mythology of [[Asturias]] and [[Cantabria]] in the north of Spain. It usually lives in a cave, guards treasures and keeps nymph-like beings called ''[[xana]]s'' or ''[[Anjana (Cantabrian mythology)|anjanas]]'' as prisoners.

There is a legend that a "dragon" dwelled in the Peña Uruel mountain near [[Jaca]] saying that it could mesmerise people with its glance, so the young man who decided to kill the beast equipped himself with a shiny shield, such that the dragon's glance would be reflected. When the young man arrived at the cave where the dragon lived, he could kill it easily because the dragon mesmerised itself. This legend is very similar to the Greek myth of [[Medusa]].

[[File:Moralia in Job MS dragonslayer.jpg|thumb|upright|Illumination in a 12th-century manuscript of a letter from [[Saint Gregory]]'s to [[Leander of Seville|St. Leander]] (Bibl. Municipale, MS 2, [[Dijon]])]]

[[Herensuge]] is the name given to the "dragon" in [[Basque mythology]], meaning "last serpent". The most famous legend has [[Archangel Michael|St. Michael]] descend from [[Heaven]] to kill it, but only once did [[God]] agree to accompany him in person.
[[Sugaar]], the Basque male god, is often associated with the serpent or dragon but able to take other forms as well. His name can be read as "male serpent".

Dragons are well-known in [[Catalan myths and legends]], in no small part because [[Saint George|St. George]] (Catalan ''Sant Jordi'') is the patron saint of [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]]. Like most mythical reptiles, the Catalan dragon (Catalan ''drac'') is an enormous serpent-like creature with four legs and a pair of wings, or rarely, a two legged creature with a pair of wings, called a wyvern, which isn't a dragon. As in many other parts of the world, the dragon's face may be like that of some other animal, such as a [[lion]] or [[bull]]. As is common elsewhere, Catalan dragons are fire-breathers, and the dragon-fire is all-consuming. Catalan dragons also can emit a fetid odor, which can rot away anything it touches.

The Catalans also distinguish a ''víbria'' or ''vibra'' (cognate with English ''[[Viperidae|viper]]'' and ''[[wyvern]]''), a female dragon-like creature with two prominent breasts, two claws &amp; two wings and an [[eagle]]'s beak. Dracs, Víbries and other mythological figures used to participate in [[correfoc]]s during popular celebrations.

In Portuguese mythology, [[Cuco|Coca]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corpo de Deus|url=http://www.cm-moncao.pt/portal/page/moncao/portal_municipal/Turismo/Corpo%20de%20Deus|publisher=Municipal de Monção|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a female wyvern that battles Saint George on the Corpus Christi holiday. The fighting has a symbolic meaning: when the coca defeats Saint George the crops will be bad and there will be famine and death; when Saint George defeats the coca he cuts off her tongue and ears, the crops will have a good year and it announces prosperity. Still, she is called "saint" coca just as George is called saint, and the people cheer for her.

Another dragon called '''drago''' is also represented in Portuguese mythology and used to take part in celebrations during the Middle Ages.

=== Italian dragons ===
[[File:Saint Margaret sculpture.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Saint Margaret and the Dragon'', alabaster with traces of gilding, Toulouse, ''ca'' 1475 ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]])]]
[[File:MasoDiBanco.jpg|thumb|"Saint Silvestro resurrects two magicians, and the Fornole dragon", Vernio Bardi Chapel, Santa Croce (Florence)]]
[[File:Terni-Stemma.png|thumb|upright|Thyrus, the wyvern of Terni]]

Wyverns are usually evil in Italy, and there are many stories of wyverns being slain. Dragons also trick demons in Italian legends. The legend of [[Saint George]] and the wyvern is well known in Italy, but other saints are also depicted fighting wyverns. For instance, the first bishop of [[Forlì]], [[Saint Mercurialis]], was said to have killed a wyvern to save the city, so he is often depicted in the act of slaying a wyvern. Likewise, the first patron saint of [[Venice]], [[Theodore of Amasea|Saint Theodore of Tyro]], was a wyvern-slayer, and a statue representing his slaying of the wyvern still tops one of the two columns in [[St Mark's Basilica|St. Mark's]] square. [[St. Michael]], the patron saint of [[paratrooper]]s, is also frequently depicted slaying a wyvern.

According to the [[Golden Legend]], compiled by the Italian [[Jacobus de Voragine]], [[Saint Margaret the Virgin]] was swallowed by [[Satan]] in the shape of a hydra, from whence she escaped alive when the [[cross]] she carried irritated the hydra's innards. The Golden Legend, in an atypical moment of scepticism, describes this last incident as "apocryphal and not to be taken seriously" (trans. Ryan, 1.369), which did not prevent the legend from being popular and getting artistic treatments.

More prevalent are the legends about dragons in Italy, particularly in [[Umbria]]. One of the most famous wyverns of Italian folklore is [[Thyrus]], a [[wyvern]] that besieged [[Terni]] in the Middle Ages. One day, a young and brave knight of the noble House of Cittadini, tired of witnessing the death of his fellow citizens and depopulation of Terni, faced the wyvern and killed him. From that day, the town assumed the creature in its coat of arms, accompanied by a Latin inscription: "Thyrus et amnis dederunt signa Teramnis" (English translation: "Thyrus and the river gave their insignia to [the city of] Terni"), that stands under the banner of the town of Terni, honoring this legend.

Another poem tells of another dragon that lived near the village of [[Fornole]], near Terni in the south of Umbria. Pope [[Sylvester I]] arrived in Umbria and freed the population of Fornole from the ferocity of the dragon, pacifying the dragon. Grateful for his deed, the population built a small church dedicated to the saint on the top of the mountain near the dragon's lair in the 13th century. In the apse of the church there is a fresco representing the iconography of the saint.

== Heraldry ==
[[File:Erb Svaty jur.gif|thumb|right|280px|Coat of arms of the [[town]] [[Svätý Jur]] (''eng. Saint George'') in Western [[Slovakia]].]]
In England, to this day, a rampant red dragon (clutching a mace) is the heraldic symbol of the county of [[Somerset]]. The county once formed part of the early-medieval [[Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Wessex]] in western England, which too bore a dragon, or [[wyvern]] (a two-legged dragon-like creature, as opposed to a four-legged dragon), as a symbol. The Wessex beast is usually colored gold in illustrations.

According to the writer on heraldry [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]], the red dragon of Wales on the flag originated with the [[Heraldic flag#Standard|standard]] of the 7th-century king, [[Cadwaladr]], and was used as a [[Supporters (heraldry)|supporter]] by the [[Tudor dynasty]] (who were of Welsh origin).&lt;ref name="Fox-Davies225"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fox-Davies|first=Arthur Charles|title=A complete guide to heraldry|year=1909|publisher=Gramercy Books|location=New York|isbn=0-517-26643-1|pages=225–6|url=http://openlibrary.org/details/completeguidetoh00foxdrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Elizabeth, however, preferring gold, changed the royal mantle and the dragon supporter from red to gold [[gules]].&lt;ref name="Fox-Davies225" /&gt; There may be some doubt of the Welsh origin of the dragon supporter of the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal arms]], but it certainly was used by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]].&lt;ref name="Fox-Davies225" /&gt;

The Welsh flag reads ''parti per fess Argent and Vert; a dragon Gules passant''. Welsh rugby teams include the [[Dragons (rugby union)|Newport Gwent Dragons]] and the [[Cardiff City Blue Dragons]].

King [[Peter IV of Aragon]] used a dragon on his helmet to show that he was the king of [[Aragon]], as a [[heraldic pun]] (''Rei d'Aragón'', ''dragón'').

[[File:Coat of Arms of the Kingdom of Portugal 1640-1910 (3).svg|Grande Real Brasão de Armas|thumb|right|148px|[[Kingdom of Portugal]]]]
A dragon was used as the crest of the [[coat of arms of Portugal|Greater Royal Coat of Arms of Portugal]] since at least the 14th century. Later, two wyverns were used as [[supporter (heraldry)|supporters]] of the shield of the Arms of Portugal. In the 19th century, King [[Peter IV of Portugal]] granted the city of [[Porto]] the incorporation of the dragon crest of the Royal Coat of arms in its municipal coat of arms, in gratitude for the support given to him by the city during the [[Liberal Wars]]. The badge of the [[FC Porto]] incorporates the old Porto municipal coat of arms with the dragon crest and this is why the dragon was adopted as the [[mascot|animal mascot]] of the club.

[[Beta Theta Pi]] uses the dragon as part of its crest.

== Early Modern dragons ==
The [[emblem book]]s popular from late medieval times through the 17th century often represent the dragon as an emblem of greed. &lt;!--Some quotes are needed--&gt; The prevalence of dragons in European [[heraldry]] demonstrates that there is more to the dragon than greed.

== Modern dragons ==
[[File:West Edmonton Mall-Fire Dragon.jpg|thumb|[[West Edmonton Mall]]'s fire-breathing dragon animatronic. Removed in 2014 due to high maintenance costs and its drying-out rubber skin]]
[[Agosti Xaho]], a romantic myth creator of the 19th century, fused these myths in his own creation of ''Leherensuge'', the first and last serpent, that, in his newly coined legend, would arise again some time in the future bringing the rebirth of the [[Basque people|Basque nation]].

Dragons have long been portrayed in modern times as greedy treasure-hoarders, lusting for gold and precious gems. In such stories as ''Beowulf'', it is the theft of such treasure that sparks a dragon's fury. In the [[fantasy]] genre, however, there has been a trend of originally depicting dragons in a positive light: as allies instead of enemies, the red dragon of Wales, and the brother dragon of Poland. Dragons are increasingly viewed as friends of humans and as highly intelligent and noble creatures, while still remaining the fearsome beasts of legend. They are frequently shown as guardians and close friends of individual humans.

Many of these modern ideas were first popularised by [[Anne McCaffrey]] with her ''[[Dragonriders of Pern]]'' series, with later authors such as [[Christopher Paolini]] also depicting sympathetic dragon characters in ''[[Eragon]]''. [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] created a meaningful image of dragons in her books about [[Earthsea]]. Ffyrnig, the Last Great Dragon of ''[[Legend of the Heart Eaters]]'', the first book in the story of ''[[Jonah and the Last Great Dragon]]'' by [[M.E.Holley]] is based on an actual legend of the Welsh Borders, which tells that the last great dragon is asleep under the Radnor Forest, imprisoned there by St. Michael. Bryan Davis' Dragons in our Midst depicts dragons as noble and kind beasts, having the ability to marry and reproduce with humans.

{{See Wiktionary|the vestment|falda}}

The '''falda''' is a particular [[papal vestment]] that forms a long skirt extending beneath the hem of the [[alb]]. When it is worn, the skirts of the falda are so long that the [[Pope]] needs train-bearers both in front and behind while he walks. It was used when the Pope celebrated Mass.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12232a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of vestment has its origins in the 15th century and earlier. It was initially made of cream-coloured silk and worn over the alb and under the [[chasuble]] or [[cope]]. It can be used in papal funerals, where it was draped over the body when it lay in state. It has, since the Pontificate of [[Paul VI]], fallen into disuse.

A '''funerary cult''' is a body of [[anthropology of religion|religious]] teaching and practice centered on the [[veneration of the dead]], in which the living are thought to be able to confer benefits on the dead in the [[afterlife]] or to appease their otherwise wrathful [[ghost]]s. Rituals were carried on for the benefit of the dead, either by their relatives or by a class of [[priest]]s appointed and paid to perform the rites. These rituals took place at the [[tomb]]s of the dead themselves or at [[mortuary temple]]s appointed to this purpose. Funerary cults are found in a wide variety of cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Yayoi Shirai, "Ideal and reality in Old Kingdom private funerary cults", in ''The Old Kingdom Art and Archaeology'', Miroslav Bárta, ed.;  (Czech Institute of Egyptology, 2004), pp. [http://www.gizapyramids.org/pdf%20library/shirai_okaa_2006.pdf 325 et. seq.], accessed June 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable cults==

===Egypt===
Funerary cults are especially associated with [[ancient Egypt]], where it was common for royalty, those associated with royalty, cats, and the wealthy to be mummified. This practice was done so as to preserve their bodies for the journey to the afterlife. The [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] [[Osiris]], who was the [[dying and reviving god]] and Lord of the Egyptian afterlife, was usually depicted as a [[mummy]] in [[Egyptian art]]. Also at [[Bubastis]], where Bast was worshiped, there was a massive cat cemetery. Cats were also thought to journey to the afterlife, usually to join their owners. These needed their own material goods for this journey, such as food.&lt;ref&gt;(p50 1910 encyclopedia  Britannica)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Empire===
The [[Roman Empire]] also had a funerary cult, revolving around Dionysus.  Dionysus, (along with being lord of wine and parties) had been reborn many times and had rescued his mother Semele from the Underworld (the Roman afterlife, ruled by Hades). Each [[Roman God]] had his or her own clique of devotees, and it was thought that Dionysus could protect his initiates from death. He was also one of the Gods associated with plants (grapes in particular) and harvest.  He was occasionally depicted in conjunction with other Gods (representatives of rebirth or plants of some kind) to indicate the dead also participated in the rejuvenation of the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;(The cults of the Roman Empire By Robert Turcan, p 312-313)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesopotamia===
In [[Sumer]], [[Assyria]], and [[Babylonia]], funerary cults were called ''kispu.'' This funerary cult mostly revolved around caring for deceased kin, with a specific family member assigned to providing for a specific ghost. The ghosts were provided with food and other goods, however the provision of clean water was of particular importance. Both deceased men and women were supposed to receive this care.  Without this care, the dead had the potential to become a malicious supernatural force.  With this care, the dead family continue to participate in the lives of the living family. Also, the practice of recycling the names of the deceased allowed for familial continuity. In Assyria, this was done by any consanguineal kin. A Babylonian variation of this cult treats the veneration of the dead as an extension of the veneration for parents. Offspring were responsible for this care. Scholar Miranda Bayliss had stated the function of this cult was to alleviate guilt and other tensions from the death of the deceased and form solidarity and continuity within the family. Typically only close kin received this care. When ancestors beyond the individual's grandparents were venerated, it was done at large gatherings of extended kin groups. This also functioned to promote solidarity within the larger kin group.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Bayliss, "The Cult of Dead Kin in Assyria and Babylonia", ''Iraq'', v. 35, no. 2. seq.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4199959]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bram Jagersma, "The Calendar of the Funerary Cult in Ancient Lagash", ''Bibliotheca Orientalis'', v.: 64 nos: 3-4, pp 289-307 [http://poj.peeters-leuven.be/content.php?id=2023945&amp;url=article]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
The ancient [[Greek hero cult]] was also a funerary cult; in the original sense, a ''[[hero]]'' was a deified or [[demigod|semi-divine]] ancestor, worshiped at a shrine for his power to assist the living. The ancient Greek religion had three main aspect: the Gods, the heroes, and the dead. The dead are powerless and the Gods all-powerful, while the heroes are dead (live only in legend and memory) and are powerful. Heroes occupy a liminal space between the Gods and mortals. Mortals sacrificed livestock and plants at Heroes' tombs to intervene and commune with the Gods on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;A companion to Greek Religion, by Daniel Ogden, p113-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian Peninsula===
The [[Samnium|Samnite]]s and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] of the Italian peninsula, who painted the underworld deities [[Aita]], [[Vanth]], [[Phersipnei]], and Letham on the walls of tombs.&lt;ref&gt;G.

The '''Geschwind–Galaburda hypothesis''' was proposed by [[Norman Geschwind]] and Albert Galaburda to explain [[Biology of gender|sex differences]] in [[cognition|cognitive]] abilities by relating them to [[lateralization of brain function]].  The basic idea is that differences in maturation rates between the [[cerebral hemispheres]] are mediated by circulating [[Androgen|testosterone]] levels, and that sexual maturation acts to fix the hemispheres at different relative stages of development after [[puberty]].

According to the theory, male brains mature later than females, and the left hemisphere matures later than the right.

'''''Glorious Appearing: The End of Days''''' is the 12th book in the [[Left Behind]] series by [[Tim LaHaye]] and [[Jerry B. Jenkins]]. Released on Tuesday, March 30, 2004, this book sees the surviving believers awaiting the return of Jesus Christ as the war of Armageddon and the seven-year Tribulation period draws to its climax. It was on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for 22 weeks.

==Plot summary==
The [[Antichrist]] has assembled the armies of the world in the Valley of [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]] for what he believes will be his ultimate triumph of the ages. With a victory here, he would ascend to the throne of God.
The Tribulation Force has migrated to the Middle East, most ensconced at Petra with the Jewish Remnant, now more than a million strong. [[Petra]] is surrounded by the Unity Army, poised to destroy all that is left of God's people and usher in [[Nicolae Carpathia]]'s [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|new world order]].

The world holds its breath as the greatest military battle to ever take place threatens to obliterate all that remains of humanity. All seems lost. Tsion Ben-Judah and Buck Williams have been slain in [[Jerusalem]], now overrun by [[Global Community]] forces. The hour of attack for Nicolae Carpathia’s Global Community Unity Army to assault the Rebels at the Temple Mount draws near. Mac McCullum goes to Jerusalem undercover to find Buck Williams and discovers his dead body before being ushered to a meeting with several more troops and Nicolae Carpathia's cabinet in Solomon's Stables. After witnessing Chaim Rosensweig preaching at Petra through live television and the death of a Global Community Officer, Satan temporarily leaves Carpathia's body and reminds the now trembling, feeble shell of Nicolae Carpathia that he is merely a shell for him before indwelling him once again.

Rayford is greatly wounded from a Global Community mortar attack on Petra's perimeter and is left on the brink of death before being discovered by Leah Rose and Abdullah and brought back to Petra in heavy bandages due to his injuries. As Mac returns and Chaim visits Rayford as night falls, the sun and moon go out before the stars and meteors fall upon the Global Community army, slightly reducing their numbers before the Sign of the Son of Man (a giant cross) appears and heals Rayford and all other saved and undecided of their injuries, causing many to become saved, including one third of the Jewish Remnant.

This does not dissuade the enemies of God, as the Unity Army, led by the Antichrist, Nicolae Carpathia himself, makes their final charge against Petra, seeking to annihilate all remaining rebels against the Global Community. But suddenly, as Nicolae begins leading the attack, the cross disappears from the sky as the Global Community's weaponry is rendered useless. Suddenly, the whole world is covered in a blinding light as the entire earth sees Jesus Christ coming in power and glory out of Heaven with the Armies and Raptured Saints of Heaven. As Jesus speaks, the entire third of the Global Community forces and Carpathia loyalists at Petra are slain with Nicolae and Leon fleeing to [[Bozrah]]. The Remnant at Petra are suddenly blessed with the ability to run at superhuman speeds, allowing them to arrive at Bozrah right before Jesus obliterates all the Global Community forces there and temporarily descends to the fields of Bozrah and stains his robe with blood, fulfilling the Prophecy of Isaiah 63:1-6 of Jesus trampling the enemies of God.

With Carpathia's forces gone in Bozrah, Nicolae and Leon board a helicopter to the Valley of [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] where the other two thirds of the Unity Army are stationed. As the Remnant passes the Valley to get to Jerusalem, Rayford, Abdullah and Mac drive to a ledge of the Valley of Megiddo and witness Jesus obliterating the remaining two thirds of the Unity Army which are not at Jerusalem or around the world with the Seventh Bowl judgement and a loud cry from God in Heaven shouting "IT IS DONE!" . Viv Ivins is killed by a large hailstone crushing her before Nicolae and Leon escape the rising swamp of blood and gore of the fallen Global Community troops and make for Jerusalem in a [[Humvee]].

As Rayford, Mac, Abdullah and the rest of the Remnant arrive at Jerusalem, so does Nicolae and Leon, welcomed by Global Community loyalists. Nicolae mounts horseback, preparing to attack the Rebels at the Temple Mount before the horses are afflicted with a flesh-dissolving plague. Jesus appears in the sky again with the Armies of Heaven and Nicolae orders missiles shot at Jesus but to no avail. As the Global Community troops at Jerusalem die, Nicolae and Leon along with what's left of the Global Community forces arrive at the [[Mount of Olives]] as Jesus dismounts and descends onto the Mount of Olives, causing a great earthquake that splits the Mount of Olives in two. The last of the Global Community forces at Jerusalem die as Nicolae and Leon flee for safety. The Mount of Olives splitting also ushers in the largest Global Earthquake ever felt, completely flattening the world and causing Jerusalem to rise more than three hundred feet. The remaining Global Community forces and Carpathia loyalists bearing the [[Number of the Beast|Mark of the Beast]] are killed simultaneously by the Word of God and the Global Community is finally dissolved.

Jesus enters through the East Gate into Jerusalem and calls all the Christians to him where he comforts them. [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], the [[archangel]], captures Nicolae Carpathia, Leon Fortunato along with Ashtaroth, Baal, and Cankerworm. Jesus personally shames Ashtaroth, Baal, and Cankerworm before destroying them. Leon is driven to tears and attempts to renounce Nicolae and Satan before being sentenced to eternity in the [[Lake of fire|Lake of Fire]]. Nicolae at first refuses to bow to Jesus until Jesus casts Satan out of him, causing Nicolae to revert to what he would look like if Satan had not caused him to come back to life three and a half years prior. The feeble, elderly and rotting remains of what was Nicolae Carpathia bows to Jesus before confessing that Jesus is Lord and the Son of God along with confessing that he wasted his entire life on personal gain in his quest for power. Jesus then opens a hole in the ground which leads directly to the Lake of Fire before Nicolae Carpathia and Leon Fortunato are thrown into it and enter into eternal torment.

Michael then captures Satan and Jesus personally lays the charges on him, going back to the original rebellion in Heaven. Michael then chains Satan up and binds him before throwing him into the Bottomless Pit, where he will remain until the end of Jesus' 1,000-year reign. Jesus then departs for the Temple's throne as Believers find one another and find temporary lodging in houses and residential areas in Jerusalem.

The next day, Jesus gathers the entire remaining population of the earth in the [[Valley of Josaphat|Valley of Jehosaphat]] where the Sheep and Goats judgement occurs. Jesus banishes all those who still haven't accepted him as their saviour to [[Hell]] before resurrecting the dead Tribulation Saints and [[Old Testament]] saints before giving all of them their rewards. The Tribulation Saints along with the Raptured Church then re-unite with the surviving Tribulation Saints. Rayford is re-united with his wife Irene and son Raymie, and Kenny with Buck and Chloe, along with all the other saved characters who died throughout the series including Ken Ritz, Tsion Ben-Judah and his family, Hattie Durham, Floyd Charles, and others re-uniting in Glorified Bodies as the 75-day interval between the Glorious Appearing and the Millennial Kingdom begins.

== Reception ==
{{Portal|Christianity}}
In the ''[[National Review]]'', the Catholic author [[Carl E. Olson]] described ''Glorious Appearing'' as "400 pages of repetitive, numbing bombast", and said that the [[premillennialism|premillennialist]] [[dispensationalism|dispensationalist]] theology that forms the theological basis for the novels "is rejected, either explicitly or implicitly, by the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, and nearly every major [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denomination". Olson also argues that the plot and details of the Left Behind series are similar to and possibly plagiarised from the Rapture novel ''666'' by [[Salem Kirban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/olson200404020904.asp|title=The 12th Coming of Less-Than-Glorious Fiction|date=2 April 2004|first=Carl E.|last=Olson|publisher=National Review|accessdate=17 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903003148/http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/olson200404020904.asp|archivedate=3 September 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Goodbye, Farewell and Amen''''' is a [[television film]] that served as the 256th and final episode of the American television series ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''. Closing out the series' 11th season, the 2 hour episode first aired on [[CBS]] on February 28, 1983, ending the series' original run. The episode was written by a large number of collaborators, including series star [[Alan Alda]], who also directed. 

The episode's plot chronicles the final days of the [[Korean War]] at the 4077th MASH, and features several storylines intended to show the war's effects on the individual personnel of the unit, and to bring closure to the series.&lt;!--The most notable of these storylines centers around the character of [[Hawkeye Pierce|Captain Benjamin Franklin Hawkeye Pierce]] (Alda), who begins the episode in an [[United States Army|Army]] [[mental hospital]] being treated for a [[nervous breakdown]] by psychiatrist [[Dr. Sidney Freedman|Major Sidney Freedman]] (played by recurring guest star [[Allan Arbus]]).--&gt; After the [[ceasefire]] goes into effect, the members of the 4077th throw a party before taking down the camp for the last time. After tear-filled goodbyes, the main characters go their separate ways, leading to the final scene of the series.

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=December 2009}}
As peace negotiations continue during the Korean War, [[Hawkeye Pierce]] is being treated by [[Sidney Freedman|Dr. Sidney Freedman]] at a mental hospital. Sidney is trying to get Hawkeye to release repressed memories of an outing most of the 4077th staff attended at a beach near [[Incheon]] which appears to have led to a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name="MASH4077couk"&gt;[http://www.mash4077.co.uk/classic/goodbye.html Classic Episode – Goodbye, Farewell and Amen]. MASH4077.co.uk (Accessed November 12, 2006) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109032059/http://www.mash4077.co.uk/classic/goodbye.html |date=November 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkeye first remembers the trip home as having a party-like atmosphere with him calling for a bottle of whiskey to be passed to a person who "can't wait" to drink it. He next recalls that the person in question was actually a soldier who needed the bottle. Eventually he remembers that the bottle did not contain whiskey, but [[blood plasma|plasma]], and the soldier was severely wounded. Hawkeye was actually yelling impatiently that "this guy can't wait".

Further on, Hawkeye recalls that they picked up some refugees and wounded soldiers further up the road as an enemy patrol was coming. The bus had to hide off the road and the occupants were forced to remain quiet. Before Hawkeye tells more, he lashes out at two of his fellow patients for getting into a loud argument. Hawkeye says they were screaming like chickens, and jokes about chickens taking the bus. Using that as a clue, Sidney digs deeper and Hawkeye remembers a refugee woman who was carrying a chicken that would not stop clucking.

Hawkeye insists that he is perfectly fine, but Freedman reminds him that after returning to the 4077th, Hawkeye had accused an [[anesthesiologist]] of trying to smother a patient, and then drove a Jeep through a wall in the officers' club and ordered a double bourbon. After more questioning, Hawkeye remembers telling the refugee to make the chicken be quiet, and then that the woman had killed the chicken to silence it. Hawkeye then breaks down sobbing as he remembers that the refugee woman was not carrying a chicken, but her infant child, and had smothered her baby to death to silence it as Hawkeye had insisted. Hawkeye is initially angry at Sidney for making him remember, but Sidney tells him, "You had to get it out in the open. Now we're halfway home." Hawkeye initially believes he will be sent home to Maine, but after more sessions, Sidney informs him he must go back to the 4077th and promises to check in on him.

Back at the 4077th, the camp is helping to shelter some of the North Korean and Chinese troops surrendering in the final days of the war. [[Charles Emerson Winchester|Charles Winchester]], who is suffering from [[diarrhea]], possibly [[dysentery]], encounters a group of Chinese soldiers on a motorcycle when he is forced to relieve himself in a local creek after the camp's [[latrine]] is destroyed by a runaway tank. The soldiers surrender to him and reveal themselves to be musicians. Winchester brings the soldiers back to camp along with the motorcycle, which [[B.J. Hunnicutt]] decides to take for himself and paint yellow. As Winchester is trying to listen to music ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Clarinet Quintet (Mozart)|Clarinet Quintet in A, K. 581]]), the Chinese musicians annoy him with their own playing. When Winchester tells them to stop, they recognize the name Mozart and one of the musicians begins playing the same piece to which Winchester was listening. An impressed Winchester decides to teach them how to play it properly, eventually forming a bond with the Chinese POWs.

Winchester is also distressed over the future of his career after the end of the war. He tells [[Margaret Houlihan]] that he has applied to be chief of thoracic surgery at Mercy Hospital in Boston, which he regards as "the finest in New England", but has been notified by a friend that another, less surgically qualified, but more politically connected surgeon might get the position, instead. Margaret decides to assist Winchester in his application, as a friend of her father's is the chief of staff at Mercy Hospital. Winchester receives a letter days later that tells him the good news. However, he is told by [[Maxwell Klinger|Klinger]] that Margaret assisted him, and angry that he did not get it through his own efforts, storms off, and is curt and rude to Houlihan.

Klinger has fallen in love with Soon-Lee Han, a local Korean refugee at the camp. Soon-Lee has been searching for her parents, who have gone missing, and has been told they are in [[Chorwon County|Chorwon]] nearby. Chorwon, however, is the site of ongoing fighting and Klinger does not want Soon-Lee going there. Eventually, he finds out that she has left and chases after her, hoping that she will come back. After she initially refuses, he declares his feelings for her and takes her back to camp.

[[B.J. Hunnicutt]] has received discharge papers and is excited about going home to finally see his daughter, Erin, whom he has not seen since she was born. [[Sherman Potter|Col. Potter]] is initially unhappy about being without two of his surgeons as Hawkeye has not yet left the mental hospital. However, the colonel agrees after B.J. tells him that he knows of a surgeon who will take his place.

Almost immediately thereafter, the camp is attacked with [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. Several [[prisoners of war|POWs]], locked in a makeshift pen in the compound, are stuck in the line of fire and [[List of M*A*S*H characters#Father Mulcahy|Father Mulcahy]] goes to let them out. A mortar explodes directly in front of him and knocks him out. B.J. examines Mulcahy and finds that he is suffering from [[tinnitus]] and could potentially lose his hearing. Mulcahy, knowing that deafness could result in him being discharged, demands B.J. keep it a secret from the camp, as he does not want to abandon the local orphans for whom he has been caring.

The mortar attacks continue and Potter, believing it is because of the abandoned tank that destroyed the latrine and remains in the compound, calls [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]] headquarters, demanding answers. He is told that the tank has to stay at the 4077th until the unit to which it belonged comes back and claims it. Klinger decides to help by draping a tent over the tank so the North Koreans will not see it, but it proves only to be a temporary fix, as the enemy knows the tank is still there and continues to attack.

As B.J. is leaving the camp by helicopter, Klinger opens that day's mail and informs Potter that B.J.'s discharge was rescinded. Potter decides to ignore this, telling Klinger to put any mail on his desk and that he will look at it later. Hawkeye returns shortly thereafter to find a new batch of wounded in the camp and that his roommate and best friend has gone home. Potter calls headquarters while operating and asks where the new surgeon is. The mortar attacks on the 4077th resume worse than before. As everyone is pinned down in the operating room (OR), Hawkeye decides to run out to move the tank. He turns it around, before hitting the OR tent, smashing through the newly built latrine, and finally running the tank into the camp garbage dump, deflecting the shelling away from the hospital. Potter is not amused by this and decides that Hawkeye needs to see Sidney again.

That night, an incendiary bomb attack sparks a fire in the nearby forest and the 4077th is in its path, forcing the camp to evacuate and move operations ("bug out"). Once the new camp is set up, Potter's replacement surgeon arrives. To his surprise, it is B.J., who tells Potter that he got about "a third of the way home" before word of his recall to the 4077th got to him in [[Guam]]. He apologizes to Hawkeye for not leaving him a note, as he was so rushed the day he left, but Hawkeye brushes it off.

Sidney arrives at the new camp site in the middle of a celebration, as the 4077th decides to throw a party in absentia for B.J.'s daughter, who is turning two. A two-year-old orphan girl is picked to take the place of Erin Hunnicutt and B.J. is touched. Hawkeye, however, is saddened and walks off. Sidney follows him, telling him that his tank stunt was the most sensible thing to do, that he should not be afraid of his job anymore, that he is overthinking things, and that his failures might make him a better doctor.

A POW exchange takes place later that day, which includes the five Chinese musicians. Winchester tries to keep them with him, but is turned away by a soldier. As the truck taking them leaves, the musicians bid farewell to Winchester by playing the Mozart piece correctly. Moments later, an announcement is relayed to the camp: a [[ceasefire]] has been agreed to and, at 10:00 that evening, the United States' involvement in the Korean War will [[Korean Armistice Agreement|come to an end]]. Almost on cue, a new batch of wounded arrives at the camp. Potter informs the doctors that this is to be the last set of wounded operated on at the new camp, as headquarters has ordered them back to their original site at [[Uijeongbu]].

Once they return, a new batch of wounded arrives at the compound on top of the one they were working on and Winchester is dispatched to perform [[triage]] outside. He discovers that one of the deceased patients is one of the Chinese musicians. Winchester also learns that everyone else in the truck carrying the POWs was killed in an attack. Winchester, still in disbelief, returns to the Swamp and listens to his Mozart record, but after a few seconds, he pulls it out of the player and smashes it to bits in anger.

As he is finished operating, Hawkeye's next patient is a young girl who was apparently wounded in a round of shelling. With Sidney observing, Hawkeye hesitates in performing the operation. Although Potter offers to switch with him, Hawkeye decides to operate on the little girl himself. With Hawkeye now apparently back to normal, Sidney decides to depart the 4077th for the last time and Hawkeye thanks him for his treatment. As Sidney leaves, he echoes a statement he made to the doctors in one of his first visits years earlier: "Ladies and gentlemen, take my advice. Pull down your pants and slide on the ice." Once Sidney is out of the OR, the announcement of the ceasefire and the end of the shelling comes over the radio. The doctors pause in wonder at the new peace, then continue operating on the remaining wounded.

The camp spends its last night together at a party in the mess tent. Colonel Potter decides to have everyone talk about what they will be doing after the war. Potter is heading home to his wife Mildred in [[Hannibal, Missouri]], where he will still practice medicine part-time. Hawkeye says that he originally wanted to work in a city hospital, but instead everything that has happened to him has changed his mind and that he plans to open a practice in his hometown of Crabapple Cove, Maine. B.J. jokes that he has run off with somebody at the airport bar in Guam, but is really headed back to San Francisco to be reunited with his family. Winchester tells the camp of his new position at Mercy Hospital, but because of the deaths of the Chinese musicians he helped teach, the music that he loved and sought out as a refuge is to remain a reminder of the horrors of war. Margaret was offered two positions abroad through her father's influence, but has decided to refuse them and take a job in America working in a hospital. Mulcahy has decided to begin working with the deaf and hard-of-hearing, having been inspired by his accident. Klinger surprises everyone by announcing that, after years of trying to receive a [[Section 8 (military)|section-eight]] discharge and go home, he is staying in Korea to marry Soon-Lee, who will not leave the country until she finds her parents.

The next morning, Father Mulcahy presides over Klinger and Soon-Lee's wedding with Potter as the [[best man]] and Margaret as the [[matron of honor]]. After the wedding, the camp starts to be disassembled and various members remove their hometown signs from the camp signpost. Father Mulcahy leaves for the 8063rd, with B.J. continuing to protect the secret of Mulcahy's hearing loss until the time he leaves. Winchester and Margaret are to leave in the same jeep, but Winchester cannot get on because it is overloaded with Margaret's belongings. Margaret, still upset at Winchester for his ingratitude, decides to disembark, but Winchester tells her to stay and orders [[List of M*A*S*H characters#Luther Rizzo|Sgt. Rizzo]] to find him another ride. Winchester makes peace with Margaret and allows her to keep one of his treasured poetry books. She then says goodbye to B.J., Potter, and Hawkeye, who gives her a long, passionate kiss.

After Margaret leaves, the Swamp is struck down as its occupants sarcastically mock its demise. Winchester leaves in a garbage truck, the last vehicle Rizzo has, but not before telling Potter that he hopes to guide his charges in the way Potter guided him and the rest of the camp. He then bids farewell to his tentmates, telling Hawkeye and B.J. that they showed him "what going home is all about". Winchester then boards the garbage truck, commenting, "what better way to leave a garbage dump", and leaves.

The next to leave is the colonel, who rides out of camp one last time on his beloved horse Sophie. Once he reaches the 8063rd, he boards a waiting jeep to head towards his flight home, and donates Sophie to the orphanage for the children. Before he goes, he tells B.J. and Hawkeye that he was glad that they all worked together and that he will miss the good laughs they all shared, appreciating them because Hawkeye and B.J. always managed to give him joy when he needed it the most. After Potter climbs onto Sophie, Hawkeye and B.J. offer Potter a salute in appreciation of him. The colonel rides off into the distance, leaving the two Swampmates as the last people at the camp.

A chopper then arrives at the helipad to take Hawkeye to his next stop. B.J. offers him a ride on the motorcycle he claimed from the Chinese musicians and takes him up the hill to the helipad. While there, Hawkeye and B.J. have one final conversation. Hawkeye says that he will never be able to "shake" B.J., and the two tell each other that things at home will remind them of each other. The two embrace and say they will miss each other, and Hawkeye boards the chopper.

Earlier, Hawkeye had been irritated with B.J. for his apparent inability to say "goodbye" as the two would probably never see each other again. Just before B.J. rides off for the last time, he says to Hawkeye that though he will try to find him once they get back to the states, he left Hawkeye a note just in case. The chopper takes off and as it gains altitude, Hawkeye sees that B.J. has arranged a large number of stones to read "GOODBYE" on the helipad. Upon seeing that, he smiles, knowing that B.J. was capable of saying goodbye after all, and the chopper flies away from what is left of the 4077th for the last time. The original theme song "[[Suicide Is Painless]]" (from the 1970 film) is then played in its entirety.

==Cultural reaction and impact==
The anticipation before the airing of ''Goodbye, Farewell and Amen'' was almost unprecedented, especially for a regular television series (in contrast to awards shows, sporting events, or special events). Interest from advertisers prompted CBS, the network broadcasting ''M*A*S*H'', to sell 30-second commercial blocks for $450,000 (equal to ${{Inflation|US|450000|1983|fmt=c}} today) each—costlier than even for [[NBC]]'s airing of the [[Super Bowl XVII|Super Bowl of that year]].&lt;ref name=watch&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CMPx-jksa6IC|title=Watching M*A*S*H, Watching America |last=Wittebols|first=James H. |authorlink=James H.

On the night the episode aired, large areas of California (particularly the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]) suffered power outages due to unusually stormy winter weather, which prevented many viewers from watching the series finale. Three weeks later, on March 21, [[KPIX-TV|KPIX]], the CBS affiliate in San Francisco, reaired the episode.{{fact|date=August 2017}}

===Reaction and aftermath===
In the United States, the episode drew 105.97&amp;nbsp;million total viewers&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt; and a total audience of 121.6&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metvnetwork.com/shows/m-a-s-h|title=M*A*S*H Did You Know?|publisher=MeTV|accessdate=June 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than both Super Bowl XVII and the ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' miniseries.  The episode surpassed the single-episode [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] record that had been set by the ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' episode that [[Who Done It (Dallas)|resolved the "Who Shot J.R.?" cliffhanger]]. From 1983 until 2010, ''Goodbye, Farewell and Amen'' remained the [[List of most watched television broadcasts|most watched television broadcast]] in American history,&lt;ref name=watch/&gt; passed only in total viewership (but not in ratings or share) in February 2010 by [[Super Bowl XLIV]].

As ''M*A*S*H'' was one of the most successful shows in TV history, in order not to completely lose the franchise, CBS quickly created a new series, ''[[AfterMASH]]'', that followed the postwar adventures of Colonel Potter, Max Klinger, and Father Mulcahy in a stateside hospital. Despite wide popularity in its premiere episodes, script problems and constant character changes led to a sharp decline in viewers, and the show was cancelled by CBS after only two seasons.  Another would be spin-off, ''[[W*A*L*T*E*R]]'', was a pilot made in 1984 that was never picked up. It starred Gary Burghoff, who reprised his ''M*A*S*H'' character.

''Goodbye, Farewell and Amen'' was not initially included in the [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] package for ''M*A*S*H'''s final season. However, in 1992, the episode made its syndication premiere in time for its 10th anniversary. Local stations aired it as a part of a ''Movie of the Week''.{{fact|date=June 2016}}

When ''M*A*S*H'' was shown on [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] and [[Hallmark Channel]], they aired ''Goodbye, Farewell and Amen'' occasionally. Hallmark Channel showed it twice a year, February and August, before dropping ''M*A*S*H'' from its schedule. [[TV Land]] and [[Me-TV|MeTV]] have also shown the episode sporadically, including a Veterans Day broadcast on November 11, 2015.  In Canada, the cable channel History Television shows the episode in its entirety annually on the Labor Day holiday.

In 2011, the [[TV Guide Network]] special ''TV's Most Unforgettable Finales'' ranked this finale as the best.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

[[File:Heckler2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A heckler in Washington, D.C. leans across a police line toward a demonstration of [[Iran]]ians during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], August 1980]]

A '''heckler''' is a person who harasses and tries to disconcert others with questions, challenges, or gibes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heckler |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heckler |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hecklers are often known to shout disparaging comments at a performance or event, or to interrupt set-piece speeches, with the intent of disturbing performers and/or participants.

==Origin==
Although the word ''heckler'', which originated from the textile trade, was first attested in the mid-15th century, the sense "person who harasses" was from 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heckler|title=heckler {{!}} Origin and history of heckler by Online Etymology Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ''heckle'' was to tease or comb out [[flax]] or [[hemp]] fibres. The additional meaning, to interrupt speakers with awkward or embarrassing questions, was added in [[Scotland]], and specifically perhaps in early nineteenth century [[Dundee]], a famously radical town where the hecklers who combed the flax had established a reputation as the most radical and belligerent element in the workforce. In the heckling factory, one heckler would read out the day's news while the others worked, to the accompaniment of interruptions and furious debate.&lt;ref name=McKie&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/28/broadcasting.comment |title=Unplotted ripostes |last1=McKie |first1=David |date=28 April 2005 |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heckling was a major part of the [[vaudeville]] theater. Sometimes it was incorporated into the play. [[Milton Berle]]'s weekly TV variety series in the 1960s featured a heckler named Sidney Spritzer ([[German language|German]]/[[Yiddish]] for 'squirter') played by [[Borscht Belt]] comic [[Irving Benson]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''[[Muppet Show|The Muppet Show]]'', which was also built around a vaudeville theme, featured two hecklers, [[Statler &amp; Waldorf]] (two old men named after famous hotels). Heckles are now particularly likely to be heard at comedy performances, to unsettle or compete with the performer.

==Politics==

&lt;!-- 
NOTE: these sections could stand to be organized a bit more (by year, era, whatever)
with sub-headers (or at least date or year) for each "incident" so as to put them all in context.
--&gt;
Politicians speaking before live audiences have less latitude to deal with hecklers. Legally, such conduct may constitute protected [[free speech]]. Strategically, coarse or belittling retorts to hecklers entail personal risk disproportionate to any gain. Some politicians, however, have been known to improvise a relevant and witty response despite these pitfalls. One acknowledged expert at this was [[Harold Wilson]], British Prime Minister in the 1960s:

:'''Heckler''': (''interrupting a passage in a Wilson speech about Labour's spending plans'') What about [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]?
:'''Wilson''': The government has no plans to increase public expenditure in Vietnam.
:'''Heckler''': Rubbish!
:'''Wilson''': I'll come to your special interest in a minute, sir.&lt;ref name=McKie/&gt;

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]]'s [[I Have a Dream]] speech was largely a response to supporter [[Mahalia Jackson]] interrupting his prepared speech to shout "Tell them about the dream, Martin". &lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, Hayden of heckla.com (16th April 2018) : Former Martin Luther King, Jr. adviser and speechwriter Clarence B. Jones talks to WSJ's Monika Vosough about how Martin Luther King's favorite gospel singer Mahalia Jackson helped create the "I Have a Dream" speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlOlynG6FY&amp;ab_channel=WallStreetJournal&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, King stopped reading from his previously prepared speech and improvised the remainder of the speech - this improvised portion of the speech is the best-known part of the speech and frequently rated as one of the best of all time.

During a campaign stop just before winning the Presidency in 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] was heckled by an audience member who kept interrupting him during a speech. Reagan tried to go on with his speech three times, but after being interrupted yet again glared at the heckler and snapped "Aw, shut up!" The audience immediately gave him a standing ovation.

In 1992, then-Presidential candidate [[Bill Clinton]] was interrupted by Bob Rafsky, a member of the AIDS activism group [[ACT UP]], who accused him of "dying of ambition to be president"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toner |first=Robin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/us/the-1992-campaign-aids-protester-provokes-clinton-s-anger.html |title=NY Times |work=New York Times |date=27 March 1992 |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a rally. After becoming visibly agitated, Clinton took the microphone off the stand, pointed to the heckler and directly responded to him by saying, "[...] I have treated you and all of the other people who have interrupted my rallies with a hell of a lot more respect than you treated me. And it's time to start thinking about that!" Clinton was then met with raucous applause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=30 maart 2006 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGTQZnC-6a4 |title=Clinton's Angry Response to Heckler |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Audience control ===
&lt;!-- 
NOTE: possible use for subheader here, distinguishing the use of "audience screening" as a means of discouraging political heckling.
NOTE: 'astroturfing' and 'audience screening' are arguably distinct, changed to a 'see also'
--&gt;
&lt;!-- What? --&gt;
One modern political approach to discourage heckling is to ensure that major events are given before a "tame" audience of sympathizers, or conducted to allow restrictions on who may remain on the premises (see also, ''[[astroturfing]]''). The downside is this may make heckling incidents even more newsworthy. This happened to [[Tony Blair]] during a [[photo op]] visit to a hospital during the 2001 general election campaign, and again in 2003 during a speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2690549.stm "Blair's heckler states his case"], BBC, 24 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, American Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] was interrupted mid-speech by Perry Patterson, a middle-aged mother in a pre-screened rally audience. After various supportive outbursts that were permitted ("Four more years", "Go Bush!"), Patterson uttered  "No, no, no, no" and was removed from the speech area and told to leave. She refused, and was arrested for criminal [[trespass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/02/09/coverstory.html |title=Woman utters No |publisher=Eugeneweekly.com |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in 2005, Cheney received some heckling that was broadcast during his trip to New Orleans, after [[Hurricane Katrina]] ravaged the area. The heckling occurred during a press conference in [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], Mississippi, in an area that was cordoned off for public safety reasons, and then further secured for the press conference. Nevertheless, emergency room physician Ben Marble got close enough to the proceedings and could be heard yelling, "Go fuck yourself, Mr. Cheney." Cheney laughed it off and continued speaking.&lt;ref&gt;June Deery: ''Consuming Reality: The Commercialization of Factual Entertainment''.  MacMillan, 2012.  Page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  The heckle was a reference to Cheney's use of the phrase the previous year, when during a heated exchange with Senator [[Patrick Leahy|Patrick Joseph Leahy]], Vermont, he said "fuck yourself" on the floor of the senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheney Dismisses Critic With Obscenity|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3699-2004Jun24.html|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2005, ''[[The Scotsman]]'' reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2094782005 |title=Iran denies troop attack links |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513220441/http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2094782005 |archivedate=13 May 2007 |work=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Iranian ambassador Dr Seyed Mohammed Hossein Adeli... speaking at the annual Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament conference...  During his speech to the CND several people were told to leave the room following protests at Iran's human rights record. Several protesters shouted "Fascists" at the ambassador and the organisers of the conference. Walter Wolfgang, the 82-year-old peace campaigner who was forced out of the Labour Party conference last month, was in the audience."

Since 2005 heckling of performing artists has become more commonplace in [[Switzerland]].  Musicians of [[Basel]] and [[Zurich]] have become an increasing focus of hecklers.  This shift is primarily perpetrated by foreigners and is often met with a positive response by the non-Swiss performers who welcome the audience interaction. 

On Thursday, 20 April 2006, a heckler from the [[Falun Gong]] spiritual movement entered the US [[White House]] grounds as a reporter and interrupted a formal arrival ceremony for [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Hu Jintao]].  Moments into Mr Hu's speech at the event, [[Wang Wenyi]], perched on the top tier of the stands reserved for the press, began screaming in English and Chinese: "President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] stop him. Stop this visit. Stop the killing and torture."&lt;!--  The heckler was allowed to continue for several minutes despite the heavy presence of security personnel typical of such high level meeting of officials, prompting speculation that the incident was planned with the tacit cooperation of the White House in order to embarrass the Chinese president, hence possibly making this heckling incident one which was found justified by its audience. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html "No breakthrough in US, China talks"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011756/http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Bush later apologised to his guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1758305,00.html |title=Protester gatecrashes Hu visit as China and US fail to make progress |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 21 April 2006|accessdate=12 March 2009  | first=Suzanne | last=Goldenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2009, Representative [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]] (R-SC) shouted "You lie!" at President [[Barack Obama]] after President Obama stated that his health care plan would not subsidize coverage for illegal immigrants during a [[Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2009|speech]] he was making to a joint session of Congress.  Wilson later apologized for his outburst.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/09/09/wilson-apologizes-i-let-my-emotions-get-the-best-of-me/ "Wilson apologizes: 'I let my emotions get the best of me'"]. Retrieved September 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November 2013, Ju Hong, a 24-year-old South Korean immigrant without legal documentation, shouted at Obama to use his executive power to stop deportation of illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inagist.com/all/405077610499022849/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203164254/http://inagist.com/all/405077610499022849/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama said "If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so." "But we're also a nation of laws, that's part of our tradition," he continued. "And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/immigrationdebate/ci_24598028/obama-san-francisco-calls-immigration-reform|title=Obama’s immigration speech in deep-blue San Francisco interrupted by anti-deportation hecklers|author=|date=25 November 2013|website=mercurynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/heckler-obama-steals-attention-presidents-speech-21008837|title=Video: Heckler Disrupts Obama's Speech With Minute-Long Rant|first=ABC|last=News|date=|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb4qQ/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126145922/http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb4qQ/ |archivedate=26 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/|title=Obama addresses heckler during speech on immigration|author=|date=|website=daytondailynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402144614/http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
Hecklers can also appear at sporting events, and usually (but not always) direct their taunts at a visiting team. Fans of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] [[American football]] team are notorious for heckling; among the most infamous incidents were [[booing]] and subsequently throwing snowballs at a performer dressed as [[Santa Claus]] in a halftime show in 1968, and cheering at the career-ending injury of visiting team player [[Michael Irvin]] in 1999.  Often, sports heckling will also involve throwing objects onto the field; this has led most sports stadiums to ban glass containers and bottlecaps. Another famous heckler is [[Robert Szasz]], who regularly attends [[Tampa Bay Rays]] baseball games and is known for loudly heckling one opposing player per game or series. Former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[association football|football]] star [[Dejan Savićević]] is involved in an infamous incident with a heckler in which during an interview, a man on the street is heard shouting off-camera: "You're a piece of shit!"  Dejan berated the man, and went on to finish the interview, without missing a beat.

In English and Scottish [[association football|football]], heckling and swearing from the stands, and [[football chant]]s such as [[who ate all the pies?]] are common.

Australian sporting audiences are known for creative heckling. Perhaps the most famous is [[Yabba]] who had a grandstand at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] named after him, and now a statue.

The sport of [[cricket]] is particularly notorious for heckling between the teams themselves, which is known as [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]].

At the NBA Drafts of recent years, many fans have gone with heckling [[ESPN]] [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] analyst and host of, [[Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith]], [[Stephen A. Smith]]. Most notably, The Stephen A. Smith Heckling Society of Gentlemen heckles him with a sock puppet dubbed as Stephen A. himself.

Tennis fans are also fairly noted for heckling. Some may call out during a service point to distract either player. Another common heckle from tennis fans is cheering after a service fault, which is considered to be rude and unsporting.

In 2009, then [[Toronto Blue Jays]] outfielder [[Alex Ríos]] was a victim of a heckling incident outside after a fund-raising event. The incident occurred after Rios declined to sign an autograph for a young fan, the same day he went 0 for 5 with 5 [[strikeouts]] in a game against the [[Los Angeles Angels]]. An older man yelled "The way you played today Alex, you should be lucky someone wants your autograph." Rios then replied with "Who gives a fuck", repeating it until being ushered into a vehicle. Rios did apologize the next day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/story/2009/06/05/sp-rios-youtube.html | work=CBC News | title=Rios apologizes for YouTube tirade at abusive fan | date=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was eventually placed on waivers and claimed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] later that year.

==Music==
{{Further|Electric Dylan controversy}}
One of the most famous heckles in music history occurred at a [[Bob Dylan]] concert at the [[Manchester Free Trade Hall]] in 1966. During a quiet moment in between songs, an audience member shouts very loudly and clearly, "Judas!" referencing Dylan's so-called betrayal of folk music by "going electric". Dylan replied: "I don't believe you, you're a liar!" before telling his band to "Play it fucking loud!" They play an acidic version of "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glover|first=Tony|title=Bob Dylan Live 1966 Liner Notes|publisher=Columbia Records|year=1998|location=New York|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was captured on tape and the full concert was released as volume four of Dylan's ''Live Bootleg Series''.

==Comedy==
Heckling often occurs during [[stand up comedy]] performances, particularly at [[Renegade_show|open stage]] performances, and/or where alcoholic beverages are being consumed. It is regarded as a sign of audience members becoming impatient with what they regard as a low quality performance. Some comedians ignore the heckling and dislike the practice. In an interview for a 2011 BBC documentary, [[Billy Connolly]] said that "I loathe hecklers. I haven't one good syllable to say about hecklers. When you've come out of the club circuit and all that and you're in the concert hall...they should be gone."&lt;ref&gt;BBC Imagine: The Art of Stand Up, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other stand-up comedians devise a strategy for quashing such outbursts, usually by having a store of retorts (known as "squelches") on hand. The idea is to get the audience laughing at the heckler for being outwitted.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Andrew. [http://www.juggling.org/~conway/juggler/MAL.TXT "You're Ugly, Your Dick Is Small, and Everybody Fucks Your Mother—The Stand-Up Comedian's Response to the Heckler"]. ''[[Maledicta]]'' Vol. 11, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, live comedy venues tend to discourage heckling via signage and admissions policy, but tend to tolerate it as it creates customer loyalty. The etiquette of exactly how much heckling is tolerated differs immensely from venue to venue, however, but is generally more likely to be tolerated in blue collar or working class venues. Some cities feature 'heckle nights' where heckling is actively encouraged.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The comedy TV series ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' featured a pair of hecklers named [[Statler and Waldorf]]. These characters created a kind of meta-comedy act in which the show's official comedian, [[Fozzie Bear]], acted as their usual [[Double act|foil]], although they occasionally made jokes at other characters as well.

Another notable use of heckling in comedy is in the cult favorite series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The series involves a man (either Joel Robinson or Mike Nelson) and two robots (Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot) sitting in a theater mocking bad B-movies. This style of comedy, coined as riffing, is continued with commentary-based series such as [[Rifftrax]] and [[Cinematic Titanic]].

In one of [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s plays "The School Master", a heckler interrupted his play by shouting "Here!" after Atkinson had read out an amusing name on his register. Atkinson incorporated it into his act by saying "I have a detention book..."{{cn|date=October 2017}}

[[File:2htmcc poster.jpg|thumb|250px|Poster art for the 1st Annual High Times Medical Cannabis Cup, 2010]]

The ''[[High Times]]'' '''Medical Cannabis Cup''' is an annual event celebrating medical marijuana. The first Medical Cannabis Cup took place in [[San Francisco]], California June 19–20, 2010. 

Like the ''High Times'' [[Cannabis Cup]] in Amsterdam, many marijuana strains are judged and Cups (trophies) are awarded in a number of categories at the Medical Cup. However, unlike the Cannabis Cup, the Medical Cannabis Cup focuses on the emerging medical marijuana movement in America. As a result, official judging of the strains and edibles is left to a panel of experts. Attendees receive a list of participating medical [[marijuana dispensaries]] and state approved medical cannabis patients can visit those [[marijuana dispensaries]] and sample the entered strains prior to the event. 

In addition to awarding the best and most medicinal marijuana, hash and edibles from legal medical [[marijuana dispensaries]], the event also includes medical cultivation seminars, a product expo and information on creating a legal “cann-business.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16602">'''Anti-Spanish sentiment''' or '''Hispanophobia'''  (from [[Latin]] ''Hispanus'', "Spaniard" and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] φοβία (''[[phobia]]''), "fear") is a [[fear]], [[distrust]], [[wikt:Special:Search/aversion|aversion]], hatred, or [[discrimination]] against [[Hispanic]] people, [[Hispanic culture]] and the [[Spanish language]]. Its opposite is [[Hispanophilia]]. This historical phenomenon has had three main stages, originating in 16th-century [[Europe]], reawakening during 19th-century disputes over Spanish and [[history of Mexico|Mexican]] territory such as the [[Spanish–American War|Spanish–American]] and [[Mexican–American War]]s, and finally in tandem with politically charged controversies such as [[bilingual education]] and [[illegal immigration to the United States]]. Within the complex identity politics of Spain, Catalan, Basque, Galician nationalism has also been identified with hispanophobic views and discourse.

==History==
{{Discrimination sidebar}}

===The Black Legend===
{{main |Black Legend}}
Early instances of Hispanophobia arose as the influence of the [[Spanish Empire]] and [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] spread through [[Late Middle Ages|late-medieval]] Europe. During this period Hispanophobia materialized in [[folklore]] sometimes referred to as the [[Black Legend]]:
{{quote|The legend first arose amid the religious strife and imperial rivalries of 16th-century Europe. [[Northern European]]s, who loathed [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Spain]] and envied its [[Americas|American]] empire, published books and gory engravings that depicted Spanish [[colonization]] as uniquely barbarous: an orgy of greed, slaughter and papist depravity, the Inquisition writ large.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/09/opinion/09horwitz.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=576beb4a7ead76f2&amp;ex=1310097600&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss "Immigration — and the Curse of the Black Legend." Tony Horwitz. ''New York Times'' 9 July 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
''La leyenda negra'', as Spanish historians first named it, entailed a view of Spaniards as "unusually cruel, avaricious, treacherous, fanatical, superstitious, hot-blooded, corrupt, decadent, indolent, and authoritarian". As Spain and England colonized the Americas, "[t]he Black Legend informed Anglo Americans' judgments about the political, economic, religious, and social forces that had shaped the Spanish provinces from Florida to California, as well as throughout the hemisphere".&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;[https://www.jstor.org.www2.lib.ku.edu:2048/cgi-bin/jstor/printpage/00433810/ap030088/03a00010?backcontext=results&amp;action=download&amp;backurl=http://www.jstor.org/search/BasicResults?hp=25&amp;si=1&amp;gw=jtx&amp;jtxsi=1&amp;jcpsi=1&amp;artsi=1&amp;Query=hispanophobia&amp;wc=on "The Spanish Legacy in North America and the Historical Imagination." David J. Weber. ''The Western Historical Quarterly,'' Vol. 23, No. 1. (Feb., 1992), pp. 4–24.]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These judgments were handed down from Europeans who saw the Spaniards as inferior to other European cultures.&lt;ref name="Humanities Full Text"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amago|first=Samuel|journal=Film Criticism|year=2005|volume=30|issue=1|pages=41–63|title=Why Spaniards make good bad guys: Sergi Lopez and the persistence of the black legend in contemporary European cinema}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus in [[North America]], Hispanophobia preceded the United States' [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] by almost two hundred years.  Historians theorize that the [[History of England|English]] and the [[History of the Netherlands|Dutch]] employed and encouraged it as part of their efforts to undermine the Spanish Empire; early [[New England]]ers engaged in Hispanophobic efforts to assimilate Spanish colonies:
{{quote|[I]n North America a deep current of Hispanophobia pervades Anglo-Saxon culture. ... As early as the late seventeenth century, we find [[Puritan]] divines like [[Cotton Mather]] and Samuel Sewell studying Spanish—with a view to winning converts to their version of Protestantism. Sewell spoke of "bombing [[sic|[sic]]] [[Santo Domingo]], [[Havana]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Mexico]] itself" with the [[Spanish translations of the Bible|Spanish Bible]], and Cotton Mather even wrote a book on Protestant doctrine in Spanish, published in Boston in 1699, intended for—as he might say—the darker regions of Spanish America.&lt;ref name=Falcoff&gt;[http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.17613/pub_detail.asp "Beyond Bilingualism." Mark Falcoff, American Enterprise Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711103542/http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.17613/pub_detail.asp |date=2007-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==={{anchor|United States}}In the United States===
{{Main|Anti-Mexican sentiment}}

During the early 20th century, Anglo-Americans in the United States used [[eugenics]] as a basis for their hispanophobia. With the help of the [[eugenics]], C.M. Goethe aided with the transfer of hispanophobia to politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alienated Citizens: "Hispanobobia" and the Mexican Im/Migrant Body|last=Jurado Chair|first=Kathh|publisher=ProQuest|year=2008|isbn=|location=Michigan|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Another circumstance," according to historian [[David J. Weber]], "that shaped the depth of [[English-American|Anglo Americans]]' hispanophobia was the degree to which they saw [[Hispanic]]s as an obstacle to their ambitions".&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt;  As the U.S. grew into a [[republic]], anti-Spanish sentiment exhibited a [[recrudescence]]. Spain was perceived as the antithesis of [[separation of church and state]] and as a paragon of [[monarchy]] and [[colonialism]]; this apparently fundamental opposition to the United States' founding principles fueled hostility that would eventually culminate in the Spanish–American War of 1898.&lt;ref name=Falcoff /&gt; Hispanophobia is particularly evident in the [[historiography]] of the [[Texas Revolution]]:
{{quote|In essence, the Texas rebellion had been little more than a struggle for political and economic power, but early [[Texas]] historians elevated the revolt against Mexico to a 'sublime collision of moral influences', a 'moral struggle,' and 'a war for principles'. ... Hispanophobia, with its particularly vitriolic anti-Mexican variant, also served as a convenient rationale to keep [[Mexicans]] 'in their place.'&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt;}}

Throughout the 20th century, an array of mostly political and economic forces have driven [[immigration]] from a multitude of Spanish-speaking countries—such as [[Cuba]], [[Guatemala]], [[Dominican Republic]], and [[Mexico]]—to the relatively strong economy and stable political environment of the United States. As a result, according to some historians, Americans "now have something called a '[[Hispanic]],' which describes not someone born in a Spanish-speaking country, nor someone who speaks Spanish well or badly, nor even someone with a Hispanic surname, but someone who [[Identity politics|identifies]] himself as such".&lt;ref name=Falcoff /&gt; As key corollary to this development, it is toward this group, which is not precisely or rigorously defined, that U.S. hispanophobia is now predominantly oriented. Many forms of hispanophobia endemic to the Texas Revolution still flourish in the United States today.&lt;ref name=Weber /&gt;

==Contemporary forms of hispanophobia in the United States==

==="Official English"===
Sociologists cite the "Official English" or [[English-only movement]], together with hispanophobic jokes and discourse, as a prominent example of modern-day hispanophobia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=2457295 "The Hispanophobia of the Official English movement in the US." A.C. Zentella. ''International journal of the sociology of language'' 1997, no 127 (1 p.1/4), pp. 71–86]&lt;/ref&gt;
The "[[English-only movement|Official English movement]]" has been criticized because its mass appeal is not as relating to any measurable benefit that would result from the eradication of [[bilingual education]] and other bilingual services. Rather, its appeal results from the fact that "challenges to the status of one's language typically engage deep-seated feelings about national identity and group worth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/448703 "The 'Official English' Movement and the Symbolic Politics of Language in the United States." Jack Citrin, Beth Reingold, Evelyn Walters, Donald P. Green ''The Western Political Quarterly'', Vol. 43, No. 3 (Sep., 1990), pp. 535–559]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this view point out that the English-only movement attracts public support primarily by functioning as a hispanophobic form of intimidation.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Immigration controversy===
[[Image:May Day Immigration March LA66.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[2006 United States immigration reform protests|May Day Immigration March]]  ]]
Citing groups such as the [[Minuteman Project]], sociologists have concluded that some anti-illegal-immigration arguments in the United States have been tainted with [[xenophobia]] and hispanophobia, many of them drawing on concepts of [[racial purity]] and [[eugenics]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} These groups' concern with illegal immigration, they assert, "lies not in immigration per se., which has declined in the last decade, but in the changing national origin of new immigrants, that is immigrants are now mainly Latin American or Asian, which is seen as a threat to the [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|Anglo-Saxon]] tradition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mcb/031/1998/00000018/00000005/art00002 " Biological categories and border controls: the revival of eugenics in anti-immigration rhetoric." ''International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy'' Volume 18, Number 56, 1998, pp. 35–63(29)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001162737/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mcb/031/1998/00000018/00000005/art00002 |date=October 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Arizona Attorney General [[Terry Goddard]] and U.S. Attorney [[Paul K. Charlton|Paul Charlton]] sent a letter of complaint to [[Federal Communications Commission]] chairman [[Kevin Martin (FCC)|Kevin Martin]], in response to the following comments made by radio host Brian James:
{{quote|We'll call it 'Immigration Roulette,' What we'll do is randomly pick one night every week where we will kill whoever crosses the border. Step over there and you die. You get to decide whether it's your lucky night or not. I think that would be more fun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kvoa.com/Global/story.asp?S=4744652 "Officials: Radio host's call to kill border crossers dangerous." Associated Press ©2006.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221617/http://kvoa.com/Global/story.asp?S=4744652 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Calling the speech "dangerous and totally irresponsible for anyone, particularly a licensed body using public airways", Goddard and Charlton expressed concern that it would lead to violence in the state, where conflict over illegal immigration was growing increasingly heated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2006-04-11/us/tuesday_1_illegal-immigration-immigration-reform-bill-passengers/2?_s=PM:US CNN: "Radio host dismisses his call to shoot illegal immigrants as 'satirical'"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207153733/http://articles.cnn.com/2006-04-11/us/tuesday_1_illegal-immigration-immigration-reform-bill-passengers/2?_s=PM:US |date=2012-02-07 }} April 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The radio host said the remarks were "satirical"; the radio station, KFYI, indicated that James was trying out for a regular position on the station and was not an employee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/04/11/tuesday/index.html CNN: "Radio host dismisses his call to shoot illegal immigrants as 'satirical'"] April 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Jersey]] internet radio host, white supremacist, and convicted felon [[Hal Turner]] who used to broadcast out of his house made similar remarks, a number of which the [[Anti-Defamation League]] has posted under the category of [[extremism]]. On April 1, 2006, Turner said:
{{quote|These filthy, disease ridden, two-legged bags of human debris are too stupid to believe....Just think, America, if we bring enough of them here, they can do for America exactly what they did for Mexico! Turn our whole country into a crime-ridden, drug infested slum....These people are sub-human. I would love it if folks who do have such weapons, used them on the crowds on April 10 [at [[2006 United States immigration reform protests|immigration rallies]]]. I advocate machine gunning these invaders to death at their rallies!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/main_Extremism/turner_own_words.htm Anti-Defamation League] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602111003/http://www.adl.org/main_Extremism/turner_own_words.htm |date=2006-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40064">'''Human–animal communication''' is the communication observed between humans and other animals, from non-verbal cues and vocalizations through to the use of language.

==Introduction==
Human–animal communication may be observed in everyday life. The interactions between pets and their owners, for example, reflect a form of spoken, while not necessarily verbal dialogue. A dog being scolded is able to grasp the message by interpreting cues such as the owner's stance, tone of voice, and [[body language]].  This communication is two-way, as owners can learn to discern the subtle differences between barks and meows, and there is a clear difference between the bark of an angry dog defending its home and the happy bark of the same animal while playing. Communication (often nonverbal) is also significant in [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] activities such as [[dressage]].

One scientific study has found that 30 bird species and 29 mammal species share the same pattern of pitch and speed in basic messages, so humans and those 59 species can understand each other when they express "aggression, hostility, appeasement, approachability, submission and fear.&lt;ref name="owings"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Animal vocal communication : a new approach |last=Morton, Eugene |first=and Donald Henry Owings |date=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521324688 |location=Cambridge |oclc=37239014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="friend"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Animal talk : breaking the codes of animal language |last=Friend |first=Tim |date=2004 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=0743201574 |location=New York |pages=90 |oclc=53144532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birds==
[[Parrot]]s are able to use words meaningfully in linguistic tasks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071215082122/http://www.nserc.ca/news/features/parrot_e.htm Parrot Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the [[grey parrot]] [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]] learned 100 words,&lt;ref name="carey"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/science/10cnd-parrot.html |title=Alex, a Parrot Who Had a Way With Words, Dies |last=Carey |first=Benedict |date=2007-09-10 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2018-02-23 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after training used English words to answer questions about color, shapes, size and numbers correctly about 80% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ask the Scientists: Irene Pepperberg Q&amp;A |url=https://www.pbs.org/safarchive/3_ask/archive/qna/3293_pepperberg.html |accessdate=11 September 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071018070320/http://www.pbs.org/safarchive/3_ask/archive/qna/3293_pepperberg.html |archivedate=18 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chimpanzees can make at least 32 sounds with distinct meanings for humans.&lt;ref name="scott" /&gt;

Chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans have used sign language, physical tokens, keyboards and touch screens to communicate with humans in numerous research studies. The research showed that they understood multiple signals and produced them to communicate with humans. There is some disagreement whether they can re-order them to create distinct meanings.

Baboons can learn to recognize an average of 139 4-letter English words (maximum of 308), though they were not taught any meanings to associate with the words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grainger |first=Jonathan |last2=Dufau |first2=Stéphane |last3=Montant |first3=Marie |last4=Ziegler |first4=Johannes C. |last5=Fagot |first5=Joël |date=2012-04-13 |title=Orthographic Processing in Baboons (Papio papio) |url=http://gsite.univ-provence.fr/gsite/Local/lpc/dir/user-556/Science-2012-Grainger-245-8.pdf |journal=Science |language=en |volume=336 |issue=6078 |pages=245–248 |doi=10.1126/science.1218152 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=22499949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no pattern of selections by genre, and the researchers did not look for other [[Music Genome Project|attributes]] which were shared by the orangutans' chosen segments. No comparison was available of how many 30-second segments humans would repeat in the same situation. In another experiment the orangutans did not distinguish between music played in its original order and music sliced into half-second intervals which were played in random order. Chimpanzees can hear higher frequencies than humans; if orangutans can too, and if these overtones are present in the recordings, the overtones would affect their choices.&lt;ref name="ritvo" /&gt;

==Cetaceans==

====Lilly====

In the 1960s, [[John C. Lilly]] sponsored English lessons for one [[bottlenose dolphin]] (''[[Tursiops truncatus]]''). The teacher, [[Margaret Howe Lovatt]], lived with the dolphin for {{frac|2|1|2}} months in a house on the shore of the [[Virgin Islands]]. The house was partially flooded and allowed them to be together for meals, play, language lessons, and sleep.&lt;ref name="lillymind"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The mind of the dolphin : a nonhuman intelligence |last=Lilly |first=John Cunningham |publisher=Doubleday |year=1967 |isbn=0385025432 |edition=1st |location=Garden City, New York |oclc=851669}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lillycomm"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Communication between man and dolphin : the possibilities of talking with other species |last=Lilly |first=John Cunningham |date=1978 |publisher=Crown Publishers |isbn=0517530368 |location=New York |oclc=4036849}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lillyman"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Man and Dolphin |last=Lilly |first=John |publisher=Gollancz  |year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lillyd"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Lilly on Dolphins |last=Lilly |first=John |publisher=Anchor Press |year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilly thought of this as a mother-child dyad, though the dolphin was 5–6 years old.&lt;ref name="lilly177"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Lilly on Dolphins |pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lilly said that he had heard other dolphins repeating his own English words,&lt;ref name="lilly-vocal"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lilly |first=John C. |date=1962 |title=Vocal Behavior of the Bottlenose Dolphin |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=520–529 |doi=10.2307/985258 |jstor=985258}}&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that an intelligent animal would want to mimic the language of its captors, to communicate.&lt;ref name="mind218"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mind of the Dolphin |pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mind196"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mind of the Dolphin |pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment ended in the third month and did not restart, because Howe found the two-room lab and constant bumping from the dolphin too constricting.&lt;ref name="mind300"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mind of the Dolphin |pages=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several weeks, a concerted effort by the dolphin to imitate the instructor's speech was evident, and human-like sounds were apparent, and recorded. It was able to perform tasks such as retrieval of aurally indicated objects without fail. Later in the project the dolphin's ability to process linguistic [[syntax]] was made apparent, in that it could distinguish between commands such as "Bring the ball to the doll," and "Bring the doll to the ball."{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} This ability not only demonstrates the bottlenose dolphin's grasp of basic [[grammar]], but also implies the dolphins' own language might include syntactical rules. The correlation between length and 'syllables' (bursts of the dolphin's sound) with the instructor's speech also went from essentially zero at the beginning of the session to almost a perfect correlation by its completion, so that when the human spoke 5 or 10 syllables, the dolphin also spoke 5 or 10 'syllables' or bursts of sound.&lt;ref name="mind288"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mind of the Dolphin |pages=288–295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two experiments of this sort are explained in detail in Lilly's book, ''Mind of the Dolphin''. The first experiment was more of a test run to check psychological and other strains on the human and cetacean participants, determining the extent of the need for other human contact, dry clothing, time alone, and so on. Despite tensions after several weeks, Howe Lovatt agreed to the {{frac|2|1|2}} months isolated with the dolphin.

Experiments by the research team of [[Louis Herman]], a former collaborator and student of Lilly's, demonstrated that dolphins could understand human communication in whistles and respond with the same whistles.

A female bottlenose dolphin, Phoenix, understood at least 34 whistles
*      34 are listed in Herman, "Cognition and Language Competencies of Bottlenosed Dolphins", in Schusterman et al., Dolphin Cognition and Behavior,1986, [http://smad.homestead.com/p230-Schusterman-Dolphin-Cognition-and-Behavior.pdf p.230]

Whistles created a system of 2-way communication. By having separate whistles for object and action, Herman could reorder commands without fresh teaching (take hoop to ball). Successful communication was shown when Herman used new combinations, and the dolphin understood and did what he asked without further training 80-90% of the time.&lt;ref name=cognition /&gt;

In 1980, Herman had taught 6 whistles to a female bottle-nose dolphin, Kea, to refer to three objects and three actions, and the dolphin followed his instructions. He wrote, "In addition to mouthing the three familiar training objects in the presence of the mouth name, Kea correctly mouthed on their first appearance a plastic water pipe, a wooden disc, and the experimenter's open hand. The same type of immediate response generalization occurred for touch and fetch."&lt;ref name="cetbeh"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cetacean Behavior |last=Herman |first=Louis |publisher=Wiley |year=1980 |pages=413–418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richards, Wolz and Herman&lt;ref name="richards"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Richards |first=D. G. |last2=Wolz |first2=J. P. |last3=Herman |first3=L.

Herman's later publications do not discuss the whistle communication. Herman started getting US Navy funding in 1985,&lt;ref  name="levasseur"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whales7.tripod.com/policies/levasseur/levass2b.html |title=Dolphin Mental Abilities Paper |last=LeVasseur |first=Kenneth |website=whales.org.au |access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; so further expansion of the 2-way whistle language would have been in the classified [[United States Navy Marine Mammal Program]], a [[black project]].

Herman also studied the crossmodal perceptual ability of dolphins. Dolphins typically perceive their environment through sound waves generated in the [[melon (whale)|melon]] of their skulls, through a process known as [[animal echolocation|echolocation]] (similar to that seen in bats, though the mechanism of production is different). The dolphin's eyesight however is also fairly good, even by human standards, and Herman's research found that any object, even of complex and arbitrary shape, identified either by sight or sound by the dolphin, could later be correctly identified by the dolphin with the alternate sense modality with almost 100 per cent accuracy, in what is classically known in [[psychology]] and [[behaviorism]] as a [[Match-to-sample task|match-to-sample test]]. The only errors noted were presumed to have been a misunderstanding of the task during the first few trials, and not an inability of the dolphin's perceptual apparatus. This capacity is strong evidence for abstract and conceptual thought in the dolphin's brain, wherein an idea of the object is stored and understood not merely by its sensory properties; such abstraction may be argued to be of the same kind as complex language, mathematics, and art, and implies a potentially very great intelligence and conceptual understanding within the brains of tursiops and possibly many other cetaceans. Accordingly, Lilly's interest later shifted to [[whale song]] and the possibility of high intelligence in the brains of large [[whales]], and Louis Herman's research at the now misnomered [https://web.archive.org/web/20051228135245/http://www.dolphin-institute.org/ Dolphin Institute] in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], focuses exclusively on the [[Humpback whale]].

==Other animal training==
{{Main|Animal training}}
Humans  teach animals specific responses for specific conditions or stimuli. Training may be for purposes such as companionship, detection, protection, research and entertainment. During training humans communicate their wishes with positive or negative reinforcement. After training is finished the human communicates by giving signals with words, whistles, gestures, body language, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Animal training : successful animal management through positive reinforcement |last=Ramirez |first=Ken |publisher=Shedd Aquarium |year=1999 |isbn=0961107499 |location=Chicago, IL |oclc=45076489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[APOPO]] has trained [[Southern giant pouched rat]]s to communicate to humans the presence of [[land mines]], by scratching the ground, and [[tuberculosis]] in medical samples. They identify 40% more cases of tuberculosis than clinics do, an extra 12,000 cases from 2007-2017. They have identified 100,000 mines from 2003-2017, certifying 2,200 hectares (5,400 acres) as mine-free. They are accurate enough that the human trainers run on the land after removing the mines which rats have identified.&lt;ref name="rats"&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/dec/26/giant-rats-tanzania-tb-tuberculosis-african-pouched |title= The giant rats that love avocado – and can diagnose deadly TB |last= Lyons |first=Kate |date= 2017-12-26 |website= The Guardian |language= en-GB |access-date= 2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patricia McConnell]] found that handlers around the world, speaking 16 languages, working with camels, dogs, donkeys, horses and water buffalo, all use long sounds with a steady pitch to tell animals to go more slowly (whoa, euuuuuu), and they use short repeated sounds, often rising in pitch, to speed them up or bring them to the handler (Go, Go, Go, claps, clicks).

==Animal communication as entertainment==
[[File:Toby the sapient pig.jpg|thumb|Poster for Toby the Sapient pig]]
Though animal communication has always been a topic of public comment and attention, for a period in history it surpassed this and became sensational popular entertainment.  From the late 18th century through the mid 19th century, a succession of "[[learned pig]]s" and various other animals were displayed to the public in for-profit performances, boasting the ability to communicate with their owners (often in more than one language), write, solve math problems, and the like.  One poster dated 1817 shows a group of "[[Java sparrow]]s" who are advertised as knowing seven languages, including [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].

{{Wiktionary}}

'''Identification''' is a term used in [[Literary criticism|literary]] and [[Film theory|film]] studies to describe a psychological relationship between the reader of a novel and a character in the book, or between a spectator in the audience and a character on screen. In both cases, readers and spectators see themselves in the fictional character.

Identification is usually supposed to be largely unconscious: a reader may be aware that she likes a given character, but not that she actually sees that character as an alter ego, a version of her, or a projection of her aspirations for herself.  It would be a mistake to think all heroes foster identification, or that all villains inhibit identification—many, perhaps even most, characters elicit some degree of identification on the part of the reader or spectator. In film, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] exploited the traits of casual identification with specific moments, even when the character was villainous. In ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), Hitchcock explained that as the character Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) was disposing of the car containing Marion Crane's body in a swamp, for a brief moment he had the car stop sinking. "When Perkins is looking at the car sinking in the pond... the public are thinking, 'I hope it goes all the way down!' It's a natural instinct."&lt;ref&gt;Truffaut, Francois (1978) ''Hitchcock'' (Revised Edition) Paladin, p.342&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23042">'''International volunteering''' is when volunteers [[volunteering|contribute their time]] to work for organisations or causes outside their respective home countries. In most such cases, volunteers work in developing countries on [[international development]] programmes with local volunteer organisations that conduct activities such as [[health promotion]], [[education]] and [[environmental conservation]].&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt; Trends show that international volunteering has become increasingly popular across many countries over the past few decades.&lt;ref&gt;Anheier, H. K., &amp; Salamon, L. M. (1999). Volunteering in cross-national perspective: Initial comparisons. Law and Contemporary Problems, 43-65.&lt;/ref&gt; International volunteering is a broad term which is used to capture multi-year, skilled placements as well as short term roles, recently termed ''voluntourism'', and a range of activities in between conducted by [[governments]], [[charities]] and [[travel agents]].&lt;ref name=SMUC/&gt;

==History==
Formal overseas volunteering can be traced back over one hundred years to when the [[British Red Cross]] set up the ''Voluntary Aid Detachment'' (VAD) scheme in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=War-time volunteers and personnel records|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/About-us/Who-we-are/Museum-and-archives/Resources-for-researchers/Volunteers-and-personnel-records|website=British Red Cross|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VAD volunteers, as well as volunteers from many other national Red Cross organisations, worked in battlefields across [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] during [[World War I]] to treat soldiers and civilians regardless of the side they fought for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What did the British Red Cross do during the First World War|url=http://www.redcross.org.uk/~/media/BritishRedCross/Documents/Who%20we%20are/History%20and%20archives/What%20the%20British%20Red%20Cross%20did%20abroad%20during%20the%20First%20World%20War.pdf|website=British Red Cross|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt &amp; JFK Peace Corps.jpg|thumb|300px|Eleanor Roosevelt and President John F. Kennedy discuss the [[Peace Corps]], 1961.]]

Up to the mid-20th century overseas volunteering projects were mainly undertaken by people with direct connections to a particular cause and were considered more as short term in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Douglas |last= McGray |title=Going the Distance |url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/going-the-distance-february-2004 |publisher=Travel and Leisure Magazine |date=February 2004|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more formal inception of international volunteering organisations can be linked to organisations such as [[Australian Volunteers International]] (formerly the ''Volunteer Graduate Scheme'') which formed in 1951, [[International Voluntary Services]] in 1953 in the United States, and [[Voluntary Services Overseas]] (VSO) in 1958 the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Story|url=http://www.australianvolunteers.com/about-us/who-we-are/our-story/|website=Australian Volunteers International|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IVS"&gt;International Voluntary Services.

(1961) |publisher=Ourdocuments.gov |accessdate=October 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s and 1970s a movement of volunteerism and study abroad programs became popular among university students and graduates and the [[United Nations]] launched the [[United Nations Volunteers|UN Volunteers]] programme for young professionals to take part in a long-term (two year plus) overseas programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNV Factsheet 2015|url=http://in.one.un.org/img/uploads/UNV_factsheet_2015.pdf|website=United Nations|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the accessibility of international volunteering has increased significantly with many smaller charities connecting volunteers with non-governmental organisations in developing countries. Travel companies have also increasingly been offering paid-for volunteering opportunities, this growth coincided with the increasing number of young people taking [[gap year]]s and has been termed ''volunteer tourism'' and ''voluntourism'' to denote shorter-term voluntary work that is not necessarily the sole purpose of the trip.&lt;ref name=SMUC&gt;{{cite web|title='Making a Difference': Volunteer Tourism and Development|url=http://research.smuc.ac.uk/280/1/04-Butcher%20and%20Smith.pdf|website=St. Mary's University College|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many opportunities medium- and long-term opportunities for skilled international volunteers remain, for example, the publicised role of volunteers in addressing the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ebola volunteers - what you need to know|url=https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/nov/12/ebola-volunteers-how-to-prepare|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=16 April 2015|date=2014-11-12|last1=Hanniffy|first1=Darren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volunteer base==
International volunteering appeals to a broad cross-section of society, but the majority of volunteers are in their twenties and thirties, potentially due to perceptions of volunteering abroad being a more risky activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Amanda|title=Access to International Volunteering|url=http://csd.wustl.edu/Publications/Documents/WP08-30.pdf|website=Washington University|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average age of VSO volunteers, however, is 38, showing a broad range of participation across age groups.&lt;ref name=VSO/&gt; Many participants use these trips to boost their resumes, travel with friends, gain world experience, and see new countries. Recently there has been an increase in [[baby boomer]] volunteers.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} One possible explanation for the increase is that these people are transitioning into a new stage of life and their focus may shift toward finding activities that give their life new meaning. Shorter-term voluntourism is therefore appealing to some, as it is targeted at travellers who want to make a positive change in the world, while still providing a touristic experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Voluntourism is on the Rise | journal = Travel Agent | date = 2007-09-17 | first = Mark | last = Rogers | volume = 331 | issue = 3 | pages = 20–4| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  People generally volunteer in order to increase their international awareness, to contextualize poverty and its effects, as an education opportunity, and to help people while having a morally rewarding experience. Many believe that the trip will change the way they think when they return home. However, others are just looking to give to others and do not believe that their experience will cause them to think twice about their lives back home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Youth as Voluntourists: A Case Study of Youth Volunteering in Guatemala | journal = Undercurrent: The Canadian Undergraduate Journal of Development Studies | date = Fall–Winter 2011 | volume = 7 | issue = 3| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques and challenges==
{{see also|Volunteering#Difficulties in cross-national aid}}
Certain critiques and challenges are associated with international volunteering.

===Outcomes===
Measuring the outcomes of international volunteering is an ongoing challenge. Sometimes the costs invested in these partnerships are high. The intangible nature of impact and outcomes is hard to measure and research has been proposed in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Sherraden, M. S., Lough, B., &amp; McBride, A. M. (2008). Effects of international volunteering and service: Individual and institutional predictors. Voluntas: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations, 19(4), 395-421.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, how to measure the success of a volunteer and the supporting organisation's performance is complicated.&lt;ref name="Dev"&gt;Devereux, P. (2008). International volunteering for development and sustainability: outdated paternalism or a radical response to globalisation?. Development in Practice, 18(3), 357-370.&lt;/ref&gt; To allow volunteers to integrate properly into the community, it is essential that volunteers have some useful skills and are reasonably well-informed and trained before the placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raymond|first=Eliza|author2=Michael Hall|year=2008|title=The Development of Cross-Cultural (Mis)Understanding Through Volunteer Tourism|journal=Journal of Sustainable Tourism|volume=16|issue=5|pages=530–543|doi=10.2167/jost796.0|id=}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-12-03 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shannon O'Donnell (writer)|Shannon O'Donnell]], a vocal critic of poorly designed international programs, contends that many volunteer organizations compromise the dignity of local populations—these programs often foster a cyclical dependency international volunteers within the communities the programs are designed to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Donnell|first1=Shannon|title=The Psychology and Ethics of International Volunteering|url=http://blog.grassrootsvolunteering.org/ethics-of-international-volunteering/|accessdate=30 October 2017|publisher=Grassroots Volunteering|date= 31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===
Related to the impact of international volunteering, the cost of having an international volunteer has been cited as another area of concern, especially costs for air tickets, allowances, insurance, training and logistics. Local staff do require such costs, and the local organisations could put these funds into more important issues; however, many volunteers pay these expenses personally.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt; Some institutions provide scholarships for international volunteering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://maximonivel.com/volunteers/|title=Volunteer Abroad Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=maximonivel.com|publisher=Maximo Nivel|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteers are far cheaper than other forms of long-term technical assistance because they live and work under local conditions. Expatriates who work in the same capacity can be paid multiple times more than any allowances volunteers receive (if any).&lt;ref name=Dev/&gt; The cost-benefit of international volunteers is hard to quantify, though studies have highlighted improvements in well-being and inter-cultural understanding in communities and schools as a result of international exchanges and volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lough, B.  |author2=Matthews, L.|title=Forum Discussion Paper: Measuring and Conveying the Added Value of International Volunteering.|date=2013|url=https://www.france-volontaires.org/IMG/pdf/ivco2013_measuring_and_conveying_the_added_value_of__international_volunteering_lough.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration in the workplace===

A consideration is that volunteers may dominate the workplace, undermine local management and work culture especially in small organisations. This is due to volunteers often being considered more highly educated than local staff, even if they do not have direct experience. Coming from a different culture can also lead to volunteers imposing their values on organisations.&lt;ref name=Dev/&gt;

Indeed, volunteers can have a strong influence on organisations, especially those who deal with [[governance]] and management. However, volunteers are often trained to respect the local working culture and ethics.&lt;ref name=VSO/&gt; Also, since they report directly to local organisations, they can have their contracts terminated if they break any local regulations, which further minimises the fear of domination.&lt;ref name=Dev/&gt;

===Skills, experience and understanding of local context===

International volunteers from outside the host community can lack an understanding of the local context and sometimes may not have the correct skill-set to achieve their project goal.&lt;ref name=Dev/&gt; There is sometimes a vetting or selection process for volunteers before they are recruited to serve in developing countries, but this process has at times been found wanting.&lt;ref name="Mangold, K. 2012"&gt;Mangold, K. (2012). ‘Struggling to Do the Right Thing’: challenges during international volunteering. Third World Quarterly, 33(8), 1493-1509.&lt;/ref&gt; According to some,{{who|date=June 2018}} international volunteers today receive significant training before and often during their placement which can address this deficit.&lt;ref name=VSO&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burns|first1=L|title=Role of Volunteering in Sustainable Development|url=http://www.vsointernational.org/sites/vso_international/files/the_role_of_volunteering_in_sustainable_development_2015_vso_ids.pdf|website=VSO|publisher=VSO &amp; Institute of Development Studies|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others counter that there are countless multinational organizations offering unskilled volunteer placements to any participant willing to pay the placement fee. In these circumstances, there is conflict about whether the fees volunteers pay justify the time spent supervising and revising their work, and if a sufficient portion of the fees make it into the local communities hosting volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon O'Donnell. "The Volunteer Traveler's Handbook," Full Flight Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivations of volunteers===
People volunteer for many reasons, but seldom does anyone volunteer strictly for monetary reasons, as very few organisations offer a stipend for volunteering.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;Palmer, Michael. “[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4029408 On the Pros and Cons of Volunteering Abroad.]” ''Development in Practice'', vol. 12, no. 5, 2002, pp. 637–643.&lt;/ref&gt; More compelling motives include experiencing another culture, meeting new people, and advancing one's career prospects. Such motivations are common among younger volunteers who are looking for experience or direction in their careers.&lt;ref name="Mangold, K. 2012"/&gt;

A common motivation is to "make a difference"&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt; and to "achieve something positive for others"&lt;ref name=Reh&gt;Rehberg, W. (2005). Altruistic individualists: Motivations for international volunteering among young adults in Switzerland. Voluntas: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations, 16(2), 109-122.&lt;/ref&gt; who are less fortunate than the volunteer. Many volunteers tend to concur that there are disadvantaged people in their home countries, but the scale of disadvantage outside their home countries is felt to be greater. Volunteering at home may elicit images of helping the less fortunate, or campaigning with a local pressure group.&lt;ref name=Reh/&gt; Volunteering abroad has tended to be associated with [[international development]] and bridging the divide between the rich and poor worlds. Volunteering abroad often seems a more worthy contribution in this context to the volunteers than work in their own country. This perspective is particularly true of volunteers who are older and looking for something more value-based as they near the end of their professional careers or after their children have left home.&lt;ref name=Palmer/&gt;

=== Neo-colonialism ===
There have been allegations from some quarters of neo-colonial advances disguised as an effort to tackle poverty, as some volunteer organisations are connected to national governments, e.g. the [[Peace Corps]], which was set up by the American government.&lt;ref name="SMUC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.smuc.ac.uk/280/1/04-Butcher%20and%20Smith.pdf|title='Making a Difference': Volunteer Tourism and Development|website=St. Mary's University College|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this challenge, most volunteer organisations are non-governmental ([[NGOs]]) and are not influenced by government policies.&lt;ref name="Dev"/&gt; The present structures of international volunteering are also often aimed at impacts on a local, community scale which is sharply in contrast with the macro-political government strategies of the colonial era.&lt;ref name="SMUC2" /&gt;

However, many academic journals elaborate that volunteers often have little knowledge or expertise in the work they do when volunteering abroad. This has raised concerns of its value. Frances Brown and Derek Hall write that this creates a neo-colonial narrative. They say the volunteer perspective is framed around the idea that Westerners with minimal experience can effect change in the Global South, just by nature of being from the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Frances|last2=Hall|first2=Derek|date=2008-07-01|title=Tourism and Development in the Global South: the issues|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=29|issue=5|pages=839–849|doi=10.1080/01436590802105967|issn=0143-6597}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perpetuates the narrative of Western domination in a post-colonial world, and the need to "save" and "help" the Global South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palacios|first=Carlos M.|date=2010-08-20|title=Volunteer tourism, development and education in a postcolonial world: conceiving global connections beyond aid|journal=Journal of Sustainable Tourism|volume=18|issue=7|pages=861–878|doi=10.1080/09669581003782739|issn=0966-9582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Voluntourism: criticisms ==
Volunteer tourism, also known as "voluntourism", is a specific kind of international volunteering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchmayer|first=Kelsey|date=2017|title=Voluntourism Discourse: A Case Study of ME to WE|url=|journal=School of International Development and Global Studies, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ottawa|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized as being conducted by profit-making companies rather than charities, by the age of the participants, and by the length of time they volunteer abroad.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Butcher|first=Jim|last2=Smith|first2=Peter|date=2010|title='Making a Difference': Volunteer Tourism and Development|journal=Tourism Recreation Research|volume=35 |issue=1|pages=27–36|doi=10.1080/02508281.2010.11081616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants are often young adults (ages 15–30), the length of the trip is under a month, and the volunteering is regularly packaged with adventure and travel activities. Voluntourism has undergone intense scrutiny over the course of the 2000s, and an increasing number of academic papers question volunteer tourists' motivations and experiences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Volunteer-sending organizations, such as [[WE Charity|Free The Children]]'s [[Me to We]] trips and the British company Projects-abroad, have been critiqued as furthering the aforementioned neo-colonial narrative to youth. The increased prevalence of promotional material regarding trips to "help" the Global South has "increased media exposure in the Global North to poverty in the Global South."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeddies|first=Margaret|last2=Millei|first2=Zsuzsa|title="It takes a global village": Troubling discourses of global citizenship in United Planet's voluntourism|journal=Global Studies of Childhood|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=100–111|doi=10.1177/2043610615573383|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics argue that the way in which these organizations advertise their trips stigmatizes and frames the developing world as helpless. This plays into Maria Eriksson Baaz's theories in the book ''Paternalism of Partnership: a Postcolonial Reading of Identity in Development Aid'', in which she discusses discourse that frames the volunteer as a developed, paternalistic individual and the donor as underdeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Paternalism of Partnership: A Postcolonial Reading of Identity in Development Aid|last=Baaz|first=Maria Eriksson|publisher=Zed Books|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framing and "othering" of cultures outside the West and Global North can also be found in [[Edward Said]]'s text, ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]''. His theory is rooted in the same idea, in which he describes West's patronizing portrayals of the East.

Other criticisms of the voluntourism industry are that not only are short-term volunteers often untrained in the projects they participate in (building schools, health centres, wells),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herrmann|first=S|date=2011|title=Holding on to transformation: Reflections on global service learning|url=|journal=Critical Service-Learning as Revolutionary Pedagogy|volume=|pages=273–296|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guttentag|first=D|date=2009|title=The possible negative impacts of volunteer tourism|url=|journal=International Journal of Tourism Research|volume=11|pages=145–158|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=K|date=2005|title=Doing Development: the gap year, volunteer tourists and a popular practice of development|url=|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=16 |issue=5|pages=681–692|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that projects can fuel conflict among communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doerr|first=E|date=2011|title=Cognitive dissonance in international service-learning: Possibilities and challenges for service-learning pedagogy|url=|journal=Critical Service-Learning as Revolutionary Pedagogy|volume=|pages=71–94|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer bandaid solutions, replace work locals could be doing, and reinforce neoliberal policies. Children in these communities may become dependent and commodified when volunteers are constantly arriving and departing every couple weeks. The rhetoric of such volunteer-sending organizations has also been argued to inform a "consumer-capitalist"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jefferess|first=David|date=2012|title=The "Me to We" social enterprise: Global education as lifestyle brand|url=|journal=Critical Literacy: Theories and Practices|volume=6|pages=1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/nov/14/orphans-cambodia-aids-holidaysmadonna|title=Before you pay to volunteer abroad, think of the harm you might do|last=Birrell|first=I|date=2010|work=The Guardian|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; culture that plays to the wants and needs of the privileged North, at the disadvantage of the Global South.

'''Katto''' is a ceremonial ritual initiated by the ruling [[Shah dynasty]] of [[Nepal]], and observed following the deaths of its [[king of Nepal|kings]]. In 2001, when a [[massacre]] in the [[royal palace]] saw two kings die in less than a week, the “katto khane” ritual was reported very explicitly.

The ceremony is performed on the eleventh day of the King's death. In this ceremony a vegetarian Brahmin is made to eat a elaborate non-vegetarian meal, given various items belonging to the deceased King as gifts and made to wear clothing belonging to the deceased King in the belief that by doing so, the partaker will absorb all the bad [[karma]] of the dead king. The stigmatized Brahmin is then put on the back of an [[elephant]] and [[scapegoat|ordered to leave]] the [[Realm|kingdom]]. Many Nepalese believe that the Katto meal consists of parts from the body of the deceased King. However, Ramesh Prasad Pande, the Royal Brahmin of the Shah dynasty of Nepal who oversaw the rituals after the Royal massacre in 2001 revealed that no such thing occurs, and such hearsay are just myths. Durga Prasad Sapkota and Devi Prasad Acharya who performed the katto ritual of King [[Birendra of Nepal|Birendra]] and King [[Dipendra of Nepal|Dipendra]] revealed the same and said that the ritual is symbolic. Katto rituals used to be performed by Indian Brahmins in the past. The katto ritual of King [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuwan]] was performed by Bhatta Brahmin from India. The katto ritual of King [[Mahendra of Nepal|Mahendra]] was performed by Shri Ganesh Bhatta.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/health/nepal-seeks-to-end-social-malpractices_100551851.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mocko2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne T.

'''Khosrow and Shirin''' ({{lang-fa|خسرو و شیرین}}) is the title of a famous [[Persian people|Persian]] tragic romance by the poet [[Nizami Ganjavi]] (1141–1209), who also wrote [[Layla and Majnun]]. It tells a highly elaborated fictional version of the story of the love of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Khosrau II|Khosrow II]] for the [[Armenians|Armenian]] princess [[Shirin]], who becomes queen of [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'' ([http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kosrow-o-sirin "Ḵosrow o Širin"] ''Encyclopædia Iranica'', Paola Orsatti)"'''''Two traditions''' soon formed around the figure of Širin: one in her favor, '''with its roots in Armenia and in the Christian regions of the Caucasus, where, as we have seen, Neẓāmi found his source;''' and the second, represented in the Šāh-nāma, where Širin is shown as a woman of humble origin and ill repute, who makes merciless use of poison (in Ferdowsi, Širin, wrought with jealousy, poisons Maryam).''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'' ([http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farhad%20(1) "Farhad"] ''Encyclopædia Iranica'', Heshmat Moayyad)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Khuzistan Chronicle'', written by a Syriac Christian from Khuzistan (Beth Huzaye in Aramaic/Syriac) [Iran], probably in 680, is described as the Syriac counterpart of the Armenian work of Sebeos. We read about the relationship between the bishop Isho Yahb and the Persian king Khosrau II Parvez (590–628): "Isho Yahb was treated respectfully throughout his life, by the king himself and his two Christian wives Shirin the Aramean and Mary the Roman". (Theodor. Nöldeke: ''Die von Guidi herausgegebene syrische Chronik'', Wien 1893, p. 10.) The ''Chronicle of Séert'' (Siirt) is an anonymously authored historiographical text written by the Nestorian Church in Persia and the Middle East, possibly as early as the 9th century AD. The text deals with ecclesiastical, social, and political issues of the Christian church giving a history of its leaders and notable members. LVIII.&amp;nbsp;– History of Khosrau Parvez, son of Hormizd "Khosrau, by gratitude for Maurice, ordered to rebuild churches and to honor the Christians. He built himself two churches for Marie (Maryam) and a large church and a castle in the country of Beth Lashpar for his wife Shirin, the Aramean." (''Patrologia Orientalis'', Tome VII.&amp;nbsp;– Fascicule 2, Histoire Nestorienne (Chronique de Séert), Seconde Partie (1), publiée et traduite par Mgr Addai Scher, Paris 1911, Published Paris : Firmin-Didot 1950 p. 467.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johan Christoph Burgel &amp; Christine van Ruyuymbeke, "Nizami: A Key to the Treasure of the Hakim ", Amsterdam University Press, 2011. pg 145: "Shirin is presented as an Armenian princess&lt;/ref&gt; The essential narrative is a love story of [[Persian people|Persian]] origin which was already well-known from the great epico-historical poem the [[Shahnameh]] and other Persian writers and popular tales, and other works have the same title.&lt;ref&gt;Chelkowski, P. "Nezami's Iskandarnameh:"in Colloquio sul poeta persiano Nizami e la leggenda iranica di Alessandro magno, Roma,1977). pp 10: "The Persian legend of Alexander the Great seems to overshadow all of the other fantastic Alexander stories not only in the tale of the successful accomplishment of many a "mission-impossible" but especially concerning the nature of his career. In Iran he rose from the stature of a damned evil conqueror of the country, to that of a national Iranian hero king, and even more, to that of the great prophet of God, preparing all the nations for the true religion. Yet the Persian legend of Alexander is very little known in the Western world."" pp 13: "Nizami was a typical product of the Iranian culture. He created a bridge between Islamic Iran and pre-Islamic Iran and also between Iran and the whole ancient world. His great humanism, strong character, sensibility, drama, colorful description of nature, rich language, and the poetic genius created a new standard of literary achievements and captured the imagination of countless imitators". pg 17: "In the case of previous romances of Khosraw and Bahram, Nizami dealt with national Iranian heroes, though from pre-Islamic times. In the tale of Layla and Majnun, the Arab nationality of the lover is of no importance since the story is based on a simple Arab folktale which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians". pp 19: "Alexander was glorified by the Muslims as a divine agent, a prophet-king and the blessed conqueror of the lands that were to become the stronghold of Islam. To some Muslims, Islam was a realization of Alexander's "koine" --- a commonwealth where people could live in harmony and in peace of heart and mind. In this atmosphere attempts were made to make out of Alexander not only a Muslim but a Persian as well". pg 21: "However, it was not Tabari directly, but Ferdowsi who was Nizami's source of inspiration and material in composing Iskandarnameh. Nizami constantly alludes to the Shahnameh in his writing, especially in the prologue to the Iskandarnameh. It seems that he was always fascinated by the work of Firdawsi and made it a goal of his life to write an heroic epic of the same stature. pg22: "It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading Firdawsi's monumental epic Shahnameh (The book of Kings)". pg 22: "In fact, although Alexander conquered Iran, he was soon conquered by Persian customs and ways of life. In many aspects he was so overwhelmed by Persian civilization that he became more Persian than the Persians. He tried to make a blend of the Greek and Persian civilization --- even genetically, when he sponsored mass marriages between his troops and Persian women. He himself married Roxane (Rowshanak) the daughter of the Sogdian prince&amp;nbsp;– not the daughter of Darius the Third, as both Firdawsi and Nizami believed. Like Alexander, Arabs, Turks, Mongols and other people who overran the Iranian plateau also came under the spell of Persian culture. Foreign invaders remained to become contributors and patrons of Persian art and culture. To give one example, some of Nizami's benefactors were of Turkic stock."&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants of the story were also told under the titles '''"Shirin and Farhad"''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: شیرین و فرهاد).

==Plot==
Nezami's version begins with an account of Khosrow's birth and his education. This is followed by an account of Khosrow's feast in a farmer's house; for which Khosrow is severely chastised by his father. Khosrow asks forgiveness and repents his offence. [[Hormizd IV]], who is now pleased with his son, forgives him. That very night, Khosrow sees his grandfather [[Khosrau I|Anushirvan]] in a dream and Anushirvan gives him glad tidings of a wife named [[Shirin]], a steed named [[Shabdiz]], a musician named [[Barbad]], and a great kingdom, that is [[Persia]].

Shapur, Khosrow's close friend and a painter, tells Khosrow of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] queen [[Mahin Banu]] and her niece Shirin. Hearing Shapur's descriptions of Shirin's flawless features, the young prince falls in love with Shirin, the Armenian princess. Shapur travels to [[Persian Armenia|Armenia]] to look for Shirin. Shapur finds Shirin and shows the image of Khosrow to Shirin. Shirin falls in love with Khosrow and escapes from Armenia to Khosrow's capital [[Mada'in]]; but meanwhile, Khosrow also flees from his father's anger and sets out for Armenia in search of Shirin.

On the way, he finds Shirin unclothed bathing and washing her flowing hair; Shirin also sees him; but since Khosrow was traveling in peasant clothes, they do not recognize one another. Khosrow arrives in Armenia and is welcomed by [[Shamira]] the queen of Armenia - yet he finds out that Shirin is in Mada'in. Again, Shapur is sent to bring Shirin. When Shirin reached Armenia again, Khosrow&amp;nbsp;– because of his father's death- has to return to Mada'in. The two lovers keep going to opposite places till finally Khosrow is overthrown by a general named [[Bahrām Chobin]] and flees to Armenia.

In Armenia, Khosrow finally meets Shirin and is welcomed by her. Shirin, however, does not agree to marry Khosrow; unless Khosrow first claims his country back from Bahram Chobin. Thus, Khosrow leaves Shirin in Armenia and goes to [[Constantinople]]. The Caesar agrees to assist him against Bahram Chobin on condition that he marry his daughter Mariam. Khosrow is also forced to promise not to marry as long as Mariam is alive. Khosrow succeeds in defeating his enemy and reclaims his throne. Mariam, due to her jealousy, keeps Khosrow away from Shirin.

Meanwhile, a sculptor named [[Farhad (Persian literature)|Farhad]] falls in love with Shirin and becomes Khosrow's love-rival. Khosrow cannot abide Farhad, so he sends him as an exile to [[Behistun]] mountain with the impossible task of carving stairs out of the cliff rocks. Farhad begins his task hoping that Khosrow will allow him to marry Shirin. Yet, Khosrow sends a messenger to Farhad and gives him false news of Shirin's death. Hearing this false news, Farhad throws himself from the mountaintop and dies. Khosrow writes a letter to Shirin, expressing his regret for Farhad's death. Soon after this incident, Mariam also dies. According to [[Ferdowsi]]'s version, it was Shirin who secretly poisoned Mariam. Shirin replies to Khosrow's letter with another satirical letter of condolences.

Khosrow, before proposing marriage to Shirin, tries to have intimacy with another woman named Shekar in [[Isfahan]], which further delays the lovers' union. Finally, Khosrow goes to Shirin's castle to see her. Shirin, seeing that Khosrow is drunk, does not let him in the castle. She particularly reproaches Khosrow for his intimacy with Shekar. Khosrow, sad and rejected, returns to his palace.

Shirin eventually consents to marry Khosrow after several romantic and heroic episodes. Yet, [[Kavadh II|Shiroyeh]], Khosrow's son from his wife Mariam, is also in love with Shirin. Shiroyeh finally murders his father Khosrow and sends a messenger to Shirin conveying that after one week, she would have to marry him. Shirin, in order to avoid marrying Shiroy, kills herself. Khosrow and Shirin were buried together in one grave.

==Popularity in Persian literature==
[[File:Khosrow and Shirin-page0085.jpeg|thumb|right|220px|[[Khosrau II|Khosrow Parviz]] and [[Shirin]] in an 18th-century miniature]]
There are many references to the legend throughout the poetry of other Persian poets including Farrokhi, Qatran, Mas'ud-e Sa'd-e Salman, Othman Mokhtari, Naser Khusraw, Anwari and Sanai. [[Nizam al-Mulk]] mentioned that the legend was a popular story in his era.&lt;ref name="iranica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/farhad%20(1)|author=Heshmat Moayyad|title=Farhad |work=Encyclopedia Iranica |date=1999-12-15 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nizami's version===

Although the story was known before [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], it was brought to its greatest romantic height by him. Unlike the ''Shahnameh'', which focuses on the history, kingship and battles of Khosrow, Nizami decided to focus on the romantic aspect of the story.

When the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] Sultan Arsalan Shah requested a love epic from the poet without specifying the subject further, Nizami picked on the story of lovers Khosrow and Shirin, a theme set in his own region and based on at least partly historical facts, though an aura of legend already surrounded it.

[[Nizami Ganjavi]] (1141–1209) himself considered it the sweetest story in the world:

{{cquote|The tale of Khosraw and Shirin is well known&lt;br /&gt;
And by Truth, there is no sweeter story than it.}}

It is believed to be one of the best works of Nizami. His first wife Afaq died after it was completed. Many versions of Nizami's work have been retold. The story has a constant forward drive with exposition, challenge, mystery, crisis, climax, resolution, and finally, catastrophe.

Besides Ferdowsi, Nizami's poem was influenced by [[Asad Gorgani]] and his "[[Vis and Rāmin]]".&lt;ref name="DavisIranica"&gt;{{cite web |author=Dick Davis |date=2005-01-06 |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/vis-o-ramin |title=Vis o Rāmin |work=Encyclopaedia Iranica  |accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is of the same meter and has similar scenes. Nizami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in the elaborate astrological description of the night sky in ''Vis and Ramin''. Nizami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the [[Sufi]] influences, which are seen in Nizami's epic poetry.

==Influence==
According to the ''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'': "The influence of the legend of Farhad is not limited to literature, but permeates the whole of Persian culture, including folklore and the fine arts. Farhad's helve supposedly grew into a tree with medicinal qualities, and there are popular laments for Farhad, especially among the Kurds (Mokri)."&lt;ref name="iranica.com"/&gt;

In 2011, the Iranian government's censors refused permission for a publishing house to reprint the centuries-old classic poem that had been a much-loved component of Persian literature for 831 years. While the Iranian Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance offered no immediate official explanation for refusing to permit the firm to publish their eighth edition of the classic, the Islamic government's concerns reportedly centered on the "indecent" act of the heroine, Shirin, in embracing her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/iranian_censors_heavy_hand_falls_on_a_persian_classic/24299532.html|title=Iranian Censors' Heavy Hand Falls On A Persian Classic|work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orhan Pamuk]]'s novel ''[[My Name Is Red]]'' (1998) has a plot line between two characters, Shekure and Black, which echoes the Khosrow and Shirin story, which is also retold in the book. The novel uses the Turkish spelling of Khosrow's name, Hüsrev.

==Other versions==

The tale has been retold by countless [[Sufi]] poets and writers in areas which were previously part of the Persian Empire or had Persian influences, such as the northern parts of the neighboring [[Indian subcontinent]]. In Europe, the story was told by Hungarian novelist [[Mór Jókai]]. However, the story is usually told under the name of "Shirin Farhad". It is a standard tale used in [[Punjabi Qisse]]. The story has been filmed five times:
1926,&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0239979|Shirin Farhad (1926)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1931,&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0234717|Shirin Farhad (1931)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1945,&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0387590|Shirin Farhad (1945)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1956 starring [[Madhubala]] and [[Pradeep Kumar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0129370|Shirin Farhad (1956)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0318690|Shirin Farhad (1975)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale was used as the inspiration for a 2008 Iranian film, ''[[Shirin (film)|Shirin]]'', made by [[Abbas Kiarostami]]. In this formally unusual film, the story is told via the reactions of an audience of Iranian women as they sit watching the film in a cinema. The viewer has to divine the story by only ever seeing these emoting faces and listening to the film's soundtrack.

The story was also referenced in the [[Jonathan Richman]] song "Shirin and Farhad"

The tale was also an inspiration for the 2012 Bollywood romantic comedy ''[[Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi]]''.

[[Image:Phillip Museum.jpg|250px|thumb|The golden larnax and the golden crown of [[Philip II of Macedon]], [[Vergina]] Museum.]]
A '''larnax''' (plural: '''larnakes'''; {{lang-grc|λάρναξ}}, ''lárnaks'', plural: {{lang|grc|λάρνακες}}, ''lárnakes'') is a type of small closed coffin, box or "ash-chest" often used as a container for human remains in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan culture]] and [[Greek antiquity]], either a body (bent on itself) or [[cremation|cremated]] ashes.

The first larnakes appeared in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] times during the [[Aegean Bronze Age]], when they took the form of ceramic coffers designed to imitate wooden chests, perhaps on the pattern of Egyptian linen chests. They were richly decorated with abstract patterns, [[octopus]]es and scenes of hunting and cult rituals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030621115605/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/03/eus/ho_1996.521a%2Cb.htm Minoan larnax from the Metropolitan]; [https://web.archive.org/web/20071127054336/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/t/terracotta_coffin_larnax.aspx British Museum: Late Minoan larnax from Knossos, Crete]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the later [[Hellenistic]] period, larnakes in the form of small terracotta sarcophagi became popular, some of which were painted in similar styles to contemporary Greek [[vase]]s.

In a few special cases, larnakes appear to have been made out of precious materials, as in the 4th century BC example found at [[Vergina]] in northern Macedonia, of gold, with a sun motif (hence known as the "[[Vergina Sun]]" motif) on the lid.
[[Manolis Andronikos]], the leader of the archaeological excavation, posited that the larnax most likely contained the remains of  King [[Philip II of Macedonia]], father of [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name="Andronikos1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manolis Andronikos|title=The Finds from the Royal Tombs at Vergina|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vEnpPwAACAAJ|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-85672-204-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Live Forever as You Are Now with Alan Resnick''''' is a television special written, created and directed by [[Alan Resnick]] and [[Ben O'Brien]] for [[Adult Swim]], as part of the [[Infomercials (TV_specials)|Infomercials]] series. The special is presented as a [[parody]] of [[self-help]] [[infomercial]]s, advertising a four-step program for creating a digital [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] that acts a backup of its host. The special is hosted by [[Alan Resnick]] as himself, and is presented by [[Dan Deacon]]. Both, along with O'Brien, are members of the Baltimore-based art collective [[Wham City]], who co-produced the episode under their video production division, AB Video Solutions.

The special aired on December 24, 2013 at 4&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Cartoon Network's late-night programming block, Adult Swim. The special was viewed by 926,000 viewers and received a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household rating]] of 0.7. Critical reception was positive, with both the humor and the performances receiving praise.

==Summary==
[[Alan Resnick]] (portrayed by himself), an emerging young tech expert and innovator, is introduced to the viewer. He tells the audience of his four-step program to create a digital avatar that acts as a backup of its host, granting "the secret to eternal life". He tells the audience of his past: two years ago, Resnick was banished to his couch after getting into a lovers' spat with his wife, Janet. He dreamt of himself in a foggy meadow with an attractive, nude young woman (portrayed by "MKNZ") who calls for him to engage in sex. He initially refuses, but then changes his mind, but before they are able to do so, he is shot with a gun by a nameless man (Ben O'Brien), which totally destroys his face. This gave him the idea to come up with a way to digitally back himself up. Two months pass, and he is able to create an "exact digital copy" of himself who calls himself "Teddy" (for unknown reasons). "Teddy", a floating avatar head, acts as the co-host for the remainder of the program, often interrupting Resnick's speech to talk about his "wife".

Resnick goes on to explain the four steps behind his process:
# Subjects are instructed to look in a mirror every night for five hours and observe their facial features, sketching what they recall while in the dark; subjects are then instructed to hang up said drawings around their house.
# The subject comes over to Resnick's house, where blindingly bright patterns are projected into their eyes and face while they spin around. These patterns will be "queered" by their head form, generating three-point axes, which are then "booleaned" to generate a three-dimensional mesh of their head. Resnick then goes on to explain the "[[uncanny valley]]", which leads him into his third step:
# The avatars are put through a series of intensive "skin [[Stress testing|stress tests]]", including "ball tests", "wiggle tests" and "durability and tear testing".
# Resnick comes into his subjects' house for two months to analyze their interests and personality types; he will ask "hundreds of personal questions" involving friends, furniture, romance, animals, food, events and touch. All the information will be scanned into the [[USB flash drive]] of the subject's computer, which makes the "brain" of their avatar.

Various testimonials are then given; a [[widow]]er and "textbook salesman" Ryan Syrell (Steve Izant) tells of the reconstruction of his wife Morgan and the creation of his own avatar. Jordan Card, an elderly woman, shows off her digital avatar, who insists that their room "is too cold." Chester Gwazda (Caynen Couture), a young bedridden boy, says that it was his mother's (Michelle Word) idea, and that he would rather play [[American football|football]] than go [[bodyboarding|boogie boarding]] with his avatar. Concluding his seminar, Resnick thanks his audience and "Teddy", who speaks again of the love for his wife, shown to be a pink morphing sphere. A frustrated Resnick scolds his creation and informs the audience that his avatar is autonomous, and that he is being manipulative and disappointing. He reminds the viewer to purchase his program through the following informational screen.

==Production==
[[File:Margaret Wertheim speaking at TED in 2009.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Resnick's skit, on which the special is based, is roughly modeled after [[TED Talk]]s ''(example pictured)''.]]
The series was originally developed as a comedy sketch by Alan Resnick, as part of his comedy tours with the Baltimore-based art collective Wham City, best known for their work with Dan Deacon.&lt;ref name="The New Yorker2014"/&gt; The skit, first conceived in 2009&lt;ref name="Rhizome2011"/&gt; and roughly modeled after [[TED Talk]]s, features Resnick telling the audience how to create a complete digital backup of himself.&lt;ref name="Woods2014"/&gt; Long-time associate Ben O'Brien co-produced, directed and edited the special along with Resnick.&lt;ref name="O'Brien2013"/&gt; In addition, both co-produced the episode under their video production division, AB Video Solutions.&lt;ref name="Wham City 'Wham City brings batshit comedy'"/&gt; Resnick, along with set decorator Emma Alamo, transformed Resnick's house into the set of the special.&lt;ref name="Woods2014"/&gt;

The collective had pitched a Wham City television sitcom to Adult Swim before, but according to Resnick, the network insisted that "no one would ever watch more than one episode."&lt;ref name="Woods2014"/&gt; Resnick named ''[[Mr. Show with Bob and David]]'', ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'' and the ''[[Upright Citizens Brigade (TV series)|Upright Citizens Brigade]]'' as influences on the special.&lt;ref name="Jones2014"/&gt; [[Dave Hughes (producer)|Dave Hughes]], creator of the series ''[[Off the Air (TV series)|Off the Air]]'', who had discussed with the group about developing a series, took note of Resnick's sketch and helped the collective develop it into an infomercial.&lt;ref name="Woods2014"/&gt; After airing the special, Wham City featured the skit for their comedy tour of New York City.&lt;ref name="The New Yorker2014"/&gt; Resnick informed [[Network Awesome]] that they will probably not produce any more fake infomercials, and that O'Brien is working with the network to create something that viewers will "stumble on unintentionally."&lt;ref name="Jones2014"/&gt;

==Broadcast and reception==
''Live Forever as You Are Now with Alan Resnick'' aired on December 24, 2013 at 4&amp;nbsp;a.m. on Adult Swim. It was the third in a series of infomercial parodies broadcast by the network, succeeding ''Broomshakalaka'' and ''[[For-Profit Online University]]''.&lt;ref name="TV Guide2014"/&gt; The early-morning timeslot was chosen since infomercials usually air during such hours.&lt;ref name="Resnick2013"/&gt; The special was published onto Adult Swim's YouTube channel the same day.&lt;ref name="Woods2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="YouTube2013"/&gt; The special was viewed by 926,000 viewers and received a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household rating]] of 0.7, meaning that approximately 0.7 percent of households with a television watched it.&lt;ref name="Pucci2014"/&gt; A [[web chat]] allowing users to converse with "Teddy" was created for the network's website.&lt;ref name="Woods2014"/&gt;

The special has received positive critical reception. In talking about Resnick with regards to the special, ''[[Baltimore City Paper]]''{{'s}} Baynard Woods wrote that it "combines the traditional kind-of-creepy positivity of the infomercial host with the creepy techno-utopian positivity of a TED Talk's technologist."&lt;ref name="Woods2014"/&gt; He ultimately opined that the humor derived from "the disconnect between what Resnick claims—that his avatar is a complete backup of himself—and the reality that it is not at all like him and is, in fact, extremely limited."&lt;ref name="Woods2014"/&gt; Ezra Lefko of ''[[What Weekly]]'', another Baltimore-based publication, praised the special. In particular, he expressed his approval of seeing "success and national exposure for these talented artists."&lt;ref name="Lefko2014"/&gt; Lea McLellan of ''[[Mountain Xpress]]'' called it "hilarious" and "a good representation of their bizarre comedic stylings."&lt;ref name="McLellan2014"/&gt;

Massachusett is an indigenous [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] of the [[Algic languages|Algic language family]].  It was the primary language of several peoples of New England, including the [[Massachusett people|Massachusett]] in the area roughly corresponding to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], including much of the [[Metrowest]] and [[South Shore (Massachusetts)|South Shore]] areas just to the west and south of the city; the Wampanoag, who still inhabit [[Cape Cod and the Islands]], most of [[Plymouth County, Massachusetts|Plymouth]] and [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol]] counties and south-eastern [[Rhode Island]], including some of the small islands in [[Narragansett Bay]]; the Nauset, who may have rather been an isolated Wampanoag sub-group, inhabited the extreme ends of [[Cape Cod]]; the Coweset of northern Rhode Island and the Pawtucket which covered most of north-eastern [[Massachusetts]] and the lower tributaries of the [[Merrimack River]] and coast of [[New Hampshire]], and the extreme southernmost point of Maine.  Massachusett was also used as a common second language of peoples throughout New England and Long Island, particularly in a simplified pidgin form.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives. 1996. "Introduction." Ives Goddard, ed., The Handbook of North American Indians, Volume 17. Languages, pp. 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The missionary [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] learned the language from bilingual translators and interpreters, and used the Latin alphabet and English-style orthographical conventions in an ''ad hoc'' fashion.  By the 1650s, Eliot had begun translating portions of the Bible, some published, that were distributed to the Indians, and the Indians that learned to read became active agents in the spread of literacy.  Eliot used the dialect of the Massachusett, specifically the speech of Natick.  This caused [[dialect levelling|dialect leveling]] to the ''de facto'' standard, as it was used by Eliot to translate and print the first Bible in the Americas, albeit in the Massachusett tongue.  Several other missionaries fluent in the language offered missionary tracts and translations.  By the 1670s, one in three Indians were literate only twenty years after Eliot's first translations.  As a result of the use of Natick speech and writing, dialectal differences were quickly lost.  The language faded as Indians faced increasing dispossession and assimilation pressures, with the last speakers dying off at the tale end of the nineteenth century.

In 1993, Jessie Little Doe Baird (née Fermino), co-founded the Wopanaak Reclamation Project in an effort to bring the language back to her people, and even studied as a linguist at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] under linguists [[Kenneth Hale]] and later Norvin Richards.  In 2000, at the completion of her studies, Baird introduced a new orthography, still Latin-based, and inspired by the colonial system but represented a one-to-one correlation between sound and spelling.&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the introduction of literacy by the missionary Eliot, the Massachusett-speaking peoples were mainly an orally transmitted culture, with social taboos, mores, customs, legends, history, knowledge and traditions passed from the elders to the next generation through song, stories and discussion.  With peoples from further away, speakers switched to a pidgin variety of Massachusett used across New England, but when spoken language failed, sign language was used.  Little is known about the Eastern Woodlands Algonquian sign language other than its usage.  Lenape were often recruited in the wars with the Indians of the west because of their ability to effectively communicate in silence.  Even [[American Sign Language]] was likely influenced by the sign language of the Wampanoag of Martha's Vineyard, who interacted with a large population of English colonists who were deaf and signed.  [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]] went extinct at the beginning of the twentieth century, but many of its users were influential in the development of ASL.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, E. T. (2002). ''Native New Yorkers: The Legacy of the Algonquin People of New York.'' Tulsa, OK: Council Oak Books. pp. 151-155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nash, J. C. P. (2005). 'Martha's Vineyard Sign Language' in ''Sign Languages of the World: A Comparative Handbook''. Julie Bakken Jepsen, Goedele De Clerck, Sam Lutalo-Kiingi, William B. McGregor (eds.). Boston, MA: Walter de Gruyter, Inc. pp. 608-612.&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of it other than its existence, but it was likely similar in scope and usage such as extant [[Plains Indian Sign Language]].

[[File:Scroll-Hoffman-1885.PNG|thumb|left|Ojibwe ''wiigwaasabak''.  Similar dendroglyphs likely were used by the Indians of New England.]] The most important form of symbolic communication that the Indians employed were [[dendroglyph]]s.  These symbols carved into trees and logs served as boundary markers between tribes, to thank local spirits in the wake of a successful hunt and to record one's whereabouts.  Moravian missionaries in the mid-eighteenth century noted that the Lenape of Pennsylvania and New Jersey would carve animals and etchings onto trees when they camped, and were able to pinpoint the tribe, region or village of symbols that they encountered.  Similarly, the Abenaki peoples of northern New England used etchings on trees to mark paths or drew beaver huts and ponds to mark their trapping areas.  The [[Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing|Mi'kmaq pictographic tradition]] was later converted into a true writing system with adjustments by French missionaries.  These symbols were also painted.  In 1813, residents found a tree carved into the shape of a woman and a child around [[Lake Winnipesaukee]].  Evidence for dendroglyphic picture writing in southern New England is lacking, as most of the trees were felled by the Federal Period, with current forests consisting of secondary growth after farms were abandoned for land in the Great Plains in the end of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Lenik, E. J. (2009). Making Pictures in Stone: American Indian Rock Art of the Northeast. pp. 23-34. Tuscaloosa, AL: University of Alabama Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The markings may have been similar to the ''[[wiigwaasabak]]'' of Ashinaabe (Ojibwe) culture in scope and usage, able to record mnemonically songs related to ritual traditions, meetings between clans, maps and tribal identity.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, W. J. (1891). 'The Mide'wiwin or "Grand Medicine Society" of the Ojibwa' in ''Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1885-1886.'' Washington, D. C.: Government Printing Office. p. 286-289.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nipmuc_Basket_Designs.jpg|thumb|right|Designs such as these were painted or woven into Nipmuc baskets into the 1920s.  The lines represent fields, while the domes represent ''wetus'' with dots representing people.  Arranged in groups, it represents a village and its people.]]Pictographs carved into the rocks date back to the middle Archaic Period, ca. 6000-4000 BC up until a century after colonization.  Most notorious are the etchings on [[Dighton Rock]] in the [[Taunton River]] but also several sites around [[Assawompset Pond]].  The figures depicted on Dighton Rock are similar to those of Bellows Falls, Vermont and other sites across New England.  Most depictions include carved hands, the sun, the moon in various phases, people or spirits, anthropomorphic beings, various native animals, markings similar to the letters 'E,' 'M,' 'X,' and 'I,' slashes an crosses, circles that may represent planetary figures, trees, river courses and figures from shamanic tradition like giants, [[thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbird]]s and [[horned serpent]]s.  During and after colonization, some depict Europeans and ships.  Many are carved near water, and probably because these were sacred sites, commemorated historic agreements or to mark the land.&lt;ref name="Lenik"&gt;Lenik, E. J. (2009). pp. 113-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early adopters of literacy are known to have signed their names with animal symbols related to their tribe, clan or stature.  For a century after English arrival, the Indians continued to mark rocks and trees, and one site in Massachusetts features a large boulder, with depictions of wetus from as far back as 3000 years old, to depictions of ships shortly after the period of English settlement began, and a few drawings and the Latin letters of the owner's name, where a Wampanoag family was present until the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Lenik"/&gt;  As late as the 1920s, Nipmuc women in central Massachusetts, a people closely connected culturally and linguistically with the Massachusett-speaking peoples, still made traditional baskets that were often decorated with woven or painted symbols representing the local landscape, such as the use of domed figures for homes (wetus), dots for people, parallel and diagonal lines to represent plots of land and other symbols whose meaning are lost.  It is unknown whether or not the basketry traditions represent a continuation or have any connection to the earlier petro- and dendroglyph traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Prindle, T. (1994). '[http://www.nativetech.org/weave/nipmucbask/ Nipmuc Splint Basketry].', Nipmuc Indian Association of Connecticut.  Adapted from ''Native splint basketry: A Key into the Language of Woodsplint Baskets'', edited by Russell G. Handsman and Ann McMullen, published in 1987 by the American Archaeological Institute in Washington, CT.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
===Colonial system===
[[File:Algonquian Genesis 1.jpg|thumb|right|Top right corner of the first page of Genesis from the 1663 printing of Eliot's translation of the Bible.  One can see the diacritics and long s that were in use.]]As Eliot listened to the Indians from the Praying Town of Natick, he wrote them according to English orthography, which later developed into the colonial system in use from the 1650s until the mid-nineteenth century.  Eliot used the entire Latin alphabet as used in English at the time, to write the language.

====Accent marks====
Vowels could be marked with the [[acute accent]] ('''&lt;big&gt; ´ &lt;/big&gt;''') or the circumflex ('''&lt;big&gt; ˆ &lt;/big&gt;''') over the vowel.  As a general rule, the acute accent served to mark stress or lengthen a vowel and the circumflex was used to mark nasal vowels.  However, colonial '''''ô''''' was consistently used for /ã/ whereas '''''â''''' was used to mark nasal vowels as well as the long vowel /aː/.  Both the Indians and the English missionaries used these accent marks sparingly, but when they were employed, usage was inconsistent and sometimes interchangeable.

The possible vowels with diacritics include acute accent '''''Á''''', '''''É''''', '''''Í''''', '''''Ó''''' and '''''Ú''''' as well as circumflex accent '''''Â''''', '''''Ê''''', '''''Î''''', '''''Ô''''' and '''''Û'''''.  Only '''''Â''''' and '''''Ô''''' are in common use, the other vowels with circumflexes are only rarely attested and generally used where, prescriptively, an acute accent would be used.&lt;ref name="ellyalphy"&gt;Eliot, J. (1666). ''Indian Grammar Begun.'' Cambridge, MA: Marmaduke Robinson (printer). p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  They do serve as disambiguation, for example, '''''e''''' could represent /ə/ such as in '''''h&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;ttuog''''' ('''''h&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;tuwôk''''') {{IPA|/h&lt;u&gt;ə&lt;/u&gt;təwãk/}}, 'speech,' /iː/ in '''''k&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;n''''' ('''''k&lt;u&gt;ee&lt;/u&gt;n''''') {{IPA|/k&lt;u&gt;iː&lt;/u&gt;n/}}, 'you' or the /j/ in '''''wepitt&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;ash''''', but '''''é''''' always represents /iː/, as in '''''wunn&lt;u&gt;é&lt;/u&gt;kin''''' ('''''wun&lt;u&gt;ee&lt;/u&gt;kun''''') {{IPA|/wən&lt;u&gt;iː&lt;/u&gt;kən/}}, 'it is good.'  At other times, the marks are confusing, as in the case of what would be ('''''awasuw''''') {{IPA|/awasəw/}} in the modern orthography, 'he warms himself,' which was written as '''''auwossu''''', '''''ouwassu''''', '''''âwosu''''' (suggesting {{IPA|/ãwasəw/}}) and '''''auwósu''''' (suggesting {{IPA|/awaːsəw/}}) in the colonial script.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, I. (1990). 'Unhistorical features of massachusett.' J. Fisiak (Ed.), ''Historical Linguistics and Philology: Trends in Linguistics. Studies and Monographs'' [TILSM] (Vol. 46, pp. 228–233). Berlin, Germany: Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Retention of archaic Early Modern English features====
As the Massachusett orthography was first committed to writing just around 1650, based on an adaptation of the Latin alphabet and English orthography, it adopted aspects of [[Early Modern English]] conventions that disappeared in England by the late seventeenth century, but probably lingered a few generations later in the American colonies due to isolation.  Since John Eliot wrote at this time, it was natural that orthographical conventions in use were transferred into Massachusett.  It shares the following features:
* '''S''' has a variant minuscule form, the long s ''''ſ'''' used as '''s''' but word initially or medially.  It is easily confused with '''f''', which in print and handwriting of the time often was written akin to the florin ''''ƒ''''. Although not generally reproduced when discussing the language, either in this article or scholarly literature, most printed and handwritten texts of the English and the Indians would have featured '''ſ''' in place of '''s'''  word-initially or word-medially in the seventeenth century.&lt;br&gt;Early Modern English 'a&lt;u&gt;ſſ&lt;/u&gt;ure' and 'fi&lt;u&gt;ſs&lt;/u&gt;ure' but 'i&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;' vs. Modern 'a&lt;u&gt;ss&lt;/u&gt;ure,' 'ƒi&lt;u&gt;ss&lt;/u&gt;ure and 'i&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;.'&lt;br&gt;Colonial Massachusett '''''wo&lt;u&gt;ſ&lt;/u&gt;ketop''''', '''''Ma&lt;u&gt;ſſ&lt;/u&gt;achu&lt;u&gt;ſ&lt;/u&gt;ett''''' but '''''weyau&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;''''' vs. Modern ('''''wa&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;keetôp'''''), ('''''Muhsachuwu&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;ut''''') and ('''''weeyâw&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;''''').
* '''E''' is often a silent letter at the end of words, and consonants are doubled before it, or final '''k''' is written '''ck'''.&lt;br&gt;Early Modern English 'ſhopp&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;' and 'logick&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;' and Modern English 'shop' and 'logic.'&lt;br&gt;Colonial '''''wompatuck&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;''''' and '''''wampumpeagu&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;''''' and Modern ('''''wôpuhtuq''''') {{IPA|/wãpəhtək/}}, 'snow goose,' and ('''''wôpôpeeak''''') {{IPA|/wãpãpiːak/}}, 'stringed wampum.'
* '''J''' is still considered a consonantal variant of '''I''', and '''I''' replaces '''J''' especially in formal texts word initially.  The end of Early Modern English finally led to its separation as a distinct letter.  In the colonial alphabet, '''J''' is used to represent /tʃ/, /tjᵊ/ and /tʲ/ in native words.&lt;br&gt;Early Modern English '&lt;u&gt;J&lt;/u&gt;ulius' or '&lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt;ulius' and '&lt;u&gt;j&lt;/u&gt;uſt' or '&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;uſt' and Modern '&lt;u&gt;J&lt;/u&gt;ulius' and '&lt;u&gt;j&lt;/u&gt;ust.'&lt;br&gt;Colonial Massachusett '''''wa&lt;u&gt;j&lt;/u&gt;u''''' and '''''nawa&lt;u&gt;j&lt;/u&gt;''''' and Modern ('''''wa&lt;u&gt;ch&lt;/u&gt;8'''''), 'mountain,' and ('''''nuwa&lt;u&gt;ch&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/nəwa&lt;u&gt;tʃ&lt;/u&gt;/}}, 'chief.'
* '''O''' represented the short vowel /ʊ/ in Early Modern English, but this has mostly been replaced by '''U''', e.g., 's&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;mmer' and modern 's&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;mmer,' but common words such as 'some,' 'one,' 'come' and 'love' retain the spelling of Middle English.  In the colonial orthography for Massachusett, '''o''' is usually interchangeable as a symbol for '''a''', thus could represent /a/, /aː/ and /ã/ and even /ə/. &lt;br&gt;Early Modern English 'ſ&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;mmer' vs. 'pl&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;mmes' vs. Modern 's&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;mmer' and 'pl&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;ms' (but still 'one' and 'some' not *'wun' and *'sum')&lt;br&gt;Colonial Massachusett '''''maſqu&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;g''''' and '''''&lt;u&gt;o&lt;/u&gt;htomp''''' vs. Modern ('''''masq&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;k''''') {{IPA|/maskʷ&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;k/}}, 'bears,' and ('''''&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;htôp''''') {{IPA|/&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;htãp/}}, 'bowstring.'
* '''U''' is not yet distinguished from '''V'''.  As a general rule, '''v''' is used initially and '''U''' elsewhere, although in formal texts and book titles, '''V''' was more common.   Although by Eliot's time, the use of '''v''' as a consonant and '''u''' as a vowel was beginning to develop as a general rule, it was still in that transition.  When applied to Massachusett, '''U''' was a vowel and '''V''', its consonantal variant, was used for loan words from English, such as '''''ſil&lt;u&gt;v&lt;/u&gt;er''''' and '''''Jeho&lt;u&gt;v&lt;/u&gt;ah''''', however, were not distinguished as separate letters.
* '''Y''', originally descended from Anglo-Saxon runic '''Þ''', was used to write /θ/ and /ð/.  Although the Normans replaced it with '''th''', the practice of using '''Y''' came from the similarity in certain black letter fonts to '''Y''' (/j/) in use during Middle English.  By Early Modern English, the use of '''Y''' to represent the old letter '''Þ''' '[[thorn (letter)|thorn]],' was fading in print, but remained in handwriting and occasionally in print as a shorthand for '''th''', often with either the letter or the letters after in superscript to distinguish it from '''Y''' (/j/).  Although it was not part of the Massachusett alphabet, it was likely used to spell some loan words from English especially in the early colonial period.&lt;br&gt;Early Modern English '&lt;u&gt;y&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sup&gt;is&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;u&gt;y&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sup&gt;at&lt;/sup&gt;' and 'whi&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;y&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;er &lt;u&gt;&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/u&gt;i&lt;u&gt;&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/u&gt;er' vs. Modern '&lt;u&gt;th&lt;/u&gt;is and &lt;u&gt;th&lt;/u&gt;at' and 'whi&lt;u&gt;th&lt;/u&gt;er &lt;u&gt;th&lt;/u&gt;i&lt;u&gt;th&lt;/u&gt;er.'&lt;br&gt;Colonial Massachusett '''''mon&lt;u&gt;&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''''' and '''''&lt;u&gt;Y&lt;/u&gt;&lt;sup&gt;urſday&lt;/sup&gt;''''' (loans from English).

===Modern system===
[[File:SOUTH FRONT - Old Indian Church, , Mashpee, Barnstable County, MA HABS MASS,1-MASH,1-1.tif|thumb|left|The Old Indian Church and Meetinghouse of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe.  The first literate Indian parishioners used the old colonial orthography, but since the beginning of the twenty-first century, the Mashpee and three other Wampanoag tribes use the modern system developed by the WLRP.]]The modern, phonetic system in use by the ('''''Wôpanâak''''') Language Reclamation Project was first introduced by Baird with her publication of ''An Introduction to Wampanoag Grammar'' in 2000 after the completion of her Master's in Algonquian Linguistics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].  The writing system was based to fit to the phonology of the language.  Baird was easily able to find the vocabulary and Massachusett radicals from the large body of missionary translations and personal letters and records of literate Indians, but pronunciation was pieced together with clues in the early writing as well as application of sound change and other patterns of development from Proto-Algonquian.

====Alphabetic differences====
The most striking feature of the new orthography is substitution of ('''''8''''') for the double-o ligature '''''ꝏ''''' of the colonial period.  This was done to ease inputting, rendering and printing and possibly because of its resemblance to the ou-ligature '''''ȣ''''' used in Algonquin and Abenaki Latin-script orthographies, although the Abenaki have also replaced '''''ȣ''''' with '''''8''''' for similar reasons.  For example, historical '''''mꝏs''''' (Massachusett) and '''''mȣs''''' (Abenaki) and WLRP ('''''m8s''''').  Inspired by the colonial script, the modern orthography uses ('''''â''''') and ('''''ô''''') which resemble '''''A''''' and '''''O''''' with circumflexes, but modern usage restricts the former to represent /aː/ and the latter /ã/ whereas any vowel with a circumflex usually indicated nasality in the colonial script.  These are considered letters in their own respective right, and not vowels with diacritics, in the modern orthographical system.

As the WLRP favors resurrecting old vocabulary, neologisms based on Massachusett radicals or use of forms from other extant languages over the use of English loan words, the new alphabet noticeably lacks the letters '''''F''''', '''''L''''', '''''V''''' and '''''R''''', used only in loan words, as well as '''''B''''', '''''C''''', '''''D''''', '''''G''''', '''''J''''', and '''''Z''''' that were previously used in both loans and native words as alternates to their respective voiced or unvoiced counterparts.&lt;ref name="ellyalphy"/&gt;  Although excluded from the alphabet, these letters are used to write proper names and some loans from English as all speakers and language learners and speakers today are native English speakers in a predominately English-speaking nation. '''''X''''', which mainly appears in rare syncopated versions of native words and English loan words, now only appears in loan words, but was originally used in dialects that allowed for syncopation.

====Exceptions to phonemic spelling====
{{More|Massachusett phonology}}
The Modern orthography lacks the confusing array of multiple, often contradictory, spellings, essentially representing a one-to-one correspondence between sound and spelling.  It lacks gemination (letter doubling), silent E's, letter thorn, excessive English loan words and frustratingly variant spellings of the previous system.

A few exceptions to the general rule exist. ('''''Q''''') as /kʷ/ before vowels and /k/ elsewhere, where ('''''K''''') would be expected.  The reason for this is because it prevents alternations between ('''''Q''''') and ('''''K''''') when medial and final radicals are appended, it would remain ('''''Q''''') before certain ones and ('''''K''''') elsewhere.  For example, in Colonial spelling, the word for 'bear' was '''''moſ&lt;u&gt;k&lt;/u&gt;''''' or '''''moſh&lt;u&gt;k&lt;/u&gt;''''' (but also '''''moſh&lt;u&gt;q&lt;/u&gt;''''' and '''''moſ&lt;u&gt;q&lt;/u&gt;'''''), but when any endings, such as the plural or [[obviative]] endings are attached, '''''Q''''' was always used, often accompanied by '''''U''''', e.g., '''''mas&lt;u&gt;qu&lt;/u&gt;og''''' or '''''mos&lt;u&gt;qu&lt;/u&gt;oh'''''whereas the modern orthography avoids this alteration by using ('''''Q''''') in all cases, with a simple rule to gleam its proper pronunciation, hence modern ('''''mas&lt;u&gt;q&lt;/u&gt;''''') {{IPA|/ma&lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;k/}}, 'bear,' ('''''mas&lt;u&gt;q&lt;/u&gt;ash'''''), 'bears' and ('''''mas&lt;u&gt;q&lt;/u&gt;ah''''') 'bear' (obviative).&lt;ref&gt;Fermino, J. L. D. (2000). pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

('''''TE''''') and the letter ('''''TY''''') produce essentially the same alveo-palatal /tʲ/ sound, although there is a slight difference in their respective origins which is distinguished in the orthography.  The letter ('''''TY''''') represents palatization of /k/, which occurs when /k/ is followed by /ə/, if that /ə/ is etymologically a weakened form of PEA *ī, which is in turn followed by either /hp/, /p/, /m/, /hk/ or /k/. Palatization is also triggered when /k/ is followed by /aː/, which derives from PEA *ē, and /əw/, which remains unchanged from PEA *əw.  For example, ('''''wee&lt;u&gt;k&lt;/u&gt;uw'''''), 'it is his/her house,' vs. ('''''wee&lt;u&gt;ty&lt;/u&gt;8'''''), 'house,' both derive from Proto-Algonquian *'''''wi·&lt;u&gt;k&lt;/u&gt;iw[a·ʔmi]''''' and ('''''sô&lt;u&gt;ty&lt;/u&gt;um''''') from Proto-Algonquian *'''''sa·&lt;u&gt;k&lt;/u&gt;ima·wa'''''.&lt;ref name="recovery"/&gt;

('''''TE''''') is actually ('''''T''''') followed by ('''''E'''''), the latter is used to represent vowel affection.  In Massachusett, this involves /j/-insertion before vowels that follow /iː/ or /ə/ but after /n/, /h/, /t/ or /ht/.&lt;ref&gt;Ferminio, J. L. D. (2000). p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, ('''''weeput&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;ash''''') {{IPA|/wiːpətjᵊaʃ/}}, 'his teeth.'  In both cases, the /ə/ descends etymologically from Proto-Eastern Algonquian /iː/.  Although similar, infection often occurs as a replacement for a vowel that was once present.  For instance, Massachusett ('''''weeput&lt;u&gt;e&lt;/u&gt;ash''''') descends from Proto-Algonquian *'''''wi·pit&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;ari'''''.  ('''''E''''') is used similarly to the Colonial orthography, where '''''E''''' was used in analogous positions.  Although ('''''E''''') is taken as /j/, most current speakers, and likely historical speakers, pronounce it as /jᵊ/ which is represented here.

The colonial orthography used the ligature letter '''''ꝏ''''' generally represented /uː/ but was also used in place of /wə/ and /əw/, whereas these sounds are represented in the modern orthography as ('''''8'''''), ('''''wu''''') and ('''''uw'''''), respectively.  In rapid speech, /uː/ and /əw/ can be confused, for example, Colonial '''''hettꝏonk''''' vs. Modern ('''''hutuwôk''''') {{IPA|/hətəwãk/}}, 'speech.'&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, N. (2006). p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released on July 11, 2008, received generally negative reviews and grossed $50 million against its $60 million budget.

==Plot==
In his [[New York City]] apartment, a young boy named Josh Morrison (Austyn Lind Myers) stares through his telescope at an object falling from the sky. It is a golf-ball-sized metal ball which flies through the window and lands in his fishbowl, quickly draining the water along with the goldfish. He decides to show it at his school's science class presentation.

Some months later a massive fireball crashes into the water near [[Liberty Island]]. It is revealed to be a spaceship which resembles a human ([[Eddie Murphy]]), controlled by 100 tiny humanoid aliens. Its Captain (also played by Murphy) pilots the spaceship from the command deck located in its head, with the help of his second-in-command Number 2 ([[Ed Helms]]), and researcher Number 3 ([[Gabrielle Union]]). The spaceship looks very human, and displays numerous superpowers, but the aliens don't know how to make the "ship" act like a human. A superstitious cop named Dooley ([[Scott Caan]]) desperately searches for the alien.

The aliens need to save their planet, Nil, from an energy crisis. They need salt, which they plan to take by draining the Earth's [[ocean]]s using the metal ball, so they have to recover the ball. After the spaceship is hit by Josh's single mother, Gina Morrison ([[Elizabeth Banks]]), while driving, the Captain decides to befriend Gina and Josh. He tells them his name is Dave Ming Chang, based on a quick scan of common Earth names. At Gina's home the crew see their missing ball in a photograph taken at the science presentation. After having breakfast with Gina, "Dave" goes to Josh's school where he pretends to be a substitute teacher and eventually is able to talk to Josh alone. Josh tells him that the ball was taken from him by a bully (Nicholas Berman). With Josh's help, Dave takes the metal ball back from the bully.

The Captain (via Dave) spends some time with Josh and Gina and realizes that humans are more advanced than they originally thought. The crew observes humans displaying feelings and love, such as witnessing Gina's painting or a homeless man offering to share his blanket with Dave when he sleeps in a doorway. The Captain decides to cancel the plan to drain the oceans because it would destroy life on Earth. The police track Dave down using the impression of his face found in the dirt at the crash site and they arrest him. After spending so much time on Earth, most of the crew begin to exhibit new "feelings", adopting Earth's culture, mannerisms and general laid-back attitude. Number 2 decides that the Captain and the rest of the crew's changing behavior is unacceptable and takes command of the "ship", imprisoning the Captain. Under Number 2's command, Dave breaks out of the police station and another attempt is made to arrest him. Number 3, who has become infatuated with the Captain, becomes jealous of Gina. She first cooperates in the command change but later agrees with the Captain's view on humans. Both are caught by Number 2 and they are expelled from the spaceship. In the meantime, Number 17 ([[Kevin Hart (actor)|Kevin Hart]]),  a young, fun-loving alien, jumps out of the "ship" while [[Drunkenness|drunk]] from the alcohol Dave has imbibed. The Captain apologizes to Number 3 for ignoring her. He admits that he too loves her and wants to be with her. Back at the police station, Dooley discovers Number 17 in his coffee and interrogates him to find out where Dave is going.

Number 2 takes Dave to the harbor, where he tries to throw the metal orb into the ocean, but is stopped by the Captain and Number 3, both of whom managed to gain reentry back onto the ship. They convince the rest of the crew that the real Captain is in charge again. Reinstated, he orders Number 2 to be stuck in the ship's "butt" forever. The metal orb meanwhile slips out of Dave's hand and rolls into the ocean. The Captain attempts to retrieve the orb but is told that they only have enough power to either retrieve it or return home. The Captain decides to save the Earth and the rest of the crew agrees. The ball, thrown in the ocean by Number 2, is retrieved. Dave powers down while Dooley and his partner catch up and point their guns at him. With no power, Dave's shields are disabled, leaving the crew defenseless. Josh tries to tell the police officers that Dave is harmless but is ignored. He then grabs Dooley's taser which he uses on Dave, recharging him. The Captain and Number 3 reveal themselves to the police officers who stand down. The Captain says goodbye to Josh and Gina saying he now understands love. Number 17 is then returned to Dave by Dooley. About to fly away, a team from the FBI arrives and throws a net over Dave. While the FBI agents wrestle the body down, "Dave's" crew evacuates to one of the ship's "lifeboat" shoes, activate the engines, detaches the shoe and heads home to Nil, leaving behind both the ship and Number 2. While in the lifeboat, the Captain asks for Number 3's hand in marriage. She accepts and they kiss.

==Production==
[[File:MeetDaveFilmSetJun07.jpg|thumb|right|Film set at the [[Statue of Liberty]] in June 2007.]]
Screenwriter [[Bill Corbett]] originally pitched the story for SciFi.com, the website for the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]], which previously aired ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', where Corbett worked as a writer and actor. The concept was eventually dropped and Corbett, along with other MST3K alumni, instead developed the online mini-series ''[[Edward the Less|The Adventures of Edward the Less]]'' for the site. Corbett later revived the idea for a movie and discussed it with friend and fellow writer [[Rob Greenberg]], who would become his screenwriting partner for the project. Although both writers acknowledged several other "little people inside big people"&lt;ref name="Rifftrax"&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Bill Corbett | last= Corbett | first= Bill] | url = http://blog.rifftrax.com/2008/07/10/meat-dave/ | title = Meat, Dave? | work = [[RiffTrax]] | date = July 10, 2008 | accessdate = 2009-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; movies had been made in the past, Corbett thought the aspect of an entire ''[[Star Trek]]'' like crew operating a human being bore some originality.&lt;ref name="Rifftrax" /&gt;

During filming, ''Meet Dave'' was transferred from [[Paramount Pictures]] (which released many of Murphy's early films) to [[20th Century Fox]] (which released ''[[Dr. Dolittle (film)|Dr. Dolittle]]'').&lt;ref name="Rifftrax" /&gt;

''Meet Dave'' was written under the title ''Starship Dave'', but studio executives insisted on a title change in part because of the poor box office performance of ''[[The Adventures of Pluto Nash]]'', a 2002 science-fiction comedy that also starred [[Eddie Murphy]]. Corbett said the executives also wanted the title changed because they felt having any semblance of science-fiction in the title would isolate a large percentage of audiences. Corbett unsuccessfully argued against changing the title, which he described as "beyond generic" and said was repetitive of a comedy released earlier in the year called ''[[Meet Bill]]''.&lt;ref name="Rifftrax" /&gt;

Although the project as it was originally conceived appealed to both children and slightly older audiences, the final script aimed for a much more solidly family-based audience. Corbett and Greenberg wrote the original draft and some subsequent drafts and, although they were given the sole writing credit, Corbett said other writers "have romped through the script as well,"&lt;ref name="Rifftrax" /&gt; including one unnamed writer who spent one week adding material after the final draft was submitted. A large amount of improvising and rewriting was also done on the set, and Corbett and Greenberg had little creative control during filming. Corbett said most of the people they worked with were pleasant and some of the notes from the studio were helpful, but that ''Meet Dave'' ultimately suffered from a "too-many-cooks thing."&lt;ref name="Rifftrax" /&gt;

Filming was expected to begin in March 2007. As of early June, they were filming scenes at the Statue of Liberty in [[New York City]]. There was also some filming in early 2007 at an elementary school in Pasadena, California.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

'''''Meet Dave: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''' was composed by [[John Debney]] and released by [[Varèse Sarabande]]. He recorded his score with the [[Hollywood Studio Symphony]] at the Newman Scoring Stage in February 2008.&lt;ref name=scoring&gt;{{cite news|author=Dan Goldwasser|url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/126|title=John Debney scores ''Starship Dave''|publisher=ScoringSessions.com|date=February 19, 2008|accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Meet Dave'' began receiving criticism and virulence months before it was actually released, especially by die-hard film fans Corbett compared to the [[Comic Book Guy]] character in ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Greenberg enjoyed reading the negative comments on the [[Internet Movie Database]], whereas Corbett said he would "rather take an acid bath"&lt;ref name="Rifftrax" /&gt; than read them. Corbett, who did not see the final film until after it was widely released, said he did not know how the final result would come out:

{{quote|Part of me is proud and wants to own this movie, promote it, generally celebrate it and look forward to all the possibilities that may emerge from the experience. And an equally real part of me wants to lock myself in a dark room for a month and pretend it never happened. Why the latter? Because the truth is that I had not a bit of control over the final product, and Hollywood does tend to suckify things. Often quite badly.&lt;ref name="Rifftrax" /&gt;}}

Murphy skipped the ''Meet Dave'' premiere because he was working on the (subsequently-delayed) comedy ''[[A Thousand Words (film)|A Thousand Words]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20211232,00.html | title = Eddie Murphy Misses His Movie Premiere | work = ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' | date = July 9, 2008 | accessdate = 2009-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Screenwriter Bill Corbett also missed the premiere, which he said was due to family plans, "not an act of protest, per se".&lt;ref name="Rifftrax" /&gt;

===Box office===
''Meet Dave'' grossed $11.8 million in the United States and Canada and $38.8 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $50.7 million, against its production budget of $60 million.

The film opened on July 11, 2008, in 3,011 theaters in North America and grossed $5.3 million, ranking seventh at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=meetdave.htm | title=Meet Dave (2008) - Weekend Box Office Results |publisher= IMDB | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20th Century Fox distribution executive Bert Livingston said, "It was a tough concept to get across. It's upsetting for all of us and for Eddie. He's very funny in this. Just not enough people came."&lt;ref name=demon&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/07/13/boxoffice.ap/index.html |title=Demon rakes in millions at box office |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=July 13, 2008 |accessdate=2007-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080716085622/http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/07/13/boxoffice.ap/index.html |archivedate=July 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its third weekend, it broke the record for the highest number of theater drops for a film in wide release, losing 2,523 theaters (77%). It held the record until ''[[Live by Night (film)|Live by Night]]'' was dropped from 2,659 theaters (94.1%) in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/theaterdrops.htm | title = Biggest Theater Drops | work = [[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher = IMDB }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film an approval rating of 19% based on 101 reviews, with an average rating of 4.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Easy gags and slack direction drag this occasionally clever alien-out-of-planet comedy down to unimaginative lows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= [[Flixster]] | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |title=Meet Dave (2008) |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/meet_dave/ | accessdate=2016-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], gave the film a score of 43 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".

The film's poor performance became a joke for comedians. [[Jay Leno]] said that the film's title was going to be changed to ''Meet Dave: At Blockbuster'', insinuating that the movie should have been a straight-to-DVD release.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In the also Fox-produced ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Friends of Peter G]]", during the "Mr. Booze" song number, Carl mentioned that since he started drinking, he has never left his couch and has seen every movie ever made. ''Meet Dave'' is the first movie called out, and Carl mentions he has seen it.

Bill Corbett said he would love to record a ''Meet Dave'' track on [[RiffTrax]], a site featuring downloadable audio commentaries recorded by ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' alum [[Michael J. Nelson]] and other regular commentators, including Corbett. Corbett said the track was not likely to ever be recorded since comedies rarely work as spoofs.&lt;ref name="Rifftrax" /&gt; A reference to the film was included in the RiffTrax Presents commentary for ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' recorded by [[Matthew J. Elliott]] (in which he suggested that the filmmaker's original intention had been to launch [[Charlton Heston]]'s character into space inside a giant [[Eddie Murphy]]), as well as the commentary for ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'' recorded by Corbett and [[Kevin Murphy (actor)|Kevin Murphy]], in which Corbett claims the natural phenomena hitting Los Angeles were "almost as big a Hollywood disaster as ''Meet Dave''{{'}}s box office".

{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}} 
It was nominated for two [[Razzie Awards]], Worst Actor (Eddie Murphy) and Worst Screen Couple (Eddie Murphy ''in'' Eddie Murphy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.razzies.com/history/29thNoms.asp|title=RAZZIES.COM® 2008 Nominations|work=razzies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Moorish Science Temple of America''' is an American national and religious organization founded by [[Noble Drew Ali]]. He based it on the premise that [[African Americans]] are descendants of the [[Moab]]ites and thus are [[Moors|Moorish]] by nationality, and [[Islam]]ic by faith. Ali put together elements of major traditions to develop a message of personal transformation through historical education, racial pride and spiritual uplift. His doctrine was also intended to provide African Americans with a sense of identity in the world and to promote civic involvement.

One primary tenet of the Moorish Science Temple is the belief that African Americans are of Moorish ancestry, specifically from the "Moroccan Empire." According to Ali, this area included other countries that today surround Morocco. To join the movement, individuals had to proclaim their "Moorish nationality." They were given "nationality cards." In religious texts, adherents refer to themselves racially as "Asiatics," as the Middle East is also western Asia.&lt;ref&gt;''The Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America,'' Chapter XXV - "A Holy Covenant of the Asiatic Nation"&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of this movement are known as "Moorish-American Moslems" and are called "Moorish Scientists" in some circles.

The Moorish Science Temple of America was incorporated under the Illinois Religious Corporation Act 805 ILCS 110. Timothy Drew, known to its members as [[Prophet]] Noble Drew Ali, founded the Moorish Science Temple of America in 1913 in [[Newark, New Jersey]], a booming industrial city.  After some difficulties, Ali moved to [[Chicago]], establishing a center there, as well as temples in other major cities. The movement expanded rapidly during the late 1920s.  The quick expansion of the Moorish Science Temple arose in large part from the search for identity and context among black Americans at the time of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to northern and midwestern cities, as they were becoming an urbanized people.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, pg. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Competing factions developed among the congregations and leaders, especially after the death of the charismatic Ali. Three independent organizations developed from this ferment. The founding of the [[Nation of Islam]] by [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]] in 1930 also created competition for members.  In the 1930s membership was estimated at 30,000, with one third in Chicago. During the [[postwar]] years, the Moorish Science Temple of America continued to increase in membership, albeit at a slower rate.

==Biography of Drew==
[[File:Nobledrew.jpg|thumb|200px|Noble Drew Ali]]
Timothy Drew was believed to have been born on January 8, 1886 in [[North Carolina]], United States.&lt;ref name="Gomez"&gt;Wilson, p. 15; Gomez, p. 203; Paghdiwala; Gale Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Sources differ as to his background and upbringing: one reports he was the son of two former [[slaves]] who was adopted by a tribe of [[Cherokee]];&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; another describes Drew as the son of a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] Muslim father and a Cherokee mother.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez and Paghdiwala give both versions.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 an article in the online ''Journal of Race Ethnicity and Religion'' attempted to link Timothy Drew to one Thomas Drew, born January 8, 1886, using census records, a World War I draft card, and street directory records.&lt;ref name="Abdat"&gt;F. Abdat, "Before the Fez-Life and Times of Drew Ali", ''Journal of Race Ethnicity and Religion'', Vol 5, No 8, August 2014 [http://www.raceandreligion.com/JRER/Volume_5_(2014)_files/Abdat%205%208.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding of the Moorish Science Temple==
Drew Ali reported that during his travels, he met with a high priest of [[Egypt]]ian magic. In one version of Drew Ali's biography, the leader saw him as a reincarnation of the founder. In others, he claims that the priest considered him a reincarnation of [[Jesus]], the [[Buddha]], [[Muhammad]] and other religious prophets. According to the biography, the high priest trained Ali in [[mysticism]] and gave him a "lost section" of the [[Quran]].

This text came to be known as the ''Holy Koran of the Moorish Science Temple of America'' (not to be confused with the Islamic ''[[Quran]]''). It is also known as the "''Circle Seven Koran''" because of its cover, which features a red "7" surrounded by a blue circle. The first 19 chapters are from ''[[The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ]],'' published in 1908 by esoteric Ohio [[preacher]] [[Levi Dowling]]. In ''The Aquarian Gospel'', Dowling described Jesus's supposed travels in [[India]], [[Egypt]], and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the years of his life which are not accounted for by the New Testament.

Chapters 20 through 45 are borrowed from the [[Rosicrucian]] work, ''Unto Thee I Grant'' with minor changes in style and wording. They are instructions on how to live, and the education and duties of adherents.&lt;ref name=Ghaneabassiri&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Kambiz GhaneaBassiri|Ghaneabassiri]]|first1=[[Kambiz GhaneaBassiri|Kambiz]]|title=A History of Islam in America: From the New World to the New World Order|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521614870|page=220|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q2CYfNrGvI0C&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=%22+Moorish+science+Temple%22++koran&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwim_sTun9vJAhUBhhoKHWJyCWoQ6AEIPjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20Moorish%20science%20Temple%22%20%20koran&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drew Ali wrote the last four chapters of the Circle Seven Koran himself. In these he wrote:

{{Quote|text= The fallen sons and daughters of the Asiatic Nation of North America need to learn to love instead of hate; and to know of their higher self and lower self. This is the uniting of the Holy Koran of Mecca for teaching and instructing all Moorish Americans, etc. The key of civilization was and is in the hands of the Asiatic nations. The Moorish, who were the ancient Moabites, and the founders of the Holy City of Mecca.}}

Drew Ali and his followers used this material to claim, "Jesus and his followers were Asiatic." ("Asiatic" was the term Drew Ali used for all dark or olive-colored people; he labeled all whites as European. He suggested that all Asiatics should be allied.)&lt;ref name="caliber.ucpress.net"&gt;[http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/rac.2002.12.2.123 Nance, Susan.

Drew Ali crafted Moorish Science from a variety of sources, a "network of alternative spiritualities that focused on the power of the individual to bring about personal transformation through mystical knowledge of the divine within".&lt;ref name="caliber.ucpress.net"/&gt; In the inter-war years in Chicago and other major cities, he used these concepts to preach [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racial pride]] and uplift. His approach appealed to thousands of African Americans who had left severely oppressive conditions in the South through the Great Migration and faced struggles in new urban environments.&lt;ref name="caliber.ucpress.net"/&gt;

==Practices and beliefs==
Ali believed that African Americans were all [[Moors]], whom he claimed were descended from the ancient Moabites (describing them as belonging to Northwest Africa as opposed to [[Moab]] as the name suggests).&lt;ref name="Nuruddin"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Yusuf Nuruddin|editor1-last=Hadda|editor1-first=Yvonne Yazbeck|editor2-last=Esposito|editor2-first=John L.|title=Muslims on the Americanization Path?|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198030928|page=223|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SrV5dI0Z3koC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=%22drew+ali%22+Moabites++%22Northwest+Africa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjY-Pn-26_aAhUCOsAKHeMNDGQQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22drew%20ali%22%20Moabites%20%20%22Northwest%20Africa%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 April 2018|language=en|chapter=African-American Muslims and the Question of Identity: Between Traditional Islam, African Heritage, and the American Way|quote=Hence it is in the Moorish Science Temple that we encounter fables about the "ancient Moabite kingdom now known as Morocco, which existed in northwest Amexem. which is now known as northwest Africa."}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that Islam and its teachings are more beneficial to their earthly salvation, and that their 'true nature' had been 'withheld' from them. In the traditions he founded, male members of the Temple wear a [[fez]] or [[turban]] as head covering; women wear a turban.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/search?q=moorish+science+temple+of+america+los+angeles&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbuaHX5ZXVAhVCyVQKHRynBOwQ_AUICCgD&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=635#imgrc=wUsA0euXyhnhFM:&lt;/ref&gt;

They added the suffixes [[Bey]] or El to their surnames, to signify Moorish heritage as well as their taking on the new life as Moorish Americans. It was also a way to claim and proclaim a new identity over that lost to the slavery of their ancestors. These suffixes were a clear sign to others that while one's African tribal name may never be known to him/her, acceptance of European names given by slave masters were not theirs, either.

As Drew Ali began his version of teaching the Moorish-Americans to become better citizens, he made speeches like, "A Divine Warning By the Prophet for the Nations", in which he urged them to reject derogatory labels, such as "Black", "colored", and "Negro". He urged Americans of all races to reject hate and embrace love. He believed that Chicago would become a second [[Mecca]].

The ushers of the Temple wore black fezzes. The leader of a particular temple was known as a Grand [[Islamic clergy|Sheik]], or Governor. Noble Drew Ali  had several wives.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'' (1929) and ''Chicago Defender'' (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''Chicago Defender'', he claimed the power to marry and divorce at will.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Defender'' (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Noble Drew Ali surrounded by Chicago's top politicians..jpg|thumb|right|Noble Drew Ali (top center) with Chicago Alderman Louis B. Anderson (to his right) and Congressman [[Oscar De Priest]] (left)]]

===Early history===
In 1913, Drew Ali formed the Canaanite Temple in [[Newark, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Paghdiwala, p.  23.&lt;/ref&gt; He left the city after agitating people with his views on race.&lt;ref name="Paghdiwala"&gt;Paghdiwala&lt;/ref&gt; Drew Ali and his followers migrated, while planting congregations in [[Philadelphia]]; [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Detroit]]. Finally, Drew Ali settled in [[Chicago]] in 1925, saying [[the Midwest]] was "closer to Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p.  29.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he officially registered Temple No. 9.

There he instructed followers not to be confrontational but to build up their people to be respected. In this way, they might take their place in the United States by developing a cultural identity that was congruent with Drew Ali's beliefs on personhood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kzm4-D1-ODQC&amp;printsec=copyright&amp;source=gbs_pub_info_s&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Gomez, Michael A. (2005) ''Black Crescent: The Experience and Legacy of African Muslims in the Americas''], Cambridge University Press, p.  219, accessed 29 Aug 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s, journalists estimated the Moorish Science Temple had 35,000 members in 17 temples in cities across the Midwest and upper South.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', May 14, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; It was reportedly studied and watched by the Chicago police.

Building Moorish-American businesses was part of their program, and in that was similar to [[Marcus Garvey]]'s [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] and the later Nation of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kzm4-D1-ODQC&amp;printsec=copyright&amp;source=gbs_pub_info_s&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Gomez, Michael A. (2005) ''Black Crescent: The Experience and Legacy of African Muslims in the Americas''], Cambridge University Press, p.  260, accessed 29 Aug 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1928, members of the Moorish Science Temple of America had obtained some respectability within Chicago and Illinois, as they were featured prominently and favorably in the pages of the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', an African American newspaper, and conspicuously collaborated with African American politician and businessman Daniel Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;Nance (2002), p.  635–637&lt;/ref&gt;

Drew Ali attended the January 1929 inauguration of [[Louis L. Emmerson]], as 27th [[Governor of Illinois]] in the state capital of [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]]. The ''Chicago Defender'' stated that his trip included "interviews with many distinguished citizens from Chicago, who greeted him on every hand."&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Defender'', January 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; With the growth in its population and membership, Chicago was established as the center of the movement.

=== Internal split and murder ===
In early 1929, following a conflict over funds, Claude Green-Bey, the business manager of Chicago Temple No. 1 split from the Moorish Science Temple of America. He declared himself Grand Sheik and took a number of members with him. On March 15, Green-Bey was stabbed to death at the Unity Hall of the Moorish Science Temple, on Indiana Avenue in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune''&lt;/ref&gt;

Drew Ali was out of town at the time, as he was dealing with former Supreme Grand Governor Lomax Bey (professor Ezaldine Muhammad), who had supported Green-Bey's attempted coup.&lt;ref&gt;Gale.&lt;/ref&gt; When Drew Ali returned to Chicago, the police arrested him and other members of the community on suspicion of having instigated the killing. No indictment was sworn for Drew Ali at that time.

===The death of Drew Ali===
Shortly after his release by the police, Drew Ali died at age 43 at his home in Chicago on July 20, 1929.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chicago Defender]]'', July 27, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exact circumstances of his death are unknown, the Certificate of Death stated that Noble Drew Ali died from "[[tuberculosis]] broncho-[[pneumonia]]".&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, p. 186, as well as other less reputable sources.  Perkins cites "Standard Certificate of Deatch No. 22054, Timothy Drew, issued July 25, 1929, Office of Cook County Clerk, Cook County, Illinois".  The certificate was filed by Dr. Clarence Payne-El, who was reportedly at Drew Ali's bedside when he died.  See also Scopino.&lt;/ref&gt;   Despite the official report, many of his followers speculated that his death was caused by injuries from the police or from other members of the faith.&lt;ref&gt;McCloud, p. 18; Wilson, p.  35. The ''Chicago Defender'', whose news articles had turned critical, said that "it is believed that the ordeal of the trial together with the treatment he received at the hands of police in an effort to obtain true statements are directly responsible for the illness which precipitated his death" (July 27, 1929).&lt;/ref&gt; Others thought it was due to pneumonia. One Moor told the ''Chicago Defender'', "The Prophet was not ill; his work was done and he laid his head upon the lap of one of his followers and passed out."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Paghdiwala, p. 24. Also quoted by Nance (2002, p.  659, note 84) with a reference to "Cult Leader Dies; Was in Murder Case", ''Chicago Defender'', July 27, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hold Final Rites for Moorish Chief", ''Chicago Defender'', August 3, 1929, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Succession and schism===
[[File:Sheik Edward Mealy El, Moorish Science Temple.png|thumb|200px|Grand Sheik [[E. Mealy El]] in an undated photo, ca. 1928.]]

The death of Drew Ali brought out a number of candidates to succeed him.  Brother [[Edward Mealy El]] stated that he had been declared Drew Ali's successor by Drew Ali himself.  In August, within a month of Drew Ali's death, [[John Givens El]], Drew Ali's chauffeur, declared that he was Drew Ali reincarnated.  He is said to have fainted while working on Drew Ali's automobile and "the sign of the star and crescent [appeared] in his eyes".&lt;ref&gt;The story of Givens fainting appears, among other places, in Gomez, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the September Unity Conference, Givens again made his claim of reincarnation.  However, the governors of the Moorish Science Temple of America declared [[Charles Kirkman Bey]] to be the successor to Drew Ali and named him Grand Advisor.&lt;ref&gt;McCloud, p. 18. Gardell, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the support of several temples each, Mealy El and Givens El both went on to lead separate factions of the Moorish Science Temple. All three factions (Kirkman Bey, Mealy El, and Givens El) are active today.

On September 25, 1929, Kirkman Bey's wife reported to the Chicago police his apparent kidnapping by one Ira Johnson. Accompanied by two Moorish Science members, the police visited the home of Johnson, when they were met by gunfire. The attack escalated into a shoot-out that spilled into the surrounding neighborhood. In the end, a policeman as well as a member were killed in the gun battle, and a second policeman later died of his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odmp.org/officer/6835-patrolman-jesse-d.-hults "Patrolmen Jesse D. Hults and William Gallagher"], Officer Down Memorial Page&lt;/ref&gt; The police took 60 people into police custody, and a reported 1000 police officers patrolled the Chicago [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] that evening.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', September 1929. ''Washington Post'', September 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson and two others were later convicted of murder.&lt;ref&gt;''Hartford Courant'', April 19, 1930, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirkman Bey went on to serve as Grand Advisor of one of the most important factions until 1959, when the reins were given to F. Nelson-Bey.

===Nation of Islam===
The community was further split when [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]], known within the temple as [[David Ford-el|David Ford El]],&lt;ref&gt;Prashad, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; also claimed (or was taken by some) to be the reincarnation of Drew Ali.&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom (p. 1067), Abu Shouk (p. 147), Hamm (p. 14), and Lippy (p. 214) all state that Fard claimed to be, or was considered by many Moors to be, the reincarnation of Drew Ali.  According to Turner (p. 92), Ford El, also known as Abdul Wali Farad Muhammad Ali, unsuccessfully challenged Drew Ali in Newark in 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; When his leadership was rejected, Ford El broke away from the Moorish Science Temple. He moved to Detroit, where he formed his own group, an organization that would become the [[Nation of Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom (p. 1067), Lippy (p. 214), Miyakawa (p. 12).&lt;/ref&gt; The Nation of Islam denied any historical connection with the Moorish Science Temple until February 26, 2014, when [[Louis Farrakhan]] acknowledged the contribution(s) of Noble Drew Ali to the Nation of Islam and their founding principles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/Minister_Louis_Farrakhan_9/article_101236.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1930s===
Despite the turmoil and defections, the movement continued to grow in the 1930s. It is estimated that membership in the 1930s reached 30,000. There were major congregations in Philadelphia, Detroit, and Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Paghdiwala, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

One-third of the members, or 10,000, lived in Chicago, the center of the movement. There were congregations in numerous other cities where African Americans had migrated in the early 20th century. The group published several magazines: one was the ''Moorish Guide National''. During the 1930s and 1940s, continued surveillance by police (and later the [[FBI]]) caused the Moors to become more withdrawn and critical of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Nance, p. 659.&lt;/ref&gt;

===FBI surveillance===
During the 1940s, the Moorish Science Temple (specifically the Kirkman Bey faction) came to the attention of the [[FBI]], who investigated claims of members committing subversive activities by adhering to and spreading of Japanese propaganda. The investigation failed to find any substantial evidence, and the investigations were dropped. The federal agency later investigated the organization in 1953 for violation of the [[Selective Service Act of 1948]] and [[sedition#United States|sedition]]. In September 1953, the Department of Justice determined that prosecution was not warranted for the alleged violations. The file that the FBI created on the temple grew to 3,117 pages during its lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moorish Science Temple of America|url=http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/moortemp.htm|website=FBI FOIA Archive|publisher=FBI|accessdate=11 May 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305065613/http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/moortemp.htm|archivedate=5 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They never found any evidence of any connection or much sympathy of the temple's members for Japan.

===El Rukn connection===
In 1976 [[Jeff Fort]], leader of Chicago's [[Black P Stone Nation]], announced at his parole from prison in 1976 that he had converted to Islam. Moving to [[Milwaukee]], Fort associated himself with the Moorish Science Temple of America. It is unclear whether he officially joined or was instead rejected by its members.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (p. 167) says Fort did join the Milwaukee temple. Hamm (p. 25) states otherwise: "Fort tried to join the Moorish Science Temple in Milwaukee but Temple elders refused to have him."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Fort returned to Chicago and changed the name of his gang to ''El Rukn'' ("the foundation" in Arabic), also known as "Circle Seven El Rukn Moorish Science Temple of America"&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Tribune'', "El Rukn street gang joins drive to register voters", August 25, 1982, p.  17.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Moorish Science Temple, El Rukn tribe".&lt;ref&gt;Shipp, ''New York Times'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars are divided over the nature of the relationship, if any, between ''El Rukn'' and the Moorish Science Temple of America.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, et al. (p.  335) says that "The Moorish Science Temple of America has always denied such a connection."&lt;br /&gt;See also Nashashibi ("In 1982 the El Rukns dropped their affiliation with the Moorish Science Temple of America and moved closer toward a more orthodox understanding of Sunni Islam.")&lt;br /&gt;See also the 1988 court case, ''Johnson-Bey et al. v. Lane et al.'' ("The sinister El Rukn group is a breakaway faction from the Moorish Science Temple of America … apparently it no longer has any connection with the Moorish Science Temple.").&lt;/ref&gt; Fort reportedly hoped that an apparent affiliation with a religious organization would discourage law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Main, ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1980===
[[File:Moorish Science Temple, N Hoyne, Chicago 1.JPG|thumb|Temple No 9, in Chicago, Illinois]]

In 1984 the Chicago congregation bought a building from [[Buddhist]] [[monks]] in [[Ukrainian Village, Chicago|Ukrainian Village]], which continues to be used for Temple No. 9. Demographic and cultural changes have decreased the attraction of young people to the Moorish Science Temple. Only about 200 members attended a convention in 2007, rather than the thousands of the past. In the early 2000s, the temples in Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Washington, D.C. had about 200 members each, and many were older people.&lt;ref name="chicagoreader.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Aging of the Moors |first=Tasneem |last=Paghdiwala |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-aging-of-the-moors/Content?oid=999633 |newspaper=[[Chicago Reader]] |volume=37 |issue=8 |date=November 15, 2007 |accessdate=October 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-first century===
:''See [[Sovereign citizen movement]] and [[Washitaw Nation]]''

An increasing number of people claiming to follow Moorish Science have filed false legal documents in various municipalities around the United States. The documents include fake [[lien]]s, deeds, and property claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinback|first=Robert|title=Judge Ignores 'Martian law,' Tosses 'Sovereign Citizen' Into Slammer|url=http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2011/07/20/judge-ignores-martian-law-tosses-sovereign-citizen-into-slammer/|accessdate=9 September 2012|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Moorish Science Temple has disavowed any affiliation with those filing the false documents, calling them "radical and subversive fringe groups".&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], "Bogus court filings cast unwanted spotlight on little-known U.S. sect", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 22 August 2011, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

TAO facilitates research collaborations and the exchange of research materials by use of a [[Material Transfer Agreement]] or other types of technology transfer agreements between NIDDK and the global scientific community by developing research partnerships.  Unlike most technology transfer and development offices, TAO also helps NIDDK inventors advance their technologies through preclinical development.
 
Technology transfer is the process by which basic science research and fundamental discoveries are developed into practical and commercially relevant applications and products. TAO is committed to transferring its technologies and research resources to external organizations for further research, development and/or commercialization to create biomedical products and services that benefit public health. TAO's staff members have been drawn from industry as well as other external organizations to provide a remarkable variety of skills to assist potential research partners. TAO staff evaluate and manage invention portfolios, oversee patent prosecution, negotiate licensing agreements and review cooperative research agreements.

== Purpose and background ==

The function of [[technology transfer]] is a process by which technology developed in one organization, in any one particular area and purpose, is applied in another organization, in another area, or for another purpose. Simply put, NIDDK TAO facilitates the movement of technology from the federal laboratories to industry and to state and local governments in order to maximize results of ongoing Federal research endeavors. 

'''The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csrees.usda.gov/about/offices/legis/techtran.html/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008124126/http://www.csrees.usda.gov/about/offices/legis/techtran.html/ |date=October 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; established the foundation for technology transfer within the Federal government. This law recognized the need for enhanced information dissemination from the Federal government to private industry. It also required Federal laboratories to take a more active role in cooperation with potential users of federally developed technology. 

'''[[Bayh-Dole Act]] of 1980''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/ip/health/bd/ |title=The Bayh-Dole Act |publisher=Cptech.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives federal contractors, grantees, and cooperative agreement funding recipients the option to retain ownership rights to inventions they create as part of a federally sponsored research project and profit from commercializing them. The act also protects the government’s interests by requiring that federal agencies and their authorized funding recipients retain a license to practice the invention for government purposes. It ultimately granted universities the clear right to pursue patents on government-funded research.

'''The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ |title=United States Department of Health and Human Services |publisher=Hhs.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides the legal basis for and encourages shared use of Government facilities and resources with the private sector to aid in the commercialization of new products and services. This act established the [[Cooperative Research and Development Agreement]] (CRADA) which encourages such research and development and it gave organizations the option to license their product.

== Inventions and patenting ==

The goal of the NIDDK research is to expand the basic scientific knowledge pertaining to health.  Scientists submit manuscripts pertaining to their advances and discoveries to a variety of professional publications.   This assures distribution of taxpayer-funded research results.  Occasionally the research yields a potential new therapeutic, preventative treatment, or diagnostic product.  NIDDK technologies may be patented if this it facilitates or attracts investment by partners for further research and commercial development.  A patent is particularly important if development requires approval of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).

== Licensing technologies ==

TAO encourages the development by industry for public use and benefit of inventions from technology resulting from NIDDK and collaborative research. One of TAO's important functions is to raise visibility  of the Institutes inventions by seeking out possible partnerships to further commercial development in order to benefit public health. 

[[Commercialization]] is one of the most effective methods of transferring technologies. TAO assesses technical and marketing development, manufacturing requirements and financial feasibility in order to maximize a product’s or invention’s potential. TAO evaluates perceived need for the product, size of potential market, expected sales, advantages over competing products, and the cost of promoting the product. 

[[Royalties]] are a form of income that is received by the inventor and the Institute as a result of a license granted to a collaborator to develop, manufacture or otherwise use or produce the invention for sale or distribution. The royalty rate, usually a percentage of sales of the invention, is negotiated as part of the license agreement between NIDDK and the licensee.

== Research and technologies ==

NIDDK conducts and supports research on many chronic and costly diseases affecting public health: [[diabetes]], [[obesity]], nutrition, [[digestion|digestive]] disorders, endocrine and metabolic disorders, hematologic diseases, and kidney and urologic diseases, as well as complications from [[HIV]] infection. NIDDK’s biomedical research efforts could be generally characterized as “internal medicine”-oriented as they relate to the medical specialties of endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology, infectious disease, and nephrology. NIDDK employs clinicians who conduct and manage clinical research studies on these various diseases. NIDDK employs medicinal chemists, who conduct research to synthesize and evaluate both macro-molecules and small molecules, including agonists and antagonists to [[G protein-coupled receptors]] (GPCRs) such as [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH), [[Adenosine]], and [[5-Hydroxytryptamine]] (5-HT) receptors. In addition, NIDDK employs biologists and process scientists who create a vast array of technologies ranging from [[cell lines]] to [[transgenic]] and [[knock-out mouse]] models. The biological modeling mathematicians generate new tools such as the Body Weight Simulator, an online tool for obesity researchers and weight management professionals to better understand how diet and exercise quantitatively contribute to weight loss and weight loss maintenance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6378">'''Narrative [[criticism]]''' focuses on the stories a speaker or a writer tells to understand how they help us make meaning out of our daily human experiences. [[Narrative]] theory is a means by which we can comprehend how we impose order on our experiences and actions by giving them a narrative form. According to Walter Fisher,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fisher | first = Walter | title = Human Communication as Narration: Toward a Philosophy of Reason, Value, and Action | place = Columbia | publisher = U of South Carolina P | year = 1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}} narratives are fundamental to communication and provide structure for human experience and influence people to share common explanations and understandings (58). Fisher defines narratives as “symbolic actions-words and/or deeds that have sequence and meaning for those who live, create, or interpret them.” Study of narrative criticism, therefore, includes form (fiction or non-fiction, prose or poetry), [[genre]] (myth, history, legend, etc.), structure (including plot, [[Theme (literature) | theme]], [[irony]], foreshadowing, etc.) characterization, and communicator’s perspective.

Characteristics of a narrative were defined as early as [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' under plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Aristotle | title = Poetics | chapter = VI–VII}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He called plot as the “first principle” or the “soul of a [[tragedy]].” According to him, plot is the arrangement of incidents that imitate the action with a beginning, middle, and end. Plot includes introduction of characters, rising action and introduction of complication, development of complication, [[climax (narrative)]], and final resolution. As described by White  (1981)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= White |first= H |work= On Narrative |title= The Value of Narrativity in the Representation of Culture |editor-first = WJT |editor-last= Mitchell |place= Chicago |publisher= U of Chicago Press |year= 1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}} and Martin  (1986),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Martin | first = W | title = Recent Theories of Narrative | place = Ithaca, NY | publisher = Cornell UP | year = 1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}} plot involves a structure of action.  However, not all narratives contain a plot. Fragmentation occurs as the traditional plot disappears, narratives become less linear, and the burden of meaning making gets shifted from the narrator to the reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Michael Calvin | last1 = McGee | first2 = John S | last2 = Nelson | first3 = Michael | last3 = Sizemore |  year = 1990 | title = Narrative Reason in Public Argument}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}}

Narratives can be found in a range of practices such as novels, short stories, plays, films, histories, documentaries, gossip, biographies, television and scholarly books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = James | last = Jasinski | title = Sourcebook on Rhetoric | place = California | publisher = Sage | year = 2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=February 2015}}  All of these artifacts make excellent objects for narrative criticism. When performing a narrative criticism, critics should focus on the features of the narrative that allow them to say something meaningful about the artifact. Sample questions from Sonja K Foss&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sonja K | last = Foss | title = Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice | place = Illinois | publisher = Waveland | year = 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|312-313}} offer a guide for analysis:
* Setting – How does the setting relate to the plot and characters? How is the particular setting created? Is the setting textually prominent – highly developed and detailed – or negligible?
* Characters ([[Persona]]) – Are some of the characters non-human or inanimate phenomena, described as thinking and speaking beings? In what actions do the characters engage? Are the characters round (possess a variety of traits, some of them conflicting or contradictory) or flat (one or a few dominant traits making the character predictable)?
* [[Narrator]] – Is the narrative presented directly to the audience, or is it mediated by a narrator? What makes the narrator intrusive or not? What kind of person is the narrator (examine his or her ethos)?
* Events – What are the major and minor events? How are the events presented? Are the events active (expressing action) or stative (expressing a state or condition)?
* Temporal relations – Do events occur in a brief period of time or over many years? What is the relationship between the natural order of the events as they occurred and the order of their presentation in the telling of a narrative? Is the story in past or present tense?
*[[Causal]] relations – What cause-and-effect relationships are established in the narrative? Are events caused largely by human action, accident, or forces of nature? In how much detail are the causes and effects described?
*[[Audience]] – Is the audience a participant in the events recounted? What can be inferred about the audience’s attitudes, knowledge, or situation from the narrative? What seems to be the narrator’s evaluation of the audience’s knowledge, personality, and abilities?
*[[Theme (literature)|Theme]] – What is the major theme (general idea illustrated by the narrative) of the narrative? How is the theme articulated? How obvious and clear is the theme?
*Limitations: Traditional narrative criticism focuses primarily on the narrative and does not take the socioeconomic and political background into consideration; however, it is not opposed to New-Historicism theory. In addition, it does not take the narrator's motivations into consideration as it focuses on the narrative to generate the analysis. Also, as the critic looks at the overall unity of the narrative, the theory is not conducive to deconstruction techniques (19-20).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gale A. Yee|Yee, Gale]].

The '''Ndu languages''' are the best known [[language family|family]] of the [[Sepik languages]] of northern [[Papua New Guinea]]. ''Ndu'' is the word for 'man' in the languages that make up this group. The languages were first identified as a related family by Kirschbaum in 1922.

[[Abelam language|Abelam]] is the most populous language, with about 45,000 speakers, though [[Iatmül language|Iatmül]] is better known to the outside world. There are eight to twelve Ndu languages.

*[[Nggala language|Ngala]]
*Ndu proper
*:[[Iatmul language|Iatmul]], [[Manambu language|Manambu]], [[Yelogu language|Yelogu]] (Yalaku), [[Abelam language|Abelam]] (Ambulas), [[Boiken language|Boiken]]–[[Koiwat language|Koiwat]], [[Gaikundi language|Gaikundi]], [[Sos Kundi language|Sos Kundi]] (Sawos Kundi)

Also distinguished are [[Keak language|Keak]] (close to Iatmul or Sos Kundi), [[Kwasengen language|Kwasengen]] (or Hanga Hundi, close to Ambulas), [[Burui language|Burui]] (close to Gai Kundi), and [[Sengo language|Sengo]].

Most Sepik and neighboring languages have systems of three [[vowel]]s, {{IPA|/ɨ ə a/}}, that are distinct only in [[vowel height|height]]. Phonetic {{IPA|[i e u o]}} are a result of palatal and labial [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] of {{IPA|/ɨ ə/}} to adjacent consonants. The Ndu languages may take this reduction a step further: In these languages, {{IPA|/ɨ/}} is used as an [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel to break up [[consonant cluster]]s in [[compound word]]s. Within words, {{IPA|/ɨ/}} only occurs between similar consonants, and seems to be explicable as epenthesis there as well, so that the only underlying vowels that need to be assumed are {{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;/ə/ and /a/&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}. That is, the Ndu  languages may be a rare case of a two-vowel system, the others being the [[Arrernte language|Arrernte]] and [[Northwest Caucasian languages]]. However, contrasting analyses of these same languages may posit a dozen vowel monophthongs.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Jendraschek (2008) [http://conferences.arts.usyd.edu.au/program.php?cf=19 "The vowel system of Iatmul: emerging phonemes and unexpected contrasts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920071406/http://conferences.arts.usyd.edu.au/program.php?cf=19 |date=2009-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Benjamin west Death wolfe noble savage.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A detail from [[Benjamin West]]'s heroic, [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[history painting]], ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1771), depicting an idealized [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fryd|first=Vivien Green|title=Rereading the Indian in Benjamin West's "Death of General Wolfe"|year=1995|work=American Art|volume=9|number=1|page=75|jstor=3109196}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''noble savage''' is a literary [[stock character]] who embodies the concept of the [[Indigenous peoples|indigene]], outsider, wild human, an "[[Other (philosophy)|other]]" who has not been "corrupted" by [[civilization]], and therefore symbolizes humanity's innate goodness.

In English, the phrase first appeared in the 17th century in [[John Dryden]]'s heroic play ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' (1672),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27Av0zEmlqkC&amp;pg=PA106 |first=Earl |last=Miner |contribution=The Wild Man Through the Looking Glass |editor1-first=Edward |editor1-last=Dudley |editor2-first=Maximillian E |editor2-last=Novak |title=The Wild Man Within: An Image in Western Thought from the Renaissance to Romanticism |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |year=1972 |page=106|isbn=9780822975991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein it was used in reference to newly created man. "Savage" at that time could mean "wild beast" as well as "wild man".&lt;ref&gt;OED s.v. "savage" B.3.a.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase later became identified with the idealized picture of "nature's gentleman", which was an aspect of 18th-century [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalism]]. The noble savage achieved prominence as an [[oxymoron]]ic rhetorical device after 1851, when used sarcastically as the title for a satirical essay by English novelist [[Charles Dickens]], who some believe may have wished to disassociate himself from what he viewed as the "feminine" [[sentimentality]] of 18th and early 19th-century romantic [[primitivism]].{{efn|Grace Moore speculates that Dickens, although himself an abolitionist, was motivated by a wish to differentiate himself from what he believed was the feminine sentimentality and bad writing of female philanthropists and writers such as [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], with whom he, as a reformist writer, was often associated.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Moore, "Reappraising Dickens's 'Noble Savage'", ''The Dickensian'' 98:458 (2002): 236–243.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The idea that humans are essentially good is often attributed to the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]],{{Citation needed|reason=debate about the goodness of man goes back much earlier, in Christian philosophy, original sin is the concept of people being born with inherent sinfulness|date=February 2018}} a [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] supporter of [[constitutional monarchy]]. In his ''Inquiry Concerning Virtue'' (1699), Shaftesbury had postulated that the [[Moral sense theory|moral sense]] in humans is natural and innate and based on feelings, rather than resulting from the indoctrination of a particular [[religion]]. Shaftesbury was reacting to [[Thomas Hobbes]]'s justification of an absolutist [[Centralized government|central state]] in his ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', "Chapter XIII", in which Hobbes famously holds that the [[state of nature]] is a "war of all against all" in which men's lives are "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short". Hobbes further calls the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] an example of a contemporary people living in such a state. Although writers since antiquity had described people living in pre-civilized conditions, Hobbes is credited with inventing the term "State of Nature". [[Ross Harrison (academic)|Ross Harrison]] writes that "Hobbes seems to have invented this useful term."&lt;ref&gt;''Locke, Hobbs, and Confusion's Masterpiece'', Ross Harrison, (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to what is sometimes believed, [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] never used the phrase ''noble savage'' (French ''[[:fr:bon sauvage|bon sauvage]]''). However, the character of the ''noble savage'' appeared in French literature at least as early as [[Jacques Cartier]] (coloniser of [[Québec]], speaking of the [[Iroquois]]) and [[Michel de Montaigne]] (philosopher, speaking of the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinamba]]) in the 16th century.

==Pre-history of the noble savage==
[[File:Southerne Oroonoko 1776 performance.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Illustration of a 1776 performance of Oroonoko.|right|200px|Oroonoko kills Imoinda in a 1776 performance of [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''[[Oroonoko]].'']]

[[Tacitus]]' [[Germania (book)|''De origine et situ Germanorum'']] (''Germania''), written {{circa}} 98 AD, has been described as a predecessor of the modern noble savage concept, which started in the 17th and 18th centuries in [[Western literature|western European]] [[travel literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Paradies auf Erden?: Mythenbildung als Form von Fremdwahrnehmung : der Südsee-Mythos in Schlüsselphasen der deutschen Literatur Anja Hall Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 16th and 17th centuries, the figure of the indigene or "savage"—and later, increasingly, the "good savage"—was held up as a reproach to European civilization, then in the throes of the [[French Wars of Religion]] and [[Thirty Years' War]]. During the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] (1572), some ten to twenty thousand men, women, and children were massacred by [[Catholicism|Catholic]] mobs, chiefly in [[Paris]], but also throughout France. This horrifying breakdown of civil control was deeply disturbing to thoughtful people on both sides of the religious divide.

{{quotation|Foremost among the atrocities connected with the religious conflict was the St. Batholomew's massacre (August 224, 1572) ... The Parisian populace [was] inflamed by anti-Protestant preaching, and a general massacre ensued, devastating the Huguenot community of Paris. Bodies were stripped naked, mutilated, and thrown into the Seine. The massacres spread throughout France into the fall of 1572, spreading as far as Bordeaux [home of Montaigne]. ... Estimates of the total number of deaths vary widely; modern historians tend to accept the approximate number of ten thousand. ... Huguenots were not entirely innocent of massacres themselves|Ullrich Langer, "Montaigne's political and religious context", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Montaigne''&lt;ref&gt;"Montaigne's political and religious context" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Montaigne'' (Cambridge, 2005), p. 14 (cf. also Tom Conley, "The ''Essays'' and the New World" p. 80 in the same volume.)&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In his famous essay "Of Cannibals" (1580),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_2/montaigne.html Essay "Of Cannibals"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel de Montaigne]]—himself a Catholic—reported that the [[Tupinambá people]] of Brazil ceremoniously eat the bodies of their dead enemies as a matter of honour. However, he reminded his readers that Europeans behave even more barbarously when they burn each other alive for disagreeing about religion (he implies): "One calls 'barbarism' whatever he is not accustomed to."

{{quotation|The cannibal practices are admitted [by Montaigne] but presented as part of a complex and balanced set of customs and beliefs which "make sense" in their own right. They are attached to a powerfully positive morality of valor and pride, one that would have been likely to appeal to early modern codes of honor, and they are contrasted with modes of behavior in the France of the wars of religion which appear as distinctly less attractive, such as torture and barbarous methods of execution (...)&lt;ref&gt;Terence Cave, ''How to Read Montaigne'' (London: Granta Books, 2007), pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In "Of Cannibals", Montaigne uses [[cultural relativism|cultural]] (but not [[moral relativism|moral]]) [[relativism]] for the purpose of satire. His cannibals are neither noble nor especially good, but not worse than 16th-century Europeans. In this [[Classical liberalism|classical]] [[Humanism|humanist]] view, [[Convention (norm)|customs]] differ but people everywhere are prone to cruelty, a quality that Montaigne detested.

{{quotation|In his ''Essais'' ... Montaigne discussed the first three wars of religion (1562–63; 1567–68; 1568–70) quite specifically; he had personally participated in them, on the side of the royal army, in southwestern France. The St. Bartholomew's Day massacre led him to retire to his lands in the Périgord region, and remain silent on all public affairs until the 1580s. Thus, it seems that he was traumatized by the massacre. To him, cruelty was a criterion that differentiated the Wars of Religion from previous conflicts, which he idealized. Montaigne considered that three factors accounted for the shift from regular war to the carnage of civil war: popular intervention, religious demagogy and the never-ending aspect of the conflict..... He chose to depict cruelty through the image of hunting, which fitted with the tradition of condemning hunting for its association with blood and death, but it was still quite surprising, to the extent that this practice was part of the aristocratic way of life. Montaigne reviled hunting by describing it as an urban massacre scene. In addition, the man-animal relationship allowed him to define virtue, which he presented as the opposite of cruelty. … [as] a sort of natural benevolence based on ... personal feelings. … Montaigne associated the propensity to cruelty toward animals, with that exercised toward men. After all, following the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, the invented image of Charles IX shooting Huguenots from the Louvre palace window did combine the established reputation of the king as a hunter, with a stigmatization of hunting, a cruel and perverted custom, did it not?|David El Kenz|Massacres During the Wars of Religion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massviolence.org/Massacres-during-the-Wars-of-Religion?cs=print David El Kenz,"Massacres During the Wars of Religion", 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The treatment of indigenous peoples by the Spanish [[Conquistador]]s also produced a great deal of bad conscience and recriminations.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pagden, ''The Fall of the Natural Man: the American Indian and the origins of comparative ethnology. Cambridge Iberian and Latin American Studies.''(Cambridge University Press, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish priest [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], who witnessed it, may have been the first to idealize the simple life of the indigenous Americans. He and other observers praised their simple manners and reported that they were incapable of lying.

European angst over [[colonialism]] inspired fictional treatments such as [[Aphra Behn]]'s novel ''[[Oroonoko]], or the Royal Slave'' (1688), about a [[Slave rebellion|slave revolt]] in [[Suriname|Surinam]] in the [[West Indies]]. Behn's story was not primarily a protest against [[slavery]]; rather, it was written for money, and it met readers' expectations by following the conventions of the European [[romance novel]]la. The leader of the revolt, Oroonoko, is truly noble in that he is a hereditary African prince, and he laments his lost African homeland in the traditional terms of a classical [[Golden Age]]. He is not a savage but dresses and behaves like a European [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]. Behn's story was adapted for the stage by Irish playwright [[Thomas Southerne]], who stressed its sentimental aspects, and as time went on, it came to be seen as addressing the issues of slavery and colonialism, remaining very popular throughout the 18th century.

==Origin of term==
In English, the phrase ''Noble Savage'' first appeared in poet [[John Dryden]]'s heroic play, ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' (1672):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
I am as free as nature first made man,
Ere the base laws of servitude began,
When wild in woods the noble savage ran.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The hero who speaks these words in Dryden's play is here denying the right of a prince to put him to death, on the grounds that he is not that prince's subject. These lines were quoted by Scott as the heading to Chapter 22 of his "A Legend of Montrose" (1819). "Savage" is better taken here in the sense of "wild beast", so that the phrase "noble savage" is to be read as a witty conceit meaning simply the beast that is above the other beasts, or man.

[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologist]] Ter Ellingson believes that Dryden had picked up the expression "noble savage" from a 1609 travelogue about Canada by the French explorer [[Marc Lescarbot]], in which there was a chapter with the ironic heading: "The Savages are Truly Noble", meaning simply  that they enjoyed the right to hunt game, a privilege in France granted only to hereditary aristocrats. It is not known if Lescarbot was aware of Montaigne's stigmatization of the aristocratic pastime of hunting, though some authors believe he was familiar with Montaigne. Lescarbot's familiarity with Montaigne, is discussed by Ter Ellingson in ''The Myth of the Noble Savage''.&lt;ref&gt;The Myth of the Noble Savage, Ter Ellingson, (University of California, 2001), note p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dryden's day the word "savage" did not necessarily have the connotations of cruelty now associated with it. Instead, as an adjective, it could as easily mean "wild", as in a wild flower, for example. Thus he wrote in 1697, 'the savage cherry grows. ...';.&lt;ref&gt;(OED 'Savage', A, I, 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholar, Audrey Smedley, believes that: "English conceptions of 'the savage' were grounded in expansionist conflicts with Irish pastoralists and more broadly, in isolation from, and denigration of neighboring European peoples." and Ellingson agrees that "The ethnographic literature lends considerable support for such arguments"&lt;ref&gt;(Ellingson [2001], p. 389).&lt;/ref&gt;

In France the [[Stock character|stock figure]] that in English is called the "noble savage" has always been simply "le bon sauvage", "the good wild man", a term without any of the paradoxical frisson of the English one. [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] is generally credited for being at the origin of this myth in his [[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]] (1580), especially "Of Coaches" and "Of Cannibals". This character, an idealized portrayal of "Nature's Gentleman", was an aspect of 18th-century [[sentimentalism (literature)|sentimentalism]], along with other stock characters such as, the Virtuous Milkmaid, the Servant-More-Clever-than-the-Master (such as [[Sancho Panza]] and [[Figaro (character in operas and plays)|Figaro]], among countless others), and the general theme of virtue in the lowly born. The use of stock characters (especially in theater) to express moral truths derives from classical antiquity and goes back to [[Theophrastus]]'s ''Characters'', a work that enjoyed a great vogue in the 17th and 18th centuries and was translated by [[Jean de La Bruyère]]. The practice largely died out with advent of 19th-century [[Literary realism|realism]] but lasted much longer in genre literature, such as adventure stories, Westerns, and, arguably, science fiction. Nature's Gentleman, whether European-born or exotic, takes his place in this cast of characters, along with the Wise Egyptian, Persian, and Chinaman. "But now, alongside the Good Savage, the Wise Egyptian claims his place." Some of these types are discussed by Paul Hazard in ''The European Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;''The European Mind'', Paul Hazard (1680–1715) (Cleveland, Ohio: Meridian Books [1937], 1969), pp. 14–24 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;

He had always existed, from the time of the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', where he appears as [[Enkiddu]], the wild-but-good man who lives with animals. Another instance is the untutored-but-noble medieval knight, [[Parsifal]]. The [[Bible|Biblical]] shepherd boy [[David]] falls into this category. The association of virtue with withdrawal from society—and specifically from cities—was a familiar theme in religious literature.

''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' an Islamic philosophical tale (or thought experiment) by [[Ibn Tufail]] from 12th-century [[Al-Andalus|Andalusia]], straddles the divide between the religious and the secular. The tale is of interest because it was known to the [[New England Puritan culture and recreation|New England Puritan]] divine, [[Cotton Mather]]. Translated into English (from Latin) in 1686 and 1708, it tells the story of Hayy, a [[Feral child|wild child]], raised by a gazelle, without human contact, on a deserted island in the Indian Ocean. Purely through the use of his reason, Hayy goes through all the gradations of knowledge before emerging into human society, where he revealed to be a believer of [[Natural Theology|natural religion]], which Cotton Mather, as a Christian Divine, identified with [[Primitive Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Doyle R. Quiggle, “Ibn Tufayl's Hayy Ibn Yaqdan in New England: A Spanish-Islamic Tale in Cotton Mather's ''Christian Philosopher''?” ''Arizona Quarterly: A Journal of American Literature, Culture, and Theory'', 64: 2 (Summer 2008): 1–32.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of Hayy is both a Natural man and a Wise Persian, but not a Noble Savage.

The ''locus classicus'' of the 18th-century portrayal of the American Indian are the famous lines from [[Alexander Pope]]'s "[[Essay on Man]]" (1734):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind
Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;
His soul proud Science never taught to stray
Far as the solar walk or milky way;
Yet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n,
Behind the cloud-topp'd hill, a humbler heav'n;
Some safer world in depth of woods embrac'd,
Some happier island in the wat'ry waste,
Where slaves once more their native land behold,
No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold!
To be, contents his natural desire;
He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire:
But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,
His faithful dog shall bear him company.''&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Pope, writing in 1734, the Indian was a purely abstract figure— "poor" either meant ironically, or applied because he was uneducated and a heathen, but also happy because he was living close to Nature. This view reflects the typical [[Age of Reason]] belief that men are everywhere and in all times the same as well as a Deistic conception of natural religion (although Pope, like Dryden, was Catholic). Pope's phrase, "Lo the Poor Indian", became almost as famous as Dryden's "noble savage" and, in the 19th century, when more people began to have first hand knowledge of and conflict with the Indians, would be used derisively for similar sarcastic effect.{{efn|In 1859, journalist Horace Greeley, famous for his advice to "Go west, young man", used "Lo, The Poor Indian" as the title for a letter written from Colorado:
{{quotation|I have learned to appreciate better than hitherto, and to make more allowance for, the dislike, aversion, contempt wherewith Indians are usually regarded by their white neighbors, and have been since the days of the Puritans. It needs but little familiarity with the actual, palpable aborigines to convince anyone that the poetic Indian—the Indian of Cooper and Longfellow—is only visible to the poet's eye. To the prosaic observer, the average Indian of the woods and prairies is a being who does little credit to human nature—a slave of appetite and sloth, never emancipated from the tyranny of one animal passion save by the more ravenous demands of another. As I passed over those magnificent bottoms of the Kansas, which form the reservations of the Delawares, Potawatamies, etc., constituting the very best corn-lands on earth, and saw their owners sitting around the doors of their lodges at the height of the planting season and in as good, bright planting weather as sun and soil ever made, I could not help saying, "These people must die out—there is no help for them. God has given this earth to those who will subdue and cultivate it, and it is vain to struggle against His righteous decree."|"Lo!

The term was also “a sarcastic reference to those eastern humanitarians whose idea of the Indian was so at variance with the frontiersman's bloodthirsty savage. "The ''Leavenworth, Kansas, Times and Conservative'', for example, commented indignantly on the story of Thomas Alderdice, whose wife was captured and killed by Cheyennes: 'We wish some philanthropists who talk about civilizing the Indians, could have heard this unfortunate and almost broken-hearted man tell his story. We think they would at least have wavered a little in their opinion of the Lo family'"&lt;ref&gt;Louise Barnett, in ''Touched by Fire: the Life, Death, and Mythic Afterlife of George Armstrong Custer'' (University of Nebraska Press [1986], 2006), pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Attributes of romantic primitivism==
{{quotation|On our arrival upon this coast we found there a savage race who ... lived by hunting and by the fruits which the trees spontaneously produced. These people ... were greatly surprised and alarmed by the sight of our ships and arms and retired to the mountains. But since our soldiers were curious to see the country and hunt deer, they were met by some of these savage fugitives. The leaders of the savages accosted them thus: "We abandoned for you, the pleasant sea-coast, so that we have nothing left but these almost inaccessible mountains: at least it is just that you leave us in peace and liberty. Go, and never forget that you owe your lives to our feeling of humanity. Never forget that it was from a people whom you call rude and savage that you receive this lesson in gentleness and generosity. ... We abhor that brutality which, under the gaudy names of ambition and glory, ... sheds the blood of men who are all brothers.  ...  We value health, frugality, liberty, and vigor of body and mind: the love of virtue, the fear of the gods, a natural goodness toward our neighbors, attachment to our friends, fidelity to all the world, moderation in prosperity, fortitude in adversity, courage always bold to speak the truth, and abhorrence of flattery. ...  If the offended gods so far blind you as to make you reject peace, you will find, when it is too late, that the people who are moderate and lovers of peace are the most formidable in war.|[[Fénelon]]|[[Les Aventures de Télémaque|The Adventures of Telemachus]] (1699)&lt;ref&gt;François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon, Encounter with the Mandurians, in Chapter IX of ''Telemachus, son of Ulysses'', translated by Patrick Riley (Cambridge University Press, [1699] 1994), pp. 130–131. This didactic novel (arguably the first "boys' book") by the Archbishop of Cambrai, tutor to the seven-year-old grandson of Louis XIV, was perhaps the most internationally popular book of the 18th and early 19th centuries, a favorite of [[Montesquieu]], [[Rousseau]], [[Herder]], [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], and countless others. Patrick Riley's translation is based on that of Tobias Smollett, 1776 (op cit p. xvii).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1st century AD, sterling qualities such as those enumerated above by Fénelon (excepting perhaps belief in the brotherhood of man) had been attributed by [[Tacitus]] in his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' to the German barbarians, in pointed contrast to the softened, Romanized [[Gauls]]. By inference Tacitus was criticizing his own Roman culture for getting away from its roots—which was the perennial function of such comparisons. Tacitus's Germans did not inhabit a "[[Golden Age]]" of ease but were tough and inured to hardship, qualities which he saw as preferable to the decadent softness of civilized life. In antiquity this form of "hard primitivism", whether admired or deplored (both attitudes were common), co-existed in rhetorical opposition to the "soft primitivism" of visions of a lost [[Golden Age]] of ease and plenty.&lt;ref&gt;For the distinction between "hard" and "soft" primitivism see [[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy|A. O, Lovejoy]] and G. Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'', Baltimore, I, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;

As art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] explains:{{quotation|There had been, from the beginning of classical speculation, two contrasting opinions about the natural state of man, each of them, of course, a "Gegen-Konstruktion" to the conditions under which it was formed. One view, termed "soft" primitivism in an illuminating book by Lovejoy and Boas,  conceives of primitive life as a golden age of plenty, innocence, and happiness—in other words, as civilized life purged of its vices. The other, "hard" form of primitivism conceives of primitive life as an almost subhuman existence full of terrible hardships and devoid of all comforts—in other words, as civilized life stripped of its virtues.|[[Erwin Panofsky]], art historian&lt;ref&gt;Erwin Panofsky, "Et in Arcadia Ego", in ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (New York: Doubleday, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 18th century the debates about primitivism centered around the examples of the people of Scotland as often as the American Indians. The rude ways of the Highlanders were often scorned, but their toughness also called forth a degree of admiration among "hard" primitivists, just as that of the [[Sparta]]ns and the Germans had done in antiquity. One Scottish writer described his Highland countrymen this way:{{quotation|They greatly excel the Lowlanders in all the exercises that require agility; they are incredibly abstemious, and patient of hunger and fatigue; so steeled against the weather, that in traveling, even when the ground is covered with snow, they never look for a house, or any other shelter but their plaid, in which they wrap themselves up, and go to sleep under the cope of heaven. Such people, in quality of soldiers, must be invincible ...|[[Tobias Smollett]]|[[The Expedition of Humphry Clinker]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Tobias Smollett]], ''[[The Expedition of Humphry Clinker]]'' ([1771] London: Penguin Books, 1967), p. 292. One of the characters in Smollett's ''Humphry Clinker'', Lieutenant Lismahago, is a kind of ludicrous noble savage. A proud and irascible Scotsman of good family and advancing years, Lismahago has been so poorly requited by the government for his services in the Canadian wars that he is planning to return to Canada to live out his days with his Native American common-law wife, in squalor but with more honor and decency than would be possible as a pauper at home.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reaction to Hobbes==
Debates about "soft" and "hard" primitivism intensified with the publication in 1651 of [[Hobbes]]'s ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' (or ''Commonwealth''), a justification of absolute monarchy. Hobbes, a "hard Primitivist", flatly asserted that life in a [[state of nature]] was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"—a "war of all against all":

{{quotation|Whatsoever therefore is consequent to a time of Warre, where every man is Enemy to every man; the same is consequent to the time, wherein men live without other security, than what their own strength, and their own invention shall furnish them withall. In such condition, there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continuall feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short|Hobbes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3207 ''Leviathan'']&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Reacting to the wars of religion of his own time and the previous century, he maintained that the absolute rule of a king was the only possible alternative to the otherwise inevitable violence and disorder of civil war. Hobbes' hard primitivism may have been as venerable as the tradition of soft primitivism, but his use of it was new. He used it to argue that the state was founded on a [[social contract]] in which men voluntarily gave up their liberty in return for the peace and security provided by total surrender to an absolute ruler, whose legitimacy stemmed from the Social Contract and not from God.

Hobbes' vision of the natural depravity of man inspired fervent disagreement among those who opposed absolute government. His most influential and effective opponent in the last decade of the 17th century was [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]]. Shaftesbury countered that, contrary to Hobbes, humans in a state of nature were neither good nor bad, but that they possessed a moral sense based on the emotion of sympathy, and that this emotion was the source and foundation of human goodness and [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]]. Like his contemporaries (all of whom who were educated by reading classical authors such as [[Livy]], [[Cicero]], and [[Horace]]), Shaftesbury admired the simplicity of life of classical antiquity. He urged a would-be author “to search for that simplicity of manners, and innocence of behavior, which has been often known among mere savages; ere they were corrupted by our commerce” (''Advice to an Author'', Part III.iii). Shaftesbury's denial of the innate depravity of man was taken up by contemporaries such as the popular Irish essayist [[Richard Steele]] (1672–1729), who attributed the corruption of contemporary manners to false education. Influenced by Shaftesbury and his followers, 18th-century readers, particularly in England, were swept up by the cult of [[Sensibility]] that grew up around Shaftesbury's  concepts of [[sympathy]] and benevolence.

Meanwhile, in France, where those who criticized government or Church authority could be imprisoned without trial or hope of appeal, primitivism was used primarily as a way to protest the repressive rule of Louis XIV and XV, while avoiding censorship. Thus, in the beginning of the 18th century, a French travel writer, the [[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Baron de Lahontan]], who had actually lived among the [[Wyandot people|Huron Indians]], put potentially dangerously radical [[Deist]] and egalitarian arguments in the mouth of a Canadian Indian, Adario, who was perhaps the most striking and significant figure of the "good" (or "noble") savage, as we understand it now, to make his appearance on the historical stage:

{{quotation|Adario sings the praises of Natural Religion. ... As against society he puts forward a sort of primitive Communism, of which the certain fruits are Justice and a happy life. ... He looks with compassion on poor civilized man—no courage, no strength, incapable of providing himself with food and shelter: a degenerate, a moral ''cretin'', a figure of fun in his blue coat, his red hose, his black hat, his white plume and his green ribands. He never really lives because he is always torturing the life out of himself to clutch at wealth and honors which, even if he wins them, will prove to be but glittering illusions. ... For science and the arts are but the parents of corruption. The Savage obeys the will of Nature, his kindly mother, therefore he is happy. It is civilized folk who are the real barbarians.|Paul Hazard|The European Mind&lt;ref&gt;See Paul Hazard, ''The European Mind (1680–1715)'' ([1937], 1969), pp. 13–14, and passim.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Published in Holland, Lahontan's writings, with their controversial attacks on established religion and social customs, were immensely popular. Over twenty editions were issued between 1703 and 1741, including editions in French, English, Dutch and German.

{{quotation|Interest in the remote peoples of the earth, in the unfamiliar civilizations of the East, in the untutored races of America and Africa, was vivid in France in the 18th century. Everyone knows how Voltaire and Montesquieu used Hurons or Persians to hold up the glass to Western manners and morals, as Tacitus used the Germans to criticize the society of Rome. But very few ever look into the seven volumes of the Abbé Raynal’s ''History of the Two Indies'', which appeared in 1772. It is however one of the most remarkable books of the century. Its immediate practical importance lay in the array of facts which it furnished to the friends of humanity in the movement against negro slavery. But it was also an effective attack on the Church and the sacerdotal system. ... Raynal brought home to the conscience of Europeans the miseries which had befallen the natives of the New World through the Christian conquerors and their priests. He was not indeed an enthusiastic preacher of Progress. He was unable to decide between the comparative advantages of the savage state of nature and the most highly cultivated society. But he observes that “the human race is what we wish to make it", that the felicity of man depends entirely on the improvement of legislation, and ... his view is generally optimistic.|J.B.

Many of the most incendiary passages in Raynal's book, one of the bestsellers of the eighteenth century, especially in the Western Hemisphere, are now known to have been in fact written by [[Diderot]]. Reviewing Jonathan Israel's ''Democratic Enlightenment: Philosophy, Revolution, and Human Rights'', Jeremy Jennings, notes that ''The History of the Two Indies'', in the opinion of Jonathan Israel, was the text that "made a world revolution" by delivering "the most devastating single blow to the existing order":

{{quotation|Usually (and incorrectly) attributed to the pen of the Abbé Raynal, its ostensible theme of Europe's colonial expansion allowed Diderot not only to depict the atrocities and greed of colonialism but also to develop an argument in defense of universal human rights, equality, and a life free from tyranny and fanaticism.

In the later 18th century, the published voyages of Captain [[James Cook]] and [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] seemed to open a glimpse into an unspoiled [[Garden of Eden|Edenic culture]] that still existed in the [[Christianization|un-Christianized]] [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]]. Their popularity inspired [[Diderot]]'s ''[[Supplément au voyage de Bougainville|Supplement to the Voyage of Bougainville]]'' (1772), a scathing critique of European sexual hypocrisy and colonial exploitation.

[[Benjamin Franklin]], who had negotiated with the Indians during the French and Indian War, protested vehemently against the Paxton massacre that took place at Conestoga, in western Pennsylvania, of December 1763, in which white vigilantes massacred Indian women and children, many of whom had converted to Christianity. Franklin himself personally organized a Quaker militia to control the white population and "strengthen the government". In his pamphlet ''[[Bagatelles and satires (Benjamin Franklin)#Remarks Concerning the Savages of North America|Remarks Concerning the Savages of North America]]'' (1784), Franklin deplored the use of the term "savages" for Native Americans:

{{quote|Savages we call them, because their manners differ from ours, which we think the perfection of civility; they think the same of theirs.|author=[[Benjamin Franklin]]&lt;ref name="ForgottenFoundersCh5"/&gt;}}

Franklin used the massacres to illustrate his point that no race had a monopoly on virtue, likening the Paxton vigilantes to  "Christian White Savages'". Franklin cried out to a just God to punish those who carried the Bible in one hand and the hatchet in the other: 'O ye unhappy Perpetrators of this Horrid Wickedness!'"&lt;ref name="ForgottenFoundersCh5"/&gt; Franklin praised the Indian way of life, their customs of hospitality, their councils, which reached agreement by discussion and consensus, and noted that many white men had voluntarily given up the purported advantages of civilization to live among them, but that the opposite was rare.

{{quotation|Franklin's writings on American Indians were remarkably free of ethnocentricism, although he often used words such as "savages," which carry more prejudicial connotations in the twentieth century than in his time. Franklin's cultural relativism was perhaps one of the purest expressions of Enlightenment assumptions that stressed racial equality and the universality of moral sense among peoples. Systematic racism was not called into service until a rapidly expanding frontier demanded that enemies be dehumanized during the rapid, historically inevitable westward movement of the nineteenth century. Franklin's respect for cultural diversity did not reappear widely as an assumption in Euro-American thought until Franz Boas and others revived it around the end of the nineteenth century. Franklin's writings on Indians express the fascination of the Enlightenment with nature, the natural origins of man and society, and natural (or human) rights. They are likewise imbued with a search (which amounted at times almost to a ransacking of the past) for alternatives to monarchy as a form of government, and to orthodox state-recognized churches as a form of worship.|[[Bruce E. Johansen]]|Forgotten Founders: Benjamin Franklin, the Iroquois, and the Rationale for the American Revolution&lt;ref name="ForgottenFoundersCh5"/&gt;
}}

Though retrospectively it may seem to us that Franklin may have idealized the Indians to make a rhetorical point, the phrase "noble savage" never appears in his writings.

==Erroneous identification of Rousseau with the noble savage==
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], like Shaftesbury, also insisted that man was born with the potential for goodness; and he, too, argued that civilization, with its envy and self-consciousness, has made men bad. In his ''Discourse on the Origins of Inequality Among Men'' (1754), Rousseau maintained that man in a State of Nature had been a solitary, ape-like creature, who was not ''méchant'' (bad), as Hobbes had maintained, but (like some other animals) had an "innate repugnance to see others of his kind suffer" (and this natural sympathy constituted the Natural Man's one-and-only natural virtue).&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy (1923, 1948) p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Rousseau's fellow ''[[philosophe]]'', Voltaire, objecting to Rousseau's egalitarianism, who charged him with primitivism and accused him of wanting to make people go back and walk on all fours.{{efn|Voltaire was no believer in human equality: "It is notorious that Voltaire objected to the education of laborers' children"&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Gay]], ''The Enlightenment: The Science of Freedom'' (New York: W.W. Norton, [1969] 1977), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Because Rousseau was the preferred philosopher of the radical [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] of the [[French Revolution]], he, above all, became tarred with the accusation of promoting the notion of the "noble savage", especially during the polemics about [[Imperialism]] and [[scientific racism]] in the last half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;See Ter Ellingson (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the phrase "noble savage" does not occur in any of Rousseau's writings.{{efn|In a review of a book discussing [[Steven Pinker]], Peter Gay writes "As far as the noble savage is concerned, that phrase is from Dryden and does not appear in Rousseau's writings. In the years I taught the history of political theory at Columbia to a sizable class of undergraduates, I would offer students a hundred dollars if they could find "Noble Savage" anywhere in Rousseau.

According to the historian of ideas, Arthur O. Lovejoy:

}}

In his ''Discourse on the Origins of Inequality'', Rousseau, anticipating the language of Darwin, states that as the animal-like human species increased there arose a "formidable struggle for existence" between it and other species for food.&lt;ref&gt;(Lovejoy (1960), p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt; It was then, under the pressure of necessity, that ''le caractère spécifique de l'espèce humaine''—the specific quality that distinguished man from the beasts—emerged—intelligence, a power, meager at first but yet capable of an "almost unlimited development". Rousseau calls this power the ''faculté de se perfectionner''—perfectibility.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy attributes the invention of the term to [[Michel-Étienne Turgot|Turgot]] in 1750, but, according to him, it was Rousseau who gave it wide currency. See Lovejoy (1960), p. 24,&lt;/ref&gt; Man invented tools, discovered fire, and in short, began to emerge from the state of nature. Yet at this stage, men also began to compare himself to others: "It is easy to see. ... that all our labors are directed upon two objects only, namely, for oneself, the commodities of life, and consideration on the part of others." ''Amour propre''—the desire for consideration (self regard), Rousseau calls a "factitious feeling arising, only in society, which leads a man to think more highly of himself than of any other." This passion began to show itself with the first moment of human self-consciousness, which was also that of the first step of human progress: "It is this desire for reputation, honors, and preferment which devours us all ... this rage to be distinguished, that we own what is best and worst in men—our virtues and our vices, our sciences and our errors, our conquerors and our philosophers—in short, a vast number of evil things and a small number of good." It is this "which inspires men to all the evils which they inflict upon one another.".&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, ''Discourse on the Origins of Inequality'', as quoted in Lovejoy (1960), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; To be sure, Rousseau praises the newly discovered "savage" tribes (whom Rousseau does ''not'' consider in a "state of nature"), as living a life that is simpler and more egalitarian than that of the Europeans;  and he sometimes praises this "third stage" it in terms that could be confused with the romantic primitivism fashionable in his times. He also identifies ancient primitive communism under a patriarchy, such as he believes characterized the "youth" of mankind, as perhaps the happiest state and perhaps also illustrative of  how man was intended by God to live. But these stages are not all good, but rather are mixtures of good and bad. According to Lovejoy, Rousseau's basic view of human nature after the emergence of social living is basically identical to that of Hobbes.&lt;ref&gt;"Rousseau's theory of human nature here, in short, is identical with that of Hobbes", Lovejoy (1960), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Rousseau does not believe that it is possible or desirable to go back to a primitive state. It is only by acting together in civil society and binding themselves to its laws that men become men; and only a properly constituted society and reformed system of education could make men good.  According to Lovejoy:

{{quotation|For Rousseau, man's good lay in departing from his "natural" state—but not too much; "perfectability" up to a certain point was desirable, though beyond that point an evil. Not its infancy but its ''jeunesse'' [youth] was the best age of the human race. The distinction may seem to us slight enough; but in the mid-eighteenth century it amounted to an abandonment of the stronghold of the primitivistic position. Nor was this the whole of the difference. As compared with the then-conventional pictures of the savage state, Rousseau's account even of this third stage is far less idyllic; and it is so because of his fundamentally unfavorable view of human nature ''quâ'' human. ... His savages are quite unlike Dryden's Indians: "Guiltless men, that danced away their time, / Fresh as the groves and happy as their clime—" or Mrs. Aphra Behn's natives of Surinam, who represented an absolute idea of the first state of innocence, "before men knew how to sin." The men in Rousseau's "nascent society" already had 'bien des querelles et des combats [many quarrels and fights]'; ''l'amour propre'' was already manifest in them ... and slights or affronts were consequently visited with ''vengeances terribles.''&lt;ref&gt;See Lovejoy (1960), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

For Rousseau the remedy was not in going back to the primitive but in reorganizing society on the basis of a properly drawn up social compact, so as to "draw from the very evil from which we suffer [i.e., civilization and progress] the remedy which shall cure it." Lovejoy concludes that Rousseau's doctrine, as expressed in his ''Discourse on Inequality'':

{{quotation|declares that there is a dual process going on through history; on the one hand, an indefinite progress in all those powers and achievements which express merely the potency of man's intellect; on the other hand, an increasing estrangement of men from one another, an intensification of ill-will and mutual fear, culminating in a monstrous epoch of universal conflict and mutual destruction [i.e., the ''fourth'' stage in which we now find ourselves]. And the chief cause of the latter process Rousseau, following Hobbes and Mandeville, found, as we have seen, in that unique passion of the self-conscious animal – pride, self esteem, ''le besoin de se mettre au dessus des autres'' ["the need to put oneself above others"]. A large survey of history does not belie these generalizations, and the history of the period since Rousseau wrote lends them a melancholy verisimilitude. Precisely the two processes, which he described have ... been going on upon a scale beyond all precedent: immense progress in man's knowledge and in his powers over nature, and at the same time a steady increase of rivalries, distrust, hatred and at last "the most horrible state of war" ... [Moreover Rousseau] failed to realize fully how strongly ''amour propre'' tended to assume a collective form ... in pride of race, of nationality, of class.&lt;ref&gt;Lovejoy (1960), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

==19th century belief in progress and the fall of the natural man==
During the 19th century the idea that men were everywhere and always the same that had characterized both classical antiquity and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] was exchanged for a more organic and dynamic evolutionary concept of human history. Advances in technology now made the indigenous man and his simpler way of life appear, not only inferior, but also, even his defenders agreed, foredoomed by the inexorable advance of [[social progress|progress]] to inevitable extinction. The sentimentalized "primitive" ceased to figure as a moral reproach to the decadence of the effete European, as in previous centuries. Instead, the argument shifted to a discussion of whether his demise should be considered a desirable or regrettable eventuality. As the century progressed, native peoples and their traditions increasingly became a foil serving to highlight the accomplishments of Europe and the expansion of the European Imperial powers, who justified their policies on the basis of a presumed racial and cultural superiority.&lt;ref&gt;See reference to Frederick E. Hoxie's review of Ter Ellingson's ''Myth of the Noble Savage'' in note 32 below.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charles Dickens 1853 article on "The Noble Savage" in ''Household Words''==
In 1853 [[Charles Dickens]] wrote a scathingly sarcastic review in his weekly magazine ''[[Household Words]]'' of painter [[George Catlin]]'s show of American Indians when it visited England. In his essay, entitled [http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/2529/ "The Noble Savage"], Dickens expressed repugnance for Indians and their way of life in no uncertain terms, recommending that they ought to be “civilised off the face of the earth”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/2529/ "The Noble Savage"&lt;/ref&gt; (Dickens's essay refers back to Dryden's well-known use of the term, not to Rousseau.) Dickens's scorn for those unnamed individuals, who, like Catlin, he alleged, misguidedly exalted the so-called "noble savage", was limitless. In reality, Dickens maintained, Indians were dirty, cruel, and constantly fighting among themselves. Dickens's satire on Catlin and others like him who might find something to admire in the American Indians or African bushmen is a notable turning point in the history of the use of the phrase.&lt;ref name="ReappraisingDickens'sNobleSavage"&gt;For an account of Dickens's article see Moore, "Reappraising Dickens's 'Noble Savage'" (2002): 236–243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like others who would henceforth write about the topic, Dickens begins by disclaiming a belief in the "noble savage":
{{quotation|To come to the point at once, I beg to say that I have not the least belief in the Noble Savage. I consider him a prodigious nuisance and an enormous superstition. ... I don't care what he calls me. I call him a savage, and I call a savage a something highly desirable to be civilized off the face of the earth.... The noble savage sets a king to reign over him, to whom he submits his life and limbs without a murmur or question and whose whole life is passed chin deep in a lake of blood; but who, after killing incessantly, is in his turn killed by his relations and friends the moment a grey hair appears on his head. All the noble savage's wars with his fellow-savages (and he takes no pleasure in anything else) are wars of extermination—which is the best thing I know of him, and the most comfortable to my mind when I look at him. He has no moral feelings of any kind, sort, or description; and his "mission" may be summed up as simply diabolical.|Charles Dickens&lt;ref name="ReappraisingDickens'sNobleSavage"/&gt;
}}
Dickens' essay was arguably a pose of manly, no-nonsense realism and a defense of Christianity. At the end of it his tone becomes more recognizably humanitarian, as he maintains that, although the virtues of the savage are mythical and his way of life inferior and doomed, he still deserves to be treated no differently than if he were an Englishman of genius, such as Newton or Shakespeare:

{{quotation|To conclude as I began. My position is, that if we have anything to learn from the Noble Savage, it is what to avoid. His virtues are a fable; his happiness is a delusion; his nobility, nonsense. We have no greater justification for being cruel to the miserable object, than for being cruel to a WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE or an ISAAC NEWTON; but he passes away before an immeasurably better and higher power [i.e., that of Christianity] than ever ran wild in any earthly woods, and the world will be all the better when this place knows him no more.|Charles Dickens&lt;ref name="ReappraisingDickens'sNobleSavage"/&gt;
}}

==Scapegoating the Inuit: cannibalism and Sir John Franklin's lost expedition==
Although Charles Dickens had ridiculed positive depictions of Native Americans as portrayals of so-called "noble" savages, he made an exception (at least initially) in the case of the Inuit, whom he called  “loving children of the north”,  “forever happy with their lot,” “whether they are hungry or full”, and “gentle loving savages”, who, despite a tendency to steal, have a “quiet, amiable character” ("Our Phantom Ship on an Antediluvian Cruise", ''Household Words'', April 16, 1851). However he soon reversed this rosy assessment, when on October 23, 1854, ''The Times'' of London published a report by explorer-physician [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]] of the discovery by Eskimos of the remains of the [[Franklin's lost expedition|lost Franklin expedition]] along with unmistakable evidence of cannibalism among members of the party:

{{quotation|From the mutilated state of many of the corpses and the contents of the kettles, it is evident that our wretched countrymen had been driven to the last resource—cannibalism—as a means of prolonging existence.
}}

Franklin's widow and other surviving relatives and indeed the nation as a whole were shocked to the core and refused to accept these reports, which appeared to undermine the whole assumption of the cultural superiority of the heroic white explorer-scientist and the imperial project generally. Instead, they attacked the reliability of the Eskimos who had made the gruesome discovery and called them liars. An editorial in ''The Times'' called for further investigation:

{{quotation|to arrive at a more satisfactory conclusion with regard to the fate of poor Franklin and his friends . ... Is the story told by the Esquimaux the true one? Like all savages they are liars, and certainly would not scruple at the utterance of any falsehood which might, in their opinion, shield them from the vengeance of the white man."&lt;ref&gt;Lillian Nayder, “The Cannibal, the Nurse, and the Cook in Dickens’s ‘The Frozen Deep'”, ''Victorian Literature and Culture'' 19 (1991):1.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

This line was energetically taken up by Dickens, who wrote in his weekly magazine:

{{quotation|It is impossible to form an estimate of the character of any race of savages from their deferential behavior to the white man while he is strong. The mistake has been made again and again; and the moment the white man has appeared in the new aspect of being weaker than the savage, the savage has changed and sprung upon him. There are pious persons who, in their practice, with a strange inconsistency, claim for every child born to civilization all innate depravity, and for every child born to the woods and wilds all innate virtue. We believe every savage to be in his heart covetous, treacherous, and cruel; and we have yet to learn what knowledge the white man—lost, houseless, shipless, apparently forgotten by his race, plainly famine-stricken, weak frozen, helpless, and dying—has of the gentleness of the Esquimaux nature.|Charles Dickens|The Lost Arctic Voyagers, Household Words, December 2, 1854.
}}

Dr. John Rae rebutted Dickens in two articles in ''Household Words'': “The Lost Arctic Voyagers”, ''Household Words'', No. 248 (December 23, 1854), and "Dr. Rae’s Report to the Secretary of the Admiralty", ''Household Words'', No. 249 (December 30, 1854). Though he did not call them noble, Dr. Rae, who had lived among the Inuit, defended them as  “dutiful” and “a bright example to the most civilized people”, comparing them favorably with the undisciplined crew of the Franklin expedition, whom he suggested were ill-treated and "would have mutinied under privation", and moreover with the lower classes in England or Scotland generally.&lt;ref&gt;See Lillian Nayder (1991), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Nadyer notes: In their order of appearance, Dickens’s articles are: 'The Lost Arctic Voyagers,' (December 2, 1854); 'The Lost Arctic Voyagers' (December 9, 1854); 'The Lost English Sailors' (February 14, 1857); and 'Official Patriotism' (April 25, 1857). Dr. Rae’s articles are 'The Lost Arctic Voyagers' (December 23, 1854); 'Dr. Rae’s Report to the Secretary of the Admiralty' (December 30, 1854); and 'Sir John Franklin and His Crews' (February 3, 1855)".}}

Dickens and Wilkie Collins subsequently collaborated on a melodramatic play, "[[The Frozen Deep]]", about the menace of cannibalism in the far north, in which "the villainous role assigned to the Eskimos in ''Household Words'' is assumed by a working class Scotswoman.&lt;ref&gt;(Nayder [1991], p. 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Frozen Deep'' was performed as a benefit organized by Dickens and attended by Queen Victoria, Prince Albert, and Emperor Leopold II of Belgium, among others, to fund a memorial to the Franklin Expedition. (Dr. Rae himself was Scots).

Rae's respect for the Inuit and his refusal to scapegoat them in the Franklin affair arguably harmed his career. Lady Franklin's campaign to glorify the dead of her husband's expedition, aided and abetted by Dickens, resulted in his being more or less shunned by the British establishment. Although it was not Franklin but Rae who in 1848 discovered the last link in the much-sought-after Northwest Passage, Rae was never awarded a knighthood and died in obscurity in London. (In comparison fellow Scot and contemporary explorer David Livingstone was knighted and buried with full imperial honors in Westminster Abbey). However, modern historians have confirmed Rae's discovery of the Northwest Passage and the accuracy of his report on cannibalism among Franklin's crew.&lt;ref&gt;On cannibalism, see, for example: [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article6912227.ece.  Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, "The Arctic heart of darkness: How heroic lies replaced hideous reality after the grim death of John Franklin", ''Times Literary Supplement'', Nov. 11, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian author [[Ken McGoogan]], a specialist on Arctic exploration, states that Rae's willingness to learn and adopt the ways of indigenous Arctic peoples made him stand out as the foremost specialist of his time in cold-climate survival and travel. Rae's respect for Inuit customs, traditions, and skills was contrary to the prejudiced belief of many 19th-century Europeans that native peoples had no valuable technical knowledge or information to impart.&lt;ref&gt;See Ken McGoogan, ''Fatal Passage: The True Story of John Rae, the Arctic Hero Time Forgot'' (New York: Carroll &amp; Graf, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, Orkney and Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael introduced into the UK Parliament a motion proposing that the House "regrets that Dr Rae was never awarded the public recognition that was his due". In March 2009 Carmichael introduced a further motion urging Parliament to formally state it "regrets that memorials to Sir John Franklin outside the Admiralty headquarters and inside Westminster Abbey still inaccurately describe Franklin as the first to discover the [North West] passage, and calls on the Ministry of Defence and the Abbey authorities to take the necessary steps to clarify the true position."

Dickens's racism, like that of many Englishmen, became markedly worse after the [[Sepoy Rebellion]] of 1857 in India.

{{quotation|The cruelties of the Sepoy natives [toward the whites] have inflamed the nation to a degree unprecedented within my memory. Peace Societies, Aborigines Protection Societies, and societies for the reformation of criminals are silent. There is one cry for revenge.|Thomas Babington Macaulay|Diary&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Ellingson (2001), p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

It was said that Dickens's racism, “grew progressively more illiberal over the course of his career".&lt;ref&gt;William Oddie ''Dickens and Carlyle: the Question of Influence'' (London: Centenary) pp. 135–142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Dickens and the Indian Mutiny”, ''Dickensian'' 68 (January 1972), 3–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Myron Magnet, ''Dickens and the Social Order'' (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1985), pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Grace Moore, on the other hand, argues that Dickens, a staunch  abolitionist and opponent of imperialism, had views on racial matters that were a good deal more complex than previous critics have suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Grace Moore, ''Dickens And Empire: Discourses Of Class, Race And Colonialism In The Works Of Charles Dickens (Nineteenth Century Series)'' (Ashgate: 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; This event, and the virtually contemporaneous occurrence of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1864), which threatened to, and then did, put an end to slavery, coincided with a polarization of attitudes exemplified by the phenomenon of [[scientific racism]].

==Scientific racism==
In 1860, [[John Crawfurd]] and [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] mounted a defense of British [[imperialism]] based on "[[scientific racism]]".&lt;ref&gt;See Ellingson (2001), pp. 249–323.&lt;/ref&gt; Crawfurd, in alliance with Hunt, took over the presidency of the [[Ethnological Society of London]], which was an offshoot of the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]], founded with the mission to defend indigenous peoples against slavery and colonial exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1843raigbi.html History page: Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]. The Ethnological Society later merged with the [[Anthropological Society of London]] to form the Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Invoking "science" and "realism", the two men derided their "philanthropic" predecessors for believing in human equality and for not recognizing that mankind was divided into superior and inferior races. Crawfurd, who opposed [[Darwinian evolution]], "denied any unity to mankind, insisting on immutable, hereditary, and timeless differences in racial character, principal amongst which was the 'very great' difference in 'intellectual capacity.'" For Crawfurd, the races had been created separately and were different species. Crawfurd was Scots, and thought the Scots "race" superior to all others; whilst Hunt, on the other hand, believed in the supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon "race". Crawfurd and Hunt routinely accused those who disagreed with them of believing in "Rousseau's Noble Savage". The pair ultimately quarreled because Hunt believed in slavery and Crawfurd did not.{{efn|Hunt went on to found the rival Anthropological Society of London, with a mission of "promoting the study of Anthropology in a strictly scientific manner" and focused on the issue of race. Like the Ethnological Society, Hunt's Anthropological Society later merged into the Royal Anthropological Institute.}} "As Ter Ellingson demonstrates, Crawfurd was responsible for re-introducing the Pre-Rousseauian concept of 'the Noble Savage' to modern anthropology, attributing it wrongly and quite deliberately to Rousseau.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/foreign_bodies/mobile_devices/ch03s02.html |title=John Crawfurd – 'two separate races' | publisher=Epress.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an otherwise rather lukewarm review of Ellingson's book in ''[[Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History]]'' 4:1 (Spring 2003), Frederick E. Hoxie writes:

{{quotation|For early modern scholars from [St. Thomas] More to Rousseau, descriptions of Indian cultures could provide opportunities to criticize “civilization.” After Hunt and Crawfurd—or at least at about the middle of the 19th century, when both imperial ambition and racial ideology was hardening into national policy in Europe and the U.S.—Indians became foils of a different kind: people whose traditions underscored the accomplishments of Europe. The imperial powers were now the models of human achievement. Ellingson sees this shift and shows us how profoundly it affected popular conceptions of Native people.|Frederick E. Hoxie
}}

"If Rousseau was not the inventor of the Noble Savage, who was?" writes Ellingson,

{{quotation|One who turns for help to [Hoxie Neale] Fairchild's 1928 study,&lt;ref&gt;Hoxie Neale Fairchild, ''The Noble Savage: A Study in Romantic Naturalism'' (New York, 1928).&lt;/ref&gt; a compendium of citations from romantic writings on the "savage" may be surprised to find [his book] ''The Noble Savage'' almost completely lacking in references to its nominal subject. That is, although Fairchild assembles hundreds of quotations from ethnographers, philosophers, novelists, poets, and playwrights from the 17th century to the 19th century, showing a rich variety of ways in which writers romanticized and idealized those who Europeans considered "savages", almost none of them explicitly refer to something called the "Noble Savage". Although the words, always duly capitalized, appear on nearly every page, it turns out that in every instance, with four possible exceptions, they are Fairchild's words and not those of the authors cited.&lt;ref&gt;Ellingson (2001), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Ellingson finds that any remotely positive portrayal of an indigenous (or working class) person is apt to be characterized (out of context) as a supposedly "unrealistic" or "romanticized" "Noble Savage". He points out that Fairchild even includes as an example of a supposed "Noble Savage", a picture of a Negro slave on his knees, lamenting lost his freedom. According to Ellingson, Fairchild ends his book with a denunciation of the (always unnamed) believers in primitivism or "The Noble Savage"—who, he feels, are threatening to unleash the dark forces of irrationality on civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Ellingson (2001), p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellingson argues that the term "noble savage", an oxymoron, is a derogatory one, which those who oppose "soft" or romantic primitivism use to discredit (and intimidate) their supposed opponents, whose romantic beliefs they feel are somehow threatening to civilization. Ellingson maintains that virtually none of those accused of believing in the "noble savage" ever actually did so. He likens the practice of accusing anthropologists (and other writers and artists) of belief in the noble savage to a secularized version of the [[inquisition]], and he maintains that modern anthropologists have internalized these accusations to the point where they feel they have to begin by ritualistically disavowing any belief in "noble savage" if they wish to attain credibility in their fields. He notes that text books with a painting of a handsome Native American (such as the one by Benjamin West on this page) are even given to school children with the cautionary caption, "A painting of a Noble Savage". West's depiction is characterized as a typical "noble savage" by art historian Vivien Green Fryd, but her interpretation has been contested.&lt;ref&gt;"British and Indian Identities in a Picture by Benjamin West", Leslie Kaye Reinhardt, ''Eighteenth-Century Studies'' 31: 3 (Spring 1998): 283–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opponents of primitivism==
The most famous modern example of "hard" (or anti-) primitivism in books and movies was [[William Golding]]'s ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', published in 1954. The title is said to be a reference to the Biblical devil, Beelzebub. This book, in which a group of school boys stranded on a desert island "revert" to savage behavior, was a staple of high school and college required reading lists during the Cold War.

In the 1970s, film director [[Stanley Kubrick]] professed his opposition to primitivism. Like Dickens, he began with a disclaimer:

{{quote|Man isn't a noble savage, he's an ignoble savage. He is irrational, brutal, weak, silly, unable to be objective about anything where his own interests are involved—that about sums it up. I'm interested in the brutal and violent nature of man because it's a true picture of him. And any attempt to create social institutions on a false view of the nature of man is probably doomed to failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/film/013072kubrick-profile.html|last=McGregor|first=Craig|title=Nice Boy From the Bronx?|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 30, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The opening scene of Kubrick's movie ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) depicted prehistoric ape-like men wielding weapons of war, as the tools that supposedly lifted them out of their animal state and made them human.

Another opponent of primitivism is the Australian anthropologist [[Roger Sandall]], who has accused other anthropologists of exalting the "noble savage".&lt;ref&gt;For an appraisal of Roger Sandall, see Patrick Wolfe in'' The Anthropological Book Review'', Sept., 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A third is archeologist Lawrence H. Keeley, who has criticised a "widespread myth" that "civilized humans have fallen from grace from a simple primeval happiness, a peaceful golden age" by uncovering archeological evidence that he claims demonstrates that violence prevailed in the earliest human societies. Keeley argues that the "noble savage" paradigm has warped anthropological literature to political ends.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence H. Keeley, ''War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage'' (Oxford, University Press, 1996), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The noble savage is described as having a natural existence. The term ignoble savage has an obvious negative connotation. The ignoble savage is detested—described as having a cruel and primitive existence. Often, the phrase “ignoble savage” was used and abused to justify colonialism. The concept of the ignoble savage gave Europeans the "right" to establish colonies without considering the possibility of preexisting, functional societies.&lt;ref&gt;Ad Borsboom, The Savage In European Social Thought: A Prelude To The Conceptualization Of The Divergent Peoples and Cultures Of Australia and Oceania, KILTV, 1988, 419.&lt;/ref&gt; A prime example would be the use of the [[Discovery Doctrine]] which is still used in the courts of the United States of America.

== In fantasy and science fiction ==
The "noble savage" often maps to uncorrupted races in science fiction and fantasy genres, often deliberately as a contrast to "fallen" more advanced cultures, in films such as ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2009/12/avatar_movie_post.html&lt;/ref&gt; and literature including [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FRiViwMylSUC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=%22Ghân-buri-Ghân%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;lr=&amp;ei=B_ygS8S6MoyaMrTdtdQH&amp;cd=14#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Rutledge, Fleming, ''The Battle for Middle-earth: Tolkien's Divine Design in the Lord of the Rings,''] p. 286, William B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Two very famous noble savage characters in fantasy and science fiction that are very well known are [[Tarzan]] created by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] and [[Conan The Barbarian]] created by [[Robert E. Howard]]. [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]], [[Thongor]] and such are lesser known. Tarzan and Conan are not only known through their literature, but by movie adaptations and other licensed material.

== Noble savage idea today ==
According to critics like the ''[[Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'''s Tim Robey, romantically idealized portrayals of non-industrialized or exotic people persist in popular films, as for example in ''[[The Lone Ranger]]''&lt;ref name=Robey&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/10481755/Tim-Robey-recommends...The-Lone-Ranger.html | title=Tim Robey recommends...The Lone Ranger | publisher=The Telegraph | date=30 November 2013 | accessdate=11 January 2014 | author=Robey, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Dances with Wolves]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=J-jn9p6uuEAC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22 | title=Media Images and Representations | publisher=Infobase Publishing | year=2009 | accessdate=11 January 2014 | author=King, C.

The [[Kurds]] as an ethnicity within the [[Northwestern Iranian]]  group enter the historical record at the end of the seventh century. 

Scholars have suggested different theories for the origin of the [[name of the Kurds|name ''Kurd'']]. According to the [[England|English]] Orientalist Godfrey Rolles Driver, the term ''Kurd'' is related to the Sumerian ''Karda'' which was found from Sumerian clay tablets of the third millennium B.C, while according to other scholars, it predates the Islamic period, as a [[Middle Persian]] word for "nomad", and may ultimately be derived from an ancient toponym or tribal name, either that of the ''[[Cyrtii]]'' or of ''[[Corduene]]''.&lt;ref name=Adamec&gt;{{cite book

==Name==
There are different theories about the origin of name ''Kurd''. According to one theory, it originates in [[Middle Persian]] as 𐭪𐭥𐭫𐭲 ''kwrt-'', a term for "nomad; tent-dweller".{{#tag:ref|Books from the early Islamic era, including those containing legends like the [[Shahnameh]] and the [[Middle Persian]] [[Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan]] and other early Islamic sources provide early attestation of the term ''kurd'' in the sense of "Iranian nomads".
A. The term ''Kurd'' in the Middle Persian documents simply means nomad and tent-dweller and could be attributed to any Iranian ethnic group having similar characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Safrastian, ''Kurds and Kurdistan'', The Harvill Press, 1948, p. 16 and p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
G. "It is clear that kurt in all the contexts has a distinct social sense, "nomad, tent-dweller"."The Pahlavi materials clearly show that kurd in pre-Islamic Iran was a social label, still a long way off from becoming an ethnonym or a term denoting a distinct group of people"&lt;ref&gt;Asatrian, Prolegomena to the Study of the Kurds, Iran and the Caucasus, Vol.13, pp. 1–58, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}
After the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], this term is adopted into Arabic as ''kurd-'', and was used specifically of nomadic tribes.{{#tag:ref|"The ethnic label "Kurd" is first encountered in Arabic sources from the first centuries of the Islamic era; it seemed to refer to a specific variety of pastoral nomadism, and possibly to a set of political units, rather than to a linguistic group: once or twice, "Arabic Kurds" are mentioned. By the 10th century, the term appears to denote nomadic and/or transhumant groups speaking an Iranian language and mainly inhabiting the mountainous areas to the South of Lake Van and Lake Urmia, with some offshoots in the Caucasus...If there was a Kurdish-speaking subjected peasantry at that time, the term was not yet used to include them."&lt;ref name="MartinIdentity"&gt;Martin van Bruinessen, "The ethnic identity of the Kurds", in: ''Ethnic groups in the Republic of Turkey'', compiled and edited by Peter Alford Andrews with Rüdiger Benninghaus [=Beihefte zum Tübinger Atlas des Vorderen Orients, Reihe B, Nr.60]. Wiesbaden: Dr. Ludwich Reichert, 1989, pp. 613–21. [http://www.let.uu.nl/~Martin.vanBruinessen/personal/publications/Bruinessen_Ethnic_identity_Kurds.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

As for the Middle Persian noun ''kwrt-'' originating in an ancient toponym, it has been argued that it may ultimately reflect a Bronze Age toponym ''Qardu'', ''Kar-da'',&lt;ref&gt;Hakan Ozoglu, ''Kurdish notables and the Ottoman State'', 2004, SUNY Press, 186 pp., {{ISBN|0-7914-5993-4}} (See p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt; which may also be reflected in the Arabic (Quranic) toponym
''[[Mount Judi|Ǧūdī]]'' (re-adopted in Kurdish as ''Cûdî'')
&lt;ref&gt;G. S. Reynolds, ''A Reflection on Two Qurʾānic Words (Iblīs and Jūdī), with Attention to the Theories of A. Mingana'', Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 124, No. 4 (October –December , 2004), pp. 675–689. (see p.683, 684 &amp; 687)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ilya Gershevitch, William Bayne Fisher, The Cambridge History of Iran: The Median and Achamenian Periods, 964 pp., Cambridge University Press, 1985, {{ISBN|0-521-20091-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-20091-2}}, (see footnote of p.257)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The name would be continued in classical antiquity as the first element in the toponym ''[[Corduene]]'', and its inhabitants, mentioned by [[Xenophon]] as the tribe of the ''Carduchoi'' who opposed the retreat of the [[Ten Thousand (Greek)|Ten Thousand]] through the mountains north of Mesopotamia in the 4th century BC. This view is supported by some recent academic sources which have considered Corduene as proto-Kurdish region.&lt;ref name="Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian 1989"&gt;Revue des études arméniennes, vol.21, 1988-1989, p.281, By Société des études armeniennes, Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian, Published by Imprimerie nationale, P. Geuthner, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, ''kwrt-'' may be a derivation from the name of the ''[[Cyrtian|Cyrtii]]'' tribe instead.{{#tag:ref|"Evidently, the most reasonable explanation of this ethnonym must be sought for in its possible connections with the Cyrtii (Cyrtaei) of the Classical authors."&lt;ref&gt;G. Asatrian, Prolegomena to the Study of the Kurds, Iran and the Caucasus, Vol.13, pp. 1–58, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

According to some sources, by the 16th century, there seems to develop an ethnic identity designated by the term ''Kurd'' among various Northwestern Iranian groups,{{#tag:ref|The development of the [[Kurdish language]] as a separate dialect group within Northwest Iranian seems to follow a similar time-frame; linguistic innovations characteristic of the Kurdish group date to the New Iranian period (10th century onward). Texts that are identifiably Kurdish first appear in the 16th century.
See Paul (2008):
"Any attempt to study or describe the history of the Kurdish (Kd.) language(s) faces the problem that, from Old and Middle Iranian times, no predecessors of the Kurdish language are yet known; the extant Kurdish texts may be traced back to no earlier than the 16th century CE. [...]
The following sound changes do not—from the available evidence—occur before the NIr. period. The change of postvocalic *-m &gt; -v/-w (N-/C-Kd.) is one of the most characteristic features of Kurdish (e.g., in Kd. nāv/nāw “name”). It occurs also in a small number of other WIr. idioms like Vafsī and in certain N- Balōči dialects"&lt;ref name="Paul_2008"/&gt;

Kurdish scholar [[Mehrdad Izady]] argues that any nomadic groups called ''kurd'' in medieval Arabic are "bona fide ethnic Kurds", and that it is conversely the non-Kurdish groups descended from them who have "acquired separate ethnic identities since the end of the medieval period".{{#tag:ref|"The Kurds mentioned in the classical and medieval sources were bona fide ethnic Kurds, and the forbearers of the modern Kurds and/or those who have acquired separate ethnic identities in the southern Zagros since the end of the medieval period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Izady|first=Mehrdad|title=The Kurds: A Concise Handbook|year=1992|publisher=The Kurds: A Concise History And Fact Book|isbn=978-0844817279|page=185|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I9mr6OgLjBoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Kurds:+A+Concise+Handbook#v=onepage&amp;q=mentioned%20in%20the%20classical&amp;f=false|authorlink=Mehrdad Izady}}&lt;!--Izady is just playing a semantic game of "bona fide ethnic Kurds" being anyone called "Kurd" in the medieval period, and it must be those *no longer* called Kurds who have "acquired a separate identity" rather than assuming a Kurdish ethnogenesis.
This is quotable, but needs to be put in context, as it isn't objective history but rather a political argument intended to maximize the number of Kurds in history. It is "bona fide" to cite this as long as it is made clear that the topic is identity politics rather than philology.--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

[[Sherefxan Bidlisi]] in the 16th century states that there are four division of "Kurds": ''[[Kurmanji Kurds|Kurmanj]]'', ''[[Lurs|Lur]]'', ''[[Kalhor (tribe)|Kalhor]]'' and ''[[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Guran]]'', each of which speak a different dialect or language variation. Paul (2008) notes that the 16th-century usage of the term ''Kurd'' as recorded by Bidlisi, regardless of linguistic grouping, might still reflect an incipient Northwestern Iranian "Kurdish" ethnic identity uniting the Kurmanj, Kalhor, and Guran.{{#tag:ref|Paul (2008) writes about the problem of attaining a coherent definition of "Kurdish language" within the Northwestern Iranian dialect continuum.&lt;ref name="Paul_2008"&gt;Ludwig Paul [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kurdish-language-i "HISTORY OF THE KURDISH LANGUAGE"], ''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
"There is no unambiguous evolution of Kurdish from Middle Iranian, as "from Old and Middle Iranian times, no predecessors of the Kurdish language are yet known; the extant Kurdish texts may be traced back to no earlier than the 16th century CE."
Paul further states:
"Linguistics itself, or dialectology, does not provide any general or straightforward definition of at which point a language becomes a dialect (or vice versa). To attain a fuller understanding of the difficulties and questions that are raised by the issue of the “Kurdish language,” it is therefore necessary to consider also non-linguistic factors."&lt;ref name="Paul_2008"/&gt;|group=Note}}

==Ethnogenesis==
The term ''kurd'' is used in the 16th century by [[Sherefxan Bidlisi]] as encompassing four 
tribal groups,  the ''[[Kurmanji Kurds|Kurmanj]]'', ''[[Lurs|Lur]]'', ''[[Kalhor (tribe)|Kalhor]]'' and ''[[Gorani language (Zaza-Gorani)|Guran]]'', each of which speak a different dialect or language variation. 
Paul (2008) argues that this marks an incipient ethnogenesis of the Kurds as a coherent Northwestern Iranian group, as three out of these four groups can be identified as the ancestors of groups that at least partially identify as Kurdish today, while the ''Lurs'' are not a Kurdish group, and indeed do not belong to the Northwest Iranian but to the [[Southwestern Iranian]] linguistic phylum.
Paul further notes that the first texts that identifiably are written in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] appear during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Paul [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kurdish-language-i   "HISTORY OF THE KURDISH LANGUAGE"], ''[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]'' (2008) writes about the problem of attaining a coherent definition of "Kurdish language" within the Northwestern Iranian dialect continuum. 
There is no unambiguous evolution of Kurdish from Middle Iranian, as "from Old and Middle Iranian times, no predecessors of the Kurdish language are yet known; the extant Kurdish texts may be traced back to no earlier than the 16th century CE."
Ludwig further states:
"Linguistics itself, or dialectology, does not provide any general or straightforward definition of at which point a language becomes a dialect (or vice versa). To attain a fuller understanding of the difficulties and questions that are raised by the issue of the “Kurdish language,” it is therefore necessary to consider also non-linguistic factors."&lt;/ref&gt;

Akrād ) was beginning to be applied to an amalgamation of Iranian or iranicised tribes. Among the latter, some were autochthonous (the Ḳardū; the Tmorik̲h̲/Ṭamurāyē in the district of which Alḳī = Elk was the capital; the Χοθα̑ίται [= al-Ḵh̲uwayt̲h̲iyya] in the canton of Ḵh̲oyt of Sāsūn, the Orṭāyē [= al-Arṭān] in the bend of the Euphrates); some were Semites (cf. the popular genealogies of the Kurd tribes) and some probably Armenian (it is said that the Mamakān tribe is of Mamikonian origin)." Excerpt 4: "In the 20th century, the existence of an Iranian non-Kurdish element among the Kurds has been definitely established (the Gūrān-Zāzā group)."&lt;/ref&gt; 
including [[Lullubi]],&lt;ref name="bois"&gt;Thomas Bois, ''The Kurds'', 159 pp., 1966.

Dandamaev considers [[Carduchi]] (who were from the upper Tigris near the Assyrian and Median borders) less likely than [[Cyrtians]] as ancestors of modern Kurds. Encyclopedia Iranica, "Carduchi" by M. Dandamayev Excerpt: "It has repeatedly been argued that the Carduchi were the ancestors of the Kurds, but the Cyrtii (Kurtioi) mentioned by Polybius, Livy, and Strabo (see MacKenzie, pp. 68–69) are more likely candidates." 
However according to McDowall, the term Cyrtii was first applied to [[Seleucid]] or [[Parthia]]n mercenary slingers from [[Zagros]], and it is not clear if it denoted a coherent linguistic or ethnic group.

In the [[phonology|phonological]] system of the Khorasani [[Kurmanji]], the Armenian trace is also visible. Also, after winnowing, when the work on the thrashing-floor is over, some groups of the Khorasani Kurds draw a cross-sign on the grain heaps cleaned from the husk, thus rendering homage to an old tradition"&lt;/ref&gt;

While various predecessor groups that may have contributed to Kurdish ethnogenesis are of intractable antiquity (the [[Gutians]] being a people of the [[Middle Bronze Age]]),&lt;ref&gt;According to J.P. Mallory, the original Gutians precede the arrival of [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] peoples (of which the Kurds are one) by some 1500 years.Mallory, J.P. (1989), In Search of the Indo-Europeans: Language, Archaeology, and Myth, London: Thames &amp; Hudson&lt;/ref&gt; the emergence of the Kurds as speakers of an identifiably Northwestern Iranian language (viz. [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]) necessarily post-dates the unity of the Northwestern branch.

19th-century scholars, such as [[George Rawlinson]], identified Corduene and Carduchi with the modern Kurds, considering that ''Carduchi'' was the ancient lexical equivalent of "[[Kurdistan]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson, George, ''The Seven Great Monarchies Of The Ancient Eastern World, Vol 7'', 1871.

There were numerous forms of this name, partly due to the difficulty of representing ''kh'' in Latin. The spelling ''Karduchoi'' is itself probably borrowed from [[Armenian language|Armenian]], since the termination ''-choi'' represents the Armenian language plural suffix ''-kh''.&lt;ref&gt;M.Th. Houtsma, ''E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913-1936'', {{ISBN|90-04-08265-4}}, see p.1133&lt;/ref&gt;
It is speculated that Carduchi spoke an [[Iranian languages|Old Iranian]] language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/eieol/aveol-0-X.html] ref&gt;M. Chahin, Before the Greeks, p. 109, James Clarke &amp; Co., 1996, {{ISBN|0-7188-2950-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewish sources trace origins of people of Corduene to marriage of Jinns of [[King Solomon]] with 500 beautiful Jewish women.&lt;ref&gt;Baron Patrick Balfour Kinross, Within the Taurus: a journey in Asiatic Turkey, 1970, 191 pages, see p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Smith, The Cornhill Magazine, Volume 167, 1954, sp. 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schäfer, Catherine Hezser, The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman Culture, Volume 3, Mohr Siebeck, 2002 – 486 pages, s p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Büchler, Studies in Jewish history, Oxford University Press, 1956, 279 pages, s p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israel Abrahams, Adolf Büchler, The Foundations of Jewish life: three studies, Arno Press, 1973, 512 pages, s p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The same legend was also used by the early Islamic authorities to explain origins of Kurds.

Gershevitch and Fisher consider the independent [[Carduchi|Kardouchoi]] or Carduchi as the ancestors of the Kurds, or at least the original nucleus of the Iranian-speaking people in what is now Kurdistan.&lt;ref name="Ilya Gershevitch 1985, p.257" /&gt;

The [[Medes]] have often been believed to be a starting point for Kurdish (as well as [[Baloch people|Baloch]]) ethnogesis. This would leave about a millennium of separate development between the collapse of the Median Empire and the first historical mention of the Kurds as an identifiable ethnic group.

The Median hypothesis was advanced by   [[Vladimir Minorsky]]  {{year needed|date=October 2014}}. 
I. Gershevitch who provided first "a piece of linguistic confirmation" of Minorsky's identification and then another "sociolinguistic" argument.
[[Gernot Windfuhr]] (1975)   identified [[Kurdish dialects]] as [[Parthian language|Parthian]], albeit with a [[Median language|Median]] substratum.&lt;ref&gt;Windfuhr, Gernot (1975), “Isoglosses: A Sketch on Persians and Parthians, Kurds and Medes”, Monumentum H.S. Nyberg II (Acta Iranica-5), Leiden: 457–471&lt;/ref&gt;

Median descent of the Kurds has found favour as a historical narrative among Kurds in the 20th century, so that identification of Kurds as Medes is now common in Kurdish nationalist sentiment, though some experts believe it is incorrect.

The hypothesis is not without its detractors, among them  [[Martin van Bruinessen]] (2004).&lt;ref name="Ozoglu25"&gt;Hakan Özoğlu, ''Kurdish notables and the Ottoman state: Evolving Identities, Competing Loyalties, and Shifting Boundaries'', SUNY Press, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CttLWEaTrJUC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22many+Kurdish+nationalists+in+the+twentieth+century%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0TQ_TpexHKWImQXU-dSSCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22many%20Kurdish%20nationalists%20in%20the%20twentieth%20century%22&amp;f=false p. 25.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Asatrian (2009) stated that "The Central Iranian dialects, and primarily those of the Kashan area in the first place, as well as the Azari dialects (otherwise called Southern Tati) are probably the only Iranian dialects, which can pretend to be the direct offshoots of Median ... In general, the relationship between Kurdish and Median are not closer than the affinities between the latter and other North Western dialects — Baluchi, Talishi, South Caspian, Zaza, Gurani, etc."&lt;ref&gt;G. Asatrian, ''Prolegomena to the Study of the Kurds'', Iran and the Caucasus, Vol. 13, pp. 1–58, 2009. (p. 21 [https://archive.org/stream/ProlegomenaToTheStudyOfTheKurds/Asatrian_kurds_djvu.txt])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin legends==
[[File:Ararat Ms. 11639 521a.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[Noah's ark]] landing on the  mountain top, from the [[North French Hebrew Miscellany]] (13th century)]]

There are multiple legends that detail the origins of the Kurds. One details the Kurds as being the descendants of [[King Solomon]]’s angelic servants ([[Djinn]]). These were sent to Europe to bring him five-hundred beautiful maidens, for the king's harem. However, when these had done so and returned to Israel the king had already died. As such, the Djinn settled in the mountains, married the women themselves, and their offspring came to be known as the Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, M. (1980). ''Children of the Jinn: in Search of the Kurds and their Country''. Michigan: Seaview Books, pp. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in the legend of [[Newroz]], an evil Assyrian king named [[Zahak]], who had two snakes growing out of his shoulders, had conquered Iran, and terrorized its subjects; demanding daily sacrifices in the form of young men's brains. Unknowingly to Zahak, the cooks of the palace saved one of the men, and mixed the brains of the other with those of a sheep. The men that were saved were told to flee to the mountains. Hereafter, [[Kaveh the Blacksmith]], who had already lost several of his children to Zahak, trained the men in the mountains, and stormed Zahak’s palace, severing the heads of the snakes and killing the tyrannical king. Kaveh was instilled as the new king, and his followers formed the beginning of the Kurdish people.&lt;ref&gt;Masudi. ''Les Prairies d’Or''. Trans. Barbier de Meynard and Pavet de Courteille, 9 vols. Paris: La Société Asiatique, 1861.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Özoglu, H. (2004). ''Kurdish Notables and the Ottoman State: Evolving Identities, Competing Loyalties, and Shifting Boundaries''. Albany: State University of New York Press, pp. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the writings of the Ottoman Turkish traveller [[Evliya Çelebi]], there's also a legend concerning the Kurds to be found. He states to have learned of this legend from a certain ''Mighdisî'', an Armenian historian:

{{quote|According to the chronicler Mighdisî, the first town to be built after Noah's Flood was the town of Judi, followed by the fortresses of Sinjar and Mifariqin. The town of Judi was ruled by Melik Kürdim of the Prophet Noah's community, a man who lived no less than 600 years and who travelled the length and width of Kurdistan. Coming to Mifariqin he liked its climate and settled there, begetting many children and descendants. He invented a language of his own, independent of Hebrew. It is neither Hebrew nor Arabic, [[Persian language|Persian]], Dari or Pahlavi; they still call it the language of Kürdim. So the Kurdish language, which was invented in Mifariqin and is now used throughout Kurdistan, owes its name to Melik Kürdim of the community of the Prophet Noah. Because Kurdistan is an endless stony stretch of mountains, there are no less than twelve varieties of Kurdish, differing from one another in pronunciation and vocabulary, so that they often have to use interpreters to understand one another's words.&lt;ref&gt;Van Bruinessen, M. (2000). Kurdistan in the 16th and 17th centuries, as reflected in Evliya Çelebi’s Seyahatname. ''The Journal of Kurdish Studies'', 3.1:1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

In [[music]], an '''ostinato''' {{IPA-it|ostiˈnaːto|}} (derived from Italian: ''stubborn'', compare English, from Latin: 'obstinate') is a [[motif (music)|motif]] or [[phrase (music)|phrase]] that persistently [[repetition (music)|repeats]] in the same musical [[part (music)|voice]], frequently in the same pitch. Well-known ostinato-based pieces include both [[classical music|classical]] compositions such as [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[Boléro]]'' and [[popular music|popular]] songs such as [[Donna Summer]] and [[Giorgio Moroder]]'s "[[I Feel Love]]" (1977), Henry Mancini's theme from ''Peter Gunn'' (1959), [[The Verve]]'s "[[Bitter Sweet Symphony]]" (1997),&lt;ref&gt;Bufe, Chaz (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[April Ivy]]'s "[[Be Ok]]" (1997).&lt;ref&gt;Portuguese (2016).''An Understandable Guide to Music Theory: The Most Useful Aspects of Theory for Rock, Jazz, and Blues Musicians'', p. 59. {{ISBN|9781884365003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rutter |first= Paul |date= 2010 |title= The Music Industry Handbook |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=srusAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= London |publisher= [[Routledge]] |page= 78 |isbn= 9781136725074 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In RCM ([[Royal Conservatory of Music]]), a level 8 theory definition for the term "ostinato" would be referred to as "a recurring rhythmic or melodic pattern". The repeating idea may be a [[rhythm]]ic pattern, part of a tune, or a complete [[melody]] in itself.&lt;ref name="Kamien"&gt;[[Roger Kamien|Kamien, Roger]] (1258). ''Music: An Appreciation'', p. 611. {{ISBN|0-07-284484-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both ''ostinatos'' and ''ostinati'' are accepted English plural forms, the latter reflecting the word's Italian [[etymology]]. Strictly speaking, ostinati should have exact [[repetition (music)|repetition]], but in common usage, the term covers repetition with [[Variation (music)|variation]] and [[Musical development|development]], such as the alteration of an ostinato line to fit changing [[harmony|harmonies]] or [[Key (music)|keys]]. 

{{quote|If the cadence may be regarded as the cradle of tonality, the ostinato patterns can be considered the playground in which it grew strong and self-confident.|Edward E. Lewinsky&lt;ref&gt;Bella Brover-Lubovsky (2008). ''Tonal space in the music of Antonio Vivaldi'', p. 151. {{ISBN|0-253-35129-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Within the context of film music, Claudia Gorbman defines an ''ostinato'' as a repeated melodic or rhythmic figure that propels scenes that lack dynamic visual action.&lt;ref&gt;Gorbman, Claudia. "Film Music". ''Film Studies: Critical Approaches''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 2000. p. 43. {{ISBN|0-19-874280-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ostinato plays an important part in [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] music (rock and jazz), in which it is often referred to as a ''riff'' or a ''vamp''. A "favorite technique of contemporary jazz writers", ostinati are often used in [[Modal jazz|modal]] and [[Latin jazz]] and traditional [[African music]] including [[Gnawa music]].&lt;ref name="Rawlins"&gt;Rawlins, Robert (2005). ''Jazzology: The Encyclopedia of Jazz Theory for All Musicians'', pp. 132–133. {{ISBN|0-634-08678-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "ostinato" has essentially the same meaning as the medieval Latin word "''pes''", the word "ground" as applied to classical music, and the word "riff" in contemporary popular music.

==Classical music==
''Ostinati'' are used in 20th-century music to stabilize groups of pitches, as in Stravinsky's ''The Rite of Spring'' ''Introduction'' and ''Augurs of Spring''.&lt;ref name="Kamien" /&gt; A famous type of ostinato, called the ''[[Rossini]] crescendo'', owes its name to a [[crescendo]] that underlies a persistent musical pattern, which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza. This style was emulated by other bel canto composers, especially [[Vincenzo Bellini]]; and later by [[Wagner]] (in pure instrumental terms, discarding the closing vocal cadenza).

Applicable in [[Homophony|homophonic]] and [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] [[Texture (music)|textures]] they are "repetitive rhythmic-harmonic schemes", more familiar as accompanimental melodies, or purely rhythmic.&lt;ref name="DeLone"&gt;DeLone, Richard (1975). "Timbre and Texture in Twentieth-Century Music", ''Aspects of 20th Century Music'', p. 123. Wittlich, Gary (ed.). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-049346-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The technique's appeal to composers from Debussy to [[Experimental music|avant-garde]] composers until at least the 1970s "... lies in part in the need for unity created by the virtual abandonment of functional [[chord progression]]s to shape phrases and define tonality".&lt;ref name="DeLone" /&gt; Similarly, in [[Musical mode|modal]] music, "... relentless, repetitive character help to establish and confirm the modal center".&lt;ref name="Rawlins" /&gt; Their popularity may also be justified by their ease as well as range of use, though, "... ostinato must be employed judiciously, as its overuse can quickly lead to monotony".&lt;ref name="Rawlins" /&gt;

===Medieval===
Ostinato patterns have been present in European music from the Middle Ages onwards.  In the famous English [[Canon (music)|canon]] "[[Sumer Is Icumen In]]", the main vocal lines are underpinned by an ostinato pattern, known as a ''pes'':[[File:Sumer is Icumen in.png|thumb|center|500px|[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMCA9nYnLWo Sumer is Icumen in]]]

Later in the medieval era, [[Guillaume Dufay|Dufay]]’s 15th century chanson ''Resvelons Nous'' features a similarly constructed ostinato pattern, but this time 5 bars long.  Over this, the main melodic line moves freely, varying the phrase-lengths, while being “to some extent predetermined by the repeating pattern of the canon in the lower two voices.”&lt;ref&gt; Fallows, D. (1982, p. 89). Dufay.  London, Dent. &lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Dufay Resvelons nous 01.wav|thumb|Dufay Resvelons nous]][[File:Dufay Resvelons nous 02.png|thumb|center|500px|[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zD8LoZti7g Dufay Resvelons nous]]]

===Ground Bass: Late Renaissance and Baroque===

{{anchor|Ground bass}}

''Ground bass'' or ''basso ostinato'' (obstinate bass) is a type of [[variation form]] in which a [[bass line]], or [[chord progression|harmonic pattern]] (see [[Chaconne]]; also common in [[Music in the Elizabethan era|Elizabethan England]] as ''Grounde'') is repeated as the basis of a piece underneath variations.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlette, Christopher, and Steven G. Laitz (2010). ''Graduate Review of Tonal Theory''. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 230 {{ISBN|978-0-19-537698-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Copland]]&lt;ref&gt;Copland, Aaron and Rich, Alan (2002). ''What to Listen for in Music'', p. 117. {{ISBN|0-451-52867-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; describes basso ostinato as "... the easiest to recognize" of the variation forms wherein, "... a long phrase—either an accompanimental figure or an actual melody—is repeated over and over again in the bass part, while the upper parts proceed normally [with variation]". However, he cautions, "it might more properly be termed a musical device than a musical form."

One striking ostinato instrumental piece of the late Renaissance period is “The Bells”, a piece for [[virginals]] by [[William Byrd]].  Here the ostinato (or ‘ground’) consists of just two notes:[[File:William Byrd, The Bells 01.wav|thumb|William Byrd, The Bells]][[File:William Byrd, The Bells 02.png|thumb|center|500px|William Byrd, The Bells]]

In Italy, during the seventeenth century, [[Claudio Monteverdi]] composed many pieces using ostinato patterns in his operas and sacred works.  One of these was his 1650 version of “Laetatus sum”, an imposing setting of Psalm 122 that pits a four note “ostinato of unquenchable energy.”&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, D (1978, p81) Monteverdi: sacred, Secular and Occasional Music.  New Jersey, Associated University Presses. &lt;/ref&gt; against both voices and instruments:[[File:Monteverdi Laetatus sum (1650) Ground bass.png|thumb|center|500px|Monteverdi Laetatus sum (1650) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekGB_HZRJMI Ground bass]]]

Later in the same century, [[Henry Purcell]] became famous for his skilful deployment of ground bass patterns.  His most famous ostinato is the descending [[chromatic]] ground bass that underpins the Lament at the end of his opera ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'':[[File:Purcell, Dido's Lament ground bass 01.wav|thumb|Purcell, Dido's Lament ground bass]][[File:Purcell, Dido's Lament ground bass 02.png|thumb|center|500px|Purcell, Dido's Lament ground bass]] While the use of a descending chromatic scale to express pathos was fairly common at the end of the seventeenth century, Richard Taruskin points out that Purcell shows a fresh approach to this musical [[Trope (literature)|trope]]: “Altogether unconventional and characteristic, however, is the interpolation of an additional cadential measure into the stereotyped ground, increasing its length from a routine four to a haunting five bars, against which the vocal line, with its despondent refrain (‘Remember me!’), is deployed with marked asymmetry.  That, plus Purcell’s distinctively dissonant, suspension-saturated harmony, enhanced by additional chromatic descents during the final ritornello and by many deceptive cadences, makes this little aria an unforgettably poignant embodiment of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGQq3HcOB0Y&amp;t=0m56s heartache].”&lt;ref&gt; Taruskin, R. (2010, p.13&amp;) The Oxford History of Western Music: Music in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth centuries.  Oxford University Press. &lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Lament bass]].

However, this is not the only ostinato pattern that Purcell uses in the opera.  Dido’s opening aria “Ah, Belinda” is a further demonstration of Purcell’s technical mastery: the phrases of the vocal line do not always coincide with the 4-bar ground:[[File:Dido's opening aria "Ah! Belinda".png|thumb|center|500px|Dido's opening aria [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6upHhJg6t8 "Ah! Belinda"]]]

“Purcell’s compositions over a ground vary in their working out, and the repetition never becomes a restriction.”&lt;ref&gt; Harris, Ellen T. (1987, p108) Henry Purcell’s Dido and Aeneas. Oxford, Clarendon Press. &lt;/ref&gt; Purcell’s instrumental music also featured ground patterns.  A particularly fine and complex example is his Fantasia upon a Ground for three violins and continuo: [[File:Purcell Fantasia in 3 parts to a ground.png|thumb|center|500px|Purcell Fantasia in 3 parts to a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOLsVkf_4Gs ground]]]

The intervals in the above pattern are found in many works of the Baroque Period.  ''[[Pachelbel's Canon]]'' also uses a similar sequence of notes in the bass part:[[File:Pachelbel's Canon 01.wav|thumb|Pachelbel's Canon]] [[File:Pachelbel Canon bass line (quarter notes).svg|thumb|center|Ground bass of ''[[Pachelbel's Canon]]'']]

Two pieces by [[J.S.Bach]] are particularly striking for their use of an ostinato bass: the [[Mass in B minor structure#Crucifixus|Crucifixus]] from his [[Mass in B minor]] and the [[Passacaglia]] in C minor for organ, which has a ground rich in melodic intervals:[[File:Bach C minor Passacaglia ground bass.wav|thumb|Bach C minor Passacaglia ground bass]][[File:Bach C minor Passacaglia ground bass.png|thumb|center|500px|Bach C minor Passacaglia ground bass]] The first variation that Bach builds over this ostinato consists of a gently [[syncopated]] motif in the upper voices:[[File:Bach C minor Passacaglia Variation 1.wav|thumb|Bach C minor Passacaglia Variation 1]][[File:Bach C minor Passacaglia Variation 1.png|thumb|center|500px|Bach C minor Passacaglia Variation 1]] This characteristic rhythmic pattern continues in the second variation, but with some engaging harmonic subtleties, especially in the second bar, where an unexpected chord creates a passing implication of a related key: [[File:Bach C minor Passacaglia Variation 2.wav|thumb|Bach C minor Passacaglia Variation 2]][[File:Bach C minor Passacaglia Variation 2.png|thumb|center|500px|Bach C minor Passacaglia Variation 2]] In common with other Passacaglias of the era, the ostinato is not simply confined to the bass, but rises to the uppermost part later in the piece:[[File:Bach C minor Passacaglia variation with ostinato in treble.wav|thumb|Bach C minor Passacaglia variation with ostinato in treble]][[File:Bach C minor Passacaglia with ostinato in treble.png|thumb|center|500px|Bach C minor Passacaglia with ostinato in treble]] A performance of the entire piece can be heard [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ie52xH8V2L4 here].

===Late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries===

Ostinatos feature in many works of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. [[Mozart]] uses an ostinato phrase throughout the big scene that ends Act 2 of the [[The Marriage of Figaro|''Marriage of Figaro'']], to convey a sense of suspense as the jealous Count Almaviva tries in vain to incriminate the Countess, his wife, and Figaro, his butler, for plotting behind his back. A famous type of ostinato, called the [[Rossini]] crescendo, owes its name to a crescendo that underlies a persistent musical pattern, which usually culminates in a solo vocal cadenza.

In the energetic Scherzo of [[Beethoven]]’s late [[String Quartet No. 14 (Beethoven)|C sharp minor Quartet, Op. 131]], there is a harmonically static passage, with “the repetitiveness of a nursery rhyme”&lt;ref&gt; Radcliffe, .P (1965, p.158) Beethoven’s String Quartets.  London, Hutchinson. &lt;/ref&gt; that consists of an ostinato shared between viola and cello supporting a melody in octaves in the first and second violins:[[File:Beethoven Op 131 Trio from Scherzo, bars 69-76.wav|thumb|Beethoven Op 131 Trio from Scherzo, bars 69–76]][[File:Beethoven Op 131 Trio from Scherzo, bars 69-76.png|thumb|center|500px|Beethoven Op 131 Trio from Scherzo, bars 69–76]] Beethoven reverses this relationship a few bars later with the melody in the viola and cello and the ostinato shared between the violins:[[File:Beethoven Op 131 Trio from Scherzo, bars 93-100.wav|thumb|Beethoven Op 131 Trio from Scherzo, bars 93–100]][[File:Beethoven Op 131 Trio from Scherzo, bars 93-100.png|thumb|center|500px|Beethoven Op 131 Trio from Scherzo, bars 93–100]]

Both the first and third acts of [[Wagner]]’s final opera ''[[Parsifal]]'' feature a passage accompanying a scene where a band of Knights solemnly processes from the depths of forest to the hall of the Grail.  The “Transformation music” that supports this change of scene is dominated by the iterated tolling of four bells:[[File:Wagner, Parsifal Act 1, transformation music.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Parsifal Act 1, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTraCEg0x68&amp;t=05m0s transformation music]]] [[Brahms]] used ostinato patterns in both the finale of his [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Fourth Symphony]] and in the closing section of his ''[[Variations on a Theme by Haydn]]'': [[File:Brahms Variations on a Theme by Haydn, final section with ground bass.png|thumb|center|500px|Brahms Variations on a Theme by Haydn, final section with [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5Wm_MFnAto&amp;t=13m15s ground bass]]]

===Twentieth century===
[[Debussy]] featured an ostinato pattern throughout his Piano Prelude [[Des pas sur la neige|“Des pas sur la Neige”]].  Here, the ostinato pattern stays in the middle register of the piano&amp;nbsp;– it is never used as a bass.  “Remark that the footfall ostinato remains nearly throughout on the same notes, at the same pitch level... this piece is an appeal to the basic loneliness of all human beings, oft-forgotten perhaps, but, like the ostinato, forming a basic undercurrent of our history.”&lt;ref&gt; Schmitz, E. R. (1950, pp.&amp;nbsp;145–7) the Piano Works of Claude Debussy. New York, Dover. &lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Debussy, Des pas sur la neige.png|thumb|center|500px|Debussy, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eym3nCRxev0 Des pas sur la neige]]] Of all the major classical composers of the Twentieth Century, [[Stravinsky]] is possibly the one most associated with the practice of ostinato.  In conversation with the composer, his friend and colleague [[Robert Craft]] remarked “Your music always has an element of repetition, of ostinato.  What is the function of ostinato?”  Stravinsky replied; “It is static&amp;nbsp;– that is, anti-development; and sometimes we need a contradiction to development.”&lt;ref&gt; Stravinsky, I. and Craft R. (1959, p.42) ''Conversations with Igor Stravinsky''.  London, Faber. &lt;/ref&gt; Stravinsky was particularly skilled at using ostinatos to confound rather than confirm rhythmic expectations.  In the first of his [[Three Pieces for String Quartet (Stravinsky)|''Three Pieces for String Quartet'']], Stravinsky sets up three repeated patterns, which overlap one another and never [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUepDjGgUnc coincide]. "Here a rigid pattern of (3+2+2/4) bars is laid over a strictly recurring twenty-three-beat tune (the bars being marked by a cello ostinato), so that their changing relationship is governed primarily by the pre-compositional scheme."&lt;ref&gt; Walsh, S. (1988, p57) The Music of Stravinsky. London, Routledge. &lt;/ref&gt; “The rhythmical current running through the music is what binds together these curious mosaic-like pieces.”&lt;ref&gt; Vlad, R (1978, p52) Stravinsky.  Oxford University Press. &lt;/ref&gt;

A subtler metrical conflict can be found in the final section of Stravinsky’s ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]''.  The choir sing a melody in triple time, while the bass instruments in the orchestra play a 4-beat ostinato against this.  “This is built up over an ostinato bass (harp, two pianos and timpani) moving in fourths like a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqWZGUO_eoc&amp;t=15m39s pendulum]."&lt;ref&gt; White, E.W. (1979, p.365) Stravinsky: the Composer and his Works. London, Faber. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-Saharan African music==
[[File:Gyil.JPG|thumb|left|310px|Ghanaian gyil]]

===Counter-metric structure===
Many instruments [[Sub-Saharan African music traditions|south of the Sahara Desert]] play ostinato melodies.{{clarify|date=June 2017}} These include [[lamellophone]]s such as the [[mbira]], as well as [[xylophone]]s like the [[balafon]], the [[bikutsi]], and the [[xylophone|gyil]]. Ostinato figures are also played on string instruments such as the [[Kora (instrument)|kora]], [[gankoqui]] bell ensembles, and pitched drums ensembles. Often, African ostinatos contain [[offbeat (music)|offbeat]]s or [[cross-beat]]s, that contradict the metric structure.&lt;ref&gt;Peñalosa, David (2010). ''The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins'' pp. 22–26, 62. Redway, CA: Bembe Inc. {{ISBN|1-886502-80-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other African ostinatos generate complete cross-rhythms by sounding both the main [[beat music|beat]]s and cross-beats. In the following example, a gyil sounds the three-against-two cross-rhythm ([[hemiola]]). The left hand (lower notes) sounds the two main beats, while the right hand (upper notes) sounds the three cross-beats.&lt;ref&gt;Peñalosa, David (2010). ''The Clave Matrix'' p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ghanaian gyil.jpg|thumb|center|300px|Ghanaian gyil cross-rhythmic ostinato {{audio|Ghanaian gyil.mid|Play}}]]

===African harmonic progressions===
Popular dance bands in West Africa and the [[Congo (area)|Congo region]] feature ostinato playing guitars. The African guitar parts have drawn from a variety of sources, including the indigenous [[mbira]], as well as foreign influences such as [[James Brown]]-type [[funk]] riffs. However, the foreign influences are interpreted through a distinctly African ostinato sensibility. African guitar styles began with Congolese bands doing Cuban "cover" songs. The Cuban [[guajeo]] had a both familiar and exotic quality to the African musicians. Gradually, various regional guitar styles emerged, as indigenous influences became increasingly dominant within these ''Africanized guajeos''.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, John Storm. ''Afro-Cuban Comes Home: The Birth of Congo Music''. Original Music cassette tape (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

As Moore states, "One could say that I&amp;nbsp;– IV&amp;nbsp;– V&amp;nbsp;– IV [chord progressions] is to African music what the 12-bar blues is to North American music."&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Kevin (2011). ''Ritmo Oriental's First Album of the 70s''. Web. ''Timba.com''. http://www.timba.com/artist_pages/1974-first-lp-of-the-70s&lt;/ref&gt; Such progressions seem superficially to follow the conventions of Western music theory. However, performers of African popular music do not perceive these progressions in the same way. Harmonic progressions which move from the tonic to the subdominant (as they are known in European music) have been used in [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony]] for hundreds of years. Their elaborations follow all the conventions of traditional African harmonic principles. Gehard Kubik concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The harmonic cycle of C–F–G–F [I–IV–V–IV] prominent in Congo/Zaire popular music simply cannot be defined as a progression from tonic to subdominant to dominant and back to subdominant (on which it ends) because in the performer's appreciation they are of equal status, and not in any hierarchical order as in Western music—(Kubik 1999).&lt;ref&gt;Kubik, Gerhard (1999). ''Africa and the Blues''. Jackson, MI: University Press of Mississippi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Afro-Cuban guajeo==
A [[guajeo]] is a typical Cuban ostinato melody, most often consisting of arpeggiated chords in syncopated patterns. The guajeo is a hybrid of the African and European ostinato. The guajeo was first played as accompaniment on the tres in the folkloric [[changüí]] and [[son music|son]].&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus, Ben (2008). ''Origins of Cuban Music and Dance; Changüí'' p. 16–18. Lanham, MA: Scarecrow Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8108-6204-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''guajeo'' is often used to mean specific ostinato patterns played by a tres, piano, an instrument of the violin family, or saxophones.&lt;ref&gt;Mauleón, Rebeca (1993) ''Salsa Guidebook for Piano and Ensemble''. p. 255. Petaluma, California: Sher Music. {{ISBN|0-9614701-9-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The guajeo is a fundamental component of modern-day [[salsa music|salsa]], and [[Latin jazz]]. The following example shows a basic guajeo pattern.

[[File:Generic 3-2 guajeo.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Cuban guajeo written in cut-time {{audio|Generic 3-2 guajeo.mid|Play}}]]

The guajeo is a seamless Afro-Euro ostinato hybrid, which has had a major influence upon jazz, R&amp;B, [[rock 'n' roll]] and popular music in general. The [[Beatles]]' "[[I Feel Fine]]" guitar riff is guajeo-like.

==Riff==
{{redirect|Riff|other uses|Riff (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Iron Man riff.svg|thumb|center|400px|The riff from [[Black Sabbath]]'s "[[Iron Man (song)|Iron Man]]" {{audio|Iron Man riff.mid|Play}} is characteristic of Rooksby's description: only four measures repeated, played low on a guitar as part of a heavy metal (rock) arrangement.]]

[[File:Radiohead "Creep" ostinato.png|thumb|center|400px|Ostinato from [[Radiohead]]'s "[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]" features [[modal mixture]], [[common tone (chord)|common tones]] between adjacent triads (B between G &amp; B, C and G between C[[Macro analysis|+]] &amp; C−), and an emphasis on [[subdominant]] harmony (IV = C in G major).&lt;ref name="Capuzzo"&gt;Capuzzo, Guy. ''Neo-Riemannian Theory and the Analysis of Pop-Rock Music'', pp. 186–87, ''Music Theory Spectrum'', Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 177–199. Autumn 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In various popular music styles, ''riff'' refers to a brief, relaxed phrase repeated over changing melodies. It may serve as a refrain or [[melody|melodic figure]], often played by the [[rhythm section]] instruments or solo instruments that form the basis or [[accompaniment]] of a musical composition.&lt;ref&gt;''New Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (1986) p. 708. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Though they are most often found in [[rock music]], [[heavy metal music]], [[Latin American music|Latin]], [[funk]] and [[jazz]], classical music is also sometimes based on a simple riff, such as [[Ravel]]'s [[Boléro]]. Riffs can be as simple as a tenor saxophone honking a simple, catchy rhythmic figure, or as complex as the riff-based variations in the [[head (music)|head]] [[arrangement]]s played by the [[Count Basie Orchestra]].

David Brackett (1999) defines riffs as, "short melodic phrases", while [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]] (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Middleton| first = Richard| origyear = 1990 | year = 2002| title = Studying Popular Music| location = Philadelphia| publisher = Open University Press| isbn = 0-335-15275-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines them as "short rhythmic, melodic, or harmonic figures repeated to form a structural framework". Rikky Rooksby&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Rooksby| first = Rikky| year= 2002| title = Riffs: How to create and play great guitar riffs| location = San Francisco| publisher = Backbeat Books| isbn = 0-87930-710-2| pages = 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; states, "A riff is a short, repeated, memorable musical phrase, often pitched low on the guitar, which focuses much of the energy and excitement of a rock song."

[[BBC Radio 2]], in compiling its list of 100 Greatest Guitar Riffs, defined a riff as, "The main hook of a song and must be played principally by a guitar. It often begins the song, but is repeated throughout it, giving the song its distinctive voice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3CPpg0bvRvy4kVLtv49MyD6/radio-2-top-100-greatest-guitar-riffs-vote BBC Radio 2 website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''riff'' entered musical slang in the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;Rooksby (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; and is used primarily in discussion of forms of rock music or jazz. "Most rock musicians use ''riff'' as a near-synonym for ''musical idea.''"&lt;ref&gt;Middleton 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;125&lt;/ref&gt; The [[etymology]] of the term is not clearly known. Some sources explain ''riff'' as an abbreviation for ''rhythmic figure'' or ''refrain''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=riff "Riff"], ''Dictionary.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlie Parker]]'s 1945 recording "[[Anthropology (composition)|Thriving From a Riff]]" may have popularized the term.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Use of the term has extended to comedy, where ''riffing'' means the verbal exploration of a particular subject, thus moving the meaning away from the original jazz sense of a repeated figure that a soloist improvises over, to instead indicate the improvisation itself—improvising on a melody or progression as one would improvise on a subject by extending a singular thought, idea or inspiration into a ''bit'', or ''routine''.

===Use in jazz and R&amp;B===
In jazz and [[rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], riffs are often used as the starting point for longer compositions. The "[[Night Train (Jimmy Forrest composition)|Night Train]]" riff was first used in [[Duke Ellington]]'s "[[Deep South Suite|Happy-Go-Lucky Local]]", which Ellington recycled from [[Johnny Hodges]]' earlier "That's the Blues, Old Man".{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The riff from [[Charlie Parker]]'s [[bebop]] number "[[Charlie Parker's Savoy and Dial Sessions#Session 1|Now's the Time]]" (1945) re-emerged four years later as the R&amp;B dance hit "[[The Hucklebuck]]". The verse of "The Hucklebuck"—another riff—was "borrowed" from the Artie Matthews composition "[[Weary Blues]]". Glenn Miller's "[[In the Mood]]" had an earlier life as [[Wingy Manone]]'s "Tar Paper Stomp". All these songs use [[twelve bar blues]] riffs, and most of these riffs probably precede the examples given.&lt;ref&gt;Covach, John. ''Form in Rock Music: A Primer'', p.&amp;nbsp;71, in Stein, Deborah (2005). ''Engaging Music: Essays in Music Analysis''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-517010-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither of the terms 'riff' or '[[Lick (music)|lick]]' are used in [[European classical music|classical music]]. Instead, individual musical phrases used as the basis of classical music pieces are called ostinatos or simply phrases. Contemporary jazz writers also use riff- or lick-like ostinatos in [[modal jazz|modal]] music. [[Latin jazz]] often uses [[guajeo]]-based riffs.

===Riff driven===
The term 'riff driven' describes a piece of music that relies on a repeated instrumental riff as the basis of its most prominent ''[[melody]]'', ''[[cadence (music)|cadence]]'', or (in some cases) ''[[leitmotif]]''. Riff-driven songs are largely a product of jazz, [[blues]], and post-blues era music (rock and pop).&lt;ref name="RollingStoneIllustratedHistory"&gt;{{cite book| title = The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll| edition = 3 Sub| last = Rolling Stone| year = 1992| publisher = Random House| isbn = 978-0-679-73728-5| pages = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical goal of riff-driven songs is akin to the classical ''[[Basso continuo|continuo]]'' effect, but raised to much higher importance (in fact, the repeated riff is used to anchor the song in the ears of the listener). The riff/continuo is brought to the forefront of the musical piece and often is the primary melody that remains in the listener's ears. A ''[[call and response (music)|call and response]]'' often holds the song together, creating a "circular" rather than linear feel.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;{{cite book| title = Key Terms in Popular Music and Culture| edition = Paperback| last = Horner, Bruce (Editor), Swiss, Thomas (Editor)| year = 1999| publisher = Blackwell Publishing Limited| isbn = 978-0-631-21264-5| pages = 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In music, a ''vamp'' is a [[Repetition (music)|repeating]] [[musical figure]], [[Section (music)|section]],&lt;ref name="Marshall"&gt;Marshall, Wolf (2008). ''Stuff! Good Guitar Players Should Know'', p. 138. {{ISBN|1-4234-3008-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[accompaniment]] used in [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[musical theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Corozine |first=Vince |title=Arranging Music for the Real World: Classical and Commercial Aspects | page=124|year=2002 |publisher=Mel Bay |location=Pacific, MO |isbn=0-7866-4961-5 |oclc=50470629 |ref=Corozine2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vamps are also found in [[Rock music|rock]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[R&amp;B]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Country music|country]], and post-sixties jazz.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt; Vamps are usually harmonically sparse:&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt; A vamp may consist of a single chord or a sequence of chords played in a repeated rhythm. The term frequently appeared in the instruction 'Vamp till ready' on sheet music for popular songs in the 1930s and 1940s, indicating the accompanist should repeat the musical phrase until the vocalist was ready. Vamps are generally symmetrical, self-contained, and open to variation.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt; The equivalent in [[European classical music|classical music]] is an ostinato, in [[hip hop]] and [[electronic music]] is the [[Music loop|loop]] and in rock music is the [[riff]].&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;

The slang term ''vamp'' comes from the Middle English word ''vampe'' (sock), from Old French ''avanpie'', equivalent to Modern French ''avant-pied'', literally ''before-foot''.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;&lt;ref name=answers&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/vamp "Vamp: Definition, Synonyms and Much More"]. ''Answers.com''. Answers Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many vamp-oriented songwriters begin the creative process by attempting to evoke a mood or feeling while riffing freely on an instrument or scat singing. Many well known artists primarily build songs with a vamp/riff/ostinato based approach—including [[John Lee Hooker]] ("[[Boogie Chillen]]", "House Rent Boogie"), [[Bo Diddley]] ("[[Hey Bo Diddley]]", "[[Who Do You Love? (Bo Diddley song)|Who Do You Love?]]"), [[Jimmy Page]] ("[[Ramble On]]", "[[Bron Yr-Aur (song)|Bron Yr Aur]]"), [[Nine Inch Nails]] ("[[Closer (Nine Inch Nails song)|Closer]]"), and [[Beck]] ("[[Loser (Beck song)|Loser]]").

Classic examples of vamps in jazz include "[[A Night in Tunisia]]", "[[Take Five]]", "[[A Love Supreme]]", "[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]", and "[[Cantaloupe Island]]".&lt;ref name="Rawlins" /&gt; Rock examples include the long jam at the ends of "[[Broken Arrow (album)|Loose Change]]" by [[Neil Young and Crazy Horse]] and "[[Ogre Tones|Sooner or Later]]" by [[King's X]].

===Jazz, fusion, and Latin jazz===
In [[jazz]], [[Jazz fusion|fusion]], and related genres, a background vamp provides a performer with a harmonic framework supporting improvisation. In [[Latin jazz]] [[guajeo]]s fulfill the role of piano vamp. A vamp at the beginning of a jazz tune may act as a springboard to the main tune; a vamp at the end of a song is often called a ''tag''.

====Examples====
"[[Take Five]]" begins with a repeated, syncopated figure in {{music|time|5|4}} time, which pianist [[Dave Brubeck]] plays throughout the song (except for [[Joe Morello]]'s drum solo and a variation on the chords in the middle section).

The music from [[Miles Davis]]'s modal period ({{circa}}1958–1963) was based on improvising songs with a small number of chords. The jazz standard "[[So What (instrumental)|So What]]" uses a vamp in the two-note "Sooooo what?" figure, regularly played by the piano and the trumpet throughout. Jazz scholar Barry Kernfeld calls this music ''vamp music''.{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Examples include the outros to [[George Benson]]'s "[[Body Talk (Robyn album)|Body Talk]]" and "Plum", and the solo changes to "[[Breezin']]".&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt; The following songs are dominated by vamps: [[John Coltrane]], [[Kenny Burrell]], and [[Grant Green]]'s versions of "[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]", [[Herbie Hancock]]'s "[[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]" and "[[Chameleon (composition)|Chameleon]]", [[Wes Montgomery]]'s "[[Tequila (Wes Montgomery album)|Bumpin' on Sunset]]", and [[Larry Carlton]]'s "[[Room 335]]".&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;

The Afro-Cuban vamp style known as [[guajeo]] is used in the [[bebop]]/[[Latin jazz]] standard "[[A Night in Tunisia]]". Depending upon the musician, a repeating figure in "A Night in Tunisia" could be called an ''ostinato'', ''guajeo'', ''riff'', or ''vamp''. The Cuban-jazz hybrid spans the disciplines that encompass all these terms.

===Gospel, soul, and funk===
In [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[soul music]], the band often vamps on a simple ostinato [[Groove (music)|groove]] at the end of a song, usually over a single chord. In soul music, the end of recorded songs often contains a display of vocal effects—such as rapid scales, arpeggios, and improvised [[section (music)|passages]]. For recordings, sound engineers gradually fade out the vamp section at the end of a song, to transition to the next track on the album. [[Salsoul]] singers such as [[Loleatta Holloway]] have become notable for their vocal improvisations at the end of songs, and they are sampled and used in other songs. [[Andrae Crouch]] extended the use of vamps in gospel, introducing chain vamps (one vamp after the other, each successive vamp drawn from the first).&lt;ref name="California"&gt;Jacqueline Cogdell DjeDje, Eddie S. Meadows (1998). ''California Soul'', p. 224. {{ISBN|0-520-20628-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

1970s-era [[funk]] music often takes a short one or two bar musical figure based on a single chord one would consider an introduction vamp in jazz or soul music, and then uses this vamp as the basis of the entire song ("[[Funky Drummer]]" by [[James Brown]], for example). Jazz, blues, and rock are almost always based on chord progressions (a sequence of changing chords), and they use the changing harmony to build tension and sustain listener interest. Unlike these music genres, funk is based on the rhythmic groove of the percussion, rhythm section instruments, and a deep electric bass line, usually all over a single chord. "In funk, harmony is often second to the 'lock,' the linking of contrapuntal parts that are played on guitar, bass, and drums in the repeating vamp."&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt;

Examples include [[Stevie Wonder]]'s vamp-based "[[Superstition (song)|Superstition]]"&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt; and [[Little Johnny Taylor]]'s "[[Part Time Love]]", which features an extended improvisation over a two-chord vamp.&lt;ref name="California" /&gt;

===Musical theater===
In [[musical theater]], a vamp, or intro, is the few [[Bar (music)|bars]], one to eight, of music without lyrics that begin a printed copy of a song.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig, David (1990). ''On Singing Onstage'', p. 22. {{ISBN|1-55783-043-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The orchestra may repeat the vamp or other accompaniment during dialogue or stage business, as accompaniment for onstage transitions of indeterminate length. The score provides a one or two bar vamp figure, and indicates, "Vamp till cue", by the conductor. The vamp gives the onstage singers time to prepare for the song or the next verse, without requiring the music to pause. Once the vamp section is over, the music continues to the next section.

The vamp may be written by the composer of the song, a copyist employed by the publisher, or the arranger for the vocalist.&lt;ref name="Craig" /&gt; The vamp serves three main purposes: it provides the key, establishes the tempo, and provides emotional context.&lt;ref name="Craig 23"&gt;Craig (1990), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The vamp may be as short as a ''bell tone'', ''sting'' (a harmonized bell tone with stress on the starting note), or measures long.&lt;ref name="Craig 23" /&gt; The ''rideout'' is the transitional music that begins on the downbeat of the last word of the song and is usually two to four bars long, though it may be as short as a sting or as long as a Roxy Rideout.&lt;ref name="Craig 26"&gt;Craig (1990), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian classical music===
&lt;!-- [[Lehara]] redirects here. --&gt;
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}

In [[Indian classical music]], during [[Tabla]] or [[Pakhawaj]] solo performances and [[Kathak]] dance accompaniments, a conceptually similar melodic pattern known as the '''Lehara''' (sometimes spelled Lehra)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakshi|first1=Haresh|title=101 Raga-s for the 21st Century and Beyond: A Music Lover's Guide|isbn=1412231353|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=DQdWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT59&amp;lpg=PT59&amp;dq=lehra+meaning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9d1AKCDAEy&amp;sig=RXX4LuKKfondzDaKSjPtdj-x1SU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBmoVChMIooPnk9X1yAIVITamCh035Qsd#v=onepage&amp;q=lehra%20meaning&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Nagma is played repeatedly throughout the performance. This melodic pattern is set to the number of beats in a rhythmic cycle ([[Tala (music)|Tala]] or Taal) being performed and may be based on one or a blend of multiple [[Raga]]s.

The basic idea of the lehara is to provide a steady melodious framework and keep the time-cycle for rhythmic improvisations. It serves as an auditory workbench not only for the soloist but also for the audience to appreciate the ingenuity of the improvisations and thus the merits of the overall performance. In Indian Classical Music, the concept of 'sam' (pronounced as 'sum') carries paramount importance. The sam is the target unison beat (and almost always the first beat) of any rhythmic cycle. The second most important beat is the Khali, which is a complement of the sam. Besides these two prominent beats, there are other beats of emphasis in any given taal, which signify 'khand's (divisions) of the taal. E.g. 'Roopak' or 'Rupak' taal, a 7-beat rhythmic cycle, is divided 3–2–2, further implying that the 1st, 4th, and 6th beats are the prominent beats in that taal. Therefore, it is customary, but not essential, to align the lehara according to the divisions of the Taal. It is done with a view to emphasize those beats that mark the divisions of the Taal.

The lehara can be played on a variety of instruments, including the [[sarangi]], [[harmonium]], [[sitar]], [[sarod]], [[flute]] and others. The playing of the lehara is relatively free from the numerous rules and constraints of ''Raga Sangeet'', which are upheld and honoured in the tradition of Indian Classical Music. The lehara may be interspersed with short and occasional improvisations built around the basic melody. It is also permissible to switch between two or more disparate melodies during the course of the performance. It is essential that the lehara be played with the highest precision in [[tempo|Laya]] (Tempo) and [[Swara]] control, which requires years of specialist training (''Taalim'') and practice (''Riyaaz''). It is considered a hallmark of excellence to play lehara alongside a recognised Tabla or Pakhawaj virtuoso as it is a difficult task to keep a steady pulse while the percussionist is improvising or playing difficult compositions in counterpoint. While there may be scores of individually talented instrumentalists, there are very few who are capable of playing the lehra for a Tabla / Pakhawaj solo performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1769">{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}'''Pacific reggae''' is a style of [[reggae]] music found in the [[Pacific]].  This style is found in [[Polynesia]] (including [[New Zealand]] and [[Hawaii]]), and [[Melanesia]] (including [[Papua New Guinea]]).  Within this genre there are differing styles, for example between the [[New Zealand reggae]] sound (such as [[Katchafire]]), and that found in the [[Pacific Islands]]. According to [[Herbs (band)|Herbs]] co-founder Dilworth Karaka, it is a phrase [[UB40]] came up with.&lt;ref name="5 songs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10544327|title=Politics, peace and love (stories behind 5 songs as told by Karaka)|last=Kara|first=Scott|date=Nov 22, 2008|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacific reggae differs from [[Jamaican reggae]] in the use of instruments such as the [[ukulele]], traditional wooden drums, and keyboard synthesizers.  Reggae in the Pacific is not typically [[Rastafarian]]; in the [[Pacific Islands]], songs are often remakes of traditional songs e.g. Small Axe's remake of ''Kalipolina''.  New Zealand reggae has [[Māori people|Māori]] influences.

Notable Pacific reggae groups include [[Herbs (band)|Herbs]], who originally played a more Jamaican reggae style.  They were subsequently encouraged by [[Bob Marley]] when he toured New Zealand in 1979, to explore and develop the Pacific reggae sound.

Other notable Reggae groups include [[Three Houses Down]], [[BrownHill]], [[Kolohe Kai]], [[Rebel Souljahz]] and artists such as [[Fiji Veikoso]], [[Swiss]] and [[Majic]]

The '''Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh''' was a now defunct learned society which was based in Edinburgh, Scotland "for the cultivation of the physical sciences".&lt;ref name = RPS&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/~rsgs/ifa/hdms/rpse/provlist.htm|title= Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh|publisher=Images for All|accessdate= 8 November 2015}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The society was founded in 1771 as the '''Physico-Chirurgical Society''' but soon after changed its name to the '''Physical Society'''. After being granted a Royal Charter in 1778 it became the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh. &lt;ref name=RPSE&gt; {{cite web|url= http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1771rpse.html|title= Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh|publisher= Scholarly Societies Project|accessdate= 8 November 2015|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150717122346/http://www.scholarly-societies.org/history/1771rpse.html|archivedate= 17 July 2015|df= dmy-all}} &lt;/ref&gt;

It absorbed a number of other societies over the next fifty years, including the '''Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society''' in 1782 (not to be confused with the modern [[Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh]], founded in 1821), the '''American Physical Society''' in 1796 (not to be confused with the modern [[American Physical Society]], founded in 1899), the '''Hibernian Medical Society''' in 1799, the '''Chemical Society''' in 1803, the '''Natural History Society''' in 1812 and the '''Didactic Society''' in 1813.&lt;ref name= RPSE/&gt;

The society occupied a lecture hall in Nicholson Street, Edinburgh complete with library. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book| title=Encyclopaedia perthensis, or, Universal dictionary of the arts ..., Volume 21|page = 124}} &lt;/ref&gt; It published a regular journal, ''Proceedings of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh'', between 1854 and 1965 devoted to articles on experimental biology and natural history.&lt;ref name= RPS/&gt;

Members of the society were known as Fellows and permitted to use the postnomial FRPSE. Presidents were elected at intervals, sometimes more than one for each year.

Some of the records of the Society (1828-1884) are now managed by the [[Royal Scottish Geographical Society]].

'''''Räsypokka''''' was a [[game show]] broadcast on the [[SubTV]] network in [[Finland]] from 2001 to 2003.  The show was hosted by [[Jaajo Linnonmaa]]. The title (literally "threads poker") stands for [[strip poker]] and sums up the content of the show, which often featured full-frontal nudity.  Two males and two females competed on each episode. Several episodes were filmed live at bars and dance clubs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3115">'''Stag party tourism''' is [[tourism]] for the purpose of being a participant of a [[stag party]], also called a bachelor party, usually held in another country. Destination stag parties are especially popular with [[British people|Briton]]s, with [[Eastern Europe]] often being the preferred destination.&lt;ref name="boyer"&gt;Boyer, David.

==Popular destinations==
[[File:Wieczor-kawalerskie-partybus1-300x225.jpg|thumb|Stag party in PartyBus Krakow]]
*'''Central Europe and the Baltics''' – [[Central Europe]] is becoming increasingly popular due to the cheap prices and variety of stag activities on offer with destinations such as [[Budapest]], [[Prague]], [[Riga]] and [[Krakow]] rising in popularity. There are a number of companies now specialising in trips to venues such as Prague and Krakow as stags look to head to Central Europe.  In Krakow alone 9 million visitors came in 2012, with a number of these being stag or hen parties. It is Prague however which was listed in a [[BBC]] 3 documentary as the most popular stag do destination.
*'''Amsterdam''' – [[Amsterdam]] is popular due to its short flight times from the [[UK]] and also the relaxed laws regarding [[marijuana]].  Amsterdam’s [[De Wallen]] district is also a popular destination for stag parties, with the [[Daily Mail]] listing Amsterdam as the third most popular destination for stag parties.
*'''UK''' – Many people also opt to have their [[stag party]] in the UK. There are a number of activities available all over the UK, with a number of different companies offering packages including all aspects of the stag weekend in this destination.
*'''Spain''' – If people want nice weather then they head to [[Spain]] with many people citing the good weather as a reason to visit. Spain is also seen as the most popular hen party destination, with the Daily Mail listing it as the number one destination for hens.

==Negative Impacts==
Despite bringing in a lot of money to the economies of the stag party destinations, there are also a number of people who say that it has a negative impact. In November 2014 the Archbishop of Krakow released a statement urging the people in the city to join him in a month of prayer to help the city’s “spiritual renewal” and that it had been “defaced by debauchery and drunkenness”

'''''The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer''''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|f|aɪ|f|ər}} {{respell|pə|FY|fər}}) is an American [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] that aired on [[UPN]] in 1998. Before it was even debuted, the series set off a storm of controversy because of a perceived light-hearted take on the issue of [[American slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/09/30/1998-09-30_a_racial_tv_battle_blacks_ri.html|title=A Racial TV Battle: Blacks Rip Sitcom About Lincoln Butler That Find Humor in Slavery|last=Millner|first=Denene|date=1998-09-20|publisher=nydailynews.com|accessdate=2009-05-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930101634/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1998/09/30/1998-09-30_a_racial_tv_battle_blacks_ri.html|archivedate=2009-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
A black English nobleman named Desmond Pfeiffer, chased out of England due to gambling debts, becomes President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s valet. In the show, he serves as the intelligent and erudite backbone of a [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-era [[White House]] populated by louts and [[drunkard]]s.

==Cast==
* [[Chi McBride]] as Desmond Pfeiffer, Black English gentleman serving as President Lincoln's butler
* [[Dann Florek]] as [[Abraham Lincoln]], 16th President of the United States
* [[Christine Estabrook]] as [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], President Lincoln's wife
* Max Baker as Nibblet, Pfeiffer's assistant
* Kelly Connell as [[Ulysses S. Grant]], General of the United States Army

==Controversy==
Before the series' premiere, several African American activist groups, including the Los Angeles area [[NAACP]], protested against the premise of the series. On September 24, 1998, a protest against the series was held outside [[Paramount Studios]]. Five days later, [[UPN]] released a statement regarding the controversy and stated that the network planned on delaying the controversial pilot episode (which never aired) and would instead air an alternate episode in its place. The first episode of the series aired on October 5, 1998, ranking 116th out of 125 television programs for that week. ''Desmond Pfeiffer'' was removed from UPN's schedule on October 24 and, after airing one episode two days after being removed from UPN's lineup, was canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvobscurities.com/category/q-and-a/|title=Q &amp; A: The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer, Whodunnit?|date=2009-05-20|publisher=tvobscurities.com|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

In 2002, ''[[TV Guide]]'' listed the show as the eleventh-worst TV series ever,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TV Guide Book of Lists|year=2007|publisher=Running Press|isbn=0-7624-3007-9|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 [[TV Guide Network]] listed the show at #15 on their list of ''25 Biggest TV Blunders''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20100302tvguide01|title=Breaking News - TV Guide Network's "25 Biggest TV Blunders" Special Delivers 3.3 Million Viewers|date=2010-03-02|publisher=thefutoncritic.com|accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Film Threat]]'s Phil Hall gave the show a positive review, writing, "Today, the show is remembered (barely) as a bizarre flop – but after watching a pair of episodes that are currently available for YouTube viewing, I would be bold enough to declare that "The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer" deserves a new consideration. ... If you have the patience for crass, innuendo-laced, no-taste bawdy comedy, you will certainly find yourself laughing out loud over this series."&lt;ref name=filmthreat/&gt;

The series was alluded to multiple times in the unaired pilot episode of ''[[Clerks: The Animated Series]]'', "Leonardo Leonardo Returns and Dante Has an Important Decision to Make", which featured Dante and Randal drawing inspiration from a non-existent episode of ''The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'', which Randal describes as "classic Pfeiffer".&lt;ref name=filmthreat&gt;http://www.filmthreat.com/features/58140/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tijuana Cultural Center''' ('''CECUT''') is a [[cultural center]] in the [[Zona Río, Tijuana|Zona Río]] district of [[Tijuana]], [[Mexico]]. The center opened 20 October 1982, and accommodates more than a million visitors per year.

A major feature of the complex is an [[OMNIMAX]] cinema designed by architects Pedro Ramirez Vazques and Manuel Rossen Morrison. It is the only [[IMAX]] cinema in Tijuana, and has come to be popularly known as ''La Bola'' ("The Ball"). The cinema, which uses a 360-degree projector to surround viewers with a panoramic image, has 308 seats.

The OMNIMAX cinema has been part of the cultural center since the complex first opened in 1982. In October of that year, it premiered the film ''El pueblo del sol'', which was made especially for the cinema's opening. The film presents images from the most representative regions of Mexico, and got very good reviews. It was the cinema's only film for 13 years. Today, the center offers a daily selection of films; it premieres about four films per year.

[[File:Cecut.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The OMNIMAX cinema]]
The center encompasses a large esplanade that accommodates up to 6,000 people. The esplanade is a venue for performances, festivals, and expos.

There is also permanent exhibition, called "Museo de las Californias", which stores over 200 pieces and is a walk through the history of the Baja Peninsula and the state of California from the prehistoric period until the first half of the 20th century. Also a pre-Hispanic garden, called "Jardin Caracol (Snail Garden)", that contains sculptures from the different regions of the [[mesoamerican]] cultures that inhabited south Mexico before the arrival of the Spanish Army. Visitors can have the experience of going through the exhibition while enjoying a coffee since there is a little coffee shop in the garden.

There is also a scenic theatre which has a room for around a thousand visitors and it is mostly used for private concerts and plays. There are also lecture rooms, video room, café, and a bookshop. There are several spaces for temporary small exhibits.

In September 2008, on the eve of its 26th anniversary, CECUT opened its doors to a brand new building called "El Cubo" (The Cube),  so named because of the contrast between the nickname of the OMNIMAX cinema "The Ball". This represented the very important opportunity for CECUT to start receiving International Exhibitions, and since then it has been the home for exhibitions that have traveled from other countries including Buda Guanyin, Gabriel Figueroa, Alice Rahon, Venus en Tijuana, Proyecto Civico, and Animated Painting among others.

Nowadays this important institution has different programs for all ages, since classes for early stimulation for kids around 2 months and 2 years, plastic arts and artisan workshops for children from 5 to 15 years and concerts, conferences, movies, documentaries, exhibitions, and all kind of services for the whole family to enjoy the day and spend a nice time learning.

CECUT is a short distance from the [[Mexico–United States border]] at [[San Ysidro, San Diego]].

A '''toga party''' is a Greek or Roman themed [[costume party]] where attendees wear a [[toga]] (normally made from a [[bed sheet]]) with [[sandal]]s. The costumes, party games, and other entertainment often adhere to the Roman or Greek theme. Toga parties are associated with [[keg party|keg parties]] and [[binge drinking|excessive drinking]], and attendees typically tend to be college or university students.

==History==
The earliest known college "toga parties" took place in the early 1950s.  Toga parties are recorded in the yearbooks for [[Theta Delta Chi]] (1952)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Shield |publisher=[[Theta Delta Chi]] |date=1952 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-AHPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22toga+party%22&amp;dq=%22toga+party%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the University of Michigan's [[Acacia (fraternity)|Acacia fraternity]] (1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Triad |publisher=[[Acacia (fraternity)|Acacia]] |date=1953 |page=96 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=McbmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22toga+party%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early toga party took place in 1953, when [[Pomona College]] students wore togas and ivy wreaths, and brought their dorm mattresses to freshman Mark Neuman's home on Hillcrest Avenue in nearby Flintridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What to Wear to a Toga Party |url=http://www.innovateus.net/innopedia/what-wear-toga-party |publisher=Innovate US |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the eight decades before Greek-themed parties became known as "toga parties" in the 1950s, similar parties were generally called "bed sheet and pillow slip" parties (or simply, "pillow slip" parties), in which attendees wrapped themselves in sheets and pillow cases, were regularly held by fraternal orders (like the Masons, Odd Fellows and Elks), civic organizations, and church groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jensen Brown|first1=Peter|title=Fraternal Orders, Fraternities, Bed Sheets and Pillow Cases - Wrapping Up the History of the "Toga Party"|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2016/12/fraternal-orders-fraternities-bed.html|website=Early Sports 'n' Pop-Culture History Blog|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1882, the Terpsichore Society of the Ohio State University held a "pillow slip party" which may arguably be considered the first-ever college "toga party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Makio|date=1886|publisher=Fraternities of the Ohio State University|location=Columbus, Ohio|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Guinness World Record]] for the largest toga party is 3,700 participants. The event, organized by the [[University of Queensland Union]] and the [[Queensland University of Technology]] Student Guild, was held on 24 February 2012 at [[Riverstage]] in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-toga-party/ Guinness World Records: Largest Toga Party]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[File:GreekTogaPartyGreekFestNOLA2009.JPG|thumb|Attendees in various colored togas]]
Toga parties were depicted in the 1978 film ''[[Animal House]]'', which propelled the ritual into a widespread and enduring practice. [[Chris Miller (writer)|Chris Miller]], who was one of the writers of ''Animal House'', attended [[Dartmouth College]] where the toga party was a popular costume event at major fraternity parties (such as [[Dartmouth College traditions|Winter Carnival]] and [[Dartmouth College traditions|Green Key Weekend]]) during the late 1950s and early 1960s.

First lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] held a toga party to spoof those that compared her husband President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to "Caesar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDR Birthday|url=https://fdrlibrary.org/fdr-birthday|website=FDR Presidential Library and Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mount, Harry.

A toga party was also briefly described in [[Tom Wolfe]]'s 1968 story "[[The Pump House Gang]]", although somewhat different from the version in the film. Toga parties are also seen in the first episode of season four of the television series ''[[Greek (TV series)|Greek]]'' and in the fourth episode of ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]''.

'''''Up from Paradise''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a novel and lyrics by [[Arthur Miller]] and music by [[Stanley Silverman]].

In 1972, Miller's comedy ''[[The Creation of the World and Other Business]]'' closed after only twenty performances. Undaunted by its failure, he revamped it as a musical, a retelling of [[God]]'s battle with [[Lucifer]] for control of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] and [[Eve]] as chronicled in the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gussow|first1=Mel|title=Arthur Miller Returns to Genesis for First Musical|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/12/specials/miller-genesis.html|accessdate=6 January 2017|publisher=The New York Times|date=April 17, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Up from Paradise'' was staged at Miller's [[alma mater]], the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]], in 1974.&lt;ref name= NYT/&gt; It was presented in [[concert]] form in the Composers' Showcase at the [[Whitney Museum]] in [[Manhattan]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Peter G.|title=Anniversary Faults|journal=New York Magazine|date=October 19, 1981|volume=14|issue=41|page=89-91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GOYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;dq=Composers%27+Showcase+Whitney+%22up+from+paradise%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fully staged [[off-Broadway]] production, directed by Ran Avni, opened on October 25, 1983 at the Jewish Repertory Theater. The cast included [[Len Cariou]] as God, [[Austin Pendleton]] as Adam, [[Alice Playten]] as Eve, [[Walter Bobbie]] as Lucifer, and [[Lonny Price]] as [[Cain and Abel|Abel]].

The London premiere was staged at the [[New Wimbledon Theatre]] by PK Productions in July 2014.
