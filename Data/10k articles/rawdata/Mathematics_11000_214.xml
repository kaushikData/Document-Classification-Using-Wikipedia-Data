      <comment>I changed the definition. It now states that (1)⇔(2)⇔(3). This is a stronger statement that what was previously given. (2) and (3) consequently belong into the definition. A side effect is that no preference is given to any of the 3 conditions, as should be the case since they are equivalent.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4192">In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[multilinear algebra]], an '''alternating multilinear map''' is a [[multilinear map]] with all arguments belonging to the same space (e.g., a [[bilinear form]] or a [[multilinear form]]) that is zero whenever any two adjacent arguments are equal.

The notion of '''alternatization''' (or '''alternatisation''' in [[British English]]) is used to derive an alternating multilinear map from any multilinear map with all arguments belonging to the same space.

== Definition ==

A multilinear map of the form &lt;math&gt;f\colon V^n \to W&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''alternating''' if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions:
# if there exists &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1 \leq i \leq n-1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i = x_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lang-2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|2002|pages=511–512}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|2007|p=A III.80, §4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# if there exists &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1 \leq i \neq j \leq n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_i = x_j&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Lang-2002"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dummit-Foote-2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Dummit|Foote|2004|p=436}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# if &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; are [[linearly dependent]] then &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

== Example ==

* In a [[Lie algebra]], the [[Lie algebra|Lie bracket]] is an alternating bilinear map.

* The [[determinant]] of a matrix is a multilinear alternating map of the rows or columns of the matrix.

== Properties ==

* If any component ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' of an alternating multilinear map is replaced by {{nowrap|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''c x&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} for any {{nowrap|''j'' ≠ ''i''}} and ''c'' in the base ring ''R'', then the value of that map is not changed.&lt;ref name="Dummit-Foote-2004"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every alternating multilinear map is antisymmetric.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rotman|1995|p=235}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* If ''n''! is a [[Unit (ring theory)|unit]] in the base ring ''R'', then every antisymmetric ''n''-multilinear form is alternating.

== Alternatization ==

Given a multilinear map of the form &lt;math&gt;f\colon V^n \to W&lt;/math&gt;, the alternating multilinear map &lt;math&gt;g\colon V^n \to W&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;g(x_1, \ldots, x_n) := \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sgn(\sigma)f(x_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, x_{\sigma(n)})&lt;/math&gt; is said to be the '''alternatization''' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

; Properties

* The alternatization of an ''n''-multilinear alternating map is ''n''! times itself.
* The alternatization of a [[symmetric map]] is zero.
* The alternatization of a [[bilinear map]] is bilinear. Most notably, the alternatization of any [[Chain complex|cocycle]] is bilinear. This fact plays a crucial role in identifying the second [[Cohomology|cohomology group]] of a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] with the group of alternating [[bilinear form]]s on a lattice.

'''Anamorphosis''' is a distorted projection or perspective requiring the viewer to use special devices or occupy a specific vantage point (or both) to view a recognizable image. Some of the media it is used in are painting, photography, sculpture and installation, toys, and film special effects.  The word "anamorphosis" is derived from the Greek prefix ''ana&amp;#8209;'', meaning "back" or "again", and the word ''morphe'', meaning "shape" or "form". An optical anamorphism is the visualization of a mathematical operation called an [[affine transformation]].&lt;ref name="Sánchez-Reyes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sánchez-Reyes|first1=Javier|last2=Chacón|first2=Jesús M.|title=Anamorphic Free-Form Deformation|journal=Computer Aided Geometric Design|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167839616300826 |accessdate=February 23, 2017 |pages=30–42|doi=10.1016/j.cagd.2016.06.002|date=August 1, 2016|volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of extreme anamorphosis has been used by artists to disguise [[caricature]]s, [[erotic]] and [[scatological]] scenes, and other furtive images from a casual viewer, while revealing an undistorted image to the knowledgeable spectator.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Daniel L. |title=Anamorphosis and the Eccentric Observer: History, Technique and Current Practice |journal=Leonardo |date=1992 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=179 |doi=10.2307/1575710|jstor=1575710 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of projection==
[[File:Anamorphosis chair.jpg|thumb|300px|Example of mirror anamorphosis]]

There are two main types of anamorphosis: ''perspective'' (oblique) and ''mirror'' (catoptric). More-complex anamorphoses can be devised using distorted lenses, mirrors, or other optical transformations.

Examples of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspectival]] anamorphosis date to the early [[Renaissance]] (fifteenth century).&lt;ref name="Baltrušaitis 1977" /&gt; Examples of mirror anamorphosis were first seen in the late Renaissance (sixteenth century).

With mirror anamorphosis, a conical or cylindrical [[mirror]] is placed on the drawing or painting to transform a flat distorted image into an apparently undistorted picture that can be viewed from many angles. The deformed image is painted on a plane surface surrounding the mirror. By looking into the mirror, a viewer can see the image undeformed.

With ''Channel anamorphosis'' or ''[[turning picture]]s'' two different images are on different sides of a corrugated carrier. A straight frontal view shows an unclear mix of the images, while each image can be viewed correctly from a certain angle.

==History==
===Early Use of Distorted Perspective===
The prehistoric cave paintings at [[Lascaux]] may make use of anamorphic technique, because the oblique angles of the cave would otherwise result in distorted figures from a viewer's perspective.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The ancient historians [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Tzetzes]] both record a sculpture competition between [[Alcamenes]] and [[Phidias]] to create an image of [[Minerva]]. Alcamenes' sculpture was beautiful, while Phidias' had grotesque proportions. Yet once both had been mounted on pillars, the decelerated perspective made Phidias' Minerva beautiful and Alcamenes' ugly.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=7-8}}

===Renaissance===
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Holbein's ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' with a ''[[memento mori]]'' anamorph skull in the foreground, 1533 ]]

[[File:Holbein Skull.jpg|thumb|Viewed from the correct oblique angle, the diagonal in ''The Ambassadors'' transforms into an undistorted ''memento mori''.]]

During the Renaissance, artists' experimentation with optics and perspective lead to more advanced development of anamorphic imagery. At this time, religious thought and science were equally important to the technique's growth in Europe. {{r|Baltrušaitis 1977| p=70}} The earliest known example, known as ''Leonardo's Eye'', was executed by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and is included in the ''[[Codex Atlanticus]]'' (1483-1518). He later completed several large-scale anamorphic commissions for the King of France. [[Vignolo]] credited [[Tommasso Lauretti]] as the originator of a perspectival anamorphic technique in one of the earliest written descriptions in ''Two Rules'', compiled between 1530 and 1540 but not published until 1583. Without access to Vignolo's work, many other descriptions and examples were created before 1583.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977| p=29-30,32-33}}

''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' (c. 1533) by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] is well known for the prominent oblique anamorphic transformation in the painting. In this artwork, a distorted shape lies diagonally across the bottom of the frame. Viewing this from an acute angle transforms it into the plastic image of a [[human skull]]. The painting is regarded as a ''[[vanitas]]'' - a meditation on the transience of life - with the skull a symbolic ''[[memento mori]]''. The altered perspective required to see the image reflects the contemporary practice of painting skulls on the reverse of otherwise tranquil paintings.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|chapter=7 Holbein's 'The Ambassadors'}} Four centuries later, the painting inspired the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Jaques Lacan]] to note in ‘Of the Gaze as ''Objet Petit a''’ (1973) that the use of anamorphism, particularly in this painting, is one of the few methods for making viewers aware of their gaze.&lt;ref name="Scott DS Project"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Maria |title=Deciphering the Gaze in Lacan's 'Of the Gaze as Objet Petit {{!}} The DS Project |url=http://thedsproject.com/portfolio/deciphering-the-gaze-in-lacans-of-the-gaze-as-objet-petit-a/ |website=The DS Project |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 17th century, a revival of fantastical anamorphic imagery occurred.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=26-28}} Mirror anamorphosis emerged at this time in Italy and China. It remains uncertain whether Jesuit missionaries imported or exported the technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication |jstor= 3049875|title= Review: Anamorphic Act by Jurgis Baltrušaitis |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two major works on perspective were published: ''Perspective''(1612) by [[Salomon de Caus]], and ''Curious Perspective'' (1638) by [[Jean-Francois Niceron]]. Each contained extensive  scientific and practical infromation on anamorphic imagery. In Niceron's work, three types of large-scale anamorphism are explained: 'optical' (looking horizontally); 'anoptric' (looking upwards); and 'catoptric' (looking down ie. from a mezzanine).

[[Baroque]] ''[[trompe l'oeil]]'' murals often used anamorphism to combine actual architectural elements with illusory painted elements to create a seamless effect when viewed  from a specific location. The dome and vault of the [[Sant'Ignazio|Church of St. Ignazio]] in Rome, painted by [[Andrea Pozzo]], represented the pinnacle of illusion. Due to neighboring monks complaining about blocked light, Pozzo was commissioned to paint the ceiling to look like the inside of a dome, instead of building a real dome. As the ceiling is flat, there is only one spot where the illusion is perfect and a dome looks undistorted.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Anamorphosis could be used to conceal images for privacy or personal safety, and many secret portraits were created of deposed royalty. A well-known anamorphic portrait of the English [[King Edward VI]] was completed a year before his execution in 1546, only visible when viewed through a hole in the frame. It was later hung at [[Whitehall Palace]], and may have influenced [[Shakespeare]] during the writing of ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=16-18}} Many anamorphic portraits of [[King Charles I]] were created and shared following his 1649 execution.{{r|Baltrušaitis 1977|p=28}}  A secret mirror anamorphosis portrait of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]] can only be recognized when a polished cylinder is placed in the correct position. To possess such an image would have been seen as [[treason]] in the aftermath of the 1746 [[Battle of Culloden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westhighlandmuseum.org.uk/collections/the-jacobites/secret-portrait/ |title=Now you see me  |publisher=[[West Highland Museum]] |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth Century===
[[File:Thomas-Mole-Living Emblem-1919-USMC.jpg|thumb|Thomas and Mole, ''Living Emblem'' (1919). USMC]]
In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, anamorphic images had come to be used more as [[children's games]] than fine art.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; By the twentieth century, some artists wanted to renew the technique of anamorphosis for aesthetic and conceptual effect. During the First World War [[Arthur Mole]], an American commercial photographer, used anamorphic techniques to create patriotic images from massive assembled groups of soldiers and reservists. When seen from high above, the gathered people resolved into recognizable pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Radio |first1=Minnesota Public |title=MPR: Group setting |url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/01/28_robertsc_grouppix/ |accessdate=30 November 2018 |work=news.minnesota.publicradio.org |date=28 January 2005 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcel Duchamp]] was interested in anamorphosis. His last work ''[[Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas]]'' (1946-66) used mild anamorphosis to force viewers into the position of peep-hole voyeurs in order to see a nude, anonymous human body.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

[[Surrealist]] artist [[Salvador Dalí]] used extreme [[foreshortening]] and anamorphism in his paintings and works, and had a [[glass floor]] installed in a room next to his studio to enable radical perspective studies from above and below.&lt;ref name=GlassFloor&gt;{{cite book|last=Ades|first=ed. by Dawn|title=Dalí's optical illusions : [Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, January 21 - March 26, 2000 : Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, April 19 - June 18, 2000 ; Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, July 25 - October 1, 2000]|year=2000|publisher=Yale Univ.

==Impossible objects==
[[File:Necker cube.svg|thumb|Necker cube]]
In the twentieth century, artists began to play with perspective by drawing "impossible objects". These objects included stairs that always ascend, or cubes where the back meets the front. Such works were popularized by the artist [[M. C. Escher]] and the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]]. Although referred to as "impossible objects", such objects as the [[Necker Cube]] and the [[Penrose triangle]] can be sculpted in 3-D by using anamorphic illusion. When viewed at a certain angle, such sculptures appear as the so-called impossible objects.

==Ames Rooms==
[[File:Ames room forced perspective.jpg|thumb|Ames room forced perspective]]
[[File:Ames room.JPG|thumb|Ames room]]
The [[Ames room]] was invented by American scientist [[Adelbert Ames]], Jr. in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.psychologie.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/html/ames_room.html |title=Ames Room |first= |last= |work=psychologie.tu-dresden.de |year=2001  |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When viewed through a peephole, the room appears to have normal perspective. However, all other viewpoints reveal that the room is constructed of irregular trapezoids. Similar effects had been achieved during the Renaissance through the use of "accelerated perspective" in stage design. These included productions by Scamozzi (1588-9), Furtenbach (1625), Sabbattini (1637) and Troili (1672).&lt;ref name="Baltrušaitis 1977"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baltrušaitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York |isbn=9780810906624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most interesting effects of an Ames room is that the distorted perspective can make people and objects looks much bigger or smaller than they really are.&lt;ref name="EB Anamorphosis"&gt;{{cite web |title=Anamorphosis art |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/anamorphosis-art |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=18 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Ames rooms are widely used in cinema for [[practical special effects]]. A well-known example is the homes in the Shire from the [[Lord of The Rings (film franchise)|Lord of the Rings]] and [[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]] films. Through the use of [[forced perspective]], the character of Gandalf appeared much larger than the characters of Frodo and Bilbo, without the use of digital effects.&lt;ref name="Cosmos"&gt;{{cite web |last1=England |first1=Jason |title=Hobbit houses and the Moon trick the brain and eye {{!}} Cosmos |url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/physics/hobbit-houses-and-moon-trick-brain-and-eye |website=cosmosmagazine.com |accessdate=20 November 2018 |language=en |date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical uses==
[[Cinemascope]], [[Panavision]], [[Technirama]], and other [[widescreen]] formats use anamorphosis to project a wider image from a narrower film frame. The [[IMAX]] company uses even more extreme anamorphic transformations to project moving images from a flat film frame onto the inside of a [[sphere|hemispheric]] dome, in its "Omnimax" or "IMAX Dome" process.
 
The technique of anamorphic projection can be seen quite commonly on text written at a very flat angle on roadways, such as "Bus Lane" or "Children Crossing", to make it easily read by drivers who otherwise would have difficulty reading obliquely as the vehicle approaches the text; when the vehicle is nearly above the text, its true abnormally elongated shape can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Section 3B.20 Pavement Word, Symbol, and Arrow Markings|url=https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part3/part3b.htm#section3B20|work=[[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]]|publisher=United States [[Federal Highway Administration]]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in many sporting stadiums, especially in [[Rugby football]] in [[Australia]], it is used to promote company brands which are painted onto the playing surface; from the television camera angle, the writing appear as signs standing vertically within the field of play.

Much writing on shop windows is in principle anamorphic, as it was written mirror-reversed on the inside of the window glass.

==In the work of contemporary artists==
[[File:Manfred Stader Stocznia Szczecinska 1 (Piotr Kuczynski).jpg|thumb|Anamorphic street art by [[Manfred Stader]]]]
While not a widespread in contemporary art, anamorphosis as a technique has been used by contemporary artists in painting, photography,  [[printmaking]], sculpture, film and video, digital art and games, [[holography]],&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; [[street art]] and [[Installation art|installation]]. The latter two art forms are largely practised in public areas such as parks, city centres and transit stations&lt;ref name="WebUrbanist"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=SA |title=Perspective Puzzle: Anamorphic Art in the Toronto Subway |url=https://weburbanist.com/2010/05/08/perspective-puzzle-anamorphic-art-in-the-toronto-subway/ |website=WebUrbanist |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1975 a major exhibition was held focusing exclusively on anamorphic imagery - ''Anamorphoses: Games of Perception and Illusion in Art''. The artist [[Jan Beutener]] created ''The Room'' - a major new installation - specifically for the exhibit.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

The ''Presence of Absence'' is an ongoing exhibition focusing on anamorphic art. It features work by [[Patrick Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

===Sculpture and Installation===
[[File:West Bromwich Bus Station - sign and mosaic's (5580214957).jpg|thumb|Anamorphic mosaic art in a [[West Bromwich]] bus station.]]

Since the mid-20th century, many artists have made use of anamorphosis in public artworks. American [[Land art]] pioneer [[Michael Heizer|Michael Heizer's]] ''Complex One'' (1972-1974), a massive earth and concrete structure in the [[Nevada]] desert, creates a rectangular frame for a [[mastaba]] when viewed from a specific location.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; Inspired by [[Luxor]] and other ancient monumental sites, it is part of the larger work ''City'', an enormous sculpture running a mile and a half long. The entire work will not be completed until 2020.&lt;ref name="New Yorker 2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goodyear |first1=Dana |title=A Monument to Outlast Humanity |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/29/michael-heizers-city |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=20 November 2018 |date=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[Marcus Raetz]] created anamorphic sculptures ranging in size from large-scale public installation to something that could fit in your hand. One of his largest pieces, ''Kopf'', revealed the form of a person's head in profile when viewed from a specific vantage-point. It was installed in a public park in [[Basel, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

[[Shigeo Fukuda]], a Japanese artist and designer globally renowned for his satirical posters on anti-war and environmental advocacy&lt;ref name="NYT Fukuda"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Heller |first1=Steven |title=Shigeo Fukuda, Graphic Designer of Wit and Allusion, Dies at 76 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/arts/design/20fukuda.html |accessdate=18 November 2018 |date=19 January 2009 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, created posters and sculptures making use of both types of anamorphosis in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="illusionworks Fukada"&gt;{{cite web |title=Art of Shigeo Fukada |url=https://psy2.psych.tu-dresden.de/i1/kaw/diverses%20Material/www.illusionworks.com/html/art_of_shigeo_fukuda.html |publisher=Illusionworks |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote multiple books on the topic of optical illusions.

While anamorphic images were not his exclusive area of focus, the American artist [[Jonathan Borofsky]] created installations in the 1980's using anamorphic techniques, exhibiting at institutions such as the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt; 

[[File:Fréhel vue d'ensemble 1.jpg|thumb|Jean-Max Albert, ''Un carré pour un square'', from the specific vantage point, Place Fréhel, Paris(1988)]]
[[Jean-Max Albert]] created three public sculptures using anamorphosis:''Un carré pour un square'', ''Cube fantôme'' and ''Reflet anamorphose'' (1985). &lt;ref&gt;http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/SpaceMathArticle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jonty Hurwitz]], pioneered the use of a mathematical technique to create [[Catoptrics|Catoptric]] sculptures that resolve in a cylinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher Jobson|date=January 21, 2013|website=Colossal|title=The Skewed, Anamorphic Sculptures and Engineered Illusions of Jonty Hurwitz|url=http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/01/the-skewed-anamorphic-sculptures-and-engineered-illusions-of-jonty-hurwitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 he produced a public work for the [[Savoy Hotel]]'s River Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alice Jones|title=A homage to Kaspar the friendly cat checks in at the Savoy's new eatery|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/a-homage-to-kaspar-the-friendly-cat-checks-in-at-the-savoys-new-eatery-8600305.html|date=May 2, 2013|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Several academic papers have been written about his work, notably, *''A simplified procedure for anamorphic sculpture'', 2015.

In 2011, French artist [[François Abélanet]]'s anamorphic garden work ''Qui croire? (Who to believe?)'' was featured in front of the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Adams|first=Henry|title=Is a "Garden" the World's Greatest New Artwork?|date=Nov 29, 2011|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/art/2011/11/is-a-garden-the-worlds-greatest-new-artwork/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Felice Varini|Felici Varini's]] 2014 work ''Three Ellipses for Three Locks'' in [[Hasselt, Belgium]] is an image of three loops that are  made up of segments painted on to over 100 buildings. It is only visible from a specific vantage point over the city.&lt;ref name="EB Anamorphosis" /&gt;

===Drawing and Painting===
The Swedish artist Hans Hamngren produced and exhibited many examples of mirror anamorphosis in the 1960s and 1970s. 

===Photography===
Beginning in 1967, Dutch artist [[Jan Dibbets]] based an entire series of photographic work titled ''Perspective Corrections'' on the distortion of reality through perspective anamorphosis. This involved the incorporation of land art into his work, where areas dug out of the Earth formed squares from specific perspectives.&lt;ref name="Collins 1992" /&gt;

===Street Art===
Anamorphic effects are popular in street art, sometimes called "Slant Art" when accomplished on sidewalks. Examples are the [[sidewalk chalk]] drawings of [[Kurt Wenner]] and [[Julian Beever]]&lt;ref name="WebUrbanist" /&gt;, where the chalked image, the pavement, and the architectural surroundings all become part of an illusion. Art of this style can be produced by taking a photograph of an object or setting at a sharp oblique angle, then putting a grid over the photograph. Another elongated grid is placed on the sidewalk based on a specific perspective, and visual elements of one are transcribed into the other, one grid square at a time.

In 2016, the street artist [[JR (artist)|JR]] completed a massive temporary anamorphic illusion over the [[Louvre|Louvre's]] pyramid, making the modern structure disappear and the original building appear as though it was still in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="JR 2016"&gt;{{cite web |title=JR completes monumental anamorphic artwork on the louvre's glass pyramid |url=https://www.designboom.com/art/jr-louvre-museum-installation-paris-05-24-2016/ |website=designboom architecture &amp; design magazine |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7625">In [[mathematics]], an '''approximate group''' is a subset of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] which behaves like a [[subgroup]] "up to a constant error", in a precise quantitative sense (so the term '''approximate subgroup''' may be more correct). For example, it is required that the set of products of elements in the subset be not much bigger than the subset itself (while for a subgroup it is required that they be equal). The notion was introduced in the 2010s but can be traced to older sources in [[additive combinatorics]].

== Formal definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;K \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;; for two subsets &lt;math&gt;X, Y \subset G&lt;/math&gt; we denote by &lt;math&gt;X\cdot Y&lt;/math&gt; the set of all products &lt;math&gt;xy, x\in X, y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;. A non-empty subset &lt;math&gt;A \subset G&lt;/math&gt; is a ''&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-approximate subgroup'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if:{{sfn|Green|2012}} 
# It is symmetric, that is if &lt;math&gt;g \in A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;g^{-1} \in A&lt;/math&gt;; 
# There exists a subset &lt;math&gt;X \subset G&lt;/math&gt; of cardinality &lt;math&gt;|X| \le K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A \cdot A \subset X\cdot A&lt;/math&gt;. 
It is immediately verified that a 1-approximate subgroup is the same thing as a genuine subgroup. Of course this definition is only interesting when &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is small compared to &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt; (in particular, any subset &lt;math&gt;B \subset G&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;|B|&lt;/math&gt;-approximate subgroup). In applications it is often used with &lt;matH&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; being fixed and &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt; going to infinity.

Examples of approximate subgroups which are not groups are given by symmetric intervals and more generally [[arithmetic progression]]s in the integers. Indeed, for all &lt;math&gt;n \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; the subset &lt;math&gt;X = [-N, N] \subset \mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; is a 2-approximate subgroup: the set &lt;math&gt;X + X = [-2N, 2N]&lt;/math&gt; is contained in the union of the two translates &lt;math&gt;X + N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X - N&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. A ''generalised arithmetic progression'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; is a subset in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;\{n_1x_1 + \cdots + n_dx_d : |n_i| \le N_i\}&lt;/math&gt;, and it is a &lt;math&gt;2^d&lt;/math&gt;-approximate subgroup.

A more general example is given by balls in the [[word metric]] in finitely generated [[nilpotent group]]s.

== Classification of approximate subgroups ==

Approximate subgroups of the integer group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; were completely classified by [[Imre Z. Ruzsa]] and Freiman.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | ref=harv | first=I. Z. | last=Ruzsa | authorlink = Imre Z. Ruzsa | title=Generalized arithmetical progressions and sumsets | journal=Acta Math. Hungar. | volume=65 | issue=4 | pages=379&amp;ndash;388 | year=1994 | doi=10.1007/bf01876039}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is stated as follows: 
:''For any &lt;math&gt;K \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; there are &lt;math&gt;C_K, c_K &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-approximate subgroup &lt;math&gt;A \subset \mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; there exists a generalised arithmetic progression &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; generated by at most &lt;math&gt;C_K&lt;/math&gt; integers and containing at least &lt;math&gt;c_K|A|&lt;/math&gt; elements, such that &lt;math&gt;A+A+A+A \supset P&lt;/math&gt;. ''
The constants &lt;math&gt;C_K, C_K', c_K&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated sharply.{{sfn|Breuillard|Green|Tao|2012|loc=Theorem 2.1}} In particular &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is contained in at most &lt;math&gt;C_K'&lt;/math&gt;translates of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;: this means that approximate subgroups of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; are "almost" generalised arithmetic progressions.

The work of Breuillard&amp;ndash;Green&amp;ndash;Tao (the culmination of an effort started a few years earlier by various other people) is a vast generalisation of this result. In a very general form its statement is the following:{{sfn|Breuillard|Green|Tao|2012|loc=Theorem 1.6}} 
:''Let &lt;math&gt;K \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;; there exists &lt;math&gt;C_K&lt;/math&gt; such that the following holds. Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; a &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-approximate subgroup in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. There exists subgroups &lt;math&gt;H \triangleleft G_0 \le G&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; finite and &lt;math&gt;G_0/H&lt;/math&gt; nilpotent such that &lt;math&gt;A^4 \supset H&lt;/math&gt;, the subgroup generated by &lt;math&gt;A^4&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;G_0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A \subset X\cdot G_0&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|X| \le C_K&lt;/math&gt;. '' 
The statement also gives some information on the characteristics (rank and step) of the nilpotent group &lt;math&gt;G_0/H&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Finite groups of Lie type|finite matrix group]] the results can be made more precise, for instance:{{sfn|Breuillard|2015|loc=Theorem 4.8}} 
:''Let &lt;matH&gt;K \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; there is a constant &lt;math&gt;C_d&lt;/math&gt; such that for any finite field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_q&lt;/math&gt;, any simple subgroup &lt;math&gt;G \subset \mathrm{GL}_d(\mathbb F_q)&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-approximate subgroup &lt;math&gt;A \subset G&lt;/math&gt; then either &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is contained in a proper subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;|A| \le K^{C_d}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;|A| \ge |G|/K^{C_d}&lt;/math&gt;. ''
The theorem applies for example to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_d(\mathbb F_q)&lt;/math&gt;; the point is that the constant does not depend on the cardinality &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; of the field. In some sense this says that there are no interesting approximate subgroups (besides genuine subgroups) in finite simple linear groups (they are either "trivial", that is very small, or "not proper", that is almost equal to the whole group).

== Applications ==

The Breuillard&amp;ndash;Green&amp;ndash;Tao theorem on classification of approximate groups can be used to give a new proof of [[Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth]]. The result obtained is actually a bit stronger since it establishes that there exists a "[[Growth rate (group theory)|growth]] gap" between virtually nilpotent groups (of polynomial growth) and other groups; that is, there exists a (superpolynomial) function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that any group with growth function bounded by a multiple of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is virtually nilpotent.{{sfn|Breuillard|Green|Tao|2012|loc=Theorem 1.11}}

Other applications are to the construction of [[expander graph]]s from the Cayley graphs of finite simple groups, and to the related topic of [[superstrong approximation]].{{sfn|Breuillard|2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ref=harv | last1=Helfgott | first1=Harald | last2=Seress | first2=&amp;Aacute;kos | last3=Zuk | first3=Andrzej | title=Expansion in the symmetric groups | journal=Journal of Algebra | volume=421 | year=2015 | pages=349&amp;ndash;368 | arxiv=1311.6742 | doi=10.1016/j.jalgebra.2014.08.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Archives of American Mathematics,''' located at the [[University of Texas at Austin]],  aims to collect, preserve, and provide access to the papers principally of American mathematicians and the records of American mathematical organizations.

==  History  ==

The Archives  began in 1975 at the University of Texas at Austin with the preservation of the papers of Texas mathematicians [[Robert Lee Moore|R.L. Moore]] and [[Harry Vandiver|H.S. Vandiver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corry|first=Leo|date=2007|title=A Clash of Mathematical Titans in Austin: Robert Lee Moore and Harry Schultz Vandiver (1924-1974)|url=|journal=Mathematical Intelligencer|volume=29|pages=62–74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the [[Mathematical Association of America]] established the university as the official repository for its archival records and the name "Archives of American Mathematics" was adopted to encompass all of the mathematical archival collections at the university.&lt;ref&gt;The Minutes of the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, 8–9 June 1978. https://www.utsystem.edu/sites/default/files/offices/board-of-regents/board-meetings/board-minutes/6-78meeting754.pdf pp. 3307-3312, accessed 17 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally a part of the [[Harry Ransom Center]], in 1984, the Archives was added to the special collections of the [[Dolph Briscoe Center for American History|Briscoe Center for American History]] at the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mead|first1=Carol|last2=Lewis|first2=Albert C.|date=September 2017|title=The Archives of American Mathematics|url=http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2017-09-105.pdf|journal=Newsletter of the European Mathematical Society|volume=105|pages=34–38|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6876">In [[mathematics]], the '''Artin–Hasse exponential''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|last1=Artin|last2=Hasse|author1-link=Emil Artin|author2-link=Helmut Hasse|year=1928}}, is the [[power series]] given by

:&lt;math&gt; E_p(x) = \exp\left(x + \frac{x^p}{p} + \frac{x^{p^2}}{p^2} + \frac{x^{p^3}}{p^3} +\cdots\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Motivation==

One motivation for considering this series to be analogous to the exponential function comes from infinite products. In the ring of formal power series '''Q'''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; we have the identity

::&lt;math&gt;e^x = \prod_{n \geq 1}(1-x^n)^{-\mu(n)/n},&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;mu;(n) is the [[Möbius function]].  This identity can be verified by showing the logarithmic derivative of the two sides are equal and that both sides have the same constant term.  In a similar way, one can verify a product expansion for the Artin–Hasse exponential:

::&lt;math&gt;E_p(x) = \prod_{(p,n)=1}(1-x^n)^{-\mu(n)/n}.&lt;/math&gt;

So passing from a product over all ''n'' to a product over only ''n'' prime to ''p'', which is a typical operation in ''p''-adic analysis, leads from ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').

The coefficients of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are rational. We can use either formula for ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') to prove that, unlike ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, all of its coefficients are ''p''-integral; in other words, the denominators of the coefficients of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are not divisible by ''p''.  A first proof uses the definition of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') and '''Dwork's lemma''', which says that a power series ''f''(''x'') = 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;... with rational coefficients has ''p''-integral coefficients if and only if ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;)/''f''(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 mod ''p'''''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  When  ''f''(''x'') = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), we have ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;)/''f''(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''px''&lt;/sup&gt;, whose constant term is 1 and all higher coefficients are in ''p'''''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.
A second proof comes from the infinite product for ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''): each exponent -&amp;mu;(''n'')/''n'' for ''n'' not divisible by ''p'' is a ''p''-integral, and when a rational number ''a'' is ''p''-integral all coefficients in the binomial expansion of (1 - ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt; are ''p''-integral by ''p''-adic continuity of the binomial coefficient polynomials ''t''(''t''-1)...(''t''-''k''+1)/''k''! in ''t'' together with their obvious integrality when ''t'' is a nonnegative integer (''a'' is a ''p''-adic limit of nonnegative integers) . Thus each factor in the product of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') has ''p''-integral coefficients, so ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') itself has ''p''-integral coefficients.

==Combinatorial interpretation==
The Artin–Hasse exponential is the [[generating function]] for the probability a uniformly randomly selected element of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (the [[symmetric group]] with ''n'' elements) has ''p''-power order (the number of which is denoted by ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''p,n''&lt;/sub&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;E_p(x)=\sum_{n\ge 0} \frac{t_{p,n}}{n!}x^n.&lt;/math&gt;

This gives a third proof that the coefficients of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are ''p''-integral, using the [[Frobenius's theorem (group theory)|theorem of Frobenius]] that in a finite group of order divisible by ''d'' the number of elements of order dividing ''d'' is also divisible by ''d''. Apply this theorem to the ''n''th symmetric group with ''d'' equal to the highest power of ''p'' dividing ''n''!.

More generally, for any topologically finitely generated profinite group ''G'' there is an identity
:&lt;math&gt;\exp(\sum_{H \subset G} x^{[G:H]}/[G:H])=\sum_{n\ge 0} \frac{a_{G,n}}{n!}x^n,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''H'' runs over open subgroups of ''G'' with finite index (there are finitely many of each index since ''G'' is topologically finitely generated) and ''a&lt;sub&gt;G,n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of continuous homomorphisms from ''G'' to ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.  Two special cases are worth noting. (1) If ''G'' is the ''p''-adic integers, it has exactly one open subgroup of each ''p''-power index and a continuous homomorphism from ''G'' to ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is essentially the same thing as choosing an element of ''p''-power order in ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', so we have recovered the above combinatorial interpretation of the Taylor coefficients in the Artin–Hasse exponential series. (2) If ''G'' is a finite group then the sum in the exponential is a finite sum running over all subgroups of ''G'', and continuous homomorphisms from ''G'' to ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are simply homomorphisms from ''G'' to ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. The result in this case is due to Wohlfahrt (1977).  The special case when ''G'' is a finite cyclic group is due to Chowla, Herstein, and Scott (1952), and takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;\exp(\sum_{d|m} x^d/d)=\sum_{n\ge 0} \frac{a_{m,n}}{n!}x^n,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a&lt;sub&gt;m,n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of solutions to ''g&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' = 1 in ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.

David Roberts provided a natural combinatorial link between the Artin–Hasse exponential and the regular exponential in the spirit of the ergodic perspective (linking the ''p''-adic and regular norms over the rationals) by showing that the Artin–Hasse exponential is also the generating function for the probability that an element of the symmetric group is [[unipotent]] in [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''p'', whereas the regular exponential is the probability that an element of the same group is unipotent in characteristic zero.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Conjectures==

At the 2002 [[PROMYS]] program, Keith Conrad conjectured that the coefficients of &lt;math&gt;E_p(x)&lt;/math&gt; are uniformly distributed in the  [[p-adic number|p-adic]] integers with respect to the normalized Haar measure, with supporting computational evidence. The problem is still open.

Dinesh Thakur has also posed the problem of whether the Artin–Hasse exponential reduced mod ''p'' is transcendental over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_p(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]],  a '''block design''' is a set together with a [[Family of sets|family of subsets]] (repeated subsets are allowed at times) whose members are chosen to satisfy some set of properties that are deemed useful for a particular application. These applications come from many areas, including [[experimental design]], [[finite geometry]], [[software testing]], [[cryptography]], and [[algebraic geometry]].  Many variations have been examined, but the most intensely studied are the '''balanced incomplete block designs''' (BIBDs or 2-designs) which historically were related to statistical issues in the [[design of experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pp.17−19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stinson|2003|loc=p.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A block design in which all the blocks have the same size is called ''uniform''. The designs discussed in this article are all uniform.  [[Combinatorial design#pairwise balanced design|Pairwise balanced designs (PBDs)]] are examples of block designs that are not necessarily uniform.

==Definition of a BIBD (or 2-design)==

Given a finite set ''X'' (of elements called ''points'') and integers ''k'', ''r'', ''λ'' ≥ 1, we define a ''2-design'' (or ''BIBD'', standing for balanced incomplete block design) ''B'' to be a family of ''k''-element subsets of ''X'', called ''blocks'', such that any ''x'' in ''X'' is contained in ''r'' blocks, and any pair of distinct points ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X'' is contained in ''λ'' blocks.

"Family" in the above definition can be replaced by "set" if repeated blocks are not allowed. Designs in which repeated blocks are not allowed are called ''simple''.

Here ''v'' (the number of elements of ''X'', called points), ''b'' (the number of blocks), ''k'', ''r'', and λ are the ''parameters'' of the design.  (To avoid degenerate examples, it is also assumed that ''v'' &gt; ''k'', so that no block contains all the elements of the set. This is the meaning of "incomplete" in the name of these designs.) In a table:
:{| class="wikitable"
| ''v'' || points, number of elements of ''X''
|-
| ''b'' || number of blocks
|-
| ''r'' || number of blocks containing a given point
|-
| ''k'' || number of points in a block
|-
| ''λ'' || number of blocks containing any 2 (or more generally ''t'') distinct points
|-
|}

The design is called a (''v'', ''k'', ''λ'')-design or a (''v'', ''b'', ''r'', ''k'', ''λ'')-design.  The parameters are not all independent; ''v'', ''k'', and λ determine ''b'' and ''r'', and not all combinations of ''v'', ''k'', and ''λ'' are possible.  The two basic equations connecting these parameters are
:&lt;math&gt; bk = vr, &lt;/math&gt; 
obtained by counting the number of pairs (''B'', ''p'') where ''B'' is a block and ''p'' is a point in that block, and
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda(v-1) = r(k-1), &lt;/math&gt;
obtained from the count of triples (''p'', ''q'', ''B'') where ''p'' and ''q'' are distinct points and ''B'' is a block that contains them both, and dividing this count by ''v''.

These conditions are not sufficient as, for example, a (43,7,1)-design  does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Proved by Tarry in 1900 who showed that there was no pair of orthogonal [[Latin square]]s of order six. The 2-design with the indicated parameters is equivalent to the existence of five mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order six.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''order'' of a 2-design is defined to be ''n'' = ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''λ''.  The '''complement''' of a 2-design is obtained by replacing each block with its complement in the point set ''X''.  It is also a 2-design and has parameters ''v''′ = ''v'', ''b''′ = ''b'', ''r''′ = ''b''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''r'', ''k''′ = ''v''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''k'', ''λ''′ = ''λ''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2''r''.  A 2-design and its complement have the same order.

A fundamental theorem, [[Fisher's inequality]], named after the statistician [[Ronald Fisher]], is that ''b''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''v'' in any 2-design.

==Examples==
The unique (6,3,2)-design has 10 blocks (''b'' = 10) and each element is repeated 5 times (''r'' = 5).&lt;ref name="ex"&gt;{{harvnb|Colburn|Dinitz|loc=p. 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the symbols 0 − 5, the blocks are the following triples:
: 012 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  013 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  024 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  035 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  045 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  125 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  134 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  145 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  234 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  235.

One of four nonisomorphic (8,4,3)-designs has 14 blocks with each element repeated 7 times. Using the symbols 0 − 7 the blocks are the following 4-tuples:&lt;ref name="ex" /&gt;
: 0123 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0124 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0156 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0257 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0345 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0367 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 0467 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1267 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1346 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1357 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1457 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2347 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2356 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2456.

The unique (7,3,1)-design has 7 blocks with each element repeated 3 times. Using the symbols 0 − 6, the blocks are the following triples:&lt;ref name="ex" /&gt;
: 013 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  026 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  045 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  124 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  156 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  235 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  346. If the elements are thought as points on a [[Fano plane]], then these blocks are the lines.

==Symmetric BIBDs==

The case of equality in Fisher's inequality, that is, a 2-design with an equal number of points and blocks, is called a '''symmetric design'''.&lt;ref&gt;They have also been referred to as ''projective designs'' or ''square designs''. These alternatives have been used in an attempt to replace the term "symmetric", since there is nothing symmetric (in the usual meaning of the term) about these designs. The use of ''projective'' is due to P.Dembowski (''Finite Geometries'', Springer, 1968), in analogy with the most common example, projective planes, while ''square'' is due to P. Cameron (''Designs, Graphs, Codes and their Links'', Cambridge, 1991) and captures the implication of v = b on the incidence matrix. Neither term has caught on as a replacement and these designs are still universally referred to as ''symmetric''.&lt;/ref&gt; Symmetric designs have the smallest number of blocks among all the 2-designs with the same number of points.

In a symmetric design ''r'' = ''k'' holds as well as ''b'' = ''v'', and, while it is generally not true in arbitrary 2-designs, in a symmetric design every two distinct blocks meet in ''λ'' points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stinson|2003|loc=pg.23, Theorem 2.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theorem of [[H. J. Ryser|Ryser]] provides the converse.  If ''X'' is a ''v''-element set, and ''B'' is a ''v''-element set of ''k''-element subsets (the "blocks"), such that any two distinct blocks have exactly λ points in common, then (''X, B'') is a symmetric block design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ryser|1963|loc = pp. 102–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parameters of a symmetric design satisfy
::&lt;math&gt; \lambda (v-1) = k(k-1). &lt;/math&gt;
This imposes strong restrictions on ''v'', so the number of points is far from arbitrary.  The [[Bruck–Ryser–Chowla theorem]] gives necessary, but not sufficient, conditions for the existence of a symmetric design in terms of these parameters.

The following are important examples of symmetric 2-designs:

===Projective planes===
{{main|Projective plane}}

[[Projective plane#Finite projective planes|Finite projective planes]] are symmetric 2-designs with ''λ'' = 1 and order ''n'' &gt; 1. For these designs the symmetric design equation becomes:

::&lt;math&gt;v-1 = k(k-1).&lt;/math&gt;

Since  ''k'' = ''r'' we can write the ''order of a projective plane'' as ''n'' = ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 and, from the displayed equation above, we obtain ''v'' = (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)''n'' &amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp; 1 = ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp; ''n'' &amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp; 1 points in a projective plane of order ''n''.

As a projective plane is a symmetric design, we have ''b'' = ''v'', meaning that ''b'' = ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp; ''n'' &amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp; 1 also. The number ''b'' is the number of ''lines'' of the projective plane. There can be no repeated lines since λ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, so a projective plane is a simple 2-design in which the number of lines and the number of points are always the same. For a projective plane, ''k'' is the number of points on each line and it is equal to ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.  Similarly, ''r'' = ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is the number of lines with which a given point is incident.

For ''n'' = 2 we get a projective plane of order 2, also called the [[Fano plane]], with ''v'' = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7 points and 7 lines. In the Fano plane, each line has ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 = 3 points and each point belongs to ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 lines.

Projective planes are known to exist for all orders which are prime numbers or powers of primes. They form the only known infinite family (with respect to having a constant λ value) of symmetric block designs.&lt;ref name="Hughes 1985 loc=pg.109"&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Piper|1985|loc=pg.109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biplanes===
A '''biplane''' or '''biplane geometry''' is a symmetric 2-design with ''λ'' = 2; that is, every set of two points is contained in two blocks ("lines"), while any two lines intersect in two points.&lt;ref name="Hughes 1985 loc=pg.109"&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Piper|1985|loc=pg.109}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar to  finite projective planes, except that rather than two points determining one line (and two lines determining one point), two points determine two lines (respectively, points). A biplane of order ''n'' is one whose blocks have ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 points; it has ''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2)(''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)/2 points (since ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'').

The 18 known examples&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1986|loc=pp.320-335}}&lt;/ref&gt; are listed below.
* (Trivial) The order 0 biplane has 2 points (and lines of size 2;  a 2-(2,2,2) design); it is two points, with two blocks, each consisting of both points. Geometrically, it is the [[digon]].
* The order 1 biplane has 4 points (and lines of size 3; a 2-(4,3,2) design); it is the complete design with ''v'' = 4 and ''k'' = 3. Geometrically, the points are the vertices and the blocks are the faces of a tetrahedron.
* The order 2 biplane is the complement of the [[Fano plane]]: it has 7 points (and lines of size 4; a 2-(7,4,2)), where the lines are given as the ''complements'' of the (3-point) lines in the Fano plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Assmus|Key|1992|loc=pg.55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The order 3 biplane has 11 points (and lines of size 5; a 2-(11,5,2)), and is also known as the '''{{visible anchor|Paley biplane}}''' after [[Raymond Paley]]; it is associated to the [[Paley digraph]] of order 11, which is constructed using the field with 11 elements, and is the [[#Hadamard 2-designs|Hadamard 2-design]] associated to the size 12 Hadamard matrix; see [[Paley construction#Paley construction I|Paley construction I]].
:Algebraically this corresponds to the exceptional embedding of the [[projective special linear group]] ''PSL''(2,5) in ''PSL''(2,11) – see [[Projective linear group#Action on p points|projective linear group: action on ''p'' points]] for details.&lt;ref name="martinsingerman"&gt;{{citation | title = From Biplanes to the Klein quartic and the Buckyball | first1 = Pablo | last1 = Martin | first2 = David | last2 = Singerman | date = April 17, 2008 | url = http://www.neverendingbooks.org/DATA/biplanesingerman.pdf | page = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are three biplanes of order 4 (and 16 points, lines of size 6; a 2-(16,6,2)).  These three designs are also [[Regular Hadamard matrix|Menon designs]].
* There are four biplanes of order 7 (and 37 points, lines of size 9; a 2-(37,9,2)).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Salwach|Mezzaroba|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are five biplanes of order 9 (and 56 points, lines of size 11; a 2-(56,11,2)).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaski|Östergård|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two biplanes are known of order 11 (and 79 points, lines of size 13; a 2-(79,13,2)).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aschbacher|1971|loc=pp. 279–281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hadamard 2-designs===
An [[Hadamard matrix]] of size ''m'' is an ''m'' × ''m'' matrix '''H''' whose entries are ±1 such that '''HH'''&lt;sup&gt;⊤&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;m'''I'''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, where '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;⊤&lt;/sup&gt; is the transpose of '''H''' and '''I'''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''m''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''m'' identity matrix. An Hadamard matrix can be put into ''standardized form'' (that is, converted to an equivalent Hadamard matrix) where the first row and first column entries are all +1. If the size ''m''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2 then ''m'' must be a multiple of 4.

Given an Hadamard matrix of size 4''a'' in standardized form, remove the first row and first column and convert every −1 to a 0. The resulting 0–1 matrix '''M''' is the [[incidence matrix]] of a symmetric 2-(4''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, 2''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, ''a''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) design called an '''Hadamard 2-design'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stinson|2003|loc=pg. 74, Theorem 4.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It contains &lt;math&gt;4a-1&lt;/math&gt; blocks/points; each contains/is contained in &lt;math&gt;2a-1&lt;/math&gt; points/blocks. Each pair of points is contained in exactly &lt;math&gt;a-1&lt;/math&gt; blocks.

This construction is reversible, and the incidence matrix of a symmetric 2-design with these parameters can be used to form an Hadamard matrix of size 4''a''.

==Resolvable 2-designs==
A '''resolvable 2-design''' is a BIBD whose blocks can be partitioned into sets (called ''parallel classes''), each of which forms a partition of the point set of the BIBD. The set of parallel classes is called a ''resolution'' of the design.

If a 2-(''v'',''k'',λ) resolvable design has ''c'' parallel classes, then ''b'' &amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''v''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Piper|1985|loc=pg. 156, Theorem 5.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, a symmetric design can not have a non-trivial (more than one parallel class) resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Piper|1985|loc=pg. 158, Corollary 5.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archetypical resolvable 2-designs are the finite [[projective plane#Affine planes|affine planes]].  A solution of the famous [[15 schoolgirl problem]] is a resolution of a 2-(15,3,1) design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beth|Jungnickel|Lenz|1986|loc=pg. 40 Example 5.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalization: ''t''-designs==
&lt;div id='t-design' &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Given any positive integer ''t'', a ''t''-design ''B'' is a class of ''k''-element subsets of ''X'', called ''blocks'', such that every point ''x'' in ''X'' appears in exactly ''r'' blocks, and every ''t''-element subset ''T'' appears in exactly λ blocks.  The numbers ''v'' (the number of elements of ''X''), ''b'' (the number of blocks), ''k'', ''r'', λ, and ''t'' are the ''parameters'' of the design.  The design may be called a ''t''-(''v'',''k'',λ)-design.  Again, these four numbers determine ''b'' and ''r'' and the four numbers themselves cannot be chosen arbitrarily.  The equations are

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_i = \lambda \left.\binom{v-i}{t-i} \right/ \binom{k-i}{t-i} \text{ for } i = 0,1,\ldots,t, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''λ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of blocks that contain any ''i''-element set of points.

Note that &lt;math&gt;b=\lambda_0 = \lambda {v\choose t} / {k\choose t}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Theorem''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stinson|2003|loc=pg.203, Corollary 9.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any ''t''-(''v'',''k'',λ)-design is also an ''s''-(''v'',''k'',λ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;)-design for any ''s'' with 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''s''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''t''. (Note that the "lambda value" changes as above and depends on ''s''.)

A consequence of this theorem is that every ''t''-design with ''t'' ≥ 2 is also a 2-design.

A ''t''-(''v'',''k'',1)-design is called a [[Steiner system]].

The term ''block design'' by itself usually means a 2-design.

===Derived and extendable t-designs===
Let '''D''' = (''X'', ''B'') be a t-(''v'',''k'',''λ'') design and ''p'' a point of ''X''. The ''derived design'' ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; has point set ''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;{''p''} and as block set all the blocks of '''D''' which contain p with p removed. It is a (''t''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-(''v''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, ''λ'') design. Note that derived designs with respect to different points may not be isomorphic. A design '''E''' is called an ''extension'' of '''D''' if '''E''' has a point p such that '''E'''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to '''D'''; we call '''D''' ''extendable'' if it has an extension.

'''Theorem''':&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Piper|1985|loc=pg.29}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a  ''t''-(''v'',''k'',''λ'') design has an extension, then ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 divides ''b''(''v''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1).

The only extendable [[projective plane]]s (symmetric 2-(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, 1) designs) are those of orders 2 and&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|van Lint|1991|loc=pg. 11, Proposition 1.34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Hadamard 2-design is extendable (to an '''Hadamard 3-design''').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|Piper|1985|loc=pg. 132, Theorem 4.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem''':.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|van Lint|1991|loc=pg. 11, Theorem 1.35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If '''D''', a symmetric 2-(''v'',''k'',λ) design, is extendable, then one of the following holds:
# '''D''' is an Hadamard 2-design,
# ''v'' &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; (λ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2)(λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4λ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2), ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3λ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1,
# ''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;495, ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;39, λ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.

Note that the projective plane of order two is an Hadamard 2-design; the projective plane of order four has parameters which fall in case 2; the only other known symmetric 2-designs with parameters in case 2 are the order 9 biplanes, but none of them are extendable; and there is no known symmetric 2-design with the parameters of case 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Colbourn|Dinitz|2007|loc=pg. 114, Remarks 6.35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inversive planes====
A design with the parameters of the extension of an [[affine plane (incidence geometry)#Finite affine plane|affine plane]], i.e., a 3-(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, 1) design, is called a finite '''inversive plane''', or [[Möbius plane]], of order&amp;nbsp;''n''.

It is possible to give a geometric description of some inversive planes, indeed, of all known inversive planes. An ''[[Ovoid (projective geometry)|ovoid]]'' in PG(3,''q'') is a set of ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 points, no three collinear. It can be shown that every plane (which is a hyperplane since the geometric dimension is 3) of PG(3,''q'') meets an ovoid ''O'' in either 1 or ''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 points. The plane sections of size ''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 of ''O'' are the blocks of an inversive plane of order&amp;nbsp;''q''. Any inversive plane arising this way is called ''egglike''. All known inversive planes are egglike.

An example of an ovoid is the [[Quadric (projective geometry)|elliptic quadric]], the set of zeros of the quadratic form
::: ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), 
where f is an irreducible [[quadratic form]] in two variables over GF(''q''). [''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''xy'' + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for example].

If ''q'' is an odd power of 2, another type of ovoid is known – the [[Ovoid (projective geometry)|Suzuki–Tits ovoid]].

'''Theorem'''.  Let ''q'' be a positive integer, at least 2.  (a) If ''q'' is odd, then any ovoid is projectively equivalent to the elliptic quadric in a projective geometry PG(3,''q''); so ''q'' is a prime power and there is a unique egglike inversive plane of order ''q''. (But it is unknown if non-egglike ones exist.)  (b) if ''q'' is even, then ''q'' is a power of 2 and any inversive plane of order ''q'' is egglike (but there may be some unknown ovoids).

==Partially balanced designs (PBIBDs)==

An ''n''-class [[association scheme]] consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' of size ''v'' together with a [[partition of a set|partition]] ''S'' of ''X'' &amp;times; ''X'' into ''n'' + 1 [[binary relation]]s, R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;. A pair of elements in relation R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are said to be ''i''th&amp;ndash;''associates''. Each element of ''X'' has ''n''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; ''i''th associates. Furthermore:

*&lt;math&gt;R_{0}=\{(x,x):x\in X\}&lt;/math&gt; and is called the [[Identity relation]]. 
*Defining &lt;math&gt; R^* :=\{(x,y) | (y,x)\in R\}&lt;/math&gt;, if ''R'' in ''S'', then ''R*'' in ''S''
*If &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in R_{k}&lt;/math&gt;, the number of &lt;math&gt;z\in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(x,z)\in R_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(z,y)\in R_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant &lt;math&gt;p^k_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; depending on ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' but not on the particular choice of ''x'' and ''y''.

An association scheme is ''commutative'' if &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}^k=p_{ji}^k&lt;/math&gt; for all ''i'', ''j'' and ''k''. Most authors assume this property.

A '''partially balanced incomplete block design''' with ''n'' associate classes (PBIBD(''n'')) is a block design based on a ''v''-set X with ''b'' blocks each of size ''k'' and with each element appearing in ''r'' blocks, such that there is an association scheme with ''n'' classes defined on ''X'' where, if elements ''x'' and ''y'' are ''i''th associates, 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n'', then they are together in precisely λ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; blocks.

A PBIBD(''n'') determines an association scheme but the converse is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Street|Street|1987|loc=pg. 237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''A''(3) be the following association scheme with three associate classes on the set ''X'' = {1,2,3,4,5,6}. The (''i'',''j'') entry is ''s'' if elements ''i'' and ''j'' are in relation R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Applications==
The mathematical subject of block designs originated in the statistical framework of [[design of experiments]]. These designs were especially useful in applications of the technique of [[Analysis of variance|analysis of variance (ANOVA)]]. This remains a significant area for the use of block designs.

While the origins of the subject are grounded in biological applications (as is some of the existing terminology), the designs are used in many applications where systematic comparisons are being made, such as in [[software testing]].

The [[incidence matrix]] of block designs provide a natural source of interesting [[block code]]s that are used as [[error correcting code]]s. The rows of their incidence matrices are also used as the symbols in a form of [[pulse-position modulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noshad|first1=Mohammad|last2=Brandt-Pearce|first2=Maite|title=Expurgated PPM Using Symmetric Balanced Incomplete Block Designs|journal=IEEE Communications Letters|date=Jul 2012|volume=16|issue=7|pages=968–971|doi=10.1109/LCOMM.2012.042512.120457|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205424|arxiv=1203.5378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statistical application ===
Suppose that skin cancer researchers want to test three different sunscreens. They coat two different sunscreens on the upper sides of the hands of a test person. After a UV radiation they record the skin irritation in terms of sunburn. The number of treatments is 3 (sunscreens) and the block size is 2 (hands per person).

A corresponding BIBD can be generated by the [[R]]-function ''design.bib'' of the [https://cran.r-project.org/package=agricolae R-package agricolae] and is specified in the following table:

{| class="wikitable"
!Plots
!Block
!Treatment
|-
|101
|1
|3
|-
|102
|1
|2
|-
|201
|2
|1
|-
|202
|2
|3
|-
|301
|3
|2
|-
|302
|3
|1
|}

The investigator chooses the parameters {{math|1=''v'' = 3}}, {{math|1=''k'' = 2}} and {{math|1= λ = 1}} for the block design which are then inserted into the R-function. Subsequently, the remaining parameters {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|r}} are determined automatically.

Using the basic relations we calculate that we need {{math|1=''b'' = 3}} blocks, that is, 3 test people in order to obtain a balanced incomplete block design. Labeling the blocks {{math|''A'', ''B''}} and {{mvar|C}}, to avoid confusion, we have the block design,
: {{math|1=''A'' = {2, 3}}}, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {{math|1=''B'' = {1, 3}}} and {{math|1=''C'' = {1, 2}}}.

A corresponding [[incidence matrix]] is specified in the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
!Treatment
!Block A
!Block B
!Block C
|-
|1
|0
|1
|1
|-
|2
|1
|0
|1
|-
|3
|1
|1
|0
|}

Each treatment occurs in 2 blocks, so {{math|1=''r'' = 2}}.

Just one block ({{mvar|C}}) contains the treatments 1 and 2 simultaneously and the same applies to the pairs of treatments (1,3) and (2,3). Therefore, {{math|1=λ = 1}}.

It is impossible to use a complete design (all treatments in each block) in this example because there are 3 sunscreens to test, but only 2 hands on each person.

In [[cryptography]], '''CRYPTON''' is a [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric]] [[block cipher]] submitted as a candidate for the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES). It is very efficient in hardware implementations and was designed by Chae Hoon Lim of Future Systems Inc.

The CRYPTON algorithm processes blocks of 128 bits in the form of 4×4 byte arrays. The round transformation consists of four steps: byte-wise substitution, column-wise bit permutation, column-to-row transposition and finally key addition. CRYPTON uses 12 rounds of this encryption process. Due to the algorithm's nature, the decryption process can be made identical to the encryption process using a different key.

[[File:Hyperbola one over x.svg|thumb|Diagrammatic representation of limits approaching infinity|The function ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''x''. As ''x'' approaches 0 from the right, ''y'' approaches infinity. As ''x'' approaches 0 from the left, ''y'' approaches negative infinity.]]

In [[mathematics]], '''division by zero''' is [[division (mathematics)|division]] where the divisor (denominator) is [[0 (number)|zero]]. Such a division can be formally [[expression (mathematics)|expressed]] as ''a''/0 where ''a'' is the dividend (numerator). In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has no meaning, as there is no number which, multiplied by 0, gives ''a'' (assuming ''a''≠0), and so division by zero is [[undefined (mathematics)|undefined]]. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the expression 0/0 is also undefined; when it is the form of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], it is an [[indeterminate form]]. Historically, one of the earliest recorded references to the mathematical impossibility of assigning a value to ''a''/0 is contained in [[George Berkeley]]'s criticism of [[infinitesimal calculus]] in 1734 in ''[[The Analyst]]'' ("ghosts of departed quantities").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

There are mathematical structures in which ''a''/0 is defined for some ''a'' such as in the [[Riemann sphere]] and the [[projectively extended real line]]; however, such structures cannot satisfy every ordinary rule of arithmetic (the [[Field mathematics#Definition and illustration|field axioms]]).

In [[Computer|computing]], a [[computer programming|program error]] may result from an attempt to divide by zero. Depending on the programming environment and the type of number (e.g. [[floating point]], [[integer]]) being divided by zero, it may generate [[Extended real number line|positive or negative infinity]] by the [[IEEE 754]] floating point standard, generate an [[exception handling|exception]], generate an [[error message]], cause the program to terminate, result in a special [[NaN|not-a-number]] value, a [[Hang (computing)|freeze]] via infinite [[Loop (computing)|loop]], or a [[Crash (computing)|crash]].

==Elementary arithmetic==
When division is explained at the [[elementary arithmetic]] level, it is often considered as splitting a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of objects into equal parts. As an example, consider having ten cookies, and these cookies are to be distributed equally to five people at a table. Each person would receive &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{10}{5}&lt;/math&gt; = 2 cookies. Similarly, if there are ten cookies, and only one person at the table, that person would receive &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{10}{1}&lt;/math&gt; = 10 cookies.

So, for dividing by zero, what is the number of cookies that each person receives when 10 cookies are evenly distributed amongst 0 people at a table? Certain words can be pinpointed in the question to highlight the problem. The problem with this question is the "when". There is no way to evenly distribute 10 cookies to nobody. In [[mathematical jargon]], a set of 10 items cannot be [[Partition of a set|partitioned]] into 0 subsets. So &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{10}{0}&lt;/math&gt;, at least in elementary arithmetic, is said to be either meaningless, or undefined.

Similar problems occur if one has 0 cookies and 0 people, but this time the problem is in the phrase "'''the''' number". A partition is possible (of a set with 0 elements into 0 parts), but since the partition has 0 parts, [[Vacuous truth|vacuously]] every set in our partition has a given number of elements, be it 0, 2, 5, or 1000.

If there are, say, 5 cookies and 2 people, the problem is in "evenly distribute". In any integer partition of a 5-set into 2 parts, one of the parts of the partition will have more elements than the other. But the problem with 5 cookies and 2 people can be solved by cutting one cookie in half. The problem with 5 cookies and 0 people cannot be solved in any way that preserves the meaning of "divides".

Another way of looking at division by zero is that division can always be checked using multiplication. Considering the 10/0 example above, setting x = 10/0, if ''x'' equals ten divided by zero, then ''x'' times zero equals ten, but there is no ''x'' that, when multiplied by zero, gives ten (or any other number than zero). If instead of x=10/0 we have x=0/0, then every ''x'' satisfies the question 'what number x, multiplied by zero, gives zero?'

==Early attempts==
The ''[[Brahmasphutasiddhanta]]'' of [[Brahmagupta]] (598–668) is the earliest known text to treat [[0 (number)|zero]] as a number in its own right and to define operations involving zero.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Robert |title=The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999 |location=New York |pages=68–75 |isbn=0-19-514237-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author could not explain division by zero in his texts: his definition can be easily proven to lead to algebraic absurdities. According to Brahmagupta,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator. Zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator. Zero divided by zero is zero.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 830, [[Mahavira (mathematician)|Mahavira]] tried unsuccessfully to correct Brahmagupta's mistake in his book in ''Ganita Sara Samgraha'': "A number remains unchanged when divided by zero."&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;

==Algebra==

The four basic operations − addition, subtraction, multiplication and division − as applied to whole numbers (positive integers), with some restrictions, in elementary arithmetic are used as a framework to support the extension of the realm of numbers to which they apply. For instance, to make it possible to subtract any whole number from another, the realm of numbers must be expanded to the entire set of [[integers]] in order to incorporate the negative integers. Similarly, to support division of any integer by any other, the realm of numbers must expand to the [[rational numbers]]. During this gradual expansion of the number system, care is taken to ensure that the "extended operations", when applied to the older numbers, do not produce different results. Loosely speaking, since division by zero has no meaning (is ''undefined'') in the whole number setting, this remains true as the setting expands to the [[real number|real]] or even [[complex numbers]].

As the realm of numbers to which these operations can be applied expands there are also changes in how the operations are viewed. For instance, in the realm of integers, subtraction is no longer considered a basic operation since it can be replaced by addition of signed numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Klein|1925|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when the realm of numbers expands to include the rational numbers, division is replaced by multiplication by certain rational numbers. In keeping with this change of viewpoint, the question, "Why can't we divide by zero?", becomes "Why can't a rational number have a zero denominator?". Answering this revised question precisely requires close examination of the definition of rational numbers.

In the modern approach to constructing the field of real numbers, the rational numbers appear as an intermediate step in the development that is founded on set theory. First, the natural numbers (including zero) are established on an axiomatic basis such as [[Peano axioms|Peano's axiom system]] and then this is expanded to the [[ring of integers]]. The next step is to define the rational numbers keeping in mind that this must be done using only the sets and operations that have already been established, namely, addition, multiplication and the integers. Starting with the set of [[ordered pair]]s of integers, {{math|{(''a'', ''b'')}}} with {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}}, define a [[binary relation]] on this set by {{math|(''a'', ''b'') ≃ (''c'', ''d'')}} if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. This relation is shown to be an [[equivalence relation]] and its [[equivalence class]]es are then defined to be the rational numbers. It is in the formal proof that this relation is an equivalence relation that the requirement that the second coordinate is not zero is needed (for verifying [[Transitive relation|transitivity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schumacher|1996|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamilton|1982|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Henkin|Smith|Varineau|Walsh|2012|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above explanation may be too abstract and technical for many purposes, but if one assumes the existence and properties of the rational numbers, as is commonly done in elementary mathematics, the "reason" that division by zero is not allowed is hidden from view. Nevertheless, a (non-rigorous) justification can be given in this setting.

It follows from the properties of the number system we are using (that is, integers, rationals, reals, etc.), if {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}} then the equation&lt;ref&gt;if {{math|1=''b'' = 0}} this is not an equation since the left side is not a number and the right side is a number.&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|1={{sfrac|''a''|''b''}} = ''c''}} is equivalent to {{math|1= ''a'' = ''b'' × ''c''}}. Assuming that {{math|{{sfrac|''a''|0}}}} is a number {{mvar|c}}, then it must be that {{math|1=''a'' = 0 × ''c'' = 0}}. However, the single number {{mvar|c}} would then have to be determined by the equation {{math|1= 0 = 0 × ''c''}}, but every number satisfies this equation, so we cannot assign a numerical value to {{math|{{sfrac|0|0}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bunch|1997|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division as the inverse of multiplication===
The concept that explains [[Division (mathematics)|division]] in algebra is that it is the inverse of multiplication. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=E-Z Math |edition=revised |first1=Anthony |last1=Prindle |first2=Katie |last2=Prindle |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7641-4132-4 |page=35 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zQIrGLwkQkC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3zQIrGLwkQkC&amp;pg=PA35 Extract of page 35]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{3}=2&lt;/math&gt;
since 2 is the value for which the unknown quantity in
:&lt;math&gt;?\times 3=6&lt;/math&gt;
is true. But the expression
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{6}{0}=\,x&lt;/math&gt;
requires a value to be found for the unknown quantity in
:&lt;math&gt;x\times 0=6.&lt;/math&gt;
But any number multiplied by 0 is 0 and so there is no number that solves the equation.

The expression
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{0}{0}=\,x&lt;/math&gt;
requires a value to be found for the unknown quantity in
:&lt;math&gt;x\times 0=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Again, any number multiplied by 0 is 0 and so this time every number solves the equation instead of there being a single number that can be taken as the value of 0/0.

In general, a single value can't be assigned to a fraction where the denominator is 0 so the value remains undefined.

===Fallacies===
{{details|Mathematical fallacy}}
A compelling reason for not allowing division by zero is that, if it were allowed, many absurd results (i.e., [[fallacy|fallacies]]) would arise. When working with numerical quantities it is easy to determine when an illegal attempt to divide by zero is being made. For example, consider the following computation.

With the following assumptions:

:&lt;math&gt;0\times 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0\times 2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The following must be true:

:&lt;math&gt;0\times 1 = 0\times 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing by zero gives:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{0}{0}\times 1 = \frac{0}{0}\times 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Simplified, this yields:

:&lt;math&gt;1 = 2.&lt;/math&gt;

The fallacy here is the assumption that dividing by 0 is a legitimate operation with the same properties as dividing by any other number.

However, it is possible to disguise a division by zero in an [[algebra]]ic argument,&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt; leading to [[invalid proof]]s that, for instance, {{math|1=1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2}} such as the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bunch|1997|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Let {{math|1= 1 = ''x''}}.
:Multiply by {{mvar|x}} to get
::&lt;math&gt;x = x^2.&lt;/math&gt; 
:Subtract {{math|1}} from each side to get
::&lt;math&gt;x - 1 = x^2 - 1.&lt;/math&gt;
:Divide both sides by {{math|''x'' - 1}}
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{x-1}{x-1} = \frac{x^2 -1}{x - 1}.&lt;/math&gt;
:Which simplifies to
::&lt;math&gt;1 = x + 1.&lt;/math&gt;
:But, since {{math|1=''x'' = 1}},
::  &lt;math&gt;1 = 1 + 1 = 2.&lt;/math&gt;
The disguised division by zero occurs since {{math|''x'' − 1}} is zero when {{math|1=''x'' = 1}}.

==Calculus==
===Extended real line===
{{see also|l'Hôpital's rule}}

At first glance it seems possible to define ''a''/0 by considering the [[limit of a function|limit]] of ''a''/''b'' as ''b'' approaches 0.

For any positive ''a'', the limit from the right is

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to 0^+} {a \over b} = +\infty&lt;/math&gt;

however, the limit from the left is

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to 0^-} {a \over b} = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;

and so the &lt;math&gt;\lim_{b \to 0} {a \over b}&lt;/math&gt; is undefined (the limit is also undefined for negative ''a'').

Furthermore, there is no obvious definition of 0/0 that can be derived from considering the limit of a ratio. The limit

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{(a,b) \to (0,0)} {a \over b} &lt;/math&gt;

does not exist. Limits of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 0} {f(x) \over g(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

in which both ''ƒ''(''x'') and ''g''(''x'') approach 0 as ''x'' approaches 0, may equal any real or infinite value, or may not exist at all, depending on the particular functions ''ƒ'' and ''g''. These and other similar facts show that the expression 0/0 cannot be [[well-defined]] as a limit.

====Formal operations====
A [[formal calculation]] is one carried out using rules of arithmetic, without consideration of whether the result of the calculation is well-defined. Thus, it is sometimes useful to think of ''a''/0, where ''a''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0, as being &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. This infinity can be either positive, negative, or unsigned, depending on context. For example, formally:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits_{x \to 0} {\frac{1}{x} =\frac{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} {1}}{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} {x}}} = \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

As with any formal calculation, invalid results may be obtained. A logically rigorous (as opposed to formal) computation would assert only that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim\limits_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = +\infty\text{ and }\lim\limits_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x} = -\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the [[one-sided limit]]s are different, the two-sided limit does not exist in the standard framework of the real numbers. Also, the fraction 1/0 is left [[Defined and undefined|undefined]] in the [[extended real line]], therefore it and

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} 1 }{\lim\limits_{x \to 0} x}&lt;/math&gt;

are meaningless [[Expression (mathematics)|expressions]].

===Projectively extended real line===
The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[projectively extended real line]], which is a [[one-point compactification]] of the real line. Here &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; means an [[point at infinity|unsigned infinity]], an infinite quantity that is neither positive nor negative. This quantity satisfies &lt;math&gt;-\infty = \infty&lt;/math&gt;, which is necessary in this context. In this structure, &lt;math&gt;a/0 = \infty&lt;/math&gt; can be defined for nonzero ''a'', and &lt;math&gt;a/\infty = 0&lt;/math&gt;. It is the natural way to view the range of the [[tangent]] function and cotangent functions of [[trigonometry]]: tan(''x'') approaches the single point at infinity as ''x'' approaches either &lt;math&gt;+\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;-\pi/2&lt;/math&gt; from either direction.

This definition leads to many interesting results. However, the resulting algebraic structure is not a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], and should not be expected to behave like one. For example, &lt;math&gt;\infty + \infty&lt;/math&gt; is undefined in this extension of the real line.

===Riemann sphere===
The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann sphere]], which is of major importance in [[complex analysis]]. Here too &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; is an unsigned infinity – or, as it is often called in this context, the [[point at infinity]]. This set is analogous to the projectively extended real line, except that it is based on the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[complex number]]s. In the Riemann sphere, &lt;math&gt;1/0=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;0/0&lt;/math&gt; is undefined, as is &lt;math&gt;0\times\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

===Extended non-negative real number line===
{{unsourced|subsection|date=October 2018}}
The negative real numbers can be discarded, and infinity introduced, leading to the set [0,&amp;nbsp;∞], where division by zero can be naturally defined as ''a''/0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞ for positive&amp;nbsp;''a''. While this makes division defined in more cases than usual, subtraction is instead left undefined in many cases, because there are no negative numbers.

==Higher mathematics==
Although division by zero cannot be sensibly defined with real numbers and integers, it is possible to consistently define it, or similar operations, in other mathematical structures.

===Non-standard analysis===
In the [[hyperreal number]]s and the [[surreal number]]s, division by zero is still impossible, but division by non-zero [[infinitesimal]]s is possible.

===Distribution theory===
In [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]] one can extend the function &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; to a distribution on the whole space of real numbers (in effect by using [[Cauchy principal value]]s). It does not, however, make sense to ask for a 'value' of this distribution at ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0; a sophisticated answer refers to the [[singular support]] of the distribution.

===Linear algebra===
In [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebra (or [[linear algebra]] in general), one can define a pseudo-division, by setting ''a''/''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ab''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, in which ''b''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; represents the [[Moore–Penrose inverse|pseudoinverse]] of ''b''. It can be proven that if ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; exists, then ''b''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. If ''b'' equals 0, then b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.

===Abstract algebra===
Any number system that forms a [[commutative ring]]—for instance, the integers, the real numbers, and the complex numbers—can be extended to a [[wheel theory|wheel]] in which division by zero is always possible; however, in such a case, "division" has a slightly different meaning.

The concepts applied to standard arithmetic are similar to those in more general algebraic structures, such as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. In a field, every nonzero element is invertible under multiplication; as above, division poses problems only when attempting to divide by zero. This is likewise true in a [[skew field]] (which for this reason is called a [[division ring]]). However, in other rings, division by nonzero elements may also pose problems. For example, the ring '''Z'''/6'''Z''' of integers mod 6. The meaning of the expression &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; should be the solution ''x'' of the equation &lt;math&gt;2x = 2&lt;/math&gt;. But in the ring '''Z'''/6'''Z''', 2 is a [[zero divisor]]. This equation has two distinct solutions, ''x'' = 1 and ''x'' = 4, so the expression &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Defined and undefined|undefined]].

In field theory, the expression &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt; is only shorthand for the formal expression ''ab''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is the multiplicative inverse of ''b''. Since the field axioms only guarantee the existence of such inverses for nonzero elements, this expression has no meaning when ''b'' is zero. Modern texts, that define fields as a special type of ring, include the axiom 0&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;1 for fields (or its equivalent) so that the [[zero ring]] is excluded from being a field. In the zero ring, division by zero is possible, which shows that the other field axioms are not sufficient to exclude division by zero in a field.

==Computer arithmetic==
[[File:TI86 Calculator DivByZero.jpg|thumb|Most calculators, such as this [[Texas Instruments]] [[TI-86]], will halt execution and display an error message when the user or a running program attempts to divide by zero.]]
[[File:Division by zero on android 2.2.1 calculator.png|thumb|196px|x294px|Division by zero on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 2.2.1 calculator shows the symbol of infinity.]]
The [[IEEE floating-point standard]], supported by almost all modern [[floating-point unit]]s, specifies that every [[floating point]] arithmetic operation, including division by zero, has a well-defined result. The standard supports [[signed zero]], as well as [[infinity]] and [[NaN]] (''not a number''). There are two zeroes: +0 (''positive zero'') and −0 (''negative zero'') and this removes any ambiguity when dividing. In [[IEEE 754]] arithmetic, ''a''&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;+0 is positive infinity when ''a'' is positive, negative infinity when ''a'' is negative, and NaN when ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;±0. The infinity signs change when dividing by [[−0 (number)|−0]] instead.

The justification for this definition is to preserve the sign of the result in case of [[arithmetic underflow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cody|first=W.J.|title=Analysis of Proposals for the Floating-Point Standard|journal=Computer|date=March 1981|volume=14|issue=3|pages=65|doi=10.1109/C-M.1981.220379|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1667286|accessdate=11 September 2012|quote=With appropriate care to be certain that the algebraic signs are not determined by rounding error, the affine mode preserves order relations while fixing up overflow. Thus, for example, the reciprocal of a negative number which underflows is still negative.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the single-precision computation 1/(''x''/2), where ''x'' = ±2&lt;sup&gt;−149&lt;/sup&gt;, the computation ''x''/2 underflows and produces ±0 with sign matching ''x'', and the result will be ±∞ with sign matching ''x''. The sign will match that of the exact result ±2&lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;, but the magnitude of the exact result is too large to represent, so infinity is used to indicate overflow.

Integer division by zero is usually handled differently from floating point since there is no integer representation for the result. Some processors generate an [[exception handling|exception]] when an attempt is made to divide an integer by zero, although others will simply continue and generate an incorrect result for the division. The result depends on how division is implemented, and can either be zero, or sometimes the largest possible integer.

Because of the improper algebraic results of assigning any value to division by zero, many computer [[programming language]]s (including those used by [[calculator]]s) explicitly forbid the execution of the operation and may prematurely halt a program that attempts it, sometimes reporting a "Divide by zero" error. In these cases, if some special behavior is desired for division by zero, the condition must be explicitly tested (for example, using an [[if statement]]). Some programs (especially those that use [[fixed-point arithmetic]] where no dedicated floating-point hardware is available) will use behavior similar to the IEEE standard, using large positive and negative numbers to approximate infinities. In some programming languages, an attempt to divide by zero results in [[undefined behavior]]. The graphical programming language [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch 2]] used in many schools returns Infinity or -Infinity depending on the sign of the dividend.

In [[two's complement]] arithmetic, attempts to divide the smallest signed integer by &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; are attended by similar problems, and are handled with the same range of solutions, from explicit error conditions to [[undefined behavior]].

Most calculators will either return an error or state that 1/0 is undefined; however, some [[Texas Instruments|TI]] and [[Hewlett Packard|HP]] graphing calculators will evaluate (1/0)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to ∞.

[[Microsoft Math]] and [[Mathematica]] return ''ComplexInfinity'' for 1/0. [[Maple (software)|Maple]] and [[SageMath]] return an error message for 1/0, and infinity for 1/0.0 (0.0 tells these systems to use floating point arithmetic instead of algebraic arithmetic).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15238">'''Executable UML''' ('''xtUML''' or '''xUML''') is both a software development method and a highly abstract software language. It was described for the first time in 2002 in the book "Executable UML: A Foundation for Model-Driven Architecture"&lt;ref&gt;Mellor and Balcer 2002&lt;/ref&gt;. The language "combines a subset of the UML ([[Unified Modeling Language]]) graphical notation with executable semantics and timing rules."&lt;ref&gt;Starr 2002, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Executable UML method is the successor to the [[Shlaer–Mellor method]].&lt;ref&gt;G. O'Keefe (2006) "Dynamic Logic Semantics for UML Consistency" in: ''Model-Driven Architecture - Foundations and Applications: Second European Conference, ECMDA-FA 2006, Bilbao, Spain, July 10–13, 2006, Proceedings''. Arend Rensink eds. p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Executable UML models "can be run, [[software testing|tested]], debugged, and measured for performance.",&lt;ref&gt;Starr 2002, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and can be [[compiler|compiled]] into a less abstract [[programming language]] to target a specific [[implementation]].&lt;ref&gt;Mellor and Balcer 2002, section 1.4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Executable UML supports [[model-driven architecture]] (MDA) through specification of [[platform-independent model]]s, and the [[Compiler|compilation]] of the [[platform-independent model]]s into [[platform-specific model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor and Balcer 2002, section 1.5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raistrick et al. 2004, sections 2.3.3 and 2.3.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Executable UML is a higher level of [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] than [[third-generation programming language]]s. This allows [[software developer|developer]]s to develop at the level of abstraction of the application.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor and Balcer 2002, section 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The Executable UML aims for [[separation of concerns]]. This is supposed to increase ease of [[code reuse|reuse]] and to lower the cost of [[software development]]. This also enables Executable UML domains to be [[cross-platform]]. That means it is not tied to any specific programming language, platform or technology.

Executable UML also allows for translation of [[platform-independent model]]s (PIM) into [[platform-specific model]]s (PSM). The Executable UML method enables valuing the model as [[intellectual property]], since the model is a fully executable solution for the problem space.

Actions are specified in [[action (UML)|action language]]. This means that the automatic generation of implementation code from Executable UML models can be output in an optimized form.

Executable UML is intended to serve as executable code as well as documentation. The models are a graphical, executable specification of the problem space that is compiled into a target [[implementation]]. They are also intended to be [[human-readable]].

== Executable UML building blocks ==
A [[application software|system]] is composed of multiple subject matters, known as ''domains'' in Executable UML terms. Executable UML is used to model a domain at the level of [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] of its subject matter independent of implementation concerns. The resulting domain model is represented by the following elements:
* The ''domain chart'' provides a view of the [[aspect (computer programming)|domain]] being modeled, and the dependencies it has on other domains.
* The ''class diagram'' defines the [[class (computer programming)|class]]es and class [[association (object-oriented programming)|association]]s for the domain.
* The ''statechart diagram'' defines the [[finite-state machine|state]]s, events, and state transitions for a class or class instance.
* The ''action language'' defines the actions or operations that perform processing on model elements.

===Domain Chart===
Executable UML requires identification of the domains (also known as: [[aspect (computer programming)|aspect]]s&lt;ref&gt;Mellor and Balcer 2002, section 3.4.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[concern (computer science)|concern]]s) of the system.  "Each domain is an autonomous world inhabited by conceptual entities"&lt;ref&gt;Mellor and Balcer 2002, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Each domain can be modeled independent of the other domains in the system, enabling a [[separation of concerns]].  As an example, domains for an automated teller system may include the following:
* The application domain model of the automated teller's [[business logic]].
* The [[computer security|security]] domain model of various issues regarding system security (such as [[authentication]] and [[encryption]]).
* The data access domain model of methods for external [[data (computing)|data]] usage.
* The [[data logging|logging]] domain model of the various methods through which the system can or must log information.
* The [[user interface]] domain model of the user interactions with the system.
* The [[computing platform|architecture]] domain model of the [[implementation|implemented]] of the Executable UML model on the system's [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] platforms.

The ''separation of concerns'' enables each domain to be developed and verified independently of the other domains in the system by the respective domain experts.

The connections between domains are called ''bridges''.  "A bridge is a layering dependency between domains".&lt;ref&gt;Mellor and Balcer 2002, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the domains can place requirements upon other domains. It is recommended that bridges are agreed upon by the different domain experts.

A domain can be marked as ''realized'' to indicate that the domain exists and does not need to be modeled. For example, a data access domain that uses a [[MySQL]] database would be marked as realized.

===Class diagram===
{{See also|Class diagram}}
Conceptual entities, such as tangible things, roles, incidents, interactions, and specifications, specific to the domain being modeled are abstracted into ''classes''. Classes can have ''attributes'' and ''operations''.

The relationships between these classes will be indicated with ''associations'' and ''generalizations''. An association may require further abstraction as an ''Association Class''.

Constraints on the class diagram can be written in both Action Language and [[Object Constraint Language]] (OCL).

The Executable UML method limits the UML elements that can be used in an Executable UML class diagram.

An Executable UML class diagram is meant to expose information about the domain. Too much complexity in the statechart diagrams is a good indicator that the class diagram should be reworked.

===Statechart Diagram===
{{See also|Finite-state machine|State diagram}}
Classes have lifecycles which are modeled in Executable UML with a [[state diagram|statechart diagram]].  The statechart diagram defines the ''states'', ''transitions'', ''events'', and ''procedures'' that define a class' behaviour.

Each state has only one procedure that is executed upon [[Moore machine|entry into that state]]. A procedure is composed of actions, which are specified in an action language.

===Action Language===
The class and state models by themselves can only provide a static view of the domain. In order to have an executable model, there must be a way to create class instances, establish associations, perform operations on attributes, call state events, etc. In Executable UML, this is done using an action language that conforms to the UML Action Semantics.

Action Semantics was added to the UML specification in 2001. The Action Semantics RFP was based on previous work in action languages supporting the [[Shlaer–Mellor method]]. Existing action languages are Object Action Language (OAL), Shlaer–Mellor Action Language (SMALL), Action Specification Language (ASL), That Action Language (TALL), Starr's Concise Relational Action Language (SCRALL), Platform-independent Action Language (PAL) and PathMATE Action Language (PAL). SCRALL is the only one that is a graphical action language.

===Model testing and execution===
Once a domain is modeled, it can be [[software testing|tested]] independent of the target [[implementation]] by executing the model.  Each domain can be [[verification and validation|verified and validated]] independent of any other domain. This allows [[software bug|error]]s detected to be associated with the domain and independent of other system concerns.

[[static testing|Verification]] will involve such things as human [[peer review|review]] of the models, performed by experts in the relevant domain, and automated checking of the Executable UML semantics. i.e., checking that the Executable UML model complies with the Executable UML [[meta]]model.

[[dynamic testing|Validation]] will typically involve use of an Executable UML tool to execute the model. The execution can occur either before or after model compilation.

===Model compilation===
In order to support execution on the target [[implementation]], the domain model must be translated into a less [[abstraction (computer science)|abstract]] form. This translation process is called ''model compilation''. Most model [[compilation (programming)|compiler]]s target a known [[programming language]], because this allows reuse of existing [[compiler]] technologies.

[[Program optimization|Optimizing]] the domain models for target [[implementation]] reasons will reduce the level of [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], adversely affect domain independence, and increase the cost of [[code reuse|reuse]]. In executable UML, [[optimization (computer science)|optimization]]s are done by the model [[compilation (programming)|compiler]] either automatically or through ''marking''. Marking allows specific model elements to be targeted for specific lower-level [[implementation]]s, and allows for broader architectural decisions, such as specifying that [[container (abstract data type)|collection]]s of objects should be [[implementation|implemented]] as a [[doubly linked list]].

In [[model-driven architecture|MDA]] terms, the model [[compilation (programming)|compiler]] creates the [[platform-specific model|PSM]]. The separation between the [[platform-independent model|PIM]] and [[platform-specific model|PSM]] in Executable UML disables the ability to [[Round-trip engineering|round-trip engineer]] the model, and deters modifications to the [[platform-specific model|PSM]].&lt;ref&gt;Mellor and Balcer 2002, chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executable UML Key Aspects==
Executable UML defines execution semantics for a subset of the UML. Key aspects of the Executable UML subset include the following:
* No support for implementation specific constructs, like aggregation and composition.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor and Balcer 2002, p. xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Generalizations are always notated as {complete, disjoint}.
* Associations between classes are ''always'' named, have verb phrases on both ends specifying the roles, and have multiplicity specified on both ends.
* Multiplicities on association ends are restricted to 0..1 (zero to one), * (zero to many), 1 (exactly one), or 1..* (one to many).
* [[Data type]]s are restricted to the following core data types: boolean, string, integer, real, date, timestamp, and arbitrary_id, or one of the following domain-specific data types: numeric, string, enumerated, and composite. Domain-specific numeric and string data types can represent subsets of the core data types. The domain-specific composite data type is to always be treated as a single unit within the domain. e.g., a ''MailingAddress'' composite data type could be declared, but city information couldn't be extracted from it.
* [[Constraint (information theory)|Constraint]]s on the Executable UML models can either be represented as [[Object Constraint Language]] (OCL) or action language.

== fUML and ALF ==
The [[Object Management Group]] has standardized the [[fUML|Foundational UML (fUML)]], which was strongly influenced by Executable UML.

Action Language for Foundational UML (ALF),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/ALF/|title=Action Language for Foundational UML™ (ALF™)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.omg.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a standard action language specification by the [[Object Management Group]].

In mathematics ([[linear algebra]]), the '''Faddeev–LeVerrier algorithm''' is a [[Recurrence relation|recursive]] method to calculate the coefficients of the  [[characteristic polynomial]] &lt;math&gt;p(\lambda)=\det (\lambda I_n - A)&lt;/math&gt; of a  square [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], {{mvar|A}}, named after  [[Dmitry Konstantinovich Faddeev]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]]. Calculation of this polynomial yields the  [[eigenvalue]]s  of {{mvar|A}} as its roots; as a matrix polynomial in  the matrix {{mvar|A}} itself, it vanishes by the fundamental [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]]. Calculating determinants, however, is computationally cumbersome, whereas this efficient algorithm is computationally significantly more efficient (in [[NC (complexity)|NC complexity class]]).

The algorithm has been independently rediscovered several times, in some form or another. It was first published in 1840 by  [[Urbain Le Verrier]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Urbain Le Verrier]]: ''Sur les variations séculaires des éléments des orbites pour les sept planètes principales'', ''J. de Math.'' (1) '''5''', 230 (1840), [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k163849/f228n35.capture# Online]&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently redeveloped by

::&lt;math&gt;p(\lambda)\equiv \det(\lambda I_n-A)=\sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k \lambda^k~,&lt;/math&gt;
where, evidently,  {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} = 1 and  {{math|''c''}}&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; det {{mvar|A}}.

The coefficients are determined recursively from the top down, by dint of the auxiliary matrices {{mvar|M}}, 
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
M_0 &amp;\equiv 0      &amp; c_n &amp;= 1                                                               \qquad &amp;(k=0) \\
M_k &amp;\equiv AM_{k-1} + c_{n-k+1} I \qquad \qquad  &amp; c_{n-k} &amp;= -\frac 1 k \mathrm{tr}(AM_k) \qquad &amp;k=1,\ldots ,n   ~.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, 
:&lt;math&gt;                                                             
M_1=   I ~, \quad   c_{n-1} = - \mathrm{tr} A =-c_n  \mathrm{tr} A ; &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_2=   A-I\mathrm{tr} A , \quad c_{n-2}=-\frac{1}{2}\Bigl(\mathrm{tr} A^2 -(\mathrm{tr} A)^2\Bigr) =
-\frac{1}{2} (c_n  \mathrm{tr} A^2 +c_{n-1} \mathrm{tr} A) ; 
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_3=   A^2-A\mathrm{tr} A -\frac{1}{2}\Bigl(\mathrm{tr} A^2 -(\mathrm{tr} A)^2\Bigr)  I,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;c_{n-3}=- \tfrac{1}{6}\Bigl( (\operatorname{tr}A)^3-3\operatorname{tr}(A^2)(\operatorname{tr}A)+2\operatorname{tr}(A^3)\Bigr)=-\frac{1}{3}(c_n  \mathrm{tr} A^3+c_{n-1} \mathrm{tr} A^2 +c_{n-2}\mathrm{tr} A); &lt;/math&gt;

&amp;nbsp;  ...; 
:&lt;math&gt;M_m= \sum_{k=1}^{m} c_{n-m+k}  A^{k-1}   ~,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_{n-m}= -\frac{1}{m}(c_n  \mathrm{tr} A^m+c_{n-1} \mathrm{tr} A^{m-1}+...+c_{n-m+1}\mathrm{tr} A)= -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{k=1}^{m} c_{n-m+k}  \mathrm{tr} A^k   ~  ;  ...&lt;/math&gt;

Observe {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} − M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; /c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} (−1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''/det''A''}} terminates the recursion at {{mvar| λ}}.  This could be used to obtain the inverse or the determinant of {{mvar|A}}.

==Derivation==
The proof  relies on the modes of the [[adjugate matrix]], {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ M&lt;sub&gt;n−k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the auxiliary matrices encountered.  &amp;nbsp; 
This matrix is defined by 
::&lt;math&gt;(\lambda I-A) B = I ~ p(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; 
and is thus proportional to the [[Resolvent formalism|resolvent]] 
:&lt;math&gt;B =   p(\lambda) \frac{I}{\lambda I-A } ~. &lt;/math&gt;

It is evidently a matrix polynomial in {{math|''λ''}} of degree {{math|''n−1''}}. Thus,
::&lt;math&gt;B\equiv \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}  \lambda^k~ B_k=  \sum_{k=0}^{n}  \lambda^k~ M_{n-k}  ,&lt;/math&gt;
where one may define the harmless {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}≡0.

Inserting the explicit polynomial forms into the defining equation for the adjugate, above, 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{n}  \lambda^{k+1} M_{n-k} - \lambda^k (AM_{n-k} +c_k I)=  0~.&lt;/math&gt;

Now, at the highest order, the first term vanishes by {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}=0; whereas  at the bottom order (constant in  {{mvar|λ}}, from the defining equation of the adjugate, above),
:&lt;math&gt;M_n A= B_0 A=c_0~,&lt;/math&gt; 
so that shifting the dummy indices of the first term yields 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n}  \lambda^{k} \Big ( M_{1+n-k} - AM_{n-k} +c_k I\Big )=  0~,&lt;/math&gt;
which thus dictates the recursion
:&lt;math&gt;\therefore   \qquad M_{m} =A M_{m-1} +c_{n-m+1} I ~,&lt;/math&gt;
for {{mvar|m}}=1,...,{{mvar|n}}. Note that ascending index amounts to descending in powers of {{mvar|λ}}, but the polynomial coefficients {{mvar|c}} are yet to be determined in terms of the {{mvar|M}}s and {{mvar|A}}.

This can be easiest achieved through the following auxiliary equation (Hou, 1998),
::&lt;math&gt;\lambda \frac{\partial p(\lambda) }{ \partial \lambda} -n p =\operatorname{tr} AB~.&lt;/math&gt; 
This is but the trace of the defining equation for  {{mvar|B}} by dint of  [[Jacobi's formula]],
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p(\lambda)}{\partial \lambda}= p(\lambda) \sum^\infty _{m=0}\lambda ^{-(m+1)}  \operatorname{tr}A^m =  
p(\lambda) ~  \operatorname{tr} \frac{I}{\lambda I -A}\equiv\operatorname{tr} B~. &lt;/math&gt;

Inserting the polynomial mode forms in this auxiliary equation yields
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n}  \lambda^{k} \Big ( k c_k - n c_k - \operatorname{tr}A M_{n-k}\Big )=  0~,&lt;/math&gt;
so that 
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=1}^{n-1}  \lambda^{n-m} \Big ( m c_{n-m}  + \operatorname{tr}A M_{m}\Big )=  0~,&lt;/math&gt;
and finally 
:&lt;math&gt;\therefore  \qquad c_{n-m} = -\frac{1}{m} \operatorname{tr}A M_{m}  ~.&lt;/math&gt;
This completes the recursion of the previous section, unfolding in descending powers of {{mvar|λ}}.

Further note in the algorithm that, more directly, 
:&lt;math&gt; M_{m} =A M_{m-1} - \frac{1}{m-1} (\operatorname{tr}A M_{m-1}) I   ~,&lt;/math&gt;
and, in comportance with the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]],
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{adj}(A) =(-)^{n-1} M_{n}=(-)^{n-1} (A^{n-1}+c_{n-1}A^{n-2}+ ...+c_2 A+ c_1 I)=(-)^{n-1}   \sum_{k=1}^n  c_k A^{k-1}~.&lt;/math&gt;



The final solution might be more conveniently expressed in terms of complete exponential [[Bell polynomials]] as 
:&lt;math&gt; c_{n-k} = \frac{(-1)^{n-k}}{k!} {\mathcal B}_k \Bigl ( \operatorname{tr}A , -1! ~  \operatorname{tr}A^2, 2! ~\operatorname{tr}A^3, \ldots, (-1)^{k-1}(k-1)! ~ \operatorname{tr}A^k\Bigr ) .&lt;/math&gt;

==Example==
:&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle A=\left[{\begin{array}{rrr}3&amp;1&amp;5\\3&amp;3&amp;1\\4&amp;6&amp;4\end{array}}\right]}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}M_{0}&amp;=\left[{\begin{array}{rrr}0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0\end{array}}\right]\quad &amp;&amp;&amp;c_{3}&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;=&amp;1\\M_{\mathbf {\color {blue}1} }&amp;=\left[{\begin{array}{rrr}1&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;1&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;1\end{array}}\right] &amp;A~M_{1}&amp;=\left[{\begin{array}{rrr}\mathbf {\color {red}3} &amp;1&amp;5\\3&amp;\mathbf {\color {red}3} &amp;1\\4&amp;6&amp;\mathbf {\color {red}4} \end{array}}\right]  &amp;c_{2}&amp;&amp;&amp;=-{\frac {1}{\mathbf {\color {blue}1} }} \mathbf {\color {red}10} &amp;&amp;=&amp;-10\\M_{\mathbf {\color {blue}2} }&amp;=\left[{\begin{array}{rrr}-7&amp;1&amp;5\\3&amp;-7&amp;1\\4&amp;6&amp;-6\end{array}}\right]\qquad &amp;A~M_{2}&amp;=\left[{\begin{array}{rrr}\mathbf {\color {red}2} &amp;26&amp;-14\\-8&amp;\mathbf {\color {red}-12} &amp;12\\6&amp;-14&amp;\mathbf {\color {red}2} \end{array}}\right]\qquad &amp;c_{1}&amp;&amp;&amp;=-{\frac {1}{\mathbf {\color {blue}2} }} \mathbf {\color {red}(-8)} &amp;&amp;=&amp;4\\M_{\mathbf {\color {blue}3} }&amp;=\left[{\begin{array}{rrr}6&amp;26&amp;-14\\-8&amp;-8&amp;12\\6&amp;-14&amp;6\end{array}}\right]\qquad &amp;A~M_{3}&amp;=\left[{\begin{array}{rrr}\mathbf {\color {red}40} &amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;\mathbf {\color {red}40} &amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;\mathbf {\color {red}40} \end{array}}\right]\qquad &amp;c_{0}&amp;&amp;&amp;=-{\frac {1}{\mathbf {\color {blue}3} }}\mathbf {\color {red}120} &amp;&amp;=&amp;-40\end{aligned}}}  &lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore,  &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle M_{4}=A~M_{3}+c_{0}~I=0}&lt;/math&gt;, which  confirms the  above calculations.

The characteristic polynomial of matrix {{mvar|A}} is thus &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle p_{A}(\lambda )=\lambda ^{3}-10\lambda ^{2}+4\lambda -40}&lt;/math&gt;; the determinant of {{mvar|A}} is &lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle \det(A)=(-1)^{3} c_{0}=40}&lt;/math&gt;; the trace is 10=−''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; and the inverse of {{mvar|A}} is 
:&lt;math&gt;{\displaystyle A^{-1}=-{\frac {1}{c_{0}}}~ M_{3}={\frac {1}{40}} \left[{\begin{array}{rrr}6&amp;26&amp;-14\\-8&amp;-8&amp;12\\6&amp;-14&amp;6\end{array}}\right]=\left[{\begin{array}{rrr}0{.}15&amp;0{.}65&amp;-0{.}35\\-0{.}20&amp;-0{.}20&amp;0{.}30\\0{.}15&amp;-0{.}35&amp;0{.}15\end{array}}\right]} &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4409">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''G''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-structure}}
In [[differential geometry]], a '''&lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;-structure''' is an important type of [[G-structure]] that can be defined on a [[smooth manifold]].  If ''M'' is a smooth manifold of dimension seven, then a G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-structure is a reduction of structure group of the [[frame bundle]] of ''M'' to the [[compact group|compact]], exceptional [[Lie group]] [[G2 (mathematics)|G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].

== Equivalent conditions ==
The condition of ''M '' admitting a &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; structure is equivalent to any of the following conditions:
*The first and second [[Stiefel–Whitney class]]es of ''M'' vanish.
*''M'' is [[orientable]] and admits a [[spin structure]].
The last condition above correctly suggests that many manifolds admit &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;-structures.

== History ==
A manifold with holonomy &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; was first introduced by [[Edmond Bonan]] in 1966, who constructed the parallel 3-form, the parallel 4-form and showed that this manifold was Ricci-flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first =| last = E. Bonan, | title = Sur les variétés riemanniennes à groupe d'holonomie G2 ou Spin(7)| journal = C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris | volume =262| year = 1966  | pages = 127&amp;ndash;129}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete, but noncompact 7-manifolds with holonomy &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; were constructed by [[Robert Bryant (mathematician)|Robert Bryant]] and Salamon in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Bryant | first = R.L. | first2 =  S.M. | last2 = Salamon | title = On the construction of some complete metrics with exceptional holonomy | journal = Duke Mathematical Journal | volume = 58 | year = 1989 | pages = 829&amp;ndash;850 | doi = 10.1215/s0012-7094-89-05839-0 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first compact 7-manifolds with holonomy &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; were constructed by [[Dominic Joyce]] in 1994, and compact &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt; manifolds are sometimes known as "Joyce manifolds", especially in the physics literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = D.D. | last = Joyce | title = Compact Manifolds with Special Holonomy | series = Oxford Mathematical Monographs | publisher = Oxford University Press |  isbn = 0-19-850601-5 | year = 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, it was shown by M. Firat Arikan, Hyunjoo Cho, and Sema Salur that any manifold with a [[spin structure]], and, hence, a &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;-structure, admits a compatible almost contact metric structure, and an explicit compatible almost contact structure was constructed for manifolds with &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;-structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = M. Firat | last = Arikan | first2 =  Hyunjoo | last2 = Cho | first3 =  Sema | last3 = Salur | title = Existence of compatible contact structures on &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;-manifolds | journal = Asian J. Math | issue = 2 | volume = 17 | year = 2013  | pages = 321&amp;ndash;334 | doi = 10.4310/AJM.2013.v17.n2.a3 | publisher = International Press of Boston| arxiv = 1112.2951 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same paper, it was shown that certain classes of [[G2 manifold|&lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;-manifolds]] admit a [[Contact geometry#Contact forms and structures|contact structure]].

== Remarks ==
The property of being a [[G2 manifold|&lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;-manifold]] is much stronger than that of admitting a &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;-structure.  Indeed, a &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;-manifold is a manifold with a &lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;-structure which is [[G-structure#Torsion of a G-structure|torsion-free]].

The letter "G" occurring in the phrases "G-structure" and "&lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;-structure" refers to different things.  In the first case, G-structures take their name from the fact that arbitrary Lie groups are typically denoted with the letter "G".  On the other hand, the letter "G" in "&lt;math&gt;G_2&lt;/math&gt;" comes from the fact that the its Lie algebra is the seventh type ("G" being the seventh letter of the alphabet) in the classification of complex simple Lie algebras by [[Élie Cartan]].

'''Gauss's lemma''' in [[number theory]] gives a condition for an integer to be a [[quadratic residue]]. Although it is not useful computationally, it has theoretical significance, being involved in some [[proofs of quadratic reciprocity]].

== Statement of the lemma ==
For any odd prime {{math|''p''}} let {{math|''a''}} be an integer that is [[coprime integers|coprime]] to {{math|''p''}}.

Consider the integers
:&lt;math&gt;a, 2a, 3a, \dots, \frac{p-1}{2}a&lt;/math&gt;
and their least positive residues modulo {{math|''p''}}. (These residues are all distinct, so there are ({{math|''p'' &amp;minus; 1)/2}} of them.)

Let {{math|''n''}} be the number of these residues that are greater than {{math|''p''/2}}. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{p}\right) = (-1)^n,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Legendre symbol]].

=== Example ===
Taking {{math|''p''}} = 11 and {{math|''a''}} = 7, the relevant sequence of integers is
: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35.
After reduction modulo 11, this sequence becomes
: 7, 3, 10, 6, 2.
Three of these integers are larger than 11/2 (namely 6, 7 and 10), so {{math|''n''}} = 3. Correspondingly Gauss's lemma predicts that
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac
{7}{11}\right) = (-1)^3 = -1.&lt;/math&gt;
This is indeed correct, because 7 is not a quadratic residue modulo 11.

The above sequence of residues
: 7, 3, 10, 6, 2
may also be written
: &amp;minus;4, 3, &amp;minus;1, &amp;minus;5, 2.
In this form, the integers larger than 11/2 appear as negative numbers. It is also apparent that the absolute values of the residues are a permutation of the residues
: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

== Proof ==
A fairly simple proof,&lt;ref name="Untersuchungen" /&gt;{{rp|458–462}} reminiscent of one of the simplest [[proofs of Fermat's little theorem]], can be obtained by evaluating the product
: &lt;math&gt;Z = a \cdot 2a \cdot 3a \cdot \cdots \cdot \frac{p-1}2 a&lt;/math&gt;
modulo ''p'' in two different ways. On one hand it is equal to
: &lt;math&gt;Z = a^{(p-1)/2} \left(1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cdots \cdot \frac{p-1}2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The second evaluation takes more work. If {{math|''x''}} is a nonzero residue modulo {{math|''p''}}, let us define the "absolute value" of {{math|''x''}} to be
: &lt;math&gt;|x| = \begin{cases} x &amp; \mbox{if } 1 \leq x \leq \frac{p-1}2, \\ p-x &amp; \mbox{if } \frac{p+1}2 \leq x \leq p-1. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
Since {{math|''n''}} counts those multiples {{math|''ka''}} which are in the latter range, and since for those multiples, {{math|&amp;minus;''ka''}} is in the first range, we have
: &lt;math&gt;Z = (-1)^n \left(|a| \cdot |2a| \cdot |3a| \cdot \cdots \cdots \left|\frac{p-1}2 a\right|\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Now observe that the values {{math|&amp;#124;''ra''&amp;#124;}} are ''distinct'' for {{math|''r'' &amp;#61; 1, 2, …, (''p'' &amp;minus; 1)/2}}. Indeed, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
|ra| &amp;\equiv |sa| &amp;\pmod{p} \\
ra &amp;\equiv \pm sa &amp;\pmod{p} \\
r &amp;\equiv \pm s &amp;\pmod{p}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
because {{math|''a''}} is coprime to {{math|''p''}}.

This gives {{math|''r''}} = {{math|''s''}}, since {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''s''}} are positive least residues. But there are exactly {{math|(''p'' &amp;minus; 1)/2}} of them, so their values are a rearrangement of the integers {{math|1, 2, …, (''p'' &amp;minus; 1)/2}}. Therefore,
: &lt;math&gt;Z = (-1)^n \left(1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cdots \cdot \frac{p-1}2\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Comparing with our first evaluation, we may cancel out the nonzero factor
: &lt;math&gt;1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cdots \cdot \frac{p-1}2&lt;/math&gt;
and we are left with
: &lt;math&gt;a^{(p-1)/2} = (-1)^n.&lt;/math&gt;
This is the desired result, because by [[Euler's criterion]] the left hand side is just an alternative expression for the Legendre symbol &lt;math&gt;\left (\frac{a}{p}\right )&lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications ==
Gauss's lemma is used in many,&lt;ref name="Lemmermeyer"&gt;{{citation
  | last1 = Lemmermeyer  | first1 = Franz
  | title = Reciprocity Laws: from Euler to Eisenstein
  | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]

  | isbn = 3-540-66957-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch. 1}}&lt;ref name="Lemmermeyer" /&gt;{{rp|9}} but by no means all, of the known proofs of quadratic reciprocity.

For example, [[Gotthold Eisenstein]]&lt;ref name="Lemmermeyer" /&gt;{{rp|236}} used Gauss's lemma to prove that if {{math|''p''}} is an odd prime then
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)=\prod_{n=1}^{(p-1)/2}\frac{\sin{(2\pi an/p)}}{\sin{(2\pi n/p)}},&lt;/math&gt;
and used this formula to prove quadratic reciprocity. By using [[Elliptic function|elliptic]] rather than [[Trigonometric functions|circular]] functions, he proved the [[cubic reciprocity|cubic]] and [[quartic reciprocity]] laws.&lt;ref name="Lemmermeyer" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 8}}

[[Leopold Kronecker]]&lt;ref name="Lemmermeyer" /&gt;{{rp|Ex. 1.34}} used the lemma to show that
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)=\sgn\prod_{i=1}^{\frac{q-1}{2}}\prod_{k=1}^{\frac{p-1}{2}}\left(\frac{k}{p}-\frac{i}{q}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Switching {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} immediately gives quadratic reciprocity.
 
It is also used in what are probably the simplest proofs of the "second supplementary law"
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{2}{p}\right) = (-1)^{(p^2-1)/8} = \begin{cases} +1\text{ if }p\equiv \pm 1\pmod {8}\\-1\text{ if }p\equiv \pm 3\pmod {8}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
Gauss's lemma can be used to prove the following statement, and the reverse is true too.

eh? are you implyng that one can deduce GL from the formula?

I'm removing this statement till someone can provide a reference, and moving the formula to the top of the section 
--&gt;

==Higher powers==

Generalizations of Gauss's lemma can be used to compute higher power residue symbols. In his second monograph on biquadratic reciprocity,&lt;ref name="GaussBQ"&gt;
{{citation
  | last1 = Gauss  | first1 = Carl Friedrich
  | title = Theoria residuorum biquadraticorum, Commentatio secunda
  | publisher = Comment. Soc. regiae sci
  | volume = 7
  | location = Göttingen
  | year = 1832}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|§§69&amp;ndash;71}} Gauss used a fourth-power lemma to derive the formula for the biquadratic character of {{math|1 + ''i''}} in {{math|'''Z'''[''i'']}}, the ring of [[Gaussian integers]]. Subsequently, Eisenstein used third- and fourth-power versions to prove [[cubic reciprocity|cubic]] and [[quartic reciprocity]].&lt;ref name="Lemmermeyer" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 8}}

===''n''th power residue symbol===
{{main article|Power residue symbol}}
Let ''k'' be an [[algebraic number field]] with [[ring of integers]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k,&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p} \subset \mathcal{O}_k &lt;/math&gt; be a [[Number field#Prime ideals|prime ideal]]. The [[ideal norm]] &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{N} \mathfrak{p} &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the cardinality of the residue class ring. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p} &lt;/math&gt; is prime this is a [[finite field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k / \mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;, so the ideal norm is &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{N} \mathfrak{p} = |\mathcal{O}_k / \mathfrak{p}|&lt;/math&gt;.

Assume that a primitive {{math|''n''}}th [[root of unity]] &lt;math&gt;\zeta_n\in\mathcal{O}_k,&lt;/math&gt; and that {{math|''n''}} and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p} &lt;/math&gt; are [[coprime]] (i.e. &lt;math&gt;n\not\in \mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;). Then no two distinct {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity can be congruent modulo &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;.

This can be proved by contradiction, beginning by assuming that &lt;math&gt;\zeta_n^r\equiv\zeta_n^s&lt;/math&gt; mod &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;, {{math|0 &lt; ''r'' &lt; ''s'' &amp;le; ''n''}}. Let {{math|''t'' &amp;#61; ''s'' &amp;minus; ''r''}} such that &lt;math&gt;\zeta_n^t\equiv 1&lt;/math&gt; mod &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;, and {{math|0 &lt; ''t'' &lt; ''n''}}. From the definition of roots of unity, 
:&lt;math&gt;x^n-1=(x-1)(x-\zeta_n)(x-\zeta_n^2)\dots(x-\zeta_n^{n-1}),&lt;/math&gt;
and dividing by {{math|''x'' &amp;minus; 1}} gives 
:&lt;math&gt;x^{n-1}+x^{n-2}+\dots +x + 1 =(x-\zeta_n)(x-\zeta_n^2)\dots(x-\zeta_n^{n-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

Letting {{math|''x'' &amp;#61; 1}} and taking residues mod &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;n\equiv(1-\zeta_n)(1-\zeta_n^2)\dots(1-\zeta_n^{n-1})\pmod{\mathfrak{p}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since  {{math|''n''}} and &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; are coprime, &lt;math&gt; n\not\equiv 0&lt;/math&gt; mod &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p},&lt;/math&gt; but under the assumption, one of the factors on the right must be zero. Therefore, the assumption that two distinct roots are congruent is false.

Thus the residue classes of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{O}_k / \mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; containing the powers of {{math|ζ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are a subgroup of order {{math|''n''}} of its (multiplicative) group of units, &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{O}_k/\mathfrak{p}) ^\times  = \mathcal{O}_k /\mathfrak{p}- \{0\}.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, the order of &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{O}_k/\mathfrak{p})^ \times&lt;/math&gt; is a multiple of {{math|''n''}}, and 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\mathrm{N} \mathfrak{p} &amp;= |\mathcal{O}_k / \mathfrak{p}| \\
                        &amp;= \left |(\mathcal{O}_k / \mathfrak{p} )^\times \right| + 1 \\
                        &amp;\equiv 1 \pmod{n}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

There is an analogue of Fermat's theorem in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathcal{O}_k&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\alpha\not\in \mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;, then&lt;ref name="Lemmermeyer" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 4.1}} 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^{\mathrm{N} \mathfrak{p} -1}\equiv 1 \pmod{\mathfrak{p} },&lt;/math&gt;
and since &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{N} \mathfrak{p} \equiv 1 &lt;/math&gt; mod {{math|''n''}},
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^{\frac{\mathrm{N} \mathfrak{p} -1}{n}}\equiv \zeta_n^s\pmod{\mathfrak{p} }&lt;/math&gt;
is well-defined and congruent to a unique {{math|''n''}}th root of unity &amp;zeta;&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;.

This root of unity is called the '''{{math|''n''}}th-power residue symbol for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_k,&lt;/math&gt;''' and is denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\left(\frac{\alpha}{\mathfrak{p} }\right)_n &amp;= \zeta_n^s \\
                                            &amp;\equiv \alpha^{\frac{\mathrm{N} \mathfrak{p} -1}{n}}\pmod{\mathfrak{p}}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

It can be proven that&lt;ref name="Lemmermeyer" /&gt;{{rp|Prop. 4.1}}
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\alpha}{\mathfrak{p} }\right)_n= 1&lt;/math&gt;
if and only if there is an &lt;math&gt;\eta \in\mathcal{O}_k&lt;/math&gt; such that {{math|''&amp;alpha;'' ≡ ''&amp;eta;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}} mod &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;.

===1/''n'' systems===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mu_n = \{1,\zeta_n,\zeta_n^2,\dots,\zeta_n^{n-1}\} &lt;/math&gt; be the multiplicative group of the {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity, and let &lt;math&gt;A=\{a_1, a_2,\dots,a_m\}&lt;/math&gt; be representatives of the cosets of &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{O}_k / \mathfrak{p})^\times/\mu_n.&lt;/math&gt; Then {{math|''A''}} is called a '''{{math|1/''n''}} system''' mod &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Lemmermeyer" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 4.2}}

In other words, there are &lt;math&gt;mn=\mathrm{N} \mathfrak{p} -1 &lt;/math&gt; numbers in the set &lt;math&gt;A\mu=\{ a_i \zeta_n^j\;:\; 1 \le i \le m, \;\;\;0 \le j \le n-1\},&lt;/math&gt; and this set constitutes a representative set for &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{O}_k / \mathfrak{p})^\times.&lt;/math&gt;

The numbers {{math|1, 2, … (''p'' &amp;minus; 1)/2}}, used in the original version of the lemma, are a 1/2 system (mod {{math|''p''}}).

Constructing a {{math|1/''n''}} system is straightforward: let {{math|''M''}} be a representative set for &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{O}_k / \mathfrak{p})^\times.&lt;/math&gt; Pick any &lt;math&gt;a_1\in M &lt;/math&gt; and remove the numbers congruent to &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_1\zeta_n, a_1\zeta_n^2, \dots, a_1\zeta_n^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; from {{math|''M''}}. Pick  {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} from {{math|''M''}} and remove the numbers congruent to &lt;math&gt;a_2, a_2\zeta_n, a_2\zeta_n^2, \dots, a_2\zeta_n^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; Repeat until {{math|''M''}} is exhausted. Then {{math|{{mset|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … ''a''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} is a {{math|1/''n''}} system mod &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

===The lemma for ''n''th powers===
Gauss's lemma may be extended to the {{math|''n''}}th power residue symbol as follows.&lt;ref name="Lemmermeyer" /&gt;{{rp|Prop. 4.3}} Let &lt;math&gt;\zeta_n\in \mathcal{O}_k &lt;/math&gt; be a primitive {{math|''n''}}th root of unity, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p} \subset \mathcal{O}_k &lt;/math&gt; a prime ideal, &lt;math&gt;\gamma \in \mathcal{O}_k, \;\;n\gamma\not\in\mathfrak{p},&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; is coprime to both {{math|''γ''}} and {{math|''n''}}) and let {{math|''A'' &amp;#61; {{mset|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}} be a  {{math|1/''n''}} system mod &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then for each {{math|''i''}}, {{math|1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''m''}}, there are integers {{math|''π''(''i'')}}, unique (mod {{math|''m''}}), and {{math|''b''(''i'')}}, unique (mod {{math|''n''}}),  such that
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma a_i \equiv \zeta_n^{b(i)}a_{\pi(i)} \pmod{\mathfrak{p}},&lt;/math&gt;
and the {{math|''n''}}th-power residue symbol is given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\gamma}{\mathfrak{p} }\right)_n = \zeta_n^{b(1)+b(2)+\dots+b(m)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The classical lemma for the quadratic Legendre symbol is the special case {{math|''n'' &amp;#61; 2}}, {{math|''ζ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;#61; &amp;minus;1}}, {{math|''A'' &amp;#61; {{mset|1, 2, …, (''p'' &amp;minus; 1)/2}}}}, {{math|''b''(''k'') &amp;#61; 1}} if {{math|''ak'' &gt; ''p''/2}}, {{math|''b''(''k'') &amp;#61; 0}} if {{math|''ak'' &lt; ''p''/2}}.

====Proof====
The proof of the {{math|''n''}}th-power lemma uses the same ideas that were used in the proof of the quadratic lemma.

The existence of the integers {{math|''π''(''i'')}} and {{math|''b''(''i'')}}, and their uniqueness  (mod {{math|''m''}}) and (mod {{math|''n''}}), respectively, come from the fact that {{math|''Aμ''}} is a representative set.

Assume that {{math|''π''(''i'')}} = {{math|''π''(''j'')}} = {{math|''p''}}, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma a_i \equiv \zeta_n^r a_p \pmod{\mathfrak{p}}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\gamma a_j \equiv \zeta_n^s a_p \pmod{\mathfrak{p}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Then
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_n^{s-r}\gamma a_i \equiv \zeta_n^s a_p \equiv \gamma a_j\pmod{\mathfrak{p}}&lt;/math&gt;
Because {{math|''γ''}} and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; are coprime both sides can be divided by {{math|''γ''}}, giving 
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_n^{s-r} a_i \equiv a_j\pmod{\mathfrak{p}},&lt;/math&gt;
which, since {{math|''A''}} is a {{math|1/''n''}} system, implies {{math|''s'' &amp;#61; ''r''}} and {{math|''i'' &amp;#61; ''j''}}, showing that {{math|''π''}} is a permutation of the set {{math|{{mset|1, 2, …, ''m''}}}}.

Then on the one hand, by the definition of the power residue symbol,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(\gamma a_1)(\gamma a_2)\dots(\gamma a_m) &amp;= \gamma^{\frac{\mathrm{N} \mathfrak{p} -1}{n}} a_1 a_2\dots a_m \\
                                          &amp;\equiv \left(\frac{\gamma}{\mathfrak{p} }\right)_n a_1 a_2\dots a_m \pmod{\mathfrak{p}},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
and on the other hand, since {{math|''π''}} is a permutation,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(\gamma a_1)(\gamma a_2)\dots(\gamma a_m) 
&amp;\equiv 
{\zeta_n^{b(1)}a_{\pi(1)}} {\zeta_n^{b(2)}a_{\pi(2)}}\dots{\zeta_n^{b(m)}a_{\pi(m)}} 
&amp;\pmod{\mathfrak{p}}\\
&amp;\equiv
\zeta_n^{b(1)+b(2)+\dots+b(m)}a_{\pi(1)} a_{\pi(2)}\dots a_{\pi(m)}
&amp;\pmod{\mathfrak{p}}\\
&amp;\equiv
\zeta_n^{b(1)+b(2)+\dots+b(m)} a_1 a_2\dots a_m
&amp;\pmod{\mathfrak{p}},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
so
:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\frac{\gamma}{\mathfrak{p} }\right)_n a_1 a_2\dots a_m \equiv \zeta_n^{b(1)+b(2)+\dots+b(m)} a_1 a_2\dots a_m
\pmod{\mathfrak{p}},
&lt;/math&gt;
and since for all {{math|1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''m''}}, {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; are coprime, {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;…''a''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be cancelled from both sides of the congruence,
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\gamma}{\mathfrak{p} }\right)_n \equiv \zeta_n^{b(1)+b(2)+\dots+b(m)} 
\pmod{\mathfrak{p}},
&lt;/math&gt;
and the theorem follows from the fact that no two distinct {{math|''n''}}th roots of unity can be congruent (mod &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;).

== Relation to the transfer in group theory ==

Let {{math|''G''}} be the multiplicative group of nonzero residue classes in {{math|'''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''}}, and let {{math|''H''}} be the subgroup {+1, &amp;minus;1}. Consider the following coset representatives of {{math|''H''}} in {{math|''G''}},
:&lt;math&gt;1, 2, 3, \dots, \frac{p-1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the machinery of the [[transfer (group theory)|transfer]] to this collection of coset representatives, we obtain the transfer homomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\phi : G \to H,&lt;/math&gt;
which turns out to be the map that sends {{math|''a''}} to {{math|(&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''n''}} are as in the statement of the lemma. Gauss's lemma may then be viewed as a computation that explicitly identifies this homomorphism as being the quadratic residue character.

'''HashClash''' was a [[distributed computing]] project to find [[hash collision|collision]]s in the [[MD5]] [[hash algorithm]]. It was based at Department of [[Mathematics]] and [[Computer Science]] at the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], and [[Marc Stevens (cryptology)|Marc Stevens]] initiated the project as part of his [[master's degree]] [[thesis]].

The project ended after Stevens defended his M.Sc. thesis in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens's thesis "On Collisions for MD5" is [http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/On%20Collisions%20for%20MD5%20-%20M.M.J.%20Stevens.pdf available for download].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herbert Federer''' (July 23, 1920 – April 21, 2010)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/Dir?sid=1011&amp;view=basic&amp;pg=srch |title=NAS Membership Directory: Federer, Herbert |author= |date= |work= |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[mathematician]]. He is one of the creators of [[geometric measure theory]], at the meeting point of [[differential geometry]] and [[mathematical analysis]].&lt;ref name="ams_2012"&gt;Parks, H. (2012) [http://www.ams.org/notices/201205/rtx120500622p.pdf ''Remembering Herbert Federer (1920–2010)''], [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society|NAMS]] '''59'''(5), 622-631.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Federer was born July 23, 1920, in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. After emigrating to the US in 1938, he studied mathematics and physics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], earning the Ph.D. as a student of [[Anthony Morse]] in 1944. He then spent virtually his entire career as a member of the [[Brown University]] Mathematics Department, where he eventually retired with the title of Professor Emeritus.

Federer wrote more than thirty research papers in addition to his book ''Geometric measure theory''. The [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]] assigns him nine Ph.D. students and well over a hundred subsequent descendants. His most productive students include the late [[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.]] (1933–1997) a professor at Princeton for 35 years, and his last student, [[Robert Miller Hardt|Robert Hardt]], now at Rice University.

Federer was a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. In 1987, he and his Brown colleague [[Wendell Fleming]] won the American Mathematical Society's [[Steele Prize]] "for their pioneering work in ''Normal and Integral currents''."

==Normal and integral currents==

Federer's mathematical work separates thematically into the periods before and after his watershed 1960 paper ''Normal and integral currents'', co-authored with Fleming. That paper provided the first satisfactory general solution to [[Plateau's problem]] — the problem of finding a (k+1)-dimensional least-area surface spanning a given k-dimensional boundary cycle in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Their solution inaugurated a new and fruitful period of research on a large class of geometric variational problems — especially minimal surfaces — via what came to be known as Geometric Measure Theory.

==Earlier work==

During the 15 years or so years prior to that paper, Federer worked at the technical interface of geometry and measure theory. He focused particularly on surface area, rectifiability of sets, and the extent to which one could substitute rectifiability for smoothness in the analysis of surfaces. His 1947 paper on the rectifiable subsets of n-space characterized purely unrectifiable sets by their "invisibility" under almost all projections. [[Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch|A. S. Besicovitch]] had proven this for 1-dimensional sets in the plane, but Federer's generalization, valid for subsets of arbitrary dimension in any Euclidean space, was a major technical accomplishment, and later played a key role in ''Normal and Integral Currents''.

In 1958, Federer wrote ''Curvature Measures'', a paper that took some early steps toward understanding second-order properties of surfaces lacking the differentiability properties typically assumed in order to discuss curvature. He also developed and named what he called the [[coarea formula]] in that paper. That formula has become a standard analytical tool.

==Geometric measure theory==

Federer is perhaps best known for his treatise ''Geometric Measure Theory'', published in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Goffman, Casper|title=Review: ''Geometric measure theory'', by Herbert Federer|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1971|volume=77|issue=1|pages=27–35|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1971-12603-4|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1971-77-01/S0002-9904-1971-12603-4/S0002-9904-1971-12603-4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intended as both a text and a reference work, the book is unusually complete, general and authoritative: its nearly 600 pages cover a substantial amount of linear and multilinear algebra, give a profound treatment of measure theory, integration and differentiation, and then move on to rectifiability, theory of currents, and finally, variational applications.  Nevertheless, the book's unique style exhibits a rare and artistic economy that still inspires admiration, respect—and exasperation.  A more accessible introduction may be found in F. Morgan's book listed below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14655">In [[mathematics]], the '''Hopf decomposition''', named after [[Eberhard Hopf]], gives a canonical decomposition of a [[measure space]]  (''X'', μ) with respect to an invertible non-singular transformation ''T'', i.e. a transformation which with its inverse is measurable and carries [[null set]]s onto null sets. Up to null sets, ''X'' can be written as a disjoint union ''C'' ∐ ''D'' of ''T''-invariant sets where the actions of ''T'' on ''C''  and ''D'' are [[Wandering_set#Wandering_sets_and_dissipative_systems|conservative and dissipative]]. Thus, if τ is the automorphism of ''A'' = L&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') induced by ''T'', there is a unique τ-invariant projection ''p'' in ''A'' such that ''pA'' is conservative and ''(I–p)A'' is dissipative.
==Definitions==
*'''Wandering sets and dissipative actions.''' A measurable subset ''W'' of ''X'' is ''wandering'' if its characteristic function ''q'' = χ&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''A'' = L&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'') satisfies ''q''τ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') = 0 for all ''n''; thus, up to null sets, the translates ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''W'') are disjoint. An action is called ''dissipative'' if ''X'' = ∐ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''W'') for some wandering set ''W''.

*'''Conservative actions.''' If ''X'' has no wandering subsets of positive measure, the action is said to be ''conservative''. 

*'''Incompressible actions.''' An action is said to be ''incompressible'' if whenever a measurable subset ''Z'' satisfies ''T''(''Z'') ⊊ ''Z'' then {{math|''Z'' \ ''TZ''}} has measure zero. Thus if ''q'' = χ&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt; and τ(''q'') ≤ ''q'', then τ(''q'') = ''q''. 

*'''Recurrent actions.''' An action ''T'' is said to be ''recurrent'' if ''q'' ≤ τ(''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ ... for any ''q'' = χ&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;. 

*'''Infinitely recurrent actions.''' An action ''T''  is said to be ''infinitely recurrent'' if ''q'' ≤ τ&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; (''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;''m'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;''m''+2&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ ... for any ''q'' = χ&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; and any ''m'' ≥ 1.

==Recurrence theorem==
'''Theorem.''' If ''T'' is an invertible transformation on a measure space (''X'',μ) preserving null sets, then the following conditions are equivalent on ''T'' (or its inverse):&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krengel|1985|pages=16-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''T'' is conservative;
# ''T'' is recurrent;
# ''T'' is infinitely recurrent;
# ''T'' is incompressible.

Since ''T'' is dissipative if and only if ''T''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; is dissipative, it follows that ''T'' is conservative if and only if  ''T''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt; is conservative.

If ''T'' is conservative, then ''r'' = ''q'' ∧ (τ(''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ ⋅⋅⋅)&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; = ''q'' ∧ τ(1 - ''q'') ∧ τ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(1 -''q'') ∧ τ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∧ ... is wandering so that if ''q'' &lt; 1, necessarily ''r'' = 0. Hence ''q'' ≤ τ(''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ ⋅⋅⋅, so that  ''T'' is recurrent.

If ''T'' is recurrent, then ''q'' ≤ τ(''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ ⋅⋅⋅ Now assume by induction that ''q'' ≤ τ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ ⋅⋅⋅. Then τ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ≤ τ&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ ⋅⋅⋅ ≤ . Hence ''q'' ≤ τ&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ ⋅⋅⋅. So the result holds for ''k''+1 and thus ''T'' is infinitely recurrent. Conversely by definition an infinitely recurrent transformation is recurrent.

Now suppose that ''T'' is recurrent. To show that ''T'' is incompressible it must be shown that, if τ(''q'') ≤ ''q'', then τ(''q'') ≤ ''q''. In fact in this case τ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') is a decreasing sequence. But by recurrence, ''q'' ≤ τ(''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ τ&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') ∨ ⋅⋅⋅ , so ''q'' ≤ τ(''q'') and hence ''q'' = τ(''q'').

Finally suppose that ''T'' is incompressible. If ''T'' is not conservative there is a ''p'' ≠ 0 in ''A'' with the τ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''p'') disjoint (orthogonal). But then ''q'' = ''p'' ⊕ τ(''p'') ⊕ τ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''p'') ⊕ ⋅⋅⋅ satisfies τ(''q'') &lt; ''q'' with {{math|1=''q'' − τ(''q'') = ''p'' ≠ 0}}, contradicting incompressibility. So ''T'' is conservative.

==Hopf decomposition==
'''Theorem.''' If ''T'' is an invertible transformation on a measure space (''X'',''μ'') preserving null sets and inducing an automorphism ''τ'' of ''A'' = ''L''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''X''), then there is a unique ''τ''-invariant ''p'' = ''χ''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''A'' such that ''τ'' is conservative on ''pA'' = ''L''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''C'') and dissipative on (1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'')''A'' = ''L''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''D'') where ''D'' =&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''C''.&lt;ref&gt; {{harvnb|Krengel|1985|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;small&gt;Without loss of generality it can be assumed that μ is a probability measure. If ''T'' is conservative there is nothing to prove, since in that case ''C'' = ''X''. Otherwise there is a wandering set ''W'' for ''T''. Let ''r'' = ''χ''&lt;sub&gt;''W''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q'' = ⊕ ''τ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''r''). Thus ''q'' is ''τ''-invariant and dissipative. Moreover  ''μ''(''q'') &gt; 0. Clearly an orthogonal direct sum of such ''τ''-invariant dissipative ''q''&amp;prime;s is also  ''τ''-invariant and dissipative; and if ''q'' is ''τ''-invariant and dissipative and ''r'' &lt; ''q'' is  ''τ''-invariant, then ''r'' is dissipative. Hence if ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are ''τ''-invariant and dissipative, then ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is ''τ''-invariant and dissipative, since ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Now let ''M'' be the supremum of all ''μ''(''q'') wirh ''q'' ''τ''-invariant and dissipative. Take ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''τ''-invariant and dissipative such that ''μ''(''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) increases to ''M''. Replacing ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; by ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∨ ⋅⋅⋅ ∨ ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t'' can be assumed that ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is increasing to ''q'' say. By continuity ''q'' is ''τ''-invariant and ''μ''(''q'') = ''M''. By maximality ''p'' = ''I'' − ''q'' is conservative. Uniqueness is clear since no ''τ''-invariant ''r'' &lt; ''p'' is dissipative and every ''τ''-invariant ''r'' &lt; ''q'' is dissipative.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Corollary.''' The Hopf decomposition for ''T'' coincides with the Hopf decomposition for ''T''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

:&lt;small&gt;Since a transformation is dissipative on a measure space if and only if its inverse is dissipitive, the dissipative parts of ''T'' and ''T''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; coincide. Hence so do the conservative parts.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Corollary.''' The Hopf decomposition for ''T'' coincides with the Hopf decomposition for ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for ''n'' &gt; 1.

:&lt;small&gt; If ''W'' is a wandering set for ''T'' then it is a wandering set for ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. So the dissipative part of ''T'' is contained in the dissipative part of ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Let σ = τ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. To prove the converse, it suffices to show that if σ is dissipative, then τ is dissipative.  If not, using the Hopf decomposition, it can be assumed that σ is dissipative and τ conservative. Suppose that ''p'' is a non-zero wandering projection for σ. Then τ&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;(''p'') and  τ&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;(''p'') are orthogonal for different ''a'' and ''b'' in the same congruence class modulo ''n''. Take a set of τ&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;(''p'') with non-zero product and maximal size. Thus |''S''| ≤ ''n''. By maximality, ''r'' is wandering for τ, a contradiction.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Corollary.''' If an invertible transformation ''T'' acts ergodically but non-transitively on the measure space (''X'',''μ'') preserving null sets and ''B'' is a subset with ''μ''(''B'') &gt; 0, then the complement of ''B'' ∪ ''TB'' ∪ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''B'' ∪ ⋅⋅⋅ has measure zero.

:&lt;small&gt;Note that ergodicity and non-transitivity imply that the action of ''T'' is conservative and hence infinitely recurrent. But then  ''B'' ≤ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; (''B'') ∨ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''m'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'') ∨ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''m''+2&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'') ∨ ... for any ''m'' ≥ 1. Applying ''T''&lt;sup&gt;−''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, it follows that ''T''&lt;sup&gt;−''m''&lt;/sup&gt;(''B'') lies in  ''Y'' = ''B'' ∪ ''TB'' ∪ ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''B'' ∪ ⋅⋅⋅ for every ''m'' &gt; 0. By ergodicity ''μ''(''X'' \ ''Y'') = 0.&lt;/small&gt;

==Hopf decomposition for a non-singular flow==
Let (''X'',μ) be a measure space and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; a non-sngular flow on ''X'' inducing a 1-parameter group of automorphisms σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''A'' = L&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''X''). It will be assumed that the action is faithful, so that σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is the identity only for ''t'' = 0. For each ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; or equivalently σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;  with ''t'' ≠ 0 there is a Hopf decomposition, so a ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; fixed by σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; such that the action is conservative on ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;''A'' and dissipative on (1−''p''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;)''A''. 

*For ''s'', ''t''  ≠ 0 the conservative and dissipative parts of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; coincide if ''s''/''t'' is rational.&lt;ref&gt; {{harvnb|Krengel|1985|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;small&gt;This follows from the fact that for any non-singular invertible transformation the conservative and dissipative parts of ''T'' and ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; coincide for ''n'' ≠ 0.&lt;/small&gt;

*If ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt; is dissipative on ''A'' = L&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''X''), then there is an invariant measure λ on ''A'' and ''p'' in ''A'' such that 
:# ''p'' &gt;  σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') for all ''t'' &gt; 0
:# λ(''p'' – σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'')) = ''t'' for all ''t'' &gt; 0 
:# σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') &lt;math&gt;\uparrow&lt;/math&gt; 1 as ''t'' tends to −∞ and  σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') &lt;math&gt;\downarrow&lt;/math&gt; 0 as ''t'' tends to +∞.

:&lt;small&gt; Let ''T'' = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Take ''q'' a wandering set for ''T'' so that ⊕ τ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') = 1. Changing μ to an equivalent measure, it can be assumed that μ(''q'')  = 1, so that μ restricts to a probability measure on ''qA''. Transporting this measure to τ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'')''A'', it can further be assumed that μ is τ-invariant on ''A''. But then {{math|1=λ = ∫{{su|b=0|p=1}}  μ ∘ σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; ''dt''}} is an equivalent σ-invariant measure on ''A'' which can be rescaled if necessary so that λ(''q'') = 1. The ''r'' in ''A'' that are wandering for ''Τ'' (or τ) with ⊕ τ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''r'') = 1 are easily described: they are given by ''r'' =  ⊕ τ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''q'' = ⊕ ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a decomposition of ''q''. In particular λ(''r'') =1. Moreover if ''p'' satisfies ''p'' &gt; τ(''p'') and τ&lt;sup&gt;–''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''p'') &lt;math&gt;\uparrow&lt;/math&gt; 1, then  λ(''p''– τ(''p'')) = 1, applying the result to ''r'' =  ''p'' – τ(''p''). The same arguments show  that conversely, if ''r'' is wandering for τ and λ(''r'') = 1, then {{math|1= ⊕ τ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''r'') = 1}}.&lt;/small&gt;

:&lt;small&gt;Let ''Q'' = ''q'' ⊕ τ(''q'') ⊕ τ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (''q'') ⊕ ⋅⋅⋅ so that τ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; (''Q'') &lt; ''Q'' for ''k'' ≥ 1. Then {{math|1=''a'' = ∫{{su|b=0|p=∞}} σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'') ''dt'' = ∑&lt;sub&gt;''k''≥0&lt;/sub&gt; ∫{{su|b=0|p=1}} σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''+''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'') ''dt'' = ∫{{su|b=0|p=1}} σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''Q'') ''dt''}} so that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1 in ''A''. By definition  σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'') ≤ ''a'' for ''s'' ≥ 0, since {{math|1=''a'' − σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'') = ∫{{su|b=''s''|p=∞}} σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'') ''dt''}}. The same formulas show that σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'') tends 0 or 1 as ''s'' tends to +∞ or −∞. Set ''p'' = χ&lt;sub&gt;[ε,1]&lt;/sub&gt;(a) for 0 &lt; ε &lt; 1. Then σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') = χ&lt;sub&gt;[ε,1]&lt;/sub&gt;(σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'')). It follows immediately that σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') ≤ ''p'' for ''s'' ≥ 0. Moreover σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') &lt;math&gt;\downarrow&lt;/math&gt; 0 as ''s'' tends to +∞ and  σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') &lt;math&gt;\uparrow&lt;/math&gt; 1 as ''s'' tends to − ∞. The first limit formula follows because 0 ≤ ε ⋅ σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') ≤ σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''a''). Now the same reasoning can be applied to τ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, σ&lt;sub&gt;−''t''&lt;/sub&gt;, τ&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''q'') and 1 – ε in place of τ, σ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q'' and ε. Then it is easily checked that the quantities corresponding to ''a'' and ''p'' are 1 − ''a'' and 1 − ''p''. Consequently σ&lt;sub&gt;−''t''&lt;/sub&gt;(1−''p'') &lt;math&gt;\downarrow &lt;/math&gt; 0 as ''t'' tends to ∞. Hence σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') &lt;math&gt;\uparrow&lt;/math&gt; 1 as ''s'' tends to − ∞. In particular ''p'' ≠ 0 , 1. &lt;/small&gt;

:&lt;small&gt;So ''r'' = ''p'' − τ(''p'') is wandering for τ and ⊕ τ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''r'') = 1. Hence λ(''r'') = 1. It follows that  λ(''p'' −σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') ) = ''s'' for ''s'' = 1/''n'' and therefore for all rational ''s'' &gt; 0. Since the family  σ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'') is continuous and decreasing, by continuity the same formula also holds for all real ''s'' &gt; 0.  Hence ''p'' satisfies all the asserted conditions. &lt;/small&gt;

*The conservative and dissipative parts of ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''t'' ≠ 0  are independent of ''t''.&lt;ref&gt; {{harvnb|Krengel|1968|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;small&gt; The previous result shows that if ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is dissipative on ''X'' for ''t'' ≠ 0 then so is every ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''s'' ≠ 0. By uniqueness, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; preserve the dissipative parts of the other. Hence each is dissipative on the dissipative part of the other, so the dissipative parts agree. Hence the conservative parts agree. &lt;/small&gt;

'''Human height''' or '''stature''' is the distance from the bottom of the feet to the top of the head in a [[human body]], standing erect. It is measured using a [[stadiometer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stadiometers and Height Measurement Devices|url=https://www.stadiometer.com/|website=stadiometer.com|publisher=stadiometer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually in centimetres when using the [[metric system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using the BMI-for-Age Growth Charts |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/growthcharts/training/modules/module1/text/page6bmetric.htm |website=cdc.gov |publisher=[[Center for Disease Control]] |accessdate=5 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130012800/http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/growthcharts/training/modules/module1/text/page6bmetric.htm |archivedate=30 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Price, Beth|title=MathsWorld Year 8 VELS Edition|date=2009|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|MacMillan]]|location=Australia|page=626|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2veDRPjMggC&amp;printsec=frontcover|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or feet and inches when using the [[imperial system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lapham, Robert  |author2=Agar, Heather |title=Drug Calculations for Nurses|date=2009|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|location=USA|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1_vAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carter|first1=Pamela J.|title=Lippincott's Textbook for Nursing Assistants: A Humanistic Approach to Caregiving|date=2008|publisher=[[Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|location=USA|page=306|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=biM2u4JfxZYC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular genetic profile in men called [[Haplogroup I-M170|Y haplotype I-M170]] is [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] with height. Ecological data shows that as the frequency of this genetic profile increases in the population, the average male height in a country also increases.

Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature &amp; a longer life expectancy. Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure &amp; are less likely to acquire cancer. The University of Hawaii has found that the “longevity gene” FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of a small body size. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web. |title=‘Shorter men live longer, study shows‘|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140509110756.htm&lt;/ref&gt;Short stature decreases the risk of [[Chronic venous insufficiency|venous insufficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Tall height' |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000203.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When populations share genetic background and environmental factors, average height is frequently characteristic within the group. Exceptional height variation (around 20% deviation from average) within such a population is sometimes due to [[gigantism]] or [[dwarfism]], which are medical conditions caused by specific [[gene]]s or [[endocrine]] abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;Ganong, William F. (2001) ''Review of Medical Physiology'', Lange Medical, pp. 392–397, {{ISBN|0071605673}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of human height can serve as an indicator of two key welfare components, namely nutritional quality and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107507180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regions of poverty or warfare, environmental factors like chronic malnutrition during childhood or adolescence may result in delayed growth and/or marked reductions in adult stature even without the presence of any of these medical conditions. Some research indicates that a greater height correlates with greater success in dating and earning in men, although other research indicates that this does not apply to non-white men.&lt;ref&gt;https://psmag.com/social-justice/the-problem-with-being-tall-male-and-black&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determinants of growth and height==
[[Image:Human height growth per month, United States.png|thumb|right|300px|The median (50th percentile) growth curves for male and females 0–20 years in the United States.]]
The study of height is known as [[auxology]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermanussen, Michael (ed) (2013) ''Auxology – Studying Human Growth and Development'', Schweizerbart, {{ISBN|9783510652785}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth has long been recognized as a measure of the [[health]] of individuals, hence part of the reasoning for the use of growth charts. For individuals, as indicators of health problems, growth trends are tracked for significant deviations and growth is also monitored for significant deficiency from genetic expectations. Genetics is a major factor in determining the height of individuals, though it is far less influential in regard to differences among populations. Average height is relevant to the measurement of the health and wellness ([[standard of living]] and [[quality of life]]) of populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bolton-Smith | first1 = C. | title = Accuracy of the estimated prevalence of obesity from self reported height and weight in an adult Scottish population | doi = 10.1136/jech.54.2.143 | journal = Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health | volume = 54 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–148 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = 1731630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attributed as a significant reason for the trend of increasing height in parts of Europe are the egalitarian populations where proper [[Health care|medical care]] and adequate nutrition are relatively equally distributed.&lt;ref name=kolmos2004&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Komlos | first1 = J. | last2 = Baur | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1016/j.ehb.2003.12.006 | title = From the tallest to (one of) the fattest: The enigmatic fate of the American population in the 20th century | journal = Economics &amp; Human Biology | volume = 2 | pages = 57–74 | year = 2004 | pmid =  15463993| pmc = | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Average (male) height in a nation is correlated with [[protein quality]]. Nations that consume more protein in the form of meat, [[dairy]], [[egg (food)|eggs]], and [[fish]] tend to be taller, while those that attain more protein from [[cereals]] tend to be shorter.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Changes in [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] (nutrition) and a general rise in quality of health care and standard of living are the cited factors in the Asian populations. Malnutrition including chronic undernutrition and acute malnutrition is known to have caused [[stunted growth]] in various populations.&lt;ref name="onis20122"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = De Onis | first1 = M. | last2 = Blössner | first2 = M. | last3 = Borghi | first3 = E. | doi = 10.1017/S1368980011001315 | title = Prevalence and trends of stunting among pre-school children, 1990–2020 | journal = Public Health Nutrition | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 142–148 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21752311| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been seen in North Korea, parts of Africa, certain historical Europe, and other populations.&lt;ref name="grantham2007"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grantham-Mcgregor | first1 = S. | last2 = Cheung | first2 = Y.

Height measurements are by nature subject to statistical sampling errors even for a single individual.{{clarify|date=June 2016}} In a clinical situation, height measurements are seldom taken more often than once per office visit, which may mean sampling taking place a week to several months apart. The smooth 50th percentile male and female growth curves illustrated above are aggregate values from thousands of individuals sampled at ages from birth to age 20. In reality, a single individual's growth curve shows large upward and downward spikes, partly due to actual differences in growth velocity, and partly due to small measurement errors.

For example, a typical measurement error of plus or minus 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm may completely nullify 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm of actual growth resulting in either a "negative" 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm growth (due to overestimation in the previous visit combined with underestimation in the latter), up to a 1.5&amp;nbsp;cm growth (the first visit underestimating and the second visit overestimating) in the same elapsed time period between measurements. Note there is a discontinuity in the growth curves at age 2, which reflects the difference in recumbent length (with the child on his or her back), used in measuring infants and toddlers and standing height typically measured from age 2 onwards.

[[Image:Galton-height-regress.jpg|thumb|300px|Sir [[Francis Galton]]'s (1889) data showing the relationship between offspring height (928 individuals) as a function of mean parent height (205 sets of parents). The [[correlation]] was 0.57.]]
Height, like other [[phenotypic]] traits, is determined by a combination of [[genetics]] and [[environmental factor]]s. A child's height based on parental heights is subject to [[regression toward the mean]], therefore extremely tall or short parents will likely have correspondingly taller or shorter offspring, but their offspring will also likely be closer to average height than the parents themselves. Genetic potential and a number of hormones, minus illness, is a basic determinant for height. Other factors include the genetic response to external factors such as diet, exercise, environment, and life circumstances.

Humans grow fastest (other than in the womb) as [[infant]]s and [[toddler]]s, rapidly declining from a maximum at birth to roughly age 2, tapering to a slowly declining rate, and then during the [[pubertal]] growth spurt, a rapid rise to a second maximum (at around 11–12 years for female, and 13–14 years for male), followed by a steady decline to zero. On average, female growth speed trails off to zero at about 15 or 16 years, whereas the male curve continues for approximately 3 more years, going to zero at about 18–19. These are also critical periods where stressors such as malnutrition (or even severe [[child neglect]]) have the greatest effect.

Moreover, the health of a mother throughout her life, especially during her critical period and [[pregnancy]], has a role. A healthier child and adult develops a body that is better able to provide optimal prenatal conditions.&lt;ref name="grantham2007" /&gt; The pregnant mother's health is important for herself but also for the fetus as [[gestation]] is itself a critical period for an [[embryo]]/[[fetus]], though some problems affecting height during this period are resolved by catch-up growth assuming childhood conditions are good. Thus, there is a cumulative generation effect such that nutrition and health over generations influences the height of descendants to varying degrees.

The age of the mother also has some influence on her child's height. Studies in modern times have observed a gradual increase in height with maternal age, though these early studies suggest that trend is due to various socio-economic situations that select certain demographics as being more likely to have a first birth early in the mother's life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v57/n1/fig_tab/1601508t1.html#figure-title Table 1.

=== Nature versus nurture ===
The precise relationship between [[nature versus nurture|genetics and environment]] is complex and uncertain. Differences in human height is 60–80% [[Heritability|heritable]], according to several [[twin study|twin studies]]&lt;ref name=weedon&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-much-of-human-height/|title=How much of human height is genetic and how much is due to nutrition? |author=Lai, Chao-Qiang |journal=Scientific American|date=11 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been considered [[polygenic]] since the [[Mendelian-biometrician debate]] a hundred years ago. A genome-wide association (GWA) study of more than 180,000 individuals has identified hundreds of genetic variants in at least 180 loci associated with adult human height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hundreds of variants clustered in genomic loci and biological pathways affect human height|journal=Nature|year=2010|issue=7317|pages= 832–838 |vauthors=Lango Allen H, etal |volume=467|doi=10.1038/nature09410|pmid=20881960|pmc=2955183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of individuals has since been expanded to 253,288 individuals and the number of genetic variants identified is 697 in 423 genetic loci.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Defining the role of common variation in the genomic and biological architecture of adult human height|journal=Nature Genetics|year=2014|issue=11|pages=1173–1186 |vauthors=Wood AR, etal |pmid=25282103|doi=10.1038/ng.3097|volume=46|pmc=4250049}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate study of [[body proportion]] using sitting-height ratio, it reports that these 697 variants can be partitioned into 3 specific classes, (1) variants that primarily determine leg length, (2) variants that primarily determine spine and head length, or (3) variants that affect overall body size.

The effect of environment on height is illustrated by studies performed by anthropologist [[Barry Bogin]] and coworkers of Guatemala Mayan children living in the United States. In the early 1970s, when Bogin first visited [[Guatemala]], he observed that [[Mayan Indian]] men averaged only {{convert|157.5|cm|ftin|frac=2}} in height and the women averaged {{convert|142.2|cm|ftin|frac=2}}. Bogin took another series of measurements after the [[Guatemalan Civil War]], during which up to a million Guatemalans fled to the United States. He discovered that Maya refugees, who ranged from six to twelve years old, were significantly taller than their Guatemalan counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 40–44 | last = Bogin | first = Barry | title = The tall and the short of it | journal = Discover | accessdate = 26 April 2013 | year = 1998 | url = http://courses.washington.edu/bioa101/articles/article38.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, the American Maya were {{convert|10.24|cm|in|abbr=on}} taller than the Guatemalan Maya of the same age, largely due to better nutrition and [[health care]].&lt;ref name="bogin2003" /&gt; Bogin also noted that American Maya children had relatively longer legs, averaging {{convert|7.02|cm|in|abbr=on}} longer than the Guatemalan Maya (a significantly lower sitting height ratio).&lt;ref name=bogin2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bogin | first1 = B. | last2 = Rios | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1016/S1095-6433(02)00294-5 | title = Rapid morphological change in living humans: Implications for modern human origins | journal = Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A | volume = 136 | pages = 71–84 | year = 2003 | pmid =  14527631| pmc = | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Krawitz, Jan |url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2005/bigenough/special_heightgap_04.html |title=P.O.V. – Big Enough |publisher=PBS |date=28 June 2006 |accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nilotic]] peoples of Sudan such as the [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]] and [[Dinka]] have been described as some of the tallest in the world.

==Process of growth==
{{See also|Adolescence#Growth spurt}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Endocrine growth regulation.svg|thumb|The main pathways in the endocrine regulation of growth]]

Growth in stature, determined by its various factors, results from the lengthening of bones via cellular divisions chiefly regulated by [[somatotropin]] (human [[growth hormone]] (hGH)) secreted by the anterior [[pituitary]] gland. Somatotropin also stimulates the release of another growth inducing hormone [[Insulin-like growth factor 1]] (IGF-1) mainly by the liver. Both hormones operate on most tissues of the body, have many other functions, and continue to be secreted throughout life; with peak levels coinciding with peak growth velocity, and gradually subsiding with age after [[adolescence]]. The bulk of secretion occurs in bursts (especially for adolescents) with the largest during sleep.

The majority of linear growth occurs as growth of cartilage at the [[epiphysis]] (ends) of the [[long bone]]s which gradually [[Endochondral ossification|ossify]] to form hard bone. The legs compose approximately half of adult human height, and leg length is a somewhat [[sexually dimorphic]] trait, with men having proportionately longer legs. Some of this growth occurs after the growth spurt of the long bones has ceased or slowed. The majority of growth during growth spurts is of the long bones. Additionally, the variation in height between populations and across time is largely due to changes in leg length. The remainder of height consists of the cranium. Height is sexually dimorphic and statistically it is more or less [[normal distribution|normally distributed]], but with [[heavy tail]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} 
It has been shown that a [[log-normal distribution]] fits the data equally well, besides guaranteeing a non-negative lower [[confidence limit]], which could otherwise attain a non-physical negative height value for arbitrarily large confidence levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Limpert |first1=E |last2=Stahel |first2=W |last3=Abbt |first3=M |title=Lognormal distributions across the sciences: keys and clues |journal=BioScience |year=2001 |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=341–352 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0341:LNDATS]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Height abnormalities==

Most intra-population variance of height is genetic. [[Short stature]] and tall stature are usually not a health concern. If the degree of deviation from normal is significant, hereditary short stature is known as familial short stature and tall stature is known as familial tall stature. Confirmation that exceptional height is normal for a respective person can be ascertained from comparing stature of family members and analyzing growth trends for abrupt changes, among others. There are, however, various diseases and disorders that cause growth abnormalities.

Most notably, extreme height may be pathological, such as [[gigantism]] resulting from childhood hyperpituitarism, and [[dwarfism]] which has various causes. Rarely, no cause can be found for extreme height; very short persons may be termed as having [[idiopathic short stature]]. The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2003 approved hGH treatment for those 2.25 standard deviations below the population mean (approximately the lowest 1.2% of the population). An even rarer occurrence, or at least less used term and recognized "problem", is idiopathic tall stature.

If not enough [[growth hormone]] is produced and/or secreted by the pituitary gland, then a patient with growth hormone deficiency can undergo treatment. This treatment involves the injection of pure growth hormone into thick tissue to promote growth.

==Role of an individual's height==

===Height and health===

Studies show that there is a correlation between small stature &amp; a longer life expectancy. Individuals of small stature are also more likely to have lower blood pressure &amp; are less likely to acquire cancer. The University of Hawaii has found that the “longevity gene” FOXO3 that reduces the effects of aging is more commonly found in individuals of a small body size. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web. |title=‘Shorter men live longer, study shows‘|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140509110756.htm&lt;/ref&gt;Short stature decreases the risk of [[Chronic venous insufficiency|venous insufficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Tall height' |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000203.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain studies have shown that height is a factor in overall health while some suggest tallness is associated with better cardiovascular health and shortness with longevity.&lt;ref name="Samaras"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Samaras TT, Elrick H |title=Height, body size, and longevity: is smaller better for the humanbody? |journal=The Western Journal of Medicine |volume=176 |issue=3 |pages=206–8 |year=2002 |pmid=12016250 |pmc=1071721 |doi=10.1136/ewjm.176.3.206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cancer risk has also been found to grow with height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/07/21/height-cancer-risk.html | work=CBC News | title=Cancer risk may grow with height | date=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, modern westernized interpretations of the relationship between height and health fail to account for the observed height variations worldwide.&lt;ref name=cavalli&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., &amp; Cavalli-Sforza, F., 1995, ''The Great Human Diasporas'',&lt;/ref&gt;  Cavalli-Sforza and Cavalli-Sforza note that variations in height worldwide can be partly attributed to evolutionary pressures resulting from differing environments. These evolutionary pressures result in height related health implications.  While tallness is an adaptive benefit in colder climates such as found in Europe, shortness helps dissipate body heat in warmer climatic regions.&lt;ref name=cavalli /&gt;  Consequently, the relationships between health and height cannot be easily generalized since tallness and shortness can both provide health benefits in different environmental settings.

At the extreme end, being excessively tall can cause various medical problems, including cardiovascular problems, because of the increased load on the heart to supply the body with blood, and problems resulting from the increased time it takes the brain to communicate with the extremities. For example, [[Robert Pershing Wadlow|Robert Wadlow]], the tallest man known to verifiable history, developed trouble walking as his height increased throughout his life. In many of the pictures of the later portion of his life, Wadlow can be seen gripping something for support. Late in his life, although he died at age 22, he had to wear braces on his legs and walk with a cane; and he died after developing an infection in his legs because he was unable to feel the irritation and cutting caused by his leg braces.

Sources are in disagreement about the overall relationship between height and longevity. Samaras and Elrick, in the Western Journal of Medicine, demonstrate an inverse correlation between height and longevity in several mammals including humans.&lt;ref name="Samaras"/&gt;

Women whose height is under {{convert|150|cm|ftin|abbr=on}} may have a small [[human pelvis|pelvis]], resulting in such complications during [[childbirth]] as [[shoulder dystocia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Merck|title=Risk factors present before pregnancy|url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec22/ch258/ch258b.html|work=Merck Manual Home Edition|publisher=Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done in Sweden in 2005 has shown that there is a strong inverse correlation between height and suicide among Swedish men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Magnusson PK, Gunnell D, Tynelius P, Davey Smith G, Rasmussen F |title=Strong inverse association between height and suicide in a large cohort of Swedish men: evidence of early life origins of suicidal behavior? |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=7 |pages=1373–5 |year=2005 |pmid=15994722 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.7.1373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large body of human and animal evidence indicates that shorter, smaller bodies age slower, and have fewer chronic diseases and greater longevity. For example, a study found eight areas of support for the "smaller lives longer" thesis. These areas of evidence include studies involving longevity, life expectancy, centenarians, male vs. female longevity differences, mortality advantages of shorter people, survival findings, smaller body size due to calorie restriction, and within species body size differences. They all support the conclusion that smaller individuals live longer in healthy environments and with good nutrition. However, the difference in longevity is modest. Several human studies have found a loss of 0.5 year/centimeter of increased height (1.2 yr/inch). But these findings do not mean that all tall people die young. Many live to advanced ages and some become centenarians.&lt;ref&gt;Samaras TT 2014, Evidence from eight different types of studies showing smaller body size is related to greater longevity JSRR 3(16):2150-2160. 2014: article no. JSRR.2014.16.003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Height and occupational success===
{{see also|Heights of presidents and presidential candidates of the United States}}
There is a large body of research in psychology, economics, and [[human biology]] that has assessed the relationship between several seemingly innocuous physical features (e.g., body height) and occupational success.&lt;ref name="Stefan 2010 25–38"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Body height and occupational success for actors and actresses |first=Stieger |last=Stefan |first2=Burger |last2=Christoph |journal=Psychological Reports |volume=107 |pages=25–38 |year=2010 |doi=10.2466/pr0.107.1.25-38 |pmid=20923046 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correlation between height and success was explored decades ago.&lt;ref name="W.

In most occupational fields, body height is not relevant to how well people are able to perform; nonetheless several studies found that success was positively correlated with body height, although there may be other factors such as gender or socioeonomic status that are correlated with height which may account for the difference in success.&lt;ref name="Stefan 2010 25–38"/&gt;&lt;ref name="W.

The only exceptions of this rather uniform height distribution were people in the Anglo-Saxon settlement regions who were taller than the average and people from Southeast Asia with below-average heights.

The tallest living man is [[Sultan Kösen]] of [[Turkey]], at {{Height|cm=251}}. The tallest man in modern history was [[Robert Pershing Wadlow]] (1918–1940), from [[Illinois]], in the [[United States]], who was {{Height|cm=272}} at the time of his death. The tallest woman in medical history was [[Zeng Jinlian]] of [[Hunan]], China, who stood {{Height|cm=248}} when she died at the age of 17. The shortest adult human on record was [[Chandra Bahadur Dangi]] of [[Nepal]] at {{Height|cm=54.6}}.

Adult height between populations often differs significantly. For example, the average height of women from the Czech Republic is greater than that of men from Malawi. This may be caused by genetic differences, childhood lifestyle differences (nutrition, sleep patterns, physical labor), or both.

Depending on sex, genetic and environmental factors, shrinkage of stature may begin in middle age in some individuals but tends to be universal in the extremely aged. This decrease in height is due to such factors as decreased height of inter-vertebral discs because of [[desiccation]], [[atrophy]] of soft tissues and postural changes secondary to degenerative disease.

As with any statistical data, the accuracy of such data may be questionable for various reasons:

* Some studies may allow subjects to self-report values. Generally speaking, self-reported height tends to be taller than its measured height, although the overestimation of height depends on the reporting subject's height, age, gender and region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://eurpub.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/01/20/eurpub.ckp228.full|title=Self-reported and measured weight, height and body mass index (BMI) in Italy, the Netherlands and North America|author1=Arno J.

* Test subjects may have been invited instead of chosen at random, resulting in [[Selection bias#Sampling bias|sampling bias]].
* Some countries may have significant height gaps between different regions. For instance, one survey shows there is {{Height|cm=10.8}} gap between the tallest state and the shortest state in Germany.&lt;ref name="Germany"&gt;WWC Web World Center GmbH G.R.P.

Oktober 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Under such circumstances, the mean height may not represent the total population unless sample subjects are appropriately taken from all regions with using [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of the different regional groups. 
* Different social groups can show different mean height. According to a study in France, executives and professionals are {{Height|cm=2.6}} taller, and university students are {{Height|cm=2.55}} taller&lt;ref&gt;Although the mean height of university students are slightly shorter than the national mean height aged 20-29 in this study.&lt;/ref&gt; than the national average.&lt;ref name="insee.fr"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/ffc/docs_ffc/es361d.pdf |title=La taille des hommes: son incidence sur la vie en couple et la carrière professionnelle |doi=10.3406/estat.2003.7355|author=Herpin, Nicolas |journal=Économie et Statistique|year= 2003|volume=361|issue =1| pages =71–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As this case shows, data taken from a particular social group may not represent a total population in some countries.
* A relatively small sample of the population may have been measured, which makes it uncertain whether this sample accurately represents the entire population.
* The height of persons can vary over the course of a day, due to factors such as a height increase from exercise done directly before measurement (normally inversely correlated), or a height increase since lying down for a significant period of time (normally inversely correlated). For example, one study revealed a mean decrease of {{convert|1.54|cm|in}} in the heights of 100 children from getting out of bed in the morning to between 4 and 5 p.m. that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1545095 | pmid=568918 | volume=53 | title=Variations in height throughout the day | journal=Arch Dis Child | pages=762 | last1 = Buckler | first1 = JM | doi=10.1136/adc.53.9.762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such factors may not have been controlled in some of the studies.

In the Netherlands, about 35% of men have the genetic profile Y [[haplogroup I-M170]], but in Herzegovina, the frequency is over 70%. Extrapolating the genetic trend line suggests that the average Herzegovinian man could possibly be as tall as 190&amp;nbsp;cm (nearly 6′ 3″). Many Herzegovinians do not achieve this potential due to poverty (citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina were 1.9&amp;nbsp;cm taller if both of their parents went to university, which is considered as a wealth indicator) and to nutritional choices: [[Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork|religious prohibition on pork]] may be largely to blame for the shorter average stature of Muslim Herzegovinians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acsh.org/news/2017/04/12/move-over-dutch-men-herzegovinians-may-be-tallest-world-11122 "Move Over, Dutch Men.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5211">In [[computer science]], the '''Krauss matching wildcards algorithm''' is a [[pattern matching]] algorithm. Based on the [[wildcard character|wildcard syntax]] in common use, e.g. in the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[command-line interface]], the algorithm provides a non-[[Recursion|recursive]] mechanism for matching patterns in software applications, based on syntax simpler than that typically offered by [[regular expression]]s.

== History ==
The algorithm is based on a history of development, correctness and performance testing, and programmer feedback that began with an unsuccessful search for a reliable non-recursive algorithm for matching wildcards. An initial algorithm, implemented in a single while loop, quickly prompted comments from software developers, leading to improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Krauss| first=Kirk| title=Matching Wildcards: An Algorithm| publisher=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]| year=2008| url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/matching-wildcards-an-algorithm/210200888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing comments and suggestions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=wild card searching| publisher=alt.os.development| year=2008| url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.os.development/8-rIaarASu8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=T.J.| title=wild card matching in text string| year=2014| publisher=Stack Overflow| url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21409588/wild-card-matching-in-text-string}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminated in a revised algorithm still implemented in a single while loop but refined based on a collection of [[test case]]s and a [[profiling (computer programming)|performance profiler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Krauss| first=Kirk| title=Matching Wildcards: An Empirical Way to Tame an Algorithm| publisher=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]| year=2014| url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/matching-wildcards-an-empirical-way-to-t/240169123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience tuning the single while loop using the profiler prompted development of a two-loop strategy that achieved further performance gains, particularly in situations involving empty input strings or input containing no wildcard characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Krauss| first=Kirk| title=Matching Wildcards: An Improved Algorithm for Big Data| publisher=Develop for Performance| year=2018| url=http://www.developforperformance.com/MatchingWildcards_AnImprovedAlgorithmForBigData.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-loop algorithm is available for use by the [[open-source software]] development community, under the terms of the [[Apache License]] v. 2.0, and is accompanied by test case code.

== Usage ==
The algorithm made available under the Apache license is implemented in both [[Pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]-based [[C++]] and portable C++ (implemented without pointers). The test case code, also available under the Apache license, can be applied to any algorithm that provides the pattern matching operations below. The implementation as coded is unable to handle [[Variable-width encoding|multibyte character sets]] and poses problems when the text being searched may contain multiple incompatible character sets.

== Pattern matching operations ==
The algorithm supports three pattern matching operations:
* A one-to-one match is performed between the pattern and the source to be checked for a match, with the exception of asterisk ([[*]]) or question mark ([[?]]) characters in the pattern.
* An asterisk ([[*]]) character matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
* A question mark ([[?]]) character matches any single character.

== Examples ==
* ''*foo*''  	  matches any string containing "foo".
* ''mini*''       matches any string that begins with "mini" (including the string "mini" itself).
* ''???*''        matches any string of three or more letters.

== Applications ==
The original algorithm has been ported to the [[DataFlex]] programming language by Larry Heiges&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Data Access Worldwide Code Library| last=Heiges| first=Larry| title=Text compare function - generalTextCompare.txt| year=2008| url=https://support.dataaccess.com/Forums/showthread.php?1064-Text-compare-function-generalTextCompare-txt-(0-1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use with [[Visual DataFlex|Data Access Worldwide]] code library. It has been posted on GitHub in modified form as part of a log file reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Deniskore| work=Popular repositories| title=Deniskore/wildcard/CLogReader.cpp| publisher=GitHub| year=2013| url=https://github.com/Deniskore/wildcard/blob/master/CLogReader.cpp}} Lines 173-279.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 algorithm is part of the Unreal Model Viewer built into the Epic Games [[Unreal Engine]] [[game engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=gildor2| work=Unreal Engine Model Viewer (UE Viewer)| title=UModel/Core/Core.cpp| publisher=GitHub| year=2016| url=https://github.com/gildor2/UModel/blob/master/Core/Core.cpp}} Lines 334-435.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=gildor2| work=Unreal Engine Model Viewer (UE Viewer)| title=History for UModel/Core/Core.cpp| year=2016| url=https://github.com/gildor2/UModel/commits/master/Core/Core.cpp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3174">In [[statistics]] and [[decision theory]], '''kurtosis risk''' is the [[risk (statistics)|risk]] that results when a [[statistical model]] assumes the [[normal distribution]], but is applied to [[observation]]s that have a tendency to occasionally be much farther (in terms of number of standard deviations) from the average than is expected for a normal distribution.

Kurtosis risk applies to any [[kurtosis]]-related quantitative model that assumes the normal distribution for certain of its [[independent variable]]s when the latter may in fact have kurtosis much greater than does the normal distribution. Kurtosis risk is commonly referred to as "[[fat tail]]" risk. The "fat tail" metaphor explicitly describes the situation of having more observations at either extreme than the tails of the normal distribution would suggest; therefore, the tails are "fatter".

Ignoring kurtosis risk will cause any model to understate the risk of variables with high kurtosis. For instance, [[Long-Term Capital Management]], a [[hedge fund]] cofounded by [[Myron Scholes]], ignored kurtosis risk to its detriment. After four successful years, this hedge fund had to be bailed out by major investment banks in the late 1990s because it understated the kurtosis of many [[security (finance)|financial securities]] underlying the fund's own trading positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rashomon in Connecticut |last=Krugman |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Krugman |date=2 October 1998 |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1908 |publisher=Slate Magazine|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bailout of Long-Term Capital: A Bad Precedent? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 26, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/business/economy/28view.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benoit Mandelbrot]], a French mathematician, extensively researched this issue. He felt that the extensive reliance on the normal distribution for much of the body of modern finance and [[investment theory]] is a serious flaw of any related models including the [[Black–Scholes]] option model developed by Myron Scholes and [[Fischer Black]], and the [[capital asset pricing model]] developed by [[William F. Sharpe]]. Mandelbrot explained his views and alternative finance theory in his book: ''The (Mis)Behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward'' published on September 18, 1997.

{{Group theory sidebar}}

In [[Lie theory]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''lattice''' in a [[locally compact group]] is a [[discrete subgroup]] with the property that the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] has finite [[invariant measure]]. In the special case of subgroups of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, this amounts to the usual [[Lattice (group)|geometric notion of a lattice]] as a periodic subset of points, and both the algebraic structure of lattices and the geometry of the space of all lattices are relatively well understood.

The theory is particularly rich for lattices in semisimple Lie groups or more generally in [[semisimple algebraic group]]s over [[local field]]s. In particular there is a wealth of rigidity results in this setting, and a celebrated theorem of [[Grigori Margulis]] states that in most cases all lattices are obtained as [[arithmetic group]]s.

Lattices are also well-studied in some other classes of groups, in particular groups associated to [[Kac-Moody algebra]]s and automorphisms groups of regular [[Tree (mathematics)|trees]] (the latter are known as ''tree lattices'').

Lattices are of interest in many areas of mathematics: [[geometric group theory]] (as particularly nice examples of [[discrete group]]s), in [[differential geometry]] (through the construction of locally homogeneous manifolds), in number theory (through [[arithmetic group]]s), in [[ergodic theory]] (through the study of homogeneous [[Flow (mathematics)|flows]] on the quotient spaces) and in [[combinatorics]] (through the construction of [[Expander graph|expanding]] [[Cayley graph]]s and other combinatorial objects).

== Generalities on lattices ==

=== Informal discussion ===

Lattices are best thought of as discrete approximations of continuous groups (such as Lie groups). For example, it is intuitively clear that the subgroup &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z^n&lt;/math&gt; of integer vectors "looks like" the real vector space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; in some sense, while both groups are essentially different: one is [[Finitely generated group|finitely generated]] and [[countable]], while the other is not (as a group) and has the [[cardinality of the continuum]].

Rigorously defining the meaning of "approximation of a continuous group by a discrete subgroup" in the previous paragraph in order to get a notion generalising the example &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z^n \subset \mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt; is a matter of what it is designed to achieve. Maybe the most obvious idea is to say that a subgroup "approximates" a larger group is that the larger group can be covered by the translates of a "small" subset by all elements in the subgroups. In a locally compact topological group there are two immediately available notions of "small": topological (a [[Compact set|compact]], or [[relatively compact subset]]) or measure-theoretical (a subset of finite Haar measure). Note that since the Haar measure is a [[Borel measure]], in particular gives finite mass to compact subsets, the second definition is more inclusive. The definition of a lattice used in mathematics relies upon the second meaning (in particular to include such examples as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb Z) \subset \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt;) but the first also has its own interest (such lattices are called uniform).

=== Definition ===

Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a locally compact group and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; a discrete subgroup (this means that there exists a neighbourhood &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of the identity element &lt;math&gt;e_G&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \cap U = \{ e_G \}&lt;/math&gt;). Then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is called a lattice in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if in addition there exists a [[Borel measure]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; on the quotient space &lt;math&gt;G / \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; which is finite (i.e. &lt;math&gt; \mu(G / \Gamma) &lt; +\infty&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-invariant (meaning that for any &lt;math&gt;g \in G&lt;/math&gt; and any open subset &lt;math&gt; W \subset G / \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; the equality &lt;math&gt;\mu(gW) = \mu(W)&lt;/math&gt; is satisifed).

A slightly more sophisticated formulation is as follows: suppose in addition that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is unimodular, then since &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is discrete it is also unimodular and by general theorems there exists a unique &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-invariant Borel measure on &lt;math&gt;G / \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; up to scaling. Then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a lattice if and only if this measure is finite.

In the case of discrete subgroups this invariant measure coincides locally with the [[Haar measure]] and hence a discrete subgroup in a locally compact group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; being a lattice is equivalent to it having a fundamental domain (for the action on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; by left-translations) of finite volume for the Haar measure.

A lattice &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \subset G&lt;/math&gt; is called '''uniform''' when the quotient space &lt;math&gt;G/\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is compact (and ''non-uniform'' otherwise). Equivalently a discrete subgroup &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \subset G&lt;/math&gt; is a uniform lattice if and only if there exists a compact subset &lt;math&gt;C \subset G&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;G = \bigcup {}_{\gamma \in \Gamma} \, C\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. Note that if &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is any discrete subgroup in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;G/\Gamma&lt;/matH&gt; is compact then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is automatically a lattice in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

=== First examples ===

The fundamental, and simplest, example is the subgroup &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z^n&lt;/math&gt; which is a lattice in the Lie group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;. A slightly more complicated example is given by the discrete [[Heisenberg group]] inside the continuous Heisenberg group.

If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a discrete group then a lattice in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is exactly a subgroup &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; of finite index (i.e. the quotient set &lt;math&gt;G/\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is finite).

All of these examples are uniform. A non-uniform example is given by the [[modular group]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)&lt;/math&gt; inside &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt;, and also by the higher-dimensional analogues &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb Z) \subset \mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt;.

Any finite-index subgroup of a lattice is also a lattice in the same group. More generally, a subgroup [[commensurability (group theory)|commensurable]] to a lattice is a lattice.

=== Which groups have lattices? ===

Not every locally compact group contains a lattice, and there is no general group-theoretical sufficient condition for this. On the other hand, there are plenty of more specific settings where such criteria exist. For example, the existence or non-existence of lattices in [[Lie group]]s is a well-understood topic.

As we mentioned, a necessary condition for a group to contain a lattice is that the group must be [[Unimodular group|unimodular]]. This allows for the easy construction of groups without lattices, for example the group of invertible [[Upper triangular matrix|upper triangular matrices]] or the [[affine group]]s. It is also not very hard to find unimodular groups without lattices, for example certain nilpotent Lie groups as explained below.

A stronger condition than unimodularity is [[Simple group|simplicity]]. This is sufficient to imply the existence of a lattice in a Lie group, but in the more general setting of locally compact groups there exists simple groups without lattices, for example the "Neretin groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ref=BCGM | last1=Bader | first1=Uri | first2=Pierre-Emmanuel | last2=Caprace | first3=Tsachik | last3=Gelander | first4=Shahar | last4=Mozes| title=Simple groups without lattices|  journal=Bull. London Math. Soc.| volume=44 | pages=55 | date=2012| arxiv=1008.2911 | mr=2881324 | doi=10.1112/blms/bdr061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lattices in solvable Lie groups ==

=== Nilpotent Lie groups ===

For nilpotent groups the theory simplifies much from the general case, and stays similar to the case of Abelian groups. All lattices in a nilpotent Lie group are uniform, and if &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a connected [[simply connected]] Lie group (equivalently it does not contain a nontrivial compact subgroup) then a discrete subgroup is a lattice if and only if it is not contained in a proper connected subgroup{{sfn|Raghunathan|1972|loc=Theorem 2.1}} (this generalises the fact that a discrete subgroup in a vector space is a lattice if and only if it spans the vector space).

A nilpotent Lie group contains a lattice if and only if it can be defined over the rationals, that is if and only if its [[structure constants]] are rational numbers.{{sfn|Raghunathan|1972|loc=Theorem 2.12}} More precisely, in a nilpotent group satisfying this condition lattices correspond via the exponential map to lattices (in the more elementary sense of [[Lattice (group)]]) in the Lie algebra.

A lattice in a nilpotent Lie group &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is always [[Finitely generated group|finitely generated]] (and hence [[Finitely presented group|finitely presented]] since it is itself nilpotent); in fact it is generated by at most &lt;math&gt;\dim(N)&lt;/math&gt; elements.{{sfn|Raghunathan|1972|loc=Theorem 2.21}}

Finally, a nilpotent group is isomorphic to a lattice in a nilpotent Lie group if and only if it contains a subgroup of finite index which is torsion-free and of finitely generated.

=== The general case ===

The criterion for nilpotent Lie groups to have a lattice given above does not apply to more general solvable Lie groups. It remains true that any lattice in a solvable Lie group is uniform{{sfn|Raghunathan|1972|loc=Theorem 3.1}} and that lattices in solvable groups are finitely presented.

Not all finitely generated solvable groups are lattices in a Lie group. An algebraic criterion is that the group be [[Polycyclic group|polycyclic]].{{sfn|Raghunathan|1972|loc=Theorem 4.28}}

== Lattices in semisimple Lie groups ==

=== Arithmetic groups and existence of lattices ===
{{Main | Arithmetic group}}

If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a semisimple [[linear algebraic group]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt; which is defined over the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt; of [[rational number]]s (i.e. the polynomial equations defining &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; have their coefficients in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt;) then it has a subgroup &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = G \cap \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb Z)&lt;/math&gt;. A fundamental theorem of [[Armand Borel]] and [[Harish-Chandra]] states that &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is always a lattice in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;; the simplest example of this is the subgroup &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb Z) \subset \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt;.

Generalising the construction above one gets the notion of an ''arithmetic lattice'' in a semisimple Lie group. Since all semisimple Lie groups can be defined over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q&lt;/math&gt; a consequence of the arithmetic construction is that any semisimple Lie group contains a lattice.

=== Irreducibility ===

When the Lie group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; splits as a product &lt;math&gt;G = G_1 \times G_2&lt;/math&gt; there is an obvious construction of lattices in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; from the smaller groups: if &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1 \subset G_1, \Gamma_2 \subset G_2&lt;/math&gt; are lattices then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1 \times \Gamma_2 \subset G&lt;/math&gt; is a lattice as well. Roughly, a lattice is then said to be ''irreducible'' if it does not come from this construction.

More formally, if &lt;math&gt;G = G_1 \times \ldots \times G_r&lt;/math&gt; is the decomposition of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; into simple factors, a lattice &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \subset G&lt;/math&gt; is said to be irreducible if either of the following equivalent conditions hold: 
*The projection of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; to any factor &lt;math&gt;G_{i_1} \times \ldots \times G_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; is dense;
*The intersection of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; with any factor &lt;math&gt;G_{i_1} \times \ldots \times G_{i_k}&lt;/math&gt; is not a lattice.

An example of an irreducible lattice is given by the subgroup &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb Z[\sqrt 2])&lt;/math&gt; which we view as a subgroup &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb R) \times \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt; via the map &lt;math&gt;g \mapsto (g, \sigma(g))&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the Galois map sending a matric with coefficients &lt;math&gt;a_i+b_i\sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;matH&gt;a_i - b_i \sqrt 2&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Rank 1 versus higher rank ===

The [[Algebraic torus#Flat subspaces and rank of symmetric spaces|real rank]] of a Lie group is the maximal dimension of an abelian subgroup containing only [[Semi-simple operator|semisimple]] elements. The semisimple Lie groups of real rank 1 without compact factors are (up to [[isogeny]]) those in the following list (see [[List of simple Lie groups]]):

*The [[orthogonal group]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SO}(n,1)&lt;/math&gt; of [[Quadratic form#Real quadratic form|real quadratic form]]s of signature &lt;math&gt;(n, 1)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;;
*The [[unitary group]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SU}(n,1)&lt;/math&gt; of [[Sesquilinear form#Hermitian form|Hermitian form]]s of signature &lt;math&gt;(n, 1)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;;
*The groups &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Sp}(n,1)&lt;/math&gt; (groups of matrices with [[quaternion]] coefficients which preserve a "quaternionic quadratic form" of signature &lt;math&gt;(n, 1)&lt;/math&gt;) for &lt;math&gt;n \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;;
*The [[exceptional Lie group]] &lt;math&gt;F_4^{-20}&lt;/math&gt; (the real form of rank 1 corresponding to the exceptional Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;F_4&lt;/math&gt;).

The real rank of a Lie group has a significant influence on the behaviour of the lattices it contains. In particularn the behaviour of lattices in the first two families of groups (and to a lesser extent that of lattices in the latter two) differs much from that of irreducible lattices in groups of higher rank. For example:

*There exists non-arithmetic lattices in all groups &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SO}(n,1)&lt;/math&gt;, in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SU}(2,1),\mathrm{SU}(3,1)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| ref=GPS | first1 = Misha | last1=Gromov | first2 = Ilya | last2=Piatetski-Shapiro | title=Nonarithmetic groups in Lobachevsky spaces | journal=Pub.

=== Kazhdan's property (T) ===

The property known as (T) was introduced by Kazhdan to study the algebraic structure lattices in certain Lie groups when the classical, more geometric methods failed or at least were not as efficient. The fundamental result when studying lattices is the following:{{sfn|Witte-Morris|2015|loc=Proposition 13.17}}

:''A lattice in a locally compact group has property (T) if and only if the group itself has property (T). ''

Using [[harmonic analysis]] it is possible to classify semisimple Lie groups according to whether or not they have the property. As a consequence we get the following result, further illustrating the dichotomy of the previous section:

*Lattices in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SO}(n,1), \mathrm{SU}(n,1)&lt;/math&gt; do not have Kazhdan's property (T) while irreducible lattices in all other simple Lie groups do;

=== Finiteness properties ===

Lattices in semisimple Lie groups are always finitely presented. For uniform lattices this is a direct consequence of cocompactness. In the non-uniform case this can be proved using reduction theory.{{sfn|Witte-Morris|2015|loc=Chapter 19}} However a much faster proof is by using [[Kazhdan's property (T)]] when possible.

== Riemannian manifolds associated to lattices in Lie groups ==

=== Left-invariant metrics ===

If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a Lie group then from an [[inner product]] &lt;math&gt;g_e&lt;/math&gt; on the tangent space &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; (the Lie algebra of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;) one can construct a [[Riemannian metric]] on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; as follows: if &lt;math&gt;v, w&lt;/math&gt; belong to the tangent space at a point &lt;math&gt;\gamma \in G&lt;/math&gt; put &lt;math&gt;g_\gamma(v, w) = g_e(\gamma^*v, \gamma^*w)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\gamma^*&lt;/math&gt; indicates the [[tangent map]] (at &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;) of the diffeomorphism &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto \gamma^{-1}x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

The maps &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto \gamma x &lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\gamma \in G&lt;/math&gt; are by definition isometries for this metric &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is any discrete subgroup in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (so that it acts [[Free action|freely]] and [[Properly discontinuous action|properly discontinuously]] by left-translations on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;) the quotient &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \backslash G&lt;/math&gt; is a Riemannian manifold locally isometric to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with the metric &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Riemannian volume form]] associated to &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/Math&gt; defines a Haar measure on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and we see that the quotient manifold is of finite Riemannian volume if and only if &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a lattice.

Interesting examples in this class of Riemannian spaces include compact [[flat manifold]]s and [[nilmanifold]]s.

=== Locally symmetric spaces ===
{{Main | Symmetric space}}

A natural inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[Killing form]]. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is not compact it is not definite and hence not an inner product: however when &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is semisimple and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal compact subgroup it can be used to define a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-invariant metric on the [[homogeneous space]] &lt;math&gt;X = G/K&lt;/math&gt;: such Riemannian manifolds are called [[symmetric spaces]] of non-compact type without Euclidean factors.

A subgroup &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \subset G&lt;/math&gt; acts freely, properly discontinuously on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is discrete and torsion-free. The quotients &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \backslash X&lt;/math&gt; are called locally symmetric spaces. There is thus a bijective correspondence between complete locally symmetric spaces locally isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and of finite Riemannian volume, and torsion-free lattices in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. This correspondence can be extended to all lattices by adding [[orbifold]]s on the geometric side.

== Lattices in p-adic Lie groups ==

A class of groups with similar properties (with respect to lattices) to real semisimple Lie groups are semisimple algebraic groups over local fields of characteristic 0, for example the [[p-adic field]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q_p&lt;/math&gt;. There is an arithmetic construction similar to the real case, and the dichotomy between higher rank and rank one also holds in this case, in a more marked form. Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be an algebraic group over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q_p&lt;/math&gt; of split-&lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q_p&lt;/math&gt;-rank ''r''. Then:

*If ''r'' is at least 2 all irreducible lattices in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are arithmetic;
*if ''r=1'' then there are uncountably many commensurability classes of non-arithmetic lattices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | ref=LubGAFA | last=Lubotzky | first=Alexander | title=Lattices in rank one Lie groups over local fields | journal=Geom. Funct. Anal. | volume=1 | issue=4 | date=1991 | pages=406–431 | mr=1132296 | doi=10.1007/BF01895641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter case all lattices are in fact free groups (up to finite index).

=== S-arithmetic groups ===

More generally one can look at lattices in groups of the form

:&lt;math&gt;G = \prod_{p \in S} G_p &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G_p&lt;/math&gt; is a semisimple algebraic group over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Q_p&lt;/math&gt;. Usually &lt;math&gt;p=\infty&lt;/math&gt; is allowed, in which case &lt;math&gt;G_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is a real Lie group. An example of such a lattice is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2 \left( \mathbb Z \left[\frac 1 p \right] \right) \subset \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb R) \times \mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb Q_p)&lt;/math&gt;.

This arithmetic construction can be generalised to obtain the notion of an ''S-arithmetic group''. The Margulis arithmeticity theorem applies to this setting as well. In particular, if at least two of the factors &lt;math&gt;G_p&lt;/math&gt; are noncompact then any irreducible lattice in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is S-arithmetic.

=== Lattices in adelic groups ===

If &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G&lt;/math&gt; is a semisimple algebraic group over a [[number field]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb A&lt;/math&gt; its [[Ring of adeles|adèle ring]] then the group &lt;math&gt;G = \mathrm G(\mathbb A)&lt;/math&gt; of adélic points is well-defined (modulo some technicalities) and it is a locally compact group which naturally contains the group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G(F)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-rational point as a discrete subgroup. The Borel&amp;ndash;Harish-Chandra theorem extends to this setting, and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G(F) \subset \mathrm G(\mathbb A)&lt;/math&gt; is a lattice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | ref=Weil | last=Weil | first=André | title=Adeles and algebraic groups. With appendices by M. Demazure and Takashi Ono | series=Progress in Mathematics | volume=23 | publisher=Birkhäuser | year=1982 | pages=iii+126 | isbn=3-7643-3092-9 | mr=0670072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[strong approximation theorem]] relates the quotient &lt;math&gt;\mathrm G(F) \backslash \mathrm G(\mathbb A)&lt;/math&gt; to more classical S-arithmetic quotients. This fact makes the adèle groups very effective as tools in the theory of [[automorphic form]]s. In particular modern forms of the [[Arthur-Selberg trace formula|trace formula]] are usually stated and proven for adélic groups rather than for Lie groups.

== Rigidity ==

=== Rigidity results ===

Another group of phenomena concerning lattices in semisimple algebraic groups is collectively known as ''rigidity''. Here are three classical examples of results in this category.

[[Local rigidity]] results state that in most situations every subgroup which is sufficiently "close" to a lattice (in the intuitive sense, formalised by [[Chabauty topology]]) is actually conjugated to the original lattice by an element of the ambient Lie group. A consequence of local rigidity and the [[Kazhdan-Margulis theorem]] is Wang's theorem: in a given group (with a fixed Haar measure), for any ''v&gt;0'' there are only finitely many (up to conjugation) lattices with covolume bounded by ''v''.

The [[Mostow rigidity theorem]] states that for lattices in simple Lie groups not locally isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt; (the group of 2 by 2 matrices with determinant 1) any isomorphism of lattices is essentially induced by an isomorphism between the groups themselves. In particular, a lattice in a Lie group "remembers" the ambient Lie group through its group structure. The first statement is sometimes called ''strong rigidity'' and is due to [[George Mostow]] and [[Gopal Prasad]] (Mostow proved it for cocompact lattices and Prasad extended it to the general case).

''[[Superrigidity]]'' provides (for Lie groups and algebraic groups over local fields of higher rank) a generalization dealing with homomorphisms from a lattice in an algebraic group ''G'' into another algebraic group ''H''. It was proven by Grigori Margulis and is an essential ingredient in the proof of his arithmeticity theorem.

=== Nonrigidity in low dimensions ===

The only groups for which Mostow rigidity does not hold are all groups locally isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt;. In this case there are in fact continuously many lattices and they give rise to [[Teichmüller space]]s.

Nonuniform lattices in the group &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb C)&lt;/math&gt; are not locally rigid. In fact they are accumulation points (in the Chabauty topology) of lattices of smaller covolume, as demonstrated by [[hyperbolic Dehn surgery]].

As lattices in rank-one p-adic groups are virtually free groups they are very non-rigid.

== Tree lattices ==

=== Definition ===

Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a tree with a cocompact group of automorphisms; for example, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; can be a [[Regular graph|regular]] or [[Biregular graph|biregular]] tree. The group of automorphisms&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(T)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a locally compact group (when endowed with the [[compact-open topology]], in which a basis of neighbourhoods of the identity is given by the stabilsers of finite subtrees, which are compact). Any group which is a lattice in some &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(T)&lt;/math&gt; is then called a ''tree lattice''.

The discreteness in this case is easy to see from the group action on the tree: a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(T)&lt;/math&gt; is discrete if and only if all vertex stabilisers are finite groups.

It is easily seen from the basic theory of group actions on trees that uniform tree lattices are virtually free groups. Thus the more interesting tree lattices are the non-uniform ones, equivalently those for which the quotient graph &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \backslash T&lt;/math&gt; is infinite. The existence of such lattices is not easy to see.

=== Tree lattices from algebraic groups ===

If &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a local field of positive characteristic (i.e. a completion of a [[Function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of a curve over a finite field, for example the field of formal [[Laurent polynomial|Laurent]] [[power serie]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathbb F_p((t))&lt;/math&gt;) and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; an algebraic group defined over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;-split rank one, then any lattice in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a tree lattice through its action on the [[Bruhat-Tits building]] which in this case is a tree. In contrast to the characteristic 0 case such lattices can be nonuniform, and in this case they are never finitely generated.

=== Tree lattices from Bass-Serre theory ===
{{Main | Bass-Serre theory}}

If &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the fundamental group of an infinite [[graph of groups]], all of whose vertex groups are finite, and under additional necessary assumptions on the index of the edge groups and the size of the vertex groups, then the action of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; on the Bass-Serre tree associated to the graph of groups realises it as a tree lattice.

=== Existence criterion ===

More generally one can ask the following question: if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Aut}(T)&lt;/math&gt;, under which conditions does &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/mat&gt;H&lt;/matH&gt; contain a lattice? The existence of a uniform lattice is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; being unimodular and the quotient &lt;math&gt;H \backslash T&lt;/math&gt; being finite. The general existence theorem is more subtle: it is necessary and sufficient that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be unimodular, and that the quotient &lt;math&gt;H \backslash T&lt;/math&gt; be of "finite volume" in a suitable sense (which can be expressed combinatorially in terms of the action of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;), more general than the stroger condition that the quotient be finite (as proven by the very existence of nonuniform tree lattices).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10153">{{distinguish|Coordinate lines}}
In [[geometry]], '''line coordinates''' are used to specify the position of a [[Line (geometry)|line]] just as point coordinates (or simply [[Coordinate system|coordinates]]) are used to specify the position of a point.

==Lines in the plane==
There are several possible ways to specify the position of a line in the plane. A simple way is by the pair {{nowrap|(''m'', ''b'')}} where the equation of the line is ''y''&amp;nbsp;= ''mx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''. Here ''m'' is the [[slope]] and ''b'' is the [[y-intercept|''y''-intercept]]. This system specifies coordinates for all lines that are not vertical. However, it is more common and simpler algebraically to use coordinates {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'')}} where the equation of the line is ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. This system specifies coordinates for all lines except those that pass through the origin. The geometrical interpretations of ''l'' and ''m'' are the negative reciprocals of the ''x'' and [[y-intercept|''y''-intercept]] respectively.

The exclusion of lines passing through the origin can be resolved by using a system of three coordinates {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'', ''n'')}} to specify the line in which the equation, ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Here ''l'' and ''m'' may not both be 0. In this equation, only the ratios between ''l'', ''m'' and ''n'' are significant, in other words if the coordinates are multiplied by a non-zero scalar then line represented remains the same. So {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'', ''n'')}} is a system of [[homogeneous coordinates]] for the line.

If points in the [[real projective plane]] are represented by homogeneous coordinates {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}}, the equation of the line is ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''nz''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, provided {{nowrap|(''l'', ''m'', ''n'') ≠ (0,0,0) .}} In particular, line coordinate {{nowrap|(0, 0, 1)}} represents the line ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, which is the [[line at infinity]] in the [[projective plane]]. Line coordinates {{nowrap|(0, 1, 0)}} and {{nowrap|(1, 0, 0)}} represent the ''x'' and ''y''-axes respectively.

==Tangential equations==
Just as ''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 can represent a [[curve]] as a subset of the points in the plane, the equation φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 represents a subset of the lines on the plane. The set of lines on the plane may, in an abstract sense, be thought of as the set of points in a projective plane, the [[Duality (projective geometry)|dual]] of the original plane. The equation φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 then represents a curve in the dual plane. 

For a curve ''f''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 in the plane, the [[tangent]]s to the curve form a curve in the dual space called the [[dual curve]]. If φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is the equation of the dual curve, then it is called the '''tangential equation''', for the original curve. A given equation φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 represents a curve in the original plane determined as the [[Envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of the lines that satisfy this equation. Similarly, if φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') is a [[homogeneous function]] then φ(''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 represents a curve in the dual space given in homogeneous coordinates, and may be called the homogeneous tangential equation of the enveloped curve.

Tangential equations are useful in the study of curves defined as envelopes, just as Cartesian equations are useful in the study of curves defined as loci.

==Tangential equation of a point==
A linear equation in line coordinates has the form ''al''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bm''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, where ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are constants. Suppose (''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'') is a line that satisfies this equation. If ''c'' is not 0 then ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, where ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''/''c'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''b''/''c'', so every line satisfying the original equation passes though the point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''). Conversely, any line through (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') satisfies the original equation, so ''al''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bm''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is the equation of set of lines through (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''). For a given point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''), the equation of the set of lines though it is ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, so this may be defined as the tangential equation of the point. Similarly, for a point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'') given in homogeneous coordinates, the equation of the point in homogeneous tangential coordinates is ''lx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''my''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''nz''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

==Formulas==
The intersection of the lines (''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is the solution to the linear equations 

:&lt;math&gt;l_1x+m_1y+1=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;l_2x+m_2y+1=0.&lt;/math&gt;

By [[Cramer's rule]], the solution is

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{m_1-m_2}{l_1m_2-l_2m_1},\,y=-\frac{l_1-l_2}{l_1m_2-l_2m_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The lines (''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), (''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and (''l''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are [[Concurrent lines|concurrent]] when the [[determinant]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
  l_1 &amp; m_1 &amp; 1 \\
  l_2 &amp; m_2 &amp; 1 \\
  l_3 &amp; m_3 &amp; 1
\end{vmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

For homogeneous coordinates, the intersection of the lines (''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is

:&lt;math&gt;(m_1n_2-m_2n_1,\,l_2n_1-l_1n_2,\,l_1m_2-l_2m_1).&lt;/math&gt;

The lines (''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), (''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''l''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''m''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''n''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are [[Concurrent lines|concurrent]] when the [[determinant]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
  l_1 &amp; m_1 &amp; n_1 \\
  l_2 &amp; m_2 &amp; n_2 \\
  l_3 &amp; m_3 &amp; n_3
\end{vmatrix}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Dually, the coordinates of the line containing (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are
:&lt;math&gt;(y_1z_2-y_2z_1,\,x_2z_1-x_1z_2,\,x_1y_2-x_2y_1).&lt;/math&gt;

==Lines in three-dimensional space==
{{main|Plücker coordinates}}
For two given points in the [[real projective plane]], (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the three determinants

:&lt;math&gt;y_1z_2-y_2z_1,\,x_2z_1-x_1z_2,\,x_1y_2-x_2y_1&lt;/math&gt;

determine the [[projective line]] containing them.

Similarly, for two points in '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,  (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''w''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the line containing them is determined by the six determinants 

:&lt;math&gt;x_1y_2-x_2y_1,\,x_1z_2-x_1z_2,\,y_1z_2-y_2z_1,\,x_1w_2-x_2w_1,\,y_1w_2-y_2w_1,\,z_1w_2-z_2w_1.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the basis for a system of homogeneous line coordinates in three-dimensional space called ''Plücker coordinates''. Six numbers in a set of coordinates only represent a line when they satisfy an additional equation. This system maps the space of lines in three-dimensional space to [[projective space]] '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, but with the additional requirement the space of lines corresponds to the [[Klein quadric]], which is a [[manifold]] of dimension four.

More generally, the lines in ''n''-dimensional projective space are determined by a system of ''n''(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)/2 homogeneous coordinates that satisfy a set of (''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;3)/2 conditions, resulting in a manifold of dimension&amp;nbsp;2(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1).

==With complex numbers==
[[Isaak Yaglom]] has shown&lt;ref name=Yaglom68&gt;[[Isaak Yaglom]] (1968) ''Complex Numbers in Geometry'', [[Academic Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; how [[dual number]]s provide coordinates for oriented lines in the Euclidean plane, and [[split-complex number]]s form line coordinates for the [[hyperbolic plane]]. The coordinates depend on the presence of an origin and reference line on it. Then, given an arbitrary line its coordinates are found from the intersection with the reference line. The distance ''s'' from the origin to the intersection and the angle &amp;theta; of inclination between the two lines are used:
:&lt;math&gt;z = (\tan \frac {\theta}{2}) (1 + s \epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; is the dual number&lt;ref name=Yaglom68/&gt;{{rp|81}} for a Euclidean line, and

:&lt;math&gt;z = (\tan \frac {\theta}{2}) (\cosh s + j \sinh s)&lt;/math&gt; is the split-complex number&lt;ref name=Yaglom68/&gt;{{rp|118}} for a line in the Lobachevski plane.

Since there are lines ultraparallel to the reference line in the Lobachevski plane, they need coordinates too: There is a unique [[ultraparallel theorem|common perpendicular]], say ''s'' is the distance from the origin to this perpendicular, and ''d'' is the length of the segment between reference and the given line.
:&lt;math&gt;z = (\tanh \frac {d}{2}) (\sinh s + j \cosh s)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ultraparallel line.&lt;ref name=Yaglom68/&gt;{{rp|118}}

The motions of the line geometry are described with [[linear fractional transformation]]s on the appropriate complex planes.&lt;ref name=Yaglom68/&gt;{{rp|87,123}}

In the mathematical theory of [[Random matrix|random matrices]], the '''Marchenko–Pastur distribution''', or '''Marchenko–Pastur law''', describes the [[asymptotic]] behavior of [[singular value]]s of large rectangular [[random matrix|random matrices]].  The theorem is named after [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[mathematicians]] [[Vladimir Marchenko]] and [[Leonid Pastur]] who proved this result in 1967.

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; denotes a &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; random matrix whose entries are independent identically distributed random variables with mean 0 and variance  &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, let

: &lt;math&gt;Y_n =  \frac{1}{n}X X^T &lt;/math&gt;

and let &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,\, \lambda_2, \,\dots,\, \lambda_m&lt;/math&gt; be the [[eigenvalue]]s of &lt;math&gt;Y_n&lt;/math&gt; (viewed as [[random variable]]s).  Finally, consider the random measure

: &lt;math&gt;\mu_m (A) = \frac{1}{m} \# \left\{ \lambda_j \in A \right\}, \quad A \subset \mathbb{R}. &lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem'''.  Assume that &lt;math&gt;m,\,n \,\to\, \infty&lt;/math&gt; so that the ratio &lt;math&gt;m/n \,\to\, \lambda \in (0, +\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.  Then &lt;math&gt;\mu_{m} \,\to\, \mu&lt;/math&gt; (in [[Weak_topology#The_weak-.2A_topology|weak* topology]] in [[Convergence_in_distribution#Convergence_in_distribution|distribution]]), where
: &lt;math&gt;\mu(A) =\begin{cases} (1-\frac{1}{\lambda}) \mathbf{1}_{0\in A} + \nu(A),&amp; \text{if } \lambda &gt;1\\
\nu(A),&amp; \text{if } 0\leq \lambda \leq 1,
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;d\nu(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi \sigma^2 } \frac{\sqrt{(\lambda_{+} - x)(x - \lambda_{-})}}{\lambda x} \,\mathbf{1}_{[\lambda_{-}, \lambda_{+}]}\, dx&lt;/math&gt;
with
: &lt;math&gt; \lambda_{\pm} = \sigma^2(1 \pm \sqrt{\lambda})^2. &lt;/math&gt;

The Marchenko–Pastur law also arises as the [[free Poisson law]] in free probability theory, having rate &lt;math&gt;1/\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and jump size &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], the '''McKay graph''' of a finite-dimensional representation ''V'' of a finite [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' is a weighted [[quiver (mathematics)|quiver]] encoding the structure of the [[representation theory]] of ''G''. Each node represents an irreducible representation of ''G''. If &lt;math&gt;\chi_i, \chi_j&lt;/math&gt; are irreducible representations of ''G'' then there is an arrow from &lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\chi_j&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\chi_j&lt;/math&gt; is a constituent of the [[tensor product]] &lt;math&gt;V\otimes\chi_i&lt;/math&gt;. Then the weight ''n&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the arrow is the number of times this constituent appears in &lt;math&gt;V \otimes\chi_i&lt;/math&gt;. For finite subgroups ''H'' of GL(2, '''C'''), the McKay graph of ''H'' is the McKay graph of the canonical representation of ''H''.

If ''G'' has ''n'' irreducible characters, then the [[Cartan matrix]] ''c&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the representation ''V'' of dimension ''d'' is defined by &lt;math&gt; c_V = (d\delta_{ij} -n_{ij})_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;, where δ is the [[Kronecker delta]]. A result by Steinberg states that if ''g'' is a representative of a [[conjugacy class]] of ''G'', then the vectors &lt;math&gt; ((\chi_i(g))_i &lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvectors of ''c&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the eigenvalues &lt;math&gt; d-\chi_V(g) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \chi_V &lt;/math&gt; is the character of the representation ''V''.

The McKay correspondence, named after [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]], states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the McKay graphs of the finite subgroups of SL(2, '''C''') and the extended [[Dynkin diagram]]s, which appear in the [[ADE classification]] of the simple [[Lie Algebra]]s.

==Definition==
Let ''G'' be a finite group, ''V'' be a [[Group representation|representation]] of ''G'' and &lt;math&gt; \chi &lt;/math&gt; be its character. Let &lt;math&gt;\{\chi_1,\ldots,\chi_d\}&lt;/math&gt; be the irreducible representations of ''G''. If

:&lt;math&gt;	V\otimes\chi_i = \sum_j n_{ij} \chi_j,&lt;/math&gt;

then define the McKay graph &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_G&lt;/math&gt; of ''G'' as follows:

* To each irreducible representation of ''G'' corresponds a node in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_G&lt;/math&gt;.
* There is an arrow from &lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\chi_j&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''n&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0 and ''n&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the weight of the arrow: &lt;math&gt;\chi_i\xrightarrow{n_{ij}}\chi_j&lt;/math&gt;.
* If ''n&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''n&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;'', then we put an edge between &lt;math&gt; \chi_i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \chi_j &lt;/math&gt; instead of a double arrow. Moreover, if ''n&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1, then we do not write the weight of the corresponding arrow.

We can calculate the value of ''n&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' by considering the inner product. We have the following formula: 

:&lt;math&gt;n_{ij} = \langle V\otimes\chi_i, \chi_j\rangle = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G} V(g)\chi_i(g)\overline{\chi_j(g)},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[inner product]] of the [[character (mathematics)|character]]s.

The McKay graph of a finite subgroup of GL(2, '''C''') is defined to be the McKay graph of its canonical representation. 

For finite subgroups of SL(2, '''C'''), the canonical representation is self-dual, so ''n&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''n&lt;sub&gt;ji&lt;/sub&gt;'' for all ''i'', ''j''. Thus, the McKay graph of finite subgroups of SL(2, '''C''') is undirected. 

In fact, by the McKay correspondence, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the finite subgroups of SL(2, '''C''') and the extended Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams of type A-D-E. 

We define the Cartan matrix ''c&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''V'' as follows: 

:&lt;math&gt;c_V = (d\delta_{ij} - n_{ij})_{ij},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \delta_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]].

==Some results==
* If the representation ''V'' of a finite group ''G'' is faithful, then the McKay graph of ''V'' is connected.
* The McKay graph of a finite subgroup of SL(2, '''C''') has no self-loops, that is, ''n&lt;sub&gt;ii&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0 for all ''i''.
* The weights of the arrows of the McKay graph of a finite subgroup of SL(2, '''C''') are always less or equal than one.

==Examples==
*Suppose ''G'' = ''A'' × ''B'', and there are canonical irreducible representations ''c&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''c&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''A'' and ''B'' respectively. If &lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt;, ''i'' = 1, ..., ''k'', are the irreducible representations of ''A'' and &lt;math&gt;\psi_j&lt;/math&gt;, ''j'' = 1, ..., ''ℓ'', are the irreducible representations of ''B'', then

:: &lt;math&gt;\chi_i\times\psi_j\quad 1\leq i \leq k,\,\, 1\leq j \leq \ell&lt;/math&gt;

: are the irreducible representations of &lt;math&gt;A\times B&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\chi_i\times\psi_j(a,b) = \chi_i(a)\psi_j(b), (a,b)\in A\times B&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, we have 

::&lt;math&gt;\langle (c_A\times c_B)\otimes (\chi_i\times\psi_\ell), \chi_n\times\psi_p\rangle = \langle c_A\otimes \chi_k, \chi_n\rangle\cdot \langle c_B\otimes \psi_\ell, \psi_p\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

: Therefore, there is an arrow in the McKay graph of ''G'' between &lt;math&gt;\chi_i\times\psi_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\chi_k\times\psi_\ell&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is an arrow in the McKay graph of ''A'' between &lt;math&gt;\chi_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\chi_k&lt;/math&gt; and there is an arrow in the McKay graph of ''B'' between &lt;math&gt;\psi_j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi_\ell&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the weight on the arrow in the McKay graph of ''G'' is the product of the weights of the two corresponding arrows in the McKay graphs of ''A'' and ''B''.

* [[Felix Klein]] proved that the finite subgroups of SL(2, '''C''') are the binary polyhedral groups. The McKay correspondence states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the McKay graphs of these binary polyhedral groups and the extended Dynkin diagrams. For example, let &lt;math&gt;\overline{T}&lt;/math&gt; be the [[binary tetrahedral group]]. Every finite subgroup of SL(2, '''C''') is conjugate to a finite subgroup of SU(2, '''C'''). Consider the matrices in SU(2, '''C'''):

::&lt;math&gt;
S = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
i &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -i \end{array} \right) , 
V = \left( \begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; i \\
i &amp; 0 \end{array} \right), 
U = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \begin{array}{cc}
\varepsilon &amp; \varepsilon^3 \\
\varepsilon &amp; \varepsilon^7 \end{array} \right),
&lt;/math&gt;

: where ''ε'' is a primitive eighth root of unity. Then, &lt;math&gt;\overline{T}&lt;/math&gt; is generated by ''S'', ''U'', ''V''. In fact, we have 

::&lt;math&gt;\overline{T} = \{U^k, SU^k,VU^k,SVU^k \mid k = 0,\ldots, 5\}.&lt;/math&gt;

: The conjugacy classes of &lt;math&gt;\overline{T}&lt;/math&gt; are the following: 

:: &lt;math&gt;C_1 = \{U^0 = I\},&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;C_2 = \{U^3 = - I\},&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;C_3 = \{\pm S, \pm V, \pm SV\},&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;C_4 = \{U^2, SU^2, VU^2, SVU^2\},&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;C_5 = \{-U, SU, VU, SVU\},&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;C_6 = \{-U^2, -SU^2, -VU^2, -SVU^2\},&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;C_7 = \{U, -SU, -VU, -SVU\}.&lt;/math&gt;

: The character table of &lt;math&gt;\overline{T}&lt;/math&gt; is

: Here &lt;math&gt;\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}&lt;/math&gt;. The canonical representation is represented by&amp;nbsp;''c''. By using the inner product, we have that the McKay graph of &lt;math&gt;\overline{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the extended Coxeter–Dynkin diagram of type &lt;math&gt;\tilde{E}_6&lt;/math&gt;.

In mathematics, a '''measurable acting group''' is a special group that [[group action|acts]] on some space in a way that is compatible with structures of [[measure theory]]. Measurable acting groups are found in the intersection of measure theory and [[group theory]], two sub-disciplines of [[mathematics]]. Measurable acting groups are the basis for the study of invariant measures in abstract settings, most famously the [[Haar measure]], and the study of [[stationary random measure]]s.

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt; (G, \mathcal G, \circ) &lt;/math&gt; be a [[measurable group]], where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal G &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Sigma-algebra|&lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;-algebra]] on &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \circ &lt;/math&gt; the [[group law]]. Let further &lt;math&gt; (S, \mathcal S) &lt;/math&gt; be a [[measurable space]] and let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal A \otimes \mathcal B &lt;/math&gt; be the [[Product sigma-algebra|product &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;-algebra]] of the &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;-algebras &lt;math&gt; \mathcal A &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathcal B &lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; [[group action|act]] on &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; with group action
:&lt;math&gt; \Phi \colon G \times S \to S &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt; is a [[measurable function]] from &lt;math&gt; \mathcal G \otimes \mathcal S &lt;/math&gt;  to &lt;math&gt; \mathcal S &lt;/math&gt;, then it is called a '''measurable group action'''. In this case, the group &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; is said to act measurable on &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;.

== Example: Measurable groups as measurable acting groups ==
One special case of measurable acting groups are measurable groups themselves. If &lt;math&gt; S=G &lt;/math&gt;, and the group action is the group law, then a measurable group is a group &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt;, acting measurably on &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Multi-user MIMO''' ('''MU-MIMO''') is a set of [[multiple-input and multiple-output]] (MIMO) technologies for [[wireless]] communication, in which a set of users or wireless terminals, each with one or more antennas, communicate with each other.&lt;ref name="GOLBO16"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs-wm/53332.pdf |doi=10.5772/66.399| isbn=9781466557529|title=Beamforming in Wireless Networks|year=2016|last1=Golbon-Haghighi|first1=M.H. |journal=InTech Open| pages=163–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, single-user MIMO considers a single multi-antenna transmitter communicating with a single multi-antenna receiver. In a similar way that [[OFDMA]] adds multiple access (multi-user) capabilities to [[OFDM]], MU-MIMO adds multiple access (multi-user) capabilities to MIMO. MU-MIMO has been investigated since the beginning of research into multi-antenna communication, including work by Telatar&lt;ref name=telatar&gt;{{cite journal|first=Emre|last=Telatar|title=Capacity of Multi-antenna Gaussian Channels|journal=European Transactions on Telecommunications|pages=585–95|volume=10|year=1999|url=http://mars.bell-labs.com/papers/proof/|issue=6|doi=10.1002/ett.4460100604|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208121926/http://mars.bell-labs.com/papers/proof/|archivedate=2012-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the capacity of the MU-MIMO uplink.

==Technology==
Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) can leverage multiple users as spatially distributed transmission resources, at the cost of somewhat more expensive signal processing.  In comparison, conventional, or single-user [[Multiple-input multiple-output communications|MIMO]] considers only local device multiple antenna dimensions. Multi-user MIMO algorithms are developed to enhance MIMO systems when the number of users or connections is greater than one. Multi-user MIMO can be generalized into two categories: MIMO broadcast channels (MIMO BC) and MIMO multiple access channels (MIMO MAC) for downlink and uplink situations, respectively. Single-user MIMO can be represented as point-to-point, pairwise MIMO.

To remove ambiguity of the words ''receiver'' and ''transmitter'', we can adopt the terms ''access point'' (AP; or, ''base station''), and ''user''. An AP is the transmitter and a user is the receiver for downlink environments, whereas an AP is the receiver and a user is the transmitter for uplink environments.  Homogeneous networks are somewhat freed from this distinction.

==MIMO broadcast (MIMO BC)==
[[Image:Multiuser mimo.jpg|thumb|400px|Multiuser MIMO System: MIMO BC case]]

''MIMO broadcast'' represents a MIMO downlink case in a single sender to multiple receiver wireless network. Examples of advanced transmit processing for MIMO BC are interference aware [[precoding]] and SDMA-based downlink user scheduling. For advanced transmit processing, the [[channel state information]] has to be known at the transmitter (CSIT). That is, knowledge of CSIT allows throughput improvement, and methods to obtain CSIT become of significant importance. MIMO BC systems have an outstanding advantage over point-to-point MIMO systems, especially when the number of transmit antennas at the transmitter, or AP, is larger than the number of receiver antennas at each receiver (user).  Two categories of  coding techniques for the MIMO BC include those using [[dirty paper coding]] (DPC) and linear techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Q. Spencer |author2=M. Haardt |author3=A. L. Swindlehurst  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Zero-Forcing Methods for Downlink Spatial Multiplexing in Multi-User MIMO Channels|journal=IEEE Trans. Signal Process.|date=February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MIMO MAC==
Conversely, the MIMO multiple-access-channel or ''MIMO MAC'' represents a MIMO uplink case in the multiple sender to single receiver wireless network. Examples of advanced receive processing for MIMO MAC are joint interference cancellation and SDMA-based uplink user scheduling. For advanced receive processing, the receiver has to know the [[channel state information]] at the receiver (CSIR). Knowing CSIR is generally easier than knowing CSIT. However, knowing CSIR costs a lot of uplink resources to transmit dedicated pilots from each user to the AP. MIMO MAC systems outperforms point-to-point MIMO systems especially when the number of receiver antennas at an AP is larger than the number of transmit antennas at each user.

==Cross-layer MIMO==
''Cross-layer MIMO'' enhances the performance of MIMO links by solving certain cross-layer problems that may occur when MIMO configurations are employed in a system. Cross-layer techniques can be used to enhance the performance of SISO links as well. Examples of cross-layer techniques are Joint Source-Channel Coding, Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC, or "Link Adaptation"), Hybrid ARQ (HARQ), and user scheduling.

==Multi-user to multi-user==
The highly interconnected wireless ad hoc network increases the flexibility of wireless networking at the cost of increased multi-user interference. To improve the interference immunity, PHY/MAC-layer protocols have evolved from competition based to cooperative based transmission and reception. [[Cooperative wireless communications]] can actually exploit interference, which includes self-interference and other user interference. In cooperative wireless communications, each node might use self-interference and other user interference to improve the performance of data encoding and decoding, whereas conventional nodes are generally directed to avoid the interference. For example, once strong interference is decodable, a node decodes and cancels the strong interference before decoding the self-signal.  The mitigation of low Carrier over Interference (CoI) ratios can be implemented across PHY/MAC/Application network layers in cooperative systems.

* Cooperative multiple antenna research – Apply [[multiple antenna research|multiple antenna technologies]] in situations with antennas distributed among neighboring wireless terminals.
** [[Cooperative diversity]] – Achieve [[antenna diversity]] gain by the cooperation of distributed antennas belonging to each independent node.
** Cooperative MIMO – Achieve [[Multiple-input multiple-output communications|MIMO]] advantages, including the [[spatial multiplexing]] gain, using the transmit or receiver cooperation of distributed antennas belonging to many different nodes.
* Cooperative relay – Apply cooperative concepts onto relay techniques, which is similar to cooperative diversity in terms of cooperative signalling. However, the main criterion of cooperative relay is to improve the tradeoff region between delay and performance, while that of cooperative diversity and MIMO is to improve the link and system performance at the expense of minimal cooperation loss.

=== Cooperative MIMO (CO-MIMO) ===
{{Main|Cooperative MIMO}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}

'''CO-MIMO''', also known as '''network MIMO''' ('''net-MIMO'''), or '''ad hoc MIMO''', uses distributed antennas which belong to other users, while conventional MIMO, i.e., single-user MIMO, only employs antennas belonging to the local terminal. CO-MIMO improves the performance of a wireless network by introducing multiple antenna advantages, such as diversity, multiplexing and [[beamforming]]. If the main interest hinges on the diversity gain, it is known as [[cooperative diversity]]. It can be described as a form of [[macro-diversity]], used for example in [[soft handover]]. Cooperative MIMO corresponds to [[transmitter macro-diversity]] or [[simulcasting]]. A simple form that does not require any advanced signal processing is [[single frequency network]]s (SFN), used especially in wireless broadcasting. SFNs combined with channel adaptive or traffic adaptive scheduling is called [[dynamic single frequency networks]] (DSFN).

CO-MIMO is a technique useful for future cellular networks which consider [[wireless mesh networking]] or wireless ad hoc networking. In [[wireless ad hoc network]]s, multiple transmit nodes communicate with multiple receive nodes. To optimize the capacity of ad hoc channels, MIMO concepts and techniques can be applied to multiple links between the transmit and receive node clusters. Contrasted to multiple antennas in a single-user MIMO transceiver, participating nodes and their antennas are located in a distributed manner. So, to achieve the capacity of this network, techniques to manage distributed radio resources are essential.  Strategies such as [[Cognitive radio|autonomous interference cognition]], node cooperation, and network coding with dirty paper coding have been suggested to optimize wireless network capacity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5321">The '''Newton–Pepys problem''' is a [[probability]] problem concerning the probability of throwing sixes from a certain number of dice.&lt;ref name="wolfram"&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=Newton-PepysProblem |title=Newton-Pepys Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1693 [[Samuel Pepys]] and [[Isaac Newton]] corresponded over a problem posed by Pepys in relation to a [[gambling|wager]] he planned to make. The problem was:

:''Which of the following three propositions has the greatest chance of success?''

::''A. Six fair dice are tossed independently and at least one “6” appears.''
::''B. Twelve fair dice are tossed independently and at least two “6”s appear.''
::''C. Eighteen fair dice are tossed independently and at least three “6”s appear.''&lt;ref name="Stigler"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1214/088342306000000312|title=Isaac Newton as a Probabilist|journal=Statistical Science|volume=21|issue=3|pages=400|year=2006|last1=Stigler|first1=Stephen M|author-link=Stephen Stigler|arxiv=math/0701089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pepys initially thought that outcome C had the highest probability, but Newton correctly concluded that outcome A actually has the highest probability.

==Solution==
The probabilities of outcomes A, B and C are:&lt;ref name="wolfram" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P(A)=1-\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{6} = \frac{31031}{46656} \approx 0.6651\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P(B)=1-\sum_{x=0}^1\binom{12}{x}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^x\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{12-x}
= \frac{1346704211}{2176782336} \approx 0.6187\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P(C)=1-\sum_{x=0}^2\binom{18}{x}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^x\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{18-x}
= \frac{15166600495229}{25389989167104} \approx 0.5973\, .&lt;/math&gt;

These results may be obtained by applying the [[binomial distribution]] (although Newton obtained them from first principles). In general, if P(''N'') is the probability of throwing at least ''n'' sixes with 6''n'' dice, then:

:&lt;math&gt;P(N)=1-\sum_{x=0}^{n-1}\binom{6n}{x}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^x\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{6n-x}\, .&lt;/math&gt;

As ''n'' grows, P(''N'') decreases monotonically towards an asymptotic limit of 1/2.

==Example in R ==
The solution outlined above can be implemented in [[R (programming language)|R]] as follows:
&lt;source lang = "rsplus"&gt;
for (s in 1:3) {          # looking for s = 1, 2 or 3 sixes
  n = 6*s                 # ... in n = 6, 12 or 18 dice
  q = pbinom(s-1,n,1/6)   # q = Prob( &lt;s sixes in n dice )
  cat( "Probability of at least", s, "six in", n, "fair dice:", 1-q, "\n")
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Newton's explanation==
Although Newton correctly calculated the odds of each bet, he provided a separate intuitive explanation to Pepys. He imagined that B and C toss their dice in groups of six, and said that A was most favorable because it required a 6 in only one toss, while B and C required a 6 in each of their tosses. This explanation assumes that a group does not produce more than one 6, so it does not actually correspond to the original problem.&lt;ref name="Stigler" /&gt;

==Generalizations==
A natural generalization of the problem is to consider ''n'' non-necessarily fair dice, with ''p'' the probability that each die will select the 6 face when thrown (notice that actually the number of faces of the dice and which face should be selected are irrelevant). If ''r'' is the total number of dice selecting the 6 face, then &lt;math&gt;P(r \ge k ; n, p)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of having at least ''k'' correct selections when throwing exactly ''n'' dice. Then the original Newton–Pepys problem can be generalized as follows:

Let &lt;math&gt;\nu_1, \nu_2&lt;/math&gt; be natural positive numbers s.t. &lt;math&gt;\nu_1 \le \nu_2&lt;/math&gt;. Is then &lt;math&gt;P(r \ge \nu_1 k ; \nu_1 n, p)&lt;/math&gt; not smaller than &lt;math&gt;P(r \ge \nu_2 k ; \nu_2 n, p)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n, p, k''?

Notice that, with this notation, the original Newton–Pepys problem reads as: is &lt;math&gt;P(r \ge 1 ; 6, 1/6) \ge P(r \ge 2 ; 12, 1/6) \ge P(r \ge 3 ; 18, 1/6)&lt;/math&gt;?

As noticed in Rubin and Evans (1961), there are no uniform answers to the generalized Newton–Pepys problem since answers depend on ''k, n'' and ''p''. There are nonetheless some variations of the previous questions that admit uniform answers:

(from Chaundy and Bullard (1960)):&lt;ref&gt;Chaundy, T.W., Bullard, J.E., 1960. "John Smith’s Problem." ''The Mathematical Gazette'' 44, 253-260.&lt;/ref&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;k_1, k_2, n&lt;/math&gt; are positive natural numbers, and &lt;math&gt;k_1 &lt; k_2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P(r \ge k_1 ; k_1 n, \frac{1}{n}) &gt; P(r \ge k_2 ; k_2 n, \frac{1}{n})&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;k, n_1, n_2&lt;/math&gt; are positive natural numbers, and &lt;math&gt;n_1 &lt; n_2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;P(r \ge k ; k n_1, \frac{1}{n_1}) &gt; P(r \ge k ; k n_2, \frac{1}{n_2})&lt;/math&gt;.

(from Varagnolo, Pillonetto and Schenato (2013)):&lt;ref&gt;D. Varagnolo, L. Schenato, G. Pillonetto, 2013. "A variation of the Newton–Pepys problem and its connections to size-estimation problems." ''Statistics &amp; Probability Letters'' 83 (5), 1472-1478.&lt;/ref&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\nu_1, \nu_2 , n, k&lt;/math&gt; are positive natural numbers, and &lt;math&gt;\nu_1 \le \nu_2, k \le n, p \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;P(r = \nu_1 k ; \nu_1 n, p) \ge P(r = \nu_2 k ; \nu_2 n, p)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Nodes.PNG|thumb|240px|Two execution environments instances nested in a device instance]]
A '''node''' In the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) is a computational resource upon which [[artifact (UML)|UML artifact]]s may be deployed for execution.
&lt;ref name= "OMG UML V2.1.2"&gt; OMG (2008). ''[http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.1.2/Superstructure/PDF OMG Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML), Superstructure, V2.1.2]'' p.199-210.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two types of nodes: ''device'' nodes and ''execution environments''.

* A device represents hardware devices: a physical computational resource with processing capability upon which [[Artifact (UML)|UML artifact]]s may be deployed for execution. Devices may be complex (i.e., they may consist of other devices).&lt;ref name= "OMG UML V2.1.2"/&gt;
* An execution environment represents [[software container]]s (such as operating systems, JVM, servlet/EJB containers, application servers, portal servers etc.) This is a node that offers an execution environment for specific types of components that are deployed on it in the form of deployable artifacts.&lt;ref name= "OMG UML V2.1.2"/&gt; 

Execution environments can be nested. Nodes can be interconnected through communication paths to define network structures. A ''communication path'' is an "association between two DeploymentTargets, through which they are able to exchange signals and messages".&lt;ref name= "OMG UML V2.1.2"/&gt;

== Usage ==
When modeling devices, it is possible to model them in several different ways:

* Name a device using the type and make, for instance "IBM RS6000", "HP 9000".
* Name a device using its intended function, for instance "Database Server", "High Speed Switch"
* Name a device using the operating system deployed on it, for instance "Linux Server", "Solaris Server".

Use tagged values to specify characteristics of devices / execution environments, for instance "Memory=2GB", "Disk Space=32GB", "Version=2.5.1".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29936">In the mathematical field of [[set theory]], '''ordinal arithmetic''' describes the three usual operations on [[ordinal number]]s: addition, multiplication, and exponentiation.  Each can be defined in essentially two different ways: either by constructing an explicit [[well-order|well-ordered set]] which represents the operation or by using [[transfinite recursion]].  Cantor normal form provides a standardized way of writing ordinals.  The so-called "natural" arithmetical operations retain [[commutative property|commutativity]] at the expense of [[continuous function|continuity]].  Interpreted as [[nimber]]s, ordinals are also subject to nimber arithmetic operations.

== Addition ==

The union of two disjoint well-ordered sets ''S'' and ''T'' can be well-ordered.  The [[order-type]] of that union is the ordinal which results from adding the order-types of ''S'' and ''T''.  If two well-ordered sets are not already disjoint, then they can be replaced by order-isomorphic disjoint sets, e.g. replace ''S'' by {0} × ''S'' and ''T'' by {1} × ''T''.  This way, the well-ordered set ''S'' is written "to the left" of the well-ordered set ''T'', meaning one defines an order on ''S'' &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; ''T'' in which every element of ''S'' is smaller than every element of ''T''. The sets ''S'' and ''T'' themselves keep the ordering they already have. This addition of the order-types is [[associative]] and generalizes the addition of [[natural numbers]].

The first transfinite ordinal is ω, the set of all natural numbers.
For example, the ordinal ω + ω is obtained by two copies of the natural numbers ordered in the usual fashion and the second copy completely to the right of the first. Writing 0' &lt; 1' &lt; 2' &lt; ... for the second copy, ω + ω looks like
:0 &lt; 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3 &lt; ... &lt; 0' &lt; 1' &lt; 2' &lt; ...
This is different from ω because in ω only 0 does not have a direct predecessor while in ω + ω the two elements 0 and 0' do not have direct predecessors.
As another example, here are 3 + ω and ω + 3:
:0 &lt; 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 0' &lt; 1' &lt; 2' &lt; ...
:0 &lt; 1 &lt; 2 &lt; ... &lt; 0' &lt; 1' &lt; 2'
After relabeling, the former just looks like ω itself, i.e. 3 + ω = ω, while the latter does not: {{nowrap|ω + 3}} is not equal to ω since {{nowrap|ω + 3}} has a largest element (namely, 2') and ω does not (even if ω and {{nowrap|ω + 3}} are equipotent, they are not isomorphic). Hence, this addition is not [[commutative]]. In fact it is quite rare for α+β to be equal to β+α: this happens if and only if α=γ''m'', β=γ''n'' for some ordinal γ and natural numbers ''m'' and ''n''. From this it follows that "α commutes with β" is an equivalence relation on the set of nonzero ordinals, and all the equivalence classes are countably infinite.

However, addition is still associative; one can see for example that (ω + 4) + ω = ω + (4 + ω) = ω + ω.

The definition of addition can also be given [[Transfinite induction|inductively]] (the following induction is on ''β''):
* ''α'' + 0 = ''α'',
* ''α'' + (''β'' + 1) = (''α'' + ''β'') + 1 (here, "+ 1" denotes the ''[[Successor ordinal|successor]]'' of an ordinal),
* and if ''β'' is a [[limit ordinal]] then ''α'' + ''β'' is the limit of the ''α'' + ''δ'' for all ''δ'' &amp;lt; ''β''.

Using this definition, ω + 3 can be seen to be a [[successor ordinal]] (it is the successor of ω + 2), whereas 3 + ω is a [[limit ordinal]], namely, the limit of 3 + 0 = 3, 3 + 1 = 4, 3 + 2 = 5, etc., which is just ω.

Zero is an additive identity ''α'' + 0 = 0 + ''α'' = ''α''.

Addition is associative (''α'' + ''β'') + ''γ'' = ''α'' + (''β'' + ''γ'').

Addition is strictly increasing and continuous in the right argument:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \beta \Rightarrow \gamma + \alpha &lt; \gamma + \beta&lt;/math&gt;
but the analogous relation does not hold for the left argument; instead we only have:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; \beta \Rightarrow \alpha+\gamma \le \beta+\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

Ordinal addition is [[left-cancellative]]: if ''α'' + ''β'' = ''α'' + ''γ'', then ''β'' = ''γ''. Furthermore, one can define [[left division|left subtraction]] for ordinals ''β'' ≤ ''α'': there is a unique ''γ'' such that ''α'' = ''β'' + ''γ''.
On the other hand, right cancellation does not work:
:&lt;math&gt;3+\omega = 0+\omega = \omega&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;3 \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
Nor does right subtraction, even when ''β'' ≤ ''α'': for example, there does not exist any ''γ'' such that ''γ'' + 42 = ω.

If the ordinals less than α are closed under addition and contain 0 then α is occasionally called a γ-number (see [[additively indecomposable ordinal]]). These are exactly the ordinals of the form ω&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Multiplication ==

The [[Cartesian product]], ''S×T'', of two well-ordered sets ''S'' and ''T'' can be well-ordered by a variant of [[lexicographical order]] that puts the least significant position first.  Effectively, each element of ''T'' is replaced by a disjoint copy of ''S''. The order-type of the Cartesian product is the ordinal which results from multiplying the order-types of ''S'' and ''T''.  Again, this operation is associative and generalizes the multiplication of natural numbers.

Here is ω·2:
:0&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 2&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 3&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ... &lt; 0&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ...
which has the same order type as ω + ω. In contrast, 2·ω looks like this:
:0&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 0&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; 1&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ...
and after relabeling, this looks just like ω.
Thus, ω·2 = ω+ω ≠ ω = 2·ω, showing that multiplication of ordinals is not commutative. More generally, a natural number greater than 1 never commutes with any infinite ordinal, and two infinite ordinals α, β commute if and only if α&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; = β&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for some positive natural numbers ''m'' and ''n''. The relation "α commutes with β" is an equivalence relation on the ordinals greater than 1, and all equivalence classes are countably infinite.

[[Distributivity]] partially holds for ordinal arithmetic: ''R''(''S''+''T'') = ''RS''+''RT''. However, the other distributive law (''T''+''U'')''R'' = ''TR''+''UR'' is ''not'' generally true: (1+1)·ω = 2·ω = ω while 1·ω+1·ω = ω+ω which is different. Therefore, the ordinal numbers form a left [[near-semiring]], but do ''not'' form a [[ring (algebra)|ring]].

The definition of multiplication can also be given inductively (the following induction is on ''β''):
* ''α''·0 = 0,
* ''α''·(''β''+1) = (''α''·''β'')+''α'',
* and if ''β'' is a limit ordinal then ''α''·''β'' is the limit of the ''α''·''δ'' for ''δ'' &amp;lt; ''β''.

The main properties of the product are:
*''α''·0 = 0·''α'' = 0.
*One (1) is a multiplicative identity ''α''·1 = 1·''α'' = ''α''.
*Multiplication is associative (''α''·''β'')·''γ'' = ''α''·(''β''·''γ'').
*Multiplication is strictly increasing and continuous in the right argument: (''α'' &lt; ''β'' and ''γ'' &gt; 0) &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''γ''·''α'' &lt; ''γ''·''β''
*Multiplication is ''not'' strictly increasing in the left argument, for example, 1 &lt; 2 but 1·ω = 2·ω = ω. However, it is (non-strictly) increasing, i.e. ''α'' ≤ ''β'' &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''α''·''γ'' ≤ ''β''·''γ''.
*There is a [[left-cancellative|left cancellation]] law:  If ''α'' &gt; 0 and ''α''·''β'' = ''α''·''γ'', then ''β'' = ''γ''.
*Right cancellation does not work, e.g. 1·ω = 2·ω = ω, but 1 and 2 are different.
*''α''·''β'' = 0 &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''α'' = 0 or ''β'' = 0.
*Distributive law on the left: ''α''·(''β''+''γ'') = ''α''·''β''+''α''·''γ''
*No distributive law on the right: e.g. (ω+1)·2 = ω+1+ω+1 = ω+ω+1 = ω·2+1 which is not ω·2+2.
*[[Left division]] with [[remainder]]: for all ''α'' and ''β'', if ''β'' &gt; 0, then there are unique ''γ'' and ''δ'' such that ''α'' = ''β''·''γ''+''δ'' and ''δ'' &lt; ''β''. (This does not however mean the ordinals are a [[Euclidean domain]], since they are not even a ring, and the Euclidean "norm" is ordinal-valued.)
*Right division does not work: there is no ''α'' such that ''α''·ω ≤ ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ (''α''+1)·ω.

A δ-number (see [[additively indecomposable ordinal#Multiplicatively indecomposable]]) is an ordinal greater than 1 such that αδ=δ whenever 0&lt;α&lt;δ. These consist of the ordinal 2 and the ordinals of the form ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Exponentiation ==

The definition of ordinal [[exponentiation]] for finite exponents is straightforward. If the exponent is a finite number, the power is the result of iterated multiplication. For instance, ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ω·ω using the operation of ordinal multiplication. Note that ω·ω can be defined using the set of functions from 2 = {0,1} to ω = {0,1,2,...}, ordered [[Lexicographical order|lexicographically]] with the least significant position first:
:(0,0) &lt; (1,0) &lt; (2,0) &lt; (3,0) &lt; ... &lt; (0,1) &lt; (1,1) &lt; (2,1) &lt; (3,1) &lt; ... &lt; (0,2) &lt; (1,2) &lt; (2,2) &lt; ...
Here for brevity, we have replaced the function {(0,''k''), (1,''m'')} by the [[ordered pair]] (''k'', ''m'').

Similarly, for any finite exponent ''n'', &lt;math&gt;\omega^n&lt;/math&gt; can be defined using the set of functions from ''n'' (the domain) to the natural numbers (the range). These functions can be abbreviated as [[tuple|''n''-tuples]] of natural numbers.

But for infinite exponents, the definition may not be obvious. A limit ordinal, such as ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;, is the supremum of all smaller ordinals. It might seem natural to define ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; using the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers. However, we find that any [[absoluteness (mathematical logic)|absolutely]] defined ordering on this set is not well-ordered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} To deal with this issue we can use the variant lexicographical ordering again. We restrict the set to sequences which are nonzero for only a finite number of arguments. This is naturally motivated as the limit of the finite powers of the base (similar to the concept of [[coproduct]] in algebra). This can also be thought of as the [[infinite union]] &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n&lt;\omega}\omega^n&lt;/math&gt;.

Each of those sequences corresponds to an ordinal less than &lt;math&gt;\omega^\omega&lt;/math&gt; such as &lt;math&gt;\omega^{n_1} c_1 + \omega^{n_2} c_2 + \cdots + \omega^{n_k} c_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega^\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the supremum of all those smaller ordinals.

The lexicographical order on this set is a well ordering that resembles the ordering of natural numbers written in decimal notation, except with digit positions reversed, and with arbitrary natural numbers instead of just the digits 0–9:

:(0,0,0,...) &lt; (1,0,0,0,...) &lt; (2,0,0,0,...) &lt; ... &lt;
:(0,1,0,0,0,...) &lt; (1,1,0,0,0,...) &lt; (2,1,0,0,0,...) &lt; ... &lt;
:(0,2,0,0,0,...) &lt; (1,2,0,0,0,...) &lt; (2,2,0,0,0,...)
:: &lt; ... &lt;
:(0,0,1,0,0,0,...) &lt; (1,0,1,0,0,0,...) &lt; (2,0,1,0,0,0,...)
:: &lt; ...

In general, any ordinal ''α'' can be raised to the power of another ordinal ''β'' in the same way to get ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''β''&lt;/sup&gt;.

It is easiest to explain this using [[Ordinal number#Von Neumann definition of ordinals|Von Neumann's definition of an ordinal as the set of all smaller ordinals]]. Then, to construct a set of order type ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''β''&lt;/sup&gt; consider all functions from ''β'' to ''α'' such that only a finite number of elements of the domain ''β'' map to a non zero element of ''α'' (essentially, we consider the functions with finite [[Support (mathematics)|support]]).  The order is lexicographic with the least significant position first. We find
* 1&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; = 1,
* 2&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; = ω,
* 2&lt;sup&gt;ω+1&lt;/sup&gt; = ω·2 = ω+ω.

The definition of exponentiation can also be given inductively (the following induction is on ''β'', the exponent):
* ''α''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1,
* ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''β''+1&lt;/sup&gt; = (''α''&lt;sup&gt;''β''&lt;/sup&gt;)·''α'', and
* if ''β'' is a limit ordinal, then ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''β''&lt;/sup&gt; is the limit of the ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''δ''&lt;/sup&gt; for all ''δ'' &amp;lt; ''β''.

Properties of ordinal exponentiation:
*''α''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.
*If 0 &lt; ''α'', then 0&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.
*1&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.
*''α''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''α''.
*''α''&lt;sup&gt;''β''&lt;/sup&gt;·''α''&lt;sup&gt;''γ''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''β'' + ''γ''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* (''α''&lt;sup&gt;''β''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''γ''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''β''·''γ''&lt;/sup&gt;.
*There are ''α'', ''β'', and ''γ'' for which (''α''·''β'')&lt;sup&gt;''γ''&lt;/sup&gt; ≠ ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''γ''&lt;/sup&gt;·''β''&lt;sup&gt;''γ''&lt;/sup&gt;. For instance, (ω·2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ω·2·ω·2 = ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·2 ≠ ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·4.
*Ordinal exponentiation is strictly increasing and continuous in the right argument: If ''γ'' &gt; 1 and ''α'' &lt; ''β'', then ''γ''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; ''γ''&lt;sup&gt;''β''&lt;/sup&gt;.
*If ''α'' &lt; ''β'', then ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''γ''&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''β''&lt;sup&gt;''γ''&lt;/sup&gt;. Note, for instance, that 2 &lt; 3 and yet 2&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; = 3&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; = ω.
*If ''α'' &gt; 1 and ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''β''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''α''&lt;sup&gt;''γ''&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''β'' = ''γ''. If ''α'' =  1 or ''α'' =  0 this is not the case.
*For all ''α'' and ''β'', if ''β'' &gt; 1 and ''α'' &gt; 0 then there exist unique ''γ'', ''δ'', and ''ρ'' such that ''α'' = ''β''&lt;sup&gt;''γ''&lt;/sup&gt;·''δ'' + ''ρ'' such that 0 &lt; ''δ'' &lt; ''β'' and ''ρ'' &lt; ''β''&lt;sup&gt;''γ''&lt;/sup&gt;.

While the same notation is used for ordinal exponentiation and [[cardinal exponentiation]], ordinal exponentiation is quite different from cardinal exponentiation. For example, with ordinal exponentiation &lt;math&gt;2^\omega = \omega&lt;/math&gt;, but for &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;([[aleph naught]], the [[cardinality]] of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0} &gt; \aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;2^{\aleph_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the cardinality of the set of all functions from the set of all natural numbers to a set with two elements. (This is the cardinality of the [[power set]] of the set of all natural numbers and is equal to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak c&lt;/math&gt;, the [[cardinality of the continuum]].) To avoid confusing ordinal exponentiation with cardinal exponentiation, one can use symbols for ordinals (e.g. ω) in the former and symbols for cardinals (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;) in the latter.

Jacobsthal showed that the only solutions of α&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;β&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; with α&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;β are given by α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;β, or α&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and β&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4, or α is any limit ordinal and β&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;εα where ε is an ε-number larger than α.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Jacobsthal, Vertauschbarkeit transfiniter Ordnungszahlen, Mathematische Annalen, Bd 64 (1907), 475-488. Available [http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/pdfcache/PPN235181684_0064/PPN235181684_0064___LOG_0050.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cantor normal form ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ordinal number]] --&gt;

Every ordinal number ''α'' can be uniquely written as &lt;math&gt;\omega^{\beta_1} c_1 + \omega^{\beta_2}c_2 + \cdots + \omega^{\beta_k}c_k&lt;/math&gt;, where ''k'' is a natural number, &lt;math&gt;c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k&lt;/math&gt; are positive integers, and &lt;math&gt;\beta_1 &gt; \beta_2 &gt; \ldots &gt; \beta_k \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; are ordinal numbers. This decomposition of ''α'' is called the '''Cantor normal form''' of ''α'', and can be considered the base-ω [[positional numeral system]].  The highest exponent &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; is called the degree of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and satisfies &lt;math&gt;\beta_1\le\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. The equality &lt;math&gt;\beta_1=\alpha&lt;/math&gt; applies if and only if &lt;math&gt;\alpha=\omega^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. In that case Cantor normal form does not express the ordinal in terms of smaller ones; this can happen as explained below.

A minor variation of Cantor normal form, which is usually slightly easier to work with, is to set all the numbers ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; equal to 1 and allow the exponents to be equal. In other words, every ordinal number α can be uniquely written as &lt;math&gt;\omega^{\beta_1}  + \omega^{\beta_2} + \cdots + \omega^{\beta_k}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''k'' is a natural number,  and &lt;math&gt;\beta_1 \ge \beta_2 \ge \ldots \ge \beta_k \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; are ordinal numbers.

Another variation of the Cantor normal form is the "base δ expansion", where ω is replaced by any ordinal δ&gt;1, and the numbers ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are positive ordinals less than δ.

The Cantor normal form allows us to uniquely express&amp;mdash;and order&amp;mdash;the ordinals ''α'' that are built from the natural numbers by a finite number of arithmetical operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation base-&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;: in other words, assuming &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in the Cantor normal form, we can also express the exponents &lt;math&gt;\beta_i&lt;/math&gt; in Cantor normal form, and making the same assumption for the &lt;math&gt;\beta_i&lt;/math&gt; as for α and so on recursively, we get a system of notation for these ordinals (for example, 
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^{\left( \omega^{\left( \omega^7\cdot6+\omega+42 \right)}\cdot1729+\omega^9+88 \right)}\cdot3+\omega^{\left( \omega^\omega \right)}\cdot5+65537&lt;/math&gt;

denotes an ordinal).

The ordinal ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|epsilon nought]]) is the set of ordinal values &amp;alpha; of the finite-length arithmetical expressions of Cantor normal form that are hereditarily non-trivial where non-trivial means &amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;&amp;alpha; when 0&lt;&amp;alpha;. It is the smallest ordinal that does not have a finite arithmetical expression in terms of ω, and the smallest ordinal such that &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0 = \omega^{\varepsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. in Cantor normal form the exponent is not smaller than the ordinal itself. It is the limit of the sequence 
:&lt;math&gt;0, \, 1=\omega^0, \, \omega=\omega^1, \, \omega^\omega, \, \omega^{\omega^\omega}, \, \ldots \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The ordinal ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is important for various reasons in arithmetic (essentially because it measures the [[proof-theoretic strength]] of the [[First-order logic|first-order]] [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]]: that is, Peano's axioms can show transfinite induction up to any ordinal less than ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; but not up to ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; itself).

The Cantor normal form also allows us to compute sums and products of ordinals: to compute the sum, for example, one need merely know that
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^{\beta} c+\omega^{\beta'} c' = \omega^{\beta'}c' \,,&lt;/math&gt;

if &lt;math&gt;\beta'&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; (if &lt;math&gt;\beta'=\beta&lt;/math&gt; one can apply the distributive law on the left and rewrite this as &lt;math&gt;\omega^{\beta} (c+c')&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;\beta'&lt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; the expression is already in Cantor normal form); and to compute products, the essential facts are that when &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \alpha = \omega^{\beta_1} c_1 + \cdots + \omega^{\beta_k}c_k&lt;/math&gt; is in Cantor normal form and &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \beta' &lt;/math&gt;, then 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\omega^{\beta'} = \omega^{\beta_1 + \beta'} \,&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha n = \omega^{\beta_1} c_1 n + \omega^{\beta_2} c_2 + \cdots + \omega^{\beta_k}c_k \,,&lt;/math&gt;

if n is a non-zero natural number.

To compare two ordinals written in Cantor normal form, first compare &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\beta_2&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;, etc..  At the first difference, the ordinal that has the larger component is the larger ordinal.  If they are the same until one terminates before the other, then the one that terminates first is smaller.

==Factorization into primes==

[[Ernst Jacobsthal]] showed that the ordinals satisfy a form of the unique factorization theorem: every nonzero ordinal can be written as a product of a finite number of prime ordinals. This factorization into prime ordinals is in general not unique, but there is a "minimal" factorization into primes that is unique up to changing the order of finite prime factors {{harv|Sierpiński|1958}}.

A prime ordinal is an ordinal greater than 1 that cannot be written as a product of two smaller ordinals. Some of the first primes are 2, 3, 5, ... , ω, ω+1, ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1, ω&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+1, ..., ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;, ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;+1, ω&lt;sup&gt;ω+1&lt;/sup&gt;+1, ... There are three sorts of prime ordinals:
*The finite primes 2, 3, 5, ...
*The ordinals of the form ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for any ordinal α. These are the prime ordinals that are limits, and are the [[delta number]]s.
*The ordinals of the form ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;+1 for any ordinal α&gt;0. These are the infinite successor primes, and are the successors of [[Additively indecomposable ordinal|gamma number]]s, the additively indecomposable ordinals.

Factorization into primes is not unique: for example, 2×3=3×2, 2×ω=ω, (ω+1)×ω=ω×ω and ω×ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; = ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;. However, there is a unique factorization into primes satisfying the following additional conditions:
*Every limit prime occurs before every successor prime
*If two consecutive primes of the prime factorization are both limits or both finite, then the second one is at most the first one.

This prime factorization can easily be read off using the Cantor normal form as follows:
*First write the ordinal as a product αβ where α is the smallest power of ω in the Cantor normal form and β is a successor.
*If α=ω&lt;sup&gt;γ&lt;/sup&gt; then writing γ in Cantor normal form gives an expansion of α as a product of limit primes.
*Now look at the Cantor normal form of β. If β = ω&lt;sup&gt;λ&lt;/sup&gt;m + ω&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;''n''+ smaller terms then β = (ω&lt;sup&gt;μ&lt;/sup&gt;''n''+ smaller terms)(ω&lt;sup&gt;λ−μ&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)''m'' is a product of a smaller ordinal and a prime and an integer ''m''. Repeating this and factorizing the integers into primes gives the prime factorization of β.

So the factorization of the Cantor normal form ordinal
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^{\alpha_1}n_1+\cdots +\omega^{\alpha_k}n_k&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1&gt;\cdots&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt;) 
into a minimal product of infinite primes and integers is
:&lt;math&gt;\omega^{\omega^{\beta_1}}\cdots\omega^{\omega^{\beta_m}}n_k(\omega^{\alpha_{k-1}-\alpha_k}+1)n_{k-1}\cdots n_2(\omega^{\alpha_{1}-\alpha_2}+1)n_1&lt;/math&gt;
where each ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; should be replaced by its factorization into a non-increasing sequence of finite primes and
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_k=\omega^{\beta_1}+\cdots +\omega^{\beta_m}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\beta_1\ge\cdots\ge\beta_m&lt;/math&gt;.

==Large countable ordinals==

As discussed above, the Cantor Normal Form of ordinals below &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in an alphabet containing only the function symbols for addition, multiplication and exponentiation, as well as constant symbols for each natural number and for &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. We can do away with the infinitely many numerals by using just the constant symbol 0 and the operation of successor, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (for example, the integer 4 may be expressed as &lt;math&gt;S(S(S(S(0))))&lt;/math&gt;). This describes an ''[[ordinal notation]]'': a system for naming ordinals over a finite alphabet. This particular system of ordinal notation is called the collection of ''arithmetical'' ordinal expressions, and can express all ordinals below &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;, but cannot express &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;. There are other ordinal notations capable of capturing ordinals well past &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;, but because there are only countably many strings over any finite alphabet, for any given ordinal notation there will be ordinals below &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; (the [[first uncountable ordinal]]) that are not expressible. Such ordinals are known as [[large countable ordinal]]s.

The operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation are all examples of [[primitive recursive ordinal function]]s, and more general primitive recursive ordinal functions can be used to describe larger ordinals.

== Natural operations ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Surreal number]] --&gt;

The '''natural sum'''  and '''natural product''' operations on ordinals  were defined in 1906 by [[Gerhard Hessenberg]], and are sometimes called the  '''Hessenberg sum''' (or product) {{harv|Sierpinski|1958}}.  These are the same as the addition and multiplication (restricted to ordinals) of John Conway's [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[surreal numbers]]. They have the advantage that they are associative and commutative, and natural product distributes over natural sum.  The cost of making these operations commutative is that they lose the continuity in the right argument which is a property of the ordinary sum and product.
The natural sum of α and β is sometimes denoted by α # β, and the natural product by a sort of doubled × sign: α ⨳ β. 
(Other common notation is α ⊕ β and α ⊗ β).
To define the natural sum of two ordinals, consider once again the disjoint union &lt;math&gt;S\cup T&lt;/math&gt; of two well-ordered sets having these order types.  Start by putting a partial order on this disjoint union by taking the orders on ''S'' and ''T'' separately but imposing no relation between ''S'' and ''T''.  Now consider the order types of ''all'' well-orders on &lt;math&gt;S\cup T&lt;/math&gt; which extend this partial order: the least upper bound of all these ordinals (which is, actually, not merely a least upper bound but actually a greatest element) is the natural sum.&lt;ref&gt;Philip W. Carruth, Arithmetic of ordinals with applications to the theory of ordered Abelian groups, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 48 (1942), 262–271. See Theorem 1. Available [http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1942-48-04/S0002-9904-1942-07649-X/S0002-9904-1942-07649-X.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, we can define the natural sum of ''α'' and ''β'' inductively (by simultaneous induction on ''α'' and ''β'') as the smallest ordinal greater than the natural sum of ''α'' and ''γ'' for all ''γ'' &amp;lt; ''β'' and of ''γ'' and ''β'' for all ''γ'' &amp;lt; ''α''.

The natural sum is associative and commutative.  It is always greater or equal to the usual sum, but it may be greater.  For example, the natural sum of ω and 1 is ω+1 (the usual sum), but this is also the natural sum of 1 and ω.

To define the natural product of two ordinals, consider once again the cartesian product ''S'' × ''T'' of two well-ordered sets having these order types.  Start by putting a partial order on this cartesian product by using just the product order (compare two pairs if and only if each of the two coordinates is comparable).  Now consider the order types of ''all'' well-orders on ''S'' × ''T'' which extend this partial order: the least upper bound of all these ordinals (which is, actually, not merely a least upper bound but actually a greatest element) is the natural product.  There is also an inductive definition of the natural product (by mutual induction), but it is somewhat tedious to write down and we shall not do so (see the article on [[surreal numbers]] for the definition in that context, which, however, uses surreal subtraction, something which obviously cannot be defined on ordinals).

The natural product is associative and commutative and distributes over the natural sum.  It is always greater or equal to the usual product, but it may be greater.  For example, the natural product of ω and 2 is ω·2 (the usual product), but this is also the natural product of 2 and ω.

Yet another way to define the natural sum and product of two ordinals α and β is to use the Cantor normal form: one can find a sequence of ordinals 
γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; … &amp;gt; γ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; 
and two sequences (''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) and 
(''j''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''j''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) of natural numbers (including zero, but satisfying 
''k''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''j''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0 for all ''i'') such that 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \omega^{\gamma_1}\cdot k_1 + \cdots +\omega^{\gamma_n}\cdot k_n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \omega^{\gamma_1}\cdot j_1 + \cdots +\omega^{\gamma_n}\cdot j_n&lt;/math&gt;
and defines 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \#\beta = \omega^{\gamma_1}\cdot (k_1+j_1) + \cdots +\omega^{\gamma_n}\cdot (k_n+j_n).&lt;/math&gt;

Under natural addition, the ordinals can be identified with the elements of the free abelian group with basis the gamma numbers ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; that have non-negative integer coefficients.  Under natural addition and multiplication, the ordinals can be identified with the elements of the (commutative) polynomial ring generated by the delta numbers ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that have non-negative integer coefficients.
The ordinals do not have unique factorization into primes under the natural product. While the full polynomial ring does have unique factorization, the subset of polynomials with non-negative coefficients does not: for example, if ''x'' is any delta number, then
:&lt;math&gt;x^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1=(x+1)(x^4+x^2+1)=(x^2+x+1)(x^3+1)&lt;/math&gt;
has two incompatible expressions as a natural product of polynomials with non-negative coefficients that cannot be decomposed further.

==Nimber arithmetic==
{{main|Nimber}}
There are arithmetic operations on ordinals by virtue of the one-to-one correspondence between ordinals and [[nimber]]s.  Three common operations on nimbers are nimber addition, nimber multiplication, and [[Mex (mathematics)|minimum excludance (mex)]].  Nimber addition is a generalization of the [[Bitwise operation#XOR|bitwise exclusive or]] operation on natural numbers.  The {{math|mex}} of a set of ordinals is the smallest ordinal ''not'' present in the set.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1851">In [[mathematics]], [[computer science]] and [[logic]], '''overlap''', as a property of the reduction rules in [[term rewriting system]], describes a situation where a number of different reduction rules specify potentially contradictory ways of reducing a reducible expression (or ''redex'') within a term. More precisely, if a number of different reduction rules share function symbols on the left hand side, overlap can occur. Often we do not consider trivial overlap with a redex and itself.

For example, consider the term rewriting system defined by the reduction rules
: &lt;math&gt;\rho_1\ :\ f(g(x), y) \rightarrow y&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\rho_2\ :\ g(x) \rightarrow f(x, x)&lt;/math&gt;
The term ''f''(''g''(''x''), ''y'') can be reduced via &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to yield ''y'', but it can also be reduced via &amp;rho;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to yield ''f''(''f''(''x'', ''x''), ''y''). Note how the redex ''g''(''x'') is contained in the redex ''f''(''g''(''x''), ''y''). The result of reducing different redexes is described in a ''[[Critical pair (logic)|critical pair]]''—the critical pair arising out of this term rewriting system is (''f''(''f''(''x'', ''x''), ''y''), ''y'').

Overlap may occur with fewer than two reduction rules. Consider the term rewriting system defined by the reduction rule
: &lt;math&gt; \rho_1\ :\ g(g(x)) \rightarrow x&lt;/math&gt;
The term ''g''(''g''(''g''(''x''))) has overlapping redexes, which can be either applied to the innermost occurrence or to the outermost occurrence of the ''g''(''g''(''x'')) term.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3414">In [[mathematical logic]], '''Peano–Russell notation''' was [[Bertrand Russell]]'s application of [[Giuseppe Peano]]'s logical notation to the logical notions of [[Frege]] and was used in the writing of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' in collaboration with [[Alfred North Whitehead]]:&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The notation adopted in the present work is based upon that of Peano, and the following explanations are to some extent modelled on those which he prefixes to his ''Formulario Mathematico''." (Chapter I: Preliminary Explanations of Ideas and Notations, page 4)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Variables==
In the notation, variables are ambiguous in denotation, preserve a recognizable identity appearing in various places in logical statements within a given context, and have a range of possible determination between any two variables which is the same or different. When the possible determination is the same for both variables, then one implies the other; otherwise, the possible determination of one given to the other produces a meaningless phrase. The alphabetic symbol set for variables includes the lower and upper case Roman letters as well as many from the Greek alphabet.

==Fundamental functions of propositions==
The four fundamental functions are the ''contradictory function'', the ''logical sum'', the ''logical product'', and the ''implicative function''.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contradictory function===
The contradictory function applied to a proposition returns its negation.
:&lt;math&gt;\sim p&lt;/math&gt;

===Logical sum===
The logical sum applied to two propositions returns their disjunction.
:&lt;math&gt;p \lor q&lt;/math&gt;

===Logical product===
The logical product applied to two propositions returns the [[truth-value]] of both propositions being simultaneously true.
:&lt;math&gt;p \cdot q&lt;/math&gt;

===Implicative function===
The implicative function applied to two ordered propositions returns the truth value of the first implying the second proposition.
:&lt;math&gt;p \supset q&lt;/math&gt;

==More complex functions of propositions==
''Equivalence'' is written as &lt;math&gt;p \equiv q&lt;/math&gt;, standing for &lt;math&gt;p \supset q \cdot q \supset p&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

''Assertion'' is same as the making of a statement between two full stops.
:&lt;math&gt;\vdash p&lt;/math&gt;
An asserted proposition is either true or an error on the part of the writer.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

''Inference'' is equivalent to the rule ''modus ponens'', where &lt;math&gt;p \cdot p \supset q . \supset q&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the logical product, ''dots'' are also used to show groupings of functions of propositions. In the above example, the dot before the final implication function symbol groups all of the previous functions on that line together as the antecedent to the final consequent.

The notation includes ''definitions'' as complex functions of propositions, using the equals sign "=" to separate the defined term from its symbolic definition, ending with the letters "Df".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ProbOnto''' is a [[knowledge base]] and [[ontology (information_science) | ontology]] of [[probability distribution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27153608 | doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btw170 | pmc=5013898  | volume=32 | title=ProbOnto: ontology and knowledge base of probability distributions | year=2016 | journal=Bioinformatics | page=2719 | last1 = Swat | first1 = MJ | last2 = Grenon | first2 = P | last3 = Wimalaratne | first3 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="probontoWebsite"&gt;Main project website, URL: http://probonto.org&lt;/ref&gt; ProbOnto 2.5 (released on January 16, 2017) contains over 150 [[Univariate distribution|uni]]- and [[multivariate distribution]]s and alternative parameterizations, more than 220 relationships and re-parameterization formulas, supporting also the encoding of empirical and univariate [[mixture distribution]]s.

== Introduction ==
ProbOnto was initially designed to facilitate the encoding of [[Mixed model|nonlinear-mixed effect models]] and their annotation in Pharmacometrics Markup Language (PharmML)&lt;ref&gt;Swat MJ. et al. (2015). Pharmacometrics Markup Language (PharmML): Opening New Perspectives for Model Exchange in Drug Development. CPT Pharmacometrics Syst Pharmacol, 4(6):316-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PharmML website, URL: http://pharmml.org&lt;/ref&gt; developed by DDMoRe,&lt;ref&gt;DDMoRe project website, URL: http://ddmore.eu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ProbOnto description on the DDMoRe website, URL: http://ddmore.eu/probonto&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Innovative Medicines Initiative]] project. However, ProbOnto, due to its generic structure can be applied in other platforms and modeling tools for encoding and annotation of diverse models applicable to discrete (e.g. [[Count data|count]], categorical and [[Survival analysis|time-to-event]]) and continuous data.

== Knowledge base ==
[[File:ProbOnto2.5.jpg|thumb|300px|Overview of supported distributions in ProbOnto, version 2.5, and relationships between univariate probability distributions.]]
The knowledge base stores for each distribution:
* [[Probability density function|Probability density]] or [[Probability mass function|mass]] functions and where available [[Cumulative distribution function|cumulative distribution]], [[Hazard function|hazard]] and [[Survival function|survival]] functions.
* Related quantities such as mean, median, mode and variance. 
* [[Statistical parameter|Parameter]] and [[Support (mathematics)|support]]/range definitions and distribution type.
* [[LaTeX]] and [[R (programming language)|R]] code for mathematical functions.
* Model definition and references.

=== Relationships ===
ProbOnto stores in Version 2.5 over 220 relationships between univariate distributions with re-parameterizations as a special case, see figure. While this form of relationships is often neglected in literature, and the authors concentrate one a particular form for each distribution, they are crucial from the interoperability point of view. ProbOnto focuses on this aspect and features more than 15 distributions with alternative parameterizations.

=== Alternative parameterizations ===
Many distributions are defined with mathematically equivalent but algebraically different formulas. This leads to issues when exchanging models between software tools.&lt;ref&gt;
LeBauer DS et al. Translating probability density functions: From R to BUGS and back again, R Journal, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The following examples illustrate that.

==== Normal distribution ====
[[Normal distribution]] can be defined in at least three ways 
* Normal1(μ,σ) with [[mean]], μ, and [[standard deviation]], σ &lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;Forbes et al. Probability Distributions (2011), John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(x;\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\sigma)= \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}\exp\Big[-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\Big]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
* Normal2(μ,υ) with mean, μ, and [[variance]], υ = σ^2&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram Mathworld, URL: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalDistribution.html&lt;/ref&gt; or
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(x;\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol v)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{v} \sqrt{2 \pi}}\exp\Big[-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2v}\Big]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
* Normal3(μ,τ) with mean, μ, and [[precision (statistics)|precision]], τ = 1/υ = 1/σ^2.&lt;ref&gt;'LaplacesDemon' R package, URL: http://search.r-project.org/library/LaplacesDemon/html/dist.Normal.Precision.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyert RM, MH DeGroot, Bayesian Analysis and Uncertainty in Economic (1987), TheoryRowman &amp; Littlefield&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(x;\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\tau)= \sqrt{\frac{\tau}{2 \pi}} \Big[-\frac{\tau}{2}(x-\mu)^2\Big]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


===== Re-parameterization formulas =====
The following formulas can be used to re-calculate the three different forms of the normal distribution (we use abbreviations i.e. &lt;math&gt;N1&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;Normal1&lt;/math&gt; etc.)
* &lt;math&gt;N1(\mu,\sigma) \rightarrow N2(\mu,v): v=\sigma^2 \mbox{ and } N2(\mu,v) \rightarrow N1(\mu,\sigma): \sigma=\sqrt{v};&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;N1(\mu,\sigma) \rightarrow N3(\mu,\tau): \tau=1/\sigma^2 \mbox{ and } N3(\mu,\tau) \rightarrow N1(\mu,\sigma): \sigma=1/\sqrt{\tau};&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;N2(\mu,v) \rightarrow N3(\mu,\tau): \tau=1/v \mbox{ and } N3(\mu,\tau) \rightarrow N2(\mu,v): v=1/\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

==== Log-normal distribution ====
In the case of the [[log-normal distribution]] there are more options. This is due to the fact that it can be parameterized in terms of parameters on the natural and log scale, see figure.[[File:LogNormal17.jpg|thumb|400px|Overview of parameterizations of the log-normal distributions.]] 
[[File:LNrelationships.png|thumb|400px|Support of different parameterizations of the log-normal distributions in various tools and there connections, see text for examples. Tools visualised are [[Matlab]] (supports LN1), [[MCSim]] (LN6), Monolix (LN2 &amp; LN3), PFIM (LN2 &amp; LN3), Phoenix NLME (LN1, LN3 &amp; LN6), PopED (LN7), [[R (programming language)]] (LN1), [[Simcyp Simulator]] (LN1), Simulx (LN1) and [[winBUGS]] (LN5)]] 
The available forms in ProbOnto 2.0 are
* LogNormal1(μ,σ) with mean, μ, and standard deviation, σ, both on the log-scale&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(x;\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\sigma)= \frac{1}{x \sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp\Big[ \frac{-(\log x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\Big]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
* LogNormal2(μ,υ) with mean, μ, and variance, υ, both on the log-scale
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(x;\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol {v})=\frac{1}{x \sqrt{v} \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp\Big[ \frac{-(\log x - \mu)^2}{2 v}\Big]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
* LogNormal3(m,σ) with [[median]], m, on the natural scale and standard deviation, σ, on the log-scale&lt;ref name="Forbes" /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(x;\boldsymbol m,\boldsymbol \sigma) =\frac{1}{x \sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp\Big[ \frac{-[\log(x/m)]^2}{2\sigma^2}\Big]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
* LogNormal4(m,cv) with median, m, and [[coefficient of variation]], cv, both on the natural scale
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(x;\boldsymbol m,\boldsymbol {cv})= \frac{1}{x \sqrt{\log(cv^2+1)} \sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp\Big[ \frac{-[\log(x/m)]^2}{2\log(cv^2+1)}\Big]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
* LogNormal5(μ,τ) with mean, μ, and precision, τ, both on the log-scale&lt;ref&gt;Lunn, D. (2012). The BUGS book: a practical introduction to Bayesian analysis. Texts in
statistical science. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(x;\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol \tau)=\sqrt{\frac{\tau}{2 \pi}} \frac{1}{x} \exp\Big[ {-\frac{\tau}{2}(\log x-\mu)^2} \Big] &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
* LogNormal6(m,σ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) with median, m, and [[geometric standard deviation]], σ&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;, both on the natural scale&lt;ref&gt;Limpert, E., Stahel, W. A., and Abbt, M. (2001). Log-normal distributions across the sciences: Keys and clues. BioScience, 51(5):341-352.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(x;\boldsymbol m,\boldsymbol {\sigma_g})=\frac{1}{x \log(\sigma_g)\sqrt{2 \pi}} \exp\Big[ \frac{-[\log(x/m)]^2}{2 \log^2(\sigma_g)}\Big]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
* LogNormal7(μ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;,σ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;) with mean, μ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, and standard deviation, σ&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;, both on the natural scale&lt;ref&gt;Nyberg J. et al. (2012) PopED - An extended, parallelized, population optimal design tool. Comput Methods Programs Biomed.; 108(2):789-805. doi: 10.1016/j.cmpb.2012.05.005&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(x;\boldsymbol {\mu_N},\boldsymbol {\sigma_N})= \frac{1}{x \sqrt{2 \pi \log\Big(1+\sigma_N^2/\mu_N^2\Big)}} \exp\Bigg( \frac{-\Big[ \log(x) - \log\Big(\frac{\mu_N}{\sqrt{1+\sigma_N^2/\mu_N^2}}\Big)\Big]^2}{2\log\Big(1+\sigma_N^2/\mu_N^2\Big)}\Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

ProbOnto knowledge base stores such re-parameterization formulas to allow for a correct translation of models between tools.

===== Examples for re-parameterization =====
Let's consider the situation when one would like to run a model using two different optimal design tools, e.g. PFIM&lt;ref&gt;Retout S, Duffull S, Mentré F (2001) Development and implementation of the population Fisher information matrix for the evaluation of population pharmacokinetic designs. Comp Meth Pro  Biomed 65:141–151&lt;/ref&gt; and PopED.&lt;ref&gt;The PopED Development Team (2016). PopED Manual, Release version 2.13. Technical report, Uppsala University.&lt;/ref&gt; The former supports the LN2, the latter LN7 parameterization, respectively. Therefore, the re-parameterization is required, otherwise the two tools would produce different results.

For the transition &lt;math&gt;LN2(\mu, v) \rightarrow LN7(\mu_N, \sigma_N)&lt;/math&gt; following formulas hold
&lt;math&gt;\mu_N = \exp(\mu+v/2) \text{ and } \sigma_N = \exp(\mu+v/2)\sqrt{\exp(v)-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

For the transition  &lt;math&gt;LN7(\mu_N, \sigma_N) \rightarrow LN2(\mu, v)&lt;/math&gt; following formulas hold
&lt;math&gt;\mu = \log\Big( \mu_N/\sqrt{1+\sigma_N^2/\mu_N^2} \Big) \text{ and } v = \log(1+\sigma_N^2/\mu_N^2)&lt;/math&gt;.

All remaining re-parameterisation formulas can be found in the specification document on the project website.&lt;ref name="probontoWebsite" /&gt;

== Ontology == 
The knowledge base is built from a simple ontological model. At its core, a probability distribution is an instance of the class thereof, a specialization of the class of mathematical objects. A distribution relates to a number of other individuals, which are instances of various categories in the ontology. For example, these are parameters and related functions associated with a given probability distribution. This strategy allows for the rich representation of attributes and relationships between domain objects. The ontology can be seen as a conceptual schema in the domain of mathematics and has been implemented as a PowerLoom knowledge base.&lt;ref&gt;MacGregor R. et al. (1997) Powerloom Manual. ISI, University of South California, Marina del Rey.&lt;/ref&gt; An OWL version is generated programmatically using the Jena API.&lt;ref&gt;McBride B. (2001) Jena: Implementing the RDF model and syntax specification. In: SemWeb.&lt;/ref&gt;

Output for ProbOnto are provided as supplementary materials and published on or linked from the probonto.org website. The OWL version of ProbOnto is available via Ontology Lookup Service (OLS)&lt;ref&gt;ProbOnto on Ontology Lookup Service, URL: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/probonto&lt;/ref&gt; to facilitate simple searching and visualization of the content. In addition the OLS API provides methods to programmatically access ProbOnto and to integrate it into applications. ProbOnto is also registered on the BioSharing portal.&lt;ref&gt;ProbOnto on BioSharing, the database of biological databases, URL: https://biosharing.org/biodbcore-000772&lt;/ref&gt;

== ProbOnto in PharmML ==
A PharmML interface is provided in form of a generic XML schema for the definition of the distributions and their parameters. Defining functions, such as probability density function (PDF), probability mass function (PMF), hazard function (HF) and survival function (SF), can be accessed via methods provided in the PharmML schema.

=== Use example ===
This example shows how the zero-inflated Poisson distribution is encoded by using its ''codename'' and declaring that of its parameters (‘rate’ and ‘probabilityOfZero’). Model parameters ''Lambda'' and ''P0'' are assigned to the parameter code names.

&lt;source lang="XML"&gt;
            &lt;Distribution&gt;
               &lt;po:ProbOnto name="ZeroInflatedPoisson1"&gt;
                  &lt;po:Parameter name="rate"&gt;
                     &lt;ct:Assign&gt;
                        &lt;ct:SymbRef symbIdRef="Lambda"/&gt;
                     &lt;/ct:Assign&gt;
                  &lt;/po:Parameter&gt;
                  &lt;po:Parameter name="probabilityOfZero"&gt;
                     &lt;ct:Assign&gt;
                        &lt;ct:SymbRef symbIdRef="P0"/&gt;
                     &lt;/ct:Assign&gt;
                  &lt;/po:Parameter&gt;
               &lt;/po:ProbOnto&gt;
            &lt;/Distribution&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
To specify any given distribution unambiguously using ProbOnto, it is sufficient to declare its code name and the code names of its parameters.
More examples and a detailed specification can be found on the project website.&lt;ref name="probontoWebsite" /&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''quasi-Lie algebra''' in [[abstract algebra]] is just like a [[Lie algebra]], but with the usual [[axiom]] 

:&lt;math&gt;[x,x]=0&lt;/math&gt;

replaced by 

:&lt;math&gt;[x,y]=-[y,x]&lt;/math&gt; (anti-symmetry).

In [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] other than 2, these are equivalent (in the presence of [[bilinear operator|bilinearity]]), so this distinction doesn't arise when considering real or complex Lie algebras. It can however become important, when considering ''Lie algebras'' over the integers.

In a quasi-Lie algebra, 

:&lt;math&gt;2[x,x]=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore the bracket of any element with itself is 2-torsion, if it does not actually vanish.

'''''Reptiles''''' is a [[Lithography|lithograph]] [[printmaking|print]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[M. C. Escher]] first printed in March 1943.

It depicts a desk upon which is a 2D drawing of a [[Tessellation|tessellated]] pattern of reptiles and hexagons. The reptiles at one edge of the drawing emerge into three dimensional reality, come to life and appear to crawl over a series of symbolic objects (a book on nature, a geometers triangle, a three dimensional/pentagonal dodecahedron, a pewter bowl containing a box of matches and a box of cigarettes) to eventually re-enter the drawing at its opposite edge.  Other objects on the desk that may also be symbolic are a potted cactus and yucca, a ceramic flask with a cork stopper next to a small glass of liquid, a book of JOB cigarette rolling papers, and an open handwritten note book of many pages. Although only the size of small lizards, the reptiles have protruding crocodile-like fangs, and the one atop the dodecahedron has a dragon-like puff of smoke billowing from its nostrils.

Like many of Escher's works, the meaning of the imagery is enigmatic. There are, however, a number of scholarly interpretations of the work. One is that the lizard represents man, emerging from pure concept in two dimensions, becoming a three dimensional being, groping through life acquiring knowledge and wisdom, arriving at deep understanding of science and sacred geometric principals and the alchemical/spiritual nature of reality and existence, and finally descending to reunion with the realm of pure concept. In this theory the objects around the edge of the drawing are signals of the stages of emergence (cactus, biological life), the beginning of the fire-quest for knowledge (rolling papers), contemplation and distillation (a jug and partially consumed glass of spirits), deep study, understanding and wisdom (the open well-used notebook), and re-integration (matches and cigarettes symbolizing controlled/civilized fire that nonetheless consumes and returns the physical to the abstract).

Once a woman telephoned Escher and told him that she thought the image was a "striking illustration of [[reincarnation]]".

==In popular culture==
A colorized version of the lithograph was used by rock band [[Mott the Hoople]] as the sleeve artwork for its [[Mott the Hoople (album)|eponymous first album]], released in 1969.

In [[control theory|control system theory]], the '''Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion''' is a mathematical test that is a necessary and sufficient condition  for the [[stable polynomial|stability]] of a [[linear function|linear]] [[time invariant]] (LTI) [[control system]]. The Routh test is an efficient recursive algorithm that English mathematician [[Edward John Routh]] proposed in 1876 to determine whether all the [[root of a function|roots]] of the [[characteristic polynomial]] of a [[linear system]] have negative real parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Routh |first=E. J. |year=1877 |title=A Treatise on the Stability of a Given State of Motion: Particularly Steady Motion |publisher=Macmillan |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; German mathematician [[Adolf Hurwitz]] independently proposed in 1895 to arrange the coefficients of the polynomial into a square matrix, called the Hurwitz matrix, and showed that the polynomial is stable if and only if the sequence of determinants of its principal submatrices are all positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hurwitz |first=A. |year=1895 |title=Ueber die Bedingungen, unter welchen eine Gleichung nur Wurzeln mit negativen reellen Theilen besitzt |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen|Math. Ann.]] |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=273–284 |doi=10.1007/BF01446812 }} (English translation “On the conditions under which an equation has only roots with negative real parts” by H. G. Bergmann in ''Selected Papers on Mathematical Trends in Control Theory'' R. Bellman and R. Kalaba Eds. New York: Dover, 1964 pp. 70–82.)&lt;/ref&gt; The two procedures are equivalent, with the Routh test providing a more efficient way to compute the Hurwitz determinants than computing them directly.  A polynomial satisfying the Routh–Hurwitz criterion is called a [[Hurwitz polynomial]].

The importance of the criterion is that the roots '''''p''''' of the characteristic equation of a [[linear system]] with negative real parts represent solutions '''''e&lt;sup&gt;pt&lt;/sup&gt;''''' of the system that are stable ([[BIBO stability|bounded]]).  Thus the criterion provides a way to determine if the [[equations of motion]] of a [[linear system]] have only stable solutions, without solving the system directly.  For discrete systems, the corresponding stability test can be handled by the Schur–Cohn criterion, the [[Jury stability criterion|Jury test]] and the [[Bistritz stability criterion|Bistritz test]].  With the advent of computers, the criterion has become less widely used, as an alternative is to solve the polynomial numerically, obtaining approximations to the roots directly.

The Routh test can [[Derivation of the Routh array|be derived]] through the use of the [[euclid's algorithm|Euclidean algorithm]] and [[Sturm's theorem]] in evaluating [[cauchy index|Cauchy indices]]. Hurwitz derived his conditions differently.&lt;ref name="Gopal"&gt;{{cite book

==Using Euclid's algorithm==

The criterion is related to [[Routh–Hurwitz theorem]].  Indeed, from the statement of that theorem, we have &lt;math&gt;p-q=w(+\infty)-w(-\infty)&lt;/math&gt; where:
* ''p'' is the number of roots of the polynomial ''ƒ''(''z'') with negative real Part;
* ''q'' is the number of roots of the polynomial ''ƒ''(''z'') with positive real Part (let us remind ourselves that ''ƒ'' is supposed to have no roots lying on the imaginary line);
* ''w''(''x'') is the number of variations of the [[Sturm's theorem#Generalized Sturm chains|generalized Sturm chain]] obtained from &lt;math&gt;P_0(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_1(y)&lt;/math&gt; (by successive [[Euclid's algorithm|Euclidean divisions]]) where &lt;math&gt;f(iy)=P_0(y)+iP_1(y)&lt;/math&gt; for a real ''y''.
By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], each polynomial of degree ''n'' must have ''n'' roots in the complex plane (i.e., for an ''ƒ'' with no roots on the imaginary line, ''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n'').  Thus, we have the condition that ''ƒ'' is a (Hurwitz) [[stable polynomial]] if and only if ''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n'' (the [[Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion#Appendix A|proof]] is given below).  Using the Routh–Hurwitz theorem, we can replace the condition on ''p'' and ''q'' by a condition on the generalized Sturm chain, which will give in turn a condition on the coefficients of&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''.

==Using matrices==

Let ''f''(''z'') be a complex polynomial.  The process is as follows:
# Compute the polynomials &lt;math&gt;P_0(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_1(y)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(iy)=P_0(y)+iP_1(y)&lt;/math&gt; where ''y'' is a real number.
# Compute the [[Sylvester matrix]] associated to  &lt;math&gt;P_0(y)&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;P_1(y)&lt;/math&gt;.
# Rearrange each row in such a way that an odd row and the following one have the same number of leading zeros.
# Compute each [[minor (linear algebra)|principal minor]] of that matrix.
# If at least one of the minors is negative (or zero), then the polynomial ''f'' is not stable.

===Example===

* Let &lt;math&gt;f(z)=az^2+bz+c&lt;/math&gt; (for the sake of simplicity we take real coefficients) where &lt;math&gt; c\neq 0&lt;/math&gt; (to avoid a root in zero so that we can use the Routh–Hurwitz theorem).  First, we have to calculate the real polynomials &lt;math&gt;P_0(y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_1(y)&lt;/math&gt;:
:: &lt;math&gt;f(iy)=-ay^2+iby+c=P_0(y)+iP_1(y)=-ay^2+c+i(by).&lt;/math&gt;
: Next, we divide those polynomials to obtain the generalized Sturm chain:
:* &lt;math&gt;P_0(y)=((-a/b)y)P_1(y)+c,&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt; P_2(y)=-c,&lt;/math&gt;
:* &lt;math&gt;P_1(y)=((-b/c)y)P_2(y),&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;P_3(y)=0&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Euclid's algorithm|Euclidean division]] stops.
Notice that we had to suppose ''b'' different from zero in the first division.  The generalized Sturm chain is in this case &lt;math&gt;(P_0(y),P_1(y),P_2(y))=(c-ay^2,by,-c)&lt;/math&gt;.  Putting &lt;math&gt;y=+\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the sign of &lt;math&gt;c-ay^2&lt;/math&gt; is the opposite sign of ''a'' and the sign of ''by'' is the sign of ''b''.  When we put &lt;math&gt;y=-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the sign of the first element of the chain is again the opposite sign of ''a'' and the sign of ''by'' is the opposite sign of ''b''.  Finally, -''c'' has always the opposite sign of ''c''.

Suppose now that ''f'' is Hurwitz-stable.  This means that &lt;math&gt;w(+\infty)-w(-\infty)=2&lt;/math&gt; (the degree of ''f'').  By the properties of the function ''w'', this is the same as &lt;math&gt;w(+\infty)=2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w(-\infty)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' must have the same sign.   We have thus found the [[stable polynomial#Properties|necessary condition of stability]] for polynomials of degree 2.

===Routh–Hurwitz criterion for second, third, and fourth-degree polynomial===

* For a second-degree polynomial, &lt;math&gt; P(s) = s^2 + a_1s + a_0  &lt;/math&gt;, all the roots are in the left half plane (and the system with characteristic equation &lt;math&gt; P(s) =0&lt;/math&gt; is stable) if and only if both coefficients satisfy &lt;math&gt; a_i &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.
* For a third-order polynomial &lt;math&gt; P(s) = s^3 + a_2s^2 + a_1s + a_0 &lt;/math&gt;, the conditions are that &lt;math&gt;a_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; must be positive, and &lt;math&gt; a_2a_1 &gt; a_0 .&lt;/math&gt;
* In general the Routh stability criterion states that all first-column elements of the Routh array are to be of the same sign.
Systems meeting the above criteria are said to be open-loop stable; otherwise, they are unstable because there are sign changes in the first-column elements.

===Higher-order example===

A tabular method can be used to determine the stability when the roots of a higher order characteristic polynomial are difficult to obtain. For an ''n''th-degree polynomial
* &lt;math&gt;D(s)=a_ns^n+a_{n-1}s^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1s+a_0&lt;/math&gt;
the table has ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 rows and the following structure:
{| class="wikitable" width="200px"
 | &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a_{n-4}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\dots&lt;/math&gt;
 |-
 | &lt;math&gt;a_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a_{n-3}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;a_{n-5}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\dots&lt;/math&gt;
 |-
 | &lt;math&gt;b_1&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;b_2&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;b_3&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\dots&lt;/math&gt;
 |-
 | &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;c_3&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\dots&lt;/math&gt;
 |-
 | &lt;math&gt;\vdots&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\vdots&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\vdots&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\ddots&lt;/math&gt;
 |}
where the elements &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; can be computed as follows:
* &lt;math&gt;b_i=\frac{a_{n-1}\times{a_{n-2i}}-a_n\times{a_{n-(2i+1)}}}{a_{n-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;c_i=\frac{b_1\times{a_{n-(2i+1)}}-a_{n-1}\times{b_{i+1}}}{b_1}.&lt;/math&gt;
When completed, the number of sign changes in the first column will be the number of non-negative roots.
{| class="wikitable"
 |-
 | width="40px" |0.75
 | width="40px" |1.5
 | width="40px" |0
 | width="40px" |0
 |-
 |&lt;nowiki&gt;-3&lt;/nowiki&gt;||6||0||0
 |-
 |3||0||0||0
 |-
 |6||0||0||0
|}
In the first column, there are two sign changes (0.75&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;−3, and −3&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;3), thus there are two non-negative roots where the system is unstable.

Sometimes the presence of poles on the imaginary axis creates a situation of marginal stability. In that case the coefficients of the "Routh array" in a whole row become zero and thus further solution of the polynomial for finding changes in sign is not possible. Then another approach comes into play. The row of polynomial which is just above the row containing the zeroes is called the "auxiliary polynomial".

* &lt;math&gt;s^6+2s^5+8s^4+12s^3+20s^2+16s+16=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;
We have the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
 |-
 | width="40px"|1|| width="40px"|8|| width="40px"|20|| width="40px"|16
 |-
 | 2    || 12  || 16 || 0
 |-
 | 2    || 12  || 16 || 0
 |-
 | 0    || 0   ||  0 || 0
 |}
In such a case the auxiliary polynomial is &lt;math&gt;A(s)=2s^4+12s^2+16.\,&lt;/math&gt; which is again equal to zero. The next step is to differentiate the above equation which yields the following polynomial. &lt;math&gt;B(s)=8s^3+24s^1.\,&lt;/math&gt;. The coefficients of the row containing zero now become
"8" and "24". The process of Routh array is proceeded using these values which yield two points on the imaginary axis. These two points on the imaginary axis are the prime cause of marginal stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saeed|first=Syed Hasan|title=Automatic Control Systems|year=2008|publisher=Katson Publishers|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-906919-2-5|pages=206, 207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12731">The '''SECD machine''' is a highly influential (''See: [[#Landin's contribution]]'') [[virtual machine]] and [[abstract machine]] intended as a target for [[functional programming|functional programming language]] compilers.  The letters stand for '''S'''tack, '''E'''nvironment, '''C'''ontrol, '''D'''ump, the internal registers of the machine.  The registers Stack, Control, and Dump point to (some realisations of) [[Stack_(abstract_data_type)|stacks]], and Environment points to (some realisation of) an [[associative array]].  

The machine was the first to be specifically designed to evaluate [[lambda calculus]] expressions.   It was originally described by [[Peter J. Landin]] in  "The Mechanical Evaluation of Expressions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Landin | first1 = P. J. | author1-link = Peter Landin| title = The Mechanical Evaluation of Expressions| doi = 10.1093/comjnl/6.4.308| journal = [[The Computer Journal|Comput. J.]]| volume = 6| issue = 4| pages = 308–320| date=January 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1964. The description published by Landin was fairly abstract, and left many implementation choices open (like an [[operational semantics]]). Hence the SECD machine is often presented in a more detailed form, such as [[Peter Henderson (programmer)|Peter Henderson]]'s [[Lispkit Lisp]] compiler, which has been distributed since 1980.  Since then it has been used as the target for several other experimental compilers.

In 1989 researchers at the [[University of Calgary]] worked on a hardware implementation of the machine.&lt;ref&gt;A paper on the design, [http://hdl.handle.net/1880/46590 SECD: DESIGN ISSUES] is available.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landin's contribution==
[[David Turner (computer scientist)|D. A. Turner]] (2012) &lt;ref name=tfp12&gt;[https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/tfp12/tfp12.pdf D. A. Turner "Some History of Functional Programming Languages" in an invited lecture '''TFP12''', St Andrews University, 12 June 2012. See the section on Algol 60]&lt;/ref&gt; points out that ''The Revised Report on Algol 60'' (Naur 1963) specifies a procedure call by a copying rule which avoids variable capture with a systematic change of identifiers. This method works in the Algol 60 implementation, but in a functional programming language where functions are first-class citizens, a free variable on a call stack might be dereferenced in error.

Turner notes that Landin solved this with his SECD machine, in which a function is represented by a [[closure (computer programming)|closure]] in the heap instead.&lt;ref name=tfp12 /&gt;

==Informal description==

When evaluation of an expression begins, the expression is loaded as the only element of control '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;'''. The environment '''&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;''', stack '''&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;''' and dump '''&lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt;''' begin empty.

During evaluation of '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;''' it is converted to [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN) with &lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt; (for [[apply]]) being the only operator. For example, the expression &lt;code&gt;F (G X)&lt;/code&gt; (a single list element) is changed to the list &lt;code&gt;X:G:ap:F:ap&lt;/code&gt;.

Evaluation of '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;''' proceeds similarly to other RPN expressions. If the first item in '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;''' is a value, it is pushed onto the stack '''&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;'''. More exactly, if the item is an identifier, the value pushed onto the stack will be the binding for that identifier in the current environment '''&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;'''. If the item is an abstraction, a [[closure (computer science)|closure]] is constructed to preserve the bindings of its free variables (which are in '''&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;'''), and it is this closure which is pushed onto the stack.

If the item is '''&lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt;''', two values are popped off the stack and the application done (first applied to second). If the result of the application is a value, it is pushed onto the stack.

If the application is of an abstraction to a value, however, it will result in a lambda calculus expression which may itself be an application (rather than a value), and so cannot be pushed onto the stack. In this case, the current contents of '''&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;''', '''&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;''', and '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;''' are pushed onto the dump '''&lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt;''' (which is a stack of these triples), '''&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;''' is reinitialised to empty, and '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;''' is reinitialised to the application result with '''&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;''' containing the environment for the free variables of this expression, augmented with the binding that resulted from the application. Evaluation then proceeds as above.

Completed evaluation is indicated by '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;''' being empty, in which case the result will be on the stack '''&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;'''. The last saved evaluation state on '''&lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt;''' is then popped, and the result of the completed evaluation is pushed onto the stack contents restored from '''&lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt;'''. Evaluation of the restored state then continues as above.

If '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;''' and '''&lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt;''' are both empty, overall evaluation has completed with the result on the stack '''&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;'''.

==Registers and memory==

The SECD machine is [[stack (data structure)|stack-based]]. Functions take their arguments from the stack. The arguments to built-in instructions are encoded immediately after them in the instruction stream.

Like all internal data-structures, the stack is a list, with the '''&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;''' register pointing at the list's ''head'' or beginning. Due to the list structure, the stack need not be a continuous block of memory, so stack space is available as long as there is a single free memory cell. Even when all cells have been used, [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] may yield additional free memory. Obviously, specific implementations of the SECD structure can implement the stack as a canonical stack structure, so improving the overall efficiency of the virtual machine, provided that a strict bound be put on the dimension of the stack.

The '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;''' register points at the head of the code or instruction list that will be evaluated. Once the instruction there has been executed, the '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;''' is pointed at the next instruction in the list—it is similar to an ''instruction pointer'' (or [[program counter]]) in conventional machines, except that subsequent instructions are always specified during execution and are not by default contained in subsequent memory locations, as it is the case with the conventional machines.

The current variable environment is managed by the '''&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;''' register, which points at a list of lists. Each individual list represents one environment level: the parameters of the current function are in the head of the list, variables that are free in the current function, but bound by a surrounding function, are in other elements of '''&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;'''.

The dump, at whose head the '''&lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt;''' register points, is used as temporary storage for values of the other registers, for example during function calls. It can be likened to the return stack of other machines.

The memory organization of the SECD machine is similar to the model used by most functional language [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreters]]: a number of memory cells, each of which can hold either an ''atom'' (a simple value, for example ''13''), or represent an empty or non-empty list. In the latter case, the cell holds two pointers to other cells, one representing the first element, the other representing the list except for the first element. The two pointers are traditionally named [[CAR and CDR|''car'' and ''cdr'']] respectively—but the more modern terms ''head'' and ''tail'' are often used instead. The different types of values that a cell can hold are distinguished by a ''[[Tagged architecture|tag]]''. Often different types of atoms (integers, strings, etc.) are distinguished as well.

So, a list holding the numbers ''1'', ''2'', and ''3'', usually written as &lt;code&gt;(1 2 3)&lt;/code&gt;, might be represented as follows:

 Address   Tag       Content (value for integers, car &amp; cdr for lists)
 
       9 [ integer |     2 ]
       8 [ integer |     3 ]
       7 [ list    | 8 | 0 ]
       6 [ list    | 9 | 7 ]
       ...
       2 [ list    | 1 | 6 ]
       1 [ integer |     1 ]
       0 [ nil             ]

The memory cells 3 to 5 do not belong to our list, the cells of which can be distributed randomly over the memory.  Cell 2 is the head of the list, it points to cell 1 which holds the first element's value, and the list containing only ''2'' and ''3'' (beginning at cell 6). Cell 6 points at a cell holding 2 and at cell 7, which represents the list containing only ''3''.  It does so by pointing at cell 8 containing the value ''3'', and pointing at an empty list (''nil'') as cdr.  In the SECD machine, cell 0 always implicitly represents the empty list, so no special tag value is needed to signal an empty list (everything needing that can simply point to cell 0).

The principle that the cdr in a list cell must point at another list is just a convention. If both car and cdr point at atoms, that will yield a pair, usually written like &lt;code&gt;(1 . 2)&lt;/code&gt;

==Instructions==

* '''&lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt;''' pushes a nil pointer onto the stack
* '''&lt;code&gt;ldc&lt;/code&gt;''' pushes a constant argument onto the stack
* '''&lt;code&gt;ld&lt;/code&gt;''' pushes the value of a variable onto the stack. The variable is indicated by the argument, a pair. The pair's car specifies the level, the cdr the position. So &lt;code&gt;(1 . 3)&lt;/code&gt; gives the current function's (level 1) third parameter.
* '''&lt;code&gt;sel&lt;/code&gt;''' expects two list arguments, and pops a value from the stack. The first list is executed if the popped value was non-nil, the second list otherwise. Before one of these list pointers is made the new '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;''', a pointer to the instruction following '''&lt;math&gt;sel&lt;/math&gt;''' is saved on the dump.
* '''&lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt;''' pops a list reference from the dump and makes this the new value of '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;'''. This instruction occurs at the end of both alternatives of a '''&lt;code&gt;sel&lt;/code&gt;'''.
* '''&lt;code&gt;ldf&lt;/code&gt;''' takes one list argument representing a function. It constructs a closure (a pair containing the function and the current environment) and pushes that onto the stack.
* '''&lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt;''' pops a closure and a list of parameter values from the stack. The closure is applied to the parameters by installing its environment as the current one, pushing the parameter list in front of that, clearing the stack, and setting '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;''' to the closure's function pointer. The previous values of '''&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;''', '''&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;''', and the next value of '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;''' are saved on the dump.
* '''&lt;code&gt;ret&lt;/code&gt;''' pops one return value from the stack, restores '''&lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt;''', '''&lt;code&gt;E&lt;/code&gt;''', and '''&lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt;''' from the dump, and pushes the return value onto the now-current stack.
* '''&lt;code&gt;dum&lt;/code&gt;''' pushes a "dummy", an empty list, in front of the environment list.
* '''&lt;code&gt;rap&lt;/code&gt;''' works like '''&lt;math&gt;ap&lt;/math&gt;''', only that it replaces an occurrence of a dummy environment with the current one, thus making recursive functions possible

A number of additional instructions for basic functions like car, cdr, list construction, integer addition, I/O, etc. exist. They all take any necessary parameters from the stack.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35486">In [[mathematics]], a '''Sobolev space''' is a [[vector space]] of functions equipped with a [[normed space|norm]] that is a combination of [[Lp norm|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-norms]] of the function itself and its derivatives up to a given order. The derivatives are understood in a suitable [[weak derivative|weak sense]] to make the space [[Complete metric space|complete]], thus a [[Banach space]]. Intuitively, a Sobolev space is a space of functions with sufficiently many derivatives for some application domain, such as [[partial differential equation]]s, and equipped with a norm that measures both the size and regularity of a function.

Sobolev spaces are named after the Russian [[mathematician]] [[Sergei Lvovich Sobolev|Sergei Sobolev]]. Their importance comes from the fact that solutions of partial differential equations are naturally found in Sobolev spaces, rather than in spaces of [[continuous function]]s and with the [[derivative]]s understood in the classical sense.

==Motivation==

In this section and throughout the article &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an [[open subset]] of &lt;math&gt;\R^n.&lt;/math&gt;

There are many criteria for smoothness of [[mathematical function]]s. The most basic criterion may be that of [[continuous function|continuity]]. A stronger notion of smoothness is that of [[differentiability]] (because functions that are differentiable are also continuous) and a yet stronger notion of smoothness is that the derivative also be continuous (these functions are said to be of class ''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;mdash; see [[Differentiability class]]). Differentiable functions are important in many areas, and in particular for [[differential equation]]s. In the twentieth century, however, it was observed that the space ''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (or ''C''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, etc.) was not exactly the right space to study solutions of differential equations. The Sobolev spaces are the modern replacement for these spaces in which to look for solutions of partial differential equations.

Quantities or properties of the underlying model of the differential equation are usually expressed in terms of integral norms, rather than the [[uniform norm]]. A typical example is measuring the energy of a temperature or velocity distribution by an ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-norm. It is therefore important to develop a tool for differentiating [[Lp space|Lebesgue space]] functions.

The [[integration by parts]] formula yields that for every  ''u'' ∈ ''C&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω), where ''k'' is a [[natural number]], and for all infinitely differentiable functions with [[compact support]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in C_c^{\infty}(\Omega),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \int_\Omega uD^\alpha\varphi\;dx=(-1)^{|\alpha|}\int_\Omega \varphi D^\alpha u\;dx,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''α'' a [[multi-index]] of order |''α''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k'' and we are using the notation:

:&lt;math&gt;D^{\alpha}f = \frac{\partial^{| \alpha |} f}{\partial x_{1}^{\alpha_{1}} \dots \partial x_{n}^{\alpha_{n}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The left-hand side of this equation still makes sense if we only assume ''u'' to be [[locally integrable]]. If there exists a locally integrable function ''v'', such that

:&lt;math&gt; \int_\Omega uD^\alpha\varphi\;dx=(-1)^{|\alpha|}\int_\Omega \varphi v \;dx, \qquad\varphi\in C_c^\infty(\Omega),&lt;/math&gt;

we call ''v'' the [[weak derivative|weak ''α''-th partial derivative]] of ''u''. If there exists a weak ''α''-th partial derivative of ''u'', then it is uniquely defined [[almost everywhere]], and thus it is uniquely determined as an element of a [[Lp space|Lebesgue space]]. On the other hand, if ''u''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''C&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω), then the classical and the weak derivative coincide. Thus, if ''v'' is a weak ''α''-th partial derivative of ''u'', we may denote it by ''D&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;u''&amp;nbsp;:=&amp;nbsp;''v''.

For example, the function

:&lt;math&gt;u(x)=\begin{cases}
1+x &amp; -1&lt;x&lt;0 \\
10 &amp; x=0\\
1-x &amp; 0&lt;x&lt;1\\
0 &amp; \text{else}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

is not continuous at zero, and not differentiable at −1, 0, or 1. Yet the function

:&lt;math&gt;v(x)=\begin{cases}
1 &amp;  -1&lt;x&lt;0 \\
-1 &amp;  0&lt;x&lt;1\\
0 &amp; \text{else}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

satisfies the definition for being the weak derivative of &lt;math&gt;u(x)&lt;/math&gt;, which then qualifies as being in the Sobolev space &lt;math&gt;W^{1,p}&lt;/math&gt; (for any allowed ''p'', see definition below).

The Sobolev spaces ''W&lt;sup&gt;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω) combine the concepts of weak differentiability and [[Lp norm|Lebesgue norms]].

==Sobolev spaces with integer ''k''==

===One-dimensional case===
In the one-dimensional case (functions on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;) the Sobolev space {{math|''W&lt;sup&gt;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} is defined to be the subset of functions {{mvar|f}} in [[Lp space|&lt;math&gt;L^p(\mathbb{R})&lt;/math&gt;]] such that the function {{mvar|f}} and its [[weak derivative]]s up to some order {{mvar|k}} have a finite [[Lp norm|{{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} norm]], for given {{math|''p'' (1 ≤ ''p'' ≤ +∞)}}. As mentioned above, some care must be taken to define derivatives in the proper sense. In the one-dimensional problem it is enough to assume that {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;(''k''−1)&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the {{math|(''k'' − 1)}}-th derivative of the function {{mvar|f}}, is differentiable almost everywhere and is equal almost everywhere to the [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integral]] of its derivative (this gets rid of examples such as [[Cantor function|Cantor's function]] which are irrelevant to what the definition is trying to accomplish).

With this definition, the Sobolev spaces admit a natural [[Normed vector space|norm]],

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{k,p} = \left (\sum_{i=0}^k \left \|f^{(i)} \right \|_p^p \right)^{\frac{1}{p}} = \left (\sum_{i=0}^k \int \left |f^{(i)}(t) \right |^p\,dt \right )^{\frac{1}{p}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equipped with the norm {{math|{{!!}} ⋅ {{!!}}&lt;sub&gt;''k,p''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} becomes a [[Banach space]]. It turns out that it is enough to take only the first and last in the sequence, i.e., the norm defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\left \|f^{(k)} \right \|_p + \|f\|_p&lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to the norm above (i.e. the [[Normed vector space#Topological structure|induced topologies]] of the norms are the same).

====The case {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}====
Sobolev spaces with {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} are especially important because of their connection with [[Fourier series]] and because they form a [[Hilbert space]]. A special notation has arisen to cover this case, since the space is a Hilbert space:

:{{math|''H&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} ''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''k'',2&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

The space {{math|''H&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k&lt;/sup&gt;''}} can be defined naturally in terms of [[Fourier series]] whose coefficients decay sufficiently rapidly, namely,

:&lt;math&gt;H^k({\mathbb T}) = \left \{ f\in L^2({\mathbb T}) : \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \left (1+n^2 + n^4 + \dots + n^{2k} \right ) \left |\widehat{f}(n) \right |^2 &lt; \infty \right \}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\widehat{f}&lt;/math&gt; is the Fourier series of {{mvar|f}}, and &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb T}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the 1-torus. As above, one can use the equivalent norm

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|^2_{k,2}=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \left (1 + |n|^{2} \right )^k \left |\widehat{f}(n) \right |^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Both representations follow easily from [[Parseval's theorem]] and the fact that differentiation is equivalent to multiplying the Fourier coefficient by ''in''.

Furthermore, the space {{math|''H&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k&lt;/sup&gt;''}} admits an [[inner product space|inner product]], like the space {{math|''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;0&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. In fact, the {{math|''H&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k&lt;/sup&gt;''}} inner product is defined in terms of the {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} inner product:

:&lt;math&gt;\langle u,v\rangle_{H^k} = \sum_{i=0}^k \left \langle D^i u,D^i v \right \rangle_{L^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The space {{math|''H&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k&lt;/sup&gt;''}} becomes a Hilbert space with this inner product.

====Other examples====
Some other Sobolev spaces permit a simpler description. For example, {{math|''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;(0, 1)}} is the space of [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous functions]] on {{math|(0, 1)}} (or rather, equivalence classes of functions that are equal almost everywhere to such), while {{math|''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1,∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''I'')}} is the space of [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz functions]] on {{mvar|I}}, for every interval {{mvar|I}}. All spaces {{math|''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''k'',∞&lt;/sup&gt;}} are (normed) [[algebra over a field|algebra]]s, i.e. the product of two elements is once again a function of this Sobolev space, which is not the case for {{math|''p'' &lt; +∞}}. (E.g., functions behaving like |''x''|&lt;sup&gt;−1/3&lt;/sup&gt; at the origin are in {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, but the product of two such functions is not in {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}).

===Multidimensional case===
The transition to multiple dimensions brings more difficulties, starting from the very definition. The requirement that {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;(''k''−1)&lt;/sup&gt;}} be the integral of {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} does not generalize, and the simplest solution is to consider derivatives in the sense of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution theory]].

A formal definition now follows. Let &lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{N}, p \in [1, \infty].&lt;/math&gt; The Sobolev space {{math|''W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω)}} is defined to be the set of all functions {{mvar|f}} defined on {{math|Ω}} such that for every [[multi-index]] {{mvar|α}} with {{math|{{!}}''α''{{!}} ≤ ''k''}}, the mixed [[partial derivative]]

:&lt;math&gt;f^{(\alpha)} = \frac{\partial^{| \alpha |} f}{\partial x_{1}^{\alpha_{1}} \dots \partial x_{n}^{\alpha_{n}}}&lt;/math&gt;

exists in the [[weak derivative|weak]] sense and is in {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω)}}, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\left \|f^{(\alpha)} \right \|_{L^{p}} &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the Sobolev space {{math|''W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω)}} is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; W^{k,p}(\Omega) = \left \{ u \in L^p(\Omega) : D^{\alpha}u \in L^p(\Omega) \,\, \forall |\alpha| \leqslant k \right \}. &lt;/math&gt;

The [[natural number]] {{mvar|k}} is called the order of the Sobolev space {{math|''W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω)}}.

There are several choices for a norm for {{math|''W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω)}}.  The following two are common and are equivalent in the sense of [[Norm (mathematics)#Properties|equivalence of norms]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\| u \|_{W^{k, p}(\Omega)} := \begin{cases} 
\left( \sum_{|\alpha | \leqslant k} \left \| D^{\alpha}u \right \|_{L^p(\Omega)}^p \right)^{\frac{1}{p}} &amp; 1 \leqslant p &lt; +\infty; \\ 
\max_{| \alpha | \leqslant k} \left \| D^{\alpha}u \right \|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)}  &amp; p = +\infty; 
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\| u \|'_{W^{k, p}(\Omega)} := \begin{cases} 
\sum_{| \alpha | \leqslant k} \left \| D^{\alpha}u \right \|_{L^{p}(\Omega)}      &amp; 1 \leqslant p &lt; + \infty; \\ 
\sum_{| \alpha | \leqslant k} \left \| D^{\alpha}u \right \|_{L^{\infty}(\Omega)} &amp; p = + \infty. 
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

With respect to either of these norms, {{math|''W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω)}} is a Banach space.  For {{math|''p'' &lt; +∞}}, {{math|''W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω)}} is also a [[separable space]]. It is conventional to denote {{math|''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''k'',2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} by {{math|''H&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω)}} for it is a [[Hilbert space]] with the norm &lt;math&gt;\| \cdot \|_{W^{k, 2}(\Omega)} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|1998|loc=Chapter 5.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Approximation by smooth functions====
It is rather hard to work with Sobolev spaces relying only on their definition.  It is therefore interesting to know that by theorem of [[Norman George Meyers|Meyers]] and [[James Serrin|Serrin]] a function {{math|''u'' ∈ ''W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω)}} can be approximated by [[smooth functions]].  This fact often allows us to translate properties of smooth functions to Sobolev functions.
If {{mvar|p}} is finite and {{math|Ω}} is open, then  there exists for any {{math|''u'' ∈ ''W&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω)}} an approximating sequence of functions {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} such that:

:&lt;math&gt; \left \| u_m - u \right \|_{W^{k,p}(\Omega)} \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{math|Ω}} has [[Lipschitz boundary]], we may even assume that the {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are the restriction of smooth functions with compact support on all of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Adams1975"&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Examples====

In higher dimensions, it is no longer true that, for example, ''W''&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt; contains only continuous functions.  For example, 1/|''x''| belongs to &lt;math&gt;W^{1,1}(\mathbb{B}^3)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{B}^3&lt;/math&gt; is the [[unit ball]] in three dimensions.  For ''k'' &gt; ''n''/''p'' the space ''W&lt;sup&gt;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω) will contain only continuous functions, but for which ''k'' this is already true depends both on ''p'' and on the dimension.  For example, as can be easily checked using [[spherical polar coordinates]] for the function &lt;math&gt;f : \mathbb{B}^n \to \R \cup \{\infty \}&lt;/math&gt; defined on the ''n''-dimensional ball we have:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = | x |^{-\alpha} \in W^{k,p}(\mathbb{B}^n) \ \Leftrightarrow \ \alpha &lt; \tfrac{n}{p} - k.&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, the blow-up of ''f'' at 0 "counts for less" when ''n'' is large since the unit ball has "more outside and less inside" in higher dimensions.

====Absolutely continuous on lines (ACL) characterization of Sobolev functions====
Let {{math|1 ≤ ''p'' ≤ +∞}}.  If a function is in {{math|''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1,''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, then, possibly after modifying the function on a set of measure zero, the restriction to [[almost every]] line parallel to the coordinate directions in &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; is [[absolutely continuous]]; what's more, the classical derivative along the lines that are parallel to the coordinate directions are in {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω)}}.  Conversely, if the restriction of {{mvar|f}} to almost every line parallel to the coordinate directions is absolutely continuous, then the pointwise gradient {{math|∇''f''}} exists [[almost everywhere]], and {{mvar|f}} is in {{math|''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1,''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} provided {{mvar|f}} and {{math|{{!}}∇''f''&amp;thinsp;{{!}}}} are both in {{math|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω)}}.  In particular, in this case the weak partial derivatives of {{mvar|f}} and pointwise partial derivatives of {{mvar|f}} agree almost everywhere. The ACL characterization of the Sobolev spaces was established by [[Otto M. Nikodym]] ([[#CITEREFNikodym1933|1933]]); see {{harv|Maz'ya|1985|loc=§1.1.3}}.

A stronger result holds in the case {{math|''p'' &gt; ''n''}}.  A function in {{math|''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1,''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} is, after modifying on a set of measure zero, [[Hölder continuous]] of exponent {{math|''γ'' {{=}} 1 − ''n''/''p''}}, by [[Sobolev inequality#Morrey's inequality|Morrey's inequality]].  In particular, if {{math|''p'' {{=}} +∞}}, then the function is [[Lipschitz continuous]].

==== Functions vanishing at the boundary ====
{{See also|Trace operator}}

The Sobolev space ''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) is also denoted by ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω).  It is a Hilbert space, with an important subspace &lt;math&gt;H^1_0(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; defined to be the closure in ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) of the infinitely differentiable functions compactly supported in {{math|Ω}}. The Sobolev norm defined above reduces here to

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{H^1} = \left ( \int_\Omega \left ( |f|^2 + |\nabla f|^2 \right) \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

When {{math|Ω}} has a regular boundary, {{math|''H''{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}} can be described as the space of functions in  ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) that vanish at the boundary, in the sense of traces ([[Sobolev space#Extension by zero|see below]]).  When {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}}, if {{math|Ω {{=}} (''a'', ''b'')}} is a bounded interval, then {{math|''H''{{su|p=1|b=0}}(''a'', ''b'')}} consists of continuous functions on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} of the form

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \int_a^x f'(t) \, \mathrm{d}t, \qquad x \in [a, b]&lt;/math&gt;

where the generalized derivative {{math|''f′''}} is in {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''a'', ''b'')}} and has 0 integral, so that {{math|''f''&amp;thinsp;(''b'') {{=}} ''f''&amp;thinsp;(''a'') {{=}} 0}}.

When {{math|Ω}} is bounded, the [[Poincaré inequality]] states that there is a constant {{math|''C'' {{=}} ''C''(Ω)}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\Omega | f|^2 \leqslant C^2 \, \int_\Omega |\nabla f|^2, \quad f \in H^1_0(\Omega).&lt;/math&gt;

When {{math|Ω}} is bounded, the injection from {{math|''H''{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}} to {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} is [[Compact operator|compact]].  This fact plays a role in the study of the [[Dirichlet problem]], and in the fact that there exists an [[orthonormal basis]] of {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} consisting of eigenvectors of the [[Laplace operator]] (with [[Dirichlet boundary condition]]).

==Traces==
{{See also|Trace operator}}

Sobolev spaces are often considered when investigating partial differential equations. It is essential to consider boundary values of Sobolev functions. If ''u''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''C''(Ω), those boundary values are described by the restriction &lt;math&gt;u|_{\partial\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;. However, it is not clear how to describe values at the boundary for ''u''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W&lt;sup&gt;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω), as the ''n''-dimensional measure of the boundary is zero. The following theorem&lt;ref name="Adams1975" /&gt; resolves the problem:

:'''Trace Theorem.''' Assume Ω is bounded with [[Lipschitz boundary]]. Then there exists a bounded linear operator &lt;math&gt;T: W^{1,p}(\Omega)\to L^p(\partial\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; such that
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
Tu &amp;= u|_{\partial\Omega} &amp;&amp; u\in W^{1,p}(\Omega)\cap C(\overline{\Omega}) \\
\|Tu\|_{L^p(\partial\Omega)}&amp;\leqslant c(p,\Omega)\|u\|_{W^{1,p}(\Omega)} &amp;&amp; u\in W^{1,p}(\Omega).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

''Tu'' is called the trace of ''u''. Roughly speaking, this theorem extends the restriction operator to the Sobolev space ''W''&lt;sup&gt;1,''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) for well-behaved Ω. Note that the [[trace operator]] ''T'' is in general not surjective, but for 1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞ it maps onto the Sobolev-Slobodeckij space &lt;math&gt;W^{1-\frac{1}{p},p}(\partial\Omega).&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, taking the trace costs 1/''p'' of a derivative. The functions ''u'' in ''W''&lt;sup&gt;1,p&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) with zero trace, i.e. ''Tu''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, can be characterized by the equality

:&lt;math&gt; W_0^{1,p}(\Omega)= \left \{u\in W^{1,p}(\Omega): Tu=0 \right \},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; W_0^{1,p}(\Omega):= \left \{u\in W^{1,p}(\Omega): \exists \{u_m\}_{m=1}^\infty\subset C_c^\infty(\Omega), \ \text{such that} \ u_m\to u \ \textrm{in} \ W^{1,p}(\Omega) \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, for Ω bounded with Lipschitz boundary, trace-zero functions in ''W''&lt;sup&gt;1,''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) can be approximated by smooth functions with compact support.

==Sobolev spaces with non-integer ''k''==

===Bessel potential spaces===
For a natural number ''k'' and {{math|1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞}} one can show (by using [[Multiplier (Fourier analysis)|Fourier multipliers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bergh|Löfström|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Triebel1995"&gt;{{harvnb|Triebel|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that the space &lt;math&gt;W^{k, p}(\R^n)&lt;/math&gt; can equivalently be defined as

:&lt;math&gt; W^{k,p}(\mathbb{R}^n) = H^{k,p}(\mathbb{R}^n) := \left \{f \in L^p(\mathbb{R}^n) : \mathcal{F}^{-1} \left [(1+ |\xi|^2)^{\frac{k}{2}}\mathcal{F}f \right ] \in L^p(\mathbb{R}^n) \right \} &lt;/math&gt;

with the norm

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{H^{k,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)} := \left \|\mathcal{F}^{-1} \left [\left (1+ |\xi|^2 \right )^{\frac{k}{2}}\mathcal{F}f \right ]  \right \|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)} &lt;/math&gt;.

This motivates Sobolev spaces with non-integer order since in the above definition we can replace ''k'' by any real number ''s''. The resulting spaces

:&lt;math&gt; H^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^n) := \left \{f \in L^p(\mathbb{R}^n) : \mathcal{F}^{-1} \left [\left (1+ |\xi|^2 \right )^{\frac{s}{2}}\mathcal{F}f \right ] \in L^p(\mathbb{R}^n) \right \} &lt;/math&gt;

are called Bessel potential spaces&lt;ref&gt;Bessel potential spaces with variable integrability have been independently introduced by Almeida &amp; Samko (A. Almeida and S. Samko, "Characterization of [[Riesz potential|Riesz]] and [[Bessel potential]]s on variable [[Lp space|Lebesgue space]]s", J. Function Spaces Appl. 4 (2006), no. 2, 113–144) and Gurka, Harjulehto &amp; Nekvinda (P. Gurka, P. Harjulehto and A. Nekvinda: "Bessel potential spaces with variable exponent", Math. Inequal. Appl. 10 (2007), no. 3, 661–676).&lt;/ref&gt; (named after [[Friedrich Bessel]]). They are Banach spaces in general and Hilbert spaces in the special case ''p'' = 2.

&lt;math&gt;H^{s,p}(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of restrictions of functions from &lt;math&gt;H^{s,p}(\R^n)&lt;/math&gt; to Ω equipped with the norm

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{H^{s,p}(\Omega)} := \inf \left \{\|g\|_{H^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)} : g \in H^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^n), g|_{\Omega} = f \right \} &lt;/math&gt;.

Again, ''H&lt;sup&gt;s,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω) is a Banach space and in the case ''p'' = 2 a Hilbert space.

Using extension theorems for Sobolev spaces, it can be shown that also ''W&lt;sup&gt;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω) = ''H&lt;sup&gt;k,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω) holds in the sense of equivalent norms, if Ω is domain with uniform ''C&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''-boundary, ''k'' a natural number and {{math|1 &lt; p &lt; ∞}}. By the [[embedding]]s

:&lt;math&gt; H^{k+1,p}(\mathbb{R}^n) \hookrightarrow H^{s',p}(\mathbb{R}^n) \hookrightarrow H^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^n) \hookrightarrow H^{k, p}(\mathbb{R}^n), \quad k \leqslant s \leqslant s' \leqslant k+1 &lt;/math&gt;

the Bessel potential spaces &lt;math&gt;H^{s,p}(\R^n)&lt;/math&gt; form a continuous scale between the Sobolev spaces &lt;math&gt;W^{k,p}(\R^n).&lt;/math&gt; From an abstract point of view, the Bessel potential spaces occur as complex [[interpolation space]]s of Sobolev spaces, i.e. in the sense of equivalent norms it holds that

:&lt;math&gt; \left [ W^{k,p}(\mathbb{R}^n), W^{k+1,p}(\mathbb{R}^n) \right ]_\theta = H^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^n),&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;1 \leqslant p \leqslant \infty, \ 0 &lt; \theta &lt; 1, \ s= (1-\theta)k + \theta (k+1)= k+\theta. &lt;/math&gt;

===Sobolev–Slobodeckij spaces===

Another approach to define fractional order Sobolev spaces arises from the idea to generalize the [[Hölder condition]] to the ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lunardi|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; For &lt;math&gt;1 \leqslant p &lt; \infty, \theta \in (0, 1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f \in L^p(\Omega),&lt;/math&gt; the '''Slobodeckij seminorm''' (roughly analogous to the Hölder seminorm) is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; [f]_{\theta, p, \Omega} :=\left(\int_{\Omega} \int_{\Omega} \frac{|f(x)-f(y)|^p}{|x-y|^{\theta p + n}} \; dx \; dy\right)^{\frac{1}{p}} &lt;/math&gt;.

Let {{math|s &gt; 0}} be not an integer and set &lt;math&gt;\theta = s - \lfloor s \rfloor \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt;. Using the same idea as for the [[Holder space#H.C3.B6lder spaces|Hölder spaces]], the '''Sobolev–Slobodeckij space'''&lt;ref&gt;In the literature, fractional Sobolev-type spaces are also called ''Aronszajn spaces'', ''Gagliardo spaces'' or ''Slobodeckij spaces'', after the names of the mathematicians who introduced them in the 1950s:  [[Nachman Aronszajn|N. Aronszajn]] ("Boundary values of functions with finite [[Dirichlet integral]]", Techn. Report of Univ. of Kansas 14 (1955), 77–94), E. Gagliardo ("Proprietà di alcune classi di funzioni in più variabili", ''Ricerche Mat.'' 7 (1958), 102–137), and L. N. Slobodeckij ("Generalized Sobolev spaces and their applications to boundary value problems of partial differential equations", Leningrad. ''Gos. Ped. Inst. Učep. Zap.'' 197 (1958), 54–112).&lt;/ref&gt; ''W&lt;sup&gt;s,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω) is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; W^{s,p}(\Omega) := \left\{f \in W^{\lfloor s \rfloor, p}(\Omega) : \sup_{|\alpha| = \lfloor s \rfloor} [D^\alpha f]_{\theta, p, \Omega} &lt; \infty \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is a Banach space for the norm

:&lt;math&gt; \|f \| _{W^{s, p}(\Omega)} := \|f\|_{W^{\lfloor s \rfloor,p}(\Omega)} + \sup_{|\alpha| = \lfloor s \rfloor} [D^\alpha f]_{\theta, p, \Omega}.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is suitably regular in the sense that there exist certain extension operators, then also the Sobolev–Slobodeckij spaces form a scale of Banach spaces, i.e. one has the continuous injections or [[embedding]]s

:&lt;math&gt; W^{k+1,p}(\Omega) \hookrightarrow W^{s',p}(\Omega) \hookrightarrow W^{s,p}(\Omega) \hookrightarrow W^{k, p}(\Omega), \quad k \leqslant s \leqslant s' \leqslant k+1.&lt;/math&gt;

There are examples of irregular Ω such that ''W''&lt;sup&gt;1,''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) is not even a vector subspace of ''W&lt;sup&gt;s,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω) for 0 &lt; ''s'' &lt; 1.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}((Check Example 9.1 in the Hitchhiker guide.))

From an abstract point of view, the spaces ''W&lt;sup&gt;s,p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω) coincide with the real [[interpolation space]]s of Sobolev spaces, i.e. in the sense of equivalent norms the following holds:

:&lt;math&gt; W^{s,p}(\Omega) = \left (W^{k,p}(\Omega), W^{k+1,p}(\Omega) \right)_{\theta, p} , \quad k \in \mathbb{N}, s \in (k, k+1), \theta = s - \lfloor s \rfloor &lt;/math&gt;.

Sobolev–Slobodeckij spaces play an important role in the study of traces of Sobolev functions. They are special cases of [[Besov space]]s.&lt;ref name="Triebel1995" /&gt;

== Extension operators ==

If &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] whose boundary is not too poorly behaved (e.g., if its boundary is a manifold, or satisfies the more permissive "[[cone condition]]") then there is an operator ''A'' mapping functions of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; to functions of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; such that:

# ''Au''(''x'') = ''u''(''x'') for almost every ''x'' in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and
# &lt;math&gt;A : W^{k,p}(\Omega) \to W^{k,p}({\mathbb R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous for any 1 ≤ ''p'' ≤ ∞ and integer ''k''.

We will call such an operator ''A'' an extension operator for &lt;math&gt;\Omega.&lt;/math&gt;

===Case of ''p'' = 2===

Extension operators are the most natural way to define &lt;math&gt;H^s(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; for non-integer ''s'' (we cannot work directly on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; since taking Fourier transform is a global operation). We define &lt;math&gt;H^s(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; by saying that &lt;math&gt; u \in H^s(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;Au \in H^s(\mathbb R^n).&lt;/math&gt; Equivalently, complex interpolation yields the same &lt;math&gt;H^s(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; spaces so long as &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; has an extension operator. If &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; does not have an extension operator, complex interpolation is the only way to obtain the &lt;math&gt;H^s(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; spaces.

As a result, the interpolation inequality still holds.

=== Extension by zero ===

Like [[#Functions vanishing at the boundary|above]], we define &lt;math&gt;H^s_0(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; to be the closure in &lt;math&gt;H^s(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; of the space &lt;math&gt;C^\infty_c(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; of infinitely differentiable compactly supported functions. Given the definition of a trace, above, we may state the following

:'''Theorem.''' Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be uniformly ''C&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' regular, ''m'' ≥ ''s'' and let ''P'' be the linear map sending ''u'' in &lt;math&gt;H^s(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; to
::&lt;math&gt;\left.\left(u,\frac{du}{dn}, \dots, \frac{d^k u}{dn^k}\right)\right|_G&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''d/dn'' is the derivative normal to ''G'', and ''k'' is the largest integer less than ''s''. Then &lt;math&gt;H^s_0&lt;/math&gt; is precisely the kernel of ''P''.

If &lt;math&gt;u\in H^s_0(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; we may define its '''extension by zero''' &lt;math&gt;\tilde u \in L^2({\mathbb R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; in the natural way, namely

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde u(x)= \begin{cases} u(x) &amp; x \in \Omega \\ 0 &amp; \text{else} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

:'''Theorem.''' Let &lt;math&gt;s &gt; \tfrac{1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt; The map &lt;math&gt;u \mapsto \tilde u&lt;/math&gt; is continuous into &lt;math&gt;H^s({\mathbb R}^n)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''s'' is not of the form &lt;math&gt;n + \tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; for ''n'' an integer.

For ''f''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω) its extension by zero,

:&lt;math&gt;Ef := \begin{cases} f &amp; \textrm{on} \ \Omega, \\ 0 &amp; \textrm{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

is an element of &lt;math&gt;L^p(\R^n).&lt;/math&gt; Furthermore,

:&lt;math&gt; \| Ef \|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)}= \| f \|_{L^p(\Omega)}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of the Sobolev space ''W''&lt;sup&gt;1,p&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) for 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;p&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;∞, extending a function ''u'' by zero will not necessarily yield an element of &lt;math&gt;W^{1,p}(\R^n).&lt;/math&gt; But if Ω is bounded with Lipschitz boundary (e.g. ∂Ω is C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''), then for any bounded open set O such that Ω⊂⊂O (i.e. Ω is compactly contained in O), there exists a bounded linear operator&lt;ref name="Adams1975" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E: W^{1,p}(\Omega)\to W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^n),&lt;/math&gt;

such that for each ''u''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''W''&lt;sup&gt;1,p&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω): ''Eu''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''u'' a.e. on Ω, ''Eu'' has compact support within O, and there exists a constant ''C'' depending only on p, Ω, O and the dimension ''n'', such that
:&lt;math&gt;\| Eu \|_{W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^n)}\leqslant C \|u\|_{W^{1,p}(\Omega)}.&lt;/math&gt;
We call ''Eu'' an extension of ''u'' to &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt;

==Sobolev embeddings==
{{Main|Sobolev inequality}}

It is a natural question to ask if a Sobolev function is continuous or even continuously differentiable. Roughly speaking, sufficiently many weak derivatives or large ''p'' result in a classical derivative. This idea is generalized and made precise in the [[Sobolev inequality|Sobolev embedding theorem]].

Write &lt;math&gt;W^{k,p}&lt;/math&gt; for the Sobolev space of some compact Riemannian manifold of dimension ''n''. Here ''k'' can be any real number, and 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;∞. (For ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞ the Sobolev space &lt;math&gt;W^{k,\infty}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the [[Hölder space]] ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''n'',α&lt;/sup&gt; where ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;α and 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;α&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1.) The Sobolev embedding theorem states that if &lt;math&gt;k \geqslant m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k - \tfrac{n}{p} \geqslant m - \tfrac{n}{q}&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;W^{k,p}\subseteq W^{m,q}&lt;/math&gt;

and the embedding is continuous. Moreover, if &lt;math&gt;k &gt; m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k - \tfrac{n}{p} &gt; m - \tfrac{n}{q}&lt;/math&gt; then the embedding is completely continuous (this is sometimes called '''Kondrachov's theorem''' or the '''Rellich-Kondrachov theorem'''). Functions in &lt;math&gt;W^{m,\infty}&lt;/math&gt; have all derivatives of order less than ''m'' continuous, so in particular this gives conditions on Sobolev spaces for various derivatives to be continuous. Informally these embeddings say that to convert an ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; estimate to a boundedness estimate costs 1/''p'' derivatives per dimension.

There are similar variations of the embedding theorem for non-compact manifolds such as &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; {{harv|Stein|1970}}. Sobolev embeddings on &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; that are not compact often have a related, but weaker,  property of [[Cocompact embedding|cocompactness]].

'''Surprisal analysis''' is an [[information theory|information-theoretical]] analysis technique that integrates and applies principles of [[thermodynamics]] and maximal [[entropy]]. Surprisal analysis is capable of relating the underlying microscopic properties to the macroscopic bulk properties of a system. It has already been applied to a spectrum of disciplines including engineering, [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biomedical engineering]]. Recently, it has been extended to characterize the state of living cells, specifically monitoring and characterizing biological processes in real time using [[DNA transcription|transcriptional]] data.

==History==
Surprisal analysis was formulated at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] as a joint effort between [[Raphael David Levine]], [[Richard Barry Bernstein]] and Avinoam Ben-Shaul in 1972.  Levine and colleagues had recognized a need to better understand the dynamics of [[list of types of equilibrium|non-equilibrium systems]], particularly of small systems, that are not seemingly applicable to thermodynamic reasoning.&lt;ref name="Levine2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine |first=Raphael D. |title=Molecular Reaction Dynamics |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FVqyS31OM7sC&amp;dq=&amp;lr=&amp;hl=en |isbn=9780521842761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alhassid and Levine first applied surprisal analysis in nuclear physics, to characterize the distribution of products in heavy ion reactions. Since its formulation, surprisal analysis has become a critical tool for the analysis of reaction dynamics and is an official [[IUPAC]] term.&lt;ref name="Levine1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agmon |first1=N |last2=Alhassid |first2=Y |last3=Levine |first3=RD |title=An algorithm for finding the distribution of maximal entropy |journal=Journal of Computational Physics |volume=30 |issue=2|pages=250–258 |year=1979 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/0021-9991(79)90102-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;*

==Application==
Maximum [[entropy]] methods are at the core of a new view of scientific inference, allowing analysis and interpretation of large and sometimes noisy data. Surprisal analysis extends principles of maximal entropy and of [[thermodynamics]], where both [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] thermodynamics and [[statistical mechanics]] are assumed to be inferences processes.  This enables surprisal analysis to be an effective method of information quantification and compaction and of providing an unbiased characterization of systems. Surprisal analysis is particularly useful to characterize and understand dynamics in small systems, where energy fluxes otherwise negligible in large systems, heavily influence system behavior.

Foremost, surprisal analysis identifies the state of a system when it reaches its maximal entropy, or [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].  This is known as balance state of the system because once a system reaches its maximal entropy, it can no longer initiate or participate in spontaneous processes.  Following the determination of the balanced state, surprisal analysis then characterizes all the states in which the system deviates away from the balance state. These deviations are caused by constraints; these constraints on the system prevent the system from reaching its maximal entropy. Surprisal analysis is applied to both identify and characterize these constraints. In terms of the constraints, the probability &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; of an event &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is quantified by

:&lt;math&gt;P(n)=P^0(n)\exp\left[-\sum_{\alpha}\lambda_{\alpha}G_{\alpha}(n)\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

Here &lt;math&gt;P^0(n)&lt;/math&gt;  is the probability of the event &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in the balanced state. It is usually called the “prior probability” because it is the probability of an event &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; prior to any constraints. The surprisal itself is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\text{surprisal}&amp;\stackrel{\text{def}}{=} -\ln \frac{P(n)}{P^0(n)} \\ &amp;= \sum_{\alpha}\lambda_{\alpha}G_{\alpha}(n) \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The surprisal equals the sum over the constraints and is a measure of the deviation from the balanced state. These deviations are ranked on the degree of deviation from the balance state and ordered on the most to least influential to the system.  This ranking is provided through the use of [[Lagrange multipliers]]. The most important constraint and usually the constraint sufficient to characterize a system exhibit the largest Lagrange multiplier. The multiplier for constraint &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is denoted above as &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;; larger multipliers identify more influential constraints.  The event variable &lt;math&gt;G_{\alpha}(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the constraint &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for the event &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers&lt;ref name="Levine1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine |first=RD |title=An information theoretical approach to inversion problems |journal=J. Phys. A |volume=13 |page=91 |year=1980 |doi=10.1088/0305-4470/13/1/011}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires that the prior probability &lt;math&gt;P^0(n)&lt;/math&gt; and the nature of the constraints be experimentally identified. A numerical algorithm for determining Lagrange multipliers has been introduced by Agmon et al.&lt;ref name="Levine1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levine |first1=RD |last2=Bernstein |first2=RB |title=Energy disposal and energy consumption in elementary chemical relations: The information theoretic approach |journal=Acc.

Res. |volume=7 |pages=393 |year=1974|doi=10.1021/ar50084a001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, [[singular value decomposition]] and [[principal component analysis]] of the surprisal was utilized to identify constraints on biological systems, extending surprisal analysis to better understanding biological dynamics as shown in the figure.

'''SPAA''', the '''ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures''', is an [[academic conference]] in the fields of [[parallel computing]] and [[distributed computing]]. It is sponsored by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] special interest groups [[ACM SIGACT|SIGACT]] and [[ACM SIGARCH|SIGARCH]], and it is organized in cooperation with the [[European Association for Theoretical Computer Science]] (EATCS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaa-conference.org/ SPAA web site].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

SPAA was first organised on 18–21 June 1989, in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;F. T. Leighton, editor: Proceedings of the First Annual ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures, 1989, ACM Press. {{ISBN|0-89791-323-X}}. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=72935]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989–2002, SPAA was known as '''Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures'''. In 2003, the name changed to ''Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures'' to reflect the extended scope of the conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~spaa/2003/ SPAA 2003 web site].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 and 2007, SPAA was part of the [[Federated Computing Research Conference]] (FCRC), and in 1998, 2005, and 2009, SPAA was co-located with the ACM [[Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing]] (PODC).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3804">A '''synthetic measure''' (or '''synthetic indicator''') is a [[Value (mathematics)|value]] that is the result of combining other [[System of measurement|metric]]s, which are measurements of various features.

== Examples ==
=== Quality of service ===
There is a method to measure quality of service in [[hotel]]s. In related study &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ban |first1=Olimpia |date=2008 |title=Synthetic Measure of the Quality of Service Taking into Account the Client’s Perspective in the Hotel Industry |url=http://riviste.paviauniversitypress.it/index.php/ea/article/view/1326 |journal=Economia Aziendale Online |volume=1|issue= |pages=1–7 |doi=10.13132/2038-5498/2008.1.1-7 |access-date=2018-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; authors aggregate tourist opinions, measured on a scale from 1 to 10. Synthetic measure (indicator) of service quality in each hotel is calculated with the help of the aggregation operator.

=== Project performance ===
Other study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Certa |first1=Antonella |last2=Enea |first2=Mario |last3=Giallanza |first3=Antonio |date=2009-12-04 |title=A Synthetic Measure for the Assessment of the Project Performance |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04800-5_11 |journal=Business Performance Measurement and Management |volume=|issue= |pages=167–180 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-04800-5_11 |access-date=2018-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed to use classical parameters EV, PV and AC to carry out the synthetic measure of project performance.

=== Rankings of countries ===
Different normalized stimulants and destimulants were used in research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Balcerzak |first1=Adam P. |date=2009-12-04 |title=Europe 2020 strategy and structural diversity between old and new member states. application of zero unitarization method for dynamic analysis in the years |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1717432597 |journal=Economics &amp; Sociology |volume=8|issue=2 |pages= |doi=10.14254/2071-789X.2015/8-2/14 |access-date=2018-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to create synthetic measure that selects countries with the best and the worst levels of implementation of [[Europe 2020]] targets.

=== Information quality ===
There are scientific works &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewoniewski |first1=Włodzimierz |last2=Węcel |first2=Krzysztof |date=2017-10-18 |title=Relative Quality Assessment of Wikipedia Articles in Different Languages Using Synthetic Measure |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-69023-0_24 |journal=Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing |volume=303 |issue= |pages=282–292 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-69023-0_24 |access-date=2018-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewoniewski |first1=Włodzimierz |last2=Węcel |first2=Krzysztof |last3=Abramowicz |first3=Witold |date=2017-12-08 |title=Relative Quality and Popularity Evaluation of Multilingual Wikipedia Articles |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2227-9709/4/4/43 |journal=Informatics |volume=4|issue=4 |pages= |doi=10.3390/informatics4040043 |access-date=2018-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that describe method of quality assessment of [[Wikipedia]] articles using synthetic measure. The quality can be measured on a scale between 0 and 100 based on the following formula:

: &lt;math&gt;\text{quality score} =\frac{1}{c} \sum_{i=1}^cnm_i&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;nm_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is a normalized metric &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the number of metrics

The results of the calculations are available on [[WikiRank]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://wikirank.net WikiRank] - quality and popularity assessment of Wikipedia articles&lt;/ref&gt; service.

In [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and theoretical [[computer graphics]], '''tapering''' is a kind of shape deformation.&lt;ref name=Shirley2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shirley|first1=Peter|last2=Ashikhmin|first2=Michael|last3=Marschner|first3=Steve|author1link=Peter Shirley|title=Fundamentals of Computer Graphics|date=2009|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781568814698|page=426|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barr1984&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barr|first1=Alan H.|title=GLOBAL AND LOCAL DEFORMATIONS OF SOLID PRIMITIVES|journal=Computer Graphics|date=July 1984|volume=18|issue=3|pages=21-30|url=https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~david/Classes/CS586/Papers/p21-barr.pdf|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as an affine transformation, such as scaling or shearing, is a first-order model of shape deformation, there also exist higher-order deformations such as tapering, twisting, and bending. Tapering can be thought of as non-constant [[Scaling (geometry)|scaling]] by a given tapering function. The resultant deformations can be linear or nonlinear.

To create a nonlinear taper, instead of scaling in ''x'' and ''y'' for all ''z'' with constants as in:

: &lt;math&gt;q= \begin{bmatrix}
a &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; b &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} p,&lt;/math&gt;

let ''a'' and ''b'' be functions of ''z'' so that:

: &lt;math&gt;q= \begin{bmatrix}
a(p_z) &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; b(p_z) &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix} p.&lt;/math&gt;

An example of a linear taper is &lt;math&gt;a(z) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1z&lt;/math&gt;, and a quadratic taper &lt;math&gt;a(z) = {\alpha}_0 + {\alpha}_1z + {\alpha}_2z^2&lt;/math&gt;.

As another example, if the parametric equation of a cube were given by ''&amp;fnof;''(''t'') =&amp;nbsp;(''x''(''t''),&amp;nbsp;''y''(''t''),&amp;nbsp;''z''(''t'')), a nonlinear taper could be applied so that the cube's volume slowly decreases (or tapers) as the function moves in the positive ''z'' direction. For the given cube, an example of a nonlinear taper along ''z'' would be if, for instance, the function ''T''(''z'') =&amp;nbsp;1/(''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''bt'') were applied to the cube's equation such that ''&amp;fnof;''(''t'') =&amp;nbsp;(''T''(''z'')''x''(''t''),&amp;nbsp;''T''(''z'')''y''(''t''),&amp;nbsp;''T''(''z'')''z''(''t'')), for some real constants ''a'' and&amp;nbsp;''b''.
