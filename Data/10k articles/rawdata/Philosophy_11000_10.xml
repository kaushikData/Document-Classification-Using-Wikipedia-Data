'''Albert of Saxony''' ([[Latin]]: ''Albertus de Saxonia''; c. 1320 – 8 July 1390) was a [[German people|German]] [[philosopher]] known for his contributions to [[logic]] and [[physics]]. He was [[bishop of Halberstadt]] from 1366 until his death.

==Life==
Albert was born at [[Rickensdorf]] near [[Helmstedt]], the son of a farmer in a small village; but because of his talent, he was sent to study at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]] and the [[University of Paris]].

At Paris, he became a master of arts (a professor), and held this post from 1351 until 1362. He also studied theology at the [[College of Sorbonne]], although without receiving a degree. In 1353, he was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the University of Paris. After 1362, Albert went to the court of [[Pope Urban V]] in [[Avignon]] as an envoy of [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]], in order to negotiate the founding of the [[University of Vienna]]. The negotiations were successful, and Albert became the first rector of this University in 1365.

In 1366, Albert was elected [[bishop of Halberstadt]] (counted as '''Albert III'''), Halberstadt being the diocese in which he was born. As Bishop of Halberstadt, he allied himself with [[Magnus with the Necklace, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], against [[Gebhard of Berg]], [[Bishop of Hildesheim]], and was taken prisoner by Gebhard in the [[battle of Dinckler]] in 1367.

He died at [[Halberstadt]] in 1390.

==Philosophy==
Albert was a pupil of [[Jean Buridan]]&lt;ref name="Clagett 522"/&gt; and was very much influenced by Buridan's teachings on [[physics]] and [[logic]]. As a natural philosopher, he contributed to the spread of Parisian [[natural philosophy]] throughout [[Italy]] and central Europe. Similar to Buridan, Albert combined [[critical analysis]] of [[language]] with epistemological [[pragmatism]]. Albert distinguishes, as his teacher did, between what is absolutely impossible or contradictory and what is impossible “in the common course of nature” and considers hypotheses under circumstances that are not naturally possible but imaginable given God’s absolute power. Albert refused to extend the [[reference]] of a [[Physical body|physical]] [[Terminology|term]] to [[supernatural]], purely [[Object of the mind|imaginary]] possibilities.  Later regarded as one of the principal adherents of [[nominalism]], along with his near contemporaries at Paris, namely Buridan and [[Marsilius of Inghen]], whose works are often so similar as to be confused with each other. The subsequent wide circulation of Albert’s work made him a better-known figure in some areas than more important contemporaries like Buridan and [[Nicole Oresme]].

Albert's work in [[logic]] also shows strong influence by [[William of Ockham]], whose commentaries on the ''logica vetus'' (i.&amp;nbsp;e. on [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], and [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Categoriae]]'' and ''[[De interpretatione]]'') were made the subject of a series of works called ''Quaestiones'' by Albert.

[[File:Theory of impetus.svg|thumb|Three stage [[theory of impetus]] according to Albert von Sachsen]]

Albert of Saxony's teachings on logic and metaphysics were extremely influential. The [[theory of impetus]] introduced a third stage to the two stage theory of [[Avicenna]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael McCloskey: ''Impetustheorie und Intuition in der Physik.''. In: ''Newtons Universum''. Verlag Spektrum der Wissenschaft: Heidelberg 1990, {{ISBN|3-89330-750-8}}, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Initial stage. Motion is in a straight line in direction of impetus which is dominant while gravity is insignificant
# Intermediate stage. Path begins to deviate downwards from straight line as part of a great circle as air resistance slows projectile and gravity recovers.
# Last stage. Gravity alone draws projectile downwards vertically as all impetus is spent.

This theory was a precursor to the modern theory of [[inertia]].

Although Buridan remained the predominant figure in logic, Albert's ''Perutilis logica'' (c. 1360) was destined to serve as a popular text because of its systematic nature and also because it takes up and develops essential aspects of the Ockhamist position. Albert accepted Ockham’s conception of the nature of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]]. Albert believed that [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] rests on a referential relation of the sign to the individual thing, and that the spoken sign depends for its signification on the conceptual sign. Albert followed Ockham in his conception of [[universals]] and in his theory of [[supposition]].  Specifically, Albert preserved Ockham’s notion of simple supposition, understood as the direct reference of a term to the concept on which it depends when it signifies an extra-mental thing. Albert followed Ockham in his theory of [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]] and contrary to Buridan, refused to treat quantity as a feature of reality in its own right, but rather reduced it to a disposition of [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]]. Albert established signification through a referential relation to a singular thing defining the relation of the spoken to conceptual signs as a relation of subordination.  Albert’s treatment of relation was highly original.  Although, like Ockham, he refused to construe relations as things distinct from [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] entities, he clearly ascribed them to an act of the [[soul]] by which absolute entities are compared and placed in relation to each other.  He therefore completely rejected certain propositions Ockham had admitted reasonable, even if he did not construe them in the same way.

Albert’s voluminous collection of ''Sophismata'' (c. 1359) examined various sentences that raise difficulties of interpretation due to the presence of [[syncategorematic term]]s such as [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] and certain [[prepositions]], which, according to medieval logicians, do not have a proper and determinate signification but rather modify the signification of the other terms in the [[proposition]]s in which they occur.  In his ''Sophismata,'' he followed [[William Heytesbury]].  In his analysis of [[Epistemic modality|epistemic]] verbs or of [[infinity]], Albert admitted that a proposition has its own signification, which is not that of its [[Terminology|terms]]: just like a syncategorematic term, a proposition signifies a “mode of a thing.”  Albert made use of the idea of the distinguishable signification of the proposition in defining [[truth]] and in dealing with “[[insolubles]]” or [[paradox]]es of [[self-reference]].  In this work he shows that since every proposition, by its very form, signifies that it is true, an insoluble proposition will turn out to be false because it will signify at once both that it is true and that it is false.

Albert also authored commentaries on ''Ars Vetus'', a set of twenty-five ''Quaestiones logicales'' (c. 1356) that involved semantical problems and the status of logic, and ''Quaestiones'' on the ''Posterior Analytics''. Albert explored in a series of disputed [[question]]s the status of [[logic]] and [[semantics]], as well as the [[theory of reference]] and [[theory of truth|truth]].  Albert was influenced by English logicians and was influential in the diffusion of [[Terminism#Philosophical terminism|terminist]] logic in central Europe.  Albert is considered a major contributor in his theory of consequences, found in his ''Perutilis Logica''. Albert took a major step forward in the medieval theory of [[logical deduction]].

But it was his commentary on [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' that was especially widely read. Many manuscripts of it can be found in France and Italy, in Erfurt and Prague. Albert's ''Physics'' basically guaranteed the transmission of the Parisian tradition to Italy, where it was authoritative along with the works of [[William Heytesbury|Heytesbury]] and [[John Dumbleton]]. His commentary on Aristotle's ''[[De caelo]]'' was also influential, eventually eclipsing Buridan's commentary on this text. [[Blasius of Parma]] read it in Bologna between 1379 and 1382. A little later, it enjoyed a wide audience at Vienna. His ''Treatise on Proportions'' was often quoted in Italy where, in addition to the texts of [[Thomas Bradwardine]] and [[Oresme]], it influenced the application of the theory of [[Ratio|proportions]] to [[Motion (physics)|motion]].

Albert’s commentaries on the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and the ''[[Economics (Aristotle)|Economics]]'' also survive (both unedited), as well as several short [[mathematical]] texts, most notably ''Tractatus proportionum'' (c. 1353). Although Albert studied [[theology]] in Paris, no theological writing survived.

Albert played an essential role in the diffusion throughout Italy and central Europe of Parisian ideas which bore the mark of Buridan's teachings, but which were also clearly shaped by Albert's own grasp of English innovations. At the same time, Albert was not merely a compiler of the work of others. He knew how to construct proofs of undeniable originality on many topics in logic and physics.

'''Andrzej Mostowski''' (1 November 1913 – 22 August 1975) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[mathematician]]. He is perhaps best remembered for the [[Mostowski collapse lemma]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Lviv|Lemberg]], [[Austria-Hungary]], Mostowski entered [[University of Warsaw]] in 1931. He was influenced by [[Kazimierz Kuratowski|Kuratowski]], [[Adolf Lindenbaum|Lindenbaum]], and [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]. His Ph.D. came in 1939, officially directed by [[Kazimierz Kuratowski|Kuratowski]] but in practice directed by [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]] who was a young lecturer at that time.

He became an accountant after the German [[invasion of Poland]] but continued working in the [[Underground education in Poland during World War II|Underground Warsaw University]]. After the [[Warsaw uprising]] of 1944, the [[Nazis]] tried to put him in a concentration camp. With the help of some Polish nurses, he escaped to a hospital, choosing to take bread with him rather than his notebook containing his research. Some of this research he reconstructed after the War, however much of it remained lost.

His work was largely on [[recursion theory]] and [[Undecidable problem|undecidability]]. From 1946 until his death in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], he worked at the [[University of Warsaw]]. Much of his work, during that time, was on first order [[logic]] and [[model theory]].

His son [[Tadeusz Mostowski|Tadeusz]] is also a mathematician working on [[differential geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/wydzial/organizacja/pracownicy/tadeusz.mostowski.xml?LANG%3Den%26para%3D%26parb%3D |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613111648/http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/wydzial/organizacja/pracownicy/tadeusz.mostowski.xml?LANG=en&amp;para=&amp;parb= |archivedate=2011-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Krzysztof Kurdyka]] and [[Adam Parusinski]], Tadeusz Mostowski solved [[René Thom]]'s [[gradient conjecture]] in 2000.

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar &lt;!--|God--&gt;}}

The '''argument from miracles''' is an argument for the [[Existence of God|existence of]] [[God]] &lt;!--and/or gods?--&gt; that relies on the belief that events [[Eyewitness testimony|witnessed and described]] as [[miracle]]s –&amp;nbsp;i.e. as events not explicable by natural or scientific laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/miracle?q=miracle Miracle] at oxforddictionaries.com.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– indicate the intervention of the [[supernatural]].

One example of this argument is the [[Christological argument]]: the claim that historical evidence proves that [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus Christ rose from the dead]] and that this can only be explained if God exists. Another is the claim that many of the [[Qur'an]]'s [[Prophecy|prophecies]] have been fulfilled and that this too can only be explained if God ([[Allah]]) exists.

Defenders of the argument include [[C. S. Lewis]], [[G. K. Chesterton]] and [[William of Ockham]].

== Criticisms ==

One counter-argument to the argument from miracles is the [[argument from inconsistent revelations]], which states that multiple incompatible miracles are alleged to have occurred which provide evidence for different religions. Not all these can be correct.

Another counter-argument is [[Occam's razor]], which can be used to argue that God is unnecessary to explain miracles for which natural explanations can be found. In his documentary ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]'', British evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] utilises this argument when examining the supposed miracles in [[Lourdes]], France. According to [[Catholic theology]], supernatural cures occur in the area, but Dawkins expresses doubts as to their divine nature, noting that all the recorded cures comprise diseases which may have healed by themselves without the need for divine intervention.

Modern theologians rely on the arguments by [[David Hume]], an eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher, who is  known today for his skepticism and naturalism. Before making any claims, Hume explains the principle of evidence: the only way that we can assess the credibility of two claims is by weighing evidence. According to him, because evidence for miracles is always limited, we do not have a reason to believe in them.

'''Bak Jega''' ({{Korean|hangul=박제가|hanja=朴齊家}}; 1750&amp;ndash;1815) was a scholar of school of [[Silhak|Practical learning (Silhak)]] in the late [[Joseon Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elites and political power in South Korea |author=Pyŏng-man An |page=43 |year=2003 |publisher=[[Edward Elgar Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-84064-971-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a student of [[Bak Jiwon (born 1737)|Park Ji-won]].

==Background==
Bak Jega was a famous Silhak scholar in the late Joseon Dynasty. He was a student of another famous Silhak scholar, Park Ji Won. Bak Jega was born in 1750 and died in 1815. Bak Jega went to Qing (also referred to as "Ching"), which was the name of China at that time, after becoming a student of Park Ji Won. He learned about China’s modern culture, advanced techniques, and its economic system while there. After returning from Qing, Park Ji Won worked in [[Jiphyeonjeon]], a place where important scholars and scientists worked, during the time of King [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]].

==Legacy==
Because the Joseon government supported ‘Yuhak', a neo-Confucianist conservative ideology, Bak Jega had an important role and his desire was to make [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] rich in science and commerce.

He authored several books; the compilation is titled, ''Jeongyungyp.'' He wrote about making the commerce system stronger in ''Umyoungnomchogo'' and ''Gunyeonjib''. At that time, it was quite shocking to believe in [[Silhak]], whose ideas opposed Yuhak.

Bak Jega developed the way of agriculture, and he also enhanced some of the farming machinery to cultivate plants.

== Bukhak theory ==
He argued that using the cart to develop local commerce and at the same time develop strong ships to actively enter foreign trade in his book, &lt;Bukhakui&gt;. He called for improving the reality and proactively embracing the culture of the Qing Dynasty. He argued for the abolition of Joseon's status system, and considered commerce and industry important. He said, " If we actively take advantage of the natural environment of Joseon, which is surrounded by the sea on three sides, and develop it into maritime trade, the national power will become strong and the livelihood of the people will be stabilized." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kyeonggi.com/?mod=news&amp;act=articleView&amp;idxno=1311617|title=[실학, 조선의 재건을 꿈꾸다] 20. 북학으로 조선을 재건하자_초정 박제가|last=경기일보|first=(Kyeonggi Daily)|date=|work=경기일보|access-date=2018-04-28|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''College for Advanced Studies in Social Theory''' ({{lang-hu|Társadalomelméleti Kollégium}}, ''TEK'') is the second oldest college of its type at the [[Corvinus University of Budapest]] as well as in [[Hungary]].

== History ==

TEK is the second oldest, still operating, college in Hungary. It was founded in 1981 by young researchers and students. Its orientation can be divided into two parts: vocational work and community life. The first is well documented, the latter is somewhat more distorted, due to the effects of [[collective memory]].
[[Image:Marx old.jpg|thumb|right|[[Karl Marx]]]]

=== 1981–present ===

TEK seceded from the first established college in Hungary, the [[Rajk László College for Advanced Studies]].
However, in the beginning - before [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] - the College's main topic was the reinterpretation of [[Marx]]'s ouvre, since liberal and alternative thinking was only possible if it was related to Marxist studies. With the fall of the iron curtain, this coercion disappeared, and since the College's main profile was its diversity and openness to new ideas, philosophies and theories, the College's profile now freely and rapidly ramified into diverse - and pioneering among the Hungarian colleges at that time - topics: [[environmentalism]], [[sustainability]], [[postmodernism]], [[anarchism]], [[postmarxism]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Buddhist economics]], [[feminism]], [[minority group|sociology of minorities]], [[queer studies]], [[postcolonialism]], [[network theory]]. The College also dealt with the topic of [[squatting]], the sociological causes of [[poverty]] and since the establishment the farmost detailed analysis of [[critical theory]]/[[Frankfurt school]] among other colleges.

== Philosophical principles ==
=== Criticism ===

TEK is providing a critical approach to the economical theories that Corvinus University has in its educational program– among others, focusing on the social inequalities [[human resources]], [[structuralism]], [[neoliberalism]], [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], [[corporatism]] inherently bares -.
TEK is also involved in highly regarded green activism, such as [[critical mass]], [[gay pride]], many [[flashmob]]s, that are held in support of promoting a livable environment. Among the members of TEK are also permanent supporters of the anti-[[g8]] anti-[[g20]] demonstrations.

=== Commune ===
The TEK started a lifestyle experiment, by establishing - again firstly - the habit of an annual [[commune (intentional community)|commune]],  in which the members apply voluntarily. These communes give the participants the opportunity to experience such a lifestyle that is hard to experience among European [[capitalist]] societies. In these communities the members share all goods, live together in one place creating a highly tied community of a few.

=== Aims ===

TEK’s main aim is a critical approach to the topics taught in Corvinus University.
TEK is more of a theoretical college, putting theoretical approaches to the questions of the society in front of bare statistical analysis, processing of data.
However members of TEK – individually - are highly involved in diverse fields of practice – e.g. organizing conferences on behalf of the homeless, many voluntary work promoting the reintegration of gypsies into the labour market, helping the educational development of those from less developed areas -.

== Vocational work ==
=== Tutorials ===

The base of the vocational work in TEK are the annual or semi-annual Tutorials. The topics of these Tutorials are given by the members of the College, which Tutorials are to be held by the tutors after compiling a schedule. The participants analyse, discuss the literature together with the tutor. As a conclusion, at the end of every tutorial, the participants are to hand in an essay of one of the topics that were discussed during the Tutorial.
The main frame for the Tutorials are based on 5 main fields: [[political economy]], economics of [[globalization]], Frankfurt School, [[green economics|green]] and [[Justice (economics)|ethical]] economics, postmodern sociology.
Every fresher has to participate in the Ground Tutorial, which provides a brief insight to the work and schedule of all five fields.

=== Related works ===

[http://fordulat.net Fordulat] (meaning “facing” or “twist”) is the official periodical of the College, dealing with many critical and however yet not mainstream, but pioneering topics.

=== Conferences ===

Among many others, [[Claus Offe]], one of the leading political sociologists and of the second generation Frankfurt School attended one of the conferences held by the College.

'''David Macey''' (5 October 1949 – 7 October 2011) was an English translator and intellectual historian of the French left. He translated around sixty books from French to English, and wrote biographical studies of [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Frantz Fanon]].&lt;ref name=GuardianObit&gt;Neil Belton, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/02/david-macey-obituary|David Macey: His historical studies of philosophers won over French readers], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RPObit&gt;Neil Belton and Peter Osborne, [http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/obituary/david-macey-1949-2011 David Macey, 1949–2011: Biographer of the French intellectual Left], ''Radical Philosophy'' 171 (Jan/Feb 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IndepObit&gt;John G.

==Life==
David Macey was born in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] and grew up in [[Houghton-le-Spring]]. His father was a miner who had been sent down the pit aged fourteen, and his mother a woman whose family had been unable to afford for her to take up a [[grammar school]] place.&lt;ref name=RPObit/&gt;&lt;ref name=IndepObit/&gt; He was educated at [[Durham Johnston Grammar School]] and went on to read French at [[University College London]],&lt;ref name=GuardianObit/&gt; where he wrote a PhD on [[Paul Nizan]].&lt;ref&gt;David Macey, ''The work of Paul Nizan: a study in the influence of a political viewpoint on literary themes and structures'', PhD thesis, University College London, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interested in trying to link [[Marxism]] and [[psychoanalysis]],&lt;ref name=GuardianObit/&gt; Macey became a prolific contributor to ''[[Radical Philosophy]]''.&lt;ref name=RPObit/&gt; From 1974 he taught part-time at [[North London Polytechnic]], [[University College London|UCL]] and [[City University London]]. In 1975 he was a founding member of the British Campaign for an Independent [[East Timor]].&lt;ref name=IndepObit/&gt; After his partner Margaret Atack took a permanent post at [[Leeds University]] in 1981, Macey left academia to become a full-time writer and translator.&lt;ref name=GuardianObit/&gt; Later, in 1995, he was appointed research associate in the French department of Leeds University; in 2010 he became special professor in translation at the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref name=IndepObit/&gt;

Macey married Margaret Atack in 1988, and they adopted three children.&lt;ref name=GuardianObit/&gt;

'''David Clement Makinson''', D.Phil, (born 27 August 1941), is an [[Australian]] mathematical [[logician]] living in [[London]], [[England]].

== Career ==
Makinson began his studies at [[University of Sydney|Sydney University]] in 1958 and was an associate of the [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] Society and [[Sydney Push]]. He is a Visiting Professor in the [[London School of Economics]], [[University of London]], and an associate member of the [[Centre de Recherche en Epistémologie Appliquée]] (CREA), [[École Polytechnique]], [[Paris]]. He has held professorial rank positions in [[King's College London]], University of London and in the [[American University of Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. From 1980 till 2001 he worked for [[UNESCO]], [[Paris]].

== Contribution ==
David Makinson is highly regarded for his work on [[belief revision]], [[Inference#Inference and uncertainty|uncertain reasoning]], and [[modal logic]]. While studying in [[Oxford University]] ([[Worcester College]]) for his [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil]] under the supervision of [[Michael Dummett]], he identified the [[preface paradox]]. In belief revision he created the [[Belief revision#The AGM postulates|AGM account of theory change]] with [[Carlos Alchourrón]] and [[Peter Gärdenfors]]. In modal logic and other [[non-classical logic]]s, he showed how to establish [[completeness (logic)|completeness]] results by adapting the method of [[maximal consistent set]]. In 1969 Makinson discovered the first simple and natural [[propositional logic]] lacking the [[Kripke semantics#Finite model property|finite model property]]. Together with [[Leon van der Torre]] he developed [[input/output logic]].

The '''deuterocanonical books''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning "belonging to the second [[Biblical canon|canon]]") are books and passages considered by the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] to be canonical books of the [[Old Testament]] but which are considered non-canonical by [[Protestant]] [[Religious denomination|denominations]]. They are seven books from the [[Septuagint]], the  standard translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] in the Hellenistic period, written during the reign of [[Ptolemy II]] (283-246 BCE) and referenced extensively in the [[New Testament]], particularly in the [[Pauline Epistles]]. With the rise of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] at the end of the [[Second Temple Period]], the Hebrew Canon was in flux, until the [[Masoretic Text]], compiled between the 7th and 10th centuries, became the authoritative text of the mainstream Rabbinic Judaism. The Masoretic Text excluded the seven deuterocanonical books and formed the basis for their exclusion in the Protestant Old Testament. The term distinguished these texts both from those that were termed [[protocanonical books]], which were the books of the Hebrew canon; and from the [[Biblical Apocrypha|apocryphal books]], which were those books of Jewish origin that were known sometimes to have been read in church as [[religious text|scripture]] but which were considered not to be canonical.

The deuterocanonical books of the Old Testament are:
* [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]]
* [[Book of Judith|Judith]]
* [[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom]] (also called the Wisdom of Solomon)
* [[Sirach]] (also called Ecclesiasticus)
* [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]], including the [[Letter of Jeremiah]] ([[Book of Jeremiah#Septuagint version|Additions to Jeremiah in the Septuagint]])&lt;ref&gt;''An Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek'', [[Henry Barclay Swete]], Cambridge University Press, 1914, Part II, Chapter III, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/swete/greekot.iv.iii.html Section 6], "Baruch and the Epistle of Jeremiah were regarded by the Church as adjuncts of Jeremiah, much in the same way as Susanna and Bel were attached to Daniel. Baruch and the Epistle occur in lists which rigorously exclude the non-canonical books; they are cited as 'Jeremiah' (Iren. v. 35. I, Tert. scorp. 8, [[Clement of Alexandria]] ''[[Paedagogus]]'' i. 10, [[Cyprian]], ''Testimonia'' ii. 6); with Lamentations they form a kind of trilogy supplementary to the prophecy."; The [http://www.bible-researcher.com/trent1.html Canon of Trent] specifies "Ieremias cum Baruch" (Jeremiah with Baruch).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[1 Maccabees]]
* [[2 Maccabees]]
* [[Additions to Esther]] ([[Vulgate]] [[Esther]] 10:4 to 16:24)&lt;ref&gt;See also [https://web.archive.org/web/20000815062938/http://www.nccbuscc.org/nab/bible/index.htm#esther Esther] in the [[New American Bible|NAB]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Additions to Daniel]]:
** [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children|Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children]] ([[Vulgate]] [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 3:24–90)
** [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]] (Vulgate Daniel 13, Septuagint prologue)
** [[Bel and the Dragon]] (Vulgate Daniel 14, Septuagint epilogue)

This 16th-century debate drew on traditions witnessing a counterpart debate in the 4th and 5th centuries; occasioned then by the awareness that the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek, which the [[Early Christianity|early church]] used as its Old Testament, included several books not recognised in the Jewish canon of the bible as it had since been defined in [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. In this debate, which had preceded the dissemination of Jerome's Vulgate version, the books in the Hebrew bible had been termed "canonical"; the additional books that were recognised by the Christian churches had been termed "ecclesiastical", and those that were considered not to be in the Bible were termed "apocryphal".&lt;ref name="Bogaert 69-92"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher= Cambridge University Press |editor1= Richard Marsden |editor2=E. Ann Matter |last=Bogaert |first=Pierre Maurice |title= New Cambridge History of the Bible; Vol II |contribution= The Latin Bible. c 600 to c. 900 |pages= 69–92 |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of the term "deuterocanonical" were adopted after the 16th century by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] to denote canonical books of the Septuagint not in the Hebrew Bible (a wider selection than that adopted by the Council of Trent), and also by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] to apply to works believed to be of Jewish origin translated in the Old Testament of the [[Ethiopic Bible]]; a wider selection still.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Cambridge University Press|editor1=James Carleton Paget |editor2=Joachim Schaper |last= Bogaert |first= Pierre Maurice |title= New Cambridge History of the Bible; Vol II |contribution=The Latin Bible |pages= 505–526 |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 16th century, most [[Protestantism|Protestant Churches]] have accepted only works in the [[Masoretic Text]] of the Hebrew Bible as canonical books of the Old Testament, and hence classify all deuterocanonical texts (of whichever definition) with the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]].

==Historical background==
{{main|Development of the Old Testament canon}}
Deuterocanonical is a term coined in 1566 by the theologian [[Sixtus of Siena]], who had converted to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] from [[Judaism]], to describe scriptural texts considered [[Biblical canon|canonical]] by the Catholic Church, but which recognition was considered "secondary". For Sixtus, this term included portions of both Old and New Testaments (Sixtus considers the final chapter of the [[Gospel of Mark]] as 'deuterocanonical'); and he also applies the term to the [[Book of Esther]] from the canon of the Hebrew Bible.  The term was then taken up by other writers to apply specifically to those books of the Old Testament which had been recognised as canonical by the Council of Trent, but which were not in the Hebrew canon&lt;ref name="isbe"&gt;[http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/C/CANON+OF+THE+OLD+TESTAMENT%2C+II/ Canon of the Old Testament, II, ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'', 1915]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canonOT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commonly cited include (1) [[Melito of Sardis]], who went ''east'', to Palestine, and recorded the canon he found being used in the synagogues, as recorded in Eusebius' ''Church History'' 4.26.13–14, (2) [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], (3) [[Council of Laodicea]], (4) [[Jerome]] residing in [[Bethlehem]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The acceptance of some of these books among [[early Christians]] was widespread, though not universal, and surviving Bibles from the early Church always include, with varying degrees of recognition, books now called ''deuterocanonical''.&lt;ref&gt;J.N. D. Kelly, ''Early Christian Doctrines'', p.53&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that their canonicity seems not to have been doubted in the Church until it was challenged by Jews after AD 100,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart G. Hall, ''Doctrine and Practice in the Early Church'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes postulating a hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]]. Regional councils in the [[Western Christianity|West]] published official canons that included these books as early as the [[Christianity in the 4th century#Defining scripture|4th]] and 5th centuries.&lt;ref name="canonOT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g., the [[Council of Carthage (397)]], the [[Council of Rome]], the [[Gelasian decree]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' states that "At Jerusalem there was a renascence, perhaps a survival, of Jewish ideas, the tendency there being distinctly unfavourable to the deuteros. St. [[Cyril of Jerusalem|Cyril]] of that see, while vindicating for the Church the right to fix the Canon, places them among the apocrypha and forbids all books to be read privately which are not read in the churches. In Antioch and Syria the attitude was more favourable. [[St. Epiphanius of Salamis|St. Epiphanius]] shows hesitation about the rank of the deuteros; he esteemed them, but they had not the same place as the Hebrew books in his regard. The historian Eusebius attests the widespread doubts in his time; he classes them as antilegomena, or disputed writings, and, like Athanasius, places them in a class intermediate between the books received by all and the apocrypha."&lt;ref name="canonOT" /&gt;

"In the Latin Church, all through the [[Middle Ages]] we find evidence of hesitation about the character of the deuterocanonicals. There is a current friendly to them, another one distinctly unfavourable to their authority and sacredness, while wavering between the two are a number of writers whose veneration for these books is tempered by some perplexity as to their exact standing, and among those we note [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]. Few are found to unequivocally acknowledge their canonicity. The prevailing attitude of Western medieval authors is substantially that of the Greek Fathers. The chief cause of this phenomenon in the West is to be sought in the influence, direct and indirect, of [[St. Jerome]]'s depreciating Prologus."&lt;ref name="canonOT" /&gt;

Meanwhile, "the protocanonical books of the Old Testament correspond with those of the Bible of the Hebrews, and the Old Testament as received by Protestants."&lt;ref name="canonOT" /&gt;

===Dead Sea scrolls===
Fragments of three deuterocanonical (''Sirach'', ''Tobit'', and ''Letter of Jeremiah'') books have been found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] found at [[Qumran]], in addition to several partial copies of ''[[Book of Enoch|I Enoch]]'' and ''[[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]]'' from the Ethiopic deuterocanon, and Psalm 151 from the Eastern Orthodox Church deuterocanon.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The large majority of Old Testament references in the [[New Testament]] are taken from the [[Koine Greek]] [[Septuagint]] (LXX) – editions of which include the deuterocanonical books, as well as [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]] – both of which are called collectively ''anagignoskomena'' (''"Readable,'' namely worthy of reading").&lt;ref&gt;Prof. [[Petros Vassiliadis]] [http://users.auth.gr/~pv/inspiration.htm defines the work thus].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2018}} No two Septuagint codices contain the same apocrypha,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=E.

Greek Psalm manuscripts from the fifth century contain three New Testament "psalms": the [[Magnificat]], the [[Benedictus (Song of Zechariah)|Benedictus]], the [[Nunc dimittis]] from Luke's birth narrative, and the conclusion of the hymn that begins with the "Gloria in Excelsis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hengel|first1=Martin|title=The Septuagint as Christian Scripture|date=2004|publisher=Baker|pages=58–59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LUmGZ0NiweAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%28Martin+Hengel,+The+Septuagint+as+Christian+Scripture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pCVYVLDvC9i0yATRz4CwAg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=wishes%20to%20be%20a%20Christian%20book&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beckwith states that manuscripts of anything like the capacity of Codex Alexandrinus were not used in the first centuries of the Christian era, and believes that the comprehensive codices of the Septuagint, which start appearing in the fourth century AD, are all of Christian origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beckwith|first1=Roger|title=The Old Testament Canon of the New Testament Church|date=1986|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, MI|page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some deuterocanonicals appear to have been written originally in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], but the original text has long been lost. Archaeological finds discovered both Psalm 151 and the [[Book of Tobit]] in Hebrew among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. The Septuagint was widely accepted and used by [[Hellenistic Judaism|Greek-speaking Jews]] in the 1st century, even in the region of [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman Judea]], and therefore naturally became the text most widely used by early Christians, who were predominantly Greek speaking.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the New Testament, Hebrews 11:35 is understood by some as referring to an event that was recorded in one of the deuterocanonical books, [[2 Maccabees]].&lt;ref name=Akin/&gt; For instance, the author of Hebrews references oral{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} tradition which spoke of an Old Testament prophet who was sawn in half in Hebrews 11:37, two verses after the 2nd Maccabees reference.

===Influence of early authors===
The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] (c. 94 AD) speaks of there being 22 books in the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]] writes in ''[[Against Apion]]'', I, 8: "We have not 10,000 books among us, disagreeing with and contradicting one another, but only twenty-two books which contain the records of all time, and are justly believed to be divine." These 22 books make up the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;/ref&gt; reported also by the Christian bishop [[Athanasius]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible-researcher.com/athanasius.html There are, then, of the Old Testament, twenty-two books in number]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Origen of Alexandria]] (c. 240 AD) also records 22 canonical books of the Hebrew Bible cited by Eusebius; among them are the [[Epistle of Jeremiah]] and the [[Books of the Maccabees|Maccabees]] as canonical books.

{{quote|The twenty-two books of the Hebrews are the following: That which is called by us Genesis; Exodus; Leviticus; Numbers; Jesus, the son of Nave (Joshua book); Judges and Ruth in one book; the First and Second of Kings (1 Samuel and 2 Samuel) in one; the Third and Fourth of Kings (1 Kings and 2 Kings) in one; of the Chronicles, the First and Second in one; Esdras (Ezra–Nehemiah) in one; the book of Psalms; the Proverbs of Solomon; Ecclesiastes; the Song of Songs; Isaiah; Jeremiah, with Lamentations and the epistle (of Jeremiah) in one; Daniel; Ezekiel; Job; Esther.

In the 7th century Latin document the [[Muratorian fragment]], which some scholars actually believe to be a copy of an earlier 170 AD Greek original, the book of the Wisdom of Solomon is counted by the church.

[[Eusebius]] wrote in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'' (c. 324 AD) that Bishop [[Melito of Sardis]] in the 2nd century AD considered the deuterocanonical [[Wisdom of Solomon]] as part of the Old Testament and that it was considered canonical by Jews and Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250104.htm |title=Church Fathers: Church History, Book IV (Eusebius) |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the contrary claim has been made:  "In the catalogue of Melito, presented by Eusebius, after Proverbs, the word Wisdom occurs, which nearly all commentators have been of opinion is only another name for the same book, and not the name of the book now called 'The Wisdom of Solomon'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/alexander_a/canon.iii.iii.html |title=Canon of the Old and New Testaments Ascertained, or The Bible Complete without the Apocrypha and Unwritten Traditions. – Christian Classics Ethereal Library |publisher=Ccel.org |date=15 November 2006 |accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]]'s canonical books list (367 AD) the [[Book of Baruch]] and the [[Letter of Jeremiah]] are included and [[Esther, Book of|Esther]] is omitted. At the same time, he mentioned that certain other books, including four deuterocanonical books (the Wisdom of Solomon, the Wisdom of Sirach, Judith and Tobit), the book of Esther and also the [[Didache]] and [[The Shepherd of Hermas]], while not being part of the Canon, "were appointed by the Fathers to be read".

===Synods===
In later copyings of the canons of the [[Council of Laodicea]] (from 364 AD) a canon list became appended to Canon 59, likely before the mid fifth century, which affirmed that Jeremiah, and Baruch, the Lamentations, and the Epistle (of Jeremiah) were canonical, while excluding the other deuterocanonical books.&lt;ref name="Synod of Laodicea Canon 60" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gallagher|first1=Edmon.L.|last2= Meade|first2= John.D.|title=The Biblical Canon Lists of Early Christianity|publisher=OUP|date = 2017|pages= 131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council of Rome]] (382 AD), where the [[Decretum Gelasianum]], which is a work written by an anonymous scholar between 519 and 553, cites a list of books of Scripture presented as having been made canonical by the Council of Rome. This list mentions all the deuterocanonical books except Baruch and the Letter of Jermiah as a part of the Old Testament Canon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tertullian.org/decretum_eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Synod of Hippo]] (in 393 AD), followed by the [[Council of Carthage (397)]] and the [[Council of Carthage (419)]], may be the first councils that explicitly accepted the first canon which includes a selection of books that did not appear in the [[Hebrew Bible]];&lt;ref&gt;McDonald &amp; Sanders, editors of ''The Canon Debate'', 2002, chapter 5: ''The Septuagint: The Bible of Hellenistic Judaism'' by Albert C.

{{quote|Five books of Moses, namely Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; Joshua, Judges, Ruth, four books of Kings, two of Paralipomenon (Chronicles), Esdras (Ezra), Nehemiah, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Job, Psalms of David, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Baruch, Ezechiel, Daniel; the twelve minor prophets, namely Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi; two books of the Maccabees.}}

Finally the [[Council of Trent]] (1546 AD) adopted an understanding of the canons of these previous councils as corresponding to its own list of deuterocanonical books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/COUNCILS/TRENT4.htm Session IV Celebrated on the eighth day of April, 1546 under Pope Paul III]&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding rested on two historical presumptions which are contested in current research; that the where these councils and synods noted the 'Book of Jeremiah', they intended the Book of Baruch to be silently understood (including the [[Letter of Jeremiah]]);&lt;ref name="Bogaert Baruch" /&gt; and that where these synods and councils noted 'two books of Esdras', these two books were to be understood as [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]] counted separately; not (as was universal in Septuagint manuscripts of the time, in the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin Bible]] and in the works of Augustine) as [[1 Esdras]] and [[Ezra-Nehemiah]].&lt;ref name="Bogaert livres d'Esdras" /&gt;

===Influence of Jerome===
[[Jerome]] in the [[Vulgate#Prologues|Vulgate's prologues]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bible/prologi.shtml ''Prologues of St. Jerome'', Latin text]&lt;/ref&gt; describes a canon which excludes the deuterocanonical books. In his ''Prologues'', Jerome mentions all of the deuterocanonical and apocryphal works by name as being apocryphal or "not in the canon" except for ''[[Prayer of Manasseh|Prayer of Manasses]]'' and ''Baruch''. He mentions ''Baruch'' by name in his ''Prologue to Jeremiah''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/?p=233 |website=Biblicalia |date=14 August 2006 |first=Kevin P. |last=Edgecomb |title=Jerome's Prologue to Jeremiah}}&lt;/ref&gt; and notes that it is neither read nor held among the Hebrews, but does not explicitly call it apocryphal or "not in the canon".&lt;ref&gt;Since some ancients counted Baruch as part of Jeremiah, it is conceivable though unlikely that Jerome counted Baruch under the name of Jeremiah when he enumerated the canon in his ''Prologus Galeatus''.&lt;/ref&gt; The inferior status to which the deuterocanonical books were relegated by authorities like Jerome is seen by some as being due to a rigid conception of canonicity, one demanding that a book, to be entitled to this supreme dignity, must be received by all, must have the sanction of Jewish antiquity, and must moreover be adapted not only to edification, but also to the "confirmation of the doctrine of the Church".&lt;ref name="canonOT" /&gt;

J. N. D. Kelly states that "Jerome, conscious of the difficulty of arguing with Jews on the basis of books they spurned and anyhow regarding the Hebrew original as authoritative, was adamant that anything not found in it was 'to be classed among the apocrypha', not in the canon; later he grudgingly conceded that the Church read some of these books for edification, but not to support doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelly|first1=J. N. D.|title=Early Christian Doctrines|date=1960|publisher=Harper|location=San Francisco|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually however, Jerome's [[Vulgate]] did include the deuterocanonical books as well as [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]]. Jerome referenced and quoted from some as scripture despite describing them as "not in the canon". Michael Barber asserts that, although Jerome was once suspicious of the apocrypha, he later viewed them as Scripture. Barber argues that this is clear from Jerome's epistles; he cites Jerome's letter to [[Eustochium]], in which Jerome quotes Sirach 13:2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Michael |last=Barber |url=http://www.thesacredpage.com/2006/03/loose-canons-development-of-old_06.html |title=Loose Canons: The Development of the Old Testament (Part 2) |date=6 March 2006 |accessdate=1 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere Jerome apparently also refers to Baruch, the Story of Susannah and Wisdom as scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, To Paulinus, Epistle 58 (A.D. 395), in NPNF2, VI:119.: "Do not, my dearest brother, estimate my worth by the number of my years. Gray hairs are not wisdom; it is wisdom which is as good as gray hairs At least that is what Solomon says: 'wisdom is the gray hair unto men.' [Wisdom 4:9]" Moses too in choosing the seventy elders is told to take those whom he knows to be elders indeed, and to select them not for their years but for their discretion [Num. 11:16]? And, as a boy, Daniel judges old men and in the flower of youth condemns the incontinence of age [Daniel 13:55–59 aka Story of Susannah 55–59]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, To Oceanus, Epistle 77:4 (A.D. 399), in NPNF2, VI:159.: "I would cite the words of the psalmist: 'the sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,' [Ps 51:17] and those of Ezekiel 'I prefer the repentance of a sinner rather than his death,' [Ez 18:23] and those of Baruch, 'Arise, arise, O Jerusalem,' [Baruch 5:5] and many other proclamations made by the trumpets of the Prophets."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, Letter 51, 6, 7, NPNF2, VI:87–8: "For in the book of Wisdom, which is inscribed with his name, Solomon says: 'God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity.' [Wisdom 2:23]...Instead of the three proofs from Holy Scripture which you said would satisfy you if I could produce them, behold I have given you seven"&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Barker states that Jerome quotes the Apocrypha with marked respect, and even as "Scripture", giving them an ecclesiastical if not a canonical position and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker|first1=Henry|title=English Bible Versions|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press,|isbn=978-1108024549|page=33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tRk7FHkAuEAC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=jerome+quotes+from+apocrypha+but+they+did+not+consider+scripture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQm6KM7frPAhVBGz4KHUgDALAQ6AEINDAE#v=snippet&amp;q=jerome%20quotes%20%20the%20apocrypha%20%20%20%20%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther also wrote introductions to the books of the Apocrypha, and occasionally quoted from some to support an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=S. Werrell|first1=Ralph|title=The Roots of William Tyndale's Theology|date=29 August 2013|publisher=James Clarke &amp; Co|isbn=978-0227174029|page=57|edition=paperback|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kaAABAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=luther+quotes+from+apocrypha+but+they+did+not+consider+scripture&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his prologue to [[Book of Judith|Judith]], without using the word canon, Jerome mentioned that Judith was held to be scriptural by the [[First Council of Nicaea]].

{{quote|Among the Hebrews the Book of Judith is found among the [[Hagiographa]]... But because this book is found by the Nicene Council to have been counted among the number of the Sacred Scriptures, I have acquiesced to your request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bombaxo.com/blog/jeromes-prologue-to-judith/ |title=Jerome's Prologue to Judith |website=Biblicalia |date=5 August 2006 |first=Kevin P. |last=Edgecomb}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In his reply to [[Rufinus of Aquileia|Rufinus]], Jerome affirmed that he was consistent with the choice of the church regarding which version of the deuterocanonical portions of Daniel to use, which the Jews of his day did not include:

{{quote|What sin have I committed in following the judgment of the churches? But when I repeat what the Jews say against the [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Story of Susanna]] and the [[The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children|Hymn of the Three Children]], and the fables of [[Bel and the Dragon]], which are not contained in the Hebrew Bible, the man who makes this a charge against me proves himself to be a fool and a slanderer; for I explained not what I thought but what they commonly say against us. (''Against Rufinus'', II:33 [AD 402]).&lt;ref name=Schaff27102&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/27102.htm |chapter=Apology Against Rufinus (Book II) |title=Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Second Series |volume=3 |author=Jerome |editor=Philip Schaff, Henry Wace |location=Buffalo, NY |publisher=Christian Literature Publishing Co. (retrieved from New Advent) |edition=1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus Jerome acknowledged the principle by which the canon would be settled – the judgment of the Church (at least the local churches in this case) rather than his own judgment or the judgment of Jews; though concerning translation of Daniel to Greek, he wondered why one should use the version of a translator whom he regarded as [[heresy|heretic]] and [[judaizer]] ([[Theodotion]]).&lt;ref name=Schaff27102/&gt;

The Vulgate is also important as the touchstone of the canon concerning which parts of books are canonical. When the [[Council of Trent]] listed the books included in the canon, it qualified the books as being "entire with all their parts, as they have been used to be read in the Catholic Church, and as they are contained in the old Latin vulgate edition".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible-researcher.com/trent1.html Canons and Decrees of the Council of Trent, The Fourth Session], 1546.&lt;/ref&gt; This decree was clarified somewhat by [[Pope Pius XI]] on 2 June 1927, who allowed that the [[Comma Johanneum]] was open to dispute, and it was further explicated by [[Pope Pius XII]]'s ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The Council of Trent also promulgated the [[Vulgate]] bible as the official Latin version of the Bible for the Roman Catholic Church.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} [[Jerome]], the translator of most of this version in the early 5th century had translated the Old Testament books afresh directly from the Hebrew Bible, rather than from the Greek [[Septuagint]], and had then explicitly rejected all Septuagint books and passages not found in the Hebrew as "apocryphal"; and although he had subsequently translated some of these texts under sufferance (marking them with an [[obelus]]), he had maintained throughout that none of these books and additions were canonical and recorded this opinion in his prologues to each book. In the medieval period however, Latin translations of the Septuagint books that Jerome had refused altogether to translate had nevertheless become widely included in the Vulgate Bible; as too had Latin versions of other texts that had never been found in the Septuagint at all.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Council of Trent therefore needed to clarify which of the Old Testament books in 16th century Vulgate bibles were in the canon; and which were not.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==In the Roman Catholic Church==
{{see also|Catholic Bible}}{{anchor|Catholicism}}
[[Philip Schaff]] says that "the [[Synod of Hippo|Council of Hippo]] in 393, and the third (according to another reckoning the sixth) [[Council of Carthage (397)|Council of Carthage]] in 397, under the influence of Augustine, who attended both, fixed the catholic canon of the Holy Scriptures, including the Apocrypha of the Old Testament, ... This decision of the transmarine church however, was subject to ratification; and the concurrence of the [[Roman see]] it received when [[Innocent I]] and [[Gelasius I]] (AD 414) repeated the same index of biblical books. Schaff says that this canon remained undisturbed till the sixteenth century, and was sanctioned by the [[Council of Trent]] at its fourth session,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/history/3_ch09.htm |title=History of the Christian Church |chapter=Chapter IX. Theological Controversies, and Development of the Ecumenical Orthodoxy |author=Philip Schaff |publisher=CCEL}}&lt;/ref&gt; although as the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' reports, "in the Latin Church, all through the Middle Ages we find evidence of hesitation about the character of the deuterocanonicals... Few are found to unequivocally acknowledge their canonicity," but that the countless manuscript copies of the Vulgate produced by these ages, with a slight, probably accidental, exception, uniformly embrace the complete Roman Catholic Old Testament.&lt;ref name="canonOT"&gt;{{Catholic Encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03267a.htm|title=Canon of the Old Testament|no-icon=1|prescript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Old Latin version of the bible, these two works appear to have been incorporated into the [[Book of Jeremiah]], and Latin Fathers of the 4th century and earlier always cite their texts as being from that book. However, when Jerome translated Jeremiah afresh from the Hebrew text, which is considerably longer than the Greek Septuagint text and with chapters in a different order, he steadfastly refused to incorporate either Baruch or the Letter of Jeremiah from the Greek. As the Vulgate bible supplanted the Old Latin in western church use in subsequent centuries, so Baruch and the letter of Jeremiah are no longer treated as canonical in the works of Fathers who favoured the Vulgate; [[Gregory the Great]], [[Isidore of Seville]] and [[Bede]]. In the 9th century these two works were reintroduced into the Vulgate bibles produced under the influence of [[Theodulf of Orleans]], originally as additional chapters to the Vulgate book of Jeremiah. Subsequently, and especially in the Paris Bibles of the 13th century, they are found together as a single, combined book after [[Lamentations]].&lt;ref name="Bogaert Baruch"&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=115|issue=2|pages=286–342|last=Bogaert|first=Pierre-Maurice|title=Le livre de Baruch dans les manuscrits de la Bible latine. Disparition et réintégration|journal=Revue Benedictine|date=2005|doi=10.1484/J.RB.5.100598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The canonical status of [[1 Esdras|Greek Esdras]] in the Western church is less easy to track; as references to [[Esdras]] in canon lists may refer either to this book, or to Greek [[Ezra-Nehemiah]], or both. Greek Esdras provides a free translation into Greek of the Hebrew canonical book of [[Ezra-Nehemiah]] plus chapters 35 and 36 of the [[Book of Chronicles]] with other additional matter; but with the sections specific to Nehemiah removed. In the surviving Greek pandect bibles of the 4th and 5th centuries; this text always stands as 'Esdras A' while the Greek translation of the whole of canonical [[Ezra-Nehemiah]] stands as 'Esdras B'; and the same is found in the surviving witness of the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin Bible]].&lt;ref name="DeGregorio"&gt;{{cite book|last=DeGregorio|first=Scott|title=Bede on Ezra and Nehemiah|publisher=Liverpool University Press|date = 2006|pages= xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Latin fathers of the early church cite quotations from 'Ezra' it is overwhelmingly 'Esdras A' to which they refer; as in Augustine 'City of God' 18:36. Citations of the 'Nehemiah' sections of Old Latin 'Esdras B' are much rarer; and no Old Latin citations from the 'Ezra' sections of 'Esdras B' are known before [[Bede]] in the 8th century.&lt;ref name="DeGregorio" /&gt; Accordingly, Bogaert has proposed that all references to the 'two books of Ezra' in both Latin and Greek authorities and councils may be best understood as denoting Esdras A and Esdras B; where most previous scholars had interpreted this phrase as an early reference to Ezra and Nehemiah as separate works.&lt;ref name="Bogaert livres d'Esdras"&gt;{{Cite journal|volume=110|issue=1–2|pages=5–26|last=Bogaert|first=Pierre-Maurice|title=Les livres d'Esdras et leur numérotation dans l'histoire du canon de la Bible latin|journal=Revue Benedictine|date=2000|doi=10.1484/J.RB.5.100750}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Jerome's Vulgate bible however, there is only one Book of Ezra, translating Hebrew Ezra-Nehemiah and corresponding to Greek Esdras B; Esdras A being considered by Jerome as a variant version of the Hebrew originals. In the prologue to [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] Jerome states that [[1 Esdras|3 Esdras]] and [[2 Esdras|4 Esdras]] are apocryphal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_preface_ezra.htm|title=St. Jerome, The Prologue on the Book of Ezra: English translation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 9th century, occasional Latin Vulgate manuscripts are found in which Jerome's single Ezra text is split to form the separate books of [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]]; and in the Paris bibles of the 13th century this split has become universal, with Esdras A being reintroduced as '[[1 Esdras|3 Esdras']] and [[2 Esdras|Latin Esdras]] being added as '4 Esdras'.&lt;ref name="Bogaert livres d'Esdras" /&gt; At the Council of Trent neither '[[1 Esdras|3 Esdras']] nor [[2 Esdras|4 Esdras]] were accepted as deuterocanonical books; but were eventually printed in the section of '[[Apocrypha]]' in the [[Sixto-Clementine Vulgate]], along with the [[Prayer of Manasses]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The [[Council of Trent]] in 1546 restated the list of books included in the canon as it had been set out in the [[Council of Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=OUP|author=Hamilton|first=Alastair|title=The Copts and the West; 1439–1822|pages=54|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In respect of the deuterocanonical books this list conformed with the canon lists of Western synods of the late 4th century, other than including Baruch with the Letter of Jeremiah as a separate book, and in excluding [[1 Esdras|Greek Esdras]]&lt;ref name="canonOT" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct04.html Council of Trent, Session 4, 8 April 1546].&lt;/ref&gt; While the majority at Trent supported this decision there were participants in the minority who disagreed with accepting any other than the protocanonical books in the canon. Among the minority, at Trent, were Cardinals [[Seripando]] and [[Thomas Cajetan|Cajetan]], the latter an opponent of Luther at Augsburg.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Jedin, ''Papal Legate at the Council of Trent'' (St Louis: B.

==In Orthodox Christianity==
Outside the Roman Catholic Church, the term deuterocanonical is sometimes used, by way of analogy, to describe books that [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], and [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] included in the [[Old Testament]] that are not part of the Jewish [[Tanakh]], nor the [[Protestant Old Testament]]. Among Orthodox, the term is understood to mean that they were compiled separately from the primary canon, as explained in 2 Esdras, where Esdras is instructed to keep certain books separate and hidden.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
The Eastern Orthodox Churches have traditionally included all the books of the Septuagint in their Old Testaments. The Greeks use the word ''Anagignoskomena'' (Ἀναγιγνωσκόμενα "readable, worthy to be read") to describe the books of the Greek [[Septuagint]] that are not present in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. When Orthodox theologians use the term "deuterocanonical", it is important to note that the meaning is not identical to the Roman Catholic usage. In Orthodox Christianity, deuterocanonical means that a book is part of the corpus of the Old Testament (i.e. is read during the services) but has secondary authority. In other words, deutero (second) applies to authority or witnessing power, whereas in Roman Catholicism, deutero applies to chronology (the fact that these books were confirmed later), not to authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxanswers.org/answer/39/ Orthodox Answer To a Question About Apocrypha, Canon, Deuterocanonical – Answer #39] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314205050/http://www.orthodoxanswers.org/answer/39/ |date=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eastern Orthodox canon includes the deuterocanonical books listed above, plus [[3 Maccabees]] and [[1 Esdras]] (also included in the [[Clementine Vulgate]]), while Baruch is divided from the Epistle of Jeremiah, making a total of 49 Old Testament books in contrast with the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] 39-book canon.&lt;ref name = "Kimbrough"&gt;{{cite book| author = S. T. Kimbrough| title = Orthodox And Wesleyan Scriptual Understanding And Practice| url = https://books.google.com/?id=q-vhwjamOioC&amp;pg=PA23| year = 2005| publisher = St Vladimir's Seminary Press| isbn = 978-0-88141-301-4| page = 23 }} as well as the 46 Old Testament books of the Roman Catholic Bible].&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Roman Catholic deuterocanonical books, these texts are integrated with the rest of the Old Testament, not printed in a separate section.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Other texts printed in Orthodox Bibles are considered of some value (like the additional [[Psalm 151]], and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]]) or are included as an appendix (like the Greek [[4 Maccabees]], and the Slavonic [[2 Esdras]]).&lt;ref name=Kimbrough/&gt;

===Ethiopian Orthodoxy===
In the [[Amharic]] Bible used by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] Church (an Oriental Orthodox Church), those books of the Old Testament that are still counted as canonical, but not by all other Churches, are often set in a separate section titled ''"Deeyutrokanoneekal"'' (ዲዩትሮካኖኒካል), which is the same word. The Ethiopian Orthodox Deuterocanon, in addition to the standard set listed above, along with the books of Esdras and ''Prayer of Minasse'', also includes some books that are still held canonical by only the Ethiopian Church, including Enoch or ''Henok'' ([[I Enoch]]), ''Kufale'' ([[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]]) and 1, 2 and 3 [[Meqabyan]] (which are sometimes wrongly confused with the "Books of Maccabees").{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==In Christian Churches having their origins in the Reformation==
{{Further|Biblical apocrypha}}
===Anglican Communion===
There is a great deal of overlap between the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] section of the original 1611 [[King James Bible]] and the Catholic deuterocanon, but the two are distinct. The Apocrypha section of the original 1611 King James Bible includes, in addition to the deuterocanonical books, the following three books, which were not included in the list of the canonical books by the [[Council of Trent]]:{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}
* [[1 Esdras]] ([[Vulgate]] 3 Esdras)
* [[2 Esdras]] (Vulgate 4 Esdras)
* [[Prayer of Manasseh]]

These books make up the [[Biblical apocrypha#Clementine Vulgate|Apocrypha]] section of the [[Vulgate#Clementine Vulgate|Clementine Vulgate]]: [[3 Esdras]] ([[1 Esdras]]); [[4 Esdras]] ([[2 Esdras]]); and the [[Prayer of Manasseh]], where they are specifically described as "outside of the series of the canon". The 1609 [[Douay–Rheims Bible|Douai Bible]] includes them in an appendix, but they have not been included in English Catholic Bibles since the [[Richard Challoner|Challoner]] revision of the Douai Bible in 1750. They are found, along with the deuterocanonical books, in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] section of certain Protestant Bibles (some versions of the King James, for example).{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Using the word apocrypha (Greek: hidden away) to describe texts, although not necessarily pejorative, implies to some people that the writings in question should not be included in the [[Biblical canon|canon]] of the [[Books of the Bible|Bible]]. This classification commingles them with certain non-canonical [[gospel]]s and [[New Testament apocrypha]]. ''The Society of Biblical Literature'' recommends the use of the term ''deuterocanonical books'' instead of ''Apocrypha'' in academic writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Society of Biblical Literature|first= |date= 2014|title= The SBL Handbook of Style 2nd Edition|url= |location= Williston, VT|publisher= SBL Press|page= 111|isbn= 978-1589839649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Thirty-nine Articles]] of Religion of the [[Church of England]] lists the deuterocanonical books as suitable to be read for "example of life and instruction of manners, but yet doth not apply them to establish any doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/book-of-common-prayer/articles-of-religion.aspx |title=Articles of Religion |publisher=The Church of England |chapter=VI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early lectionaries of the Anglican Church (as included in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of 1662) included the deuterocanonical books amongst the cycle of readings, and passages from them were used regularly in services (such as the Kyrie Pantokrator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/kyrie-pantokrator |title=Kyrie Patokrator |website=An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Benedicite]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Owen C. |last2=Wondra |first2=Ellen K. |title=Introduction to Theology, 3rd Edition |date=1 July 2002 |publisher=Church Publishing, Inc.|isbn=9780819218971 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Readings from the deuterocanonical books are now included in most, if not all, of the modern lectionaries in the [[Anglican Communion]], based on the [[Revised Common Lectionary]] (in turn based on the post-conciliar Roman Catholic [[lectionary]]), though alternative readings from protocanonical books are also provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Revised Common Lectionary |editor=Consultation on Common Texts |publisher=Augsburg Fortress |year=2012 |isbn=9781451438475 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lmg7UhF5rUEC |pages=177, 188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lutheran Churches===
Luther did not accept deuterocanonical books in his Old Testament, terming them "Apocrypha, that are books which are not considered equal to the Holy Scriptures, but are useful and good to read."&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC05742122&amp;id=rl3lcbLkHV0C&amp;pg=PA521&amp;lpg=PA521&amp;dq=luther+%22are+useful+and+good+to+read%22 The Popular and Critical Bible Encyclopædia and Scriptural Dictionary, Fully Defining and Explaining All Religious Terms, Including Biographical, Geographical, Historical, Archæological and Doctrinal Themes]'', p.521, edited by [[Samuel Fallows]] et al., The Howard-Severance company, 1901,1910. – [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presbyterian Churches===
The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], a [[Calvinist]] document that serves as a systematic summary of doctrine for the [[Church of Scotland]] and other [[Presbyterian]] Churches worldwide, recognizes only the sixty-six books of the [[Biblical canon#Canons of various Christian traditions|Protestant canon]] as authentic Scripture. Chapter 1, Article 3 of the Confession reads: "The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the Canon of Scripture; and therefore are of no authority in the Church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds3.iv.xvii.ii.html |title=Westminster Confession of Faith |chapter=Chapter I, III |website=www.ccel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformed Churches===
The [[Belgic Confession]], used in [[Reformed churches]], devotes a section (Article 6) to "The difference between the canonical and apocryphal books" and asserts that "All which the Church may read and take instruction from, so far as they agree with the canonical books; but they are far from having such power and efficacy as that we may from their testimony confirm any point of faith or of the Christian religion; much less to detract from the authority of the other sacred books."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RQQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA36&amp;lpg=RA1-PA36&amp;dq=%22All+which+the+Church+may+read+and+take+instruction+from,+so+far+as+they+agree+with+the+canonical+books;+but+they+are+far+from+having+such+power+and+efficacy+as+that+we+may+from+their+testimony+confirm+any+point+of+faith+or+of+the+Christian+religion;+much+less+to+detract+from+the+authority+of+the+other+sacred+books.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qXDt20kq05&amp;sig=pAOP7SzFP6AMr7rD2fMid6L7AJ0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwia8prw_4PdAhXEmeAKHWToA_AQ6AEwAXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22All%20which%20the%20Church%20may%20read%20and%20take%20instruction%20from,%20so%20far%20as%20they%20agree%20with%20the%20canonical%20books;%20but%20they%20are%20far%20from%20having%20such%20power%20and%20efficacy%20as%20that%20we%20may%20from%20their%20testimony%20confirm%20any%20point%20of%20faith%20or%20of%20the%20Christian%20religion;%20much%20less%20to%20detract%20from%20the%20authority%20of%20the%20other%20sacred%20books.%22&amp;f=false|title=The Psalms and hymns, with doctrinal standards and liturgy of the Reformed Church in America|last=America|first=Reformed Church in|date=1859|publisher=Board of Publications of the Reformed Church in America|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Jewish position==
{{main|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon}}
Judaism and most Protestant versions of the Bible exclude these books. It is commonly said that Judaism officially excluded the deuterocanonicals and the additional Greek texts listed here from their Scripture in the [[Council of Jamnia]] (c.&amp;nbsp;70–90&amp;nbsp;AD), but this claim is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Albert C. Sundberg, Jr., [http://department.monm.edu/classics/Speel_Festschrift/sundbergJr.htm "The Old Testament of the Early Church" Revisited 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament deuterocanonicals==
{{Main|Antilegomena}}
{{See also|Development of the New Testament canon}}
The term ''deuterocanonical'' is sometimes used to describe the canonical [[antilegomena]], those books of the [[New Testament]] which, like the deuterocanonicals of the Old Testament, were not universally accepted by the early Church. These books may be called the "New Testament deuterocanonicals",&lt;ref name=Akin&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/ANSWERS/DEUTEROS.HTM |title=Defending the Deuterocanonicals |author=James Akin |author-link=Jimmy Akin |publisher=[[EWTN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are now included in the 27 books of the [[New Testament]] recognized by almost all [[Christianity|Christians]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} The deuterocanonicals of the New Testament are as follows:{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}
* The [[Epistle to the Hebrews]]
* The [[Epistle of James]]
* The [[Second Epistle of Peter]]
* The [[Second Epistle of John]]
* The [[Third Epistle of John]]
* The [[Epistle of Jude]]
* The [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse of John]] (also known as the [[Book of Revelation]])

Luther made an attempt to remove the books of Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation from the canon (notably, he perceived them to go against his new doctrines such as ''[[sola gratia]]'' and ''[[sola fide]]''), but this was not generally accepted among his followers. However, these books are ordered last in the [[German language|German-language]] [[Luther Bible]] to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibelcenter.de/bibel/lu1545/ |title=Lutherbibel 1545 |website=Bibelarbeit |accessdate=5 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20010514151557/http://www.bibelcenter.de/bibel/lu1545/ |archivedate=14 May 2001 |df= }} note order: "...Hebräer, Jakobus, Judas, Offenbarung"; see also {{cite web |url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/links10.html |title=German Bible Versions |website=www.bible-researcher.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dhṛti''' or '''Dhriti''' ({{lang-sa|धृति}}) means to 'act with determination' ([[Bhagavad Gita]] Sl. XVIII.26), 'patience' ([[Bhagavata Purana|Srimad Bhagavatam]]  Sl. V.v.10-13), 'firmness' (''Caitanyacaritamrita Madhya'' Sl. XXIV.11), and refers to 'perseverance' (Caitanyacaritamrita Madhya Sl. XXIV.174), 'wearing regularly' (''Caitanyacaritamrita Madhya''  XXIV.333) and to one of the eleven  ''Rudranis'' ([[Bhagavata Purana|Srimad Bhagavatam]] Sl.III.xii.13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=dhrti|url= http://vedabase.net/d/dhrti}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no correct equivalent English word for  ''Dhrti'' which is derived from  ''dhr-'' meaning 'to bear'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads|publisher=Penguin|page=432|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cy9B-U-OVCwC&amp;pg=PA432&amp;dq=dhrti+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UN4FU5vfEs-4hAeXyoCgBw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dhrti'' meaning 'fortitude' and 'determination' is defined as the subtle faculty in man that makes him strive continuously towards a goal.

''Dhrti'' is the name of a [[Vedic]] [[metre]] of the type 12.12.8|12.8|12.8., and is a variety of the  ''Atichandas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic metre in its historical development|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=249|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6-k8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq=dhrti+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YOQFU9LJD8yBhAeCtoCoAw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the name of a yoga in [[Hindu Calendar]]. The [[Vedic]] [[Rishi]]s address their prayers to the [[Visvedevas]] just as they do the [[Adityas]] and the [[Maruts]]; who all as a group are the protectors of the ten [[Rta]]s including  ''Dhrti'' ('forebearance') which word represents an abstract idea like  ''Hri'' and  ''Kirti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Dharma: Introduction to Scriptures and Theology|author=Ashim Kumar Bhattacharya|publisher=iUniverse|page=152|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAcewrt08boC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=dhrti+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3ucFU4_8I5SShQfE6ICYBQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti%20vedas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the performance of the ''[[Ashvamedha|Ashvamedha yajna]]'', as mentioned in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'', ''Asvalayana-srauta-sutra'' and ''Sankhayana-srauta-sutra'', the ''[[Adhvaryu]]'' offered, for the safe movement of the Sacrificial Horse during day-time, three ''Istis'' daily to ''[[Savitr]]'' and at nightfall performed four ''Dhrti Homas'' for the safe sheltering of that horse during night-time. While the ''Dhrti Homas'' were in progress, a ''Rajanya'' (''[[Kshatriya]]'') lute-player (''veenagathi'') sang three songs (''[[Gatha]]'') made up of many verses in which he praised the royal-sacrificer with the mention of his heroic exploits, viz., the wars he waged, the battles he won, the conquests he made, so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Puranas Vol.1|author=Swami Parmeshwaranand|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons

The [[Purana]] Index lists ''Dhrti'', borne by ''Vijaya'', as one of the sons of ''[[Dharma]]'' who was the son of [[Brahma]], and who married all thirteen daughters of ''[[Daksha]]'', each of whom bore ''Dhrti'' a son. ''Dhrtavarta'' was the son of ''Dhrti'' and father of ''Satyakarma''. ''Nandi'' was a consort of ''Dhrti''. ''Niyama'' was a son of ''Dhrti''. And, ''Dhrti'' ('courage') is invoked in the ''Grahabalis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Purana Index|author=V.R.Ramachandra Dikshitar|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=159, 179, 199, 243, 677|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7bFwZhfSOsC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Stuti'' of ''[[Devi-Bhagavata Purana|Devi Bhagavatam]]'' (V.22.25-42), ''[[Shakti|Devi]]'', who is the Energy for the creation and destruction of the universe, has been praised as having many names and as residing in all in the form of ''[[shakti]]'' ('power and energy'), ''amrti'' ('memory'), ''dhrti'' ('steadfastness'), ''[[buddhi]] '' ('intelligence'), so on. According to the Puranas, ''[[Brahma]]'' is the creator, ''Mukunda'' (''[[Vishnu]] '') is the preserver and ''[[Hara (Hinduism)|Hara]]'' (''[[Rudra]]) is the destroyer but they themselves are created by Devi at the beginning of a [[yuga]], therefore, she is the mother of all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Purana Vol.VIII|publisher=All-India Kashiraj Trust, Fort Ramnagar, Varanasi|url= https://archive.org/stream/puranavolviii015194mbp/puranavolviii015194mbp_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Implication==

''Dhrti'' meaning 'fortitude' and 'determination' is defined as the subtle faculty in man that makes him strive continuously towards a goal. It provides courage, enthusiasm and perseverance to face and overcome all odds and obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Holy Gita Ready Reference|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=417|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNNGYOGoibgC&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the three types of  ''Dhrtis'' mentioned in the Bhagavad [[Gita]], Swami Tejomayananda states that  ''Sattvic dhrti'' is the unswerving fortitude with which one works for a noble cause with enthusiasm and dedication, despite obstacles; ''Rajasic dhrti'' is the fortitude displayed for a while, in a part, place or under particular circumstances to achieve particular goals and may dissolve under different circumstances and situations, and  ''Tamasic dhrti'' is the stubbornness with which one holds on to the false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ponder Awhile|author=Swami Tejomayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SbYR4Bw39ckC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two factors that supply the fuel and the motive force in all sustained endeavours are - ''buddhi'' ('understanding') and ''dhrti'' ('fortitude'), the former is 'the intellectual capacity to grasp what is happening' and the latter is 'the constancy of purpose and self-application'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Holy Gita Ready Reference|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=433|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNNGYOGoibgC&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abhinavagupta]] states that since everyone works therefore, everyone possesses  ''dhrti''; he holds  ''buddhi'' to mean 'resolution' and  ''dhrti'' to mean 'satisfaction'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gitarthasangrha|author=Abhinavagupta|publisher=BRILL|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9oUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y2UFU4mjMtOShQeeu4CIAQ&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], four things viz. [[Śruti]] and [[Smriti]] which are society’s codes of ethics, ''sadacara'' which is good noble conduct accepted by society; and ''svasya ca priyam atmanah'' which is one’s own joy and pleasure, determine [[Dharma]]. The ''sanatana dharma'' is the eternal universal values to be followed by all people in life, and ''varnasrama dharma'' consists of specific duties given to each individual; Dharma means that holds everyone and everything together which leads to material prosperity and spiritual realization in this life itself. According to [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], ''Dhrti'' is one of the ten values necessary for all people at all times that characterize Dharma. ''Dhrti'' means fortitude; it means the capacity to hold on to something. It is the ''sattavic dhrti'' which is strength, force and ability that makes us hold on to noble values of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Culture|author=Swami Tejomayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|pages=95–96|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5VZtNRl24fsC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sattavic dhrti'' and ''Sattvic buddhi'' are mutually related terms. [[Krishna]] explains to [[Arjuna]] ([[Bhagavad Gita]] Sl. XVIII.30):

:प्रवृति च निवृति च कार्याकार्ये भयाभये |
:बन्धं मोक्षं च या वेत्ति बुद्धिः सा पार्थ सात्त्विकी ||

that "That which knows the paths of work and renunciation, what ought to be done and what not to be done, fear and fearlessness, bondage and liberation, that  'understanding' is  ''sattvic'' ('pure')." Which means the function of the intellect is discrimination, the faculty of 'right understanding ' (''buddhi'') which gives real joy, success and prosperity. With regard to sattvic dhrti he states ([[Bhagavad Gita]] l. XVIII.33):

:धृत्या यया धारयते मनः प्राणेन्द्रियकिर्याः |
:योगेनव्यभिचरिण्या धृतिः सा पार्थ सात्त्विकी ||

that the unwavering 'fortitude' by which through [[Yoga]] the functions of the mind, the [[Prana]] and the senses are restrained, that 'fortitude', is ''sattvic'' ('pure').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimad Bhagavad Gita Chapter XVIII|author=Swami Chinmayananda|publisher=Chinmaya Mission|pages=67, 75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMX3-54zcYMC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] in his Bhasya on the Bhagavad Gita explains that 'action' (way of works) is movement leading to bondage and 'inaction' (renunciation) leads to liberation. The remote expression – unwavering or unfaltering or unbroken concentration, should be related to resolve or  ''dhrti''; the sense is that the functions of the mind and so forth, maintained through unfaltering resolve, are in fact maintained through concentration. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita Bhasya of Sankaracarya|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=578-580|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/bhagavad-gita-bhashya-sankara/|quote=Bhagavad Gita Slokas XVIII.30-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yogic relevance==

[[Patanjali]]’s [[Yoga Sutra]] II.28 reads:-

:योगाङगानुष्ठानादशुध्दिक्षये ज्ञानदीप्तिराविवेकख्यातेः |

:"From the consistent practice of the parts of the Yoga-process, on the elimination of the impurity, the radiant organ of perception becomes manifest, until there is a steady discriminative insight."

This means – as impurities are eliminated through the observance of the steps of [[yoga]], a gradual kindling of knowledge occurs up to the full illumination of discriminatory wisdom. Discriminatory wisdom as virtue is the cause of happiness, and both, Vyasa and Vijnanabhikshu in their commentaries list nine causes including as the ninth cause  ''Dhrti'' here meaning sustenance; and agree that the  ''yoga-angas'' eradicate the impurity in both tangible (''drshta'') and intangible (''adrshta'') ways i.e. the physical practices such as purification (''shaucha''), and through  ''japa''. Elimination means disappearance of the veil on the  ''sattva mind-field''. The body is the sustainer of the senses being their resort but the senses sustain the body by way of providing spiritual and material welfare. The gross elements are the sustainers of the body and also sustain each other; the diverse sub-human, human and celestial bodies are mutually the sustainers and the sustained. ''Dhrti'' also means patience, remaining true to duty even in calamities, and perfection in maintaining wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga Sutras Of Patanjali|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=445, 450, 465, 675, 677|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2G3KR32j-T4C&amp;pg=PA677&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaishno relevance==

Verse II.vi.145 of  ''Sri Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu'' states – the steadiness of heart arising from attaining realization of the Lord, from absence of suffering in attaining the realization of the Lord, and from realizing  ''prema'' with the Lord is called  ''dhrti''; in this state there is no lamentation for things not attained or for things that have disappeared. ''Ksama'' ('tolerance') is included in  ''dhrti-bhava''. The three types of  ''rati'' ('relationship of love', 'attraction') are  ''priti'' ('affection'), '' sakhya'' ('friendship') and  ''vatsalya'', ''dhrti'' along with  ''vitarka'' ('conjecture'), '' mati'' ('scriptural conclusion'), ''nirveda'' ('self-disgust'), ''smrti '' ('remembrance'), ''harsa'' ('joy'), and the type of  ''bodha'' arising from destruction of ignorance become somewhat causes of  ''rati''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu Part 1|publisher=David Bruce Hughes|page=279,293,295,317|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vuncDaOZSDkC&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=dhrti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JV8FU6PBIoOjhgfaioGQAQ&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dhrti&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Gutas studied classical philology, religion, history, Arabic and Islamic studies at Yale University, where he received his doctorate in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dimitri Gutas|url=http://nelc.yale.edu/dimitri-gutas|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His main research interests are the classical Arabic and the intellectual tradition of the Middle Ages in the Islamic culture,&lt;ref name=Lori&gt;{{cite web|last=Harwood|first=Lori|title=The Social Contexts of Medieval Arabic Science|url=http://uanews.org/node/9141|publisher=The University of Arizona|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially [[Avicenna]], and the ''Graeco-Arabica'', which is the reception and the tradition of Greek works on medicine, science and philosophy in the Arab-Islamic world (especially from the 8th to the 10th century in Baghdad ). In this field he is considered one of the leading experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCollum|first=Adam|title=Review of Dimitri Gutas, Theophrastus, On First Principles (known as his Metaphysics), Philosophia Antiqua 119.|journal=Bryn Mawr Classical Review|date=2011-11-31|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2011/2011-11-31.html|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a co-editor in Yale's Project [[Theophrastus]]. He worked with Professor Gerhard Endress of [[Ruhr University Bochum]] in Germany to create the ''Greek and Arabic Lexicon''.

Gutas is a member of the advisory board of numerous journals, including the leading journal [[Arabic Sciences and Philosophy]] (Cambridge University Press)&lt;ref name=CUP_Editors&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial Board|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayMoreInfo?jid=ASP&amp;type=eb|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and co-editor and contributors to the revision of the ''Ueberweg'', a comprehensive history of philosophy.

In 2011 the book ''Islamic philosophy, science, culture, and religion : studies in honor of Dimitri Gutas'' was published by [[Brill Publishers]] with articles by friends, colleagues and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic philosophy, science, culture, and religion : studies in honor of Dimitri Gutas|url=http://www.brill.nl/islamic-philosophy-science-culture-and-religion|publisher=Brill Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9250">'''Earning to give''' involves deliberately pursuing a high-earning career for the purpose of donating a significant portion of earned income, typically because of a belief in [[effective altruism]].

Advocates of earning to give sometimes suggest that maximizing the amount one can donate to charity is an important consideration for individuals when deciding what career to pursue, even if the individual has less [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] interest in high-earning careers.&lt;ref name=kristof&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-the-trader-who-donates-half-his-pay.html?_r=0|title = The Trader Who Donates Half His Pay|last= Kristof|first = Nicholas|authorlink = Nicholas Kristof|date = April 4, 2015|accessdate = April 10, 2015|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents==
In the 1996 book ''[[Living High and Letting Die]]'', the philosopher [[Peter Unger]] wrote that it was morally praiseworthy and perhaps even morally required for people in academia who could earn substantially greater salaries in the business world to leave academia, earn the greater salaries, and donate most of the extra money to charity.&lt;ref name="Unger"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unger|first1=Peter|title=Living High and Letting Die|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198026811}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]] has laid the foundations for effective altruism and earning to give in his 1971 essay "[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality|''Famine, Affluence and Morality'']]" and since advocated for donating considerable amounts of one's income to effective charitable organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-singer-on-the-ethics-of-philanthropy-1428083293|title=Peter Singer on the Ethics of Philanthropy|last=Wolfe|first=Alexandra|date=2015-04-03|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-04-04|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer is a public proponent of effective altruism and endorsed earning to give in his 2013 [[TED talk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=The why and how of effective altruism|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism|language=en|accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associate Professor in Philosophy at Oxford University [[William MacAskill]] promoted earning to give as one possible high impact career in several news articles and in his 2015 book [[Doing Good Better|''Doing Good Better: Effective Altruism and a Radical New Way to Make a Difference'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/57254/to-save-the-world-dont-get-a-job-at-a-charity-go-work-on-wall-street/|title=To save the world, don’t get a job at a charity; go work on Wall Street|work=Quartz|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/09/10/working-for-a-hedge-fund-could-be-the-most-charitable-thing-you-do/|title=Working for a hedge fund could be the most charitable thing you do|last=MacAskill|first=William|date=2015-09-10|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=MacAskill|first2=William|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacAskill is the co-founder and president of [[80,000 Hours]], a nonprofit which conducts research on careers with positive social impact and provides career advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/about/meet-the-team/|title=Meet the team - 80,000 Hours|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization recommends earning to give as a career path with a high impact potential for effective altruists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give/|title=Why and how to earn to give - 80,000 Hours|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/|title=Join Wall Street.

==In practice==
Many of the people who practice earning to give consider themselves to be part of the effective altruism community.&lt;ref name=kristof/&gt;&lt;ref name=dailymail&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2334682/Young-professionals-joining-Wall-Street-save-world.html|title = The young professionals who believe their best chance at trying to save the world is by joining Wall Street and making millions|publisher = ''[[Daily Mail]]''|date = June 2, 2013|accessdate = April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacFarquhar|first1=Larissa|title=Strangers Drowning|date=2015|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=1594204330}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some donate up to 50% of their income, more than the 10% required for the basic [[Giving What We Can]] pledge.&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt; They may live frugally to donate more money.&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar" /&gt; Financial careers are popular for those pursuing earning to give.&lt;ref name="dailymail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt;

==Debate==
[[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] criticized the concept in his ''[[New York Times]]'' opinion column,&lt;ref name=brooks&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?ref=opinion|title = The Way to Produce a Person|last = Brooks|first = David|date = 2013-06-03|accessdate = 2013-10-16|publisher = ''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that, while altruists may start doing "earning to give" to realize their deepest commitments, their values may erode over time, becoming progressively less altruistic. In addition, Brooks objected to the view on which altruists should turn themselves "into a machine for the redistribution of wealth." [[Peter Singer]] responded to these criticisms in his book ''The Most Good You Can Do'' by giving examples of people who have been earning to give for years without losing their altruistic motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.yupnet.org/2016/08/09/earning-to-give-leads-to-happiness/|title='Earning to Give' Leads to Happiness|date=2016-08-09|website=Yale Press Log|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; William MacAskill also defended the practice against Brooks' criticisms in ''[[The Washington Post]],'' arguing that even [[Friedrich Engels]] was earning to give to support the work of anti-capitalist [[Karl Marx]] financially.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Dana Goldstein]] has also criticized earning to give, prompting a response from [[Reihan Salam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/349841/rise-singerians-reihan-salam|title = The Rise of the Singerians|last = Salam|first = Reihan|date = May 31, 2013|accessdate = November 26, 2013|publisher = ''[[National Review]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 052.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Portion of [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''The Conjurer''. The central figure looks forward, steadily, intently, and with fixed attention. While other figures observe objects within the painting, and the woman in green appears to observe the viewer.]]

In [[critical theory]], [[sociology]], and [[psychoanalysis]], the '''gaze''' (translated from French ''le regard'') is the act of seeing and being seen.

Numerous [[existentialism|existentialists]] and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologists]] have addressed the concept of gaze beginning with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', Part 3, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] elaborated on gaze to illustrate a particular dynamic in power relations and disciplinary mechanisms in his ''[[Discipline and Punish]]''. [[Derrida]] also elaborated on the relations of animals and humans via the gaze in ''The Animal That Therefore I Am''. The concept of a male gaze was originally theorized by feminist film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]], and has since been applied to many other forms of media and technology, such as advertisements, the work space, and video games.

==In psychoanalysis==

In [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] psychoanalytic theory, it is the anxious state that comes with the awareness that one can be viewed. The psychological effect, Lacan argues, is that the subject loses a degree of autonomy upon realizing that he or she is a visible object. This concept is bound with his theory of the [[mirror stage]], in which a child encountering a mirror realizes that he or she has an external appearance. Lacan suggests that this gaze effect can similarly be produced by any conceivable object such as a chair or a television screen. This is not to say that the object behaves optically as a mirror; instead it means that the [[awareness]] of any object can induce an awareness of also ''being'' an object.

It has also been called an aspect of one of the "most powerful human forces"; that is, "the meeting of the face and the gaze" because "Only there do we exist for one another."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ove Knausgaard, "The Inexplicable," ''The New Yorker,'' May 25, 2015, page 32]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems of power and the gaze==
[[Michel Foucault]] first used the term "medical gaze" in ''[[The Birth of the Clinic]]'' to explain the process of medical diagnosis, power dynamics between doctors and patients, and the hegemony of medical knowledge in society. He elaborated on the gaze to illustrate a particular dynamic in power relations and disciplinary mechanisms in his ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'', such as surveillance and the function of related disciplinary mechanisms and self-regulation in a prison or school as an apparatus of power.

The gaze is not something one has or uses; rather, it is the relationship into which someone enters. As [[Marita Sturken]] and [[Lisa Cartwright]] write in ''Practices of Looking'', "The gaze is integral to systems of power and ideas about knowledge."&lt;ref name=Cartwright&gt;Sturken, Marita; Cartwright, Lisa. ''Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture''. Oxford University Press, 2009. p. 94, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Three main concepts that Foucault introduced are [[panopticism]], [[power/knowledge]], and [[biopower]]. These concepts all address self-regulation under systems of [[surveillance]]. This refers to how people modify their behaviour under the belief that they are constantly being watched even if they cannot directly see who or what is watching them. This possible surveillance, whether real or unreal, has self-regulating effects.&lt;ref&gt;Sturken, Marita and Lisa Cartwright. ''Practices of Looking: an introduction to visual culture''. Oxford University Press, 2009. pp. 106-108.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The male gaze ==
{{main article|Male gaze}}
In her 1975 essay ''Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema'', [[Laura Mulvey]] introduced the [[Second-wave feminism|second-wave feminist]] concept of "[[male gaze]]" as a feature of gender power asymmetry in film. The concept was present in earlier studies of the gaze,{{specify|date=June 2016}} but it was Mulvey who brought it to the forefront. Mulvey stated that women were objectified in film because heterosexual men were in control of the camera. Hollywood films played to the models of [[voyeurism]] and [[scopophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;Sturken, Marita and Lisa Cartwright. ''Practices of Looking: an introduction to visual culture''. Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has subsequently been influential in [[feminist film theory]] and [[media studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Sassatelli, Roberta. ''Interview with Laura Mulvey: Gender, Gaze and Technology in Film Culture''. Theory, Culture &amp; Society, September 2011, 28(5) p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The feminine gaze ==
{{Main article|Judith Butler}}

In [[Judith Butler]]'s 1990 book ''[[Gender Trouble]]'', she proposed the idea of the feminine gaze as a way in which men choose to perform their masculinity by using women as the ones who force men into self-regulation.

== Imperial gaze&lt;!-- linked from 'Male gaze'--&gt; ==
[[E. Ann Kaplan]] has introduced the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] concept of the imperial gaze, in which the observed find themselves defined in terms of the privileged observer's own set of value-preferences.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Ashcroft et al, ''Post-Colonial Studies'' (2000) p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of the colonised, the imperial gaze infantilizes and trivializes what it falls upon,&lt;ref&gt;Vijay Mishra, ''Bollywood Cinema'' (2002) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; asserting its command and ordering function as it does so.&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Yekani, ''The Privilege of Crisis'' (2011) p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan comments: "The imperial gaze reflects the assumption that the white western subject is central much as the male gaze assumes the centrality of the male subject."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Patricia Waugh, ''Literary Theory and Criticism'' (2006) p. 514&lt;/ref&gt;

== The oppositional gaze ==
In her 1992 essay titled "The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectatorship",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminism and Visual Cultural Reader|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=Amelia Jones|year=|isbn=|location=New York: Routledge, 2003|pages=94–105|chapter=The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectator|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bell hooks]] counters [[Laura Mulvey]]'s notion of the [[Male gaze|(male) gaze]] by introducing the oppositional gaze of Black women. This concept exists as the reciprocal of the normative white spectator gaze. As [[Laura Mulvey|Mulvey]]'s essay&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media and Cultural Studies: Keywords|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|publisher=Meenakshi Gigi Durham and Douglas Kellner|year=|isbn=|location=2001; Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2006|pages=342–352|chapter=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; contextualizes the [[Male gaze|(male) gaze]] and its objectification of white women, [[Bell hooks|hooks]] essay&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; opens "oppositionality [as] a key paradigm in the feminist analysis of the 'gaze' and of scopophilic regimes in Western culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thinking Differently: A Reader in European Women's Studies|last=Griffin|first=Gabriele, and Rosi Braidotti|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=London: Zed, 2002|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oppositional gaze remains a critique of rebellion due to the sustained and deliberate misrepresentation of Black women in cinema as characteristically [[Mammy archetype|Mammy]], [[Jezebel]] or Sapphire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.|first=West, Carolyn|date=2012-01-01|title=Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire, and Their Homegirls: Developing an "Oppositional Gaze" Toward the Images of Black Women|url=http://digitalcommons.tacoma.uw.edu/ias_pub/270/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postcolonial gaze===
First referred to by Edward Said as "orientalism", the term "post-colonial gaze" is used to explain the relationship that colonial powers extended to people of colonized countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward|title=Orientalism|year=1978|publisher=Vintage Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placing the colonized in a position of the "[[Other (philosophy)#Imperialism and colonialism|other]]" helped to shape and establish the colonial's identity as being the powerful conqueror, and acted as a constant reminder of this idea.&lt;ref name = Beardsell&gt;{{cite book|last=Beardsell|first=Peter|title=Europe and Latin America: Returning the Gaze|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The postcolonial gaze "has the function of establishing the subject/object relationship&amp;nbsp;... it indicates at its point of emanation the location of the subject, and at its point of contact the location of the object".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beardsell|first=Peter|title=Europe and Latin America: Returning the Gaze|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, this means that the colonizer/colonized relationship provided the basis for the colonizer's understanding of themselves and their identity.&lt;ref name = Beardsell/&gt; The role of the appropriation of power is central to understanding how colonizers influenced the countries that they colonized, and is deeply connected to the development of post-colonial theory. Utilizing postcolonial gaze theory allows formerly colonized societies to overcome the socially constructed barriers that often prohibit them from expressing their true [[Economic, social and cultural rights|cultural, social, economic]], and [[civil and political rights|political rights]].&lt;ref name = Beardsell/&gt;


'''The international gaze'''
The international gaze is the term used to describe the Neo Liberal and globalising manifestation of the imperial,- / post-colonial gaze. Both latter terms are helpful in defining the dominated status of developing countries. However, the international gaze offers a way of understanding how internationalism, seemingly neutral and optimistic in outlook, is deeply rooted in a discourse of advantage and power. It inculcates an implicit assumption of dominance by those empowered to be international, whilst obviating the innate power relations. This term is first used by A. Gardner-McTaggart (2018) in ''International Capital, International Schools, Leadership and Christianity

''
'''The male tourist gaze'''

The tourism image is created through cultural and ideological constructions and advertising agencies that have been male dominated. What is represented by the media assumes a specific type of tourist: white, Western, male, and heterosexual, privileging the gaze of the "master subject" over others.&lt;ref name="Privileging the Male Gaze"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pritchard and Morgan|first1=Annette and Nigel|title=Privileging the Male Gaze|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|date=2000|issue=27.4|pages=884–905|doi=10.1016/s0160-7383(99)00113-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the representation of the typical tourist because those behind the lens, the image, and creators are predominantly male, white, and Western. Those that do not fall into this category are influenced by its supremacy. Through these influences female characteristics such as youth, beauty, sexuality, or the possession of a man are desirable while the prevalence of stereotypes consisting of submissive and sensual women with powerful "macho" men in advertising are projected.&lt;ref name="Privileging the Male Gaze"/&gt;

'''George Allen''' (December 17, 1808 – May 28, 1876) was a noted college professor and clergyman.  He was born in [[Milton, Vermont]] in 1808, and was the son of U.S. Congressman [[Heman Allen (of Milton)]].

He graduated from the [[University of Vermont]] in 1827, and became a professor of languages at that school the following year.  He left that position in 1830.  The following year, he was admitted to the Vermont bar and married Mary Hancock Withington, with whom he would have four children.  He was ordained a minister in the [[Anglican Church|Episcopal Church]] in 1834.  He became the professor of languages at Delaware College in 1837, remaining at that post through 1845, when he became professor of Latin and Greek at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], in [[Philadelphia]].  Professor Allen published a "Life of Philidor," the chess-player (Philadelphia, 1863). He converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in 1847.  He died in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] in 1876.

{{Hinduism small}}
Several contemporary groups, collectively termed '''Hindu reform movements''' or '''Hindu revivalism''', strive to introduce regeneration and reform to [[Hinduism]], both in a religious or spiritual and in a societal sense. The movements started appearing during the [[Bengali renaissance]].

The religious aspect mostly emphasizes [[Vedanta]] tradition and mystical interpretations of Hinduism ("[[Neo-Vedanta]]"), and the societal aspect was an important element in the [[Indian independence movement]], aiming at a "Hindu" character of the society of the eventual [[Republic of India]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Hinduism}}
{{See also|Neo-Vedanta}}

From the 18th century onward India was being colonialised by the British. In contrast to the Muslim domination,{{dubious|date=November 2014}} this colonialisation had a huge impact on Indian society, where social and religious leaders tried to assimilate western culture and modernise [[Hindu culture]].{{sfn|Michaels|2004}} During the 19th century, Hinduism developed a large number of [[new religious movement]]s, partly inspired by the European [[Romanticism]], [[nationalism]], and [[esotericism]] ([[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]) popular at the time. Conversely and contemporaneously, India had a similar effect on [[European culture]] with [[Orientalism]], "Hindu style" architecture, reception of [[Buddhism in the West]] and similar.

==Social reform movements==
In social work, [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Vinoba Bhave]], [[Baba Amte]] and [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]] have been most important. [[Sunderlal Bahuguna]] created the ''[[chipko]]'' movement for the preservation of forestlands according to the Hindu ecological ideas.

One of the foremost movements in breaking the caste system and educating the downtrodden was the [[Lingayat]] movement spearheaded by [[Basavanna]] in the 12th century in [[Anubhava Mantapa]] in [[Basavakalyan|Kalyani]] of [[Karnataka]].  The less accessible [[Vedas]] were rejected and parallel [[Vachanas]] were compiled.

===Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP)===
{{Unreferenced|date=November 2018}}
The [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]], or VHP, was founded in 1964 by the second ''sarsanghachalak'' (chief) of the [[Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh]], Shri [[M._S._Golwalkar|Madhav Golwalkar]], with the core objective of consolidating and strengthening Hindu society and also to eradicate the caste system among Hindus, which they claim had "crept in during medieval times" and to unite Hindus. The VHP has openly advocated appointing [[Dalits]] (lowest strata in Hindu society) as [[Hindu priest|priests]] in [[Hindu temple|temples]] and also runs several medical camps, hospitals, schools and hostels in remote regions of India, primarily inhabited by Dalits and [[scheduled tribes|tribals]].

In recent years the VHP has emerged as one of the most active Hindu missionary organisations and has organised several mass [[Ghar Wapsi|conversion programs]] of Christians and Muslims who, they claim, were Hindus once upon a time back to Hinduism.

==Religious movements==

===Brahmo Samaj===
The [[Brahmo Samaj]] is a social and religious movement founded in [[Kolkata]] in 1828 by [[Ram Mohan Roy|Raja Ram Mohan Roy]]. The Brahmo Samaj movement thereafter resulted in the Brahmo religion in 1850 founded by [[Debendranath Tagore]] — better known as the father of [[Rabindranath Tagore]].

===Arya Samaj===
The [[Arya Samaj]] is a monotheistic [[Hindu]] [[reform movement]] founded in India by [[Dayananda Saraswati|Swami Dayananda]] in 1875 at Bombay. He was a [[sannyasin]] (ascetic) who believed in the [[infallible]] [[Moral absolutism|authority]] of the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref&gt;Hastings J. and Selbi J. (Ed.) [https://books.google.com/?id=i53tYSX9SZEC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=Swami+Dayananda+Saraswati&amp;cd=52#v=onepage&amp;q= ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics''] Kessinger 2003 part 3. p. 57. {{ISBN|0-7661-3671-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Arya Samaj believe in one God and reject the worship of idol Dayanand’s interpretation of the Vedas was both unique and radical; for example he taught that the Vedas unambiguously advocate monotheism. He stressed that the Vedas do not contain any mention of idol worship, because they teach that God is a non material, formless and metaphysical spirit and, further, emphasise the doctrine of [[karma]] and [[reincarnation]], the ideals of [[brahmacharya]] ([[chastity]]) and [[sanyasa]] ([[Sannyasa|renunciation]]). [[Dayananda]] claimed that the Veda is the only true scripture because God reveals His true word at the outset of creation (otherwise He would be imperfect by having deprived many human generations of true knowledge until the inception of today’s various religions) and that, most definitely, there is no place in it of a discriminatory or hereditary caste system.

It aimed to be a universal structure based on the authority of the [[Vedas]]. Dayananda stated that he wanted 'to make the whole world Aryan', i.e. he wanted to develop ''[[missionary]]'' Hinduism based on the universality of the Vedas. To this end, the Arya Samaj started [[Shuddhi]] movement in early 20th century to bring back [[Hinduism]] to people converted to [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]], set up schools and missionary organisations, and extended its activities outside India.[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the first prime minister of India in his book, [[The Discovery of India]] credits Arya Samaj in introducing [[Proselytism|proselytization]] in Hinduism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thursby|first1=G. R.|title=Hindu-Muslim relations in British India : a study of controversy, conflict, and communal movements in northern India 1923–1928|date=1975|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004043800|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=abcfAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=spencer+lavan+arya+samaj#v=onepage&amp;q=arya%20samaj&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Samaj has branches around the world and has a a significant  number of adherents among people of Indian ancestry in [[Guyana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Suriname]], the [[Caribbean]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].

===Neo-Vedanta===
{{Main|Neo-Vedanta|Swami Vivekananda}}

Swami Vivekananda was a central personality in the development of neo-Hinduism (also called Neo-Vedanta) in late 19th century and the early 20th century. His ideals and sayings have inspired numerous Indians as well as non-Indians, Hindus as well as non-Hindus. Among the prominent figures whose ideals were very much influenced by them were [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Gandhi]], [[Subhas Bose]], [[Satyendranath Bose]], [[Megh Nad Saha]], and [[Sister Nivedita]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

===Outside India===
In [[Indonesia]] several movements favour a return to [[Hinduism]] in [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Kalimantan]], and [[Sulawesi]]. [[Bali]]nese Hinduism, known as [[Agama Hindu Dharma]], has witnessed great resurgence in recent years. Shrii Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar (founder of [[Ananda Marga]]) initiated a new renaissance in the Indian world of [[samgeet]].

==Influence on the West==
{{main|Neo-Hindu movements in the West|Neo-Advaita}}

The Hindu traditions also influenced western religiosity. Early in the 19th century the first translations of Hindu texts appeared in the west, and inspired western philosophers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].{{sfn|Renard|2010}} [[Helena Blavatsky]] moved to India in 1879, and her [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]], founded in New York in 1875, evolved into a peculiar mixture of Western occultism and Hindu mysticism over the last years of her life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9825">'''Hyperfocus''' is an intense form of [[mind|mental]] [[attention|concentration]] or [[creative visualization|visualization]] that focuses [[consciousness]] on a subject, topic, or task.  In some individuals, various subjects or topics may also include [[daydream]]s, [[concept]]s, [[fiction]], the [[imagination]], and other [[object of the mind|objects of the mind]]. Hyperfocus on a certain subject can cause side-tracking away from  assigned or important tasks.

Hyperfocus may bear a relationship to the concept of [[Flow (psychology)|flow]].&lt;ref name="webb"&gt;{{citation |first1=James T. |last1=Webb |first2=Edward R. |last2=Amend |first3=Nadia E. |last3=Webb |first4=Jean |last4=Goerss |first5=Paul |last5=Beljan |first6=F.

In gifted children without ADD/ADHD, this rapt and productive attention state is described by Csikszentmihalyi (1990) as ‘flow.’ … What has been coined ‘hyperfocus’ in persons with ADD/ADHD seems to be a less medical-sounding description of perseveration. Thus the apparent ability to concentrate in certain limited situations does not exclude the diagnosis of ADD/ADHD. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some circumstances, both flow and hyperfocus can be an aid to achievement, but in other circumstances or situations, the same focus and behavior could be a liability, distracting from the task at hand. However, unlike hyperfocus, "flow" is often described in more glowing terms, suggesting they are not two sides of the same condition under contrasting circumstance or intellect.

== Confusion with perseveration (as a clinical symptom) ==

Hyperfocus may in some cases also be symptomatic of a [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] condition. In these cases, it is more commonly and accurately&lt;ref name="webb" /&gt; referred to as [[perseveration]]—an inability or impairment in switching tasks or activities ("[[Task switching (psychology)|set-shifting]]"),&lt;ref name="priory"&gt;[http://priory.com/gloss.htm#perseveration Priory psychiatric glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; or desisting from mental or physical response repetition (gestures, words, thoughts) despite absence or cessation of a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]],&lt;ref name="Dict Bio Psych"&gt;{{Citation | contribution=Perseveration | year=2001 | title=Dictionary of Biological Psychology | editor-last=Winn | editor-first=Philip | page=595 | isbn=9780415136068 | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UbL2MZ9xI7oC&amp;pg=PA595#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Helm-Estabrooks N |title=The problem of perseveration |journal=Semin Speech Lang |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=289–90 |year=2004 |pmid=15599818 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-837241 |url=http://www.thieme-connect.com/ejournals/html/ssl/doi/10.1055/s-2004-837241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PC def"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/2008/perseveration/ |website=Psych Central |title=Perseveration |last=Grinnell |first=Renée |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Di def"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/perseveration Dictionary.com definition]&lt;/ref&gt; and which is not excessive in terms of quantity but are apparently both functionless and involve a narrow range of behaviours, and are not better described as [[stereotypy]] (a highly repetitive [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] behaviour).

Conditions associated with perseveration include neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those considered to be on the [[autism spectrum]] (especially [[Asperger syndrome]]), and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD). In the latter, it is informally but probably incorrectly called "hyperfocus"&lt;ref name="webb" /&gt; and may be a coping mechanism or a symptom of self-regulation impairment—as well as people who are  [[twice exceptional|both intellectually gifted and suffer a learning disability]] who may have either or both of hyperfocus and perseverative behaviours.&lt;ref name="webb" /&gt;  Other conditions involving dysfunction or disregulation within the frontal lobe could also theoretically have similar effects.

It is typical for individuals with [[ADHD]] to say they 1), cannot focus on boring things and 2), can only focus on stimulating things,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodin|first1=Kate|title=Famous People with ADHD|url=http://www.parenting.com/gallery/famous-people-with-add-or-adhd?page=16|website=Parenting|publisher=Meredith Corporation|accessdate=2013-08-22|quote=David Neeleman, Founder of JetBlue Airways … reported in an interview with ADDitude magazine his ADHD prevents him from being detail-oriented and completing doing day-to-day tasks, saying, ‘I have an easier time planning a 20-aircraft fleet than I do paying the light bill.’}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''that focus is often extreme''. Thus, it is both a concentration deficit and over-concentration, or generically: "hyperfocus." More concisely, some types of ADHD are a difficulty in ''directing'' one's attention, (an [[executive function]] of the [[frontal lobe]]), ''not'' a lack of attention.&lt;ref&gt;2012 Burnett Lecture [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUQu-OPrzUc Video, Part 1 of 3, Keynote Speaker: Russell A.

M. &amp; Dodd, D. K. (1998).  GUTI: A measure of urgent task involvement among adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Psychological Reports, 82, 592-594.&lt;/ref&gt; found that adults with self-reported ADHD scored higher than normal adults on self-reported ability to hyperfocus on "urgent tasks" such as last-minute projects or preparations. Adults in the ADHD group were uniquely able to postpone eating, sleeping and other personal needs and stay absorbed in the "urgent task" for an extended time.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Clinical conditions unlikely to be confused with hyperfocus often involve repetition of thoughts or behaviors such as [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[PTSD|trauma]],&lt;ref name="differential"&gt;{{cite web |first=James Robert |last=Brasic |title=Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Differential Diagnoses |date=9 July 2012 |website=Medscape Reference |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some cases of [[traumatic brain injuries|traumatic brain injury]].&lt;ref name="priory" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1649">'''Inevitable disclosure''' is a [[legal doctrine]] through which an employer can claim [[trade secret]] to [[enjoin]] a former employee from working in a job that may result in the use of trade secrets without the need for proof or evidence.  

The inevitable-disclosure doctrine is one's means in demonstrating a revelation of trade secrets, and some have recently found some renewed judicial support. Where it is acceptable, the doctrine allows the court to find that a former employee would disclose proprietary information in their position with a new employer, even if there is no evidence of actual disclosure. Thus, allowing a company to make a critical showing, when it can't do so if required to come forward with evidence of misconduct. However, because it also rests on a prediction about a future harm, inevitable disclosure also is in tension with the general principle that injunctive relief will not be given to prevent a conjectural injury at any means.

'''Ingen Ryūki''' ({{CJKV|t=隱元隆琦|p=Yǐnyuán Lóngqí|j=隠元隆琦}}) (1592&amp;ndash;1673) was a poet, calligrapher, and [[bhikkhu|monk]] of [[Linji school|Linji Chan Buddhism]] from [[China]].&lt;ref name="nussbaum387"&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Ingen" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan encyclopedia,'' p. 387.|page=387}}; n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 |date=2012-05-24 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is most known for founding the [[Ōbaku]] school of [[Zen]] in [[Japan]].

==Biography==
Ingen was born on December 7, 1592, in [[Fuqing]], [[Fujian]], during China's [[Ming dynasty]]. Ingen's father disappeared when he was five.  At age 20, while searching for him, Ingen arrived at [[Mount Putuo]] off [[Zhejiang]] [[Provinces of China|province]], where he served tea to monks. At 28, after the death of his mother, he was ordained as a monk at his family temple - [[Wanfu Temple]], [[Mount Huangbo]], Fujian. Ingen's teachers there were [[Mi-yün Yüen-wu|Miyun Yuanwu]] and [[Feiyin Tongrong]]. In 1633 he received [[dharma transmission]] from the latter, and in 1637 served his first term as abbot. His second term as 33rd abbot of the temple began in 1646 and at this time he is credited with helping Mount Huangbo to develop into a thriving Buddhist centre.

In 1654, after repeated requests of [[Itsunen Shoyu]], he went to [[Nagasaki]], Japan with around 30 monks and artisans, including his disciple [[Muyan]]. He founded the Ōbaku [[schools of Buddhism|school of Zen]].&lt;ref name="nussbaum387"/&gt; He established the Ōbaku head temple [[Manpuku-ji]] at [[Uji, Kyoto]] in 1661.

On May 21, 1673 (''Enpō 1, 5th day of the 4th month''), he died at Mampuku-ji.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). {{Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|''Annales des empereurs du japon,'' p. 414.|page=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calligraphy==
Ingen was a skilled calligrapher, introducing the Ming style of calligraphy to Japan.&lt;ref name="nussbaum387"/&gt;  Along with his disciples [[Muyan]] and [[Sokuhi Nyoitsu]], he was one of the ''[[Ōbaku no Sanpitsu]]'' ("Three Brushes of Ōbaku"). He is known to have carried paintings by [[Chen Xian (painter)|Chen Xian]] with him to Japan.

==Selected work==
Ingen's published writings encompass 35 works in 46 publications in 4 languages and 226 library holdings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/identities/default.htm  WorldCat Identities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230150412/http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/identities/default.htm |date=2010-12-30 }}: [http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n80-133140  隱元 1592-1673]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Samuel Mbiti''' (born 30 November 1931) is a [[Kenya]]n-born Christian religious philosopher and writer. He is an ordained [[Anglican]] priest, and {{As of|2005|lc=on}} a [[canon (priest)|canon]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Kenya]], Mbiti studied in [[Uganda]] and the [[United States]], taking his doctorate in 1963 at the [[University of Cambridge]], UK. He taught religion and theology in [[Makerere University]], Uganda from 1964 to 1974 and was subsequently director of the [[World Council of Churches]]' [[ecumenism|Ecumenical]] Institute in [[Bogis-Bossey]], [[Switzerland]]. He has held visiting professorships at universities across the world and published extensively on philosophy, theology and African [[oral tradition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.heinemann.com/authors/587.aspx Heinemann] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010005952/http://books.heinemann.com/authors/587.aspx |date=2007-10-10 }} Author biography. Retrieved 23 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mbiti's seminal book, ''African Religions and Philosophy'' (1969), was the first work to challenge Christian assumption that  traditional African religious ideas were "demonic and anti-Christian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

His sympathetic treatment of traditional religions was based on massive field work. Mbiti is clear that his interpretation of these religions is from a firmly Christian perspective, and this aspect of his work has sometimes been severely criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Knowledge and its Limits''''', a 2000 book by philosopher [[Timothy Williamson]], argues that the concept of knowledge cannot be analyzed into a set of other concepts; instead, it is ''[[sui generis]]''. Thus, though knowledge requires justification, truth, and belief, the word "knowledge" can't be accurately regarded as simply shorthand for "justified true belief". It initiated a whole new approach to [[epistemology]], generally referred to as ''knowledge-first epistemology''.

Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Hollander received his primary and secondary education in [[Frankfurt]] and his B.A. (in [[Germanic philology]] with minors in comparative literature and English) and PhD (with a dissertation on prefixal -''s'' in Germanic) from [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref name=Gmc/&gt; He then spent two years traveling and studying in Scandinavia. On his return to the United States he taught German and Norwegian at the [[University of Michigan]] and then the [[University of Wisconsin]] and began to publish first translations and then scholarly articles. When [[World War I]] broke out, he lost his job like other faculty who taught German, and worked for the university library maintaining a newspaper clippings file until being hired by the University of Texas in 1920. He spent the remainder of his teaching career there, 47 years.&lt;ref name=Gmc/&gt; He became chairman of the Department of Germanic Studies in 1929 and after his retirement was Professor Emeritus.

Hollander's translation of [[Kierkegaard]] was the first into English. In his translations of Old Norse works, he placed high importance on preserving the style.&lt;ref name=memoriam/&gt; His complete works encompass 16 books and monographs, 22 translations, 88 articles, and 157 reviews.&lt;ref name=memoriam/&gt;

Hollander married Jean Wright Fisher in June 1912; they had three children. He played violin in both the University of Texas Symphony Orchestra and the [[Austin Symphony Orchestra]], and participated in founding both. He was also a gardener and beekeeper. He was politically liberal and contributed to ''[[The Nation]]'' and volunteered at the Austin Human Rights Center helping students master English.&lt;ref name=memoriam/&gt; He died on his way home from the University of Texas campus on October 19, 1972.

Topics in [[Bioethics]] may be the subject of study within many disciplines in the [[Humanities]], [[Law degree|Law]], the [[Social science]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and [[Health sciences]], and not exclusively within dedicated bioethics programs. However, here are listed only those programs with formal bioethics designations or concentrations.

'''Manuel Dimech''' (25 December 1860, [[Valletta]] – 17 April 1921, [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]) was the pre-eminent social reformer in pre-independence [[Malta]], a philosopher, a journalist, and a writer of novels and poetry.

Born and brought up in extreme poverty and illiteracy, Dimech returned time and time again to the prisons, mostly on theft charges. At seventeen years of age he even committed murder. In the prisons, however, he studied hard and became skilful in letters and various arts. When finally set in liberty, he engaged himself in an energetic and enterprising public life by teaching and publishing. He aimed at an overall transformation of society in which the poor and abject would be given a rightful place as citizens of a free republic. Having incurred the wrath of the dominant political forces and the privileged classes, Dimech was permanently exiled from the island and was buried in [[Egypt]] in an unmarked grave.

==Biography==
The main literary source for Dimech's biography is Mark Montebello's extensive work ''Dimech'', published in 2004 (PEG, Malta; vol. 1 of the 2nd edition published in 2013 by Miller Distributors, Malta). Though it is in Maltese, a fully documented biography in English is available as ''The Amazing Story of Manuel Dimech'' (Dom Communications, Malta 2014) and in ''Aphorisms: Wisdom of a Philosopher in Exile'' (SKS, Malta 2012).

[[File:Dimech birth place.jpg|thumb|The place where Manuel Dimech was born on 25 December 1860 in St. John's Street, Valletta, Malta.]]

===Birth and formation===
Manuel Dimech was born on [[Christmas Day]] (December 25), 1860, at St John Street, [[Valletta]], [[Malta]], and baptised at the church of St Paul Shipwreck, [[Valletta]].&lt;ref&gt;St Paul’s Parish, Valletta, ''Baptism Registers'', Vol. XXII, f. 423.&lt;/ref&gt; His family was poor and lived in a single room that was part of a common tenement house with over sixty people.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', ''Status Animarum'', 1860, no page numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; His ancestors on his father's side were genuine artistic sculptors, though up till Dimech's birth his family had fallen on difficult times. During his childhood, Dimech's family moved residence twice, leaving [[Valletta]] for [[Qormi]] (today [[Santa Venera]]),&lt;ref&gt;Public Registry, Valletta, ''Birth Registers'', nru. 1527/1870.&lt;/ref&gt; and then moving to [[Msida]].&lt;ref&gt;St George Parish, Qormi, ''Baptism Registers'', Vol. G, f. 161v.&lt;/ref&gt; His father tried hard to make ends meet, but his weak health prevented any success in this endeavour. He died at the young age of only 37, leaving his widow to care for ten young children.&lt;ref&gt;St Publius Parish, Floriana, ''Death Registers at the Central Public Hospital'' (Floriana), Vol. A, f. 163; and URP, Death Registers, no. 1507/1874.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison experience===
Just a fortnight after his father's death the 13-year-old Dimech committed his first recorded crime of petty theft.&lt;ref&gt;Banca Giuratale, Mdina, ''Atti d’Istruzione'', 1874, Vol. IV, Part 54, f. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a street urchin with no education, guidance or direction. For his first crime he was sent two days in a lockup.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Malta, Rabat, ''Blue Book'', 1874, Sec. AB, Parts 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt; This experience did not stop him from delving deeper into a life of crime. Subsequently, he was to be sent nine more times to prison, sometimes for very serious crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', ''Admissions and Discharges'', CPP 01, November 1874, f. 3; May 1876, f. 385; December 1876, f. 68; January 1877, f. 301; May 1877, f. 116; October 1877, f. 368; November 1877, f. 650; April 1878, f. 5v.&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly it was for theft or burglary, but in 1878, when he was 17 years old, he committed involuntary murder, and was imprisoned for more than twelve years.&lt;ref&gt;Banca Giuratale, Mdina, ''Procedure e Sentenze'', 1878, Section XXIII, ff. 161-2.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, then, he was found guilty of forging counterfeit money (though he only traded it), and was imprisoned for a further seven years.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', Section XXXVI, f. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; He was definitely released from prison in 1897 at the age of 36.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Malta, Rabat, CSG 01, ''Prisons'' 17105/97.&lt;/ref&gt; In all he had spent some twenty years of incarceration.

===Education===
While in prison Dimech began to learn how to read and write.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', ''Atti d’Istruzione'', 1878, Vol. II, Part 1, f. 5v.&lt;/ref&gt; This was in 1877, when he was 17 years old. With all the time of the world on his hands he quickly became an avid reader, absorbing all kinds of stuff: [[literature]], [[grammar]], [[politics]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[religion]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', CSG 01, ''Prisons'' 4453/95.&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered he had a special penchant for languages, and in prison he learnt the ins and outs of [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] to perfection. Later he would make a living teaching these languages. He had a good brain and a fruitful mind. His keen interest in politics was not committed to petty squabbles or parochial issues, but burrowed deep into the structural causes of poverty and oppression. All of this would serve him well in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', ''Prisons'' 9394/86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terror in prison===
In prison Dimech had another kind of formation. During his last stint in prison between 1890 and 1897,&lt;ref&gt;Banca Giuratale, Mdina, ''Procedure e Sentenze'', 1891, Section XXXVI, f. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; a certain Marquis Giorgio Barbaro was appointed Commissioner of Prison. This man was a psychopath who made the life of prisoners, vulnerable and defenceless as they were, a hell on earth. He tortured, murdered, persecuted and tormented prisoners ceaselessly.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Dimech, ''The Flag of the Maltese'', May 13, 1899, 4b; November 17, 1900, 4a; January 15, 1898, 1c; July 8, 1899, 4a; National Archives of Malta, Rabat, CSG 01, ''Prisons'' 21463/98, ''Evidence given before the Commission Appointed by Government Letter No. 1467 of the 3rd May 1898'', ff. 61 and 63; and Dimech, ''The Flag of the Maltese'', January 8, 1898, 2b; March 26, 1898, 2a; April 30, 1898, 1; May 21, 1898, 4a; April 1, 1899, 2b; National Archives of Malta, Rabat, CSG 01, ''Prisons'' 21463/98, ''Evidence given before the Commission Appointed by Government Letter No. 1467 of the 3rd May 1898'', f. 35; Dimech, ''The Flag of the Maltese'', August 26, 1899, 4a; May 27, 1899, 4b; February 26, 1898, 4a; May 7, 1898, 1a-c; and July 6, 1901, 2c.&lt;/ref&gt; He also perjured his way into sending at least two prisoners to the gallows for crimes they had not committed.&lt;ref&gt;Dimech, ''The Flag of the Maltese'', April 28, 1900, 4b; and May 12, 1900, 4a; and National Archives of Malta, Rabat, ''Superintendent’s Order Book'', Memo Nru. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Dimech saw all this and lived through it with growing agony.&lt;ref&gt;Dimech, ''The Flag of the Maltese'', September 30, 1899, 3b; National Archives of Malta, Rabat, ''Atti d’Istruzione'', 1891, Vol. IV, Parti 59, f. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience, together with the reading he was doing, moulded him into a daring, powerful and intrepid personality.

===Public figure===
Once out of prison in 1897,&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Malta, Rabat, CSG 01, ''Prisons'' 17105/97.&lt;/ref&gt; Dimech embarked on an outstanding public career that brought him fame, though not immediate success. From the start of 1898 he issued a weekly in [[Maltese language|Maltese]] that was to serve him as his mouthpiece for many years to come. He called it ''Il-Bandiera tal-Maltin'' (The Flag of the Maltese; pronounced ''ilbaandeera taal maaltin'').&lt;ref&gt;Dimech, ''The Flag of the Maltese'', 8 January 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Through it he explored, albeit with the language and prose of the times, the structures of oppression in a country that had been a [[colony]] of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] since 1800, and in the clutches of the [[Catholic Church]] since time immemorial. Furthermore, Dimech proposed the way forward. He advocated the education of the masses, and audaciously specified how [[Malta]] could one day be an economically self-sufficient independent republic.

===Philosophy===
Dimech adhered to a philosophy that he called ‘of action’, a position very close, though directly unrelated, to the contemporaneous [[Pragmatism]] of [[United States|America]]. He came at this position through his acquaintance with the [[philosophy]] of [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and other [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Empiricists]] and philosophers of [[Utilitarianism]]. He claimed that actions can be considered right or wrong, and value judgments can be rightly gauged, according to whether they perform well when applied to practice. Actions, he maintained, proceed from the ''power'' that knowledge possesses ''from itself''. Furthermore, actions are aimed at acquiring happiness, first, for the individual, and, simultaneously, for the whole community of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Montebello, ''Dimech'', vol. 1, 2013, 231-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Il-Bandiera tal-Maltin No. 1 (8 January 1898).JPG|thumb|left|First issue of Dimech's weekly ''Il-Bandiera tal-Maltin'' (The Flag of the Maltese) - 8 January 1898]]

===Publications===
During his lifetime Dimech issued various publications. The 462 editions of ''Il-Bandiera tal-Maltin'' are perhaps the foremost. But others are also interesting. Amongst these one can find other newspapers in foreign languages (of short duration), two novels, grammar books (in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and Maltese), and pamphlets. Unfortunately, books of poetry have not survived. Dimech's main objective with these publications was to form a political class from amongst the people, especially young men and women who had not the possibility of acquiring an education otherwise. Dimech was enamored of the [[Maltese language]], and saw it as an efficacious tool of emancipation.

===Foreign experience===
Dimech had travelled to [[Tunis]] in 1890 for expediency reasons.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Malta, Rabat, CSG 01, Auditor General 2924/90; ''Customs Department Records'', L103.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1903 he visited [[Montenegro]] (for almost three weeks)&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Malta, Rabat, Customs Department Records, L260, K850.&lt;/ref&gt; to study at close range the social and political situation there. He enhanced this experience by travelling twice to the north of [[Italy]] (especially [[Genoa]], [[Milan]] and [[Turin]]), where, in all, he spent almost four years.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., L293, K929, L312, K1019.&lt;/ref&gt; There Dimech became particularly acquainted to workers’ movements and the trade unions. He was also very interested in the state-church relationship that prevailed in [[Italy]] during that fascinating time. Understandably, he came back to [[Malta]] fired up and all ready to bring about the social changes he had been mulling over for many years.

===Main political programme===
It is indisputable that Dimech wanted, and worked for, an overhaul of the social system. His main aim was to pull the carpet from under the structures of oppression, whether they were maintained by the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial government, the [[Catholic Church]], the privileged class, the landed gentry, or whoever. His strategy was to begin with the political education of a new grass-root group of people, and subsequently permeate the illiterate, underprivileged and destitute masses. His ultimate aims were to make [[Malta]] an industrialised country that could be economically self-reliant and, eventually, be worthy of independence.

===Popular organiser===
Definitely back to [[Malta]] from [[Italy]] in 1911, Dimech founded what he called ''Ix-Xirka ta' l-Imdawlin'' (The League of the Enlightened; pronounced ''ishirka taal imdaaulin'').&lt;ref&gt;Dimech, ''The Flag of the Maltese'', June 3, 1911, 1a.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a sort of union in the modern understanding of the word, in the sense that it was a social club, an organisation militating for workers’ rights, a school of [[adult education]], and a political party all in one. Through this league Dimech hoped to have a say, and transformative influence, in the political, and then the social, and maybe also the religious, fields. Young idealists and people craving for change flocked to him, and not only from the lower class but also from the middle and higher classes. Dimech's political “revolution” had begun.

===Excommunicated===
But immediately Dimech was held in his tracks. The then mighty Catholic Church pounced on him, and first condemned ''Il-Bandiera tal-Maltin'' and ''Ix-Xirka ta' l-Imdawlin'',&lt;ref&gt;The Bishop’s Archives, Floriana, ''Corrispondenza Pace'', 1911-12, Vol. XV, doc. 161, #1.&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly afterward excommunicated Dimech himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid. '', ''Editti di Monsignor Pietro Pace'', Vol. 35, f. 88, ''ad term''.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this was an overwhelmingly devastating blow in all respects in [[Malta]] of the 1910s, Dimech was undaunted. He fought back with the little freedom of movement and action that was left to him, and stalwartly stood his ground. For a whole year, between 1911 and 1912, he and his family were systematically and pitilessly persecuted by the Church,&lt;ref&gt;''The Cross'' (''Is Salib''), Malta, November 18, 1911, 2b; ''Malta is still Ours'' (''Malta ghada Taghna''), Malta, November 4, 1911, 4a; ''Ibid.'', October 21, 1911, 3c; October 28, 1911, 5a-c; November 4, 1911, 1a-2b; and November 11, 1911, 1b-2a; ''The Friend'' (''Il Habib''), Malta, May 23, 1912, 3ab; ''Malta'', November 8, 1911, 2ef; ''Ibid.'', February 14, 1912, 2e-3a; ''The Cross'', October 28, 1911, 3bc; November 4, 1911, 3a; ''Malta is still Ours'', October 28, 1911, 3c; December 30, 1911, 3a.&lt;/ref&gt; but nothing could break his back. Then, obliquely admitting defeat, the Church called a truce.&lt;ref&gt;The Bishop’s Archives, Floriana, ''Atti Civili 1912'', f. 134, doc. 4, f. 134; doc. 177A.&lt;/ref&gt; Dimech had won against all odds, and immediately re-established his former organization with the name ''Ix-Xirka tal-Maltin'' (The League of the Maltese; pronounced ''ishirka tal maltin'').

===Considered dangerous===
But the Catholic Church was not the only institution disgruntled with Dimech. The [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial government was unhappy with his widespread and growing influence amongst the workers at the Royal shipyards. Indeed, the great majority of Dimech's foot soldiers came from there, and this threatened to precariously disrupt the use of [[Malta]] as one of His Majesty's major [[Mediterranean]] naval base. Slowly but surely, and perhaps not without a push or two from the authorities of the Catholic Church, the powers to be began to close upon this little man who was considered dangerous enough to be destroyed.

[[File:S.S. Stura.jpg|thumb|Italian S.S. Stura on which Dimech was exiled]]

===Deportation and imprisonment===
Just over a year after Dimech re-launched his ''Xirka tal-Maltin'', he was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives of Malta, Rabat, ''Political'' 3688/14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[World War I]] had just begun, and [[Malta]]’s [[United Kingdom|British]] governor accepted the accusation that Dimech was a spy of [[Germany]] (then at war with [[United Kingdom|Britain]]), and surreptitiously deported him to the island to [[Sicily]], in [[Italy]] (as yet a neutral country in the war).&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', ''Political'' 3767/14, Red 19; Libr. 1511, f. 1; ''Political'' 3688/14.&lt;/ref&gt; There he was shortly arrested again,&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., ''LG Papers'' M 608/15, Dimech’s petition.&lt;/ref&gt; and asked to leave to a country, save [[Malta]], of his own choice. Dimech chose [[Egypt]], then a British [[protectorate]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt; Again, shortly afterwards, he was arrested once more, this time for good.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., ''LG Papers'' M 608/15, Dimech’s petition; and Gerald Azzopardi Archive, Dimech’s letter to Hugh McBain, March 28, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; For the remaining days of his life, for seven long and miserable years, Dimech lived in prisons or concentration camps either at [[Alexandria]] or [[Cairo]].

===Exile===
At some unspecified time the [[United Kingdom|British]] began to consider Dimech as a “prisoner of war”.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''., ''Despatch''10/17 (Red 11).&lt;/ref&gt; However, when [[World War I]] came to an end in 1918, he was not released. Technically and actually, Dimech then became an exile, and he remained so until the end of his days. Various pleas for his return to [[Malta]] were refused by the British colonial government in Malta, even when these were repeatedly made by the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]], [[Edmund Allenby]], and later by the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Winston Churchill]].

===Death===
At the end of 1918 Dimech was transferred to a concentration camp at Sidi Bishr in [[Alexandria]]. Dire prison conditions caused his health to deteriorate fast. In November 1920, after becoming half-paralyzed by [[apoplexy]], he was transferred to [[Victoria College, Alexandria]], at Sidi Bishr itself, a college that had been transformed into a hospital due to war exigencies.&lt;ref&gt;Sahar Hamouda and Colin Clement, eds., ''Victoria College: A History Revealed'', The American University in Cairo Press, Cairo, Egypt, 2002, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; But by then Dimech was doomed. He died forlorn and alone on April 17, 1921,&lt;ref&gt;Public Registry Office, Kew, Richmond, FO 371/6291/4729, 208, ''Eastern'' 260 (E. 4792/205/16).&lt;/ref&gt; and was unceremoniously buried in the sand grounds of [[Victoria College, Alexandria]], itself. His grave was unmarked, and all attempts to locate it have been futile.

==The Dimechians==
A small group of young followers of Dimech continued to be somewhat active in [[Malta]] well after his deportation in 1914. They organized [[Malta]]’s first recorded strike at the Royal shipyards in 1920, and were significantly amongst the rioters against the British colonial government on 7 June 1919, riots which led to the granting of [[Malta]]’s first self-government. They were harassed and persecuted harshly by the colonial government, especially in 1914 and 1933, so much so that to be a Dimechian became quickly tantamount to public disgrace. By time, the few faithful Dimechians died out, and Dimech himself was forgotten.

==Posthumous recognition==
[[File:Estatua de Manwel Dimech.jpg|thumb|Monument to Manwel Dimech at Castille Square, Valletta]]
Dimech was re-introduced to the public by Gerald Azzopardi (1910–1993) in the 1960s, and later, in the 1970s, he was given more academic validity by [[Henry Frendo]]. This led to a renewed interest in Dimech's life. Also in the 1970s, the [[socialist]] Prime Minister, [[Dom Mintoff]], transformed Dimech into a sort of [[socialist]] icon, even though Dimech himself would have been ill at ease with such a recognition. However, Dimech's fame was finally set. A small run of one Maltese pound coins were produced engraved with his name and likeness in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ngccoin.com/poplookup/world-coin-prices.aspx?category=41095&amp;worldcoinid=118368&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Times of Malta'', 10 October 1972, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Times of Malta, 31 January 1973, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; A monument to him was erected in 1976 in front of the Prime Minister's office in [[Valletta]], at one of [[Malta]]'s main squares.&lt;ref&gt;Prime Minister Dom Mintoff announced the monument on October 11, 1974; ''Times of Malta'', Oct. 12, 1974, p.16. The statue was removed on March 10, 2015, due to a revamp being given to the square.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 Dr Mark Montebello placed the study and appreciation of Dimech on a new and unprecedented standing with a master biographical work called simply ''Dimech'' (PEG, Malta), which started to behold Dimech's personality in a more balanced and objective way.

On October 14, 2012, the discovery of new Dimech manuscripts was announced dating from the last three years of his exile.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maltastar.com/dart/20121014-new-manuscripts-of-manwel-dimech-discovered{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.maltatoday.com.mt/magazinedetails/magazine/books/Wisdom-in-exile-Mark-Montebello-and-Francis-Galea-20121031 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016063742/http://m.maltatoday.com.mt/magazinedetails/magazine/books/Wisdom-in-exile-Mark-Montebello-and-Francis-Galea-20121031 |archivedate=2013-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscripts contain an extensive work in English made up of thousands of aphorisms, and some fables, epitaphs and poems. The discovery was made in two phases, in 2002 and 2009. Dimech's work was published in 2012 by Sensiela Kotba Socjalisti, SKS, as ''Aphorisms: Wisdom of a philosopher in exile''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20121015/local/Dimech-scribblings-are-now-a-book-of-aphorisms.441123&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than two years later, in June 2014, [[Henry Frendo]] published yet other hitherto unknown manuscripts belonging to Dimech dating from the early 1880s (when Dimech was still in prison). The publication, ''Dimech's Lost Prison Poems'' (Midsea Books),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midseabooks.com/publications_detail.aspx?pid=13661#.U6GwyvkbXJ5&lt;/ref&gt; contains poems by Dimech (some of which signed and dated in his own hand), and letters received by Dimech while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;http://issuu.com/midseabooks/docs/dimechlostpoems/1?e=12107638%2F8199379&lt;/ref&gt;

===National recognition===

As a sign of national recognition, on November 10, 2012, the [[President of Malta]], Dr [[George Abela]], unveiled in St John Street, [[Valletta]], a commemorative plaque marking the birthplace of Dimech.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2012-11-13/news/dimech-belongs-to-no-political-party-president-380895235/&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, on October 13, 2013, the [[Prime Minister of Malta]], Dr [[Joseph Muscat]], unveiled in [[Qormi]] another commemorative plaque marking the spot were, in 1912, Dimech had been stoned by a mob.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.di-ve.com/news/prime-minister-commemorates-manuel-dimech%E2%80%99s-stoning&lt;/ref&gt; On September 5, 2014, exactly 100 years to the day since the beginning of Dimech's exile, the [[President of Malta]], [[Marie Louise Coleiro Preca]], unveiled, close to the Customs house at Valletta (from where Dimech was sent to his exile), yet another commemorative plaque marking the event.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-09-06/news/commemoration-marking-100-yearsfrom-manuel-dimechs-exile-6476791808/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20140921/social/Centenary-commemoration-marks-Manwel-Dimech-s-exile.536563&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievement==
Dimech evocatively and compellingly advocated the emancipation of the masses. His assault on the entrenched structures of oppression in [[Malta]] was extraordinary, outstanding and unmatched by anything that had gone before. Dimech was not a nationalist, an anti-colonialist or a socialist in any way we would understand the terms today. He was, first and foremost, an enemy of any kind of domination, coercion, cruelty, tyranny, repression and subjugation. If this made him a nationalist, an anti-colonialist or some kind of socialist, it was surely only in an indirect and oblique way. Dimech did not achieve in his lifetime what he set out to accomplish. He was violently and unjustly truncated. Most of the policies he advocated were implemented some half a century after his death by [[Dom Mintoff]] in the 1970s.

'''''Mare Liberum''''' (or '''''The Freedom of the Seas''''') is a book in [[Latin]] on [[public international law|international law]] written by the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[jurist]] and [[philosopher]] [[Hugo Grotius]], first published in 1609. In ''The Free Sea'', Grotius formulated the new principle that the sea was international territory and all nations were free to use it for seafaring trade. The disputation was directed towards the Portuguese [[Mare clausum|Mare clausum policy]] and their claim of monopoly on the [[Indies|East Indian]] Trade. Grotius wrote the treatise while being a counsel to the [[Dutch East India Company]] over the seizing of the [[Santa Catarina (ship)|Santa Catarina Portuguese carrack]] issue.&lt;ref&gt;At dawn of February 25, 1603 three ships of the Dutch East India Company (V.O.C) seized [[Santa Catarina (ship)]], a Portuguese merchant carrack. It was such a rich prize that its sale proceeds doubled the capital of the V.O.C. The legality of keeping the prize was questionable under Dutch statute and the Portuguese demanded the return of their cargo. The scandal led to a public judicial hearing and a wider campaign to sway public (and international) opinion. As a result [[Hugo Grotius]] was called, providing a suitable ideological justification for the Dutch breaking up trade monopolies through its formidable naval power.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Brown Scott, "Introductory note". In: Hugo Grotius (1916) ''The Freedom of the Seas'', New York: [[Oxford University Press]], p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mierevelt grotius 1608.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A 1608 portrait of Grotius at age 25 by [[Michiel Jansz van Mierevelt]]]]

Grotius' argument was that the sea was free to all, and that nobody had the right to deny others access to it. In chapter I, he laid out his objective, which was to demonstrate "briefly and clearly that the Dutch [...] have the right to sail to the East Indies", and, also, "to engage in trade with the people there". He then went on to describe how he based his argument on what he called the "most specific and unimpeachable axiom of the Law of Nations, called a primary rule or first principle, the spirit of which is self-evident and immutable", namely that: "Every nation is free to travel to every other nation, and to trade with it."&lt;ref&gt;Grotius, ''The Freedom of the Seas'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; From this premise, Grotius argued that this self-evident and immutable right to travel and to trade required (1) a right of innocent passage over land, and (2) a similar right of [[innocent passage|innocent passage at sea]]. The sea, however, was more like air than land, and was, as opposed to land, ''common property of all'':

{{quote|The air belongs to this class of things for two reasons. First, it is not susceptible of occupation; and second its common use is destined for all men. For the same reasons the sea is common to all, because it is so limitless that it cannot become a possession of any one, and because it is adapted for the use of all, whether we consider it from the point of view of navigation or of fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;Grotius, ''The Freedom of the Seas'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Mare Liberum'' was published by [[House of Elzevir|Elzevier]] in the spring of 1609. It has been translated into English twice. The first translation was by [[Richard Hakluyt]], and was completed some time between the publication of ''Mare Liberum'' in 1609 and Hakluyt's death in 1616.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Armitage (historian)|David Armitage]], "Introduction". In: Hugo Grotius (2004) ''The Free Sea'', Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, pp. xxii–xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hakluyt's translation was only  published for the first time in 2004 under the title ''The Free Sea'' as part of Liberty Fund's "Natural Law and Enlightenment Classics" series. The second translation was by Ralph Van Deman Magoffin, associate professor of Greek and Roman History at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. This translation was a part of a debate on free shipping during the [[World War I|First World War]],&lt;ref&gt;See [[Freedom of the seas]].&lt;/ref&gt; and was published by the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] and [[Oxford University Press]] in 1916 as ''The Freedom of the Seas, Or, The Right Which Belongs to the Dutch to Take Part in the East Indian Trade''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12242">'''Muhammad Othman Elkhosht (al-khasht)''' (born 1964) ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|محمد عثمان الخشت}}) is a professor of philosophy of religion and contemporary philosophy at Faculty of Arts, [[Cairo University]], where he is also a cultural advisor. He is a leading authority on modern [[Islam]], and a member of the Association for Intercultural Philosophy, which encourages a dialogue among philosophers from all over the world.

==Scientific life==
Elkhosht is an Arab thinker and an encyclopaedia of knowledge; he has delved into both Islamic heritage and Western thought. His writings are characterized by combining the rational approach and his faith background.

His writings are references to fundamentals of religion, modern and contemporary doctrines, and political science, in a sense that has to do with civil society and its role, the global state and the nation state.

Some of Elkhosht’s writings are taught at several universities with regard to the various disciplines of religion: Fundamentals of Religion, Study of Hadith, Sharia (Islamic Law), and Comparative Religion. He has also written many books on Islamic sects as well as social life. Elkhosht’s writings, marked by moderation and rationality, reveal his thorough study of the humanities and legal sciences. His style is clear and logical. He also acts as a cultural adviser to Cairo University.

Elkhosht has rewritten the Studies of Hadith in a modern way and re-interpreted the position of Sharia (Islamic Law) on women's issues since the eighties of the twentieth century, with regard to women’s right to take positions in the judiciary, the fatwa (authoritative ruling on a religious issue), taking the stand in court of law, equality between men and women in political and civil rights, etc. He has an upright stance on issues that have to do with the state, civil society, freedom of expression, and democracy. He has fought corruption and extremism in many of his books and articles, such as "Civil Society and the State," and "Ethics and the Conducts of Progress". Elkhosht has also established philosophical tolerance in his books "Common Minimum" and "Rationality and Intolerance" in which he criticizes those closed, lifeless and dogmatic doctrines.

On the other hand, M. O. Elkhosht’s works offer a new vision of the history of western philosophy that goes beyond the traditional conflict, since the beginning of modern times, between rationality and emotions, idealism and realism, formalism and materialism. Moreover, some other messages are generated from Elkhosht’s works to combine the thoughts of Descartes and Bacon, Leibniz and Locke before Kant and Hume, and after Hegel and Marx. He has criticized Descartes’ theological undertones and unravelled his counterfeit rationality. Elkhosht’s also criticized Leibniz’s resort to theology, Hegel’s absolutism, and Hume’s sensual world and scepticism.

Furthermore, Elkhosht, in his book "The Major Faiths”, has called for spiritual rationality, as a methodology, and, at the same time, a vision for the universe and life. He has managed to distinguish between rational and irrational elements of religions, depending on the rational critical approach, in his book "The Reasonable and the Unreasonable in Religions". There are references to his writings in Western studies and websites which have many quotations from them. His name is mentioned in those studies as follows: "Muhammad Othman Al-Khasht", "Muhammad Al-Khasht", or "Alkhasht".

In that pre-university stage, Elkhosht received prizes in many research and Qur'an competitions and at the level of the Arab Republic of Egypt. As a university student, Elkhosht had many books and research works published. His first book was published while he was still a freshman. And then his writings kept coming and were published by major Egyptian and Lebanese publishing houses while he was still a university student: his first book on the Qur'an was published while he was a freshman. Later, major Lebanese publishing houses published his writings while he was still a student, such as Dar Alkitab Alarabi. Whoever read his writings at that time would believe that Elkhosht was such an old, experienced scholar.

Some leading magazines in Egypt and the Arab world have published and reviewed his works. Elkhosht always topped his classes during his college years.

==el-Khosht in the eyes of others==
Some thinkers and scholars’ views on M. O. Elkhosht :
* - The Egyptian philosopher Prof. Hassan Hanafi, in his introduction to his book "Mind and Metaphysics", published by Dar Al-Tanweer in Beirut, described Elkhosht saying, “It is as if the soul of Al-Farabi is back again in Muhammad Osman Elkhosht who belongs to a comprehensive civilization that unites instead of stirring sources of differences. It is also as if Elkhosht is heading for a second reconciliation between Salafism and secularism, in an attempt to bring that bloodshed between brothers, in modern time, to a halt.”
* - When Dr. Yasin Abdel Ghaffar, the greatest hepatologist in the Arab world, listened to the twenty-one year old’s Friday sermon (On the Qur'an and Progress), he said: “There is no doubt that Muhammad Osman Elkhosht is a new modern religious scholar who speaks a new language and tackles modern topics with clear rationality. Therefore, he is not like other sheikhs, he is a rational thinker who believes in religion.”
* - Sheikh ‘Amer Osman said: “He recites the Qur’an in an extremely accurate way.”
* - Sheikh Mahmoud Khalil Al-Hosary commended Elkhosht’s excellent articulation of the sounds of the Qur'an.
* - Prof. Yahya Howaidy, former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Islamic thinker, said: “Muhammad Osman Elkhosht is a new model of philosopher who has managed to offer a new vision of the history of philosophy that has changed the traditional view of modern and contemporary philosophy.”
* - The great professor of philosophy Prof. Murad Wahba Said, “Despite my difference with Prof. Mohamed Osman Elkhosht in ideology, I see that his writings are not research works in philosophy, but they are original, philosophical texts based on genuine creativity.”
* - Prof. Sobhi Saleh, a scientific author and professor of sciences at the University of Alexandria, said, “He has a bright mind.”
* - The renowned researcher Mr. Abdul Qadir Ata said: “He is one of the best researchers and is full of ideas.”
* - Abu Abdul Malik Alsakandari, a Salafi scholar, said: “Prof. Muhammad Osman Elkhosht is a great researcher and scholar.”
* - Sheikh Ibrahim Atwa Awad, a researcher, said: "Muhammad Osman Elkhosht is a researcher and scrutinizer who goes deeply into the heritage."

==Legacy &amp; Literature==
M. O. Elkhosht has dozens of books, research papers, and translations. He has also supervised many theses and helped many of his students who are members of the teaching staff of the Egyptian and Arab universities. Elkhosht is an arbiter in the Professor Promotion committees in many Arab universities.

Some of his contributions to the academic field are: 
* 23 research papers in Arabic and English, published regionally and internationally.
* 57 books published by the major publishing houses, locally and regionally.
* Supervising tens of Master and PhD theses and scientific research papers in the philosophy of religion and philosophy of politics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15836">'''Neopragmatism''', sometimes called '''post-Deweyan pragmatism''',&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/pragmati/ Pragmatism – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; '''linguistic pragmatism''',&lt;ref&gt;Elias Khalil (ed.), ''Dewey, Pragmatism and Economic Methodology'', Routledge, 2004, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''analytic pragmatism''',&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Kuenzle, ''Refurbishing Epistemology: A Meta-Epistemological Framework'', Walter de Gruyter, 2017, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; is the philosophical tradition that infers that the meaning of words is a function of how they are used, rather than the meaning of what people intend for them to describe.

The ''Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy'' (2004) defines "neo-pragmatism" as "A [[postmodernism|postmodern]] version of pragmatism developed by the American philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] and drawing inspiration from authors such as [[John Dewey]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Wilfrid Sellars]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], and [[Jacques Derrida]]".  It's a contemporary term for a philosophy which reintroduces many concepts from [[pragmatism]]. While traditional pragmatism focuses on experience, Rorty centers on [[literary theory|language]]. The self is regarded as a "centerless web of beliefs and desires". 

It repudiates the notions of universal truth, epistemological foundationalism, representationalism, and epistemic objectivity. It is a nominalist approach that denies that [[natural kind]]s and linguistic entities have substantive ontological implications. Rorty denies that the subject-matter of the human sciences can be studied in the same ways as we study the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnin &amp; Yu, ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy'', 2007, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has been associated with a variety of other thinkers including [[Hilary Putnam]],&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; [[W. V. O. Quine]],&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]],&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malpas, Jeff, "Donald Davidson", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/davidson/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; though none of these figures have called themselves "neopragmatists". The following contemporary philosophers are also often considered to be neopragmatists: [[Nicholas Rescher]] (a proponent of [[methodological pragmatism]] and '''pragmatic idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Susan Haack]], [[Robert Brandom]], and [[Cornel West]].&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt; 

== Background ==

=== "Anglo-analytic" influences ===
Neopragmatists, particularly Rorty and Putnam, draw on the ideas of classical pragmatists such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]]. Putnam, in ''Words and Life'' (1994) enumerates the ideas in the classical pragmatist tradition, which newer pragmatists find most compelling. To paraphrase Putnam:
#Complete skepticism (the notion that a belief in philosophical skepticism requires just as much justification  as other beliefs);
#[[Fallibilism]] (the view that there are no metaphysical guarantees against the need to revise a belief);
#Antidualism about [[Fact–value distinction|"facts" and "values"]];
#That practice, properly construed, is primary in philosophy. (WL 152)

Neopragmatism is distinguished from classical [[pragmatism]] (the pragmatism of James, Dewey, Pierce, and Mead) primarily due to the influence of the [[linguistic turn]] in philosophy that occurred in the early and mid-twentieth century. The linguistic turn in philosophy reduced talk of mind, ideas, and the world to language and the world. Philosophers stopped talking about the ideas or concepts one may have present in one's mind and started talking about the "mental language" and terms used to employ these concepts. In the early twentieth century philosophers of language (e.g. A.J. Ayer, Bertrand Russell, G.E. Moore) thought that analyzing language would bring about the arrival of meaning, objectivity, and ultimately, truth concerning external reality. In this tradition, it was thought that truth was obtained when linguistic terms stood in a proper correspondence relation to non-linguistic objects (this can be called "representationalism"). The thought was that in order for a statement or proposition to be true it must give facts which correspond to what is actually present in reality. This is called the correspondence theory of truth and is to be distinguished from a neo-pragmatic conception of truth.

There were many philosophical inquiries during the mid-twentieth century which began to undermine the legitimacy of the methodology of the early Anglo-analytic philosophers of language. W.V.O. Quine in ''Word and Object'',&lt;ref name="Quine 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Quine|first=Willard Van Orman|title=Word and Object|year=2013|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally published in 1960, attacked the notion of our concepts having any strong correspondence to reality. Quine argued for ontological relativity which attacked the idea that language could ever describe or paint a purely non-subjective picture of reality. More specifically, ontological relativity is the thesis that states that the things we believe to exist in the world are wholly dependent on our subjective, "mental languages". A 'mental language' is simply the way words which denote concepts in our minds are mapped to objects in the world.

Quine's argument for ontological relativity is roughly as follows:
# All ideas and perceptions concerning reality are given to our minds in terms of our own mental language.
# Mental languages specify how objects in the world are to be constructed from our sense data.
# Different mental languages will specify different ontologies (different objects existing in the world).
# There is no way to perfectly translate between two different mental languages: there will always be several, consistent ways in which the terms in each language can be mapped onto the other.
# Reality apart from our perceptions of it can be thought of as constituting a true, object language, that is, the language which specifies how things ''actually are''.
# There is no difference in translating between two mental languages as translating between the object language of reality and one's own mental language.
# Therefore, just as there is no objective way of translating between two mental languages (no one-to-one mapping of terms in one to terms in the other) there is no way of objectively translating (or fitting) the true, object language of reality into our own mental language.
# And therefore, there are many ontologies (possibly an infinite number) that can be consistently held to represent reality.
(see Chapter 2, in ''Word and Object'').

The above argument is reminiscent of the theme in neopragmatism against the [[picture theory of language]], the idea that the goal of inquiry is to represent reality correctly with one's language.

A second critically influential philosopher to the neo-pragmatist is Thomas Kuhn who argued that our languages for representing reality, or what he called "paradigms", are only as good as they produce possible future experiments and observations. Kuhn, being a philosopher of science, argued in ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''&lt;ref name="Kuhn 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|year=1996|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that "scientific progress" was a kind of a misnomer; for Kuhn, we make progress in science whenever we throw off old scientific paradigms with their associated concepts and methods in favor of new paradigms which offer novel experiments to be done and new scientific ontologies. For Kuhn 'electrons' exist just so much as they are useful in providing us with novel experiments which will allow us to uncover more about the new paradigm we have adopted. Kuhn believes that different paradigms posit different things to exist in the world and are therefore [[commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] with each other. Another way of viewing this is that paradigms describe new languages, which allow us to describe the world in new ways. Kuhn was a fallibilist; he believed that all scientific paradigms (e.g. classical Newtonian mechanics, Einsteinian relativity) should be assumed to be, on the whole, false but good for a time as they give scientists new ideas to play around with. Kuhn's [[fallibilism]], [[holism]], emphasis on incommensurability, and ideas concerning objective reality are themes which often show up in neopragmatist writings.

Wilfrid Sellars argued against foundationalist justification in epistemology and was therefore also highly influential to the neopragmatists especially Rorty.&lt;ref&gt;deVries, Willem, "Wilfrid Sellars", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL=&lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/sellars/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Continental" influences===

Philosophers such as Derrida and Heidegger and their views on language have been highly influential to neopragmatist thinkers like Richard Rorty. Rorty has also emphasised the value of "historicist" or "genealogical" methods of philosophy typified by Continental thinkers such as Foucault.

=== Wittgenstein and language games ===
The "later" [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in the ''Philosophical Investigations''&lt;ref name="Wittgenstein 2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wittgenstein|first=Ludwig|title=Philosophical Investigations|year=2009|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=Malden, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues contrary to his earlier views in the ''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus''&lt;ref name="Wittgenstein 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wittgenstein|first=Ludwig|title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the role of language is not to describe reality but rather to perform certain actions in communities. The [[language-game]] is the concept Wittgenstein used to emphasize this. Wittgenstein believed roughly that: 
# Languages are used to obtain certain ends within communities.
# Each language has its own set of rules and objects to which it refers. 
# Just as board games have rules guiding what moves may be made so do languages within communities where the moves to be made within a language game are the types of objects that may be talked about intelligibly.
# Two people participating in two different language-games cannot be said to communicate in any relevant way.

Many of the themes found in Wittgenstein are found in neopragmatism. Wittgenstein's emphasis of the importance of "use" in language to accomplish communal goals and the problems associated with trying to communicate between two different language games finds much traction in neopragmatist writings.

== Richard Rorty and anti-representationalism ==

Richard Rorty was influenced by James, Dewey, Sellars, Quine, Kuhn, Wittgenstein, Derrida, and Heidegger. He found common implications in the writings of many of these philosophers. Namely, he believed that these philosophers were all in one way or another trying to hit on the thesis that our language does not represent things in reality in any relevant way. Rather than situating our language in ways in order to get things right or correct Rorty says in the Introduction to the first volume of his philosophical papers that we should believe that beliefs are only habits with which we use to react and adapt to the world.&lt;ref name="Rorty 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rorty|first=Richard|title=Objectivity, Truth, and Relativism|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Rorty getting things right as they are "in themselves" is useless if not downright meaningless.

In 1995 Rorty wrote:
"I linguisticize as many pre-linguistic-turn philosophers as I can, in order to read them as prophets of the utopia in which all metaphysical problems have been dissolved, and religion and science have yielded their place to poetry."&lt;br&gt;
''Rorty and Pragmatism: The Philosopher Responds to His Critics'', edited by Herman J. Saatkamp (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1995).

This "linguistic turn" strategy aims to avoid what Rorty sees as the essentialisms ("truth," "reality," "experience") still extant in classical pragmatism. Rorty writes:

"[[Analytic philosophy]], thanks to its concentration on language, was able to defend certain crucial pragmatist theses better than James and Dewey themselves. [...] By focusing our attention on the relation between language and the rest of the world rather than between experience and nature, post-positivistic analytic philosophy was able to make a more radical break with the philosophical tradition."&lt;br&gt;
''Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society 21, no. 1 ''(Winter 1985).

== Distinguished from idealism and epistemic relativism ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
One way to understand the motivation and themes of the neopragmatist is to understand how neopragmatism (and pragmatism in general) distinguishes itself from both [[idealism]] and relativism. Neopragmatism is to be distinguished from idealism primarily in the fact that it does not, like idealism, believe that what is actually in the world is affected in any way by what individuals believe concerning it. Neopragmatism holds to the doctrine of a mind-independent reality while simultaneously maintaining that this world is not knowable in the classical [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] sense of the word "know". The neopragmatist views mind-independent reality to causally influence people's minds but whatever way that influence may be on the individual mind is up to the individual. Neopragmatism is to be distinguished from [[epistemic relativism]] on the force of the idea that in order to be an epistemic relativist one must be concerned about getting one's ideas "right" in relation to reality. The neopragmatist thesis views this to be a concern which is of no use and therefore is to be discarded. Neopragmatists hold that it makes no sense to talk about getting reality right due to the fact that this adds no utility to do so. The neopragmatist is concerned with developing beliefs and habits which allow one to adapt to one's environment with success rather than generating pictures used in order to describe reality. Since neopragmatism lacks any concern for generating descriptive pictures of reality the whole question of epistemic relativism is meaningless.

'''Nikolay Onufriyevich Lossky'''{{efn|{{lang-ru|Никола́й Ону́фриевич Ло́сский}}.}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɒ|s|k|i}}; {{OldStyleDate|6 December|1870|24 November}} – 24 January 1965), also known as '''N. O. Lossky''', was a [[Russia]]n philosopher, representative of Russian [[idealism]], [[gnosiology|intuitionist]] [[epistemology]], [[personalism]], [[libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarianism]], [[ethics]] and [[axiology]] ([[value theory]]). He gave his philosophical system the name ''intuitive-personalism''. Born in [[Latvia]], he spent his working life in St. Petersburg, New York, and Paris. He was the father of the influential [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Christian theologian]] [[Vladimir Lossky]].&lt;ref name="sciabarraEssay"&gt;Sciabarra, Chris Matthew. "[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/essays/randt1.htm Investigation: the Search for Ayn Rand's Russian Roots]." ''[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]]'' 1999-10. 2006-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Lossky was born in Krāslava, Latvia (then in the [[Russian Empire]]). His father, Onufry Lossky, had [[Belarus]]ian roots (his grandfather was a Greek-Catholic Uniate priest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istpravda.ru/bel/digest/13053/   Belarus is the part of the world...]&lt;/ref&gt;) and was  an [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]; his mother Adelajda Przylenicka was Polish and [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. He was expelled from school for propagating [[atheism]].

Lossky undertook post-graduate studies in Germany under [[Wilhelm Windelband]], [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[G. E. Müller]], receiving a master's degree in 1903 and a Doctorate in 1907.

Returning to Russia, he became a lecturer and subsequently Assistant Professor of philosophy in St.&amp;nbsp;Petersburg.

Lossky called for a Russian religious and spiritual reawakening while pointing out post-[[Russian Revolution of 1917|revolution]] excesses. At the same time, Lossky survived an elevator accident that nearly killed him, which caused him to turn back to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] under the direction of [[Pavel Florensky|Fr. Pavel Florensky]]. These criticisms and conversion cost Lossky his professorship of philosophy and led to his exile abroad, on the famed [[Philosophers' ship]] (in 1922) from the [[Soviet Union]] as a [[counter-revolutionary]].

Lossky was invited to [[Prague]] by [[Tomáš Masaryk]] and became Professor at the [[List of universities in the Czech Republic|Russian University of Prague]] at [[Bratislava]], in Czechoslovakia. Being part of a group of ex-[[Marxism|Marxists]], including [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Gershenzon]], [[Peter Berngardovich Struve]], [[Semyon Frank]]. Lossky, though a [[Fabian Månsson|Fabian]] socialist, contributed to the group's symposium named [http://www.vehi.net/vehi/index.html Vekhi] or [[vekhi|Signposts]]. He also helped the Harvard sociologist [[Pitirim Sorokin]] with his ''Social and Cultural Dynamics''

In 1947 N. O. Lossky took a position teaching theology at [[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary]], an Orthodox Christian seminary in [[Crestwood, New York]].

In 1961, after the death of his famous son, theologian [[Vladimir Lossky]], N. O. Lossky went to France. The last four years of his life were spent in illness there.

==Philosophy==

===Intuitivism and Slavophilism===
Lossky was one of the preeminent Russian [[Idealism|neo-idealists]] of his day. Lossky's Гносеология or [[gnosiology]] is called '''Intuitivist-Personalism''' and had in part adapted the [[Hegel]]ian dialectical approach of first addressing a problem in thought in terms of its expression as a duality or [[dichotomy]]. Once the problem is expressed as a dichotomy the two opposing ideas are fused in order to transcend the dichotomy. This transition is expressed in the concept of [[sobornost]], [[integrality]] or mystical communal union.&lt;ref&gt;Sciabarra, Chris Matthew (1995). Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical. Pennsylvania State University Press. {{ISBN|0-271-01441-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lossky also followed and developed his ontological and [[gnosiology|gnosiological]] interpretation of objective reality from Christian [[neoplatonism]] based on the Patristic Fathers. This along with [[Origen]] and the works of Russian mystics [[Ivan Kireevsky|Kireevsky]] and [[Aleksey Khomyakov|Khomyakov]] and the later works of [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|V. Solovyov]] among many others. Understanding and comprehension coming from addressing an object, as though part of the external world, something that joins the consciousness of the perceiving subject directly ([[noesis]], [[insight]]), then becoming memory, [[Gnosiology|intuitionism]] as the foundation of all [[noema]] or processes of consciousness. In that human consciousness comprehends the essence or [[noumena]] of an object and the object's external [[phenomenon]] which are then assembled into a complete organic whole called experience. Much of an object's defining and understanding in consciousness is not derived discursively but rather intuitively or instinctively as an object has no meaning outside of the whole of existence. Lossky summed up this concept in the term "all is [[imminent]] in all". As such much of reality as uncreated or uncaused is irrational, or random (see libertarianism below) and can not be validated rationally (i.e. freedom and love as energy are uncaused, uncreated). Therefore, consciousness in its interaction with reality operates not strictly as rational (only partially) much of consciousness operates intuitively. This is [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]]ly done by the [[nous]].  The [[nous]], consciousness or the focal point of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as the "organic connection" to the object and therefore the material world as a whole. The psyche here is the sensory input from the physical body to the inner being, mind or consciousness. This interaction causing different levels of maturing consciousness over time (reinterpretation). As a dynamic retention, experience constitutes the process of learning i.e. reflective [[inductive reasoning aptitude|differentiation]].

===Phenomenology and axiology===
Consequently, the [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|existence]] of objects can not be completely expressed with logic or words, nor validated with knowledge, due to objects having a [[supernatural]] essence or substance as their composition (supernatural in an ancient Greek philosophy or Orthodox Christian understanding of supernatural as uncreated or uncaused). Following an Orthodox Christian [[substance theory]] (see [[Gregory Palamas]]) energy and [[dunamis|potential]] do not have ontology without an [[sentient]] agent (i.e. [[idealism]]), Lossky coined the term "[[substantive agent]]" to validate that [[matter]] as well as [[energy]] are uncreated in substance, essence. This validation as part of [[gnosiology]] or Christian mysticism ([[Orthodoxy]]) as opposed to the Russian Materialist and nihilist position that states that objects have no "[[thing in itself]]" or no essence, substance behind their [[phenomenon]] (as in [[Positivism]]). Lossky based his intuitivism on gnosiology in that he taught [[first principles]] as uncreated or uncaused. Lossky's Axiology was the teaching of first principles [[dialectically]].  Russian philosophy based on Soloviev is expressed [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] in that the essence of an object can be akin to [[Noumenon]] (opposed to its appearance or [[phenomenon]]), but it can have [[randomness|random]] characteristics to its being or essence, characteristically [[sumbebekos]]. This is the basis of V Soloviev's arguments against [[Positivism]] which are the cornerstone of [[Russian philosophy]] contained in Soloviev's "Against the Positivists".
The validation (immediate apprehension) of truth, value and existence all being intuitive as expressed by Aristotle's [[Noesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Value and Existence «Ценность и существование»(1931) by Lossky N. O. and John S. Marshall published by George Allen &amp; Unwin LTD, 1935&lt;/ref&gt; Each event having value or existence because of substantive agents being engaged in the event, (via [[German idealism|Neo-idealism]]) giving the event value and existence.

===Sobornost and the world as an organic whole===
{{See also|A priori and a posteriori}}

One of the main points of Lossky's онтология or [[ontology]] is, the world is an organic whole as understood by human consciousness. [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]], insight ([[noesis]] in Greek) is the direct contemplation of objects, and furthermore the assembling of the entire set of [[cognition]] from sensory perception into a complete and undivided organic whole, i.e. experience. This expression of consciousness as without thought, raw and uninterpreted by the rational faculty in the mind. Thus the mind's dianoia (rational or logical faculty) in its deficiency, finiteness or inconclusiveness (due to logic's incompleteness) causes the perceived conflict between the [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivism]] (materialism, external world) and [[idealism]] (spiritual, inner experience) forms of philosophy.  Where intuitive or instinctual re-action is without rational processing of the rational faculty of the mind. It is outside of comprehension via the dianoia faculty of the mind, consciousness (Nous). Intuition being analogous with [[instinct]]ual [[consciousness]]. Intuition functions without rational or logical thought in its absorption of experience (called [[contemplation]]). Rational or logical thought via the dianoia of the [[nous]], then works in reflection as [[hindsight]] to organize experience into a comprehensible order i.e. [[ontology]]. The memory, knowledge derived from the rationalizing faculty of the mind is called epistemological knowledge. Intuitive knowledge or [[Gnosis]] (preprocessed knowledge or uninterpreted) then being made by the logical facility in the mind into history or memory. Intuition rather than a rationalization (also see [[Henri Bergson]] whom influenced Lossky)&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Bakhtin]]: creation of a prosaics By Gary Saul Morson, Caryl Emerson
pgs 78-180 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BViC_wkbd4oC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=Lossky+Bergson&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EfU3TueGKc-ctwehisX5Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Lossky%20Bergson&amp;f=false] Stanford University Press {{ISBN|0-8047-1822-9}} {{ISBN|978-0804718226}}&lt;/ref&gt; determining factor it manifests as an integral factor of or during an actual conscious experience. Lossky's ontology being consistent with [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[Optimism#Philosophy|optimism]] expressed as the [[Best of all possible worlds]] in contrast to the [[pessimism]] and [[nihilism]] of more pro-Western Russian philosophers. Lossky's work is also opposed to the pagan elements of the pagan philosophers that were an influence on his work. In that the logical faculty of the mind was only finite in a temporal sense and will eventually become infinite (by [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]]), as such it seeks the infinite rather than opposes it. Lossky believed that philosophy would transcend its rational limits and manifest a mystical understanding of experience. This would include an understanding that encompasses the intuitive, irrational, philosophically (as done in [[stochastics]]) rather than the strictly pagan approach of a good deterministic force opposed to an evil irrational indeterminate force. This of course being the teaching of Christian [[faith]] as a philosophical principle (called [[free will]]) and [[intrinsic]] component to conscious existence, one that manifests ''sobornost'' in the transcending of the pagan dichotomy of reason versus superstition or determinism versus in-determinism.

===Knowledge and memory===
{{See also|Noetic Consciousness}}

Once knowledge is abstracted from conscious experience it becomes [[Epistemology|epistemological]] knowledge and is then stored in an ontological format in the mind (the format itself ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''). The manipulation of memory and or reapplication of memory as knowledge as post-processed knowledge i.e. [[Epistemology]]. Lossky's Ontology as an agent's Сущность (the "essence") expressed as [[being]] and or [[Metaphor of the sun|becoming]] is possible as both the person transcends time and space while being closely connected with the whole world, while in this world. Much of Lossky's working out of an ontological theory of knowledge was done in collaboration with his close friend [[Semen L. Frank]].

===Metaphysical libertarianism===
{{See also|theodicy|metaphysical libertarianism}}

Lossky as a metaphysical libertarian taught that all people have uncreated [[energeia|energy]] ([[Aristotle]]) or [[potentiality|potential]] ([[Plotinus]]). This being very much inline with the [[vitalism]] of his day. Though Lossky did not strictly adhere to vitalism but rather to its predecessor [[Monadology]] and its living forces ([[Potentiality|dynamis]]) theory. This is to contrast [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s theory of Monadology against [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian]] [[Bodymind|mind-body]] dualism. This as a rejection of vitalism in its dualism of mind and body being of different substances. For Lossky's [[Monadology|Substantive Agents]] have potential (dynamis) and they can act (beings have [[Energeia|energy]]) upon, from this potential. All power or potential comes from the individual. That spontaneous or organic reality structures or orders itself to reconcile opposing forces (sobornost), doing so while maintaining order and freewill. Each pole of existence (the created and uncreated of gnosiology) or opposing ideologies, reaching compromise through value and existence and manifesting in a complete organic whole (sobornost).&lt;ref name="HRP1"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nikolay |last=Lossky|title=History of Russian Philosophy "История российской Философии "|year=1951|publisher=International Universities Press Inc|location=U.S.A|isbn=978-0-8236-8074-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|Second Section: That selection is the agent's free act. Consequently, the temporal order of events is not uniform even in the inorganic nature. It is quite possible that although some two electrons have millions of time repulsed each other, they will not do so the next time. But functional connections between ideal forms conditioning the existence of the world as a ''system''-e.g. mathematical principles and the laws of the hierarchy of values and their significance for conduct conditioning the presence of meaning in the world-are independent of the agents' will. Violation of these laws is unthinkable, but they do not destroy the agent's freedom: they merely create the possibility of activity as such and of its value. Those laws condition the cosmic structure within the frame work of which there is freedom for an infinite variety of activities. The system of spatiotemporal and numerical forms provides room for activities that are opposed to one another in direction, value, and significance for the world. The absence of rigidly uniform connection between events does not make science impossible. It is sufficient for science that there should be more or less regular connection between events in time. The lower the agent's stage of development, the more uniform are their manifestations. In those cases there may be statistical laws. Many misunderstandings of the doctrine of free will are disposed of by distinguishing between ''formal'' and ''material'' freedom. Formal freedom means that in each given case an agent may refrain from some particular manifestation and replace it by another. That freedom is absolute and cannot be lost under any circumstance. Material freedom means the degree of creative power possessed by an agent, and finds expression in what he is capable of creating. It is unlimited in the Kingdom of God, the members of which unanimously combine their forces for communal creativeness and even derive help from God's omnipotence. But agents outside the Kingdom of God are in a state of spiritual deterioration and have very little material freedom, though their formal freedom is unimpaired. Life outside the Kingdom of God is the result of the wrong use of free will.''|||From History of Russian Philosophy section on "N O Lossky the Intuitivists" pg 260''&lt;ref name=HRP1/&gt;}} Lossky's argument that determinism can not account for the cause of energy in the Universe. Energy being a substance that can not be created or destroyed (see the law of [[conservation of energy]]).
Each agent accounting for their existence as their own dynamistic manifestation. Dynamistic manifestation as being that of act or [[energy]] derived from a [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] interpretation.&lt;ref name="HRP1"/&gt;{{cquote|First section: Determinists deny freedom of the will on the ground that every event has a cause. They mean by causality the order of temporal sequence of one event after other events and the uniformity of that sequence. [[Proximate causation|Causation]], [[generation]], creation and all other dynamic aspects of [[causality]] are ruled out. Lossky proves that the will is free, taking as his starting point the law of causality but defending a '''dynamistic''' interpretation of it. Every event arises not out of itself, but is created by someone: it cannot be created by other events: having a [[Time|temporal]] form [[Event (philosophy)|events]] fall away every instant into the realm of the past and have no creative power to generate the future. Only supertemporal substantival agents-i.e., actual and potential personalities- are bearers of creative power: they create events as their own vital manifestations. According to the dynamistic interpretation of causality it is necessary to distinguish among the conditions under which an event takes place the ''cause'' from the ''occasion'' of its happening. The cause is always the substantival agent himself as the bearer of creative power, and the other circumstances are merely ''occasions'' for its manifestations, which are neither forced nor predetermined by them. The agents' creative power is ''superqualitative'' and does not therefore predetermine which particular values an agent will select as his final end.''From History of Russian Philosophy section on "N O Lossky the Intuitivists" pg 260''&lt;ref name=HRP1/&gt;}}

==Theology and Neoplatonism==
Much of the theology that Lossky covers (as his own) in the book History of [[Russian Philosophy]] is inline with the idealism of [[Origen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quodlibet.net/articles/moore-origen.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; Lossky's [[idealism]] is based on Origen's. In that the relationship between the mystic, religious understanding of God and a philosophical one there have been various stages of development in the history of the Roman East. The nous as mind (rational and intuitive understanding) in Greek Christian philosophy is given the central role of understanding only when it is placed or reconciled with the heart or soul of the person. Earlier versions of Christian and Greek philosophical [[syncretism]] are in modern times referred to as Neoplatonic. An example of this can be seen in the works of [[Origen]] and his teaching on the nous as to Origen, all souls pre-existed with their Creator in a perfect, spiritual (non-material) state as "[[nous]]," that these minds then fell away so to pursue an individual and independent existence apart from God. Because all beings were created with absolute freedom and free will, God, not being a tyrant, would not force his creations to return to Him. According to Origen, God's infinite love and respect for His creatures allowed for this. Instead, God created the material world, universe or cosmos. God then initiated the [[aeon]]s or history. God did this for the purpose of, through love and compassion, guiding his creations back to [[theoria|contemplation]] of His infinite, limitless mind. This was according to Origen, the perfect state.&lt;ref&gt;Apokatastasis- In pre-Christian Stoic and Middle Platonic philosophy, this term referred to the universal restoration of the cosmos to the state in which it was first constituted by the divine mind or first principle. The seminal Christian theologian Origen of Alexandria used this term to denote the final restoration of all souls to God. According to Origen, all souls pre-existed with their Creator in a perfect, spiritual (non-material) state as "minds," but later fell away in order to pursue an existence independent of God. Since all souls were created absolutely free, God could not simply force them to return to Him (this was, according to Origen, due to God's boundless love and respect for His creatures). Instead, God created the material cosmos, and initiated history, for the purpose of guiding the wayward souls back to contemplation of His infinite mind, which is, according to Origen, the perfect state. This obviously excludes any concept of eternal damnation or hell. {{cite web |url=http://www.theandros.com/glossary.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060620083238/http://www.theandros.com/glossary.html |archivedate=2006-06-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the specifics of this are not necessarily what Lossky taught in his theology courses, since dogma in a general sense, is what is taught as theology. N. O. Lossky also was inline with the common distinctions of Orthodox Christian theology. Like the [[Essence-Energies distinction]] for example. Though Lossky did pursue a position of reconciliation based on mutual cooperation between East and West. Lossky taught this co-operation as organic and or [[spontaneous order]], integrality, and unity called [[sobornost]]. Sobornost can also be translated to mean catholic.

'''Norman Duncan Kemp Smith''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] (5 May 1872 – 3 September 1958) was a Scottish philosopher who was Professor of Psychology (1906–14) and Philosophy (1914–19) at [[Princeton University]] and was Professor of [[Logic]] and [[Metaphysics]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1919–45).&lt;ref&gt;name="times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Obituary: Prof. N. Kemp Smith – Kantian scholar |work=[[The Times]] |publisher=The Times Digital Archive |page= 11 |date=  6 September 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is noted for his 1929 English translation of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''.

The '''Kemp Smith Room''' in Edinburgh University's Philosophy Department is named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born '''Norman Smith''' on 5 May 1872&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humesociety.org/scholarship/scholars/kempsmith.asp&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dundee]], Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porteous|first1=A.

==Career==

Smith graduated MA from [[St Andrews University]] and received his doctorate (PhD) in 1902. He lectured in philosophy and psychology at Princeton from 1906 to 1916, and at Edinburgh from 1919 until his retirement in 1945. 

He was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1921. His proposers were [[Ralph Allan Sampson]], [[Thomas James Jehu]], [[Charles Glover Barkla]] and [[Charles Sarolea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938 he moved to 14 Kilgraston Road in south Edinburgh, a house designed by [[Sir Robert Matthew]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ed.ac.uk/ppls/philosophy/about/history/norman-kemp-smith&lt;/ref&gt;

His translation of Immanuel Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason'' is often used as the standard English version of the text. His commentaries on the ''Critique'' are also well regarded, as are his works on [[David Hume]] and other philosophers. He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1947 to 1948. A portrait by the Edinburgh artist [[Adam Bruce Thomson]] is held by the University of Edinburgh's Fine Art Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/artists/adam-bruce-thomson/paintings/slideshow#/7|title=Portrait of Norman Kemp Smith|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norwood Russell Hanson''' (August 17, 1924 – April 18, 1967) was an American [[philosophy|philosopher of science]]. Hanson was a pioneer in advancing the argument that observation is theory-laden — that observation language and theory language are deeply interwoven — and that historical and contemporary comprehension are similarly deeply interwoven. His single most central intellectual concern was the comprehension and development of a logic of discovery.

==Work==
Hanson's best-known work is ''Patterns of Discovery'' (1958), in which he argues that what we see and perceive is not what our senses receive, but is instead filtered sensory information, where the filter is our existing preconceptions &amp;ndash; a concept later called a 'thematic framework.' He cited optical illusions such as the famous old Parisienne woman (''Patterns of Discovery'', p.&amp;nbsp;11), which can be seen in different ways. Hanson drew a distinction between 'seeing as' and 'seeing that' which became a key idea in evolving theories of perception and meaning. He wanted to formulate a logic explaining how scientific discoveries take place. He used [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'s notion of [[abductive reasoning|abduction]] for this.&lt;ref name=RST-HermTerm&gt;Schwendtner, Tibor and Ropolyi, László and Kiss, Olga (eds.): ''Hermeneutika és a természettudományok (Meaning of the title: Hermeneutics and the natural sciences)''. Áron Kiadó, Budapest, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanson's other books include ''The Concept of the Positron'' (1963). Hanson was a staunch defender of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]], which regards questions such as ''"Where was the particle before I measured its position?"'' as meaningless. The philosophical issues involved were important elements in Hanson's views of [[perception]] and [[epistemology]]. He was intrigued by [[paradox]]es, and with the related concepts of [[uncertainty]], [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidability/unprovability]], and [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness]]; he sought models of cognition that could embrace these elements, rather than simply explain them away.

Hanson's posthumous works include ''What I Do Not Believe and Other Essays'' (1971) and ''Constellations and Conjectures'' (1973). He is also known for the essays ''What I Do Not Believe'' and ''The Agnostic's Dilemma,'' among other writings on belief systems.

From [[Michael Scriven]]'s preface to Hanson's posthumous ''Perception and Discovery'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a general sense Hanson continues the application of the Wittgensteinian approach to the philosophy of science, as [[Friedrich Waissman|Waissman]] and [[Stephen Toulmin|Toulmin]] have also done. But he goes much further than they, exploring questions about perception and discovery in more detail, and ... tying in the history of science for exemplification and for its own benefit. Hanson was one of the rare thinkers in the tradition of [[William Whewell|Whewell]] &amp;ndash; a man he much admired &amp;ndash; who could really benefit from and yield benefits for both the history and philosophy of science.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influence ==

Hanson's 1958 work ''Patterns of Discovery'' was followed up on by [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] in Kuhn's 1962 landmark, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', that challenged prevailing conceptions of science's development, conceptions that ranged from the strictures of [[logical empiricism]] to naive presumptions of objective [[scientific realism]].  Hanson led the move to carry [[history of science]] into [[philosophy of science]]—two rather divergent fields at the time—as Hanson insisted that proper study of one demanded deep understanding of the other.  With Kuhn's contribution, Hanson's interdisciplinary view became generally accepted.  Similarly, [[Robert Nozick]]'s 1974 work on [[political philosophy]], ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', quotes Norwood to support Nozick's aim to understand the "whole political realm" by "understanding the political realm in terms of the nonpolitical".&lt;ref&gt;Nozick, Robert, ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia'' (1974) p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nozick, ''Anarchy, State, and Utopia'' (1974) p. 335, quotes Norwood, ''Patterns of Discovery'', pp.&amp;nbsp;119–120: "Though the ''X'' (color, heat, and so on) of an object can be explained in terms of its being composed of parts of certain ''X''-quality (colors in certain array, average heat of parts, and so on), the whole realm of ''X'' cannot be explained or understood in this manner".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:VMF-452 WWII Logo.jpg|right|thumb|Hanson designed the VMF-452 logo]]

Hanson was born in 1924 in [[Cortland County]], New York. He studied trumpet with the legendary [[William Vacchiano]] and played at [[Carnegie Hall]], but his musical career was interrupted by [[World War II]]. He enlisted in the [[United States Coast Guard]], later transferring to the [[United States Marine Corps]], where he trained as a fighter pilot, developing a reputation as a 'hot pilot' (famously looping the Golden Gate Bridge). He served on the ill-fated [[USS Franklin (CV-13)|USS ''Franklin'']] in the [[VMF-452]] "Skyraiders" Squadron, for which he designed the unit's logo.&lt;ref name=Millstein&gt;Millstein, ''U.S. Marine Corps Aviation Insignia'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''Franklin'' was bombed and nearly destroyed on 19 March 1945, his [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]] was described as 'the last plane off Big Ben.'

After flying over 2,000 hours, he returned to civilian life, seeking an education via the [[G.I. Bill]] rather than continuing a life in music. He took degrees from the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Columbia University]], then proceeded with his new wife Fay to the UK in 1949, under a [[Fulbright Scholarship]]. He completed multiple degrees at both [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]], and stayed in Britain to continue teaching and writing.

[[File:HansonBearcat1200.jpg|left|thumb|Hanson's Bearcat]]
Hanson left the life of a Cambridge don to return to the U.S. in 1957, founding the [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] Department of History and Philosophy of Science, the first of its kind, and receiving a Fellowship at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. In 1963, Hanson moved to [[Yale University]]. He also continued to fly &amp;ndash; an [[T-6 Texan|AT-6 Texan]] trainer, and later a Grumman [[F8F Bearcat|F8F-2 Bearcat]]. His unusual style and personal history, including his aerobatics over the [[Yale Bowl]] and at airshows as 'The Flying Professor,' were noted by a generation of students &amp;ndash; including [[John Kerry]]. His time at Yale was strained by campus politics, where he was caught in the midst of an infamous 1964-65 fight over Yale's tenure policies (the "[[Bernstein Affair]]").&lt;ref&gt;[[Seyla Benhabib]] et al., ''Pragmatism, Critique, Judgment: Essays for Richard J. Bernstein'', {{ISBN|0-262-52427-9}}, pp. 337–341 visible via online preview at [https://books.google.com/books?id=rJm1GBauVdUC books.google.com] &amp;ndash; The [[Bernstein Affair]], which "has gone down in the annals of academe as one of the most contested cases of tenure in the United States" and which involved all-night protests and thousands of picketing students. Colleague Robert Brumbaugh characterizes the situation by saying "We could not have gotten tenure for Aristotle when he was thirty-two...[and personally] I could not have gotten it." Hanson, a newcomer to the department, was deliberately placed in the difficult position of doing "dirty work" for others, for which he drew much animus. Frustrated, Hanson wrote a contentious open letter to the ''New York Times'' to explain his thinking, concluding that although Bernstein's writing was "well-structured, clever, and urbane," it was "uniformly unoriginal"; he feared that basing tenure decisions on popularity risked turning Yale into a "banana republic university, drifting aimlessly on the winds of student preference." Negative repercussions over the affair damaged the prestige of Yale and its Department of Philosophy for years.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hanson died in 1967, when his [[Grumman F8F Bearcat|Bearcat]] crashed in dense fog en route to Ithaca, New York. He was survived by wife Fay and children Trevor (b. 1955) and Leslie (b. 1958). His rich, complex life &amp;ndash; ranging from Golden Gloves boxing to drawing illustrations for Homer's ''Iliad''; from camping on a Harley-Davidson to testifying before the U.S. Senate; from tough city youth to distinguished scholarship &amp;ndash; was cut short at the age of 42, with ten books in progress, including a history of aerodynamic theory.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2194">'''Open individualism''' is the view in the philosophy of personal identity, according to which there exists only one [[Identity (philosophy)|numerically identical]] subject, which is everyone at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolak | first = Daniel | title = I Am You: The Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics | publisher = Springer | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-4020-2999-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a theoretical solution for the question of [[personal identity]], being contrasted with empty individualism, the view that personal identities correspond to a fixed pattern that instantaneously disappears with the passage of time, and with closed individualism, the common view that personal identities are particular to subjects and yet survive time.

The term was coined by philosopher [[Daniel Kolak]], though this view has been described at least since the time of the [[Upanishads]], in the late [[Bronze Age]]. Its sentence "[[Tat tvam asi]]," meaning "You are that," is an example. Notable people having expressed similar views (in various forms) include the [[Sufism|Sufi]] thinker Aziz al-Nasafi, [[Averroes]], German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], Indian mystic [[Meher Baba]], [[Alan Watts]], as well as renowned physicists [[Erwin Schrödinger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whatislife.stanford.edu/LoCo_files/What-is-Life.pdf |title=What is life? |last=Schrödinger |first=Erwin |orig-year=First published 1944 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113143420/http://whatislife.stanford.edu/LoCo_files/What-is-Life.pdf |archive-date=November 13, 2014 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freeman Dyson]], and [[Fred Hoyle]].

{{Unreferenced|date=January 2008}}
[[File:Tzompantli Tovar.jpeg|right|350px|thumb|A depiction of a ''[[tzompantli]]'', or skull rack, associated with the depiction of a temple dedicated to [[Huitzilopochtli]] from Juan de Tovar's manuscript.]]

The '''Ramírez Codex''' (also known as the '''Tovar Codex''') is a post-[[Spanish conquest of Mexico|conquest]] [[codex]] from the late 16th century entitled ''Relación del origen de los indios que hábitan esta Nueva España según sus Historias'' ("Relation of the Origin of the Indians who Inhabit this [[New Spain]] according to their Histories").

Ascribed to [[Juan de Tovar]], most scholars believe that he based this work on an earlier [[Nahuatl]] source (now lost), that is presumed to have been compiled by one or more Christianized [[Aztec]]s sometime shortly after the conquest. This earlier document (or documents) is often referred to as "''[[Crónica X]]''" ("Chronicle X") and is proposed to be the original or influential source of a number of early manuscripts (such as the Ramírez, [[Diego Durán#Literary works and influence|Durán]] and [[Juan de Acosta|Acosta]] codices), based on similarities in their content.

The Tovar manuscript was created using traditional indigenous techniques and consists of four manuscripts that narrate the history of the [[Aztec]]s, from their peregrination into the [[Anahuac Valley|Anahuac valley]] to the fall of [[Tenochtitlan]].  It also discusses some aspects of the Aztec religion.

The Ramírez Codex (Tovar manuscript) was discovered in 1856 by [[José Fernando Ramírez]] in the library of the convent of San Francisco in Mexico {{Failed verification|date=March 2008}}. There remain two extant copies of the codex. One is located in the [[Mexico]]'s [[Museo Nacional de Antropología]], while the other is in the library of [[John Carter Brown]], in [[Rhode Island]].

The codex was first published in 1847 as a preface to ''[[Crónica mexicayotl]]'', a 1598 work by [[Fernando Alvarado Tezozomoc]].

'''''South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book analyzing the [[philosophy]] and [[popular culture]] effects of ''[[South Park]]'', published by Open Court.  The book is edited by [[Richard Hanley]].

In an interview about the book, Richard Hanley explained why he chose the topic of ''South Park'' for philosophical analysis: "''South Park'' is like the ''Simpsons'', but with a lot less restrictions, and almost every episode pushes the envelope."&lt;ref name="rhodes"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor Auxier also gave a talk on his contribution to the work, at [[Green Mountain College]].&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;  ''South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating'' also addresses issues of [[applied ethics]], such as [[stem-cell research]], [[euthanasia]], [[Doping (sport)|drugs in sports]], [[religion]], [[blasphemy]], [[human evolution]], [[Environmentalism|environment]], and [[gay marriage]].&lt;ref name="rhodes" /&gt;  The book is organized into five sections by topic, which include "Religion and Other Disabilities", "Politics and Other Sacred Cows", "Morality and Other Urges", "Science, Logic and Other Really, Really Clever Stuff" and "Humor and Other Insertable Devices".&lt;ref name="rhodes" /&gt;

== Reception ==
Jerry Rhodes noted in an interview published in the [[University of Delaware]]'s ''UDaily'' that Hanley's work celebrates the ability of ''South Park'' to confront issues that make most viewers uncomfortable.&lt;ref name="rhodes" /&gt;  Victor Greto wrote in ''The News Journal'', that though some of the humor in the book "falls flat", most readers will laugh out loud, but also squirm a bit.&lt;ref name="greto" /&gt;  Greto went on to note the book's proclivity towards certain racial epithets and language, as well as a critique of religion.&lt;ref name="greto" /&gt; Religions analyzed in the work include [[Scientology]] and the [[Xenu]] mythology, as presented in the ''South Park'' episode, [[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]], which Hanley discusses in comparison to elements of [[Christianity]] and the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]].&lt;ref name="greto" /&gt;

Between the years of 1999 and 2014, Rohmer investigated and taught at the Institute for Philosophy of [[Humboldt-Universität Berlin]] and at the Institute for Philosophy [[Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas]] in Madrid.

Rohmer’s research has been supported by many recognized scientific organizations such as the [[German Academic Exchange Service]], the [[Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft]], the Meyer-Struckmann Foundation, and the [[Fritz Thyssen Foundation]].

Between 2008 and 2010, Rohmer was holder of an Intra-European Fellowship in the Program [[Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions]] of the [[European Union]]. Rohmer wrote various monographs which parts especially from the [[philosophy]] of [[Hegel]], [[Ortega y Gasset]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Helmuth Plessner]].

He also translated the Spanish [[Philosopher]] [[Ortega y Gasset]] and the English [[Philosopher]] [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in German and edited their work in the  publishing companies [[Suhrkamp Verlag]] and Karl Alber. His book ''Love - Future of an Emotion'', (original title: Liebe - Zukunft einer Emotion) was translated in Spanish and was edited in Herder publishing house, Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;Stascha Rohmer Interview (Spanish) at Herder Publishing House, Barcelona (2013): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jytcsqA92Uk&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented in the channel, TVE2 in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rtve.es/alacarta/videos/para-todos-la-2/para-todos-2-entrevista-stascha-rohmer-filosofo/1687795.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 he becomes a full-time Professor of [[Philosophy of Law]] at the Faculty of Law in the [[Universidad de Medellín]] in [[Medellín]], [[Colombia]]. In 2016 he becomes the director of the ''[[Philosophy of Law]] program''. One of the main goals of his research is to establish a bridging between [[Environmental philosophy]], [[Philosophy of Law]] and [[Environmental law]].&lt;ref&gt;Rohmer´s conference: ''Nature and Law: Is there a Whiteheadian perspective on the theory of rights?'', at [[Pomona College]], Claremont, USA (June 2015): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7Idy7V55U0&lt;/ref&gt; He was the director of the first international congress ''Protection of Biodiversity as a Philosophical and Legal Problem'', which took place at [[Universidad de Medellín]] between the 16th to the 18th of March in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.udem.edu.co/index.php/eventos/congreso-biodiversidad&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the director of the congress  ''Somos Memoria. La Escuela de Madrid y El Exilio Español del 39'' at [[Instituto Cervantes]]&lt;ref&gt;See congress program on the side of [[Instituto Cervantes]] Berlin: http://berlin.cervantes.es/FichasCultura/Ficha88494_57_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in Berlin (2013). In collaboration with [[Volker Gerhardt]], he directed the congress ''Nature, Technique, Culture'' at the [[Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin]] (2008).&lt;ref&gt;Publications of the conference lectures by Karl Alber Publishing House (2012): http://www.verlag-alber.de/suche/details_html?k_tnr=48471&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since 2008, Rohmer has been a permanent member of the [[Whitehead Research Project]] (WRP) in [[Claremont, California]] ([[United States]]), directed by [[Roland Faber]].

Since 1987 Rohmer is committed and engeaged for [[Navapalos Foundation]]. ''Navapalos Foundation'' - a ''non-profit organization'' devoted to promoting environmental awareness - was a pioneering project with his headquarters in [[Madrid]]  and the village Navapalos, located in the province of [[Soria]], [[Castile and León]], [[Spain]]. The Navapalos Foundation worked and investigated in ''building with earth'', Low-cost housing-conceptions (based on [[Wattle and daub]]-techniques), [[Renewable energy]] and [[Sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;Navapalos Foundation at German Page of Wikipedia: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiftung_Navapalos&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Surrogacy''' is an arrangement, often supported by a legal agreement, whereby a woman agrees to become pregnant, carry the [[pregnancy]] to due term, and give birth to a child or children, all of this for another person or persons, who are or will ultimately become the parent(s) of the newborn child or children.

People may seek a surrogacy arrangement when pregnancy is medically impossible, when [[pregnancy risks]] present an unacceptable danger to the mother's health, or when a man alone or a male couple wishes to have a child. In these arrangements, monetary compensation may or may not be involved. Receiving money for the arrangement is considered commercial surrogacy; receiving no compensation beyond reimbursement of reasonable expenses is altruistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reproductive Law|url=http://familyhealthlaw.ca/reproductive-law/|publisher=Lisa Feldstrin Law Office|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legality and cost of surrogacy varies widely between [[jurisdiction]]s, sometimes resulting in problematic interstate or international surrogacy arrangements.

Laws of some countries restrict or regulate surrogacy and its consequences. Those wanting to seek a surrogacy arrangement who, however, live where it is banned may travel to a jurisdiction that permits it. (See [[surrogacy laws by country]] and [[fertility tourism]].)

==Types of surrogacy==
The [[fertilisation]] of the egg may take place in a number of ways, each of which has implications for the genetic relationship of the resulting child with the surrogate and the future parents. There are two main types of surrogacy: [[gestational]] surrogacy and traditional surrogacy. In the United States, gestational surrogacy is more common than traditional surrogacy and is considered less legally complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using a Surrogate Mother: What You Need to Know|url=http://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/guide/using-surrogate-mother|publisher= [[WebMD]]|accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional surrogacy===
Traditional surrogacy (also known as partial, genetic, natural or straight surrogacy&lt;ref name=imrie2014 /&gt;) involves natural&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(fafd1pmmaskddt55stz4qvuo))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&amp;objectname=mcl-722-853 "Surrogate Parenting Act (Excerpt){{spaced ndash}} Act 199 of 1988]. [[Michigan Legislature]]. Retrieved July 7, 201gsanket and pragati
.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[artificial insemination]] of a surrogate. If the intended father's sperm is used in the insemination, then the resulting child is genetically related to the intended father and genetically related to the surrogate. If donor sperm is used, the resulting child is not genetically related to either intended parent but is genetically related to the surrogate.

In some cases, an insemination may be performed privately by the parties without the intervention of a doctor or physician. In some jurisdictions, the 'commissioning parents' using donor sperms need to go through an adoption process in order to have legal rights in respect to the resulting child. Many fertility centers which provide for surrogacy assist the parties through the process.

=== Gestational surrogacy ===
Gestational surrogacy (also known as host or full surrogacy&lt;ref name=imrie2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Imrie|first1=Susan|last2=Jadva|first2=Vasanti|title=The long-term experiences of surrogates: relationships and contact with surrogacy families in genetic and gestational surrogacy arrangements|journal=Reproductive BioMedicine Online|date=4 July 2014|volume=29|issue=4|pages=424–435|doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2014.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was first achieved in April 1986.&lt;ref name=People-GS&gt;http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20096199,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; It takes place when an [[embryo]] created by [[In vitro fertilisation|''in vitro'' fertilization]] (IVF) technology is implanted in a surrogate, sometimes called a gestational carrier. Gestational surrogacy may take a number of forms, but in each form the resulting child is genetically unrelated to the surrogate:

* the embryo is created using the intended father's sperm and the intended mother's eggs. The resulting child is genetically related to both intended parents.
* the embryo is created using the intended father's sperm and a donor egg where the donor is not the surrogate.  The resulting child is genetically related to the intended father.
* the embryo is created using the intended mother's egg and donor sperm. The resulting child is genetically related to the intended mother.
* a donor embryo is implanted in a surrogate. Such an embryo may be available when others undergoing IVF have embryos left over, which they donate to others. The resulting child is genetically unrelated to the intended parent(s).

== Surrogacy agencies ==
In places where surrogacy is legal, couples may enlist the help of a third party agency to oversee the process of finding a surrogate, entering into a contract with her and recommend fertility centers for insemination, generally via IVF. These agencies can help make sure that surrogates are screened with psychological evaluations and other medical tests so as to ensure the best chance of healthy deliveries. They also usually facilitate all legal matters concerning the two parties (intended parents and surrogate).

==History==
Having another woman bear a child for a couple to raise, usually with the male half of the couple as the genetic father, is referred to in antiquity. Babylonian law and [[custom (law)|custom]] allowed this practice, and an infertile woman could use the practice to avoid a [[divorce]], which would otherwise be inevitable.&lt;ref name=JN243&gt;{{cite book |title=Early Mesopotamia Society and Economy at the Dawn of History |last=Postgate |first=J.N. |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-11032-7 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721914-restrictive-rules-are-neither-surrogates-interests-nor-babys-carrying-child&lt;/ref&gt;

Many developments in medicine, social customs, and legal proceedings worldwide paved the way for modern surrogacy:&lt;ref name=Merino&gt;{{cite book|last=Merino|first=Faith|title=Adoption and Surrogate Pregnancy|year=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrogacy has the potential for various kinds of clash between surrogate mothers and intended parents. For instance, the intended parents of the [[fetus]] may ask for an abortion when complications arise and the surrogate mother may oppose the abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/surrogate-mother-sues-over-demand-for-abortion-665395.html "Surrogate Mother Sues over Demand for Abortion"]. ''[[The Independent]]''.  Retrieved February 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tuckerlegal.com/new-hampshire-surrogacy-talk-about/ "New Hampshire Surrogacy Law: What No One Wants to Talk About"]. Retrieved August 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
Surrogacy is controversial around the world, raising difficult moral, social and legal issues. As a result, the legal situation varies considerably. Many countries do not have laws which specifically deal with surrogacy. Some countries ban surrogacy outright, while others ban commercial surrogacy but allow altruistic surrogacy (in which the surrogate is not financially compensated). Some countries allow commercial surrogacy, with few restrictions. Some jurisdictions extend a ban on surrogacy to international surrogacy. In some jurisdictions rules applicable to [[adoption]]s apply and in others the practice is unregulated.

As of 2013, places where a woman could legally be paid to carry another's child through IVF and embryo transfer included [[India]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Russia]], [[Thailand]], [[Ukraine]], [[Iran]] and a few [[U.S. states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=July 2014}} Bhalla, Nita; Thapliyal, Mansi (September 30, 2013). [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/811861?nlid=35152_2043&amp;src=wnl_edit_medn_obgy&amp;uac=149266AJ&amp;spon=16 "India Seeks to Regulate Its Booming Surrogacy Industry"]. [[Reuters Health Information]] (via [[Medscape]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws dealing with surrogacy must deal with:
* enforceability of surrogacy agreements. In some jurisdictions, they are void or prohibited, and some jurisdictions distinguish between commercial and altruistic surrogacy.
* the different issues raised by traditional and gestational surrogacy
* mechanisms for the legal recognition of the intended parents as the legal parents, either by pre-birth orders or by post-birth adoption

Although laws differ widely from one jurisdiction to another, some generalizations are possible:

The historical legal assumption has been that the woman giving birth to a child is that child's legal mother, and the only way for another woman to be recognized as the mother is through adoption (usually requiring the birth mother's formal abandonment of parental rights).

Even in jurisdictions that do not recognize surrogacy arrangements, if the genetic parents and the birth mother proceed without any intervention from the government and have no changes of heart along the way, they will likely be able to achieve the effects of surrogacy by having the surrogate mother give birth and then give the child up for private adoption to the intended parents.

If the jurisdiction specifically prohibits surrogacy, however, and authorities find out about the arrangement, there may be financial and legal consequences for the parties involved. One jurisdiction ([[Quebec]]) prevented the genetic mother's adoption of the child even though that left the child with no legal mother.&lt;ref name="quebectest"&gt;Baudouin, Christine. "[http://www.cfas.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=772&amp;Itemid=523 "Surrogacy in Quebec: First Legal Test"]. [[Canadian Fertility and Andrology Society]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurisdictions specifically prohibit only commercial and not altruistic surrogacy. Even jurisdictions that do not prohibit surrogacy may rule that surrogacy contracts (commercial, altruistic, or both) are void. If the contract is either prohibited or void, then there is no recourse if one party to the agreement has a change of heart: if a surrogate changes her mind and decides to keep the child, the intended mother has no claim to the child even if it is her genetic offspring, and the couple cannot get back any money they may have paid or reimbursed to the surrogate; if the intended parents change their mind and do not want the child after all, the surrogate cannot get any reimbursement for expenses, or any promised payment, and she will be left with legal custody of the child.

Jurisdictions that permit surrogacy sometimes offer a way for the intended mother, especially if she is also the genetic mother, to be recognized as the legal mother without going through the process of abandonment and adoption. Often this is via a birth order&lt;ref&gt;Bognar, Tara (November 28, 2011). [http://www.tarabognar.com/birth-orders-an-overview "Birth Orders: An Overview"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423065126/http://www.tarabognar.com/birth-orders-an-overview |date=April 23, 2012 }}. Retrieved December 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in which a court rules on the legal parentage of a child. These orders usually require the consent of all parties involved, sometimes including even the husband of a married gestational surrogate. Most jurisdictions provide for only a post-birth order, often out of an unwillingness to force the surrogate mother to give up parental rights if she changes her mind after the birth.

A few jurisdictions do provide for pre-birth orders, generally in only those cases when the surrogate mother is not genetically related to the expected child. Some jurisdictions impose other requirements in order to issue birth orders: for example, that the intended parents be heterosexual and married to one another. Jurisdictions that provide for pre-birth orders are also more likely to provide for some kind of enforcement of surrogacy contracts.

=== Citizenship ===
The citizenship and legal status of the children resulting from surrogacy arrangements can be problematic. The Hague Conference Permanent Bureau identified the question of citizenship of these children as a "pressing problem" in the Permanent Bureau 2014 Study (Hague Conference Permanent
Bureau, 2014a: 84-94).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=text.display&amp;tid=183|title=HCCH - New site|publisher=hcch.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repub.eur.nl/pub/77402|title=RePub, Erasmus University Repository: Global surrogacy practices|publisher=repub.eur.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, for the child to be a U.S. citizen one or both of the child's genetic parents must be a U.S. citizen. In other words, the only way for the child to acquire U.S. citizenship automatically at birth is if he/she is the biological son or daughter of a U.S. citizen. Further, in some countries, the child will not be a citizen of the country in which he/she is born because the surrogate mother is not legally the parent of said child. This could result in a child being born without citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/english/legal-considerations/us-citizenship-laws-policies/assisted-reproductive-technology.html|title=Important Information for U.S. Citizens Considering the Use of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Abroad|publisher=travel.state.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907004652/http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/english/legal-considerations/us-citizenship-laws-policies/assisted-reproductive-technology.html|archivedate=September 7, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical issues==
Ethical issues that have been raised with regards to surrogacy include the following:&lt;ref&gt;See Tong, Rosemarie (2011). [http://www.iep.utm.edu/surr-par/ "Surrogate Parenting"]. ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* To what extent should society be concerned about exploitation, [[commodification]] or coercion when women are paid to be pregnant and deliver babies, especially in cases where there are large wealth and power differentials between intended parents and surrogates?
* To what extent is it right for society to permit women to make contracts about the use of their bodies? 
** To what extent is it a woman's human right to make contracts regarding the use of her body? 
** Is contracting for surrogacy more like contracting for employment/labor, or more like an abusive or exploitative contractual relationship, for example where one party donates a kidney or otherwise gives up a fundamental right? 
** Which, if any, of these kinds of contracts should be enforceable? 
** Should the state be able to force a woman to carry out "specific performance" of her contract if that requires her to give birth to an embryo she would like to abort, or to abort an embryo she would like to carry to term?
* What does motherhood mean? 
** What is the relationship between genetic motherhood, gestational motherhood, and social motherhood? 
** Is it possible to socially or legally conceive of multiple modes of motherhood or the recognition of multiple mothers?
* Should a child born via surrogacy have the right to know the identity of any or all of the people involved in that child's conception and delivery?

==Religious issues==
{{see also|Religious response to assisted reproductive technology}}
Different religions take different approaches to surrogacy, often related to their stances on assisted reproductive technology in general.

===Catholicism===
Paragraph 2376 of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|Catechism]] of the [[Catholic Church]] states that: "Techniques that entail the dissociation of husband and wife, by the intrusion of a person other than the couple (donation of sperm or ovum, surrogate uterus), are gravely immoral."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2376.htm "Paragraph 2376"]. Catechism of the Catholic Church.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
Jewish legal scholars debate this issue. Some contend that parenthood is determined by the woman giving birth while others opt to consider the genetic parents the legal parents.&lt;ref&gt;Hakirah vol. 16 Gestational Surrogacy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray Matter, Jachter, Howard pp. 104-117&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jewish religious establishments have accepted surrogacy only if it is full gestational surrogacy with both intended parents' gametes included and fertilization done via IVF.&lt;ref&gt;Schenker, J.

Jain scholars have not debated the issue. In the Shvetambara tradition of Jainism, the embryo of Lord Mahavira was transferred from a Brahmin woman Devananada to the womb of Trishala, the queen of Kshatriya ruler Siddharth, by a divinity named [[Naigamesha|Harinegameshin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/131608.html?mulR=6275  Harinegameshin Transfers Mahavira's Embryo, Philadelphia Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; The account is not present in the Digambara Jain texts.

=== Surrogate ===
A study by the Family and Child Psychology Research Centre at [[City University London]] in 2002 concluded that surrogate mothers rarely had difficulty relinquishing rights to a surrogate child and that the intended mothers showed greater warmth to the child than mothers conceiving naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=MacCallum, F. |author2=Lycett, E. |author3=Murray, C. |author4=Jadva, V. |author5=Golombok, S. | title = Surrogacy: the experience of commissioning couples | journal = [[Human Reproduction (journal)|Human Reproduction]] | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 1334–42 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12773469 | doi=10.1093/humrep/deg253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Although surrogate mothers generally report being satisfied with their experience as surrogates, there are cases in which they are not. Unmet expectations are associated with dissatisfaction. Some women did not feel a certain level of closeness with the couple and others did not feel respected by the couple.&lt;ref name="Ciccarelli 21–43"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ciccarelli|first=Janice|author2=Beckman, Linda |title=Navigating Rough Waters: An Overview of Psychological Aspects of Surrogacy|journal= [[Journal of Social Issues]] |date=March 2005|volume=61|issue=1|pages=21–43|url=http://wx2mz2qh4l.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Navigating+Rough+Waters%3A+An+Overview+of+Psychological+Aspects+of+Surrogacy&amp;rft.jtitle=The+Journal+of+Social+Issues&amp;rft.au=Janice+C+Ciccarelli&amp;rft.au=Linda+J+Beckman&amp;rft.date=2005&amp;rft.pub=Blackwell+Publishing+Ltd&amp;rft.issn=0022-4537&amp;rft.eissn=1540-4560&amp;rft.volume=61&amp;rft.issue=1&amp;rft.spage=21&amp;rft.externalDocID=807662321&amp;paramdict=en-US|accessdate= December 13, 2013|doi=10.1111/j.0022-4537.2005.00392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women experience emotional distress as a surrogate mother. There may be a lack of access to therapy and emotional support through the surrogate process.&lt;ref name="Ciccarelli 21–43"/&gt;

At age two, parents through surrogacy showed more positive mother–child relationships and less parenting stress on the part of fathers than their natural conception counterparts; there were no differences in child development between these two groups.  At age seven, the surrogacy and egg donation families showed less positive mother–child interaction than the natural conception families, but there were no differences in maternal positive or negative attitudes or child adjustment. The researchers concluded that the surrogacy families continued to function well.

==Surrogacy laws worldwide==
{{main|Surrogacy laws by country}}

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], all jurisdictions except the [[Northern Territory]] allow altruistic surrogacy, but commercial surrogacy is a [[criminal offense]]. The Northern Territory has no legislation governing surrogacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcm.nt.gov.au/strong_service_delivery/supporting_government/register_of_legislation dcm.nt.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt; In New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory it is an offence to enter into [http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/36a_surrogacy.htm international commercial surrogacy] arrangements, with potential penalties extending to imprisonment for up to one year in Australian Capital Territory, up to two years in New South Wales and up to three years in Queensland.

===Belgium===
Altruistic surrogacy was legalized in [[Belgium]].

===Canada===
The [[Assisted Human Reproduction Act]] (AHRC) permits only altruistic surrogacy: surrogate mothers may be reimbursed for approved expenses but payment of any other consideration or fee is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-13.4/index.html Assisted Human Reproduction Act], 6(1), 12(1)c, 12(2), 12(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
Altruistic surrogacy was legalized in [[Denmark]].

=== European Union ===
Gainful surrogacy is made illegal by the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]], whose Article 3 states that "making the human body and its parts as such a source of financial gain" is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/charter/pdf/text_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===

Surrogacy has been illegal since law amendment in 2007. Children born abroad for Finnish parents by surrogacy will not be entitled to get Finnish Citizenship.

=== Germany ===
All surrogacy arrangements (both commercial and altruistic) are illegal. German party [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] wants to allow altruistic surrogacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fdp.de/forderung/121-2 FDP.de: Eizellspenden und Leihmutterschaft unter Auflagen (german)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
Law 3305/2005 (“Enforcement of Medically Assisted Reproduction”) makes surrogacy in Greece fully legal. Greece is only one of a handful of countries in the world to give legal protection to intended parents. Intended parents must meet certain qualifications and will go before a family judge before entering into a surrogacy contract. As long as they meet the qualifications, the court appearance is procedural and their application will be granted. At present, intended parents must be in a heterosexual partnership or be a single female. Females must be able to prove there is a medical indication they cannot carry and be no older than 50 at the time of the contract. As in all jurisdictions, surrogates must pass medical and psychological tests so they can prove to the court that they are medically and mentally fit. Greece is the only country in Europe, and one of only countries in the world, where the surrogate then has no rights over the child. The intended parents become the legal parents from conception, and there is no mention of the surrogate mother anywhere on hospital or birth documents. The intended parent(s) are listed as the parents. This even applies if an egg or sperm donor is used by one of the partners. As a result of the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen Treaty]], intended parents from throughout Europe can freely travel home as soon as the baby is born and deal with citizenship issues at that time, as opposed to applying at their own embassy in Greece. Before 2014 (pursuant to art. 8 of Law 3089/2002), the surrogate mother and the commissioning parents were required to be Greek citizens or permanent residents. However, in July 2014, L. 4272/2014 extended legal surrogacy to applicants or surrogate mothers who have either permanent or temporary residence in Greece.


=== Ireland ===
There is no law in Ireland governing surrogacy. In 2005 a Government appointed Commission published a comprehensive report on Assisted Human Reproduction, which made many recommendations on the broader area of assisted human reproduction. In relation to surrogacy it recommended that the commissioning couple would under Irish law be regarded as the parents of the child. Despite the publication there has been no legislation published, and the area essentially remains unregulated. Due to mounting pressure from Irish citizens going abroad to have children through surrogacy, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence published guidelines for them on 21 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thailand-surrogacy-law.com/ireland-and-surrogacy-thailand/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812193832/http://www.thailand-surrogacy-law.com/ireland-and-surrogacy-thailand/ |archivedate=August 12, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
Gestational surrogacy is currently practiced in Nigeria by a few IVF clinics, under practice guidelines from the Association of Fertility and Reproductive Health of Nigeria. An assisted reproduction technology regulation being considered by the Senate permits surrogacy and allows payments for transport and other expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Abiola Adewusi, Chizara Okeke, Kemi Ailoje and Oladapo A. Ashiru, The 6th Conference of GIERAF Cote Dé Ivoire, February 7–10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
In 2016, gestational surrogacy was legalized in Portugal. Discussions on the adoption of this law lasted more than 3 years. The first version of the law was adopted May 13, 2016, but the president vetoed it. He demanded that the law specify the rights and obligations of all participants.

Portugal allows surrogacy only for those couples in which the woman cannot carry and give birth to a child for medical reasons. Only altruistic surrogacy is permitted. A written agreement must be issued between the surrogate mother and the genetic parents. The rights and obligations of the parties as well as their actions in cases of force majeure should be included in it. After the birth, parental rights over the child belong to the genetic parents.

Traditional surrogacy (in which the surrogate is a genetic parent) is illegal in Portugal.

Heterosexual and lesbian couples can become parents via surrogacy in Portugal under the 2016 law. Male homosexual couples and single men and women of any sexual orientation have not yet been included, but they are not addressed specifically. A revision to include them is on the current manifestos of the [[Left Bloc]], [[People–Animals–Nature]], and [[Ecologist Party "The Greens"|The Greens)]]. The right-wing party [[CDS – People's Party|CDS-PP]] and the [[Portuguese Communist Party]] are opposed.

=== South Africa ===
The [[Children's Act, 2005|South Africa Children's Act of 2005]] (which came fully into force in 2010) enabled the "commissioning parents" and the surrogate to have their surrogacy agreement validated by the [[High Courts of South Africa|High Court]] even before fertilization. This allows the commissioning parents to be recognized as legal parents from the outset of the process and helps prevent uncertainty. If the surrogate mother is the genetic mother, however, she has until 60 days after the birth of the child to change her mind. The law permits single people and gay couples to be commissioning parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_116639.asp Christie, Annabel], "South Africa shows a way to ensure more predictability in surrogacy arrangements," BioNews, January 9, 2012. Retrieved 1-11-2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, only those domiciled in [[South Africa]] benefit from the protection of the law, no non-validated agreements will be enforced, and agreements must be altruistic rather than commercial. If there is only one commissioning parent, s/he must be genetically related to the child. If there are two, they must both be genetically related to the child unless that is physically impossible due to infertility or sex (as in the case of a same sex couple). The commissioning parent or parents must be physically unable to birth a child independently. The surrogate mother must have had at least one pregnancy and viable delivery and have at least one living child. The surrogate mother has the right to unilaterally terminate the pregnancy, but she must consult with and inform the commissioning parents, and if she is terminating for a non-medical reason, may be obliged to refund any medical reimbursements she had received.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2005-038%20childrensact.pdf South Africa Children's Act of 2005], Chapter 19 (ss292-303). Retrieved 1-11-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
The Spanish Human Assisted Reproductive Technologies Act of 2006 made surrocagy arrangements, either commercial or altruistic, null and void. Thus, the intended mother won't be recognised as such; the woman who gives birth will be the legal mother. On the other hand, the biological father will have an action to claim his paternity, by acknowledgment or judicial claim. Despite the aforementioned, surrogacy arrangements made abroad are recognised by Spanish authorities in some circumstances.

On june 2017, the political party [[Ciudadanos]] registered a bill in the [[Congress of the Deputies]] to legalise altruistic surrogacy. Any other political party supports this idea.

===Sweden===
Altruistic surrogacy remains illegal in [[Sweden]].

=== United Kingdom ===
Commercial surrogacy arrangements are not legal in the [[United Kingdom]]. Such arrangements were prohibited by the [[Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3562435 |author=Brahams D |title=The hasty British ban on commercial surrogacy |jstor=3562435 |journal=Hastings Cent Rep |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=16–9 |date=February 1987 |pmid=3557939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst it is illegal in the UK to pay more than expenses for a surrogacy, the relationship is recognised under section 30 of the [[Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990]]. Regardless of contractual or financial consideration for expenses, surrogacy arrangements are not legally enforceable so a surrogate mother maintains the legal right of determination for the child, even if they are genetically unrelated. Unless a parental order or adoption order is made, the surrogate mother remains the legal mother of the child.

===United States===

Surrogacy and its attendant legal issues fall under state jurisdiction and the legal situation for surrogacy varies greatly from state to state.  Some states have written legislation, while others have developed common law regimes for dealing with surrogacy issues. Some states facilitate surrogacy and surrogacy contracts, others simply refuse to enforce them, and some penalize commercial surrogacy. Surrogacy-friendly states tend to enforce both commercial and altruistic surrogacy contracts and facilitate straightforward ways for the intended parents to be recognized as the child's legal parents. Some relatively surrogacy-friendly states offer support only for married heterosexual couples. Generally, only gestational surrogacy is supported and traditional surrogacy finds little to no legal support.

States generally considered to be surrogacy friendly include [[California]],&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1522&amp;context=ggulrev&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oregon]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oregonlive.com/kiddo/index.ssf/2015/04/surrogacy_in_oregon.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illinois]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaml.org/sites/default/files/Illinois%20Becomes%20Surrogacy%20Friendly.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arkansas]],&lt;ref&gt;Arkansas Democrat Gazette, Sunday, August 5, 2007, reproduced on [http://simplesurrogacy.com/news/65-surrogates-families-find-state-eases-way.html Simple Surrogacy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929005109/http://www.simplesurrogacy.com/news/65-surrogates-families-find-state-eases-way.html |date=September 29, 2011 }} [http://surrogate-mother.net/surrogates-families-find-state-eases-way "Restored version Arkansas Democrat Gazette"].

For legal purposes, key factors are where the contract is completed, where the surrogate mother resides, and where the birth takes place. Therefore, individuals living in a non-friendly state can still benefit from the policies of surrogacy friendly states by working with a surrogate who lives and will give birth in a friendly state.


==Fertility tourism==
{{main|Fertility tourism}}
[[Fertility tourism]] for surrogacy is driven by legal regulations in the home country or lower price abroad.

===India===
{{Further|Commercial surrogacy in India}}
[[India]] is a main destination for surrogacy. Indian surrogates have been increasingly popular with intended parents in industrialized nations because of the relatively low cost. Clinics charge patients between $10,000 and $28,000 for the complete package, including fertilization, the surrogate's fee, and delivery of the baby at a hospital. Including the costs of flight tickets, medical procedures and hotels, it comes to roughly a third of the price compared with going through the procedure in the UK.&lt;ref name=kannan&gt;Kannan, Shilpa. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7935768.stm "Regulators Eye India's Surrogacy Sector"]. India Business Report, BBC World. Retrieved March 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Surrogacy in India is of low cost and the laws are flexible. In 2008, the [[Supreme Court of India]] in the Manji's case (Japanese Baby) has held that commercial surrogacy is permitted in India. That has increased the international confidence in surrogacy arrangements in India. As of 2014, however, surrogacy by homosexual couples and single parents was banned {{citation needed|date=June 2017}}.

There is an upcoming Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill, aimed at regulating the surrogacy business. It may increase parent confidence in clinics by eliminating dubious practitioners, and in this way stimulate the practice.&lt;ref name=kannan/&gt;

=== Russian Federation ===
Liberal legislation makes [[Russia]] attractive for those looking for techniques not available in their countries. Intended parents come there for oocyte donation, because of advanced age or marital status (single women and single men), and when surrogacy is considered. Commercial gestational surrogacy is legal in Russia, being available to almost all adults willing to be parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurconsult.ru/publications/reproductiveBioMed.pdf|title=jurconsult.ru|format=PDF|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners have the same rights to assisted reproduction as Russian citizens. Within three days after the birth, the commissioning parents obtain a Russian [[birth certificate]] with both their names on it. Genetic relation to the child (in case of donation) is not a factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stuyver|first1=I.|last2=De Sutter|first2=P.|last3=Svitnev|first3=K.|last4=Taylor|first4=K.|last5=Haimes|first5=E.|last6=Sills|first6=E.

=== Ukraine ===
Surrogacy is legal in Ukraine. Only healthy women who have had children before can become surrogates. Surrogates in Ukraine have no parental rights over the child, as stated on Article 123 of the Family Code of Ukraine. Thus, a surrogate cannot refuse to hand the baby over if she changes her mind after birth. Only married couples can legally go through gestational surrogacy in Ukraine.

===United States===
People come to the US for surrogacy procedures for the high quality of medical technology and care, as well as the high level of legal protections afforded through some US state courts to surrogacy contracts as compared to many other countries. Single men or male couples who face restrictions using IVF and surrogacy procedures in their home countries may travel to US states with favorable legal climates. The United States is occasionally sought as a location for surrogate mothers by couples seeking a [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] in the U.S., since the resulting child can get [[birthright citizenship in the United States]] and can thereby apply for green cards for the parents when the child turns 21 years of age.&lt;ref name="Harney2013"&gt;Harney, Alexandra (September 23, 2013).

[[File:Sri Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirthaji Maharaj.gif|thumb]]
His Holiness Sri Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirthaji Maharaj &lt;ref&gt;http://www.narayan-sanskriti-kendra.com/about-us.html&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 1889 in the Vikramapar division of Dacca district which belonged to the [[Bengal province]] of undivided India. He was originally called Rohini Kumar Chattopadhaya. His father was a highly devoted orthodox [[brahmin]]. Even as a child he was drawn to the spiritual path of [[yoga]]; the path of love. after His student years, at age 18 He joined the freedom movement, but always found time to worship the great saint [[Sri Ramakrishna Paramhansa]] in His heart. However meditation developed a building spiritual urge, and a lessening of interest in fighting.

One day while worshiping before a picture of Sri Ramakrishnaji He earnestly beseeched Ramakrishna's blessings to find a competent guru who would be friend, philosopher and spiritual guide on his path to achieve moksha, the ultimate destination of one's spiritual journey. Suddenly the figure of Ramakrishna transformed into a new ascetic whom He had never seen before. His desire to find a guru became so paramount that He was always in a state of agony and torment. One day a friend invited Him to a nearby village where, to his great astonishment, he saw the very ascetic from the picture.

The saint's name was Swami Narayan Dev Tirtha Ji Maharaj. The yogin also behaved as if they already knew each other. They spent the night in meditation with other followers and in no time, He was submerged in an ocean of spiritual ecstasy and inexplicable joy and happiness. He realized that he had found his guru. He spent the next eight years as a [[Brahmacharya|brahmachari]]. Expressing to Narayan Dev Tirtha His interest in becoming a Dundar Swami (traditional), He was sent to meet Jagadguruji, Sri Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha Maharaja where he was initiated into [[Sannyasa]] (order of renunciates).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swaminarayantirtha.org/lineage.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha descended from two monastic lines. He was first initiated into Siddhayoga by Swami Narayana Dev Tirtha [born circa 1879], whose own spiritual lineage was through Swami Gangadhara Tirtha. Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha then took sannyas under Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Bharati Krsna Tirtha in Puri. 

During Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Bharati Krsna Tirthaji's visit to America, Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha was asked to maintain the holy seat of Shankaracharya of Puri Govardhan Mutt. Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirthaji was not keen to be bound by the obligations pertaining to the office of Shankaracharya, including administrative responsibilities. His greater objective was to spread the thought of God among all people. As a result, brushing aside the honour of and fascination for the position of Shankaracharya, he set out, proceeding to the north in the direction of the Himalayas, always an attraction to yogis, seers, and sages as the ideal place for sadhana. The king of Tehri Garhwal, appreciative of the blessings he received from Swamiji, expressed his desire to donate a vast stretch of land by the Ganga, but Swamiji accepted only a modest plot after repeated entreaties of the king. Thus, the ashrama named "Shankar Math" Uttarkashi was established in 1933. Later, another Math in Varanasi's Chhoti Gaibi, named "Siddhayogashram" was founded in 1934. Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha wrote several books such as Yogavani, Japa Sadhana (available in Hindi and Bengali),Yoga Vani: Instructions for the Attainment of Siddhayoga (available in Bengali, Hindi and English)and Guruvani which were originally written in Bengali, later translated into Hindi. He also wrote a short treatise in English, entitled Who Am I?[8]
 
His Holiness installed Swami Narayan Tirtha as the head of the Siddhayogashram. His Holiness Sri Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirthaji Maharaj left his mortal body in 1958 at Calcutta.

Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha [1888-1958] was the guru of Swami Narayana Tirtha [ -2001]. Swami Vishnu Tirtha was another disciple of Swami Shankar Purushottam Tirtha. He was initiated in 1939.[9] Swami Shivom Tirtha, a disciple of Swami Vishnu Tirtha,[10] has a website dedicated to him that explains the Tirtha Siddhayoga lineage tree in more detail.[11]

The Tirtha lineage of Jagadguru Shankaracharya Swami Bharati Krsna Tirtha [1884-1960] traces itself back to Sri Adi Shankaracharya. In legend the lineage (parampara) began when Lord Narayana passed the eternal Vedic wisdom to Brahma, Brahma to Vasishtha, onto Shakti, to Parashara, to Veda Vyasa, and to Shuka. Thus far the lineage was from father to son. From Shuka it was passed on from guru to shishya, to Patanjali, then to Gaudapada, Govinda, Chandra Sharma and so to Adi Shankara. This began the tradition of wandering monks. Vyasa told Govinda of the advent of the incarnation of Shiva as Adi Shankara, to meet and give him sanyas diksha, Shankara's purpose in incarnating was to comment on the Brahma Sutras.[12] Shankaracharya set up four religious seats in the north, south, east and west of India to act as a lighthouse to guide religious seekers towards the truth for the millennia to come and also set up the ten monastic orders. 1) Tirtha, 2) Ashrama, 3) Vana, 4) Aranya, 5) Giri, 6) Parvata, 7) Sagara, 8) Saraswati, 9) Bharati, 10) Puri.[13]

'''"The Analytical Language of John Wilkins"''' (Spanish: ''El idioma analítico de John Wilkins'') is a short essay by Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] originally published in ''Otras Inquisiciones (1937–1952)''.&lt;ref name="otras"&gt;{{cite book|last=Borges|first=Jorge Luis|title=Otras Inquisiciones (1937–1952)|year=1952|publisher=Sur|location=Buenos Aires, Argentina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="otrasenglish"&gt;{{cite book|last=Borges|first=Jorge Luis|title=Other Inquisitions (1937–1952)|translator=Ruth L. C. Simms|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|year=1964|location=Austin, TX}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a critique of the English natural philosopher and writer [[John Wilkins]]'s proposal for a [[universal language]] and of the representational capacity of language generally. In it, Borges imagines a bizarre and whimsical (and fictional) Chinese [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] later quoted by [[Michel Foucault]], [[David Byrne]], and others.&lt;ref name=pic/&gt;&lt;ref name=merrell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merrell|first1=Floyd|title=Unthinking thinking: Jorge Luis Borges, mathematics, and the new physics|date=1991|publisher=[[Purdue University Press]]|location=West Lafayette, Ind.|isbn=1557530114|page=xiii|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1557530114|accessdate=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Borges begins by noting John Wilkins's absence from the 14th edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and makes the case for Wilkins's significance, highlighting in particular the universal language scheme detailed in his ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language]]'' (1668). Wilkins's system decomposes the entire universe of "things and notions" into successively smaller divisions and subdivisions, assigning at each step of this decomposition a syllable, consonant, or vowel. Wilkins intended for these conceptual building blocks to be recombined to represent anything on earth or in heaven. The basic example Borges gives is "''de'', which means an element; ''deb'', the first of the elements, fire; ''deba'', a part of the element of fire, a flame."&lt;ref name="englishvazquez"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Analytical Language of John Wilkins|last=Borges|first=Jorge Luis|translator=Lilia Graciela Vázquez|url=https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/155/assignment/ex1/Borges.pdf|publisher=Alamut: Bastion of Peace and Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jorge Luis Borges 1951, by Grete Stern.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Borges in 1951 (photo by Grete Stern)]]

Examining this and other second-hand examples from Wilkins's scheme{{mdashb}}he did not have access to Wilkins's actual work, but based his comments on ''others''' comments on it{{mdashb}}Borges believes he finds "ambiguities, redundancies and deficiencies", concluding "it is clear that there is no classification of the Universe not being arbitrary and full of conjectures."&lt;ref name="englishvazquez"/&gt; He fancifully likens Wilkins's classification scheme to a "certain Chinese encyclopedia," likely fictitious, but attributed to [[Franz Kuhn]], called the ''[[Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge]]'', said to divide animals into "(a){{nbsp}}those that belong to the Emperor, (b){{nbsp}}embalmed ones, (c){{nbsp}}those that are trained, (d){{nbsp}}suckling pigs, (e){{nbsp}}mermaids, (f){{nbsp}}fabulous ones, (g){{nbsp}}stray dogs, (h){{nbsp}}those that are included in the present classification, (i){{nbsp}}those that tremble as if they are mad, (j){{nbsp}}innumerable ones, (k){{nbsp}}those drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, (l){{nbsp}}others, (m){{nbsp}}those that have just broken a flower vase, (n){{nbsp}}those that look like flies from a long way off." Borges's point is the arbitrary nature of such taxonomies, regardless of whether they form a language or just a way of understanding and ordering the world. He challenges the idea of the universe as something we can understand at all{{mdashb}}"we do not know what thing the universe is"&lt;ref name="englishvazquez"/&gt;{{mdashb}}much less describe using language.

While considering Wilkins's effort naïve, Borges ultimately praises the ambition of a universal language and admits that Wilkins's word for salmon, ''zana'', could (for someone well-versed in Wilkins's language) hold more meaning than the corresponding words in conventional languages, which are arbitrary and carry no intrinsic meaning. He says that, "Theoretically, it is not impossible to think of a language where the name of each thing says all the details of its destiny, past and future."

==Commentary and uses by others==

[[Michel Foucault]] attributes the inspiration for his ''[[The Order of Things]]'' to Borges' "Celestial Emporium" passage and "the laughter that shattered, as I read the passage, all the familiar landmarks of my thought ... breaking up all the ordered surfaces and all the planes with which we are accustomed to tame the wild profusion of existing things..."&lt;ref name="foucaultorder"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences|translator=C. Gordon|last=Foucault|first=Michel|year=1994|location=New York, NY|publisher=[[Random House]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault is disturbed less by the ''Emporium's'' arbitrariness than by the idea that such a classification might be intelligible to someone or some culture,&lt;ref name=osullivan&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Sullivan|first=Gerry|editor=Edna Aizenberg|title=The Library Is on Fire: Intertextuality in Borges and Foucault|work=Borges and His Successors: The Borgesian Impact on Literature and the Arts|year=1990|publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]]|location=Columbia, MO}}&lt;/ref&gt; then discusses the ways cultures make sense of the world by drawing relationships between things, expressed through language. What Borges did, according to Foucault, was to highlight the importance of the "site" of order by taking it away, asking in what context the ''Celestial Emporium'' might make sense.&lt;ref name="foucaultorder"/&gt;

The ''Emporium'' has often been used as a shorthand for the subversion of traditional, [[rationality|rational]] notions of order.&lt;ref name=postmoderngenres&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

'''''The Ister''''' is a 2004 [[documentary film]] directed by David Barison and [[Daniel Ross (philosopher)|Daniel Ross]].

The film is loosely based on the works of philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], in particular the 1942 lecture course he delivered, ''[[Hölderlin's Hymn "The Ister"|Hölderlins Hymne «Der Ister»]]'', concerning a poem, ''Der Ister'', by the German poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]].

The film had its premiere at the [[International Film Festival Rotterdam]] in 2004.

== Sources ==
''The Ister'' was inspired by a 1942 lecture course delivered by the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], published in 1984 as ''[[Hölderlin's Hymn "The Ister"|Hölderlins Hymne «Der Ister»]]''. Heidegger's lecture course concerns a poem by the German poet [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] about the [[Danube River]].

The film ''The Ister'' travels upstream along the Danube toward its [[source (river or stream)|source]], as several interviewees discuss Heidegger, Hölderlin, and [[philosophy]]. The film is also concerned with a number of other themes, including: [[time]], [[poetry]], [[technology]], [[home]], [[war]], [[politics]], [[myth]], [[National Socialism]], the [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]], the ancient Greek [[polis]], [[Sophocles]], ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'', [[Agnes Bernauer]], [[Edmund Husserl]], the 1991 [[battle of Vukovar]], and the 1999 [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].

== Interviewees ==
''The Ister'' features extensive interviews with the French philosophers [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], and [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], as well as with the German film director [[Hans-Jürgen Syberberg]]. Other interviews are conducted with a bridge engineer (Nemanja Calic), an amateur botanist (Tobias Maier), and a Romanian archaeologist ([[:Ro:Alexandru Suceveanu|Alexandru Suceveanu]]).

An extended interview with philosopher [[Werner Hamacher]] is also included as one of the "extra features" on the DVD.

== Locations ==
The film travels upriver: from the [[Danube Delta]], opening onto the [[Black Sea]] in [[Romania]], to the source of the river in the [[Black Forest]] of southern [[Germany]], moving along the way through the [[Histria (Sinoe)]] archaeological site, through [[Novi Sad]] in [[Serbia]], [[Vukovar]] in [[Croatia]], [[Budapest]], [[Dunaföldvár]], and [[Dunaújváros]] in [[Hungary]], and [[Vienna]] and the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] in [[Austria]]. Also featured are the [[Walhalla temple]] near [[Regensburg]], the [[Befreiungshalle]] at [[Kelheim]], the tomb of [[Agnes Bernauer]], and the [[Schloss Sigmaringen|castle]] at [[Sigmaringen]] to which [[Philippe Pétain|Marshal Pétain]] fled in 1945.

Notable places from Heidegger's own life which feature in the film include his birthplace in [[Meßkirch]], his hut at [[Todtnauberg]], and the lecture theatre at [[Freiburg University]] where he delivered his infamous ''Rectoratsrede'' ([[Rector (academia)|rectorial]] address).&lt;ref&gt;[https://webspace.utexas.edu/hcleaver/www/330T/350kPEEHeideggerSelf-Assertion.pdf "The Self-Assertion of the German University"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404150727/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hcleaver/www/330T/350kPEEHeideggerSelf-Assertion.pdf |date=4 April 2012 }}, text of Martin Heidegger inaugural rectorial speech, Freiburg University, 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually the film arrives at [[Donaueschingen]], and at the [[Breg River|Breg]] and the [[Brigach]], the two tributaries whose confluence marks the point at which the river becomes known as the Danube. The film then travels upstream along the Breg, past [[Vöhrenbach]] and [[Furtwangen]], in search of the "true" mountain source of the Danube.

== Structure ==
''The Ister'' is divided into five chapters, plus a prologue and epilogue:
*'''Prologue. The myth of Prometheus, or The birth of technics'''. Bernard Stiegler tells the myth of Prometheus.
*'''Chapter 1. Now come fire!''' "In which the philosopher Bernard Stiegler conjugates technology and time, and guides us from the mouth of the Danube to the city of Vukovar in Croatia."
*'''Chapter 2. Here we wish to build'''. "In which the philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy takes up the question of politics and guides us through the Republic of Hungary."
*'''Chapter 3. When the trial has passed'''. "In which philosopher Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe conducts us from the technopolis of Vienna to the depths of the concentration camp at Mauthausen, confronting Heidegger's most provocative statement concerning technology."
*'''Chapter 4. The rock has need of cuts'''. "In which philosopher Bernard Stiegler returns to guide us deeper into the questions of mortality and history, as we emerge from Mauthausen to the Hall of Liberation in Germany."
*'''Chapter 5. What that river does, no-one knows'''. "In which the German artist and director Hans-Jürgen Syberberg guides us through the upper Danube, to the source of the river and beyond."
*'''Epilogue. Heidegger reads Hölderlin'''. Heidegger reads Hölderlin's hymn, "''Der Ister''."

== Soundtrack ==
Three excerpts from classical works feature in the film:
*[[Anton Bruckner]], ''[[Symphony No. 4 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 4 in E-flat major]]'', first movement.
*[[Richard Wagner]], "Siegfried's Funeral March," from ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'', Act 3.
*[[Franz Schubert]], ''[[Impromptus (Schubert)|Impromptu D. 899 (Op. 90), No. 1 in C minor]]''.

== Premiere and awards ==
''The Ister'' premiered at the [[International Film Festival Rotterdam]] on 23 January 2004. It has won two awards:
*The ''Prix du Groupement National des Cinémas de Recherche (GNCR)'' at the [[Marseille Festival of Documentary Film|Festival International du Documentaire de Marseille]] (August 2004).
*The [http://www.theister.com/news.html ''Prix de l’AQCC (Association Québécoise des Critiques/Quebec Association of Film Critics)''] at the ''[[Festival du Nouveau Cinéma]]'' in [[Montreal]] (October 2004).

'''The Kindness Offensive''' ('''TKO''') is a group based in [[London]] known for orchestrating large-scale [[random acts of kindness]], involving the distribution of industrial quantities of goods to unsuspecting members of the public and charities. The group's stated purpose is to "Practice random kindness and senseless acts of beauty", a phrase first coined by [[Anne Herbert (writer)|Anne Herbert]].

==History==
The Kindness Offensive was formed in August 2008, when three of the four founding members (David Goodfellow, Benny Crane and James Hunter) asked members of the public in [[Hampstead]] what "[[random acts of kindness]]" they would like done for them. They received many requests from the public, and the group attempted to meet some of them by contacting companies and persuading them to donate the required goods for free, a technique developed by fourth founding member Robert Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jochan Embley |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/independent-on-sundays-happy-list-2014-not-the-rich-list-robert-williams-kindness-giver-9430850.html |title=Independent on Sunday's Happy List 2014 (NOT the Rich List): Robert Williams, kindness giver - News - People |publisher=The Independent |date=2014-05-25 |accessdate=2014-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to by the group as "phone whispering".

TKO attracted press attention in October 2008 for giving away twenty-five tonnes of non-perishable foods to fourteen soup kitchens and drop-in centres across London England; the event came to be known as 'The Mountain of Food'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7657122.stm |title=England &amp;#124; 'Kindness offensive' begins |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-10-07 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was the first of many large-scale events centred on distributing industrial quantities of goods in short periods of time to a wide variety of locations and causes; the most notable of these were The Vinspired Kindness Offensive (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/7796092.stm |title=England &amp;#124; Hampers at the ready |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuOa8kQDud0 |title=An act of kindness |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White Stuff Kindness Offensive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4ZJcmFCKfY |title=A festive kindness offensive |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-12-22 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was widely reported as a record-breaking event (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHuWuOqYYC4 |title=A hundred volunteers &amp; ONE dog |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Barclaycard Kindness Offensive (2011) the Hasbro Kindness Offensive (2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvB-6nIyItk |title=Kids show true Christmas spirit |publisher=YouTube |date=2013-12-16 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Read Free!

As well as large giveaways, TKO has also staged a series of pop-up events, including The Everyday Kindness Awards in 2009. Over the course of a weekend, actors in public places pretended to need help, and when members of the public stepped up to offer a hand, they received a pop-up celebration rewarding their kindness with champagne, flowers and a gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8201806.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; London &amp;#124; Project rewards acts of kindness |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Handshake (Workshop Cologne '06).jpeg|thumb|In Western business cultures, a [[handshake]] when meeting someone is a signal of initial cooperation.]]

'''Tit for tat''' is an English saying meaning "equivalent [[retaliation]]". It is also a highly effective [[strategy]] in [[game theory]] for the [[iterated prisoner's dilemma]]. The strategy was first introduced by [[Anatol Rapoport]] in [[Robert Axelrod]]'s two tournaments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawrules.wordpress.com/2011/09/05/the-axelrod-tournaments/ The Axelrod Tournaments]&lt;/ref&gt; held around 1980. Notably, it was (on both occasions) both the [[simplest]] strategy and the most successful in direct competition.

The phrase originally came from another phrase "tip for tap", first used in 1558.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Game theory: a critical text|author=Shaun Hargreaves Heap, [[Yanis Varoufakis]]|page=191|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0-415-25094-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[intelligent agent|agent]] using this strategy will first cooperate, then subsequently replicate an opponent's previous action. If the opponent previously was cooperative, the agent is cooperative. If not, the agent is not. This is similar to [[superrationality]] and [[reciprocal altruism]] in [[biology]].

== Implications ==
The success of the tit-for-tat strategy, which is largely cooperative despite that its name emphasizes an adversarial nature, took many by surprise. Arrayed against strategies produced by various teams it won in two competitions. After the first competition, new strategies formulated specifically to combat tit-for-tat failed due to their negative interactions with each other; a successful strategy other than tit-for-tat would have had to be formulated with both tit-for-tat and itself in mind.

This result may give insight into how groups of animals (and particularly human societies) have come to live in largely (or entirely) cooperative societies, rather than the individualistic "[[In Memoriam A.H.H.#Nature, red in tooth and claw|red in tooth and claw]]" way that might be expected from individuals engaged in a [[Hobbes]]ian state of nature. This, and particularly its application to human society and politics, is the subject of [[Robert Axelrod]]'s book ''[[The Evolution of Cooperation]]''.

Moreover, the tit-for-tat strategy has been of beneficial use to social psychologists and sociologists in studying effective techniques to reduce conflict. Research has indicated that when individuals who have been in competition for a period of time no longer trust one another, the most effective competition reverser is the use of the tit-for-tat strategy. Individuals commonly engage in behavioral assimilation, a process in which they tend to match their own behaviors to those displayed by cooperating or competing group members. Therefore, if the tit-for-tat strategy begins with cooperation, then cooperation ensues. On the other hand, if the other party competes, then the tit-for-tat strategy will lead the alternate party to compete as well. Ultimately, each action by the other member is countered with a matching response, competition with competition and cooperation with cooperation.

In the case of conflict resolution, the tit-for-tat strategy is effective for several reasons: the technique is recognized as ''clear'', ''nice'', ''provocable'', and ''forgiving''. Firstly, It is a ''clear'' and recognizable strategy. Those using it quickly recognize its contingencies and adjust their behavior accordingly. Moreover, it is considered to be ''nice'' as it begins with cooperation and only defects in following competitive move. The strategy is also ''provocable'' because it provides immediate retaliation for those who compete. Finally, it is ''forgiving'' as it immediately produces cooperation should the competitor make a cooperative move.

The implications of the tit-for-tat strategy have been of relevance to conflict research, resolution and many aspects of applied social science.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, D.R. (2010) ''Group Dynamics''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems ==
While Axelrod has empirically shown that the strategy is optimal in some cases of direct competition, two agents playing tit for tat remain vulnerable.  A one-time, single-bit error in either player's interpretation of events can lead to an unending "death spiral": if one agent defects and the opponent cooperates, then both agents will end up alternating cooperate and defect, yielding a lower payoff than if both agents were to continually cooperate. This situation frequently arises in real world conflicts, ranging from schoolyard fights to civil and regional wars. The reason for these issues is that tit for tat is not a [[subgame perfect equilibrium]], except under knife-edge conditions on the [[Discounted utility|discount rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | title = Game Theory Evolving
  | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]
  | year = 2000
  | isbn = 0-691-00943-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While this subgame is not directly reachable by two agents playing tit for tat strategies, a strategy must be a [[Nash equilibrium]] in all subgames to be subgame perfect.  Further, this subgame may be reached if any noise is allowed in the agents' signaling.  A subgame perfect variant of tit for tat known as "contrite tit for tat" may be created by employing a basic reputation mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Boyd |first= Robert |title= Mistakes Allow Evolutionary Stability in the Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma Game |journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume = 136 |pages = 47–56 |year = 1989 |doi= 10.1016/S0022-5193(89)80188-2 |pmid= 2779259 |issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tit for two tats could be used to mitigate this problem; see the description below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Dawkins
  | first = Richard
  | title = The Selfish Gene
  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]
  | year = 1989
  | isbn = 978-0-19-929115-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Tit for tat with forgiveness" is a similar attempt to escape the death spiral. When the opponent defects, a player employing this strategy will occasionally cooperate on the next move anyway. The exact probability that a player will respond with cooperation depends on the line-up of opponents.

Furthermore, the tit-for-tat strategy is not proved optimal in situations short of total competition.  For example, when the parties are friends it may be best for the friendship when a player cooperates at every step despite occasional deviations by the other player.  Most situations in the real world are less competitive than the total competition in which the tit-for-tat strategy won its competition.

==Tit for two tats==
'''Tit for two tats''' is similar to tit for tat in that it is nice, retaliating, forgiving and non-envious{{clarify|date=February 2018}}, the only difference between the two being how forgiving the strategy is.

In a tit for tat strategy, once an opponent defects, the tit for tat player immediately responds by defecting on the next move.  This has the unfortunate consequence of causing two retaliatory strategies to continuously defect against each other resulting in a poor outcome for both players.  A tit for two tats player will let the first defection go unchallenged as a means to avoid the "death spiral" of the previous example.  If the opponent defects twice in a row, the tit for two tats player will respond by defecting.

This strategy was put forward by [[Robert Axelrod]] during his second round of computer simulations at [[RAND]].  After analyzing the results of the first experiment, he determined that had a participant entered the tit for two tats strategy it would have emerged with a higher cumulative score than any other program.  As a result, he himself entered it with high expectations in the second tournament.  Unfortunately, owing to the more aggressive nature of the programs entered in the second round, which were able to take advantage of its highly forgiving nature, tit for two tats did significantly worse (in the game-theory sense) than tit for tat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Real-world use==

=== Peer-to-peer file sharing ===
{{See also|BitTorrent_(protocol)#Downloading torrents and sharing files}}

[[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] peers use tit-for-tat strategy to optimize their download speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Bram | last=Cohen |title=Incentives Build Robustness in BitTorrent | publisher=BitTorrent.org | date=2003-05-22 | accessdate=2011-02-05 |url= http://www.bittorrent.org/bittorrentecon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, most BitTorrent peers use a variant of Tit for two Tats which is called ''regular unchoking'' in BitTorrent terminology. BitTorrent peers have a limited number of upload slots to allocate to other peers. Consequently, when a peer's upload bandwidth is saturated, it will use a tit-for-tat strategy. Cooperation is achieved when upload bandwidth is exchanged for download bandwidth. Therefore, when a peer is not uploading in return to our own peer uploading, the BitTorrent program will ''choke'' the connection with the uncooperative peer and allocate this upload slot to a hopefully more cooperating peer. ''Regular unchoking'' corresponds very strongly to always cooperating on the first move in prisoner's dilemma. Periodically, a peer will allocate an upload slot to a randomly chosen uncooperative peer (''unchoke''). This is called ''optimistic unchoking''. This behavior allows searching for more cooperating peers and gives a second chance to previously non-cooperating peers. The optimal threshold values of this strategy are still the subject of research.

===Explaining reciprocal altruism in animal communities===

Studies in the prosocial behaviour of animals have led many ethologists and evolutionary psychologists to apply tit-for-tat strategies to explain why altruism evolves in many animal communities.  Evolutionary game theory, derived from the mathematical theories formalised by [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern|Morgenstern]] (1953), was first devised by [[Maynard Smith]] (1972) and explored further in bird behaviour by [[Robert Hinde]]. Their application of game theory to the evolution of animal strategies launched an entirely new way of analysing animal behaviour.

[[Reciprocal altruism]] works in animal communities where the cost to the benefactor in any transaction of food, mating rights, nesting or territory is less than the gains to the beneficiary. The theory also holds that the act of altruism should be reciprocated if the balance of needs reverse. Mechanisms to identify and punish "cheaters" who fail to reciprocate, in effect a form of tit for tat, are important to regulate reciprocal altruism. For example, tit-for-tat is suggested to be the mechanism of cooperative predator inspection behavior in [[guppy|guppies]].

=== War ===
The tit-for-tat inability of either side to back away from conflict, for fear of being perceived as weak or as cooperating with the enemy, has been the source of many conflicts throughout history.

However, the tit for tat strategy has also been detected by analysts in the spontaneous [[non-violent]] behaviour, called "[[Live and let live (World War I)|live and let live]]" that arose during trench warfare in the [[First World War]]. Troops dug in only a few hundred feet from each other would evolve an unspoken understanding. If a sniper killed a soldier on one side, the other could expect an equal retaliation. Conversely, if no one was killed for a time, the other side would acknowledge this implied "truce" and act accordingly. This created a "separate peace" between the trenches.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Nice Guys Finish First]]''. Richard Dawkins. BBC. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tore Nordenstam''' (born 1934) is a Swedish philosopher, with higher degrees from [[Gothenburg]] (M.A. 1961, fil. lic. 1961) and [[University of Khartoum|the University of Khartoum]] (Ph.D. 1965); he also studied at [[Uppsala]] and [[Oxford]].

Between 1961 and 1998, Nordenstam held teaching positions at the Universities of Khartoum, [[Umeå]], and [[Bergen]]. In Bergen, he was first Reader in Philosophy (1968&amp;ndash;81) and later Professor of Philosophy (1981&amp;ndash;98). He is currently [[Professor|Professor Emeritus]] from Bergen.

In his philosophical career, Nordenstam moved from the [[Analytic philosophy|analytical philosophy]] of language into ethics, aesthetics and the philosophy of the humanities.

Nordenstam has published a number of books, the most important of which are ''Sudanese Ethics'' (Stockholm: The Scandinavian Institute of [[African studies|African Studies]] / Almqvist &amp; Wiksell, 1968) and, much more recently, ''The Power of Example'' (Stockholm: Santörus [[Academic Press]], 2009); the content of the latter appeared earlier in Swedish as ''Exemplets makt'' in ''Dialoger'' 69-70 (Stockholm, 2005). He has also published a goodly number of journal articles, mostly classifiable into the areas mentioned above, and some closely related to his book projects.

A foreign colleague of Nordenstam remarks, “Readers of Nordenstam’s works will find him to be a clear, careful, original and touchingly humanistic thinker, influenced by Wittgenstein and others, but not in thrall to any.”

'''''Zen at War''''' is a book written by [[Brian Victoria|Brian Daizen Victoria]], first published in 1997. The second edition appeared in 2006.

==Contents==
The book meticulously documents [[Zen]] Buddhism's support of [[Japanese militarism]] from the time of the [[Meiji Restoration]] through the [[World War II]] and the post-War period. It describes the influence of state policy on [[Buddhism in Japan]], and particularly the influence of Zen on the military of the [[Empire of Japan]]. A famous quote is from [[Harada Daiun Sogaku]]: "[If ordered to] march: tramp, tramp, or shoot: bang, bang. This is the manifestation of the highest Wisdom [of Enlightenment]. The unity of Zen and war of which I speak extends to the farthest reaches of the holy war [now under way]."{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=xiv}}{{sfn|Tiltenberg|2002|p=41}}

The book also explores the actions of Japanese Buddhists who opposed the growth of militarism.

The 2002 edition of ''Zen at War'' was followed by ''Zen War Stories'', which further explores the intimate relationship between Japanese institutional Buddhism and militarism during World War II.

==Sources==
Victoria draws from his own study of original Japanese documents, but also uses the publications of Ichikawa Hakugen, a [[Rinzai]]-priest and a scholar who taught at [[Hanazono University]] in Tokyo.{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=xiii}} Hakugen's work, in Japanese, include:{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=166}}
* 1967 Zen and Contemporary Thought (Zen to Gendai Shiso)
* 1970 The War Responsibility of Buddhists (Bukkyosha no Senso Sekinin)
* 1975 Religion Under Japanese Fascism (Nihon Fashizumu Ka no Shukyo)
* 1977 Buddhism During the War (Senji Ka no Bukkyo)

Hakugen himself had been "a strong advocate of Japan's 'holy war'": "And I should not forget to include myself as one of those [[Buddhist modernism|modern Japanese Buddhist]] who did these things.{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=170}}"

Hakugen points to twelve characteristics of Japanese Zen which have contributed to its support for Japanese militarism:{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=171-174}}
# Subservience of Buddhism to the state.
# Buddhist views on humanity and society. Though "Buddhism emphasizes the equality of human beings based on their possession of a [[Buddha-nature|Buddha nature]]";{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=171}} the doctrine of [[karma]] has also been used as a "moral justification for social inequality".{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=171}}
# Protection of the state and the hierarchical social structures.
# Emphasis on [[śūnyatā]] and selflessness, "leaving no room for the independence of the individual".{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=172}}
# Lack of Buddhist dogma, which left no "compelling basic dogma a believer would fight to preserve".{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=172-173}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|See [[Karl Barth]]'s ''[[Barmen Declaration]]'' for an example of such a "dogma to fight for".}}
# The concept of ''on'', "the teaching that a debt of gratitude is owed to those from whom favors are received".{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=173}} In the case of Japanese Zen, this gratitude was also owed to the Emperor, as "the head of the entire Japanese family".{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=173}}
# The belief in mutual dependency, which "led in modern Japan to an organic view of the state coupled with a feeling of intimacy towards it".{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=173}}
# The doctrine of the [[Middle Way]], which "took the form of a constant search for compromise with the aim of avoiding confrontation before it occurred".{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=173}}
# The tradition of ancestor veneration, in which "the entire nation came to be regarded as one large family in which loyalty between subject and sovereign was the chief virtue".{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=173}}
# The value given to "old and mature things".{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=174}} Since society was based "on a set of ancient and immutable laws",{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=174}} opposition to this was unacceptable.
# Emphasis on inner peace, which "contributed to its failure to encourage and justify the will to reorganize society".{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=174}}
# The Buddhist logic of ''soku'', "just as it is",{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=174}} which leads to "a static, aesthetic perspective, a detached, subjective harmony with things".{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=174}}

Hakugen saw [[D. T. Suzuki]] as "most responsible for the development of imperial-way Zen",{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=167}} but in no way standing alone in this development.{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=167}} Hakugen traces this development to pre-meiji developments:
{{quote|In the Edo period [1600-1867] Zen priests such as Shidō Bunan [1603-1676], [[Hakuin Ekaku|Hakuin]] [1685-1768], and Torei [1721-1792] attempted to promote the unity of zen and [[Shinto]] by emphasizing Shinto's Zen-like features. While this resulted in the further assimilation of Zen into Japan, it occurred at the same time as the establishment of the power of the emperor system. Ultimately this meant that Zen lost almost all of its independence.{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=169}}}}

==Responses==
The book drew a lot of attention, and mixed responses:
{{quote|Few books in recent years have so deeply influenced the thinking of Buddhists in Japan and elsewhere as Brian Daizen Victoria’s ''Zen at War'' (Victoria 1997). The book’s great contribution is that it has succeeded, where others have not, in bringing to public attention the largely unquestioning support of Japanese Buddhists for their nation’s militarism in the years following the Meiji Restoration in 1868 (when Japan opened its borders after nearly 250 years of feudal isolation) up until the end of WWII.{{sfn|Sato|Year unknown}}}}

Robert Aitken writes:
{{quote|All of us owe gratitude to Victoria, to James Heisig, and John Maraldo for their book, ''Rude Awakenings: Zen, the Kyoto School, and the Question of Nationalism'', and to the scholars who are publishing a series in ''Zen Quarterly'', the English language journal of the Soto Sect, disclosing the collusion of their sect in Japanese expansionism prior to and during World War II. These scholars help us as Western Zen students to make sense of the barest of hints of wartime involvement which we sensed previously, and to come to grips with the dark side of our heritage.&lt;ref group=web name=tricycle3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tricycle.com/feature/yasutani-roshi-hardest-koan?page=0,2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203233539/http://www.tricycle.com/feature/yasutani-roshi-hardest-koan?page=0,2|archivedate=February 3, 2012|publisher=[[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]]|date=Fall 1999|title=Yasutani Roshi: The Hardest Koan, Part 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ton Lathouwers, Chán-teacher in the Netherlands, in relation to ''Zen at War'' mentions [[Shin'ichi Hisamatsu|Hisamatsu's]] impossible question, "What will you do when you cannot do anything, when all your best intentions and great endeavour are invested to no avail whatsoever, when all you do is doomed to fail?",{{sfn|Tiltenberg|2002|p=9}} relating it to a statement by Takeo Sato:
{{quote|The question is not so much: What happened exactly and when. The deeper question – an even impossible question if you don't mind me adding already my personal urgency – is: How, in heaven's name, was this possible that human beings could lose to such a degree their true humanity, that they could lose themeselves?{{sfn|Tiltenberg|2002|p=9-10}}}}

==Apologies==
In response to ''Zen at war'' Ina Buitendijk started a campaign to receive apologies from leading parties within the Japanese Zen-schools:&lt;ref group=web name=Trouw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.wanadoo.nl/a.heer/Zen-at-war_Trouw.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604032214/http://home.wanadoo.nl/a.heer/Zen-at-war_Trouw.htm|title=Zenboeddhisme / Verlichte zenmeesters vallen van hun voetstuk|author=Elma Drayer|date=September 8, 2001|archivedate=June 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|On 8 January 2000 a letter arrived from a lady who lives in the Netherlands. It reported that her husband, from the age of six until he was nine, was confined in a concentration camp in the Dutch East Indies during World War II by the Japanese army [...] Not only he himself has suffered a great deal, the lady says, but also his distress has had, and still has, a great impact upon his family [...] The main reason the Dutch lady raised the question is that she had read Brian Victoria's book Zen at War and felt herself betrayed by the war-time words and deeds of the founder of the Sanbô Kyôdan [[Hakuun Yasutani|Yasutani Haku'un Roshi]], who repeatedly praised and promoted the war. Since she herself practices Zen contemplation under Father Johannes Kopp, a Zen teacher of the Sanbô Kyôdan,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Kopp has been ordained as a Zen-teacher by Yamada Koun:&lt;br&gt;
"Der Pallottinerpater Johannes Kopp S.A.C., geb. 1927, zum Priester geweiht 1963, gehört zur ersten Generation der christlichen Zen-Lehrer.&lt;br&gt;
1985 erlangte er durch Yamada Kôun Roshi in Kamakura, Japan, die Lehrbefähigung.&lt;br&gt;
2006 ernannte ihn Yamada Ryôun Roshi, der Nachfolger von Kôun Roshi, zum Associate Zen-Master des Sanbo-Kyodan von Kamakura."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://archive.is/20130212201954/http://zen-kontemplation.de/p_johannes_kopp_s_a_c/ Leben aus der Mitte. Zen - Kontemplation im Bistum Essen, ''p. Johannes Kopp S.A.C.'']&lt;/ref&gt; }} it had never occurred to her that the Zen masters, whom she deeply respected, would ever glorify the waging of war.{{sfn|Kubota Ji'un|2000}}}}

Her campaign resulted in responses from Kubota Ji'un, third abbot of the [[Sanbo Kyodan]],&lt;ref group=web name=apology /&gt; Hirata Seiko,{{sfn|Tiltenberg|2002|p=9-10}} and Hosokawa, abbot of [[Myoshin-ji]].&lt;ref group=web name=Trouw /&gt;

Kubota Ji'un writes:
{{quote|If Yasutani Roshi's words and deeds, now disclosed in the book, have deeply shocked anyone who practices in the Zen line of the Sanbô Kyôdan and, consequently, caused him or her to abhor or abandon the practice of Zen, it is a great pity indeed. For the offense caused by these errant words and actions of the past master, I, the present abbot of the Sanbô Kyôdan, cannot but express my heartfelt regret.&lt;ref group=web name=apology&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mkzc.org/apology.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704201754/http://www.mkzc.org/apology.html|title=Apology for What the Founder of the Sanbo-Kyodan, Haku'un Yasutani Roshi, Said and Did During World War II|archivedate=July 4, 2008|publisher=Maria Kannon Zen Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hirata Seiki writes:
{{quote|In the lineage of Rinzai Zen Buddhism, I am the Dharma-grandchild of Seki Seisatsu, a Zen master singled out for criticism by Brian Victoria. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere apologies for those words and those actions of Seisatsu that lent support to the Japanese militaries. Furthermore, I would like, on behalf of the entire [[Tenryuji]]-branch of Rinzai Zen Buddhism, to express my heart-felt remorse for the crimes committed by the Japanese military during the Pacific war and for the support given to the militarist regime by members of the Rinzai Zen-clergy.{{sfn|Tiltenberg|2002|p=12-13}}}}

==Criticism==
Brian Victoria has also been criticized.

Kemmyō Taira Sato states that Victoria's criticism of D. T. Suzuki is misplaced since he did not support Japanese militarism in his writings:
{{quote|In cases where Suzuki directly expresses his position on the contemporary political situation—whether in his articles, public talks, or letters to friends (in which he would have had no reason to misrepresent his views) – he is clear and explicit in his distrust of and opposition to State Shinto, rightwing thought, and the other forces that were pushing Japan toward militarism and war, even as he expressed interest in decidedly non-rightist ideologies like socialism.{{sfn|Sato|Year unknown|p=118}}}}

Victoria himself quotes critical remarks by Suzuki on the war and the support given to it by the Zen-institutions: "[T]hey diligently practiced the art of self-preservation through their narrow-minded focus on 'pacifying and preserving the state'."{{sfn|Victoria|2006|p=147}}

[[Muhō Noelke]] states that Victoria has mistranslated texts from [[Kōdō Sawaki]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to a friend about Zen practice, family life, Japanese Buddhism and the war about Zen at war|url=http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/200801.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207095039/http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/200801.shtml|archivedate=February 7, 2008|publisher=Antaiji: Temple of Peace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Aitken writes, "Unlike the other researchers, Victoria writes in a vacuum. He extracts the words and deeds of Japanese Buddhist leaders from their cultural and temporal context, and judges them from a present-day, progressive, Western point of view."&lt;ref group=web name=tricycle3 /&gt;

==Further studies==
The issues of Japanese nationalism, individualism, and the justification of social inequality have been taken up by other authors as well.

===Japanese nationalism===
In 1995 the [[Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture]] published ''Rude Awakenings. Zen, the Kyoto School, and the question of nationalism'',{{sfn|Heisig|1995}} which "examines the relationship between Japanese nationalism and intellectuals in the [[Kyoto School|Kyoto school]] and the world of Zen."{{sfn|Heisig|1995|p=vii}} It places the development of the Kyoto school, and its alleged support for the Japanese militarism, in the larger context of the Meiji-restoration.

Robert H. Sharf contributed to this volume,{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}} as a sequel to his ''The Zen of Japanese Nationalism'',{{sfn|Sharf|1993}} in which he extensively investigates the support of the Zen-institutions for the Imperial State, and the backgrounds of this support.

Nam-lin Hur has described the support of the [[Sōtō]] for the [[Korea under Japanese rule|occupation of Korea]] in the beginning of the 20th century.{{sfn|Hur|1999}}

===Individualism===
Peek argues that individualism, contrary to popular notions, is inherently supported by Buddhism. This inherent support made it possible to effect a transmission from authoritarian imperialism to democracy:
{{quote|[O]ne of the most significant and most overlooked explanations lies in the fact that the concepts of popular sovereignty and human rights have deep roots in Japanese culture. Specifically, it attempts to demonstrate that Buddhism, as one of the "Three Treasures" of Japanese culture, is inherently antithetical to the authoritarian socio-political structures that have periodically been imposed on the people of Japan.{{sfn|Peek|1992}}}}

===Social inequality===
The Soto-school has taken up the issue of social inequality.{{sfn|Yasuaki|Year unknown}}{{sfn|Bodiford|1996}} According to Bodiford, the Soto-school has insisted that "the types of social discrimination found in Sõtõ rituals and temple
practices" find their origin in "the medieval institutional regulations imposed by the Tokugawa regime, not in the religious attitudes, religious practices, or religious mission of Sõtõ Zen itself".{{sfn|Bodiford|1996|p=7}} The Soto-school has installed a Human Rights Division, to terminate the regulations which contribute to discriminatory practices.{{sfn|Bodiford|1996|p=1}}

===Enlightenment and authority===
''Zen at war'' has contributed to discussions on the meaning of "enlightenment", and the role of Zen-teachers in the emerging western Zen-Buddhism. Bodhin Kholhede, dharma heir of [[Philip Kapleau]], says:
{{quote|Now that we’ve had the book on Yasutani Roshi opened for us, we are presented with a new koan. Like so many koans, it is painfully baffling: How could an enlightened Zen master have spouted such hatred and prejudice? The nub of this koan, I would suggest, is the word enlightened. If we see enlightenment as an all-or-nothing place of arrival that confers a permanent saintliness on us, then we’ll remain stymied by this koan. But in fact there are myriad levels of enlightenment, and all evidence suggests that, short of full enlightenment (and perhaps even with it—who knows?), deeper defilements and habit tendencies remain rooted in the mind.&lt;ref group=web name=tricycle4&gt;[http://www.tricycle.com/feature/yasutani-roshi-hardest-koan?page=0,3 Tricycle, fall 1999, ''Yasutani Roshi: The Hardest Koan, Part 4'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Zeno Vendler''' (December 22, 1921 &amp;ndash; January 13, 2004) was an American [[Philosophy of language|philosopher of language]], and a founding member and former director of the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Calgary]].  His work on [[lexical aspect]],&lt;ref name="ll"/&gt; [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]],&lt;ref name="ll"/&gt; and [[nominalization]]&lt;ref name="calgary"/&gt; has been influential in the field of [[linguistics]].

==Life==
Vendler was born in [[Devecser]] and raised in [[Hungary]], where he learned to speak both [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name="ll"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://linguistlist.org/issues/15/15-286.html | work=[[LINGUIST List]] | date=24 January 2004 | accessdate=12 November 2008 | title=Obituary: Zeno Vendler | last=Fischer | first=Susan | last2=Kuroda | first2=S.-Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="senate"&gt;{{cite web | format=PDF | url=http://www-senate.ucsd.edu/assembly/memorial_resolutions/vendlerzeno.pdf | accessdate=12 November 2008 | title=In Memoriam: Zeno Vendler | date=24 February 2004 | last=Olafson | first=Frederick | last2=Stroll | first2=Avrum | publisher=[[University of California, San Diego]] Academic Senate}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied there until he began to train as a [[Jesuit]] priest in [[Maastricht]].&lt;ref name="calgary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.phil.ucalgary.ca/people/vendler.html | publisher=[[University of Calgary]] Department of Philosophy | title=Zeno Vendler, 1921-2004 | accessdate=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vendler later went to [[Harvard University]] to study [[philosophy]], and earned his doctorate in 1959 with a dissertation entitled "Facts and Laws." After holding several teaching positions at various American universities, he became a professor at the University of Calgary, where he was one of the founding members of the Department of Philosophy.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;  After leaving the University of Calgary in 1973, he taught at several other schools, including [[Rice University]]&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt; and the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref name="calgary"/&gt;

He was married twice&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;&amp;mdash;his first wife was poetry critic [[Helen Hennessy Vendler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-literary-criticism/vendler-helen | work=[http://www.enotes.com/ eNotes.com] | title=Vendler, Helen | accessdate=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;and had two sons.  Vendler died on 13 January 2004 at the age of 83 in [[Hetyefő]], ([[Veszprém County|Komitat Veszprém]]).&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;

==Influence==
Vendler's 1957 ''[[The Philosophical Review|Philosophical Review]]'' article "Verbs and times"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2182371 | title=Verbs and times | jstor=2182371 | journal=[[The Philosophical Review]] | year=1957 | last=Vendler | volume=66 | first=Zeno | issue=2| pages=143–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; first introduced a four-way distinction between verbs based on their [[Aspect (linguistics)|aspectual]] features,&lt;ref name="lin"&gt;{{cite web | last=Lin | first=Jimmy | url=http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/publications/Lin_PhD_thesis_2004.pdf | page=19 | title=Event Structure and the Encoding of Arguments: The Syntax of the Mandarin and English Verb Phrase | year=2004 | accessdate=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a distinction which has had a major influence on theories of [[lexical aspect]] or ''aktionsart''.

Under Vendler's model, events may be classified into one of four aspectual classes:
*''states'', which are static and do not have an endpoint ("know," "love");
*''activities'', which are dynamic and do not have an endpoint ("run," "drive");
*''accomplishments'', which have an endpoint and are incremental or gradual ("paint a picture," "build a house"); and
*''achievements'', which have an endpoint and occur instantaneously ("recognize," "notice").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Lin | first=Jimmy | url=http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/publications/Lin_PhD_thesis_2004.pdf | page=19 | title=Event Structure and the Encoding of Arguments: The Syntax of the Mandarin and English Verb Phrase | year=2004 | accessdate=12 November 2008}} Examples from {{cite book | last=Dowty | first=David | year=1979 | authorlink=David Dowty | title=Word Meaning and the Montague Grammar | location=[[Dordrecht]] | publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company | page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vendler also popularized the use of the [[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive aspect]] as a diagnostic for distinguishing between these lexical classes;&lt;ref name="gabriele"/&gt; for example, activities and accomplishments are able to appear in the progressive (''He is running'', ''He is painting a picture''), whereas states and achievements are not (*''He is knowing French'', *''He is recognizing his friend'').&lt;ref name="gabriele"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gabriele | first=Alison | title=Transfer and Transition in the L2 Acquisition of Aspect | year=2008 | journal=Studies in Second Language Acquisition| pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vendler's categories are still widely used in current research in areas such as [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[second language acquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the following articles:
*{{Cite book | year=1984 | last=Tai | first=James H.-Y. | contribution=Verbs and times in Chinese: Vendler's four categories | title=Papers from the parasession on lexical semantics | editor-last=Testen | editor-first=David | editor2-last=Mishra | editor2-first=Veena | editor3-last=Drogo | editor3-first=Joseph | place=[[Chicago]] | publisher=Chicago Linguistic Society}}

*Ritter, Elizabeth, and Sara Thomas Rosen (2008). "Animacy in Blackfoot: Implications for Event Structure and Clause Structure."
*and {{cite journal | last=Gabriele | first=Alison | title=Transfer and Transition in the L2 Acquisition of Aspect | year=2008 | journal=Studies in Second Language Acquisition}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Linguist [[S.-Y. Kuroda]] has said that Vendler's terms ''achievement'' and ''accomplishment'' "have since become basic technical vocabulary in modern linguistics,"&lt;ref name="ll"/&gt; and have been used to develop numerous theories and allow for "sophisticated and highly technical" research in a variety of areas.&lt;ref name="ll"/&gt;

Vendler's 1967 book ''Linguistics in Philosophy'', a collection of some of his earlier articles, had a large influence on the field of [[Ordinary language philosophy|linguistic philosophy]],&lt;ref name="calgary"/&gt; which attempts to use the study of language and linguistic structures to inform philosophical theory.  The book has been described as an attempt to "reconcile the empirical basis of linguistic science with the a priori nature of philosophical reasoning."&lt;ref name="calgary"/&gt;  His 1972 ''Res Cogitans'' also dealt with the relationship between language and philosophy.&lt;ref name="calgary"/&gt;

Overall, Vendler published over 30 widely cited journal articles and four monographs.&lt;ref name="calgary"/&gt;
