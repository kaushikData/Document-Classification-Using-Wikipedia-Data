'''''A Little Chaos''''' is a 2014 British [[Costume drama|period drama]] film directed by [[Alan Rickman]]. The story was conceived by Allison Deegan and she co-wrote the screenplay along with Rickman and [[Jeremy Brock]]. The film stars [[Kate Winslet]], [[Matthias Schoenaerts]], Alan Rickman, [[Stanley Tucci]], [[Helen McCrory]], [[Steven Waddington]], [[Jennifer Ehle]] and [[Rupert Penry-Jones]]. The film was financed by the [[Lionsgate UK]] and produced by [[BBC Films]]. It was the second film directed by Rickman, after his 1997 directorial debut ''[[The Winter Guest]]''. It was the second collaboration of Rickman and Winslet after their 1995 film ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]''. Production took place in London in mid 2013. The film had its world premiere at the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival]] as the closing night film on 13 September 2014.

==Plot==
[[King Louis XIV of France]] assigns the design and construction of the [[Gardens of Versailles]] to [[André Le Nôtre]]. Le Nôtre interviews several other gardeners who submitted designs for the project, including one woman who works alone, Sabine de Barra. He sees her move a potted plant in his garden prior to her interview, and questions her deference to order in design. Sabine affirms her respect for his work and suggests that she would like to create something uniquely French rather than follow classical and renaissance styles. He shows her the door in record time, and she leaves disheartened.

[[File:BosquetRocailles02.jpg|thumb|350px|''Bosquet de la Salle-de-Bal'' at [[Gardens of Versailles]], laid out by [[André Le Nôtre]] between 1680 and 1683.]]
On the night after her interview, André surprises Sabine at her home and tasks her with responsibility for an outdoor ballroom surrounded by a fountain and landscaping. André's plans had called for a constant supply of water from a great distance at great expense. Sabine devises another engineering solution based on a reservoir from which water can be continuously recycled through the fountains she has designed. She makes little progress at first, with workmen recommended by one of the men rejected by  André, until another competitor, Thierry Duras, intervenes and offers the use of his crew.

As a beautiful commoner Sabine stands out at court, attracting attention, and is befriended by the King's brother Duc [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d'Orleans]] and his wife [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine]]. At times, Sabine appears haunted by brief glimpses of a young girl or a girl's voice she hears calling. She is attracted to André but does not act on her feelings, while André quietly endures the infidelities of his wife Françoise, who insists that her husband's success is founded on her influence at court. When Françoise warns him against an affair with Sabine, he quotes her own speech declaring their right to seek comfort elsewhere, and becomes resolute in his intention to pursue a relationship with Sabine.

[[Maria Theresa of Spain|Queen Maria Theresa]] dies suddenly. André informs his wife, who is shaken at the prospect that this will lessen her influence at court. The king is shocked at the loss of his wife and takes refuge in his gardener's work area, amongst the pear trees. Sabine finds the king there as she delivers perennials for a trade, first mistaking him for the gardener. After she recognizes him she agrees to continue their conversation as equals. She finds great favour in the king's eyes, and he invites her to travel with him and his court to his palace and gardens at [[Fontainebleau]].

Sabine is visited by Françoise, who tells her that André's passionate intentions are only a whim and will prove short-lived. After they both leave, Françoise's lover opens the sluice gates from the reservoir and floods the work site, destroying much of the earthworks. Sabine nearly drowns trying to close the gate, and André saves her.  The next morning, Sabine works vigorously to mend some of the damage done by the storm.  That same day, Louis XIV visits Sabine's work site and assesses the project skeptically but allows it to proceed. 

Afterwards, André finds a glove at the worksite that belongs to his wife Françoise. He realizes she is behind the sabotage of the project; returns the glove and ends their relationship.

Sabine goes to court again, where [[Antoine Nompar de Caumont|Duc de Lauzun]] introduces her to the king's mistress, the [[Marquise de Montespan]], who in turn introduces her to the women of the court. At first they tease her, but when they learn she is widowed and lost her 6-year-old daughter, they reveal their own losses and welcome her into their circle, where they often discuss topics the king forbids at court, including the deaths of their children. The Marquise formally presents Sabine to the King when he arrives, and Sabine offers him a four-seasons rose. They converse about the nature of the rose and its life cycle, beauty, hardships and death, and the gardener's responsibilities. It is Sabine's veiled defense of the aging Madame de Montespan, who has begun to lose the king's favor.

André waits for Sabine outside her room that night, and they finally make love. In the morning, André finds himself alone in bed. Sabine is upstairs, lost in the memory of the day her daughter and husband died. He is taking their daughter with him on a business trip.  Before leaving, he admits to Sabine that he has a mistress. Soon after, he grabs their daughter and gets into the carriage. As they are leaving Sabine sees that the carriage has a faulty wheel and learns that her husband is taking their daughter to his mistress's home, causing her to race after them; when she stops in front of the carriage it topples off the road and down a hill, killing both father and daughter. André finds Sabine in the grip of this memory and convinces her to stop blaming herself for their deaths.

When Sabine's project is complete, the king and his court arrive for its inauguration. To the music of a hidden orchestra, everyone begins dancing as the fountains send water coursing down the tiers around the ballroom floor. Sabine and André leave the others dancing and walk into the garden together.

==Production==
The story was conceived by Allison Deegan, who co-wrote the screenplay along with Rickman and [[Jeremy Brock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/alan-rickmans-a-little-chaos-sells-to-focus-features-1201316333/|title=Alan Rickman's 'A Little Chaos' Sells to Focus Features|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was financed by the [[Lionsgate UK]] and produced by [[BBC Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lionsgate U.K. to Finance Alan Rickman's 'A Little Chaos,' Starring Kate Winslet| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lionsgate-uk-finance-alan-rickmans-426499|accessdate=12 May 2013| newspaper=Hollywood Reporter| date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production began in March 2013. Producer [[Zygi Kamasa]] of Lionsgate said that "we are delighted to be working with the best of British actors and directors like Kate Winslet and Alan Rickman as we move forward in doubling our investment in British films in 2014."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kate Winslet joins A Little Chaos|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/entertainment/09-Mar-2013/kate-winslet-joins-a-little-chaos|accessdate=19 May 2013| work=The Nation (Pakistan)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickman said: "The film is not just frills at the wrists and collars. It's about people getting their hands dirty and building something in order to entertain the other world they serve. It's about how one world maintains the other, often at the cost of women."&lt;ref name="Screen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.screendaily.com/features/interviews/alan-rickman-a-little-chaos/5076841.article |title=Alan Rickman, A Little Chaos |accessdate=9 September 2014 |work=Screen Daily | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140909190411/http://www.screendaily.com/features/interviews/alan-rickman-a-little-chaos/5076841.article| archivedate=9 September 2014| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
[[File:Blenheim Palace 5 (5598661762).jpg|thumb|upright|200px|right|Landscape scenes were shot at [[Blenheim Palace]].]]
On 17 January 2013, it was announced that Kate Winslet and Matthias Schoenaerts had been cast as the leads in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Kate Winslet &amp; Matthias Schoenaerts To Star In Alan Rickman Directed Period Drama 'A Little Chaos'|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/kate-winslet-matthias-schoenaerts-to-star-in-alan-rickman-directed-period-drama-a-little-chaos-20130117|date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickman had Winslet in mind for the lead role of Sabine de Barra and continued with her when two weeks into shooting, Winslet announced that she was pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Man who would be King|url=http://www.camerimage.pl/en/The-Man-Who-Would-Be-King.html|date=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to directing, Rickman took the role of [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]. He explained that "the only way I could do it was because in a way, he's like a director, Louis, so you kind of keep the same expression on your face. As a director, you see everything somehow. It's like a huge all-encompassing eye that sees everything, and it's able to cherry pick; "Move that," "Don't do that," "Do it this way," "Change this colour". And I don't know where that comes from, but it does, once you're given the job, and I have a feeling Louis probably would've been a great film director".&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite news| title=Watch Kate Winslet meet the king in Alan Rickman's 'A Little Chaos'|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/09/09/kate-winslet-alan-rickman-little-chaos-toronto/ |accessdate=10 September 2014|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly |date=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Despite being set in [[France]], complete filming took place in England.&lt;ref name="PN" /&gt; [[Principal photography]] commenced on 27 March 2013 and continued over eight weeks in [[Black Park]], [[Cliveden|Cliveden House]], [[Pinewood Studios]], [[Blenheim Palace]], [[Waddesdon Manor]], [[Hampton Court Palace]], [[Ham House]], [[Ashridge]] and [[Chenies Manor House|Chenies Manor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kate Winslet gets into costume for A Little Chaos as she stars in yet another period drama|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2314052/Kate-Winslet-gets-costume-stars-period-drama-A-Little-Chaos.html |accessdate=12 May 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Palace closed for filming of Kate Winslet's new movie|url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/yourtown/witney/10393462.Palace_closed_for_filming_of_Kate_Winslet_s_new_movie/|accessdate=2 May 2013|newspaper=Oxford Mail |date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Little Chaos |url=http://buntyme.wordpress.com/2013/05/21/a-little-chaos/|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PN"&gt;{{cite news|title=About the Production |url=http://www.nationalgardeningweek.org.uk/A-little-chaos/behind-the-scenes.aspx|date=11 March 2015| work=National Gardening Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming ended on 8 June 2013 in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British Films Directory|url=http://film.britishcouncil.org/british-films-directory/in-production|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rickman, filming "wasn't easy, though; throwing Kate into freezing water at 1am, the carriage crash, scenes with 80 extras, tight schedules in venues like Blenheim Palace. It's a constant tap dance between control and freedom and of course the budget guides everything."&lt;ref name="Screen" /&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
[[File:Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman 2014 TIFF.png|thumb|upright|250px|right|Winslet and Rickman at the screening of the film at the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival]].]]
The film generated mixed reviews from critics, with the performances from the cast being highly praised. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a 40% rating based on reviews from 75 critics, with an average score of 5.3/10. The site's consensus states that "Stylish and well-acted without ever living up to its dramatic potential, A Little Chaos is shouldered by the impressive efforts of a talented cast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Little Chaos (2014)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_little_chaos/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film holds an average score of 51, based on 15 reviews, which indicates "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-little-chaos |title=A Little Chaos |website=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine Shoard of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film three out of five stars and wrote that "Winslet manages emotional honesty within anachronistic confines, and Schoenaerts escapes with dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Little Chaos review – Louis XIV gardening romp borders on ridiculous|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/10/a-little-chaos-alan-rickman-kate-winslet-louis-xiv-film|accessdate =10 September 2014 | work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Adams in his review for ''[[Screen International]]'' said, "the film is a gracefully made delight, replete with lush costumes, fruity performances, love amongst the flowerbeds and even a little mild peril. Yes it lacks real dramatic edge and may be seen as a typical British period costume film, but it is also a classily made pleasure that will delight its target audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Little Chaos review|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/a-little-chaos/5077408.article |accessdate =10 September 2014 |work=Screen Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' felt that "This decently acted film is agreeable entertainment, even if it works better on a scene by scene basis than in terms of overall flow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='A Little Chaos': Toronto Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/a-little-chaos-toronto-review-732108|accessdate =11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tim Robey in The Telegraph said in his review: "If you see only one film about 17th-century French landscape gardening this year, it probably ought to be ''A Little Chaos'', a heaving bouquet of a picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Robey |first1=Tim |title=The Telegraph Review of A Little Chaos|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/11086772/A-Little-Chaos-review-Winslet-is-charming.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, David Sexton of the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying that "Kate Winslet charms as a gardener at the Court of Louis XIV, but it's not enough to keep this inauthentic piece from wilting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Toronto Film Festival: A Little Chaos - film review|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/film/toronto-film-festival-a-little-chaos--film-review-9723241.html|accessdate =10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also criticized the film, writing that ''A Little Chaos'' is "all too tidy as it imposes a predictable, pat modern sensibility on a most unconvincing depiction of late 17th-century French aristocratic life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Toronto Film Review: 'A Little Chaos' |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/toronto-film-review-alan-rickmans-a-little-chaos-1201303181/|accessdate =14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaleem Aftab of ''[[The Independent]]'' gave the film two out of five stars, noting that while the performances were exceptional, but the talents of the players were wasted. He wrote that "it all starts off so promisingly" and praised the [[cinematography|camera work]] and language, but found it quickly fails as "a melancholic look at grief" where "at least four different genres [clash] against each other, occasionally in the same scene" and "the romance seems to take place off-screen." She concluded: "There was a 17 year gap between Rickman's first and second film and on this evidence it's easy to see why. While he can get performances out of the actors, he lacks command of pacing and plot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/a-little-chaos-review-alan-rickman-lacks-pacing-and-plot-in-return-to-directors-chair-9726762.html |title=A Little Chaos, review: Alan Rickman lacks pacing and plot in return to director's chair | work= [[The Independent]] | date= 15 September 2014 | accessdate= 17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accuracy==
Some of the film's characters are fictional, including [[Kate Winslet]]'s Sabine de Barra. The film is set in 1682, but [[André Le Nôtre]], began work at Versailles in 1661. Le Nôtre was nearly 70 in 1682, twice the age he appears to be as portrayed by Schoenaerts in the film.&lt;ref name=accuracy&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2015/apr/23/reel-history-a-little-chaos-alan-rickman-kate-winslet-palace-of-versailles | title=A Little Chaos: leads historical accuracy down the garden path | work= [[The Guardian]] | date= 23 September 2015 | accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A garden much like that in the film exists at Versailles, the ''Salle de Bal'' or ''Bosquet de la Salle-de-Bal''.&lt;ref name=accuracy/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8949">'''Al-Shanfarā ''' was a semi-legendary pre-Islamic poet, putatively associated with [[Ṭāif]] and dying around the mid-sixth century CE, and the supposed author of the celebrated poem ''[[Lāmiyyāt ‘al-Arab]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Fuat Sezgin, ''Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums: Bd. 2, Poesie Bis ca. 430 H.'' (Leiden: Brill 1975), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoys a status as a figure of an archetypal outlaw antihero, critiquing the hypocrisies of his society from his position as an outsider.

==Life==

What is known about al-Shanfarā is inferred from the poems which he is believed with confidence to have composed. He seems fairly certainly to have belonged to the [[Yemen]]ite [[al-Azd]] tribe, probably specifically to the [[Al-Khazraj]] clan.&lt;ref&gt;Wisam Mansour, 'Al-Shanfara's ''Lamiyyatu’l Arab'' and the Horrors of Desert Travelling', ''Ankara Üniversitesi Dil ve Tarih-Coğrafya Fakültesi Dergisi'', 45.2 (2005), 45-57 (p. 46 n. 1), http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/26/1007/12214.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Shanfarā attracted a number of pseudo-historical ''akhbār'' (reports) in texts like the ''[[Kitāb al-aghānī]]'' by [[Abū al-Faraj]], [[al-Anbārī|al-Anbārī's]] commentary on the ''[[Mufaddaaliyyat|Mufaḍḍaliyāt]]'', mostly focusing on explaining how he came to be exiled from his tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych, 'Archetype and Attribution in Early Arabic Poetry: Al-Shanfarā and the Lāmiyyat al-‘Arab', ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', 18 (1986), 361-90 (pp. 367-71), https://www.jstor.org/stable/163382. Fuat Sezgin, ''Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums: Bd. 2, Poesie Bis ca. 430 H.'' (Leiden: Brill 1975), pp. 133-37.&lt;/ref&gt; He and his companion [[Ta’bbaṭa-Sharran]] were thought to be among the few people of pre-Islamic Arabia who could run down an antelope.&lt;ref&gt;''Classical Arabic Poetry: 162 Poems from Imrulkais to Ma‘rri'', trans. by Charles Greville Tuetey (London: KPI, 1985), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==

Al-Shanfarā is named as the author of a scattering of individual verses as well as a long passage known as ''The Ta’iyya of al-Shanfarā'' preserved in the seminal collection of pre-Islamic verse, the ''[[Mufaddaaliyyat|Mufaḍḍaliyāt]]''. His works are discussed in at least twenty medieval and early medieval scholarly commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;Listed in Fuat Sezgin, ''Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums: Bd. 2, Poesie Bis ca. 430 H.'' (Leiden: Brill 1975), pp. 135-37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Shanfarā is most famous for, supposedly, composing the ''[[Lāmiyyāt ‘al-Arab]]''. Although its attribution has been disputed ever since medieval times,&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych, 'Archetype and Attribution in Early Arabic Poetry: Al-Shanfarā and the Lāmiyyat al-‘Arab', ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', 18 (1986), 361-90, https://www.jstor.org/stable/163382.&lt;/ref&gt; the memorable first-person figure of the misanthropic brigand celebrating his position on the edge of society that the poem draws has strongly influenced views of al-Shanfarā.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Wisam Mansour, 'Al-Shanfara's ''Lamiyyatu’l Arab'' and the Horrors of Desert Travelling', ''Ankara Üniversitesi Dil ve Tarih-Coğrafya Fakültesi Dergisi'', 45.2 (2005), 45-57 (p. 46 n. 2), http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/26/1007/12214.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; We can if nothing else say that if the ''Lāmiyyāt'' is a later composition, it positions al-Shanfarā as the archetypal outlaw of a pre-Islamic heroic age, viewed nostalgically from a later era.

Of works considered likely actually to have been by Al-Shanfarā, ''The Ta’iyya of al-Shanfarā'' (''Mufaḍḍaliyya'' no. 20) is the most renowned. As translated by Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych, it runs as follows.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych, 'Archetype and Attribution in Early Arabic Poetry: Al-Shanfarā and the Lāmiyyat al-‘Arab', ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', 18 (1986), 361-90 (pp. 371-73, https://www.jstor.org/stable/163382.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
: 1. Alas, Umm ‘Amr gathered her resolve and departed;
: she bade no farewell to her neighbors
: when she turned and went away.
: 2. Umm ‘Amr left before us, without warning
: and cast over us the shadows of her camels' necks.
: 3. By my two eyes, she went forth at evening,
: then nighttime and morning;
: then she finished her affairs, and departed and went away.
: 4. How my heart aches for Umayma! After my desire--
: May God grant her a life of ease--she went away.
: 5. Oh neighboress! you are not one to arouse blame
: when she is mentioned, nor one to elicit hatred.
: 6. She stirred my delight, never lowering her veil
: when she walked forth, not glancing left or right.
: 7. At night, after a short sleep, she takes to the neighborwomen
: milk drawn at evening, when gifts are scarce.
: 8. She alights in her dwelling, a place secured from blame,
: when in other dwellings blame alights.
: 9. Modest, as though she had lost something on the ground
: and was intent on finding it; if she speaks to you, she is curt.
: 10. Umayma's mate is not disgraced by her repute;
: when women are mentioned, she is chaste, of high esteem.
: 11. When, in the evening, he goes out, he returns to his eye's delight,
: as a happy man returns, not asking where she's been.
: 12. She was delicate and dignified, full-statured, in full bloom;
: If beauty could change people into jinn, a jinni she would be.
: 13. We spent the night together as if the tent above us were ringed
: in basil, wind-wafted, in the evening, dew-moistened,
: 14. Basil from the lowland of Ḥalya, abloom and redolent;
: from a region untouched by drought.
: 15. Many a fighting band, their bows red from wear, did I call forth;
: he who raids returns at times with plunder, at times without.
: 16. We went out of the river-bed [that lies] between Mish‘al and al-Jabā,
: how far off I led my flock!
: 17. I trek on and on over the earth that will never harm me
: to strike a foe or meet up with my doom.
: 18. I trek on, despite the raid's fatigue and distance;
: each morning and evening bringing me ever closer.
: 19. A mother of many children I have seen feeding them;
: when she feeds them she is niggardly and gives little.
: 20. She fears we will be destitute if she is generous,
: as hungry as we are-how she runs her family!
: 21. It is not that she is stingy with what is in her provision bag,
: but it is because she fears hunger [for us] that she holds back.
: 22. A companion of ''ṣa‘alik'', there is no veil before her;
: she is not hoped for at home till her night-raid is complete.
: 23. A quiver she has of thirty broad-tipped arrows;
: when she spies from afar the first of the foe,
: with excitement she quivers.
: 24. She rushes upon the battle-ready foe, baring her leg to the knee;
: she roves like the he-ass before his herd, circling his she-asses.
: 25. When they panic she lets fly a white cutting [sword];
: she shoots her store of arrows, then draws her blade.
: 26. A keen blade, salt-colored, of unsullied steel,
: cutting, like the ripples of the oft-described pond.
: 27. You see [the swords] swinging to and fro like the tails of
: calves returning from water;
: they have drunk a first draught of blood, and then a second.
: 28. We slew a pilgrim for a pilgrim slain, one leading a beast to
: sacrifice for one with matted hair;
: at Minā where the stones are thrown, in the midst of chanting pilgrims.
: 29. We repaid the Salāmān ibn Mufrij what we owed them;
: for the crimes their hands had committed and their past sins.
: 30. A tribe was congratulated for me, but I brought them no benefit;
: and I became part of a tribe that was not my stock.
: 31. We quenched by [slaying] ‘Abd Allāh part of our burning thirst
: and by [slaying] ‘Awf before the battle-ground when the battle-cry went up.
: 32. When my death comes, I shall not mind;
: my mother's sisters will not weep for me, nor my paternal aunt.
: 33. For had I never stirred from sitting home amid my kin,
: yet death would have come to me between the two tent-poles.
: 34. Let no friend come to tend me; if illness ails me,
: my cure will be to race up Dhū al-Burayqayn's peak.
: 35. I am sweet if my sweetness is desired,
: and bitter when the soul of an inconstant comrade thinks me bitter.
: 36. Disdainful of what I disdain,
: quick to respond to every soul that is inclined to make me happy.

'''''Allegory of Virtue and Vice''''' or '''''The Choice Between Virtue and Vice''''' or '''''The Choice of Hercules''''' is a painting by [[Paolo Veronese]], created circa 1565 in [[Venice]], [[Italy]] and now located in the [[Frick Collection]]. It is a large-scale allegorical painting depicting [[Hercules]]' struggle between virtue and vice, personified here by the figures of the two women physically pulling him in different directions. 

==Subject==
In the painting, [[Virtue]] appears to be winning the struggle over [[Hercules]], but [[Vice]] has torn Hercules' stocking and still reaches out her hand toward him. Concealed behind her skirt is a dagger and a statue of a [[sphinx]]. On the stonework above the scene, an inscription reads "[HO]NOR ET VIRTUS/[P]OST MORTE FLORET (Honor and Virtue Flourish after Death)."&lt;ref&gt;http://collections.frick.org/view/objects/asitem/items$0040:276&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[allegory]], the job of this painting is to convey a moral message, that of the superiority of virtue over vice. 

The genre of allegory contrasts with Veronese's well-known tableaus of historical and biblical scenes, such as the [[Marriage at Cana]] as well as with the less formal works of other [[Renaissance]] Venetian painters like [[Giorgione]] or [[Titian]]. This work, along with "Wisdom and Strength," also in the [[Frick Collection]], is believed to be Veronese's first in this style. These two works are also thought by scholars to be his first to cross the Alps.&lt;ref&gt;http://frick-venetianrepublic.tumblr.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
''The Choice Between Virtue and Vice'' and ''[[Allegory of Wisdom and Strength|Wisdom and Strength]]'' have traveled together since their creation, through many prestigious owners and collections. Because of this, many scholars assumed that Veronese painted them as a pair. In 1970, Edgar Munhall was the first scholar to suggest that they were simply made at the same time, not as pendants.&lt;ref&gt;Mundhall, Edgar, "Masterpieces of the Frick Collection", 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Work undertaken by scholars at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in the 2000s confirmed that the two were made individually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Mahon, Centeno, Wypyski, Salomon, and Bayer |chapter=Technical Study of Three Allegorical Paintings by Paolo Veronese: The Choice between Virtue and Vice, Wisdom and Strength, and Mars and Venus United by Love |pages=83–108 |title=Metropolitan Museum Studies in Art, Science, and Technology, Vol. 1 |date=2010 |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |isbn=9781588393654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its creation in Venice, this painting traveled through the hands of [[Emperor Rudolph II]] of the Holy Roman Empire, [[Queen Christina of Sweden]], the Odesalchi family, the famous collection of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orleans]], and then through the hands of various Englishmen and art dealers before arriving at its current home in the Frick Collection.&lt;ref&gt;http://frick-venetianrepublic.tumblr.com/post/147055675292/follow-the-remarkable-provenance-of-paolo&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Baku'''|獏{{lang|en| or }}貘}} are Japanese supernatural beings that devour dreams and nightmares. According to legend, they were created by the spare pieces that were left over when the gods finished creating all other animals. They have a long history in Japanese folklore and art, and more recently have appeared in Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]].

The Japanese term ''baku'' has two current meanings, referring to both the traditional dream-devouring creature and to the [[Malayan tapir]].&lt;ref name="nakagawa"&gt;Nakagawa Masako 1999 "Sankai ibutsu: An early seventeenth-century Japanese illustrated manuscript". ''Sino-Japanese Studies'', 11:24-38. Pages 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, there have been changes in how the baku is depicted.

==History and description==
The traditional Japanese nightmare-devouring baku originates in [[Chinese folklore]] about the ''[[Mo (Chinese zoology)|mo]]'' 貘 and was familiar in Japan as early as the [[Muromachi period]] (14th-15th century).&lt;ref&gt;Hori Tadao 2005 "Cultural note on dreaming and dream study in the future: Release from nightmare and development of dream control technique," ''Sleep and Biological Rhythms'' 3 (2), 49–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Hori Tadao has described the dream-eating abilities attributed to the traditional baku and relates them to other preventatives against nightmare such as [[amulet]]s. [[Kaii-Yōkai Denshō Database]], citing a 1957 paper, and Mizuki also describe the dream-devouring capacities of the traditional baku.&lt;ref&gt;Mizuki, Shigeru 2004 ''Mujara 5: Tōhoku, Kyūshū-hen'' (in Japanese). Japan: Soft Garage. page 137. {{ISBN|4-86133-027-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early 17th-century Japanese manuscript, the ''Sankai Ibutsu'' ({{nihongo2|山海異物}}), describes the baku as a shy, Chinese mythical [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]] with an [[elephant]]’s trunk, [[rhinoceros]]' eyes, an [[ox]]'s tail, and a [[tiger]]'s paws, which protected against pestilence and evil, although eating nightmares was not included among its abilities.&lt;ref name="nakagawa"/&gt; However, in a 1791 Japanese wood-block illustration, a specifically dream-destroying baku is depicted with an elephant’s head, tusks, and trunk, with horns and tiger’s claws.&lt;ref&gt;Kern, Adam L. 2007 ''Manga from the Floating World: Comicbook culture and the kibyoshi of Edo Japan''. Cambridge: Harvard University Asian Center. Page 236, figure 4.26.&lt;/ref&gt; The elephant’s head, trunk, and tusks are characteristic of baku portrayed in classical era (pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]]) Japanese wood-block prints (see illustration) and in shrine, temple, and [[netsuke]] carvings.&lt;ref&gt;{{nihongo2|[http://www.sirasaki.co.jp/baku/baku.html 夢貘まくら]}}. (Accessed September 5, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Smart, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fv20070216a1.html Delivering men from evil]", ''Japan Times,'' February 16, 2007. (Accessed September 8, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/shrine-guide-2.shtml. (Accessed September 8, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://collectionsonline.lacma.org/mwebcgi/mweb.exe?request=image;hex=M91_250_104.jpg (Accessed October 12, 2010.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the [[Meiji period]], [[Lafcadio Hearn]] (1902) described a baku with very similar attributes that was also able to devour nightmares.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, Lafcadio 1902 Kottō: ''Being Japanese Curios, with Sundry Cobwebs''. Macmillan. Pages 245-248. {{ISBN|4-86133-027-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Legend has it, that a person who wakes up from a bad dream can call out to baku. A child having a nightmare in Japan will wake up and repeat three times, "Baku-san, come eat my dream." Legends say that the baku will come into the child's room and devour the bad dream, allowing the child to go back to sleep peacefully. However, calling to the baku must be done sparingly, because if he remains hungry after eating one's nightmare, he may also devour their hopes and desires as well, leaving them to live an empty life. The baku can also be summoned for protection from bad dreams prior to falling asleep at night. In the 1910s, it was common for Japanese children to keep a baku talisman at their bedside.&lt;ref&gt;M.Reese:"The Asian traditions and myths".pg.60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hadland Davis F., "Myths and Legends of Japan" (London: [[G. G. Harrap]], 1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Black Museum'''" is the sixth and final episode of the fourth series of anthology series ''[[Black Mirror]]''. It was written by [[Charlie Brooker]], with one part adapted from [[Penn Jillette]]'s short story "The Pain Addict", and directed by [[Colm McCarthy (director)|Colm McCarthy]]. The episode first premiered on [[Netflix]], along with the rest of series four, on 29 December 2017.

The episode is presented as a series of three stories told by Rolo Haynes ([[Douglas Hodge]]), proprietor of the remote "Black Museum" to his solitary visitor Nish ([[Letitia Wright]]), all involving various exhibits related to cutting edge technological connections and transfers with the human brain that Rolo had developed in his scientific career.

==Plot==
Whilst waiting for her car to charge in a remote charging station, Nish ([[Letitia Wright]]) comes across the neighbouring Black Museum, which houses "authentic criminological arte&lt;!-- British English --&gt;facts". She meets the proprietor, Rolo Haynes ([[Douglas Hodge]]), and explains she is out this way as her father lives nearby and her mother suggested she stop by to surprise him. Haynes offers to give her a tour, in which he recounts the stories of the arte&lt;!-- British English --&gt;facts he has collected, shown in flashback during the episode.

In his past, Haynes was a neurological research recruiter and persuaded Dr. Peter Dawson ([[Daniel Lapaine]]) to get an experimental neurological implant that would allow him to feel the physical sensations of others. Dawson used this to feel the pain of his patients, which allowed him to become an expert at diagnosing and treating them. Meanwhile, Dawson also used the interface to enhance sex with his girlfriend. A senator who had been poisoned was brought into the hospital one night and as he died, Dawson remained connected to him, experiencing his death via the implant. After passing out, Dawson awoke with the side effect that he now experienced pain as pleasure. He begins to use his patients' suffering for personal sexual arousal. He was removed from the hospital and, addicted to pain, began mutilating himself. Realising that he could not inflict fear (and thus, further pleasure) on himself, Dawson tasered, tortured, and killed a homeless man with a drill. He was arrested, but fell into a coma.

In the present, Nish offers Haynes water since the museum's [[air conditioning]] is broken and they are both sweating profusely, and Haynes tells another story about a plush toy monkey. Haynes convinced a man named Jack ([[Aldis Hodge]]) to transfer the consciousness of his comatose wife Carrie ([[Alexandra Roach]]) into his own brain. Carrie initially enjoyed sharing the sensations that Jack felt in the real world, particularly hugs with their toddler son Parker. However, shared consciousness began to take a toll on the couple, as Jack lacked privacy and Carrie had no [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] in the real world. Haynes allowed Jack to put Carrie on "pause", infuriating her whenever he allowed her consciousness again. Jack met Emily (Yasha Jackson), and the two began dating, to Carrie's impotent fury. Emily pressured Jack to have Haynes transfer the consciousness of Carrie into a stuffed monkey, which was then given to Parker. The toy could only speak two phrases, "Monkey loves you" and "Monkey needs a hug". Carrie was furious, but Emily threatened her with deletion if she did not behave. Eventually, Parker grew tired of the toy and abandoned it, with Carrie trapped inside. In the present, Haynes tells Nish that the transfer of Carrie into the stuffed monkey was declared illegal and led to his firing. Haynes then reveals that Carrie is still inside the stuffed monkey in the exhibit, since it is also illegal to delete her.

Haynes and Nish move on to the main attraction of the museum: a dismal hologram projection of Clayton Leigh ([[Babs Olusanmokun]]), a convicted murderer, the details of whose crime were briefly shown in the previous segments on TVs. While Leigh was on death row, Haynes coaxed him to sign over the rights to his post-death consciousness in exchange for money to help support his family, despite the objections of his wife, who feared for his safety. After his execution, Clayton found himself reborn as a hologram inside Haynes' museum. Haynes set Leigh up in an execution display, in which visitors could pull a lever to make Clayton experience the agony of the electric chair and feel like they were electrocuting him all over again. They could then leave with a key chain souvenir containing a preserved, and fully independent, copy of Clayton eternally in agony. Each electrocution is set to last 10 seconds, as 15 seconds or more would disrupt the hologram and erase it.

In the present, Haynes begins to [[asphyxiate]]. Nish reveals herself to be Clayton's daughter: she sabotaged the museum's AC so that Haynes would become thirsty and accept her poisoned water. She asserts that her father was actually innocent, but the state never overturned the conviction. Protesters argued against the torments Haynes was subjecting Leigh's hologram to, which hurt the popularity of the museum, but not enough to shut it down. The exhibit attracted wealthy sadists and racists to torture Clayton to the limit of his virtual consciousness, turning him into an empty shell. This caused Nish's mother to take "a bottle of pills and a bottle of vodka". Haynes passes out, and Nish transfers his consciousness into Clayton's hologram. She pushes the electric chair simulation to its maximum, allowing Haynes to experience the full force of the torture and finally putting Clayton's consciousness to rest. Taking along with her the stuffed monkey and a "souvenir" of Haynes in eternal agony (thereby preserving a copy of his consciousness), and before returning to the car, Nish removes the device disabling the AC, which causes a [[Short circuit|short]]. Nish converses with her mother, who is revealed to share her consciousness with Nish, as Carrie did with Jack. Nish drives away, her mother shedding joyful tears as the museum is engulfed in flames.

==Production==
Whilst series one and two of ''Black Mirror'' were shown on [[Channel 4]] in the UK, in September 2015 Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-black-mirror-new-episodes-1201602037/|title='Black Mirror' Lands at Netflix |first=Debra |last=Birnbaum|journal=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2016 it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distribute the third series, with a bid of $40 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/29/netflix-channel-4-charlie-brooker-black-mirror |title=Netflix deals Channel 4 knockout blow over Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror |first=John |last=Plunkett |date=29 March 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 12-episode order was divided into two series of six episodes each.

[[File:Penn Jillette by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The first story in this episode was based on the short story "The Pain Addict", written by [[Penn Jillette]] in the 1980s.]]
The first story, involving Dr. Dawson, was based on a short story, "The Pain Addict", written by magician [[Penn Jillette]] early in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://heavy.com/entertainment/2017/12/penn-jilette-pain-addict-black-mirror-museum-buy/ | title = ‘Black Mirror’: All About Penn Jillette’s Pain Addict | first = Stephanie Dube | last = Dwilson | date = 29 December 2017 | accessdate = 1 January 2018 | work = [[Heavy.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jillette had written the story based on the personal experience of being ill in a Spanish welfare hospital in 1981, where it was difficult to get a diagnosis due to the language barrier. Jillette came up with "The Pain Addict" from this experience, where there would be technology that allowed a doctor to understand what pain a person was suffering, but, as described by Jillette "this guy gets addicted to it and starts beating people to feel their pain. He also goes through S&amp;M and all he wants to do is jack into Jesus on the cross. He wants to feel that pain."&lt;ref name="slashfilm jillette"/&gt; Jillette had planned to use the story in one of his first books along with his show partner [[Teller (magician)|Teller]], but the publisher rejected it for being too dark. Jillette had been trying to shop for a venue for this story, and brought up the idea when he had an opportunity to talk with Charlie Brooker. Around two years later, Brooker contacted Jillette to explain that "Black Museum" would be an anthology episode, and wanted to use "The Pain Addict" as part of it. Jillette allowed him to use the story, though Brooker did the necessary modifications for his show. Jillette then worked with Brooker to help suggest the idea of a framing story, which would involve a washed-up Las Vegas [[carny]] running the Black Museum outside of Vegas. Jillette wanted to audition for the role of the carny, but the production was too far along to change the casting.&lt;ref name="slashfilm jillette"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slashfilm.com/black-mirror-season-4-penn-jillette/ | title = ‘Black Mirror’ Season 4 Will Feature a Story Conceived by Penn Jillette | first = Jacob | last=  Hill | date = 22 May 2017 | accessdate = 1 January 2018 | work = [[/Film]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooker still took Jillette's past performances as part of Penn &amp; Teller and his documentary series ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|Bullshit!]]'' as inspiration for Rolo.&lt;ref name="ibm"&gt;{{cite book | title=  Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | chapter = Black Museum | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher =  [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode took a month to film; locations include [[Nevada]] and Spain.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onset-hollywood.com/black-mirror-black-museum-2017-filming-locations-netflix-original-series/|title=Black Mirror: Black Museum (2017) Filming Locations – Netflix Original Series|website=OnSetHollywood.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooker had previously looked to cast [[Letitia Wright]] in an episode of the third series of ''Black Mirror'', but she became unavailable. During the casting process for "Black Museum", Brooker considered Wright ideal for the run, but at the time she was finishing shooting on ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''. She was able to provide a self-tape audition with help from [[Daniel Kaluuya]], who had previously starred in "[[Fifteen Million Merits]]" and was co-starring with her in ''Black Panther''.&lt;ref name="ibm"/&gt;

[[Daniel Lapaine]] appears in this episode as Dr. Peter Dawson, after appearing in an unrelated role in the series one episode "[[The Entire History of You]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heavy.com/entertainment/2017/12/black-museum-cast-characters-black-mirror/|title=Black Museum: Meet the Cast from the Black Mirror Episode|work=[[Heavy.com|Heavy]]|last=Dwilson|first=Stephanie Dube|date=29 December 2017|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode is structured similarly to "[[White Christmas (Black Mirror)|White Christmas]]", a previous episode of ''Black Mirror'', as both feature three separately told stories that progress towards an overarching plot line by the end.&lt;ref&gt;https://heavy.com/entertainment/2017/12/black-museum-vs-white-christmas-which-better-poll/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
In May 2017, a [[Reddit]] post unofficially announced the names and directors of the six episodes in series 4 of ''Black Mirror''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/black-mirror-season-4-episode-titles-directors-charlie-brooker-netflix-jodie-foster-john-hillcoat-a7758786.html|title=Black Mirror season 4 episode titles and directors revealed|work=[[The Independent]]|last=Stolworthy|first=Jacob|date=27 May 2017|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first trailer for the series was released by Netflix on 25 August 2017, and contained the six episode titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/black-mirror-season-4-teaser-trailer-episode-titles-directors-stars-drop-video/|title='Black Mirror' Season 4: Teaser Trailer, Episode Titles, Directors and Stars Revealed (Video)|last=Donnelly|first=Matt|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=25 August 2017|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/black-mirror-season-4-netflix-teaser-trailer-youtube-episode-titles-a7912416.html|title=Black Mirror season 4 Netflix trailer teases all six episodes and their titles|work=[[The Independent]]|last=Hooton|first=Christopher|date=25 August 2017|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning on 24 November 2017, Netflix published a series of posters and trailers for the fourth series of the show, referred to as the "13 Days of ''Black Mirror''".&lt;ref name="THR cast"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/black-mirror-season-4-guide-premiere-date-trailer-cast-episode-titles-1061669|title='Black Mirror': All the Season 4 Details|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=Strause|first=Jackie|date=27 November 2017|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6, Netflix published a trailer featuring an amalgamation of scenes from the fourth series, which announced that the series would be released on 29 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://decider.com/2017/12/06/black-mirror-season-4-trailer/|title=Netflix Reveals 'Black Mirror' Season 4 Release Date In New Trailer|work=Decider|publisher=[[New York Post]]|last=White|first=Peter|date=6 December 2017|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Easter eggs===
"Black Museum" includes [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] references back to each previous ''Black Mirror'' episode, according to director Colm McCarthy; many were placed by set designer Joel Collins.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; Collins said that he wanted to make the set a "hidden celebration of six years of ''Black Mirror''".&lt;ref name="ibm"/&gt; For example, Jack is seen reading a "[[Fifteen Million Merits]]" comic, and the museum's entrance includes a screen showing a picture of Victoria Skillane and later a mannequin with a black balaclava and the white two-pronged symbol from "[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]". Many museum artefacts&lt;!--this is the proper spelling for British English - do not change--&gt; are taken from previous episodes, for instance: an autonomous drone insect (ADI) from "[[Hated in the Nation]]"; the lollipop Daly uses to clone Walton's son in "[[USS Callister]]"; the tablet used by Marie in "[[Arkangel (Black Mirror)|Arkangel]]"; the bloodied bathtub where Shazia's husband was murdered in "[[Crocodile (Black Mirror)|Crocodile]]". The two rats shown to Dawson by Haynes are named Kenny and Hector, referencing the characters from "[[Shut Up and Dance (Black Mirror)|Shut Up and Dance]]". The episode also makes multiple allusions to "[[San Junipero]]", featuring the company TCKR, naming a hospital Saint Juniper's and showing Yorkie and Kelly's dresses in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://heavy.com/entertainment/2017/12/black-museum-easter-eggs-photos-screenshots-mirror/ |title=Black Museum Easter Eggs: Photos of Every Black Mirror Episode Mentioned [SPOILERS] |last=Dwilson |first=Stephanie Dube |date=29 December 2017 |website=Heavy.com |access-date=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/black-mirror-season-4-black-museum-colm-mccarthy-directing-interview-1202640505/ | title = 'Black Mirror' Director on 'Black Museum': 'I Think There's Something Quite Spiritual About It' | first = Danielle | last = Turchiano | date = 29 December 2017 | accessdate = 1 January 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separately, one wall of the museum includes a number of [[Death mask|death masks]]; Brooker identified these as busts of the various crew that have worked on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-reveals-hang-dj-inspiration-1074803 | title = 'Black Mirror': Charlie Brooker Reveals Inspiration for "Hang the DJ" | first=  Jackie | last= Strause | date = 15 January 2018 | accessdate = 16 January 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Score===
[[Cristobal Tapia de Veer]] composed the music for the episode, which was released through [[Lakeshore Records]] on January 19, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tapia De Veer|first1=Cristobal|title=Black Mirror: Black Museum (Original Score)|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/id1333956953|website=iTunes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A music sampler was released earlier, December 27, 2017, on both his [[YouTube]] and [[SoundCloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tapia De Veer|first1=Cristobal|title=BLACK MIRROR / BLACK MUSEUM ost sampler ALBUM OUT NOW!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Rdn3VUzkUE|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tapia De Veer|first1=Cristobal|title=BLACK MIRROR / BLACK MUSEUM original score - music sampler ALBUM OUT NOW!!|url=https://soundcloud.com/cristobal-tapia-de-veer/black-mirror-black-museum-original-score-music-sampler|website=SoundCloud}}&lt;/ref&gt;

de Veer commented on the score, stating “The beginning, discovering the Black Museum, that was going to set the tone for the rest of the show. The music morphed in many ways throughout the three stories, then goes back to where it started with the Black Museum, although with a sense of accomplishment, but also a sense of doom.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barkan|first1=Jonathan|title=Exclusive: Venture Into Black Mirror’s Black Museum with Cristobal Tapia de Veer’s We Got a Miracle|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/264999/exclusive-venture-black-mirrors-black-museum-cristobal-tapia-de-veers-got-miracle/|website=Dead Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[File:Letitia Wright by Gage Skidmore.jpg|upright|right|thumb|[[Letitia Wright]] received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for her performance in the episode.]]
The episode received generally mixed reviews from critics. A ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' review stated the ending "seemed to retread old ground", but "given that there's nothing like ''Black Mirror'' on TV, it's a minor quibble."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nicholson|first1=Rebecca|title=Black Mirror review: the Netflix series is back – and darker than ever|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/29/black-mirror-review-netflix-series-back-darker-charlie-brooker|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=the Guardian|date=29 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review from ''[[The A.V.

Other critics were more positive. Tasha Robinson of ''[[The Verge]]'' stated "“Black Museum” keeps a potentially scattered story on track without digressing into generic complaints about modern culture."&lt;ref name=verge&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Tasha|title=In Black Museum, Black Mirror finally finds a single person to blame for technology|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/3/16845504/black-mirror-black-museum-review-netflix-season-4-douglas-hodge-letitia-wright|website=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Parham of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' commended the episode as "the most important of the season", writing "It’s a victory, and an ending that defies the natural biology of the series."&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jason|first1=Parham|title=WHY BLACK MIRROR'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL NEW EPISODE IS ITS MOST IMPORTANT|url=https://www.wired.com/story/black-mirror-black-museum/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noel Ransome in ''[[Vice Media|Vice]]'' judged that the episode provides him and other black viewers a rare sense of "satisfaction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=I'm a Black Critic Who Dismissed the ‘Black Museum’ Episode|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/59w53k/im-a-black-critic-who-dismissed-the-black-museum-episode|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=Vice|date=5 January 2018|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ''[[Independent (newspaper)|Independent]]'' review stated the three narratives were "engrossing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Black Museum' review: Black Mirror episodes collide in chilling, racially-charged climax|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/black-mirror-season-4-review-episode-black-museum-letitia-wright-rolo-haynes-a8132691.html|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=The Independent|date=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''[[NPR]]'' review called the episode "solid", though not as good as "USS Callister" and "Hang the DJ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Season 4 Of 'Black Mirror,' Power Corrupts, But Love Still Matters|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2017/12/29/572264537/in-season-4-of-black-mirror-power-corrupts-but-love-still-matters|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=NPR.org|date=29 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics were divided on whether they joined in with celebrating Nish's revenge. Parham approved her actions as "a way to fight for what you believe is right", while Gilbert rejected the "eye-for-eye justice" of Nish's deliberate torturing of Haynes.&lt;ref name=verge/&gt;&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

[[Image:Képes Krónika 1360.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The first page of the ''[[Chronicon Pictum]]''.]]

'''''Chronica Hungarorum''''' ('''Chronicle of the Hungarians''') is the title of several works treating the  early [[History of Hungary|Hungarian history]].

==''Chronicon Pictum''==
{{Main|Chronicon Pictum}}
The most famous of the variants is the ''Vienna Illuminated Chronicle'', i.e. the ''[[Chronicon Pictum]]'' (1358–1370, ed. S. Ladislaus Endlicher 1827), deriving the name from its magnificent illustrations and the fact that it was kept in the [[Austrian National Library|Viennese Imperial Library]].

==''Buda Chronicle''==
A popular chronicle partly based on the ''Chronicon Pictum'' (entitled just ''Chronica Hungarorum'') was circulated in a printed form. It is also known as the ''[[Buda Chronicle]]''. It was produced in 1473 by [[András Hess]] and is the first [[incunabulum]] ever printed in Hungary (Buda, [[András Hess]], 1473, 70 fol., 2º.)

It relates the history of [[Hungary]] from the earliest times to the coronation of [[King Matthias]]. Eleven copies of the chronicle are known to survive, two of them in Hungary: one in the [[National Széchényi Library]] and another in the [[Budapest University]] Library.

==Johannes de Thurocz==
The third chronicle entitled ''Chronica Hungarorum'', partly based on the ''Chronicon Pictum'', was produced by [[Johannes de Thurocz]] Hungarian: Thuróczy János, c.1435-90, ed. E. Galantai, J. Kristo, E. Malyusz, Budapest 1985-88), the first layman known to have written a book in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. 

This work ([[Brno]], 1488, Augusburg, 1488) presents events as seen by an educated nobleman. The chronicle is described in the article on the author.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3270">[[File:Conquests of Carlo I Tocco.svg|thumb|right|300px|Carlo I Tocco's territorial expansion on the Greek mainland]]
The '''''Chronicle of the Tocco''''' is a chronicle in [[Political verse|fifteen-syllable]] [[blank verse]] written in [[medieval Greek]]. It covers the period of 1375-1425 and focuses on the ascent of the [[Tocco family]], and especially [[Carlo I Tocco]], [[County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos|Count palatine]] of [[Cephalonia]] and [[Zakynthos]], to the rule over the [[Despotate of Epirus]], as well as Carlo's conquest of territories in the [[Morea]].

The author, who remains unknown, described events that occurred during his own lifetime and must have been present in some of them. He possibly belonged to the court of [[Carlo I Tocco]] and came from [[Ioannina]]. From the text we can deduce that he was not particularly educated since he was using simple language.

The author describes the Toccos as fair governors, who care for the rights of their people. It is remarkable, that he does not mention the Latin descent of the noble family. He appears to cultivate a sense of early Greek nationalism and to hate the Albanians. 

The ''Chronicle'' was published for the first time in 1975 by Giuseppe Schirò (''Cronaca dei Tocco di Cefalonia; prolegomeni, testo critico e traduzione'', [[Corpus Fontium Historiae Byzantinae]] 10. Rome: Accademia nazionale dei Lincei, 1975). It comprises 3923 verses and was found in the ''codex Vaticanus Graecus'' 1831. The beginning and the end of the text is missing. This codex was written before June 1429, possibly from the author, as G. Schirò believed. There is also a 16th-century copy of it, ''codex Vatic. gr.'' 2214. [[Elisabeth Zachariadou]] proved that the first pages of the codex were placed in a wrong order and suggested a different order for the first 1,000 verses, which makes the text more coherent and easier to understand.&lt;ref&gt;E. Zachariadou, "The first thousand verses in the beginning of the ''Chronicle of the Tocco'' (Ε. Ζαχαριάδου, «Οι χίλιοι στίχοι στην αρχή του ''Χρονικού των Τόκκων''»), ''Ipirotika Chronika'' (''Ηπειρωτικά Χρονικά'') 15 (1983) 158-181 (''in Greek'')&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Chronicle'', despite its unimportant literary quality, has significant value as an historical source, as well as a linguistic source for the language of that era.

== History ==
The founder, [[Brendan Ciecko]], started Cuseum in 2014 as a part of [[PayPal]] Start Tank in Boston, MA.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Prior to that he founded Ten Minute Media, a creative marketing agency focused on the music industry, for which he was named ''Cool, Determined &amp; Under 30'' by the [[Inc. (magazine)|Inc. Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/magazine/20081001/cool-determined-amp-under-30.html|title=Cool, Determined &amp; Under 30 -- young CEOs-- star entrepreneurs|last=Fenn|first=Donna|date=2008-10-01|work=Inc.com|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Cuseum joined the [[startup accelerator]] program [[Techstars]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techstars.com/content/blog/announcing-the-boston-class-of-2015/|title=Announcing the 12 Companies for the Boston 2015 Class - Techstars|date=2015-06-09|work=Techstars|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11568">'''Genotype to Phenotype Databases: a Holistic Approach''' ('''GEN2PHEN''') is a European project aiming to develop a knowledge web portal integrating information from the [[genotype]] to the [[phenotype]] in a unifying [http://www.gen2phen.org portal: The Knowledge Centre].&lt;ref&gt;http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1784/version/1/files/npre20081784-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/gkn748&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gen2phen.org/system/files/private/poster%20ESHG%20Vienna%202009%20ResID.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://open-bio.org/w/images/6/6e/17_BOSC2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iscb.org/uploaded/css/58/17288.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary and Objectives==
The GEN2PHEN project aims to unify human and model organism genetic variation databases towards increasingly holistic views into Genotype-To-Phenotype (G2P) data, and to link this system into other biomedical knowledge sources via genome browser functionality. The project will establish the technological building-blocks needed for the evolution of today’s diverse G2P databases into a future seamless G2P biomedical knowledge environment, by the projects end. This will consist of a European-centred but globally networked hierarchy of bioinformatics GRID-linked databases, tools and standards, all tied into the Ensembl genome browser. The project has the following specific objectives:
* To analyse the G2P field and thus determine emerging needs and practices
* To develop key standards for the G2P database field
* To create generic database components, services and integration infrastructures for the G2P database domain
* To create search modalities and data presentation solutions for G2P knowledge
* To facilitate the process of populating G2P databases
* To build a major G2P internet portal
* To deploy GEN2PHEN solutions to the community
* To address system durability and long-term financing
* To undertake a whole-system utility and validation pilot study
The GEN2PHEN Consortium members have been selected from a talented pool of European research groups and companies that are interested in the G2P database challenge. Additionally, a few non-EU participants have been included to bring extra capabilities to the initiative. The final constellation is characterised by broad and proven competence, a network of established working relationships, and high-level roles/connections within other significant projects in this domain...

==Background and Concept==
By providing a complete Homo sapiens ‘parts list’ (the gene sequences) and a powerful ‘toolkit’ (technologies), the Human Genome Project has revolutionised mankind’s ability to explore how genes cause disease and other phenotypes. Studies in this domain are proceeding at a rapid and ever-increasing pace, generating unprecedented amounts of raw and processed data. It is now imperative that the scientific community finds ways to effectively manage and exploit this flood of information for knowledge creation and practical benefit to society. This fundamental goal lies at the heart of the “Genotype-To-Phenotype Databases: A Holistic Solution (GEN2PHEN)” project.

Previous genetics studies have shown that inter-individual genome variation plays a major role in differential normal development and disease processes. However, the details of how these relationships work are far from clear, even in the case of most Mendelian disorders where single genetic alterations are fully penetrant (essentially causative, rather than risk modifying). Background genetic effects (modifier genes), epistasis, somatic variation, and environmental factors all complicate the situation. This is particularly the case in complex, multi-factorial disorders (e.g., cancer, heart disease, diabetes, dementia) that will affect most of us at some stage in our lifetime. Strategies do, however, now exist to study the genetics of these disorders, and such investigations are a major focus of research throughout Europe and beyond. A common thread in these studies is the need to create ever-larger datasets and integrate these more effectively.

Success in deciphering the mechanisms and pathways underpinning genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) relationships will bring about radical new opportunities for predicting, preventing, diagnosing, and treating all forms of illness. It will launch an era of truly effective personalised medicine. Extensive research is therefore being conducted worldwide to characterise genetic variation in normal and disease contexts. Sadly though, the resulting flood of primary information is not yet being managed or utilised as effectively as it should be - due simply to the lack of a sufficiently organised and mature database infrastructure by which the discoveries can be gathered, stored, integrated and queried as a composite whole in the electronic (internet) domain. Furthermore, whilst new positive findings are being handled sub-optimally, ‘negative’ observations are in most cases not even reported in any way, shape, or form – despite the fact that they constitute an essential part of any complete and accurate G2P depiction. This needs to change, and an international ‘Human Variome Project’ (HVP) has emerged to help argue this case.

It is against this backdrop that the GEN2PHEN project aims to become the key European contribution to the challenges listed above, harmonised with similar projects elsewhere, and dovetailed into many related European programmes of work. It will provide an important and timely solution to a current research need that was highlighted by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) - Priority area: ‘Upgrade of European Bio-Informatics Infrastructure (Shared platform for data resources in the Life Sciences)’. It will provide European G2P research and biotech industries with the proper support they need in terms of database technologies and data integration systems. Only then can our societies maximally benefit from the current exponentially increasing rate of genetic data generation in disease research and clinical settings.

==Future Vision and Current Reality==
Looking to the future, one can imagine a world wherein ‘omics’ biomedical sciences are commonplace, even to the point of having one’s genome sequenced in routine medical checkups. In this envisaged world, phenomenally large amounts of G2P data will be produced daily, much of which would flow effortlessly into the internet to be fully absorbed into a sophisticated and powerful ‘biomedical knowledge environment’. Some of this information will be secured for restricted access, whilst much of the raw data and the derived knowledge should be free for everyone to search and exploit.

The system will enable extensive scientific reporting and discussions, it will provide a core reference platform for medical practice, and it will open exciting new operational vistas for journals, industry, and funders. It will provide for and underpin activities in biomedical research, biotechnology, drug development, and personalised healthcare. And it will probably even impact our basic cultural practices (e.g., insurance, the law, employment policies) as society comes to grips with the immense power and relevance of genetics to the human state. But this envisaged future is nothing like the world we presently live in.

No system yet exists that even begins to approximate to a ‘biomedical knowledge environment’ properly able to support G2P data gathering and analysis. There are instead a limited number of unconnected G2P databases that are mostly at rather early stages in their development, with no agreed structured way of effectively modelling phenotype data or G2P relationships, and no convenient mode for passing data from discovery laboratories into the database world. A few recent initiatives are building large databases to host individual-specific genotypes and phenotypes to support some high-throughput disease association studies, but these do not have a global remit, have not engaged with the extensive existing knowledge from Medelian disorders, and are not focused on all the research and clinical communities around G2P. Most progress has arguably been made with locus-specific databases (LSDBs) that target specific diseases or genes, but the vast majority of the several hundred LSDBs that do exist are rudimentary in design and implementation, and operationally isolated from one another. This all contrasts with the situation for databases concerned with purely genetic data (without phenotype association), of which there are many, including several large data warehouses and genome browsers that act as central repositories and search centres for all the human and model organism genome sequences, variants, and feature annotations yet produced.

There are a number of reasons why the G2P database field is so poorly developed. Problems include the complexity/diversity of the pertinent data elements, the contemporary nature of the challenge, and certain practical/cultural issues. However, perhaps the most critical obstacle is the overwhelming scale of the problem. Whereas the genome is a bounded domain of only ~3,000,000,000 nucleotides and ~25,000 genes (in man), there is essentially no limit to the number of G2P relationships that can be examined, each by multiple different procedures. The former is thus relatively straightforward and can be managed and hosted in one or a few large data depositories (as has been accomplished). In contrast, the latter is too large in scale and scope to handle in this way.

There is virtually no limit to how many G2P data will eventually be created, or to their diversity or purpose. The database solutions for G2P information must therefore be based upon new ways of thinking and organising the field’s development - emphasising standards, integration, federation, and broad community participation from the very outset.

'''''Guinness World Records Smashed''''' was a British television show for [[Sky1]], that featured [[world record|record]] attempts, celebrity guests and death-defying stunts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlineproductions.co.uk/catalogue_detail.aspx?program=630 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920102046/http://www.outlineproductions.co.uk/catalogue_detail.aspx?program=630 |date=20 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A one-off pilot episode was transmitted on 23 November 2008, and a full 10-part series was broadcast on Sky1 from 19 April to 21 June 2009. The show was produced by British independent production company, Outline Productions with [[Guinness World Records]].

==Filming==
The pilot show was recorded in October 2008 at [[Teddington Studios]] and around [[London]] and invited people to partake in the filming to attempt to break existing world records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/sky1/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107114223/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/sky1/ |date=7 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the back of the November 2008 one-off programme, Sky1 ordered a 10-part series. The studio format invited members of the public to try to set new world records in everything from leaping through burning hoops to somersaulting over cars. Celebrity guests, the audience, and the presenters also got involved with the record-breaking attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/commissioning/interview/2009/02/sky_1_hands_guinness_world_records_show_an_11part_run.html |title=Sky 1 hands Guinness World Records show an 11-part run &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Broadcast |publisher=Broadcastnow.co.uk |date=4 February 2009 |accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series started airing on Sky1 and Sky1 HD on Sunday 19 April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlineproductions.co.uk/catalogue_detail.aspx?program=776 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503082450/http://www.outlineproductions.co.uk/catalogue_detail.aspx?program=776 |date=3 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filmed from February 2009, the studio show has been filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinewoodgroup.com/gen/z_sys_storyNews.aspx?intNewsId=201 |title=News &amp;#124; Pinewood&amp;nbsp;— Film studio facilities &amp; services |publisher=Pinewoodgroup.com |date= |accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It stars [[Sam Neill]], [[Julie Carmen]], [[Jürgen Prochnow]], [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] and [[Charlton Heston]].

&lt;!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. Plot summaries should not exceed 700 words. --&gt;
In the midst of an unspecified disaster, Dr. Wrenn ([[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]]) visits John Trent ([[Sam Neill]]), a patient in a psychiatric hospital, and Trent recounts his story:

Trent, a freelance insurance investigator, has lunch with a colleague, an owner of an insurance company, who asks Trent to work on his largest insured: investigating a claim by New York-based Arcane Publishing. During their conversation, Trent is attacked by a man wielding an axe who, after asking him if he reads Sutter Cane, is shot dead by a police officer before he can harm Trent. The man was Cane's agent, who went insane and killed his family after reading one of Cane's books.

Trent meets with Arcane Publishing director Jackson Harglow ([[Charlton Heston]]), who tasks him with investigating the disappearance of popular horror novelist Sutter Cane ([[Jürgen Prochnow]]), and recovering the manuscript for Cane's final novel. He assigns Cane's editor, Linda Styles ([[Julie Carmen]]), to accompany him. Linda explains that Cane's stories have been known to cause disorientation, memory loss and paranoia in "less stable readers". Trent is skeptical, convinced that the disappearance is a publicity stunt. Trent notices red lines on Cane's book's covers which, when aligned properly, form the outline of [[New Hampshire]] and mark a location alluded to be Hobb's End, the fictional setting for many of Cane's works.

They set out to find the town. Linda experiences bizarre phenomena during the late-night drive, and they inexplicably arrive at Hobb's End in daylight. Trent and Linda search the small town, encountering people and landmarks described as fictional in Cane's novels. Trent believes it all to be staged, but Linda disagrees. She admits to Trent that Arcane Publishing's claim was a stunt to promote Cane's book, but the time distortion and exact replica of Hobb's End were not part of the plan.

Linda enters a church to confront Cane, who exposes her to his final novel, ''In the Mouth of Madness'', which drives her insane; she begins embracing and kissing Cane passionately. A man ([[Wilhelm von Homburg]]) approaches Trent in a bar and warns him to leave, then commits suicide. Outside the bar, a mob of monstrous-looking townspeople descend upon him. Trent drives away from Hobb's End, but is repeatedly teleported back to the center of town. After crashing his car, Trent awakens inside the church with Linda, where Cane explains that the public's belief in his stories freed an ancient race of monstrous beings which will reclaim the Earth. Cane reveals that Trent is merely one of his characters, who must follow Cane's plot and return the manuscript of ''In The Mouth of Madness'' to Arcane Publishing, furthering the end of humanity.

After giving Trent the manuscript, Cane tears his face open, creating a portal to the dimension of Cane's monstrous masters. Trent sees a long tunnel that Cane said would take him back to his world, and urges Linda to come with him. She tells him she can't, because she has already read the entire book. Trent races down the hall, with Cane's monsters close on his heels. He trips and falls, then suddenly finds himself lying on a country road, apparently back in reality. During his return to New York, Trent destroys the manuscript. Back at Arcane Publishing, Trent relates his experience to Harglow. Harglow claims ignorance of Linda; Trent was sent alone to find Cane, and the manuscript was delivered months earlier. ''In the Mouth of Madness'' has been on sale for weeks, with a [[Novel adaptation|film adaptation]] in [[post production]]. Trent encounters a reader of the newly released novel, who is bleeding from his altered eyes. Trent asks if he is enjoying the book, and when the dazed reader nods, Trent tells him he should not be surprised before swinging the axe.  Trent is arrested for the murder.

After Trent finishes telling his story, Dr. Wrenn judges it a meaningless hallucination. Trent wakes the following day to find the asylum abandoned. He departs as a radio announces that the world has been overrun with monstrous creatures, including mutating humans, and that outbreaks of suicide and mass murder are commonplace. Trent goes to see the ''In the Mouth of Madness'' film and discovers that he is the main character. As he watches his previous actions play out on screen, including a scene where he insisted to Linda "This is reality!", Trent begins laughing hysterically before breaking down crying; finally realizing he was a character in the book all along.

Michael De Luca wrote the script in the late 1980s and one of the first directors he offered it to was John Carpenter,&lt;ref name="mouth"/&gt; who initially passed on the project.  New Line Cinema later announced production in 1989 with director [[Tony Randel]] attached to direct.&lt;ref name="mouth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://originalvidjunkie.blogspot.com/2015/02/newsploitation-in-mouth-of-box-office.html|title=Newsploitation: In the Mouth of Box Office Sadness|work=Video Junkie|last=Wilson|first=William S.|accessdate=2015-02-03|date=2015-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later [[Mary Lambert (director)|Mary Lambert]] was also attached to direct.&lt;ref name="mouth"/&gt;  A few years later, Carpenter signed on as director in December 1992 and filming took place from August to October 1993.&lt;ref name="mouth"/&gt;

The town scenes in Hobb's End were filmed on [[Main Street Unionville]], and the exterior of the Black Church is actually the [[Cathedral of the Transfiguration (Markham)|Cathedral of the Transfiguration]].

=== Influences ===
{{original research|section|date=January 2017}}
The film pays [[tribute]] to the work of seminal horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]], with many references to his stories and themes. Its title is a play on Lovecraft's novella, ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'', and [[insanity]] plays as great a role in the film as it does in Lovecraft's fiction. The opening scene depicts Trent's confinement to an [[psychiatric hospital|asylum]], with the bulk of the story told in [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]], a common technique of Lovecraft's. Reference is made to Lovecraftian settings and details (such as a character that shares the name of Lovecraft's [[Pickman's Model|Pickman]] family).  Sutter Cane's novels have similar titles to H.P. Lovecraft stories : ''The Whisperer of the Dark'' (''The Whisperer in Darkness''), ''The Thing in the Basement'' (''The Thing on the Doorstep''), ''Haunter out of Time'' (''The Haunter of the Dark''/''The Shadow Out of Time''), etc.

The film can also be seen as a reference to [[Stephen King]], who, like Lovecraft, writes horror fiction set in New England hamlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://secure.deseretnews.com/movies/review/1,5208,864,00.html | title=Deseret News: In the Mouth of Madness Review | author=Chris Hicks | date=1995-02-07 | accessdate=2010-01-03 | publisher=Deseret News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deep-focus.com/flicker/inthemou.html] {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; King is mentioned towards the beginning of the movie; it is suggested that Cane's work is more frightening than King's and outsells it.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3921">'''Infrahumanisation''' (or '''infrahumanization''') is the tacitly held belief that one's [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]] is more [[human]] than an outgroup, which is less human. The term was coined by Jacques-Philippe Leyens and colleagues in the early 2000s to distinguish what they argue to be an everyday phenomenon from [[dehumanization]] (denial of humanness) associated with extreme intergroup violence such as [[genocide]]. According to Leyens and colleagues, infrahumanisation arises when people view their ingroup and outgroup as essentially different ([[essentialism|different in essence]]) and accordingly reserve the "human essence" for the ingroup and deny it to the outgroup. Whether a "subhuman" classification means "human but inferior" or "not human at all" may be academic, as in practice it corresponds to prejudice regardless (for example, compare the [[Nazism and race|Nazi idea]] of the [[Untermensch]]).

The belief that the outgroup is less human than the ingroup is seldom consciously endorsed by individuals and instead is reflected in the way people tacitly think about the outgroup. Researchers have typically investigated infrahumanisation by looking at the types of [[emotion]]s people believe ingroup and outgroup members possess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Leyens, J. Ph., Paladino, M. P., Rodriguez, R. T., Vaes, J., Demoulin, S., Rodriguez, A. P., &amp; Gaunt, R.|year=2000|title=The emotional side of prejudice : The attribution of secondary emotions to ingroups and outgroups|journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Review]] |volume=4|pages=186&amp;ndash;197| doi=10.1207/S15327957PSPR0402_06|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some emotions are considered unique to humans (e.g., love, regret, nostalgia), whereas others are viewed as common to both humans and animals (e.g., joy, anger, sadness). In a series of studies, Leyens and colleagues have widely replicated the finding that people attribute uniquely human emotions to the ingroup, but not the outgroup. According to infrahumanisation theory, the denial of uniquely human emotions to the outgroup is reflective of the belief that they are less human than the ingroup.

Recent research has investigated how infrahumanisation influences behaviour. In a series of studies, Jeroen Vaes and his colleagues investigated people's reactions to outgroup members who attempt to "humanise" themselves through the use of uniquely human emotions. They found that ingroup members reacted negatively to outgroup members' attempts to humanise, offering less help and withdrawing faster than when the same uniquely human emotion was expressed by an ingroup member ''or'' when the outgroup member expressed a non-uniquely human emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Vaes., J|year=2004|title= On the behavioural consequences of infra-humanization: The implicit role of uniquely human emotions in intergroup relations |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|volume=85|pages=1016&amp;ndash;1034|pmid=14674811|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.6.1016|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} In an American context, Cuddy and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Cuddy, A., Rock, M., &amp; Norton, M. |year=2007|title= Aid in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina: Inferences of secondary emotions and intergroup helping |journal=[[Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations]]|volume=10|pages=107&amp;ndash;118|doi= 10.1177/1368430207071344}}&lt;/ref&gt; have investigated the influence of infrahumanisation on intergroup helping behaviour. Examining helping in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Cuddy et al. found that people believed outgroup members experienced less negative uniquely human emotions than ingroup members. The more participants infrahumanised the outgroup member, the less likely they were to help.

'''John Hendley Barnhart''' (October 4, 1871 – November 11, 1949) was an American botanist and author, specializing in biographies of botanists.&lt;ref name="gleaston"&gt;Gleaston, H. A. John Hendley Barnhart—An appreciation. ''[[Journal of the New York Botanical Garden]]'' August, 1950 p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Barnhart was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York to John Wesley Barnhart and Emma Miller Barnhart.&lt;ref&gt;1900 US Federal census, New York &gt; Westchester &gt; Greenburgh &gt; District 0072 &gt; 30&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Wesleyan University]] in [[Middletown, Connecticut]], receiving an A.B. in 1892 and an A.M. the following year.  In 1896 he graduated from [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] receiving an M.D., though he never practiced medicine.&lt;ref name="NYHT Barnhart obituary"&gt;J.H. Barnhart Dies; Botanical Garden Official. New York Herald Tribune, 12 Nov 1949&lt;/ref&gt;  His decision not to practice medicine was apparently made possible by substantial private income.&lt;ref name="Rickett article"&gt;Rickett, H.W.  John Hendley Barnhart, Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, 77:163-175, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

1897 found him in Jessamine, Florida where he married Emma Gertrude Platt of Southampton, New York.&lt;ref name="Rickett article"/&gt;  The couple lived in Tarrytown, New York, eventually moving to the Bronx in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;1920 US Federal census, New York &gt; Bronx &gt; Bronx Assembly District 8 &gt; District 445 &gt; 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1903 he became an editorial assistant at the library of the [[New York Botanical Garden]] (NYBG).{{cn|date=June 2016}} 
1905 saw the first appearance of ''North American Flora'', written by [[Nathaniel Lord Britton]] and Lucien Marcus Underwood.{{cn|date=June 2016}}  Barnhart was responsible for reviews of manuscripts including proof-reading and bibliographic correction. Barnhart developed a style of taxonomic citation, which is still used in the Index to American Botanical Literature.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

In 1907 he became NYBG librarian when [[Anna Murray Vail]], its first librarian, retired. From 1908 to 1926, and again in 1932 he was appointed NYBG library vice president.&lt;ref name="nyt1935"&gt;Staff report (September 1, 1935). Garden notes and topics. [[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; During the 5 years of his tenure as librarian, the number of bound volumes increased by 20%.  He also gave his personal library of 1900 items including many rare volumes.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

In January 1913, Barnhart was made Bibliographer of the Garden, a title he would keep for 30 years. His principal responsibility in this capacity was ''North American Flora''. It was during this period that he created the "Barnhart bibliographic file" consisting of about 50,000 cards with bibliographic information and formed the basis of his biographical books.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

In 1916, he became one of the two founding editors of the Garden's new botanical journal ''[[Addisonia (journal)|Addisonia]]'', along with [[George Valentine Nash]].{{cn|date=June 2016}}

Barnhart kept a careful record of his own publications, creating a separate card catalog for them.  A complete listing of his publications appeared in the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club, volume 77, pages 167 - 175.  

==Final Years==

Barnhart retired from the NYBG in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Famed Horticulturist Dies on Long Island.  The New Milford Times, 23 November 1949&lt;/ref&gt;  He died in his home in Southampton, Long Island and was survived by his widow.  Interment was in the family plot at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Newburgh, NY.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. John H. Barnart, Southampton Press, 18 Nov 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

'''La Vieille Taupe''' is a publishing house and bookshop in [[Paris]], [[France]]. The establishment went through two distinct phases in its history. Between 1965 and 1972, it had a politically [[Ultra-leftism|ultra left]] slant. In 1980 a project with the same name was launched by one of La Vieille Taupe's previous participants and became renowned for publishing [[antisemitic]] and [[Holocaust denial]] literature.

== Ultra-Left origins==
The name means ''Old Mole'' and comes from a communist conception of the maturation of social forces beneath the surface of society which eventually erupt in revolutionary movements. The bookshop was founded in 1965 at 1, rue des Fossés-Saint-Jacques, Paris 5eme. It was the major source for texts by the [[Situationist International]], [[Amadeo Bordiga]] and other [[ultra-left]] groups. Marx's [[Theses on Feuerbach]] were available as a poster thanks to [[Guy Debord]]. The situationists did much of the fly postering and along with [[Pouvoir Ouvrier]] who turned up for the opening party.

In 1966 the Situationists fell out with '''La Vieille Taupe''' and withdrew their publications. The bookshop continued as a focus of ultraleft activity until its closure in 1972. In 1973 La Vieille Taupe published ''La gauche allemande: Textes du [[KAPD]], de L'AAUD, de L'AAUE et de la KAI (1920-1922) ''with La Vecchia Talpa (Naples) and [[Invariance (journal)|Invariance]].

==Holocaust denial revival==
In 1979 [[Pierre Guillaume]] approached [[Gérard Lebovici]] with a proposal to publish the [[Holocaust denial]] text ''Le Mensonge d'Ulysse'' by [[Paul Rassinier]]. Lebovici refused, so in 1980 Guillaume relaunched '''''La Vieille Taupe''''' as a negationist publishing house. Rassiner's book was the first published. Many of Guillaume's former associates deplore his reuse of the name for a purpose they regard as completely at odds with their former involvement. Some also regard Guillaume's suggestion that [[Guy Debord]] was a secret negationist as obscene. Some people view ultra-left negationism as evidence that the ultra-left and ultra-right are very similar - the meeting of the extremes. However most ultra left activists would distance themselves from all forms of negationism, and regard Guillaume's more recent development as a sad decline. Guillaume sees '''''La Vieille Taupe''''' as a genuine ultra left venture which concentrates on "exposing the lies of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] victors of the [[Second World War]]", even if most of the people who listen to him are from the [[far-right]].

'''MacIndoe v Mainzeal Group Ltd''' [1991] 3 NZLR 273 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the legal enforcebility of a [[contract]]  where there is a breach of a stipulation.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
MacIndoe purchased a stratum title in a property development from Mainzeal, with payments to be paid by instalments.

Clause 8 of the sale agreement made making time of the essence to pay the instalments.

MacIndoe was later late on paying an instalment, and as a result, Mainzeal cancelled the contract.

==Held==
Given that paying the instalment on time was an essential part of the contract, Mainzeal were entitled to treat the contract as being repudiated.

[[File:The Mainz Psalter, 1457.jpg|thumb|The ''Mainz Psalter'' (1457) of [[George III]], rebound in 1800]]
[[File:Inkunabel.ValMax.finis.detail.jpg|thumb|[[Printer's mark]] of Johann Fust and Peter Schoeffer]]
The '''''Mainz Psalter''''' was the second major book printed with [[movable type]] in the West;&lt;ref name="Ikeda"&gt;{{cite book | author=Ikeda, Mayumi | chapter=The first experiments in printing at the Fust-Schöffer press | pages=39–49 | editor=Wagner, Bettina |editor2=Reed, Marcia | title=Early Printed Books as Material Objects: Proceedings of the Conference Organized by the Ifla Rare Books and Manuscripts Section Munich, 19–21 August 2009 | publisher=De Gruyter Sur | year=2010 |isbn=978-3-11-025324-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first was the [[Gutenberg Bible]]. It is a [[psalter]] commissioned by the [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz archbishop]] in 1457.   The Psalter introduced several innovations: it was the first book to feature a printed date of publication, a printed [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]], two sizes of type, printed decorative initials, and the first to be printed in three colours.&lt;ref name="Ikeda"/&gt; The colophon also contains the first example of a [[printer's mark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=William|title=Printers' Marks, by|year=1893|publisher=London: George Bell &amp; Sons, York Street, Covent Garden, &amp; New York.|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/25663}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first important publication issued by [[Johann Fust]] and [[Peter Schoeffer]] following their split from [[Johannes Gutenberg]].

==Description==
The Psalter combines printed text with two-colour [[woodcut]]s: since both woodcuts and movable print are relief processes, they could be printed together on the same press.  The Psalter is printed using black and red inks, with two-colour initials, and large coloured capitals printed in blue and red inks.&lt;ref name="royalcollection.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?object=1071478&amp;row=0&amp;detail=about |title=The Mainz Psalter |publisher=Royal Collection |date= |accessdate=2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These capitals were partly the work of the artisan known as the Fust master, who later also worked for Fust and Schöffer on the 1462 Bible.&lt;ref name="Ikeda"/&gt; The musical score accompanying the psalms was provided in [[manuscript]], and may have been the model for the type style.&lt;ref name="royalcollection.org.uk"/&gt; Printing in two colors, although feasible on the moveable press of Gutenberg's time (as illustrated by the Mainz Psalter), was apparently abandoned soon afterward as being too time-consuming, as few other examples of such a process are extant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=André Horch |url=http://www.gutenberg-museum.de/index.php?id=74&amp;language=e |title=Gutenberg-Museum Mainz: Veranstaltungsüberblick |publisher=Gutenberg-museum.de |date= |accessdate=2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two versions were printed, the short issue and long issue.  The short has 143 leaves, and the long has 175 and was intended for use in the [[diocese]] of Mainz. All surviving copies and fragments are on [[vellum]], and it is not known if any paper copies were printed.&lt;ref name="istc.bl.uk"&gt;[http://istc.bl.uk/search/search.html?operation=record&amp;rsid=1431424&amp;q=2] Incunabula Short Title Catalogue accessed 3 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; At least one copy was still being used in services in a monastery in the mid-eighteenth century.&lt;ref name = "Jensen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jensen |first = Kristian | title = Revolution and the Antiquarian Book : Reshaping the Past, 1780-1815 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2011 |isbn = 978-1107000513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
The Psalter is the earliest European book with a printed date of publication, though not the first printed book to feature a date associated with its production: in August 1456 the binder and [[rubrication|rubricator]] of a copy of the Gutenberg Bible added handwritten dates to show when these tasks were completed.&lt;ref&gt;Clausen Books, [http://clausenbooks.com/gutenbergcensus.htm Gutenberg Bible Census] accessed 3 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The colophon can be translated as follows:
*''This volume of the Psalms, adorned with a magnificence of capital letters and clearly divided by rubrics, has been fashioned by a mechanical process of printing and producing characters, without use of a pen, and it was laboriously completed, for God's Holiness, by Joachim Fust, citizen of Mainz, and Peter Schoeffer of [[Gernsheim]], on [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption Eve]] [August 14] in the year of Our Lord, 1457.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Connections (TV series)]], "Connections" by [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]], p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

New editions, using the same type, were printed in 1459 (dated August 29), 1490, 1502 (Schöffer's last publication) and 1516.

==Surviving copies==
It is "the second printed book ever published, and the first with rubricated (red as well as black) printing". There are only ten copies in existence, and as such, this book is rarer than the Gutenberg Bible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rct.uk/collection/about-the-collection/the-royal-library-and-royal-archives/a-history-of-the-royal-library/early-printed-books-manuscripts-fine-bindings-and-private-presses | title = Early printed books, manuscripts, fine bindings and private presses: incunabula | website = rct.uk/collection/ | language = en | access-date = Oct 26, 2018 | archive-url = | archive-date = Oct 26, 2018 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Friedrich Max Müller''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈmaks ˈmʏlɐ}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Max_maennlicher_Vorname|title=Duden {{!}} Max {{!}} Rechtschreibung, Bedeutung, Definition|work=[[Duden]]|quote=Mạx|accessdate=20 October 2018|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6 December 1823&amp;nbsp;– 28 October 1900), generally known as '''Max Müller''', was a [[German Confederation|German]]-born [[philologist]] and [[oriental studies|Orientalist]], who lived and studied in Britain for most of his life. He was one of the founders of the western academic field of [[Indology|Indian studies]] and the discipline of [[comparative religion]].&lt;ref name="gifford_bio"&gt;Sara Abraham and Brannon Hancock, doctoral students of theology in University of Glasgow [http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=127 ''Friedrich Max Muller'']. Gifford Lectures.&lt;/ref&gt; Müller wrote both scholarly and popular works on the subject of [[Indology]]. The ''[[Sacred Books of the East]]'', a 50-volume set of English translations, was prepared under his direction. He also promoted the idea of a [[Turanian languages|Turanian]] family of languages.

==Early life and education==
Friedrich Max Müller was born into a cultured family on 6 December 1823 in [[Dessau]], the son of [[Wilhelm Müller]], a [[Lyric poetry|lyric poet]] whose verse [[Franz Schubert]] had set to music in his song-cycles ''[[Die schöne Müllerin]]'' and ''[[Winterreise]]''. His mother, Adelheid Müller (née von Basedow), was the eldest daughter of a prime minister of [[Anhalt-Dessau]]. [[Carl Maria von Weber]] was a [[godparent|godfather]].&lt;ref name="ODNB2007"&gt;R. C. C. Fynes (May 2007), ''Müller, Friedrich Max (1823–1900)'', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18394], accessed 17 March 2013] {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Müller was named after his mother's elder brother, Friedrich, and after the central character, Max, in Weber's opera ''[[Der Freischütz]]''. Later in life, he adopted Max as a part of his surname, believing that the prevalence of Müller as a name made it too common.&lt;ref name="ODNB2007" /&gt; His name was also recorded as "Maximilian" on several official documents (e.g. university register, marriage certificate),{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} on some of his honours&lt;ref name="belles-lettres"&gt;[http://www.aibl.fr/membres/academiciens-depuis-1663/?lang=fr ''Académiciens depuis 1663'']. Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres.&lt;/ref&gt; and in some other publications.&lt;ref name="Johnston1900"&gt;Charles Johnston (1900) [https://archive.org/details/americanmonthly12shawgoog ''An Estimate of Max Muller (1823–1900)'']. ''[[The American Monthly Review of Reviews]]'', Vol XXII, July–December. The Review of Reviews Company: New York, pp.703–706.&lt;/ref&gt;

Müller entered the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (grammar school) at Dessau when he was six years old. In 1839, after the death of his grandfather, he was sent to the Nicolai School at [[Leipzig]], where he continued to his studies of music and classics. It was during his time in Leipzig that he frequently met [[Felix Mendelssohn]].&lt;ref name="ODNB2007" /&gt;

In need of a scholarship to attend [[Leipzig University]], Müller successfully sat his [[abitur]] examination at [[Zerbst]]. While preparing, he found that the syllabus differed from what he had been taught, necessitating that he rapidly learn mathematics, modern languages and science.&lt;ref name="ODNB2007" /&gt; He entered Leipzig University in 1841 to study philology, leaving behind his early interest in music and poetry. Müller received his [[Academic degree#Germany|degree]] in 1843. His final dissertation was on [[Spinoza]]'s ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''.&lt;ref name="gifford_bio"/&gt; He also displayed an aptitude for classical languages, learning [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit]].

==Academic career==
{{wikisource|Max Müller's submission to the members of Convocation of the University of Oxford, 1860|Max Müller's submission for the Boden Professorship election}}
In 1850 Müller was appointed deputy [[Taylor Institution|Taylorian]] professor of modern European languages at [[Oxford University]]. In the following year, at the suggestion of [[Thomas Gaisford]], he was made an honorary M.A. and a member of the college of [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. On succeeding to the full professorship in 1854, he received the full degree of M.A. by [[Decree of Convocation]]. In 1858 he was elected to a life fellowship at [[All Souls' College]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Max Müller, Friedrich (DNB01)|Dictionary of National Biography, 1901 supplement]].&lt;/ref&gt;

He was defeated in the [[Boden Professor of Sanskrit election, 1860|1860 election for the Boden Professor of Sanskrit]], which was a "keen disappointment" to him.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Georgina (1902), ''The Life and Letters of Right Honorable Friedrich Max Müller''. Vol 1. London: Longman, pp. 241–242&lt;/ref&gt; Müller was far better qualified for the post than the other candidate ([[Monier Monier-Williams]]), but his broad theological views, his Lutheranism, his German birth and lack of practical first-hand knowledge of India told against him. After the election he wrote to his mother, "all the best people voted for me, the Professors almost unanimously, but the ''vulgus profanum'' made the majority".&lt;ref&gt;Müller (1902) ''The Life and Letters,'' p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1868, Müller became Oxford's first [[Diebold Professor of Comparative Philology|Professor of Comparative Philology]], a position founded on his behalf. He held this chair until his death, although he retired from its active duties in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Harmsworth Encyclopaedia: Everybody's Book of Reference : containing 50,000 articles, profusely illustrated, Volume 6|author = George Sandeman|publisher = The Amalgamated Press|page = 4042}} Originally from New York Public Library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly and literary works==

===Sanskrit studies===
In 1844, prior to commencing his academic career at Oxford, Müller studied in [[Berlin]] with [[Friedrich Schelling]]. He began to translate the ''[[Upanishads]]'' for Schelling, and continued to research Sanskrit under [[Franz Bopp]], the first systematic scholar of the [[Indo-European languages]] (IE). Schelling led Müller to relate the history of language to the history of religion. At this time, Müller published his first book, a German translation of the [[Hitopadesha|''Hitopadesa'']], a collection of Indian [[fable]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Fifty Key Thinkers on Language and Linguistics|author = Margaret Thomas|page = 109|publisher = Routledge|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0415373029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845 Müller moved to Paris to study Sanskrit under [[Eugène Burnouf]]. Burnouf encouraged him to publish the complete [[Rigveda]], making use of the manuscripts available in England. He moved to England in 1846 to study [[Sanskrit]] texts in the collection of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]]. He supported himself at first with creative writing, his novel ''German Love'' being popular in its day.

Müller's connections with the East India Company and with Sanskritists based at [[Oxford University]] led to a career in Britain, where he eventually became the leading intellectual commentator on the [[culture of India]]. At the time, Britain controlled this territory as part of its Empire. This led to complex exchanges between Indian and British intellectual culture, especially through Müller's links with the [[Brahmo Samaj]].

Müller's Sanskrit studies came at a time when scholars had started to see language development in relation to cultural development. The recent discovery of the Indo-European language group had started to lead to much speculation about the relationship between [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Roman]] cultures and those of more ancient peoples. In particular the [[Vedas|Vedic]] culture of [[India]] was thought to have been the ancestor of European Classical cultures. Scholars sought to compare the genetically related European and Asian languages to reconstruct the earliest form of the root-language. The Vedic language, [[Sanskrit]], was thought to be the oldest of the IE languages.

Müller devoted himself to the study of this language, becoming one of the major Sanskrit scholars of his day. He believed that the earliest documents of Vedic culture should be studied to provide the key to the development of [[Paganism|pagan]] European religions, and of religious belief in general. To this end, Müller sought to understand the most ancient of Vedic scriptures, the ''[[Rig-Veda]].'' Müller was greatly impressed by [[Ramakrishna Paramhansa]], his contemporary and proponent of [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] philosophy, and wrote several essays and books about him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vedanta-newyork.org/articles/on_sri_ramakrishna.htm#muller|title=Vedanta Society of New York: Ramakrishna|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916163215/http://www.vedanta-newyork.org/articles/on_sri_ramakrishna.htm#muller|archivedate=16 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Friedrich Max-Müller by George Frederic Watts.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of the elderly Max Müller by [[George Frederic Watts]], 1894–1895]]
For Müller, the study of the language had to relate to the study of the culture in which it had been used. He came to the view that the development of languages should be tied to that of belief-systems. At that time the Vedic scriptures were little-known in the West, though there was increasing interest in the philosophy of the [[Upanishads]]. Müller believed that the sophisticated Upanishadic philosophy could be linked to the primitive [[henotheism]] of early Vedic Brahmanism from which it evolved. He had to travel to London to look at documents held in the collection of the [[British East India Company]]. While there he persuaded the company to allow him to undertake a critical edition of the Rig-Veda, a task he pursued over many years (1849–1874).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Sayana, Volume 203|author = B. R. Modak|publisher = Sahitya Akademi|isbn = 9788172019402|page=33|year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the critical edition for which he is most remembered.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}. ''Scientific American'' carried his obituary in the December 8th, 1900 edition of the magazine. It was revealed that Max Muller had in fact usurped the full credit for the translation of the Rig veda which was actually not his work at all, but of another unnamed german scholar whom Muller had paid to translate the text. To quote from his obituary in ''Scientific American'', "What he constantly proclaimed to be his own great work, the edition of the "Rig Veda," was in reality not his at all. A German scholar did the work, and Muller appropriated the credit for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000018628364;view=1up;seq=369;size=300|title=Scientific American.  v.50.|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Müller, the culture of the Vedic peoples represented a form of [[nature worship]], an idea clearly influenced by Romanticism. Müller shared many of the ideas associated with [[Romanticism]], which coloured his account of ancient religions, in particular his emphasis on the formative influence on early religion of emotional communion with natural forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O-7xYYt0oJsC&amp;lpg=PA336&amp;dq=max%20muller%20romanticism&amp;pg=PA336#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Studying Hinduism: Key Concepts and Methods|first1=Sushil|last1=Mittal|first2=Gene|last2=Thursby|date=10 September 2007|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|accessdate=25 August 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203939734}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the gods of the Rig-Veda as active forces of nature, only partly personified as imagined [[supernatural]] persons. From this claim Müller derived his theory that mythology is "a disease of language". By this he meant that myth transforms concepts into beings and stories. In Müller's view, "gods" began as words constructed to express abstract ideas, but were transformed into imagined personalities. Thus the Indo-European father-god appears under various names: [[Zeus]], [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], [[Dyaus Pita]]. For Müller all these names can be traced to the word ''"Dyaus",'' which he understood to imply "shining" or "radiance". This leads to the terms "deva", "deus", "theos" as generic terms for a god, and to the names "Zeus" and "Jupiter" (derived from deus-pater). In this way a metaphor becomes personified and ossified. This aspect of Müller's thinking was later explored similarly by [[Nietzsche]].

===Gifford Lectures===
[[File:Friedrich Max Müller, Vanity Fair, 1875-02-06.jpg|thumb|1875 [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']] caricature of Müller confirming that, at the age of fifty-one, with numerous honours, he was one of the truly notable "Men of the Day".]]
In 1888, Müller was appointed Gifford Lecturer at the [[University of Glasgow]]. These [[Gifford Lectures]] were the first in an annual series, given at several Scottish universities, that has continued to the present day. Over the next four years, Müller gave four series of lectures.&lt;ref name="gifford_bio" /&gt; The titles and order of the lectures were as follows:&lt;ref name="gifford4"&gt;Müller, F. Max (1895), ''Theosophy or Psychological Religion.'' London: Longmans, Green and Co., pp.89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Natural Religion'''. This first course of lectures was intended as purely introductory, and had for its object a definition of Natural Religion in its widest sense.
# '''Physical Religion'''. This second course of lectures was intended to show how different nations had arrived at a belief in something infinite behind the finite, in something invisible behind the visible, in many unseen agents or gods of nature, until they reached a belief in one god above all those gods. In short, a history of the discovery of the infinite in nature.
# '''Anthropological Religion'''. This third course was intended to show how different nations arrived at a belief in a [[soul]], how they named its various faculties, and what they imagined about its fate after death.
# '''Theosophy or Psychological Religion'''. The fourth and last course of lectures was intended to examine the relation between God and the soul ("these two Infinites"), including the ideas that some of the principal nations of the world have formed concerning this relation. Real religion, Müller asserted, is founded on a true perception of the ''relation'' of the soul to God and of God to the soul; Müller wanted to prove that this was true, not only as a postulate, but as an historical fact. The original title of the lectures was 'Psychological Religion' but Müller felt compelled to add 'Theosophy' to it. Müller's final Gifford Lecture is significant in interpreting his work broadly, as he situates his philological and historical research within a [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] and [[mystical]] theological project.&lt;ref name="Josephson-Storm"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences |location = Chicago| publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|108–110}}

===As translator===
In 1881, he published a translation of the first edition of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. He agreed with [[Schopenhauer]] that this edition was the most direct and honest expression of Kant's thought. His translation corrected several errors that were committed by previous translators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Athenaeum|author=J.Lection|quote=At times Prof. Muller has succeeded in correcting an error and in coming closer to his original or has modified the harshness of Mr. Meiklejohn's style; but in other passages we prefer the latter, and of certain general changes made by Prof. Max Muller.|year = 1882|page = 629}} Original from ''Priceton University''&lt;/ref&gt; In his Translator's Preface, Müller wrote 
{{quote|The bridge of thoughts and sighs that spans the whole history of the Aryan world has its first arch in the [[Rigveda|Veda]], its last in Kant's Critique.&amp;nbsp;... While in the Veda we may study the childhood, we may study in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason the perfect manhood of the Aryan mind.&amp;nbsp;... The materials are now accessible, and the English-speaking race, the race of the future, will have in Kant's Critique another [[Aryan]] heirloom, as precious as the Veda—a work that may be criticised, but can never be ignored.}}

Müller continued to be influenced by the Kantian [[Transcendental idealism|Transcendentalist]] model of spirituality,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h5XMBlBVbQsC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=Friedrich+Max+Müller+(1881).+Critique+of+Pure+Reason&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMoZCbzMjVAhUKxoMKHeMrD4UQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Friedrich%20Max%20Müller%20(1881).%20Critique%20of%20Pure%20Reason&amp;f=false ''Kant's Critique of Pure Reason''], Last Essays by the Right Hon.

Max. ''Three Lectures on the Science of Language, etc., with a Supplement, My Predecessors''. 3rd ed. Chicago, 1899, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also influenced by the work ''Thought and Reality'', of the Russian philosopher [[African Spir]]. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Views on India==
===Early career===
In his  career, Müller several times expressed the view that a "reformation" within Hinduism needed to occur, comparable to the Christian Reformation.&lt;ref name="Menant"&gt;Menant, M. D. (1907) "Influence of Max Muller's Hibbert Lectures in India," ''[[The American Journal of Theology]]'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 293–307.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, "if there is one thing which a comparative study of religions places in the clearest light, it is the inevitable decay to which every religion is exposed...&amp;nbsp;Whenever we can trace back a religion to its first beginnings, we find it free from many blemishes that affected it in its later states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Approaches to the Study of Religion: Aims, Methods, and Theories of Research, Volume 1|page = 87|author = Jacques Waardenburg|year = 1999|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110163285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He used his links with the [[Brahmo Samaj]] to encourage such a reformation on the lines pioneered by [[Ram Mohan Roy]]. Müller believed that the Brahmos would engender an Indian form of Christianity and that they were in practice "Christians, without being Roman Catholics, Anglicans or Lutherans". In the Lutheran tradition, he hoped that the "superstition" and idolatry, which he considered to be characteristic of modern popular Hinduism, would disappear.&lt;ref name = "sha"&gt;Sharada Sugirtharajah, ''Imagining hinduism: a postcolonial perspective'', Routledge, 2003, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Müller wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The translation of the ''Veda'' will hereafter tell to a great extent on the fate of India, and on the growth of millions of souls in that country. It is the root of their religion, and to show them what the root is, is, I feel sure, is the only way of uprooting all that has sprung from it during the last 3,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate|author = Edwin Bryant|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=289|year=2001|isbn=9780195137774}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Karmic Traces, 1993–1999|author=Eliot Weinberger|publisher=New Directions Publishing|year=2000|page=174|isbn=9780811214568}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Müller hoped that increased funding for education in India would promote a new form of literature combining Western and Indian traditions. In 1868 he wrote to [[George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|George Campbell]], the newly appointed [[Secretary of State for India]]:

{{quote|India has been conquered once, but India must be conquered again, and that second conquest should be a conquest by education. Much has been done for education of late, but if the funds were tripled and quadrupled, that would hardly be enough (...) By encouraging a study of their own ancient literature, as part of their education, a national feeling of pride and self-respect will be reawakened among those who influence the large masses of the people. A new national literature may spring up, impregnated with Western ideas, yet retaining its native spirit and character (...) A new national literature will bring with it a new national life, and new moral vigour. As to religion, that will take care of itself. The missionaries have done far more than they themselves seem to be aware of, nay, much of the work which is theirs they would probably disclaim. The Christianity of our nineteenth century will hardly be the Christianity of India. But the ancient religion of India is doomed—and if Christianity does not step in, whose fault will it be?

}}

===Late career===
In his sixties and seventies, Müller gave a series of lectures, which reflected a more nuanced view in favour of Hinduism and the ancient literature from India. In his "What can India teach us?" lecture at University of Cambridge, he championed ancient Sanskrit literature and India as follows:

{{quote|If I were to look over the whole world to find out the country most richly endowed with all the wealth, power, and beauty that nature can bestow—in some parts a very paradise on earth—I should point to India. If I were asked under what sky the human mind has most full developed some of its choicest gifts, has most deeply pondered on the greatest problems of life, and has found solutions of some of them which well deserve the attention even of those who have studied Plato and Kant—I should point to India. And if I were to ask myself from what literature we, here in Europe, we who have been nurtured almost exclusively on the thoughts of Greeks and Romans, and of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw that corrective which is most wanted in order to make our inner life more perfect, more comprehensive, more universal, in fact more truly human, a life, not for this life only, but a transfigured and eternal life—again I should point to India.
|sign=Max Müller|source=(1883)&lt;ref&gt;Max Müller, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20847/20847-h/20847-h.htm#LECTURE_I INDIA – LECTURE I. WHAT CAN INDIA TEACH US?], A Course of Lectures Delivered before the University of Cambridge, Project Gutenberg&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

He also conjectured that the introduction of Islam in India in the 11th century had a deep effect on the psyche and behaviour of Hindus in another lecture, "Truthful Character of the Hindus":

{{quote|The other epic poem too, the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', is full of episodes showing a profound regard for truth. (...) Were I to quote from all the law-books, and from still later works, everywhere you would hear the same key-note of truthfulness vibrating through them all. (...) I say once more that I do not wish to represent the people of India as two hundred and fifty-three millions of angels, but I do wish it to be understood and to be accepted as a fact, that the damaging charge of untruthfulness brought against that people is utterly unfounded with regard to ancient times. It is not only not true, but the very opposite of the truth. As to modern times, and I date them from about 1000 after Christ (AD), I can only say that, after reading the accounts of the terrors and horrors of Mohammedan rule, my wonder is that so much of native virtue and truthfulness should have survived. You might as well expect a mouse to speak the truth before a cat, as a Hindu before a Mohammedan judge.

[[Swami Vivekananda]], who was the foremost disciple of [[Ramakrishna Paramahamsa]], met Müller over a lunch on 28 May 1896. Regarding Müller and his wife, the Swami later wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nikhilananda |first=Swami |year=1953 |title=Vivekananda: A Biography |p=106 |url=http://www.vivekananda.net/PDFBooks/BiographybyNikhilananda.pdf |publisher=Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Center |location=New York |isbn=978-0-911206-25-8 |accessdate=19 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125032814/http://www.vivekananda.net/PDFBooks/BiographybyNikhilananda.pdf |archivedate=25 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The visit was really a revelation to me. That little white house, its setting in a beautiful garden, the silver-haired sage, with a face calm and benign, and forehead smooth as a child's in spite of seventy winters, and every line in that face speaking of a deep-seated mine of spirituality somewhere behind; that noble wife, the helpmate of his life through his long and arduous task of exciting interest, overriding opposition and contempt, and at last creating a respect for the thoughts of the sages of ancient India—the trees, the flowers, the calmness, and the clear sky—all these sent me back in imagination to the glorious days of ancient India, the days of our brahmarshis and rajarshis, the days of the great vanaprasthas, the days of Arundhatis and Vasishthas. It was neither the philologist nor the scholar that I saw, but a soul that is every day realizing its oneness with the universe.}}

==Controversies==

===Anti-Christian===
During the course of his [[Gifford Lectures]] on the subject of "natural religion", Müller was severely criticised for being anti-Christian. In 1891, at a meeting of the Established [[Presbytery of Glasgow]], Mr. Thomson (Minister of Ladywell) moved a motion that Müller's teaching was "subversive of the Christian faith, and fitted to spread [[pantheistic]] and infidel views amongst the students and others" and questioned Müller's appointment as lecturer.&lt;ref&gt;Müller (1902) ''The Life and Letters'', p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; An even stronger attack on Müller was made by Monsignor Alexander Munro in [[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Glasgow|St Andrew's Cathedral]]. Munro, an officer of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland (and Provost of the Catholic Cathedral of Glasgow from 1884 to 1892), declared that Müller's lectures "were nothing less than a crusade against Divine [[revelation]], against Jesus Christ, and against Christianity". The blasphemous lectures were, he continued, "the proclamation of atheism under the guise of pantheism" and "uprooted our idea of God, for it repudiated the idea of a personal God".&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Georgina (1902) ''The Life and Letters of Right Honorable Friedrich Max Müller''. Vol 2. London: Longman, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar accusations had already led to Müller's exclusion from the Boden chair in Sanskrit in favour of the conservative [[Monier Monier-Williams]]. By the 1880s Müller was being courted by [[Charles Godfrey Leland]], medium and [[Scottish Rite Freemasonry|Freemason]] [[Helena Blavatsky]], and other writers who were seeking to assert the merits of "[[Paganism|pagan]]" religious traditions over Christianity. The designer [[Mary Fraser Tytler]] stated that Müller's book ''Chips from a German Workshop'' (a collection of his essays) was her "Bible", which helped her to create a multi-cultural sacred imagery.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Müller distanced himself from these developments, and remained within the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] faith in which he had been brought up. According to G. Beckerlegge, "Müller's background as a Lutheran German and his identification with the Broad Church party" led to "suspicion by those opposed to the political and religious positions that they felt Müller represented", particularly his [[latitudinarianism]].&lt;ref name="Beckerlegge"&gt;Beckerlegge, G. (1997) "Professor Friedrich Max Müller and the Missionary Cause". In, John Wolffe (Ed) ''Religion in Victorian Britain V Culture and Empire''. Manchester University Press, p.189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Müller took a strong religious and academic interest in [[Hinduism]] and other non-Christian religions, and often compared Christianity to religions that many traditional Protestants would have regarded as primitive or false, he grounded his [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]] in a belief that Christianity possessed the fullest truth of all living religions.&lt;ref name="Josephson-Storm" /&gt;{{rp|109–10}} Twenty-first century scholars of religion, far from accusing Müller of being anti-Christian, have critically examined Müller's theological project as evidence for a bias towards Christian conceptions of God in early academic [[religious studies]].&lt;ref name="Josephson-Storm" /&gt;{{rp|120–2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Manufacturing Religion: The Discourse on Sui Generis Religion and the Politics of Nostalgia |last=McCutcheon | first=Russell T. |location = New York | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 1997 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NKtPBsVd0d8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages = 58–61|isbn= 978-0195355680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Darwin disagreement===
Müller attempted to formulate a philosophy of religion that addressed the crisis of faith engendered by the historical and critical study of religion by German scholars on the one hand, and by the [[Darwinism|Darwinian revolution]] on the other. He was wary of Darwin's work on human evolution, and attacked his view of the development of human faculties. His work was taken up by cultural commentators such as his friend [[John Ruskin]], who saw it as a productive response to the crisis of the age (compare [[Matthew Arnold]]'s "[[Dover Beach]]"). He analysed mythologies as rationalisations of natural phenomena, primitive beginnings that we might denominate "[[protoscience]]" within a cultural evolution.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Müller also proposed an early, mystical interpretation of [[theistic evolution]], using Darwinism as a critique of [[mechanical philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Josephson-Storm" /&gt;{{rp|113}}

In 1870 Müller gave a short course of three lectures for the British Institution on language as the barrier between man and beast, which he called "On Darwin's Philosophy of Language". Müller specifically disagreed with Darwin's theories on the origin of language and that the language of man could have developed from the language of animals. In 1873, he sent a copy of his lectures to Darwin reassuring him that, though he differed from some of Darwin's conclusions, he was one of his "diligent readers and sincere admirers".&lt;ref&gt;"More Letters of Charles Darwin&amp;nbsp;– Volume 2" Page 397&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aryanism===
Müller's work contributed to the developing interest in [[Aryan]] culture, which often set Indo-European ("Aryan") traditions in opposition to [[Abrahamic religions|Semitic]] religions. He was "deeply saddened by the fact that these classifications later came to be expressed in [[racism|racist]] terms", as this was far from his intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Mapping channels between Ganges and Rhein: German-Indian cross-cultural relations|quote=In later years, especially before his death, he was deeply saddened by the fact that these classifications later came to be expressed in racist terms.|author1=Jorg Esleben |author2=Jörg Esleben |author3=Christina Kraenzle |author4=Sukanya Kulkarni |publisher=Cambridge Scholars publication|year=2008|isbn=9781847185877}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2018}}{{Failed verification|reason=Book absent|date=October 2018}} For Müller the discovery of common Indian and European ancestry was a powerful argument against racism, arguing that "an ethnologist who speaks of Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar" and that "the blackest Hindus represent an earlier stage of Aryan speech and thought than the fairest Scandinavians".&lt;ref&gt;F. Max Müller, ''Biographies of Words and the Home of the Aryas'' (1888), Kessinger Publishing reprint, 2004, p.120; Dorothy Matilda Figueira, ''Aryans, Jews, Brahmins: Theorizing Authority Through Myths of Identity'', SUNY Press, 2002, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2018}}

===Turanian===
Müller put forward and promoted the theory of a "[[Turanian languages|Turanian]]" family of languages or speech, comprising the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]], [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]], "Tataric" ([[Turkic languages|Turkic]]), [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]], and [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, M. (1854) ''The last results of the researches respecting the non-Iranian and non-Semitic languages of Asia or Europe, or the Turanian family of language. (Letter of Professor Max Muller to Chevalier Bunsen; Oxford August 1853; on the classification of the Turanian languages). In, Christian Bunsen (1854) ''Outlines of the Philosophy of Universal History, Applied to Language and Religion.'' In Two Volumes. Vol. 1. London: Brown, Green, and Longmans.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller, M. (1855) ''The Languages of the Seat of War in the East. With a Survey of the Three Families of language, Semitic, Arian, and Turanian''. London: [[Williams and Norgate]]. 2nd edition&lt;/ref&gt; According to Müller these five languages were those "spoken in Asia or Europe not included under the Arian (sic) and Semitic families, with the exception perhaps of the Chinese and its dialects". In addition, they were "nomadic languages," in contrast to the other two families (Aryan and Semitic), which he called State or political languages.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, M. (1855) ''The languages of the seat of war in the East. With a survey of the three families of language, Semitic, Arian, and Turanian''. London: Williams and Norgate, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a Turanian family of languages was not accepted by everyone at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Origins of Himalayan Studies: Brian Houghton Hodgson in Nepal and Darjeeling|page = 20/232 |author = David Waterhouse|year=2002|quote = In 1910, a full decade after Muller's death, the ''Turan Tarsasag'' 'Turanian Society' was founded in order to study the history and culture of the Hungarians and other 'Turanian' peoples.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "Turanian" quickly became an archaism&lt;ref&gt;Masuza, T. (2005) ''The Invention of World Religions, Or, How European Universalism was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism''. The University of Chicago Press, p.229.&lt;/ref&gt; (unlike "Aryan"), it did not disappear completely. The idea was absorbed later into nationalist ideologies in [[Hungarian Turanism|Hungary]] and [[Turanism#Turkey|Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Günay Göksu Özdoğan: ''The case of racism-Turanism: Turkism during single-party period, 1931–1944: a radical variant of Turkish nationalism''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
[[File:Friedrich Max Müller, 1898.jpg|right|thumb|Müller c. 1898, wearing his ''[[:fr:Habit vert|Habit vert]]'' costume with the insignia of the order [[Pour le Mérite]] and the [[Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art]]]]
In 1869 Müller was elected to the French ''[[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]]'' as a foreign correspondent (''associé étranger'').&lt;ref name="belles-lettres" /&gt;

In June 1874 Müller was awarded the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'' (civil class), much to his surprise. Soon after, when he was commanded to dine at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]], he wrote to [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany|Prince Leopold]] to ask if he ''might'' wear his Order, and the wire came back, "Not ''may'', but ''must''."&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Georgina (1902). ''The Life and Letters of Right Honorable Friedrich Max Müller''. Vol 1. London: Longman, p. 462&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875 Müller was awarded the [[Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art]]. The award is given to acknowledge excellent and outstanding achievements in the field of science and art. In a letter to his mother dated 19 December, Müller wrote that the award was more showy than the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'', "but that is the best".&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Georgina (1902) ''The Life and Letters of Right Honorable Friedrich Max Müller''. Vol 1. London: Longman, p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896 Müller was appointed a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=26754 |date=30 June 1896 |page=3767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Müller became a naturalized British citizen in 1855, at the age of 32.

He married Georgina Adelaide Grenfell on 3 August 1859. The couple had four children – Ada, Mary, Beatrice and [[Wilhelm Max Müller|Wilhelm Max]] – of whom two predeceased them.&lt;ref name="ODNB2007" /&gt;

Georgina (died 1919) had his papers and correspondence bound; they are at the [[Bodleian Library]], Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/1500-1900/muller/maxmuller.html|title=Max Muller Papers|publisher=|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Müller's health began deteriorating in 1898 and he died at his home in Oxford on 28 October 1900. He was interred at [[Holywell Cemetery]] on 1 November 1900.&lt;ref name="gifford_bio" /&gt;

After his death a memorial fund was opened at Oxford for "the promotion of learning and research in all matters relating to the history and archaeology, the languages, literatures, and religions of ancient India".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orinst.ox.ac.uk/general/trust_funds/max_muller_memorial_fund.html ''Max Müller Memorial Fund''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103023849/http://www.orinst.ox.ac.uk/general/trust_funds/max_muller_memorial_fund.html |date=3 January 2011 }}. [[Faculty of Oriental Studies, University of Oxford]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Goethe Institute]]s in India are named [[Max Müller Bhavan]] in his honour, as is a street (Max Mueller Marg) in [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/ins/in/lp/uun/mxm/enindex.htm About Max Mueller]. Goethe-Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Müller's biographies include those by Lourens van den Bosch (2002), Jon R. Stone (2002) and [[Nirad C. Chaudhuri]] (1974), the last of which was awarded the [[List of Sahitya Akademi Award winners for English|Sahitya Akademi Award for English]] by [[Sahitya Akademi]], India's National Academy of Letters. [[Stephen G. Alter]]'s (2005) work contains a chapter on Müller's rivalry with the American linguist [[William Dwight Whitney]].

'''Michael Maier'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Post-nominal letters]] placed after his name included "[[Examen philosophicum|Eq. Ex. Phil.]] &amp; [[Medical doctorate|Med. D.]]"&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-la|Michael Maierus}}; 1568–1622) was a German physician and counsellor to [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II Habsburg]].  He was a learned [[Alchemy|alchemist]], epigramist and amateur composer.&lt;ref name=Martels&gt;{{cite book|first1=Karin|last1=Figala|first2=Ulrich |last2=Neumann| chapter=Michael Maier (1569-1622): New Bio-Bibliographical Material| editor-last=Martels|editor-first=Z.R.W.M. von|title=Alchemy revisited : proceedings of the International conference on the history of alchemy at the University of Groningen, 17-19 April 1989|year=1990|publisher=E.J. Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9004092870|pages=34–50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r8sUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA34|edition=1ª }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Maier was born in [[Rendsburg]], [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]], the son of a specialist in beadwork in embroidery named Peter Maier.&lt;ref name="Martels" /&gt; He studied philosophy and medicine at [[Rostock]] (1587–1591), [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] (M.A. 1592), and [[Padua]] (1595–1596).&lt;ref name="Martels" /&gt; Maier left Padua abruptly after getting involved in a fight, injuring the other party, and being arrested.&lt;ref name="Martels" /&gt;  He went on to the [[University of Basel]], where he attained a doctorate in medicine in October 1596. His doctoral thesis, ''De epilepsia'' was dedicated to Matthias Carnarius.&lt;ref name="Martels" /&gt; Maier then returned to Holstein to practice medicine. Around 1599, he became interested in [[alchemy]] and attempted to create an alchemical concordance, synthesizing the works of different authors.&lt;ref name="Martels" /&gt;

==In the service of Rudolf II (1609-1611)==
In 1608, he went to [[Prague]], and on 19 September 1609, he formally entered the service of [[Rudolf II]] as his physician and imperial counsellor. Ten days later, Rudolf raised him to the hereditary nobility and gave him the title of [[Imperial Count Palatine]].&lt;ref name="Martels" /&gt; He was granted a coat of arms which depicted a bird, bonded together with frog by a golden chain. Around this time, Maier published an extremely limited print run of ''De Medicina Regia et vere Heroica, Coelidonia'' (1609), including in it his autobiography. The interest of the emperor in the occult was the reason of his high esteem for Maier. However, by April 1611, Rudolf's political position had substantially deteriorated, and he was more or less imprisoned in his castle in Prague&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rudolf II, Holy Roman emperor|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rudolf-II-Holy-Roman-emperor|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=21 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maier left the city that month. He corresponded with [[Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Moritz of Hessen-Kassel]], and visited Hessen-Kassel's brother-in-law, [[Ernst of Schaumburg|Count Ernst III of Holstein-Schauenburg]]. He was also a guest of Christoph Reinhard, Doctor of Laws and town syndic of [[Mühlhausen]], to whom he later dedicated his book ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]''.&lt;ref name="Martels" /&gt;

==In England 1611-1616==
First Maier visited the [[Netherlands]] where he stayed with [[Petrus Carpenterius]] in [[Rotterdam]]. Carpernterius had previously been the rector of a Walloon school in [[Norwich]] in 1598.&lt;ref name="MM&amp;E"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heisler|first1=Ron 43 (1989): 119.|title=Michael Maier and England|journal=The Hermetic Journal|date=1989|issue=43|pages=119–126}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there he continued on to London arriving in 1611 or 1612. Whether he had arrived in person or not by Christmas 1611 is unknown, but he did send [[Christmas card]]s to both [[James I of England|James I]] and his son [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]].

He composed a wedding song for the nuptials of [[Frederick V of the Palatinate]] to [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Elizabeth Stuart]] daughter of [[James I of England|James I]]. He was in London on 6 November 1612, attending the Funeral of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]] in the retinue of Frederick of the Palatinate.

His first well-known book, ''Arcana arcanissima'', was published in London in 1613 or 1614, and he dedicated copies to a number of notables, including the [[Lancelot Andrewes|Bishop of Ely]] and [[Thomas Smythe (died 1625)|Sir Thomas Smith]] of the East India Company.&lt;ref name="Martels" /&gt;

[[File:Michael Maier Atalanta Fugiens Emblem 08.jpeg|thumb|Image taken from the hermetic splendid book ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]'' by Michael Maier.]]
Maier returned to Germany in September 1616, settling in [[Frankfurt am Main]].&lt;ref name="Martels" /&gt; His ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]'', an alchemical [[emblem book]], was published in 1617. Alongside images, poems, and discussion, it included fifty pieces of music in the form of [[fugues]], the form itself being a pun on [[Atalanta]] "fleeing". In 1619, Maier became the physician of [[Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Landgrave Moritz of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel)]]. In 1620, he moved to [[Magdeburg]] to practice medicine, where he died at the age of 54, leaving a noteworthy quantity of unpublished works.

A devout [[Lutheran]] all his life, Michael Maier had a strong influence on Sir [[Isaac Newton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jo Teeter Dobbs|first1=Betty|title=The Foundations of Newton's Alchemy|date=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=90, 192}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved in the [[Rosicrucian]] movement that appeared around this time, which afforded part of the matter of his ''Themis aurea''.&lt;ref&gt;Hereward Tilton, ''The Quest for the Phoenix: Spiritual Alchemy and Rosicrucianism in the Work of Count Michael Maier (1569–1622)'' (de Gruyter) 2003:30ff "Spiritual alchemy, Rosicrucianism and the work of Count Michael Maier".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The 1656 English translation of Themis Aurea appeared as ''Themis Aurea: The Laws of the Fraternity of the Rosie Cross'', and was dedicated to [[Elias Ashmole]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Brown Craven]], ''Count Michael Maier - Life and Writings'' Kirkwall, 1910 reprinted by photolithography Unwin Brothers 1968 SBN 7129 0335 6 pg 98&lt;/ref&gt; Under the initials N.L.T.S. and H.S. the dedicators justified their dedication over three pages; they are now identified as [[Nathaniel Hodges]], and Thomas Hodges (either his father or his brother, both of that name).&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=66142|title=Hodges, Nathaniel|first=Helen|last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashmole, they said, began to learn seal engraving, casting in sand, and goldsmith's work when living in Blackfriars, London, at which time he was initiated into rosicrucian "secrets" by [[William Backhouse]] of Swallowfield in Berkshire.&lt;ref&gt;Craven, 1910 pg 99&lt;/ref&gt; While illustrating the chain of Rosie Cross links from Michael Maier and [[Robert Fludd]], via Backhouse to Ashmole, the details given about Ashmole's training as a craftsman could illustrate the background of the latter's acception in operative masonry.

[[James Brown Craven]], who gave detailed descriptions of the works above in his ''catalogue raissonée'' (1910) of Michael Maier, also included the 1654 English translation of ''Lusus Serius: or, Serious Passtime. A Philosophical Discourse ...wherein Hermes or Mercury is declared King of all Worldly things''. The copy from the Bodleian Library described by Craven&lt;ref&gt;Craven, 1910 pg 53&lt;/ref&gt; was dedicated "To the Honourable Cary Dillon, Esq., Son to Robert, late Earle of Roscommon by J. de la Salle" [i.e., [[John Hall of Durham]]]. This is a fair example of the intellectual circle in which Maier's work circulated contemporary with the association of Rosie Cross with Elias Ashmole.

'''Monoculturalism''' is the policy or process of supporting, advocating, or allowing the expression of the culture of a single social or ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/monoculturalism Monoculturalism], online Oxford dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; It generally stems from beliefs within the dominant group that their cultural practices are superior to those of minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Y. Encyclopedia of Multicultural Psychology, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it may also involve the process of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] whereby other ethnic groups are expected to adopt the culture and practices of the dominant ethnic group. Monoculturalism, in the context of [[cultural diversity]], is the opposite of [[multiculturalism]].
 
Rather than the suppression of different ethnic groups within a given society, sometimes monoculturalism manifests as the active preservation of a country's national culture via the exclusion of external influences. [[Japan]], [[China]], [[South Korea]], and [[North Korea]] are examples of this form of monoculturalism. However it may also be the result of less intentional factors such as geographic isolation, historical racial homogeneity, or political isolation. For instance, some European countries such as [[Finland]] are still effectively monocultural because of the people's shared culture and ethnicity.{{Citation needed|reason=There's no citation marked for this claim.|date=October 2017}}

== Ethnocentric monoculturalism ==
The idea of monoculturalism can be expanded to that of [[ethnocentrism]]. Ethnocentrism being the idea that one's ethnic background is superior to that of others. A feeling of superiority is one that can project mono-cultural ideals in an attempt to justify intrinsic ways of thinking. In nations with a majority of the population being native, ethnocentrism is blindly put upon those of other cultural backings. The idea of ethnocentrism being combined with monoculturalism yields many examples from history. Most obvious is the Holocaust, but further from that is any instance of genocide or simple racism. In defining genocide you can find the correlation it has with monoculturalism, and how it can be a resultant of mono-cultural, as well as, ethnocentric thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sue|first=Derald Wing|title=Whiteness and Ethnocentric Monoculturalism: Making the "Invisible" Visible|journal=American Psychologist|volume=November 2004|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.59.8.761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Instances ==

=== In genocide ===

In many of the [[genocide]]s practiced throughout history, some of them were based on ethnic supremacy. Ethnic supremacy is assumed by one group within a culture, following some distinct action by an external group or from one of the ethnic groups. With European intervention in places like Rwanda, social institutions worked to socially construct an ethnic inferiority, distinguishing the Hutu's and Tutsi's from one another and causing what would be one of the most horrific demonstrations of genocide in modern history.&lt;ref&gt;White, Kenneth R. "Scourge of Racism: Genocide in Rwanda". ''Journal of Black Studies''. Vol. 39, No. 3 (Jan., 2009), pp. 471-472.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar example to that of the Rwandan Genocide was the ongoing civil war in Burma. The civil war spanned from a constitution that granted Burma their independence from England, in which a group of leaders created conditions that didn't involve many of Burma's Ethnic Minorities, and instigated a fight from them.&lt;ref&gt;"Tracking Genocide: Persecution of the Karen in Burma". ''Texas international law journal''. Volume: 48 Issue: 1 Page: 63 10/01/2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these ethnic minorities in Burma, including the [[Karen people|Karen]], have been significantly displaced by the military junta and placed into refugee camps in bordering nations. The remaining ethnic minorities have been living in poor conditions, and have been met by a variety of human rights abuses.

=== Globalization ===
[[Globalization]] involves the free movement of goods, capital, services, people, technology and information throughout the world. It also involves the international integration of potentially very different countries through the adoption of the same or similar [[world view]]s, ideologies, and other aspects of culture. Marsella argues that this is monoculturalism on a grand scale.&lt;ref&gt;Marsella, Anthony (2005). [http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/MarsellaHegemonicGlobalizationAustralianMosaic.pdf ""Hegemonic" Globalization and Cultural Diversity: The Risks of Global Monoculturalism"] (PDF). ''Australian Mosaic''. Issue 11 Number 13: 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Potentially it could lead to the suppression and loss of different ethnic cultures on a global scale.

[[File:The How and Why Library 001.jpg|thumb|250px|Frontispiece to ''[[s:The How and Why Library|The How and Why Library]]'', 1909]]

'''"Once upon a time"''' is a [[stock phrase]] used to introduce a narrative of past events, typically in [[fairy tale]]s and folk tales. It has been used in some form since at least 1380 (according to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'') in [[storytelling]] in the [[English language]] and has opened many oral narratives since 1600. These stories often then end with "and they all lived [[happy ending|happily ever after]]", or, originally, "happily until their deaths".

The phrase is particularly common in [[fairy tale]]s for younger children, where it is almost always the [[opening sentence|opening line]] of a tale. It was commonly used in the original translations of the stories of [[Charles Perrault]] as a translation for the [[French language|French]] "{{lang|fr|il était une fois}}", of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] as a translation for the [[Danish language|Danish]] "{{lang|da|der var engang}}", (literally "there was once"), the [[Brothers Grimm]] as a translation for the [[German language|German]] "{{lang|de|es war einmal}}" (literally "it was once") and [[Joseph Jacobs]] in [[English language|English]] translations and fairy tales.

The phrase is also frequently used in such oral stories as retellings of [[mythology|myths]], [[fable]]s, [[folklore]] and children's literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/literally-psyched/2012/05/08/the-power-of-once-upon-a-time-a-story-to-tame-the-wild-things/ blogs.scientificamerican.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other languages==
The "story-starting phrase" is a common feature of many languages.

The '''''Oregon Blue Book''''' is the official directory and fact book for the U.S. state of [[Oregon]] prepared by the [[Oregon Secretary of State]]&lt;ref name="ORS"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors177.html|title = ORS 177.120|publisher = [[Oregon Legislative Counsel]]|accessdate = February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published by the Office of the Secretary's [[Oregon State Archives|Archives Division]].

The ''Blue Book'' comes in both print and online editions. The [[Oregon Revised Statutes]] require the Secretary of State to publish the print edition "biennially on or about February 15 of the same year as the regular sessions of the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]],"&lt;ref name=ORS/&gt; which are during odd-numbered years; it has been so published since 1911.  The online edition is updated regularly.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web |url= https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/about.aspx |title= About the Oregon Blue Book |publisher= Oregon Secretary of State |accessdate= February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The book contains information on the state, city, county, and federal governments in Oregon, educational institutions, finances, the economy, resources, population figures and demographics.&lt;ref name=ERG83&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19830410&amp;id=jP5VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UeIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3537,2331038 |title= New Oregon Blue Book Published |author= [[United Press International]] |date= April 10, 1983 |newspaper= [[The Register-Guard]] |accessdate= February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1919 edition contained a "statement of registered motor vehicles, chauffeurs, and dealers from 1905 to 1919", and "a general summary of in the taxable property in Oregon from 1858 to 1918".&lt;ref name=Received&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19190911&amp;id=0NgsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HCAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3731,5589153 |date= September 11, 1919 |title= Blue Book is Received Here |newspaper= [[The Bulletin (Bend)|The Bulletin]] |accessdate= February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Secretary of State [[Ben Olcott]] published the first edition in 1911 in response to an "increased demand for information of a general character concerning Oregon".&lt;ref name=Indispensable&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19950525&amp;id=4ERWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7OoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3777,5960904 |title= Blue Book Indispensable |newspaper= The Register-Guard |date= May 25, 1995 |accessdate= February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early editions of the book were available free from the State.&lt;ref name=Received/&gt; By 1937, copies cost 25; in 1981 the book cost $4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19370921&amp;id=dMpYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Q-gDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2452,1169200 |title= Oregon Blue Book Being Distributed |author= United Press International |date= September 21, 1937 |newspaper= The Register-Guard |accessdate= February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19810427&amp;id=tl0zAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EPcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3755,5317981 |title= Oregon Blue Book Makes Biennial Appearance |author= United Press International |date= April 27, 1981 |newspaper= The Bulletin |accessdate= February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, a legislative ways and means subcommittee, headed by Representative [[Francis Ziegler]], was going to confer with Secretary of State [[Earl T. Newbry]] about how to improve the ''Blue Book''.&lt;ref name=Revision&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19530323&amp;id=URZWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=veIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5600,1181962 |title= Legislative Group to Study Revision of 'Blue Book' |date= March 23, 1953 |newspaper= The Register-Guard |author= United Press International |accessdate= February 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was following complaints by Representative [[Monroe Sweetland]] that the book was "obsolete, carelessly edited, and only of limited use."&lt;ref name=Revision/&gt; Calling the book "an inferior job", Sweetland criticized the timing of book's publication long after elections, as well as the map in the back.&lt;ref name=Revision/&gt; As a result, the [[47th Oregon Legislative Assembly|1953 Legislative Assembly]] passed a law requiring the book be published soon after the legislature convenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19550125&amp;id=nPlVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=p-IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6704,3150227 |title= Oregon Blue Book Printed But It Isn't Blue Any More |author= [[Associated Press]] |date= January 25, 1955 |newspaper= The Register-Guard |accessdate= February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1993–94 edition of the book contained a four-page [[erratum]].&lt;ref name=Indispensable/&gt; When [[Norma Paulus]] was Secretary of State, she would send a free copy of the book to the first person to find a mistake in each new edition.&lt;ref name=Indispensable/&gt; The 1995–96 edition was reduced in size from its predecessors.&lt;ref name=Indispensable/&gt;

==Reviews==
A 1995 ''[[Register-Guard]]'' editorial called the book "indispensable".&lt;ref name=Indispensable/&gt;

'''''Playfair Cricket Annual''''' is a compact [[annual publication|annual]] about [[cricket]] that is published in the [[United Kingdom]] each April, just before the English cricket season is due to begin. It has been published every year since 1948. Its main purposes are to review the previous English season and to provide detailed career records and potted biographies of current players.  It is produced in a "pocket-sized" format, being approximately 5×4 in (i.e., about 13×10&amp;nbsp;cm), so that it is a convenient size for carrying to cricket matches. The front cover of each edition has featured a photograph of a prominent current cricketer. There is a popular myth that this "honour" has a "hex"&lt;ref&gt;''Playfair Cricket Annual'' 2000, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; or "curse"&lt;ref&gt;''Playfair Cricket Annual'' 2005, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; associated with it, as the player featured then invariably has a poor season.

==Publications==
The original publisher was Playfair Books Ltd of London, which had its office at Curzon Street when the first edition was published in April 1948; the company relocated soon afterwards to Haymarket. The name Playfair was chosen because it reads as "play fair", as confirmed by [[C B Fry]] who began his foreword to the first edition in 1948: "This Playfair Annual (and what a proper title for a book about the Noble Game) will commend itself to innumerable readers".&lt;ref&gt;''Playfair Books Cricket Annual'' 1948, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The first editor was [[Peter West]] who was succeeded in 1954 by [[Gordon Ross (writer)|Gordon Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;''Playfair Cricket Annual'' 1954&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Webber]] was the statistician at Playfair for many years and was described by West as "that ace of statisticians".&lt;ref&gt;''Playfair Cricket Annual'' 1952, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Playfair Cricket Annual'' is one of a series of similar pocket sized sporting annuals published under the Playfair name. Others have included ''[[Playfair Football Annual]]'', ''Playfair Rugby League Annual'' and ''Playfair Racing Annual''. In addition the Playfair name was used for record books produced by Roy Webber and for the magazine [[Playfair Cricket Monthly]]. A number of tour brochures were also produced by Playfair Books.

Between 1948 and 1962 the annual was a larger size, 4¾×7¼ in (12×18&amp;nbsp;cm) and had a different style, being printed on glossy paper and including numerous photographs. In 1962 the Playfair titles were acquired by Dickens Press which had just published ''[[The Cricket Annual]]'', edited by Roy Webber.  In 1963, Dickens published a new style ''Playfair Cricket Annual'', keeping the same name but basing the size, format and price on ''[[The Cricket Annual]]''. Therefore, the 2013 edition is the 66th in total, but the annual has been published in its current compact size only since the 1963 edition (the 16th).&lt;ref&gt;''Playfair Cricket Annual'' 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, ''Playfair Cricket World Cup Guide'', in 1996, and ''Playfair Cricket World Cup 1999'' were published in the same format as the regular annual to cover the International limited overs competitions in India/Pakistan/Sri Lanka and England/Scotland/Ireland/Netherlands in those years respectively. Both of those were also edited by [[Bill Frindall]].

The current publisher is Headline Publishing Group with [[Ian Marshall (cricket writer)|Ian Marshall]], who succeeded [[Bill Frindall]] on an acting basis in 2009 and permanently for the 2010 edition, as editor.  There are several specialist contributors, notably [[Philip Bailey (cricket writer)|Philip Bailey]] who compiles the career records.&lt;ref&gt;''Playfair Cricket Annual'' 2008, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tables provide a summary of each annual by reference to editor, size and price:

In each of the first 15 editions there was a 16-page photographic section in addition to the numbered pages.  The 1948 annual was actually called ''Playfair Books Cricket Annual'' but subsequent years were simply called ''Playfair Cricket Annual''. There were two issues of the 1948 annual with a difference in the back cover. One had a Playfair logo, the other a Schweppes advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;''Playfair Books Cricket Annual'' 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

*Bill Frindall died soon before the 2009 annual was completed, but received sole credit as editor on the front cover. The acknowledgements page credits Ian Marshall as "acting editor". Frindall's traditional preface was written by [[Jonathan Agnew]].

From the 1998 edition onwards a thumbnail picture also appeared on the spine of the annual.  This has been a smaller version of the front cover photograph except in 1998 and 2008, when it was the back cover picture, and in 2006 and 2010 when the Ashes urn was depicted.

==County register, averages, and records==
Since the first compact edition of 1963, the core of the publication has been a section providing a county by county list of current cricketers with potted biographies, their county averages in the previous season together with some introductory notes on the county and the major county records.

The county clubs are listed in alphabetical order.  Until 1962, the biographies occupied less space and were not sorted by county club.  Introductory information about each county club has expanded, largely because of the introduction of [[limited overs cricket]] competitions. A much longer list of officials is now given; originally only the secretary and captain were given.  Until 1972 most editions gave potted scores for each club's home matches but lack of space caused this to be removed.

==Current contents==
Currently, the annual's contents typically include:&lt;ref&gt;''Playfair Cricket Annual'' 2010, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of matches==
As one of the leading statistical cricket publications, Playfair has to take a view on the status of [[Test cricket|Test]], [[One Day International]], [[first-class cricket|first-class]] and domestic [[one-day cricket|one-day]] (i.e. [[List A]]) matches.  It generally complies with the statistics published by [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] and will sometimes ignore official rulings: e.g., the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] ruling that [[South African rebel tours]] between 1981&amp;ndash;82 and 1989&amp;ndash;90 were not first-class matches. The 2010 edition overturned Frindall's long-held view that the match between Australia and an ICC World XI in 2005/06 should not be regarded as a Test Match and now includes it in its Test record section.&lt;ref&gt;''Playfair Cricket Annual'' 2010, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Property and Freedom Society''' ('''PFS''') is an [[Austrian School|Austro]]-[[Libertarianism|libertarian]] organization devoted to the promotion of [[Private property|property rights]], [[free trade]], anti-[[empiricism]] with regard to economics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stephankinsella.com/2011/06/hoppe-on-falsificationism-empiricism-and-apriorism-and-protophysics/ "Hoppe on Falsificationism, empiricism and apriorism"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The difference between the Right and the Left, as Paul Gottfried has often noted, is a fundamental disagreement concerning an empirical question. The Right recognizes, as a matter of fact, the existence of individual human differences and diversities and accepts them as natural, whereas the Left denies the existence of such differences and diversities or tries to explain them away and in any case regards them as something unnatural that must be rectified to establish a natural state of human equality." [https://www.lewrockwell.com/2014/09/hans-hermann-hoppe/smack-down/ "Hoppe on political Left and Right"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antimilitarism|anti-militarism]], [[anti-egalitarianism]], [[Freedom of association#Libertarian|freedom of association]] and [[cultural conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://propertyandfreedom.org/about/ "History and Principles."] ''Property and Freedom Society''&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in May 2006 under the [[stewardship]] of [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]], a [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbardian]] [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] political theorist and former [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] Business School professor, PFS presents itself as a more radically [[right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] alternative to the free-market [[Mont Pelerin Society]]. The PFS holds annual conferences where [[paleolibertarianism|paleolibertarian]] and [[paleoconservatism|paleoconservative]] intellectuals deliver speeches and exchange ideas in what Hoppe suggests is a "[[Political correctness|political-correctness]]-free zone".

== Mission==

On the fifth anniversary of PFS, Hoppe reflected on its goals:&lt;blockquote&gt; 
On the one hand, positively, it was to explain and elucidate the legal, economic, cognitive and cultural requirements and features of a free, state-less natural order.
On the other hand, negatively, it was to unmask the State and showcase it for what it really is: an institution run by gangs of murderers, plunderers, and thieves, surrounded by willing executioners, propagandists, sycophants, crooks, liars, clowns, charlatans, dupes and useful idiots&amp;nbsp;– an institution that dirties and taints everything it touches.&lt;ref name="4H PFS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoppe|first=Hans Hermann|title=The Property And Freedom Society&amp;nbsp;– Reflections After Five Years|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/hans-hermann-hoppe/my-life-on-the-right/|publisher=lewrockwell.com|accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Annual conferences ==

Conferences have been held annually since 2006, in [[Bodrum]], Turkey. The tenth conference was held in September 2015. Since 2013 they have been held in September. 

The PFS annual meeting explicitly aims to promote discrimination as logical choice, affirming individual responsibility - attracting growing support from intellectuals and entrepreneurs from around the globe due to their purported realisation that there is no practical difference between discrimination and choice. In addition to the formal proceedings of the conferences, there are integrated activities such as a boat trip into the [[Aegean Sea]], excursions to local fishing villages, and firework displays followed by gala nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Backbencher |title=The Club Med of Libertarian Conferences |url=http://thebackbencher.co.uk/the-property-and-freedom-society-the-club-med-of-libertarian-conferences/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The evolution of the nature of the conferences was described in a talk on the History of the Property and Freedom Society in 2015 at the 10th Anniversary Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Property and Freedom Society |title=Sean Gabb 10 Years of PFS |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL9KoXzvUug}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eighth Annual Meeting of PFS was held in  from September 19–24, 2013. Topics on the agenda included "The Myth of American Exceptionalism," "World War Two Revisited," and "Why are the Jews So Smart?," as well as a presentation on the history of race relations in the United States delivered by white nationalist and segregationist [[Jared Taylor]]. PFS Founder Hans-Hermann Hoppe presented his remarks "On the Nature of Man, Truth, and Justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kinsella |first=Stephan| date= September 26, 2013 |title=PFS 2013 and 2014 Annual Meetings |url=http://propertyandfreedom.org/2013/09/pfs-2013-and-2014-annual-meetings/#more-826}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured lectures by [[LSU Law Center|LSU]] law school graduate [[Stephan Kinsella]] on the legal structure of an [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarchist]] society; lectures by Hoppe on [[Murray Rothbard|Rothbardian]] economics; and discussions on the role of race in America by racialist scientist [[Richard Lynn]] and white nationalists [[Jared Taylor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Property and Freedom Society |title=Property and Freedom Society—8th Annual Meeting—Speakers &amp; Topics|url=http://propertyandfreedom.org/2013/01/property-and-freedom-society-8th-annual-meeting-speakers-topics/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard B. Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OFLW4-gwBU&lt;/ref&gt; Other speakers who have spoken at PFS include: [[Paul Gottfried]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYdmwh-XTcg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Brimelow]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VaowmPtpm8&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Derbyshire]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-w4tqkHuEQ&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Justin Raimondo]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJUaj7IALMw&lt;/ref&gt; English [[classical liberal]] and [[Libertarian Alliance]] Director [[Sean Gabb]] has spoken at a number of meetings on a variety of topics including the link between [[conservatism]] and liberty, the case against the [[War of American Independence]], and the life and politics of [[Enoch Powell]].

== Records of Meetings ==
Sean Gabb has produced a record of several meetings of the Property and Freedom Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seangabb.co.uk/category/property-and-freedom-society/|title=Meetings of the Property and Freedom Society|last=Gabb|first=Sean|date=|website=Sean Gabb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of racism==

Noting the [[Racialism|racialist]] affiliations of Richard Lynn and Jared Taylor, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] condemned the PFS as a "serious academic racist event" populated by the "movers and shakers" of the racialist movement. A May 11, 2007 ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' article described the [[Anti-Defamation League]]'s criticism of PFS and noted that Lynn has described black people as "more psychopathic than whites".&lt;ref&gt;Mower, Lawrence (May 11, 2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20070313193453/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Mar-11-Sun-2007/news/13063858.html "Researchers tied to hate groups get invitations."] ''Las Vegas Review-Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 Anti-Defamation League report about "increased cooperation" between European and American racists referred to Taylor as a white supremacist and cited his appearance at the 2013 PFS conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/domestic-extremism-terrorism/c/racists-in-europe-and-the.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ralph Townsend''' (27 November 1900 – 25 January 1976) was an American [[author]], [[consul (representative)|consul]] and [[political activist]] noted for his [[United States non-interventionism#Non-interventionism before entering World War II|opposition to the entry of the United States into World War II]]. He served in the foreign service as a consul stationed in Canada and China from 1931 to 1933. Shortly after returning to the United States he came to prominence through his book ''[[Ways That Are Dark: The Truth About China]]'', a harsh critique of Chinese culture which became a widely controversial bestseller. Townsend became a  prominent advocate of non-interventionism, and in the 1930s and 1940s was well known for his vocal opposition to the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration's foreign policy from a pro-Japanese and pro-neutrality point of view.

Following the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|US entry into World War II]] Townsend was arrested for acting as a Japanese agent without registering under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]]. He pleaded guilty, admitting that he had accepted payments before the war from a [[Japanese Committee on Trade and Information|propaganda organization funded by the Japanese government]], but denying that he was a Japanese agent. He received a prison sentence and while serving was involved in the [[Great Sedition Trial]]. After the war Townsend moved to [[Fairfax, Virginia]], where he died on 25 January 1976. His writings continue to be influential in far-right circles.

==Early life, 1900–33==
Ralph Townsend was born on 27 November 1900&lt;ref&gt;The Department of State, ''Register of the Department of State Biographic Register 1932'' (Washington DC: United States Government Printing Office, 1932), 255.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Raynham, North Carolina|Raynham]], North Carolina to "one of Robeson county's oldest and most prominent families."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4788010/townsend_faces_serious_charges/ "Townsend Faces Serious Charges,"] ''The Robesonian'', 2 February 1942, 6. Retrieved March 30, 2016 – via [[Newspapers.com]] {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Richard Walter Townsend (1859–1937) and Mara Aurora McDuffie Townsend (1866–1906). He had four sisters and brothers, including [[Dallas Townsend, Sr.]].

Retrieved March 30, 2016 – via [[Newspapers.com]] {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a journalist in [[San Francisco]] for several years before returning to New York where he taught English at Columbia University from 1927 to 1930.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;&lt;ref name="montreal"/&gt; On 11 November 1930 he passed the foreign service test and was posted to [[Montreal]], Canada, as vice-consul on 20 December 1930.&lt;ref&gt;"Pass Foreign Service Test," ''The New York Times'', 12 November 1930, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Department of State, ''Foreign Service List 1931'' (Washington DC: United States Government Printing Office, 1931), 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

His second assignment was to [[Shanghai]], where he officially served as vice-consul between 10 December 1931 and 9 January 1932,&lt;ref name="service list"&gt;The Department of State, ''Foreign Service List 1932'' (Washington DC: United States Government Printing Office, 1932), 62, 79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Seven Promoted In Foreign Service," ''The New York Times'', 17 January 1932, N2.&lt;/ref&gt; though a two-month temporary detail kept him in the city long enough to witness the [[Shanghai Incident]] firsthand.&lt;ref name="robeson"&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4788038/native_of_robeson_well_known_author/ "Native of Robeson Well Known Author, lecturer,"] ''The Robesonian'', 1 February 1934, 4.

==Writing on Asian affairs, 1933–37==
Townsend's experiences in China formed the basis of his first book ''Ways That Are Dark: The Truth About China'', the release of which on 10 November 1933 put Townsend in the spotlight both nationally and internationally. Billed as doing "for China what [[Katherine Mayo]] did for [[Mother India (book)|Mother India]]",&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 10 November 1933, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Townsend's book included a controversial critique of Chinese society and culture. At a time when China was in the grip of civil strife, Townsend believed that the source of its problems lay in fundamental defects in the ethics of its people,&lt;ref&gt;Townsend (1933), 26.&lt;/ref&gt; including above all their propensity for dishonesty, lack of fixed loyalties outside of their family group, and inability to cooperate effectively with one another, as well as their greed, physical cowardice, and lack of critical thinking skills.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend (1933), 48–117.&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that the "outstanding characteristics" of the Chinese people "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves"&lt;ref&gt;Townsend (1933), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; and predicts no end to chaotic conditions within the country.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend (1933), 244.&lt;/ref&gt; He also favorably contrasts what he considers Japan's sensible policies toward China with the naively "sentimentalist" ones adopted by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend (1933), 173–174, 287, 297–298, 307–315.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ways That Are Dark'' became a bestseller and attracted vociferous reactions from both critics and supporters.&lt;ref name="robeson"/&gt; Writing for ''[[Current History]]'', E. Francis Brown praised the book as "a welcome antidote to much that has been written in recent years and some of its conclusions might be well pondered by those who shape America's Far Eastern Policy,"&lt;ref&gt;E. Francis Brown, "Books of the Month: National and International Problems – The Truth About China," ''Current History'', January 1934, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; but by contrast the prominent [[Sinology|sinologist]] [[Owen Lattimore]] denounced the work as "a general indictment of a whole race" which lacked insight, relied on second-hand accounts, and would "only convince people who are convinced already."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Lattimore, "A Long Way From The Whole Truth About China," ''The New York Times'', 10 December 1933, BR9.&lt;/ref&gt; The book itself was entangled in the political turmoil it discussed, being banned by the government of China but distributed free of charge by the government of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;"Townsend and the Ways That Are Dark," ''The China Weekly Review'', 2 June 1934, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"American's Book Banned in China," ''Berkeley Daily Gazette'', 26 January 1935, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Robesonian]]'', a newspaper of Townsend's native county, reported in February 1934 that he had "aroused more glowing praise and bitter abuse for his lectures and written comments on China than any other recent speaker and writer on Far East affairs."&lt;ref name="robeson"/&gt; Townsend moved from New York back to San Francisco in 1934 where he continued to write and give lectures on Asian issues as well as teaching classes at Stanford University and advertising for the [[San Joaquin Light and Power Corporation]].&lt;ref name="robeson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"College Avenue," ''Berkeley Daily Gazette'', 14 October 1935, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''To Promote the Defense of the United States: Hearings Before The Committee On Foreign Relations United States Senate Part 1'' (Washington DC: United States Government Printing Office, 1941), 802.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1941 he resided in a number of Californian cities near San Francisco.&lt;ref name="census"&gt;''1940 United States Federal Census'' (Washington, DC: National Archives and Records Administration, 1940), 9A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Behind the Scenes," ''Scribner's Commentator'', March 1936, 191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Townsend (1936), xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Alumni News'', 21 January 1938, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"US Indicts 6 Bay Men As Japan Agents," ''Oakland Tribune'', 28 January 1942, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Townsend published his second book, ''Asia Answers'', in which he heaps praise on what he deems to be Japan's thriving political, economic, and cultural model and its growing and positive influence in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend (1936), 174–186, 239–241, 265–272.&lt;/ref&gt; He attributes [[anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States]] to pro-communist "liberals", above all the sensationalist newspaper editors and journalists who, he believes, despise Japan due to its status as the leading capitalist nation in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend (1936), 50–65, 87–91, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; He condemns liberals for having already wrecked the US economy,&lt;ref&gt;Townsend (1936), 175–176, 256.&lt;/ref&gt; warns of a possible communist takeover of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Townsend (1936), 97, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; and ends by advocating that America resist anti-Japanese warmongering and adopt a foreign policy of neutrality towards Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend (1936), 255, 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Townsend predicted that ''Asia Answers'' might have a frosty reception from reviewers because of what he alleged to be the pro-Soviet biases of the media,&lt;ref&gt;Townsend (1936), 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed, the book received negative coverage in ''The China Weekly Review'',&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. Townsend 'Answers' His 'Ways That Are Dark'," ''The China Weekly Review'', 13 March 1937, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Other New Books," ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 6 March 1937, 172.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times of India]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Studies of Japan," ''The Times of India'', 23 April 1937, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Living Age'', the last of which deemed ''Asia Answers'' a work "suspiciously similar to press releases by the Tokyo Foreign Office" which would appeal to "none except avowed Fascists".&lt;ref&gt;Leo Gurko, "Other New Books," ''The Living Age'', February 1937, 548.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the book's detractors was also [[Pearl S. Buck]] who described it as "so fraught with the prejudices and personality of the writer that it is impossible to criticize any of it without involving the author's whole scheme."&lt;ref&gt;Pearl S. Buck, "Asia Book-Shelf," ''Asia: Journal of the American Asiatic Association'', January 1937, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the book was received more positively in Japan and in [[Manchukuo]], where Sadatomo Koyama, a leader in the Manchuria Youth League, declared that "[Townsend's] understanding of China is impeccable" and strongly promoted the work.&lt;ref name="ankoku"&gt;Tanaka, 308–309.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1937 Townsend made a trip to Japan coinciding with the release of the book's Japanese translation.&lt;ref name="ankoku"/&gt;

==Advocate of non-interventionism, 1937–41==
[[File:Halfway Neutrality silk boycott cartoon.png|thumb|right|Townsend often used economic arguments in opposition to confrontation with Japan. This picture, from the pamphlet, ''There Is No Halfway Neutrality'', argues that boycotting raw silk from Japan would mainly harm US clothes-makers.]]After returning from Japan, Townsend, who described himself as a "conservative",&lt;ref name="mintz"&gt;Mintz, 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; was highly active in writing articles, delivering lectures, and making radio broadcasts in support of the movement to keep the United States out of the conflicts in Asia and Europe.&lt;ref name="mintz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Japanese Initiate New Propaganda Drive to Re-Establish US-Nippon Friendship," ''China Weekly Review'', 30 July 1938, 274–277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dillard Stokes, "Former Jap Consulate Secretary Tells District Court of Propaganda Scheme," ''The Washington Post'', 20 May 1942, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In explaining the reason for his participation in the pro-neutrality movement, Townsend stated that while serving as a consul abroad he had "learned enough of the rottenness of international politics&amp;nbsp;... to wish to do my part of peace for this country."&lt;ref&gt;''To Promote the Defense of the United States: Hearings Before The Committee On Foreign Relations United States Senate Part 1'' (Washington DC: United States Government Printing Office, 1941), 795.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claiming that publishers would no longer accept anti-interventionist books, Townsend began self-publishing pamphlets.&lt;ref name="then and now"&gt;Ralph Townsend, "Sedition&amp;nbsp;... Then and Now," ''American Mercury'', Summer 1968, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1938 and 1940 he wrote a series of pamphlets which were extremely popular and widely circulated among anti-interventionists.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, 136, 148, 185, 195, 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of them, ''The High Cost of Hate'' and ''America Has No Enemies In Asia'', had a circulation of at least 60,000 copies, while another, ''There Is No Halfway Neutrality'' printed 30,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, 413.&lt;/ref&gt; The last pamphlet in the series, ''Seeking Foreign Trouble'', attracted the attention of the German embassy in Washington DC which bought and distributed more than 500 copies of it.&lt;ref&gt;Rogge, 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his pamphlets, Townsend speaks out against boycotting products from Japan, noting that America does considerably more trade with Japan than China and arguing that peaceful trade with Japan and Nazi Germany would serve the interests of American workers and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Townsend, ''The High Cost Of Hate'' (San Francisco: self-published, 1939), 29, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Townsend, ''There Is No Halfway Neutrality'' (San Francisco: self-published, 1938), 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He blames "[[Communism|red]] elements" within China for starting the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]],&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Townsend, ''Does Japan Slam the Door against American Trade in Areas of Japanese Influence in Asia?'' (San Francisco: Japanese Chamber of Commerce, 1938), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Townsend, ''America Has No Enemies in Asia'' (San Francisco: self-published, 1938), 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; but praises Japan for the "humane" manner in which its armed forces have behaved in China,&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Townsend, ''There Is No Halfway Neutrality'' (San Francisco: self-published, 1938), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; believing that it is only the Soviet Union and "a powerful minority" of pro-communist Americans who are conspiring to push America to war with Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Townsend, ''The High Cost Of Hate'' (San Francisco: self-published, 1939), 54–55, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Townsend, ''America Has No Enemies in Asia'' (San Francisco: self-published, 1938), 5–6, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Townsend predicts that if the Chinese won their war with Japan, the result would be a [[Chinese Communist Revolution|communist takeover of China]],&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Townsend, ''There Is No Halfway Neutrality'' (San Francisco: self-published, 1938), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; but he dismisses the idea that Japan might [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|launch an attack on the United States]] as "simply too idiotic to discuss."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Townsend, ''The High Cost of Hate'' (San Francisco: self-published, 1939), 50.&lt;/ref&gt; On Europe he avers similarly that [[World War II|German conduct]] is largely a defensive reaction to British and French attempts to "obliterate the Germans as an entity".&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Townsend, ''Seeking Foreign Trouble'' (San Francisco: self-published, 1940), 3, 5–6, 35, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Townsend became an active member of [[America First Committee|America First]] after its formation in 1940, and was invited to speak at America First meetings on at least two occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;Ralph Townsend, ''An Appeal To Patriotic Americans'' (Washington DC: self-published, 1943), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Townsend, however, would appear as a private citizen when he came before the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] on 8 February 1941 in opposition to the [[Lend-Lease Act]].&lt;ref&gt;Doenecke (2000), 194, 437.&lt;/ref&gt; In a widely publicized&lt;ref&gt;''Town Meeting: Shall We Guarantee Peace in the Pacific?'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1941), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; testimony, Townsend condemned the legislation as tantamount to "a war bill" that would "assign dictatorial powers to the President" and would "make America the unmistakable aggressor against nations which have not sought objectively to molest us."&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Albright, "Six Denounce Bill," ''The Washington Post'', 11 February 1941, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''To Promote the Defense of the United States: Hearings Before The Committee On Foreign Relations United States Senate Part 1'' (Washington DC: United States Government Printing Office, 1941), 795, 799, 802.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Townsend speaks.jpg|thumb|right|Townsend argues against interventionism in Asia at a nationally broadcast town hall meeting in Seattle in March 1941]]
Townsend's defense of Germany and Japan led him to be labelled as an "agent" and a "propagandist" by his opponents, charges which Townsend denied.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sayers, "Japan's Undercover Drive in America," ''Friday'', 14 February 1941, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Japan Spends Millions To Make The World 'Understand'," ''China Weekly Review'', 15 October 1938, 219–220.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Fifth Column, "Japanese Propaganda: To The Editor," ''China Weekly Review'', 19 October 1940, 213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"War in China," Propaganda Analysis, 1 February 1939, 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; His activism brought him to the attention of George Teeple Eggleston, editor of ''[[Scribner's Magazine|Scribner's Commentator]]'', an anti-interventionist magazine based in [[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin|Lake Geneva]], Wisconsin, and in June 1941 Townsend accepted an offer to move to Lake Geneva to serve as a contributor to the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Eggleston, 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Townsend became an assistant editor of ''The Herald''.

==Arrest and imprisonment, 1941–44==
Townsend's first run-in with the law occurred on 25 November 1941 when federal prosecutors investigating German-funded propaganda in the United States sought him to answer questions before a grand jury about ''Scribner's Commentator''.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard Stokes, "U.S. Hunting Key Nazi Agent Probe Witness," ''The Washington Post'', 25 November 1941, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; When he could not be found at his home in Lake Geneva a nationwide manhunt was launched, but three weeks later Townsend came forward willingly, claiming he had simply been on vacation in the southern United States and hadn't known he was wanted by the government.&lt;ref name="stokes"&gt;Dillard Stokes, "Probe Jury Will Question Writer Today," ''The Washington Post'', 16 December 1941, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December he stated that he had no knowledge about how ''Scribner's Commentator'' was financed, but had strong confidence in the magazine's owners who he knew to be "good Americans."&lt;ref name="stokes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dillard Stokes, "Jury to Probe Jap Activities Up to Attack," ''The Washington Post'', 17 December 1941, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that although he had worked to prevent the outbreak of a conflict, he was now fully supportive of the US war effort. It emerged later that Nazi German agents had been surreptitiously bankrolling the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Rogge, 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January 1942, FBI agents arrived at Townsend's home and arrested him for having acted as a Japanese agent without registering under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]] of 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard Stokes, "Scribner's Writer Seized As Jap Agent," ''The Washington Post'', 29 January 1942, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Department of Justice, ''Report of the Attorney General to the Congress of the United States on the Administration of the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938'' (Washington DC: United States Government Printing Office, 1945), 537.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Special Committee on Un-American Activities, ''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States'' (Washington DC: United States Government Printing Office, 1943), 214.&lt;/ref&gt; A federal investigation into Japanese propaganda which had begun in November 1941 discovered that Townsend had received payments from the [[Japanese Committee on Trade and Information]], a Japanese propaganda organization which had existed between 1937 and 1940.&lt;ref name="Indicted For Distributing Pro-Jap 1942"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Three Americans Held as Jap Agents After Skillful Sleuthing by G-Men," ''Port Arthur News'', 9 February 1942, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Townsend denied being a paid Japanese agent and claimed to be a victim of political persecution,&lt;ref&gt;"Foreign Agent Charge Denied By Townsend," ''Madison Capital Times'', 29 January 1942, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; he did admit to having accepting money from the Committee, stating that it was merely a payment in exchange for the bulk sale of his pamphlets.&lt;ref name="appeal"/&gt; Even so, Townsend opted to plead guilty on 27 March and argued for a lenient sentence on the grounds that he was not aware that his acts were illegal.&lt;ref&gt;"Writer Guilty As Jap Agent," ''The Washington Post'', 28 March 1942, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Lesser Term Denied To Townsend," ''The Washington Post'', 18 July 1942, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Townsend also solicited the support of anti-interventionist politicians and he was sent favorable character references by both former Senator [[Rush D. Holt, Sr.|Rush D. Holt]]&lt;ref&gt;William E. Coffey, "Isolationism and Pacifism: Senator Rush D. Holt and American Foreign Policy," ''West Virginia History'', 1992, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and his longtime friend Senator [[Gerald Nye]], the latter of whom described Townsend as "a loyal and patriotic American citizen".&lt;ref&gt;Cole, 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding justice T. Alan Goldsborough was, however, unmoved, and deeming his crimes "repulsive, obscene and macabre", Townsend was sentenced on 12 June to between 8 and 24 months in prison and was incarcerated in Washington DC.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard Stokes, "Griffin Denies Memory of Viereck Pay," ''The Washington Post'', 13 June 1942, 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Seldes]], "Associate of Japanese Agent, Now in Jail," ''In Fact'', 12 July 1943, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defendant in the Great Sedition Trial===
Townsend became a defendant during his prison term in what would become known as the "Great Sedition Trial". The trial arose from  Roosevelt's conviction, against advice from his Attorney-General [[Francis Biddle]], that the most vocal in defending Nazi Germany be tried for subversion.&lt;ref name="liberties"&gt;Samuel Walker, 116–117.&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 1942 Townsend and 27 other Americans were charged under the [[Smith Act]] and the [[Espionage Act]] with having participated in a German-backed conspiracy to publish seditious literature seeking to undermine the morale of members of the United States military.&lt;ref&gt;Dillard Stokes, "28 Indicted in Wide Conspiracy To Corrupt Army and Navy," ''The Washington Post'', 23 July 1942, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schonbach, 415.&lt;/ref&gt; The indictment cited the following statement of Townsend's, which he had written in 1941 prior to US entry into the war, as proof that he had committed sedition: &lt;blockquote&gt;With a fifth of the earth's people kept under their rule by force, [the British] bleat of fighting to liberate subject populations. Fighting now for the triumph of the bloodiest dictatorship ever known – Soviet Russia – they microphone to listening Americans their pious horror of dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;William Henry Chamberlin, "Civil Liberties: Slogan or Reality?," ''The Christian Century'', 13 January 1943, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Townsend was arraigned on 20 August, but strongly questioned the view that his writings were subversive as well as the legal foundations of the charges.&lt;ref&gt;"Draft Board Asked To Find Suspects," ''The Washington Post'', 4 August 1942, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Arraignments Set on Morale Charges," ''The New York Times'', 20 August 1942, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Paull, "Author Spends Hour With Sedition Jury," ''The Washington Post'', 29 October 1943, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the other defendants, Townsend was as before strongly defended by senators with anti-interventionist sympathies, including Gerald Nye who said the defendants were no more guilty of sedition than he had been for speaking out against intervening in the war.&lt;ref name="steele"&gt;Steele, 214–217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Nye Doubts Merits of Charges Against 33 to Undermine Morale," ''The Washington Star'', 15 January 1943, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact there were from the beginning many concerns even within the US government about the validity of the proceedings and their constitutionality as no clear evidence had yet been uncovered to demonstrate that the defendants were in collusion with Nazi Germany or with each other.&lt;ref name="liberties"/&gt;&lt;ref name="steele"/&gt;

These problems lead to repeated delays in the formal opening of the trial and the indictment had to be laid down a second time on 4 January 1943 after the first had expired.&lt;ref name="steele"/&gt; More delays arose, however, and when the indictment was laid down for a third time on 3 January 1944, Townsend's name had been dropped from the list.&lt;ref&gt;"U.S. Indicts 30, Alleging Nazi Plot To Incite Mutiny and Revolution," ''The New York Times'', 4 January 1944, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Francis Biddle initially said that Townsend would still be subject to prosecution in the future, in the end no further actions were taken.&lt;ref&gt;"US Indictment Against Ralph Townsend Stands," ''The News-Journal'', 6 January 1944, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sedition"&gt;Michael Collins Piper and Ken Hoop, "The Great Sedition Trial of 1944," ''Barnes Review'', November/December 1999, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; By then Townsend had was bankrupted by legal costs and was deserted by most of his friends.&lt;ref name="sedition"/&gt; Biddle himself later called the sedition case "a dreary farce".&lt;ref name="liberties"/&gt;

At the time ''The Washington Post'' reported that before the war Townsend had accepted money from an individual connected to German agents in return for circulating anti-British pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;Drew Pearson, "The Washington Merry-Go-Round: The Nazi Network," ''The Washington Post'', 26 October 1942, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all this Townsend still insisted that, "I was never anybody's foreign agent. All I published was independently written and 100 per cent American",&lt;ref&gt;"Townsend Enters Denial," ''The New York Times'', 4 August 1942, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; a stance which he maintained for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref name="then and now"/&gt;

==Post-war life, 1945–76==
In the early-1950s Townsend moved to Fairfax, Virginia and by the time of his death was considered a "prominent resident".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4788059/deaths_and_funerals/ "Deaths And Funerals,"] ''The Robesonian'', 11 February 1976, 42. Retrieved March 30, 2016 – via [[Newspapers.com]] {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped organize the Fairfax Chamber of Commerce, of which he was the executive director, and in this capacity played a leading role in lobbying the [[CIA]] to locate [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|its headquarters]] in Virginia.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;"Ralph M. Townsend, Author Civic Leader," ''The Washington Post'', February 14, 1976, C7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Fairfax C of C Members Pay Prize Deficit," ''The Washington Post'', 27 August 1955, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marie D. Smith, "Industries Respond To Fairfax Welcome," ''The Washington Post'', 10 July 1955, B5.&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked in advance of conservation. In 1967 he appeared before the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs as a member of [[Defenders of Wildlife]]&lt;ref&gt;''San Rafael Wilderness: Hearings Before The Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs House of Representatives: June 19, 20, and 21, 1967'' (Washington DC: United States Government Printing Office, 1967), 135.&lt;/ref&gt; and between 1972 and 1976 served on that organization's board of directors where he was known for "his insistence on sound financial management."&lt;ref name="defenders"&gt;"Ralph M. Townsend," ''Defenders'', April 1976, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

Townsend maintained friendships with far-right figures after the war, including [[Harry Elmer Barnes]] and [[Willis Carto]],&lt;ref name="sedition"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Townsend, ''Ways That Are Dark: The Truth About China'' (Washington DC: Barnes Review, 1997), back cover.&lt;/ref&gt; and for a time he worked as an editor and contributor to Carto's anti-Semitic magazine, ''[[The American Mercury]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''American Mercury'', Spring 1972, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''American Mercury'', Winter 1974, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; which introduced Townsend as "a former Foreign Service officer who made the mistake of fighting FDR's war plans".&lt;ref&gt;''American Mercury'', Summer 1968, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Townsend died in Fairfax on 25 January 1976 at the age of 75.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

==Legacy and assessment==
Historians have noted the stridency with which Townsend put forward his pro-Japanese views before World War II.&lt;ref name="mintz"/&gt; Justus Doenecke, for instance, described Townsend as "The most adamant and extreme of the voices in America defending Japanese policy."&lt;ref&gt;Doenecke (1987), 346.&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Papachristou concurs that "Few anti-imperialists were as extreme as isolationist Ralph Townsend",&lt;ref&gt;Judith Papachristou, "An Exercise in Anti-Imperialism: The Thirties," ''American Studies'', Spring 1974, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; though Townsend himself rejected the "isolationist" label during his life,&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Townsend, ''There Is No Halfway Neutrality'' (San Francisco: self-published, 1938), 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and instead called himself a "realist" and "Pro-Peace".&lt;ref&gt;Townsend (1936), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Townsend, "Sedition&amp;nbsp;... Then and Now," ''American Mercury'', Summer 1968, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Townsend is still held in esteem by many members of the extreme right in the United States, and recently in Japan as well. After his death his widow Janet turned over his papers to Larry Humphreys, an Oklahoma multimillionaire and supporter of right-wing [[Militia movement|militia]] and [[Christian Identity]] groups, who referred to Townsend as a man who "knew FDR was trying to entice Japan into attacking the United States, and FDR had him jailed".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Hand, "The Making of A Right-Wing Radical," ''Harrowsmith'', March/April 1987, 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Humphreys stored Townsend's papers in his so-called "Heritage Library", though today many of them are held by [[Barnes Review]], an anti-Semitic organization under the leadership of Townsend's old friend Willis Carto.&lt;ref name="sedition"/&gt; In 1997, Barnes Review re-published ''Ways That Are Dark: The Truth About China'' for the first time since World War II with a new foreword written by Carto, who praised Townsend as "a profound, genuinely courageous and painfully honest writer".&lt;ref&gt;Willis Carto, "Publisher's Foreword," in ''Ways That Are Dark: The Truth About China'', (Washington DC: Barnes Review, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 a Japanese translation of the Barnes Review edition of ''Ways That Are Dark'' was released in Japan where it became a runaway success&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, 307.&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly elevated Townsend to "hero" status among the Japanese far right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2004/10/11/commentary/new-mindset-is-the-only-salve|title=New mindset is the only salve|author=Gregory Clark|work=Japan Times|date=11 October 2004|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opinion of recent scholars on the quality of his writing have been mixed. Limin Chu, who analyzed his articles on China for the ''[[Overland Monthly|Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine]]'', considered some of the claims as "either incredibly gullible or deliberately vicious",&lt;ref&gt;Limin Chu, "China and Sino-US Relations, 1900–1930: The Overland Monthly," ''Sino-American Relations: An International Quarterly'', Summer 2001, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; while historian Justus Doenecke described his pamphlets as "crudely written".&lt;ref&gt;Doenecke (1987), 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Peter O'Connor, professor at [[Musashino University]], found the same pamphlets "well-argued and researched."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Registration authorities exist for many standards organizations, such as ANNA (Association of National Numbering Agencies for [[ISIN]]), the [[Object Management Group]], [[W3C]], [[IEEE]] and others. In general, registration authorities all perform a similar function, in promoting the use of a particular standard through facilitating its use. This may be by applying the standard, where appropriate, or by verifying that a particular application satisfies the standard's tenants. Maintenance agencies, in contrast, may change an element in a standard based on set rules – such as the creation or change of a currency code when a currency is created or revalued (i.e. TRL to TRY for [[Turkish lira]]). The [[Object Management Group]] has an additional concept of [[certified provider]], which is deemed an entity permitted to perform some functions on behalf of the registration authority, under specific processes and procedures documented within the standard for such a role.

An ISO registration authority (RAs) is not authorized to update standards but provides a registration function to facilitate implementation of an International Standard (e.g. ISBN number for books). Frequently, facilitating the implementation of an ISO standard’s requirements is best suited, by its nature, to one entity, an RA. This, de facto, creates a monopoly situation and this is why care needs to be taken with respect to the functions carried out and the fees charged to avoid an abuse of such a situation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iso.org/iso/registration_authorities_guidelines_for_committees.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, there is a formal legal contract in place between the standards body, such as the ISO General Secretariat, and the selected registration authority.

ISO registration authorities differ from a [[maintenance agency]].  Maintenance agencies are authorized to update particular elements in an International Standard and as a matter of policy, the secretariats of MAs are assigned to bodies forming part of the ISO system (member bodies or organizations to which a member body delegates certain tasks in its country). The membership of MAs and their operating procedures are subject to approval by the Technical Management Board.

While registration authorities for a particular standard typically do not change, the position is not formally guaranteed and is subject to review and reassignment to a different firm or organization. In some cases, the concept of a registration authority may not exist for a standard at all.

By further example, the equivalent registration authority organization for [[Internet standard]]s is the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF

'''Revolutionary Organization 17 November''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Επαναστατική Οργάνωση 17 Νοέμβρη, ''Epanastatiki Organosi dekaefta Noemvri''), also known as '''17N''' or the '''17 November Group''', was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[far-left]] militant organization formed in 1975 and led by [[Alexandros Giotopoulos]]. 17N conducted an extensive [[urban guerrilla]] campaign against the Greek state, [[bank]]s, and businesses, as well as [[United States|American]], [[Turkey|Turkish]], and [[United Kingdom|British]] targets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astinomia.gr/index.php?option=ozo_content&amp;perform=view&amp;id=1317&amp;Itemid=171&amp;lang= Press release], Greek Police {{el icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=[[Terrorism Act 2000]] |number=11 |year=2000 |article=2 |articletype=Schedule |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/schedule/2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.tr/_p_no_78--_18-may-2007_-press-release-regarding-the-17-november-terrorist-organisation___unofficial-translation_-__p_.en.mfa |title=18 May 2007, Press Release Regarding the 17 November Terrorist Organisation |date=18 May 2007 |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Turkey |access-date=18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm Foreign Terrorist Organizations], U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt; The organization committed 103 known [[armed robbery]], [[assassination]], and [[bombing]] attacks, during which 23 people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ahistoryofgreece.com/press/november17terrorists.htm November 17 Terrorist Organization Chronology of Attacks&lt;/ref&gt; 17N was designated a [[terrorist]] group by Greece, the United Kingdom, Turkey, the United States, and disbanded in 2002 after the arrest and trial of many of its members.

==Formation==
The group's name, 17N, refers to the final day of the 1973 [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]], in which a protest against the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Greek Military Junta (1967–1974)]], also known as the [[Regime of the Colonels]], took place. The uprising was bloodily suppressed by the army. In addition to assassinations, kidnappings, and symbolic attacks on corporate and government offices, 17N supported its operations with at least 11 bank robberies, netting approximately US$3.5 million. Members of 17N kept detailed financial records, found in one of their safe houses in 2002, to document that the stolen money was used for revolutionary purposes.

==Attacks==
17N's first attack, on 23 December 1975, was against the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s station chief in [[Athens]], [[Richard Welch]]. Welch was gunned down outside his residence by three assailants, in front of his wife and driver.&lt;ref name="Nomikos"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nomikos|first1=John|title=Terrorism, Media, and Intelligence in Greece: Capturing the 17 November Group|journal=International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence|date=2007|volume=20|issue=1|pages=65–78|doi=10.1080/08850600600888896|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08850600600888896}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} 17N's repeated claims of responsibility were ignored until December 1976, when it murdered the former intelligence Chief of the Greek security police, [[Evangelos Mallios]] and left its proclamation at the scene. In January 1980, 17N murdered [[Pantelis Petrou]], the deputy director of the riot police (MAT), and his driver. It also intervened with two long proclamations offering theoretical guidance to the Greek armed struggle and criticizing a rival group, [[Revolutionary People's Struggle]] (ELA) for poor target selection and operational incompetence.

17N resumed its attacks in November 1983, killing the deputy chief of the Joint United States Military Aid Group to Greece [[George Tsantes]]. In 1985, it broadened its targeting with the murder of conservative newspaper publisher [[Nikos Momferatos]]. The proclamation left near his body accused Momferatos of CIA connections and complained that Greece "remained a puppet regime in the hands of the American imperialists and the economic establishment." In 1986, 17N murdered Dimitris Angelopoulos, one of Greece's leading industrialists, charging that he and other members of Greece's "lumpen big bourgeoisie class" were plundering Greece at the expense of workers.

17N responded to the 1988 [[George Koskotas]] scandal with a wave of murders and kidnappings. In the 1989 parliamentary elections, 17N urged voters to deface their ballots with the 17N star. The assassination of [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] member of parliament [[Pavlos Bakoyannis]] in September 1989 prompted public outrage, including among Greek communists who respected Bakoyannis as a courageous anti-Junta journalist. The group abandoned its electoral pretensions and took a more nationalist turn.

Other victims included [[United States Navy|US Navy]] Captain [[William Nordeen]], the U.S. defense attache, whose car was destroyed by a car bomb a few meters from his residence on 28 June 1988, and U.S. Air Force Sergeant Ronald O. Stewart, who was killed by a remotely-detonated bomb outside his apartment on 12 March 1991.

In addition to its anti-American and anti-capitalist agenda, the group was also opposed to [[Turkey]] and [[NATO]]. [[Çetin Görgü]], the Turkish press attaché, was shot in his car on 7 October 1991; Ömer Haluk Sipahioğlu, a Turkish embassy counselor, was shot on an Athens street on 4 July 1994; ship and shipyard owner Constantinos Peratikos was shot leaving his office on 28 May 1997; and British military attaché Brigadier [[Stephen Saunders (British Army officer)|Stephen Saunders]] was shot on 8 June 2000.

17N used two .45 [[M1911]] semi-automatics as its "signature weapons".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/news/content.asp?aid=18879 Trademark Colt pistol is identified] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120171110/http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/news/content.asp?aid=18879 |date=2007-11-20 }}, ''Kathimerini'', 18 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; While face-to-face assassination was the early modus operandi, in 1985 the group exploded its first bomb, targeting a bus full of riot police; a long cable was used to detonate explosives made of stolen quarrying explosives, which killed one.

In October 1986, 17N bombed four tax offices in its first low-level attack against property. In December 1988, 17N stole 114 obsolete anti-tank rockets from a poorly-guarded Greek military depot. Between 1990 and 1999, 17N conducted 24 rocket attacks, all but three of them aimed at property rather than human targets. In November 1990, a rocket attack against the armored limousine of shipowner Vardis Vardinogiannis failed. In 1991, 17N rocketed a riot police bus, killing one officer and wounding 14. In July 1992, a young passerby, Thanos Axarlian, was killed in a failed rocket attack on Economy Minister [[Ioannis Paleokrassas]].

After their inaugural attack on the CIA station chief, the group tried to get mainstream newspapers to publish their manifesto. Their first proclamation, claiming the murder of Richard Welch, was first sent to "[[Libération]]" in Paris, France.  It was given to the publisher of "Libération" via the offices of Jean-Paul Sartre,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main_old.php?id=7103&amp;archive=1 Giotopoulos the son of renowned Greek Trotskyite] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202859/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/news/main_old.php?id=7103&amp;archive=1 |date=2007-09-27 }}, ''Cyprus Mail'', 20 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; but was not published. After subsequent attacks, 17N usually sent a communique to the [[Eleftherotypia]] newspaper. The group argued in its communiques that it wanted to rid Greece of U.S. bases, to remove the Turkish military from [[Cyprus]], and to sever Greece's ties to NATO and the [[European Union]].

On 7 April 1998, the group used a stolen anti-armor rocket to attack a downtown branch of the American Citibank, which caused damage but no injuries, as the warhead did not explode. The rocket was fired by remote control from a private car parked outside the bank on Drossopoulou street in the downtown district of Kypseli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/greek/apeen/1998/98-04-08_1.apeen.html|title=Athens News Agency: News in English (PM), 98-04-08|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
On 29 June 2002 Greek authorities captured an injured suspect, [[Savvas Xiros]], following a failed bombing attempt on the [[Minoan Flying Dolphins]] ferry company in Piraeus. A search of Xiros' person and interrogation led to the discovery of two safe houses and to the arrests of six more suspects, including two brothers of Savvas. A 58-year-old former mathematics student living underground since 1971, [[Alexandros Giotopoulos]], was identified as the group leader and was arrested on 17 July 2002 on the island of [[Lipsi]]. On 5 September, Dimitris Koufodinas, identified as the group's chief of operations, surrendered to the authorities. In all, nineteen individuals were charged with some 2,500 offenses relating to the activities of N17.

The trial of the terrorist suspects commenced in Athens on 3 March 2003, with Christos Lambrou serving as the lead prosecutor for the Greek state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/news/content.asp?aid=27078 Nov17 trial begins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120171133/http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/news/content.asp?aid=27078 |date=2007-11-20 }}, ''Kathimerini'', 3 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the 20-year statute of limitations, crimes committed before 1984 (such as the killing of the CIA station chief) could not be tried by the court. On 8 December, fifteen of the accused, including Giotopoulos and Koufodinas, were found guilty; another four defendants were acquitted for lack of evidence. The convicted members were sentenced on 17 December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/news/content.asp?aid=37570 Deadly 17 November to end its life in prison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120171137/http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/news/content.asp?aid=37570 |date=2007-11-20 }}, ''Kathimerini'', 18 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; All those convicted defendants appealed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athensnews.gr/athweb/nathens.print_unique?e=C&amp;f=13160&amp;m=A06&amp;aa=1&amp;eidos=S No TV in 17N trial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927080717/http://www.athensnews.gr/athweb/nathens.print_unique?e=C&amp;f=13160&amp;m=A06&amp;aa=1&amp;eidos=S |date=2007-09-27 }}, ''Athens News Agency'', 9 December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 May 2007, the convictions were upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spyworld-actu.com/spip.php?article4377 |title=Le démantèlement du 17-N n'a pas mis fin au terrorisme en Grèce |author=Kunz, Didier |agency=[[Le Monde]] |work=Spyworld |date=2007-05-05 |accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/international/europe/20070503.OBS5378/le_chef_dun_groupe_terroristecondamne_a_perpetuite_en_a.html

In early January 2014, Christodoulos Xyros, one of the imprisoned leaders of the organization, escaped from prison. On 6 January, he failed to report to the police after leaving prison under the condition to report to the police everyday, which he did six times in 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greece fears return of left-wing terrorism|url=http://www.dw.de/greece-fears-return-of-left-wing-terrorism/a-17347046|accessdate=9 January 2014|date=8 January 2014|agency=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken into custody while riding a bicycle in the southern suburb of [[Anavyssos]] in early January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Notorious Greek fugitive arrested on bicycle|url=https://news.yahoo.com/notorious-greek-terror-fugitive-arrested-173904033.html|accessdate=4 January 2015|date=3 January 2015|agency=[[L'Agence France-Presse (AFP)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories ==
Some Greek officials considered [[Revolutionary Struggle]] (EA), the group that fired a Chinese-made RPG-7 [[rocket-propelled grenade]] at the U.S. Embassy in Athens in January 2007, to be a spin-off of 17N. However, three self-admitted EA members arrested in April 2010 claimed that they were anarchists—a designation 17N rejected in its proclamations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://athens.indymedia.org/front.php3?lang=el&amp;article_id=1160139 Letter from P. Roupa, N. Maziotis, K. Gournas], ''Athens.Indymedia.org'', 29 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, leading politicians of the right-wing [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party, as well as the conservative press, falsely claimed that Prime Minister [[Andreas Papandreou]] was the mastermind behind 17N. Virginia Tsouderou, who became Deputy Foreign Minister in the Mitsotakis government, and journalist Giorgos Karatzaferis (later the founder and leader of a right-wing party, LAOS) claimed that terrorism in Greece was controlled by Papandreist officers of [[Hellenic National Intelligence Service]] (the Greek security and intelligence service), and named Kostas Tsimas (the head of EYP) and Colonel Alexakis as two of the supposed controllers of 17N.&lt;ref&gt;Eleftheros Tipos, 13/12/1989&lt;/ref&gt; However, after 17N members were arrested, the only connection between the terrorist organization and PASOK was the fact that Dimitris Koufontinas was a member of PAMK (the PASOK high school students organization) and an admirer of Andreas Papandreou in his late teens.

Other writers have also claimed that 17N may have been a tool of foreign secret services. In December 2005, Kleanthis Grivas published an article in ''To Proto Thema'', a Greek Sunday newspaper, in which he accused "Sheepskin", the Greek branch of [[Gladio]], [[NATO]]'s [[stay-behind]] paramilitary organization during the [[Cold War]], of the 1975 assassination of Welch, as well as of the 2000 assassination of Saunders. This was denied by the [[US State Department]], which responded that "the Greek terrorist organization '17 November' was responsible for both assassinations", and asserted that Grivas' central piece of evidence had been the "[[Westmoreland Field Manual]]," which the State Department, as well as a Congressional inquiry, had dismissed as a Soviet forgery. The State Department also highlighted the fact that, in the case of Richard Welch, "Grivas bizarrely accuses the CIA of playing a role in the assassination of one of its own senior officials" as well as the Greek government's statements to the effect that the "stay behind" network had been dismantled in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/texttrans/2006/01/20060120111344atlahtnevel0.3114282.html#axzz49h6mVGjx

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7363">'''SA8000''' is an auditable certification standard that encourages organizations to develop, maintain, and apply socially acceptable practices in the workplace.
It was developed in 1989 by '''Social Accountability International''', formerly the '''Council on Economic Priorities''', by an advisory board consisting of [[trade union]]s, [[NGO]]s, civil society organizations and companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiser.org/organization/view/087d3fa04ba3e6fdc07e15631df0c494 |title=Organization: Social Accountability International SAI |publisher=Wiser.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SA8000's criteria were developed from various industry and corporate codes to create a common standard for social welfare compliance.

==Certification ==
SA8000 certification is a management systems standard, modeled on [[ISO standards]]. The criteria require that facilities seeking to gain and maintain certification must go beyond simple compliance to the standard.  Prospective facilities must integrate it into their management practices and demonstrate ongoing compliance with the standard. SA8000 is based on the principles of international [[human rights]] norms as described in [[International Labour Organization]] conventions, the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisd.org/business/tools/systems_sa.aspx |title=SA 8000 &amp;#124; Systems &amp; standards &amp;#124; Strategies &amp; tools |publisher=Iisd.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It measures the performance of companies in eight areas important to social accountability in the workplace: child labour, forced labour, health and safety, free association and collective bargaining, discrimination, disciplinary practices, working hours and compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mallenbaker.net/csr/CSRfiles/SA8000.html |title=SA8000 - A Social Accountability Standard |publisher=Mallenbaker.net |date=2013-10-04 |accessdate=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5690">'''Scran''' is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] online resource for educational use by the public, [[school]]s, [[further education]] and [[higher education]]. It presents nearly 490,000 (still and moving) images and sounds contributed by [[museum]]s, [[Art gallery|galleries]], [[archive]]s and the [[Mass media|media]]. It was established as an educational charity in 1996 and is now part of Historic Environment Scotland, a registered [[charitable organization|charity]] and non-departmental government body.

==General description==
[[File:2ndseason.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Picture of football fans on trackside at Easter Road, 17 August 1985]]
Scran works in partnership with over 300 cultural institutions in Scotland and the rest of the UK who contribute material to the online service. The online learning resource service hosts nearly 490,000 images, movies and sounds from museums, galleries, archives and the media. Subscribers can download and reuse these for personal and educational use in accordance with the subscriber licence. The online service also provides a range of tools for users "to do stuff with things they find". A number of institutions use Scran's [[open source]] online solution - Scran-in-a-Box - to provide access to their own data.

==Organisational structure==
Until 2008, Scran was a stand-alone charity. From 2008 to 2015 it was managed by The [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]] (RCAHMS), and had two arms: The Scran Trust, a charitable arm that provided educational access to its records, and Scran Ltd., its wholly owned trading arm. In October 2015, RCAHMS merged with Historic Scotland to form a new body, [[Historic Environment Scotland]], and Scran likewise followed and merged into Historic Environment Scotland.

==Background information==

===Formation===
Scran was formed in 1996, and its founding partners were The [[National Museums of Scotland]], The [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]], [[Museums Galleries Scotland]] and, by invitation, the [[Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum]].

===Initial work===
In its first five years, it engaged in a wide-ranging scheme of grant awards which allowed cultural organisations to digitise parts of their collections to be made available for educational purposes. This was [[Millennium Commission]] funded through the UK Lottery. It developed an advanced licensing system, commended by many, in which the institution retained ownership of the digitised assets, but made these available under licence to Scran. There followed further large grant aid partner projects with NOF Digitise funding through the [[National Library of Scotland]].

===Recent work===
Scran continues to add records to its database from institutions and individuals. Technical innovations include "Create" functions that allow user creation of instant documents, the ability for users to save their favourite records to a password-protected "Stuff" account and share these with other Scran users, mapping functions and enhanced cross searching such as [[Search/Retrieve via URL|SRU]]/[[Search/Retrieve Web Service|SRW]].

===Awards===
* Silver MUSE from the [[American Alliance of Museums]] (AAM), 'In recognition of the Highest Standards of Excellence in the use of Media and Technology…'.
* The ‘Jason Farradane’ award of the Institute of Information Scientists as "an outstanding piece of work in the Information Field".
* Listed as one of the top ten [[NGfL]] sites in the [[Becta|BECTa]]/[[The Guardian|Guardian]] Awards
* Listed as one of the Top Ten Online Museums in the world by The Guardian newspaper.
* Scottish Museum of the Year award for multimedia
* British Archaeological Society / [[Channel 4]] award for multimedia

==Technical details==

===Scope===
The service hosts nearly 490,000 resources with additional educational materials and delivers a peak of 1.1 million hits per day.

===Software and hardware===
Scran utilises open source software and runs on a cluster server configuration with [[MySQL]] and [[PHP]] under [[Linux]].  The searchable database is over 7[[Gigabyte|GB]] and total storage including all assets is over 5[[Terabyte|TB]]. A number of additional websites are hosted as linked services.

===Scran-in-a-Box===
The whole system developed by Scran including ScranBase and all the tools like Create and Stuff is available for others to use as Scran-in-a Box.

'''Shelburne Museum''' is a [[museum]] of [[art museum|art]], design, and [[Americana]] located in [[Shelburne, Vermont|Shelburne]], [[Vermont]], [[United States]]. Over 150,000 works are exhibited in 39 exhibition buildings, 25 of which are historic and were relocated to the Museum grounds. It is located on {{convert|45|acre}} near [[Lake Champlain]].

[[Impressionist]] paintings, [[folk art]], [[quilts]] and textiles, [[decorative arts]], furniture, American paintings, and an array of 17th- to 20th-century artifacts are on view. Shelburne is home to collections of 19th-century American folk art, quilts, 19th- and 20th-century decoys (''see'' [[Waterfowl decoy collecting]]), and [[carriages]]. 

[[Electra Havemeyer Webb]] was a pioneering collector of American folk art and founded Shelburne Museum in 1947.&lt;ref name=sold/&gt; The daughter of [[Henry Osborne Havemeyer]] and [[Louisine Elder Havemeyer]], important collectors of [[Impressionist|Impressionism]], European and Asian art, she exercised an independent eye and passion for art, artifacts, and architecture celebrating a distinctly American aesthetic. 

When creating the Museum she took the step of collecting 18th and 19th century buildings from [[New England]] and New York in which to display the Museum's holdings, relocating 20 historic structures to Shelburne. These include houses, barns, a meeting house, a one-room schoolhouse, a lighthouse, a jail, a general store, a covered bridge, and the 220-foot steamboat Ticonderoga.

In Shelburne Mrs. Webb sought to create "an educational project, varied and alive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewes|first=Lauren B.|title=To collect in earnest : the life and work of Electra Havemeyer Webb|year=1997|publisher=Shelburne Museum|location=Shelburne, Vt.|isbn=0-939384-21-3|author2=Oliver, Celia Y. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shelburne's collections are exhibited in a village-like setting of historic New England architecture, accented by a landscape that includes over 400 lilacs, a circular formal garden, herb and heirloom vegetable gardens, and perennial gardens.

In 2013, the Pizzagalli Center for Art and Education was opened with two galleries, an auditorium and classroom, transforming the institution from seasonal (mid-May through October) to year-round operation. While the main campus operates seasonally, the Pizzagalli Center and Museum Store are open year-round. 

==History==
[[File:Shelburnemuseumbarn.JPG|thumb| A circular barn at the entrance to the museum.]]

The museum's collection was begun by [[Electra Havemeyer Webb]], one of the first people to recognize the applied and decorative arts of rural America as collectible. Webb was an avid collector of American [[folk art]] and founded the Museum in 1947. She took the step of relocating historic buildings from [[New England]] and [[New York State|New York]] to [[Shelburne, Vermont]] in which to display the Museum's holdings.

The museum has lost money and was said to have had a deficit of more than $300,000 in 1994.&lt;ref name=sold/&gt;

==Collections==
The core of the collection was formed by Electra Havemeyer Webb, a pioneering collector of American [[folk art]] who founded Shelburne Museum. Mrs. Webb exchanged ideas with other major early collectors, including Katherine Prentis Murphy, Henry and Helen Flynnt and [[Henry Francis du Pont ]](who founded Winterthur Museum and credited Mrs. Webb with inspiring him to collect American [[decorative arts]]).

Since Mrs. Webb’s death in 1960, the collections have developed with an emphasis on folk art and contemporary art as it relates to the collection. [[Cultural artifact|Artifacts]] provide insight into the craftsmanship and artistic quality of objects made and used by three centuries of Americans. Visitors experience these objects in galleries and period rooms and through interactive exhibitions and demonstrations. Transportation, farming and trade artifacts illustrate America’s industrial development from the 18th to the early 20th centuries. These collections are increasingly relevant to regional audiences from varied backgrounds as the economic base of the community shifts away from farming and small-scale production.

Shelburne Museum’s purpose is to enrich people’s lives through art, history and culture. The collection of approximately 150,000 objects is one of the most extensive and varied collections in the US and is notable for its great range, quality and depth. The outstanding collections of fine, folk and decorative art celebrate American ingenuity, creativity and craftsmanship. 

Shelburne’s folk art collection includes 1,400 wildfowl decoys and miniature carvings, 150 trade figures and signs, 120 weathervanes and 50 carousel figures, including all 40 animals from an early Dentzel carousel. The circus collection includes 600 historic posters, letters and memorabilia from [[P.T. Barnum]] and the hand-carved 3,500 piece Kirk Brothers Miniature Circus. The Roy Arnold Circus Parade recreates in miniature 112 attractions from the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show, Yankee Circus, and [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] in 525 linear feet of a special exhibition building.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 2001. American Folk Art at the Shelburne Museum by Henry Joyce and Sloane Stephens {{ISBN|978-0-939384-26-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Textiles include 770 bed coverings (including 500 [[quilts]]), 400 hooked and sewn rugs, early household [[textiles]] (1,800 samplers, laces and linens) and 2,800 costumes and accessories. The [[decorative arts]] collection has 6,650 pieces, including glass, ceramics, pewter, metalwork, scrimshaw and one of the country’s best regional collections of 18th- and 19th-century painted furniture. Over 1,000 dolls, 27 dollhouses and 1,200 doll accessories echo in miniature the museum’s collections of ceramics, [[furniture]] and other household furnishings. A major reinterpretation and related publication of the doll collection was completed in 2004. The collection of American and European toys dates from the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 2004. The Dolls of Shelburne Museum by Jean M. Burks {{ISBN|978-0-939384-28-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the museum there are some 3,200 American prints, paintings, drawings and graphics that relate to daily life. [[Visual arts of the United States|American paintings]] include works by [[Albert Bierstadt|Bierstadt]], Church, [[Mary Cassatt]], [[John Singleton Copley|Copley]], Daubigny, Field, [[Martin Johnson Heade|Heade]], Hicks, [[Winslow Homer|Homer]], [[Fitz Henry Lane|Lane]], [[Grandma Moses]], Peto and [[Andrew Wyeth]]. A significant group of European paintings and pastels from the renowned Havemeyer collection includes works by Corot, [[Edgar Degas|Degas]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] and [[Claude Monet]]; they are exhibited in furnished rooms re-created from the Webbs’ New York apartment, c. 1930, and are the only [[Impressionist|Impressionism]] pictures on public view in Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1976. Paintings and Drawing at the Shelburne Museum by Nancy c. Muller&lt;/ref&gt;

Collections also include 225 [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s (described as one of the best in the nation by Merri Ferrell, formerly curator of vehicles at The Long Island Museum of Art, History and Carriages);&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1974. Horse-Drawn Vehicles at the Shelburne Museum by Kenneth Edward Wheeling&lt;/ref&gt; 1,000 farming implements; and 5,000 hand tools that document woodworking, metalsmithing, coopering, weaving and spinning, leatherworking and woodcarving trades. Craftspeople staff working exhibits of blacksmithing, printing, spinning and weaving. An apothecary shop/physician’s office displays 2,000 patent medicines and turn of the 20th century medical instruments.

[[File:Ticonderoga (steamboat).jpg|thumb|Front view of the Ticonderoga (steamboat) located at Shelburne Museum.]]
The collections are exhibited in a setting of 38 exhibition buildings, 25 of which were relocated to the Museum; the 1871 [[Colchester Reef Light]]; 3 historic and 3 replica barns, including a 1901 Vermont [[round barn]]; a vintage operating carousel; blacksmith and wheelwright shops; a weaving shop with an operating [[Jacquard loom]]; a working exhibit of late 19th-century printing equipment; an 1840 one-room schoolhouse; an 1890 Vermont slate jail; an 1840 general store; a rare 18th-century up-and-down sawmill; a 19th-century [[covered bridge]] with 2 lanes and a footpath; [[general store]]; the reconstructed doctor's office of noted Vermont physician [[D. C. Jarvis]]; an 1890 railroad station; a 1914 steam locomotive and 1890 private rail car; and the 1906 220-foot [[steamboat]] [[Ticonderoga (steamboat)|''Ticonderoga'']], which is a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/collections/detail.php?id=8|title=Shelburne Museum collections note|website=shelburnemuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sale of art==
In 1996 the museum sold $30 million of its art to pay expenses. [[J. Watson Webb, Jr.]], the son of [[Electra Havemeyer Webb]], resigned in protest. Webb believed that the sale violated the code of ethics of the [[American Alliance of Museums]], which forbids the selling of artworks for purposes other than acquiring more art.&lt;ref name=sold&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Museum's Fortunes Rise at Auction |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/13/arts/museum-s-fortunes-rise-at-auction.html?scp=3&amp;sq=Electra%20Havemayer%20Webb%20museum&amp;st=cse |quote=The decision to sell some of its collection followed two years of debate among the museum's directors, culminating in the board chairman, J. Watson Webb, son of Electra Havemeyer Webb, resignation in January. At the time, Mr. Webb said the museum's plans to sell valuable French Impressionist works given by his mother violated the code of ethics of the American Alliance of Museums, which forbids the selling of artworks for purposes other than acquiring more art.|work=[[New York Times]] |date=November 13, 1996 |accessdate=2010-10-09 |first=Carol |last=Vogel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The funds from the sale were used to establish a Collections Care Endowment which is used to support the ongoing remedial and preventative conservation, storage and management of the Museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritagepreservation.org/PDFS/Capitalize.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124084158/http://heritagepreservation.org/PDFS/Capitalize.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China Central Television]] is a '''soft power of China'''. CCTV is a state-owned media organization and under supervised by SARPPFT. The organization and directors inside the media company are assigned by the government. The government control the news and supervised the directors in order to show their perspectives to the world.

== Soft Power ==
[[Soft power]], according to [[Joseph Nye]], who coined the term in his book in 1990: “ is the ability to get others to want the outcomes that you want, and the ability to achieve goals through attraction rather than coercion”(Nye, 1990). Indeed, soft power enables a change of behavior in others, without competition or conflict, by using persuasion and attraction. In this modern day, soft power becomes vital for a country. [[Mass media|Media industry]] plays an essential role among all the industries, and it’s the most influential power.

=== Introduction ===
China Central Television (CCTV) is a state-owned ministerial level institution of China, used to be called [[Beijing Television]] before 1978. China Central Television owns 50 television channels, and the broadcaster provides programming in six different languages. Among the 50 television channels, 16 of them are public while 21 are pay channels, and with 13 channels of foreign languages, which are English, French, Russian, Arabic as well as Spanish. It is one of the largest official mouthpieces of the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and under the supervision of [[State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television|State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film, and Television]] of the People’s Republic of China (SAPPRFT), a department within the State Council. State Council is the main department that supervising and censoring the whole China’s television industry. SAPPRFT is an executive branch under the State Council. Its main task is the administration and supervision of state-owned enterprise engaged in the television, radio and film industries. It performs the actual daily oversight, including censorship of sensitive content. Government related media organizations like CCTV, [[Xinhua News Agency]] and [[China National Radio]] must have permissions from SAPPRFT to broadcast the new content to the public.

In June 2017, CCTV "relaunched and rebranded its stable of foreign-language TV channels. The six are now labeled as [[China Global Television Network]] (CGTN) with CGTN English as its flagship channel. "&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/asia/cctv-international-channels-relaunch-cgtn-1201952228/|title=CCTV International Channels Relaunched as CGTN|last=Frater|first=Patrick|date=2017-01-04|work=Variety|access-date=2017-07-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Directors ===
The directors on CCTV also have positions in related government organizations and all of them are the members of Communist Party of China. Nie Chenxi, who is the main director of CCTV since 2015. He’s also the vice director of the [[Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China|Propaganda Department]] of the Communist Party of China (CPC), main director of SAPPRFT as well as the director of the National Copyright Administration of the People’s Republic of China. Nie was born in 1957 and from Hebei Province.  He worked for the local government since 1974. In the duration, he studied a master degree in management and engineering. In February 1993, He joined the Communist Party of China and worked towards to the CCP.  During Nie’s time, the government has issued repeated orders telling television channels to focus on “uplifting, patriotic programs and screen out ‘base and vulgar’ content” (Reuters, 2015). Historically, directors of CCTV made [[Cultural Revolution|cultural revolutions.]] In December 1991, Yang Weiguang was assigned as president of CCTV. With his peasant family background, it’s no doubt helped him secure a steady position in the government related broadcaster organizations. He left his CCTV post in 1999, and the ten years of his management of CCTV were considered as the best days. In Yang’s decade, CCTV was “unquestionably the network’s high point in terms of party approval, market position, and public sphere” (Zhu, 2012). It was the first decade of CCTV’s transformation from state-funded proselytizer to [[commercial broadcaster]].

=== Income ===
The main financial support to CCTV is from [[advertising]].  In 2013, CCTV earned a total of 15.88 billion Yuan, and increased its revenues 11.4% each year. The graph (Figure 2) showing the most of the advertisers is liquor companies. Within those companies, liquor company JNC Group had spent the most money on advertising. The company spent 608 million Yuan by placing their logo on four daily slots on the news bulletins for eight months. Other liquor companies like [[Kweichow Moutai Company|Kweichow Moutai Co]] and Wuliangye Group Co also are the main advertiser of CCTV. Kweichow Moutai Co spent 352 million Yuan on placing their advertising on CCTV before [[Xinwen Lianbo]] (National News broadcasting, which airing the CCTV news in local channel [[Xinwen Lianbo|everyday between 7pm to 7:30pm), and Wuliangye Group Co spent 499 million Yuan on the same time slots (C]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;hina Daily[[Xinwen Lianbo|, 2012). Those companies provided a steady financial support to CCTV. CCTV’s]] New Year[[Xinwen Lianbo|’s Gala is popular and attracted among the country, even internationally. CCTV’s New Year’s Gala is on Chinese New Year’s Eve and it’s a tradition that nearly every family in China participates in to ring in the New Year. The tickets of Gala doesn’t open for the public, but CCTV sen]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;nd invitations to some celebrities, such as people who hold a high post in the government, annually influenced people like [[Jack Ma]] ([[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Ali Baba (disambiguation)|Alibaba]]) as well as their family members. At the same time, CCTV will air the Gala on every local channel as well as in its foreign channels. People over the world will have a chance to watch this well-known performance. As a result, the advertisings during Gala are incredibly expensive but it still attracts a lot of companies to engage. CCTV also orients different kinds of event that open to the public, such as Skits, Xiangsheng, and Chinese Opera. (Mack, 2017), which tickets are available to the public. CCTV earns profits mainly through advertisements as well as its events.

=== Domestic Influence ===
China Central Television, [[China Radio International]] (CRI), [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua news agency]], and ''[[China Daily|The China Daily]]'' newspaper and website are the largest four state-owned media corporations. They all under control by SAPPRFT and rely on each other for producing news to the public. Xinhua News Agency is the main news source of CCTV. As they both are the official press agencies of the state, they have been tightly controlled and packaged by the government. In 2008, an [[earthquake]] [[List of earthquakes in China|measuring 8 on the Richter scale hit Sichuan Province]]. China Central Television was reporting on the disaster within minutes of the quake and had reporters airing with the updates within half an hour. “Domestic disaster of any sort were too hot to handle without instruction from the state and could harm the national image” (Zhu, 2012). This earthquake was a milestone of China as the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] was opened in a few months later in Beijing. In the chaos of the disaster, the Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China requested other Chinese news organizations not to broadcast their reports of the disaster, but instead only used information released by either CCTV or the Xinhua News Agency. This process reveals that the government controls the news.

=== International Policy ===
In 2001, a project called “Going Out” came up by president [[Jiang Zemin]] and launched by Xu Guangchun, who was the deputy head of the Propaganda Ministry and the head of SAPPRFT. This was a new start for CPC develop its power overseas. The project aims to bring China’s voice to the world. “Going Out” program was proposed to “land China’s TV and radio channels overseas within five years and provide multi languages and regionalized broadcasting and coverage by 2011” (Zhu, 2012). The image of China globally was misrepresent and misunderstand by other international medias like BBC, as result CPC wishes to erase its national image and present its voice to the world.

At the beginning of the “Going Out” Program CPC realized CCTV would meet some obstacles in western countries, because media organizations like [[CNN]] and [[BBC News|BBC]] are dominants in western world while CCTV is an Asian broadcaster. Besides, westerners have some kind of stereotyped opinions to Asian, especially to Chinese. It is not an easy job to change their perspective to Chinese, as a result China moved to Africa, where western medias did not cover too much. That’s why CCTV moved their attention to Africa in 2012. As Zhang mentioned that “the Africa-oriented ‘channel’ is a ‘testing ground’ for the construction of an expand state-centered Sino centric media discourse aimed at showcasing China’s soft power and challenging the perceived Western-centric world order” (Zhang, 2013). China understands that the Africans are facing the same problem, which is the misrepresenting image in the world, so it is much easier for CPC to bring the voice there. It is an essential as well as a significant step that push Chinese media steps to global.

'''Tiberius Cornelis Winkler''' (May 28, 1822 &amp;ndash; April 4, 1897) was a Dutch [[anatomist]], [[zoologist]] and [[natural history|natural historian]], and the second curator of [[geology]], [[paleontology]] and [[mineralogy]] at [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]].&lt;ref&gt;His successor in this role was [[Eugène Dubois]], who discovered ''Pithecanthropus'' ([[Java Man]], now considered a subspecies of ''[[Homo erectus]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; Besides translating the first edition of [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] ''[[Origin of Species]]'' (1860), he wrote a great number of works popularising science, particularly the life sciences.

==Early life==
Winkler was born in 1822, in the [[Friesland|Frisian]] capital of [[Leeuwarden]]. There, he attended primary school until his 12th or 13th year. His father subsequently arranged his apprenticeship to a grain merchant. He used his wages to educate himself in French, then German, and then English. This desire for self-education and self-discipline would characterise Winkler throughout his life.

He married in 1844 and began to study medicine in order to become a surgeon. In 1850, Winkler moved to [[Haarlem]] with his wife and four children, to begin his education at the local surgeons' college. He graduated two years later, and set up practice in [[Nieuwediep]]. His first [[patient]], a fisherman, complained of being stung by a [[Weever|weever fish]]. His studies took him to the library of [[Teylers Museum]] in Haarlem, and his subsequent article on the weever in the popular journal ''Album der Natuur'' established him as an expert on fishes.

==At Teylers==
At the Museum, he also developed an interest in [[paleontology]] and [[geology]]. The curator, professor [[Jacob Gijsbertus Samuël van Breda|Van Breda]], approached him to describe the [[fossil fish]]es from his own and Teylers' collections. This set Winkler up at the museum and his work, duly lauded, was published in the ''Verhandelingen'' ('Transactions') of Teylers' Society in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Veen, Joop C. van, "Tiberius Cornelis Winkler 100 jaar geleden overleden", in: ''Teylers Museum Magazijn'' '''7''' (2007), 9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up by further work on fishes from the German [[Solnhofen]] [[Solnhofen limestone|limestone]], and completion of the catalogue of the museum's fossil fish collection.

This achievement so impressed the Museum's directors that they approached Winkler to do the same for their other fossil and mineral collections. A year later he finished the catalogue, despite being forced to work in an unheated room and continuing with his general medical practice. In 1864 Winkler was asked to become curator of Teylers' paleontological and [[mineralogical]] cabinet, a post he kept until his death in 1897.

He immediately set to work to catalogue the Museum's entire collection of fossils, which at the time was unnumbered and, frequently, undocumented. On the advice of the prominent [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] [[natural history|natural historian]] [[Pieter Harting]], he applied a numerical system in which the fossils were divided into Periods ([[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] and [[Caenozoic]]) and sorted from 'high' to 'low'. This system, and the way in which Winkler applied it, already showed the influence of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin's]] theory of [[evolution]].

Completing this catalogue would take until 1896, by which time six volumes and five supplements had been published, documenting a total of 15,458 fossils.&lt;ref&gt;Veen, Joop C. van, "Tiberius Cornelis Winkler 100 jaar geleden overleden", in: ''Teylers Museum Magazijn'' '''7''' (2007), 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Winkler also catalogued the museum's [[mineral]] collection.

==Publications==
Winkler was very active as a populariser of science. He wrote more than a hundred articles, many of them aimed at educating the general public, much as he had educated himself. Many of these works appeared in ''Album der Natuur'' ('Album of Nature') and the proceedings of the Dutch Literature society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_vad003186501_01/_vad003186501_01_0039.php Palaeontological contribution] by Dr. T.C. Winkler on the fossils of the earth, 1865&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as importantly, Winkler translated numerous scientific works into [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Most famous among these was [[Charles Darwin]]'s seminal ''[[Origin of Species]]'', which appeared in Dutch one year after its English release in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[http://api.ning.com/files/aT0Fpi7QEAJXZty6RRr0*ayjT5aN-CLIR1HAnom7DRBt*Z64Ko2B*I88LPx*h2otwLvz5Vp*IKVqHQunTD*sItKN3P7MUMve/TeylerWinklerDarwin.doc  Teyler, Winkler, Darwin] Lecture by Marijn van Hoorn MA at the Congress of the European Botanical and Horticultural Libraries Group, Prague, April 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Winkler also proved himself to be a vocal defender of the theory of evolution, to the extent that he did not wish to question - unlike, at the time, Darwin himself - man's place in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Besselink, Marijke. "Winkler? Nooit van Gehoord", in: ''Teylers Museum Magazijn'' '''7''' (2007), 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Winkler was an active supporter of [[Volapük]], a [[constructed language]] invented by the Catholic priest [[Johann Martin Schleyer]].

In [[mathematical economics]], '''Topkis's theorem''' is a result that is useful for establishing [[comparative statics]].  The theorem allows researchers to understand how the optimal value for a choice variable changes when a feature of the environment changes.  The result states that if ''f'' is [[supermodular]] in (''x'',''θ''), and ''D'' is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]], then &lt;math&gt;x^*(\theta)=\arg\max_{x\in D}f(x,\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is nondecreasing in ''θ''.  The result is especially helpful for establishing comparative static results when the objective function is not differentiable.

==An example==
This example will show how using Topkis's theorem gives the same result as using more standard tools.  The advantage of using Topkis's theorem is that it can be applied to a wider class of problems than can be studied with standard economics tools.

A driver is driving down a highway and must choose a speed, ''s''. Going faster is desirable, but is more likely to result in a crash. There is some prevalence of potholes, ''p''.  The presence of potholes increases the probability of crashing.  Note that ''s'' is a choice variable and ''p'' is a parameter of the environment that is fixed from the perspective of the driver.  The driver seeks to &lt;math&gt;\max_{s}U(s,p)&lt;/math&gt;.

We would like to understand how the driver's speed (a choice variable) changes with the amount of potholes: 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial s^{\ast }(p)}{\partial p}.&lt;/math&gt;

If one wanted to solve the problem with standard tools such as the [[implicit function theorem]], one would have to assume that the problem is well behaved: ''U''(.) is twice continuously differentiable, concave in ''s'', that the domain over which ''s'' is defined is convex, and that it there is a unique maximizer &lt;math&gt;s^{\ast }(p)&lt;/math&gt; for every value of ''p'' and that &lt;math&gt;s^{\ast }(p)&lt;/math&gt; is in the interior of the set over which ''s'' is defined.  Note that the optimal speed is a function of the amount of potholes.  Taking the first order condition, we know that at the optimum, &lt;math&gt;U_{s}(s^{\ast }(p),p)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Differentiating the first order condition, with respect to ''p'' and using the implicit function theorem, we find that
: &lt;math&gt;U_{ss}(s^{\ast}(p),p)(\partial s^{\ast }(p)/(\partial p))+U_{sp}(s^{\ast }(p),p)=0&lt;/math&gt; 
or that 

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial s^{\ast }(p)}{\partial p}
 = \underset{\text{negative since we assumed }U(.)\text{ was concave in }s}{\underbrace{\frac{-U_{sp}(s^{\ast }(p),p)}{U_{ss}(s^{\ast }(p),p)}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

So, 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial s^{\ast }(p)}{\partial p}\overset{\text{sign}}{=}U_{sp}(s^{\ast }(p),p). &lt;/math&gt;

If ''s'' and ''p'' are substitutes, 

:&lt;math&gt;U_{sp}(s^\ast (p),p)&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; 

and hence 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial s^{\ast }(p)}{\partial p}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;

and more potholes causes less speeding.  Clearly it is more reasonable to assume that they are substitutes.

The problem with the above approach is that it relies on the differentiability of the objective function and on concavity.  We could get at the same answer using Topkis's theorem in the following way.  We want to show that &lt;math&gt;U(s,p)&lt;/math&gt; is submodular (the opposite of supermodular) in &lt;math&gt;\left( s,p\right) &lt;/math&gt;.  Note that the choice set is clearly a lattice.  The cross partial of ''U'' being negative, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial s\,\partial p}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, is a sufficient condition.  Hence if &lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial s\,\partial p}&lt;0,&lt;/math&gt; we know that &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial s^{\ast }(p)}{\partial p}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence using the [[implicit function theorem]] and Topkis's theorem gives the same result, but the latter does so with fewer assumptions.

The '''Tubbs Cordage Company Office Building''' is a small frame structure located in [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]], in the [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf district]] of [[San Francisco, California]].

==History==
The 1890 structure was originally located at the Tubbs Cordage factory, at 611-613 Front Street, San Francisco. It was moved to Hyde Street Pier for display and preservation in 1963, and moved again in 1990.

The Tubbs Cordage Company Office is of local historical significance in the category of industry due to its association with the Tubbs Cordage Company and its rope factory founded in San Francisco by [[Alfred L. Tubbs]] and his brother Hiram where the first commercial manufacture of rope on the Pacific Coast was accomplished.

==Description==
The office is a small, single-story, single-room office building (with the addition, after the historic period, of a small closet, with a sink and toilet, as well as an office cubicle). The exterior is painted a dark brownish-red, common on industrial buildings in the last century, and sometimes referred to as "mineral" red or "iron" red, with white trim. This was the color scheme of the office at the time of its move to Hyde Street Pier. The structure stands by itself at the pier, just as it did on the original site.

Rectangular in shape, the building dimensions are 21 by 26 feet. There is no basement, and the structure rests upon redwood sills. One story high, the building is framed with redwood siding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hscl.cr.nps.gov/insidenps/report.asp?STATE=CA&amp;PARK=SAFR&amp;STRUCTURE=&amp;SORT=&amp;RECORDNO=10|date=2008-11-17|work=List of Classified Structures|title=Tubbs Cordage Company Office Building|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Tubbs Cordage Company Office Building|url={{NRHP url|id=79000254}} |format=pdf|date=October 6, 1979 |author=James P.

[[File:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''The [[Sermon on the Mount]]'', where Jesus warns of the [[false prophet]]s who are to come, by [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]], 19th century.]]

This article lists '''unfulfilled Christian religious predictions''' that failed to come about in the specified time frame, listed by religious group.

==Adventism, Millerism==
[[Adventism]] has its roots in the teachings of a [[Baptist]] preacher by the name of [[William Miller (preacher)|William Miller]]. He first predicted the [[Second Advent]] of Jesus Christ would occur before March 21, 1844.&lt;ref&gt;William to Joshua V. Himes, February 4, 1844.&lt;/ref&gt; When this date passed a new date was predicted, April 18, 1844.&lt;ref&gt;George R. Knight, ''Millennial Fever and the End of the World'', Boise, ID: Pacific Press, 1993, 163-164.&lt;/ref&gt; Again the date passed and another Millerite, [[Samuel S. Snow]], derived the date of October 22, 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel S. Snow, ''The Advent Herald'', August 21, 1844, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The non-fulfillment of these predictions has been named the [[Millerism|Millerite]] [[Great Disappointment]].

== Anabaptist Church ==
Certain [[Anabaptists]] of the early 16th century believed that the [[Millennialism|Millennium]] would occur in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;''When Prophecy Fails, Festinger'', Riecken and Schaeter, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; Another source reports: "When the prophecy failed, the Anabaptists became more zealous and claimed that two witnesses (Enoch and Elijah) had come in the form of [[Jan Matthys]] and [[Jan Bockelson]]; they would set up the [[New Jerusalem]] in [[Münster]]. Münster became a frightening dictatorship under Bockelson's control. Although all Lutherans and Catholics were expelled from that city, the millennium never came."&lt;ref&gt;''Soothsayers Of The Second Advent'', William Alnor, page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anglican Church ==
In volume II of ''The Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers'', author Leroy Edwin Froom tells us about a prominent [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] prelate, who made a relevant prediction: "[[Edwin Sandys (archbishop)|Edwin Sandys]] (1519–1588), [[Archbishop of York]] and [[Primate of England]] was born in Lancashire... Sandys says, 'Now, as we know not the day and time, so let us be assured that this coming of the Lord is near. He is not slack, as we do count slackness. That it is at hand, it may be probably gathered out of the [[Scriptures]] in diverse places. The signs mentioned by Christ in the Gospel which should be the foreshewers of this terrible day, are almost all fulfilled.'"&lt;ref&gt;''The Prophetic Faith of our Fathers'', pages 417, 419.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assemblies of God Church ==
During [[World War I]], ''The Weekly Evangel'', an official publication of the [[Assemblies of God]], carried this prediction: "We are not yet in the [[Armageddon]] struggle proper, but at its commencement, and it may be, if students of prophecy read the signs aright, that Christ will come before the present war closes, and before Armageddon...The war preliminary to Armageddon, it seems, has commenced."&lt;ref&gt;April 10, 1917 edition, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; Other editions speculated that the end would come no later than 1934 or 1935.&lt;ref&gt;May 13, 1916 pp 6–9 etc&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calvary Chapel ==
The founder of the [[Calvary Chapel]] system, [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], published the book ''End Times'' in 1979. On the jacket of his book, Smith is called a "well known Bible scholar and prophecy teacher." In this book he wrote:

{{quote|1=As we look at the world scene today, it would appear that the coming of the Lord is very, very, close. Yet, we do not know when it will be. It could be that the Lord will wait for a time longer. If I understand Scripture correctly, Jesus taught us that the generation which sees the 'budding of the fig tree', the birth of the nation Israel, will be the generation that sees the Lord's return; I believe that the generation of 1948 is the last generation. Since a generation of judgment is forty years and the tribulation lasts seven years, I believe the Lord could come back for his church anytime before the tribulation starts, which would mean anytime before 1981. (1948&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;40&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1981) However, it is possible that Jesus is dating the beginning of the generation from 1967, when Jerusalem was again under Israeli control for the first time since 587 BC. We don't know for sure which year actually marks the beginning of the last generation.&lt;ref&gt;"End Times" by Chuck Smith. 1979. Pages 35, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This same viewpoint was published by the popular pastor [[Hal Lindsey]] in his widely published book ''[[The Late Great Planet Earth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;see page 43&lt;/ref&gt;

== Irvingism ==
The well known Scottish cleric, [[Edward Irving]], was the forerunner of the [[Catholic Apostolic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Flegg, C.G. Gathered under Apostles. 1992. Oxford University Press {{ISBN|978-0198263357}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828 he wrote a work headed ''The Last Days: A Discourse on the Evil Character of These Our Times, Proving Them to be the 'Perilous Times' and the 'Last Days'''. On pages 10–22 we find some telling information which includes the following:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B9IHAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=%22will+begin+to+run+from+the+time+of+God's+appearing+for+his+ancient+people%22&amp;lr=&amp;num=100&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22will%20begin%20to%20run%20from%20the%20time%20of%20God's%20appearing%20for%20his%20ancient%20people%22&amp;f=false Edward Irving, ''The last days: a discourse on the evil character of these our times, providing them to be the "perilous times" of the "last days"'', J Nisbet Pub., 1850 pp.10–22]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I conclude, therefore, that the last days... will begin to run from the time of God's appearing for his ancient people, and gathering them together to the work of destroying all Antichristian nations, of evangelising the world, and of governing it during the Millennium... The times and fullness of the times, so often mentioned in the New Testament, I consider as referring to the great period numbered by times...Now if this reasoning be correct, as there can be little doubt that the one thousand two hundred and sixty days concluded in the year 1792, and the thirty additional days in the year 1823, we are already entered upon the last days, and the ordinary life of a man will carry many of us to the end of them. If this be so, it gives to the subject with which we have introduced this year's ministry a very great importance indeed.}}

{{Main|Watch Tower Society unfulfilled predictions}}

[[Charles Taze Russell]], the first president of the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]], calculated 1874 as the year of Christ's [[Second Coming]], and taught that Christ was invisibly present and ruling from the heavens since that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3404705638.html|title=Charles Taze Russell facts, information, pictures - Encyclopedia.com articles about Charles Taze Russell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The writer, among many others now interested, was sound asleep, in profound ignorance of the cry, etc., until 1876, when being awakened he trimmed his lamp (for it is still very early in the morning.)

And the time of trouble, conquest of the nations, and events connected with the day of wrath, have only ample time, during the balance of this forty years, for their fulfillment." ''The Three Worlds'', p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; 1874 was considered the end of 6,000 years of human history and the beginning of judgment by Christ.&lt;ref&gt;In 1935, the idea that the 6,000 years ran out in 1874 was moved forward 100 years. {{cite journal|journal=The Golden Age|title=The Second Hand in the Timepiece of God|pages=412–413|date=March 27, 1935|url=http://www.a2z.org/wtarchive/docs/1935_Calendar_Golden_Age.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021839/http://www.a2z.org/wtarchive/docs/1935_Calendar_Golden_Age.pdf|archivedate=September 28, 2007|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1917 Watch Tower Society publication predicted that in 1918, God would begin to destroy churches and millions of their members.&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in the Scriptures'', Vol. 7, 1917, p. 485, "In the year 1918, when God destroys the churches wholesale and the church members by the millions, it shall be that any that escape shall come to the works of Pastor Russell."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Franklin Rutherford|J.F. Rutherford]], who succeeded Russell as president of the Watch Tower Society, predicted that the [[Millennialism|Millennium]] would begin in 1925, and that biblical figures such as [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], [[Jacob]] and [[David]] would be resurrected as "princes". The Watch Tower Society bought property and built a house, [[Beth Sarim]], in California for their return.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', May 15, 1922; Sep. 1, 1922; Apr. 1, 1923; Millions Now Living Will Never Die, 1925, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1966, statements in Jehovah's Witness publications raised strong expectations that Armageddon could arrive in 1975. In 1974 Witnesses were commended for selling their homes and property to "finish out the rest of their days in this old system" in full-time preaching.&lt;ref&gt;''Kingdom Ministry'', Watch Tower Society, May 1974, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 ''The Watchtower'' advised those who had been "disappointed" by unfulfilled expectations for 1975 to adjust their viewpoint because that understanding was "based on wrong premises".&lt;ref&gt;"A Solid Basis for Confidence", ''Watchtower'', July 15, 1976, page 441.&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, the Watch Tower Society admitted its responsibility in building up hope regarding 1975.&lt;ref&gt;''The Watchtower'', March 15, 1980, p.17 "With the appearance of the book ''Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God'', ... considerable expectation was aroused regarding the year 1975. ... there were other statements published that implied that such realization of hopes by that year was more of a probability than a mere possibility. It is to be regretted that these latter statements apparently overshadowed the cautionary ones and contributed to a buildup of the expectation already initiated. ... ''persons having to do with the publication of the information'' ... contributed to the buildup of hopes centered on that date."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lutheran Church ==
The founder of the [[Lutheran Church]] was the reformer, [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546 A.D.). According to one authority, Luther ventured to predict: "For my part, I am sure that the Day of Judgement is just around the corner. It doesn't matter that we don't know the precise day... perhaps someone else can figure it out. But it is certain that time is now at an end."&lt;ref&gt;''Reformation Principles and Practice: Essays in Honor of Arthur Geoffrey Dickens'', p 169&lt;/ref&gt; Another author says: "In all of [Luther's] work there was a sense of urgency for the time was short... the world was heading for Armageddon in the war with the Turk."&lt;ref&gt;''Luther's View of Church History'', John M. Headley, Yale University Press, 1963, pp 13,14&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after Luther's death in 1546, Lutheran leaders kept up the claim of the nearness of the end. About the year 1584, a zealous Lutheran named Adam Nachenmoser wrote the large volume '[Prognosticum Theologicum]' in which he predicted: ''"In 1590 the [[Gospel]] would be preached to all nations and a wonderful unity would be achieved. The last days would then be close at hand."'' Nachenmoser offered numerous conjectures about the date; 1635 seemed most likely.&lt;ref&gt;''Prophecy and Gnosis — Apocalypticism in the Wake of the Lutheran [[Protestant Reformation]]'', Robin Bruce Barnes, p 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] issued a study in 1989 refuting any end times claim, declaring that "repeatedly taught by Jesus and the apostles is the truth that the exact hour of Christ's coming remains hidden in the secret counsels of God (Matt. 24:36)."&lt;ref&gt;The "End Times": A Study on Eschatology and Millennialism. A Report of the Commission on Theology and Church Relations of The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. September 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mormonism==
{{Main|List of prophecies of Joseph Smith}}
[[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Mormon]] faith, made several dozen prophecies during his lifetime, many of which are recorded in the sacred texts of the Mormon faith. The prophecies included predictions of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the coming of Jesus, and several less significant predictions. Church [[apologist]]s cite prophecies that they claim came true,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.fairmormon.org/Joseph_Smith/Alleged_false_prophecies|title=Joseph Smith/Alleged false prophecies|publisher=|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and church critics cite prophecies that they claim did not come true.&lt;ref&gt;

Montanus, who founded the [[Montanist]] movement in 156 AD, predicted that Jesus would return during the lifetime of the group's founding members.&lt;ref name=pga&gt;{{cite book|title=Pocket Guide to the Apocalypse: The Official Field Manual for the End of the World|last=Boyett|first=Jason|year=2005|publisher=Relevant Media Group|location=|isbn=978-0-9760357-1-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M0OoQkcx8ykC#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 22, 2011 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presbyterian Church ==
[[Thomas Brightman]], who lived from 1562 to 1607, has been called "one of the fathers of [[Presbyterianism]] in England." He predicted that "between 1650 and 1695 [we] would see the conversion of the many Jews and a revival of their [[nation]] in Palestine...the destruction of the Papacy...the marriage of the Lamb and his wife."&lt;ref&gt;''A Great Expectation — Eschatological Thought in English Protestantism to 1660'' by [[Bryan W. Ball]] and E.J. Brill, page 117&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Love]] who lived from 1618–1651 was a bright graduate of Oxford and a strong Presbyterian. Love predicted that: (1) Babylon would fall in 1758 (2) God's anger against the wicked would be demonstrated in 1759 and (3) in 1763 there would occur a great earthquake all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;''The Logic of Millennial Thought'' by James West Davidson, page 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Catholic Church==
When in 1525 [[Martin Luther]], an ex-monk, married [[Katharina von Bora]], an ex-nun, his enemies{{who|date=December 2012}} said that their offspring would fulfill an old tradition that the [[Antichrist]] would be the son of such a union. The [[Catholic]] scholar and theologian [[Erasmus]] remarked that the tradition could apply to thousands of such children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/history/7_ch05.htm Philip Schaff, ''History of the Christian Church'', vol. 7, chapter 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United States v. Keenan''''' was a court case in the United States where the accused (Keenan) was found guilty of murder after he obeyed an order to shoot and kill an elderly [[Vietnam]]ese citizen. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces|Court of Military Appeals]] held that "the justification for acts done pursuant to orders does not exist if the order was of such a nature that a man of ordinary sense and understanding would know it to be illegal." The soldier who gave Keenan the order, Corporal Luczko, was acquitted by reason of insanity.

{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[List of thermodynamic properties|System properties]]}}
In [[thermodynamics]], the '''volume''' of a [[thermodynamic system|system]] is an important [[extensive parameter]] for describing its [[thermodynamic state]]. The '''specific volume''', an [[intensive property]], is the system's volume per unit of mass. Volume is a [[function of state]] and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as [[pressure]] and [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]]. For example, volume is related to the [[pressure]] and [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] of an [[ideal gas]] by the [[ideal gas law]].

The physical volume of a system may or may not coincide with a [[control volume]] used to analyze the system.

==Overview==
The volume of a thermodynamic system typically refers to the volume of the working fluid, such as, for example, the fluid within a piston. Changes to this volume may be made through an application of [[work (thermodynamics)|work]], or may be used to produce work.  An [[isochoric process]] however operates at a constant-volume, thus no work can be produced. Many other [[thermodynamic process]]es will result in a change in volume. A [[polytropic process]], in particular, causes changes to the system so that the quantity &lt;math&gt;pV^n&lt;/math&gt; is constant (where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is pressure, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is volume, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[polytropic index]], a constant). Note that for specific polytropic indexes a polytropic process will be equivalent to a constant-property process. For instance, for very large values of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; approaching infinity, the process becomes constant-volume.

Gases are [[compressible]], thus their volumes (and specific volumes) may be subject to change during thermodynamic processes. Liquids, however, are nearly incompressible, thus their volumes can be often taken as constant. In general, [[compressibility]] is defined as the relative volume change of a fluid or solid as a response to a pressure, and may be determined for substances in any phase. Similarly, [[thermal expansion]] is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in temperature.

Many [[thermodynamic cycle]]s are made up of varying processes, some which maintain a constant volume and some which do not. A [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle, for example, follows a sequence where the refrigerant fluid transitions between the liquid and vapor [[states of matter]].

Typical units for volume are &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{m^3}&lt;/math&gt; (cubic [[meter]]s), &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{l}&lt;/math&gt; ([[liter]]s), and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ft}^3&lt;/math&gt; (cubic [[foot (unit)|feet]]).

==Heat and work==
{{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}Mechanical work performed on a working fluid causes a change in the mechanical constraints of the system; in other words, for work to occur, the volume must be altered.  Hence volume is an important parameter in characterizing many thermodynamic processes where an exchange of energy in the form of work is involved.

Volume is one of a pair of [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate variable]]s, the other being pressure.  As with all conjugate pairs, the product is a form of energy.  The product &lt;math&gt;pV&lt;/math&gt; is the energy lost to a system due to mechanical work.  This product is one term which makes up [[enthalpy]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;H = U + pV,\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the [[internal energy]] of the system.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] describes constraints on the amount of useful work which can be extracted from a thermodynamic system. In thermodynamic systems where the temperature and volume are held constant, the measure of "useful" work attainable is the [[Helmholtz free energy]]; and in systems where the volume is not held constant, the measure of useful work attainable is the [[Gibbs free energy]].

Similarly, the appropriate value of [[heat capacity]] to use in a given process depends on whether the process produces a change in volume. The heat capacity is a function of the amount of heat added to a system.  In the case of a constant-volume process, all the heat affects the [[internal energy]] of the system (i.e., there is no pV-work, and all the heat affects the temperature). However, in a process without a constant volume, the heat addition affects both the internal energy and the work (i.e., the enthalpy); thus the temperature changes by a different amount than in the constant-volume case and a different heat capacity value is required.

==Specific volume==
{{see also|Specific volume#Specific volume|l1=Specific volume}}
[[Specific volume]] (&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;) is the volume occupied by a unit of mass of a material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Cengel | first1 = Yunus A. | last2 = Boles | first2 = Michael A. | title = Thermodynamics: an engineering approach | year = 2002 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = Boston  | isbn  = 0-07-238332-1 | pages =    11}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases the specific volume is a useful quantity to determine because, as an intensive property, it can be used to determine the complete state of a system in conjunction with [[state postulate|another independent intensive variable]]. The specific volume also allows systems to be studied without reference to an exact operating volume, which may not be known (nor significant) at some stages of analysis.

The specific volume of a substance is equal to the reciprocal of its [[mass density]]. Specific volume may be expressed in &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{m^3}}{\mathrm{kg}} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{ft^3}}{\mathrm{lb}} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{ft^3}}{\mathrm{slug}} &lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{mL}}{\mathrm{g}} &lt;/math&gt; .
:&lt;math&gt; \nu = \frac{V}{m} = \frac{1}{\rho} &lt;/math&gt;

where, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the material.

For an [[ideal gas]],
:&lt;math&gt;\nu = \frac{{\bar{R}}  T}{P}&lt;/math&gt;
where, &lt;math&gt;{\bar{R}} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific gas constant]], &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure of the gas.

Specific volume may also refer to [[molar volume]].

==Gas volume==

===Dependence on pressure and temperature===
The volume of gas increases proportionally to [[absolute temperature]] and decreases inversely proportionally to [[pressure]], approximately according to the [[ideal gas law]]:

&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{nRT}{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:* ''p'' is the pressure
:* ''V'' is the volume
:* ''n'' is the [[amount of substance]] of gas (moles)
:* ''R'' is the [[gas constant]], 8.314 [[joule|J]]·[[kelvin|K]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[[mole (unit)|mol]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
:* ''T'' is the [[absolute temperature]]

To simplify, a volume of gas may be expressed as the volume it would have in [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]], which are 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 100 kPa.&lt;ref name="IUPAC"&gt;{{cite book |author= A. D. McNaught, A. Wilkinson |title=Compendium of Chemical Terminology, The Gold Book |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/goldbook/S05910.html |edition=2nd |year=1997 |publisher=Blackwell Science |isbn=0-86542-684-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humidity exclusion ===
In contrast to other gas components, water content in air, or [[humidity]], to a higher degree depends on vaporization and condensation from or into water, which, in turn, mainly depends on temperature. Therefore, when applying more pressure to a gas saturated with water, all components will initially decrease in volume approximately according to the ideal gas law. However, some of the water will condense until returning to almost the same humidity as before, giving the resulting total volume deviating from what the ideal gas law predicted. Conversely, decreasing temperature would also make some water condense, again making the final volume deviating from predicted by the ideal gas law.

Therefore, gas volume may alternatively be expressed excluding the humidity content: ''V''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; (volume dry). This fraction more accurately follows the ideal gas law. On the contrary ''V''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (volume saturated) is the volume a gas mixture would have if humidity was added to it until saturation (or 100% [[relative humidity]]).

=== General conversion ===
To compare gas volume between two conditions of different temperature or pressure (1 and 2), assuming nR are the same, the following equation uses humidity exclusion in addition to the ideal gas law:

&lt;math&gt; V_2 = V_1 \times \frac{T_2}{T_1} \times \frac{p_1-p_{w,1}}{p_2-p_{w,2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where, in addition to terms used in the ideal gas law:
:* ''p&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the partial pressure of gaseous water during condition 1 and 2, respectively

For example, calculating how much 1 liter of air (a) at 0&amp;nbsp;°C, 100 kPa, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 kPa (known as STPD, see below) would fill when breathed into the lungs where it is mixed with water vapor (l), where it quickly becomes 37&amp;nbsp;°C, 100 kPa, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.2 kPa (BTPS):

&lt;math&gt; V_{l} = 1\ \mathrm{l} \times \frac{310\ \mathrm{K}}{273\ \mathrm{K}} \times \frac{100\ \mathrm{kPa}-0\ \mathrm{kPa}}{100\ \mathrm{kPa}-6.2\ \mathrm{kPa}} = 1.21\ \mathrm{l} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Common conditions ===
Some common expressions of gas volume with defined or variable temperature, pressure and humidity inclusion are:
*'''ATPS''': Ambient temperature (variable) and pressure (variable), saturated (humidity depends on temperature)
*'''ATPD''': Ambient temperature (variable) and pressure (variable), dry (no humidity)
*'''BTPS''': Body Temperature (37&amp;nbsp;°C or 310 K) and pressure (generally same as ambient), saturated (47 mmHg or 6.2 kPa)
*'''STPD''': [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure|Standard temperature (0 °C or 273 K) and pressure ({{convert|760|mmHg|kPa|2|abbr=on}} or {{convert|100|kPa|mmHg|2|abbr=on}}&lt;!--was written as if they were the same, but they are not--&gt;)]], dry (no humidity)

===Conversion factors===
The following conversion factors can be used to convert between expressions for volume of a gas:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Stanley|title=Exercise Physiology: Basis of Human Movement in Health and Disease|year=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=0-7817-3592-0|page=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1b0iwv8-jGcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA113,M1 |author2=Miller, Wayne |author3=Eason, M|accessdate=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial volume===
{{see also|Partial pressure#Partial volume|l1=Partial pressure}}
The partial volume of a particular gas is the volume which the gas would have if it alone occupied the volume, with unchanged pressure and temperature, and is useful in gas mixtures, e.g. air, to focus on one particular gas component, e.g. oxygen.

It can be approximated both from partial pressure and molar fraction:&lt;ref name=biophysics200&gt;Page   200 in: Medical biophysics. Flemming Cornelius. 6th Edition, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
