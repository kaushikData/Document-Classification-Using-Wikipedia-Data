{{Argentine economic crisis}}

'''''Apagón''''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], literally, ''[[Power blackout|blackout]]'') is a form of [[protest]] that was employed several times in some large [[cities in Argentina|cities]] of [[Argentina]], during the [[Argentine economic crisis|economic crisis]] at the beginning of the 2000s. The justification for a blackout as a form of protest was a rejection of the proposed increase of fees of electricity and other basic services.

== in Argentina ==
During the 1990s, under the [[Carlos Menem|Menem]] administration, the Convertibility Law guaranteed a [[fixed exchange rate]] of 1 [[United States dollar|U. S. dollar]] per [[Argentine peso]], and the private companies that supplied [[electric power]], [[telephone]] service, [[natural gas]] and [[drinking water]], among others, earned consistently high [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], which could be turned into dollars and sent abroad with no loss. A number of these service providers had also secured dollarized fees, contracts that entitled them to ask for increases in their fees subject to the [[inflation]] of the [[United States]], and other provisions of the kind.

After the uncontrolled [[devaluation]] of the peso in 2002, the profit measured in dollars was diminished proportionally, and their local operating costs in pesos skyrocketed. The service companies asked the national government of Argentina to authorize considerable fee increases (in some cases over 100%). The [[Eduardo Duhalde|Duhalde]] administration rejected the possibility for a while, but finally called for consultation meetings to discuss the matter.

The public reacted angrily to this, accusing the private companies of being greedy and oblivious to the dangerously unstable social environment: half of the population was under the [[poverty line]], [[unemployment]] was over 20%, and inflation continued rising. On September 19, 2002, political activists and organizations ([[Elisa Carrió]]'s ''ARI'', other [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] parties, [[piquetero]]s, the ''Central de Trabajadores Argentinos'', neighbourhood assemblies, etc.) gathered in [[Plaza de Mayo]] and called for a widespread intentional "blackout".

On September 24, between 8 and 8.15 p.m., in [[Buenos Aires]] and some other large cities, people turned off the lights in their houses and apartments. Many businesses closed their doors and also diminished the lights. In the streets, drivers honked their horns, and there were isolated [[cacerolazo]]s. The Legislative building of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires turned off the illumination of its facade.

The actual strength of the blackout was relatively minor, and even then it was mostly concentrated in Buenos Aires, but the combination of the protests was marked by the media. The government postponed the renegotiation of public service fees indefinitely.

== in Spain ==
In Spain, since November 2011 there is also a campaign named [https://web.archive.org/web/20111224015200/https://n-1.cc/pg/groups/856699/apagn-yo-ya-no-pago-mas-por-la-electricidad-sucia/ A-pagón: No pagues centrales nucleares y de carbón] (A-pagón: Don't pay for nuclear and coal-fired power stations) related to the avoiding of the augmentative term "pagón" which could be translated as "big payer". The campaign's idea is "Don't pay for electricity until it is produced by 100%-renewable-and-clean methods".

The activists of this campaign argue that "If you don't pay electricity until it would be clean, all the electricity company can do is to disconnect you for a minute, which is the time you need to reconnect it", and also states that "You must maintain always the meter count: in this way the dirty company knows the money it has not incoming, due to using dirty means to produce the electricity".

'''''Avion Pirata''''' ('''Pirate Airplane''') is the name given by [[Bolivia]]ns to a [[Lockheed Constellation]] which mysteriously carried flights into [[El Trompillo Airport]] in [[Santa Cruz, Bolivia]], during 1961. The airplane has remained in Bolivia since 1961, when it was forced to land by the [[Bolivian Air Force]] after a chase in which an Air Force Captain died in a crash.

The airplane has become a tourist attraction, having undergone several changes of ownership, and has also become an [[urban legend]] among Bolivians.

==The airplane==
The airplane is a Lockheed Constellation with the registration N2520B, which at the time of the incident was registered to [[Lloyd Airlines]] of [[Miami, Florida]] (not to be confused with [[Lloyd Aereo Boliviano]], the then flag-carrier of Bolivia). According to AeroTransport Data Bank the airplane was sold to a Brandon Anderson in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerotransport.org/php/go.php AeroTransport Data Bank]&lt;/ref&gt; The airplane had previously flown for [[Braniff International Airways]] and [[Trans American Airlines]] before being acquired by the Empire Supply Company in 1960, months before the incident happened. A [[model airplane]] of this aircraft exists, as [[Corgi Toys]] released a model of the Constellation under Braniff [[livery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/23269353@N00/8203891668/ |title=Corgi Braniff L-049 Constellation (N2520B) &amp;#124; Flickr - Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date=2012-11-18 |accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The fateful flight==
During some time before N2520B's final flight, Constellations had been conducting night flights to El Trompillo Airport. Locals believe that these transported goods to [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]] and [[Arica, Chile]], among other destinations, from the United States, such as cigarettes, textiles, whiskey, socks, television sets and [[contraband]] items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldeber.com.bo/vernotacolumnistas.php?id=121024220952 |title=Desalojo del avión pirata |publisher=Eldeber.com.bo |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228043014/http://www.eldeber.com.bo/vernotacolumnistas.php?id=121024220952 |archivedate=2014-02-28 |df= }} (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

On Saturday, 29 July 1961, the airplane landed at El Trompillo Airport, and rested there until 30 July, when it took off southward. The plane's occupants had not filed a flight plan; instead they said they were carrying a practice-only flight. Immediately after take-off, Trompillo control tower alerted the [[Fuerza Aerea Boliviana]], which sent [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]] fighters to chase it. The P-51 pilots and the control tower asked the plane's crew to fly to [[Cochabamba]], but the crew ignored the request.

The P-51s then proceeded to shoot at the airplane, making the Constellation crew attempt an emergency landing at El Trompillo Airport. As the aircraft descended, the crew dived in a final attempt at getting the P-51's to call off their pursuit, causing one pilot, Captain Alberto Peredo Céspedes, to crash fatally. The Constellation itself landed at El Trompillo, and the crew members were arrested on site. The aircraft's tires were blown up and the local military airline, [[Transporte Aereo Militar|TAM]], flew soldiers in from Cochabamba to prevent the airport from being overtaken by guerrillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldia.com.bo/index.php?cat=386&amp;pla=3&amp;id_articulo=97260 |title=Aterriza el olvido al 'Avión Pirata' |publisher=Eldia.com.bo |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10}} (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crew trial==
Following the incident, Bolivian President [[Victor Paz Estenssoro]], ordered an investigation which yielded the arrest of 85 soldiers and [[dishonorable discharge]] of 130 more. Also arrested were pilots William Roy Robinson and William Friedman, co-pilot Salvatore Henrique Romano, flight engineer Bertrand Vinson and radio-man Gene Hawkins. The case and its investigation became known nationally in Bolivia as the ''caso Constellation''.

The four Americans and one Brazilian (Henrique Romano) were charged with homicide, piracy, violation of international laws and contraband. After being incarcerated at [[Panoptico de La Paz]] jail, three of them were given provisional freedom and two were admitted into a local hospital under the supervision of American vice-consul in Bolivia at the time, [[Samuel Karp]].

In November 1961, it was announced that the airplane's crew had escaped Bolivia. They were [[Trial in absentia|tried ''in absentia'']], and in 1967, the case's prosecutor asked for ten years of prison for each crew-member. Ultimately, none of the five men on the airplane returned to Bolivia and four of them remain at large.

Pilot William Roy Robinson died on 1 April 2010, aged 90, and is buried in the family cemetery, San Mateo, Florida.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

==Airplane's fate==
On 25 August 1961, a local judge assigned a Bolivian Air Force Commander as keeper of the airplane and the contents that it had during its last flight, as compensation for the P-51 lost during the plane's chase. But the La Paz district's customs department prevented this from actually taking place, and the plane became the property of the FAB's Military Aviation College instead. In 1979, the airplane was moved to Boris Banzer Prada Park at Uruguay avenue in Santa Cruz from El Trompillo airport, as it was given to Santa Cruz's city hall, which decided to place it at barrio El Tao, where the park is located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Publicado por MSCD |url=http://utilinformacion.blogspot.com/2011/01/santa-cruz-de-la-sierra-450-anos-de.html |title=Informacion Util ?: Santa Cruz de la Sierra &amp;#124; 450 años de fundación .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4894">The '''Baskerville effect''', or the '''Hound of the Baskervilles effect''' is the discredited idea that there is an increase in rate of mortality through [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s on days considered unlucky because of the psychological stress this causes on superstitious people.  The term derives from the [[Sherlock Holmes]] [[novel]] ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' in which a hellish-looking dog chases Sir Charles Baskerville, sufferer of a chronic heart disease. According to legend, the dog cursed his family, Baskerville runs in great fear and dies of a heart attack "with an expression of horror in his face".

==Origin of the term==
The Baskerville effect was named by David Phillips and his colleagues at the [[University of California, San Diego]], on a paper where they reported that the daily number of deaths of [[Chinese Americans|Chinese]] and [[Japanese Americans]] from heart attacks between 1973 and 1998 was 7% higher on the fourth of the month compared to the average for the other days in that month, while this was not observed in the general American population.&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=David P|title=The Hound of the Baskervilles effect: natural experiment on the influence of psychological stress on timing of death|journal=BMJ|date=22 December 2001|pmc=61045|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four (四, formal writing: 肆, [[pinyin]] si4) is considered an [[unlucky number]] in [[Chinese culture|Chinese]], and hence in the [[Culture of Japan|Japanese]] and [[Korean culture|Korean]], because it sounds like "death" (死 [[pinyin]] si3).  Some Chinese and Japanese [[hotel]]s and hospitals do not use it as a room number. The authors, seeing how telephone line subscribers could choose the last four digits in their telephone numbers, found evidence that the number 4 is avoided among Chinese and Japanese Americans by searching the California Yellow Pages for telephone numbers of Chinese and Japanese restaurants, and finding that these had significantly fewer numbers 4 in this last section (366 out of 4748, or 7.71%) than it would be expected by chance (10%), a pattern not observed on restaurants listed as American.&lt;ref name="phillips" /&gt;

Their hypothesis was that the peak was caused by stress induced by the [[superstition]] surrounding this number.&lt;ref name="phillips" /&gt;

==Criticism, attempted replication and refutation==
In 2002, [[Gary Smith (economist)|Gary Smith]] commented that Phillips and colleagues had omitted data from several heart disease categories, picking only those that happened to have a higher rate on the fourth day, calling them "chronic heart diseases".  Smith also pointed out that they had not done this on their previous studies of Jewish deaths near [[Passover]] and Chinese deaths near the [[Harvest moon|Harvest Moon]], where they had used all heart disease categories.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Gary|title=Scared to Death?|date=21 December 2002|pmc=139029|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith also found no statistically relevant peaks on day 4 in data from 1969-1988 and 1999-2001 for total coronary deaths, inpatients, or the subset of heart diseases used by Phillips and colleagues, adding that there were more deaths on day 5 in the 1969-1988 data, and more deaths on day 3 in the 1999-2001 data.&lt;ref name="smith" /&gt;

In 2003, Nirmal Panesar and colleagues looked for this effect on the Chinese population of [[Hong Kong]].  They looked at mortality data from 1995 to 2000, comparing the days of the month with "deathly connotations" (4, 14 and 24) with the other days of the month on both the [[Lunar calendar|Lunar]] and [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendars, and found no statistically significant difference.&lt;ref name="panesar"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Panesar, NS|author2=Chan, NC|author3=Li SN|author4=Lo, JK|author5=Wong, VW|author6=Yang, IB|author7=Yip EK|title=Is four a deadly number for the Chinese?|journal=Med J Aust|date=December 2003|pages=656–658|pmid=14636150|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2018, Jonathan Jarry analysed this phenomenon, citing both Smith's and Panesar et al's papers, pointing out that, if the effect was real, a bigger effect would be seen in Asia, while the opposite occurs.&lt;ref name="jarry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jarry|first1=Jonathan|title=The Number Four Kills Again... Or Does It?|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/node/6859|website=McGill Office for Science and Society|publisher=McGill|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jarry states that the peak observed on the original study appears because of what the researchers decided to compare it to, and quotes epidemiologist Christopher Labos as concluding that “while the number of deaths on Day 4 may be higher than average, it is not actually statistically higher than any individual day.”

{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Cyrus the Great}}
The '''Battle of Hyrba''' was the first battle between the [[Persia]]ns and [[Medes|Media]]ns, taking place around 552 BC. It was also the first battle after the Persians had revolted. These actions were led (for the most part) by [[Cyrus the Great]], as he shifted the powers of the ancient [[Middle East]]. The Persian success in the battle led to the creation of Persia's first empire and began Cyrus's decade long conquest of almost all of the known world. Though the only authority with a detailed account of the battle was [[Nicolaus of Damascus]], other well-known historians such as [[Herodotus]], [[Ctesias]], and [[Strabo]] also mention the battle in their own accounts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'') I, 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ctesias]] (''Persica'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fragments of [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] (''[[Strabo|History]]'') XV, 3.8&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome of the battle was such a great blow to Medes that [[Astyages]] decided to personally invade Persia. The hasty invasion eventually led to his downfall. In turn, the former enemies of the Medes tried to move against them, only to be stopped by Cyrus. Thus a period of reconciliation began, which facilitated a close relationship between the Persians and Medes, and enabled [[Ecbatana]], capital of Media, to pass to the Persians as one of Persia's capitals in the newly formed empire.

==Background==
The battle occurred after the [[Persian Revolt]], which is known to have taken place in the summer of 553 BC.&lt;ref&gt;The Nabonidus Cylinder from Sippar&lt;/ref&gt; Based on scant sources the battle (which was in [[Hyrba]]) is believed to have taken place at least half a year after the revolt had already begun,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Nabonidus Chronicle]] of the [[Babylonian Chronicles]] 1&lt;/ref&gt; probably in the beginning of winter in 552 BC.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Nabonidus Chronicle]] of the [[Babylonian Chronicles]] 2&lt;/ref&gt; [[Astyages]], the king of Medes, who is thought to have also been Cyrus's grandfather, had earlier turned down the request of Cyrus to leave his court and visit his parents again, as he had done several times earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, W.B., Ilya Gershevitch, and Ehsan Yarshster, ''The Cambridge History of Iran'', Cambridge University Press (1993) p. 144. In 1 volume&lt;/ref&gt; Though his request to Astyages was not unusual, Cyrus had made the mistake of asking him right after the revolt that had happened, but through the pleading of the Persian servant, [[Oebares]], Astyages let him visit his parents again.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, W.B., Ilya Gershevitch, and Ehsan Yarshster, ''The Cambridge History of Iran'', Cambridge University Press (1993) p. 145-146. In 1 volume&lt;/ref&gt; In Herodotus' version, in one of the first times Cyrus had gone to his parents, the Median general [[Harpagus]] had secretly sent a letter stuffed in a hare to Cyrus to plot a revolt, and Cyrus passed the letter on to his father.&lt;ref&gt;Duncker, Max, ''The History of Antiquity'', tr. Evelyn Abbott, p. 349. London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 349-351&lt;/ref&gt; This matches the account of Nicolaus in which he says that [[Cambyses I]] had already assembled many troops well before the battle had started, and that he later despatched a small number to Cyrus's aid.&lt;ref&gt;Duncker, Max, ''The History of Antiquity'', tr. Evelyn Abbott, p. 350. London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 349-351&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus sent a message to his father saying "... send at once 1000 cavalry and 5000 foot-soldiers to the city of Hyrba which lay on the way, and to arm the rest of the Persians as quickly as possible in such a way that it should seem to be done by command of the king. His true aims he did not communicate to him." This also confirms the notion that the battle took place months, not days, after the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ''The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information'', Cambridge, England; New York: At the University Press, (1910) p.206&lt;/ref&gt; Astyages' decision to let Cyrus return to his parents is considered by some to have changed history by eventually enabling the [[Persis]] province to become the most powerful state in the [[ancient world]].&lt;ref&gt;Laymon, Charles M., ''The Interpreter's One Volume Commentary on the Bible: Introduction and Commentary'', Abingdon Press, (1971) p.440. In 1 volume&lt;/ref&gt;

==The motives==
Cyrus was in Ecbatana when the revolt had already begun.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh, ''The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information'', Cambridge, England; New York: At the University Press, (1910) p.207&lt;/ref&gt; In Nicolaus's account, when Cyrus was let go, he fled from Astyages because he knew he might eventually be executed if Astyages discovered that Cyrus's true motive  was to join and fight alongside his father, if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Godley A. D., ''Herodotus'', A D Godley. I, 126. London, W. Heinemann; New York, G.P. Putnam's Sons, (1921-24) p. 144. In 481 editions&lt;/ref&gt; This is because when Cyrus was half way to becoming an adult he learned that Astyages had already tried to execute him when he was an infant, but it did not succeed, and as time passed, Astyages came to respect Cyrus for the similarities of character they shared.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Godley A. D., ''Herodotus'', A D Godley. I, 124. London, W. Heinemann; New York, G.P. Putnam's Sons, (1921-24) p. 141. In 481 editions&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Astyages was not sure if it was safe to let Cyrus return to his homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Duncker, Max, ''The History of Antiquity,'' tr. Evelyn Abbott, p. 369. London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 370&lt;/ref&gt; Astyages eventually did, and it helped terminate the Median kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Duncker, Max, ''The History of Antiquity'', tr. Evelyn Abbott, p. 370. London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; When Astyages was tricked by Harpagus twice into believing Cyrus was not a danger to him, even when the revolt and impending signs of danger had already happened, Cyrus saw how easily Astyages could be swindled.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, Godley A. D., ''Herodotus,'' A D Godley. I, 125. London, W. Heinemann; New York, G.P. Putnam's Sons, (1921-24) p. 144. In 481 editions&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, Cyrus may have taken advantage of this to bring freedom to his own kingdom.&lt;ref name="Duncker, Max 1881 p. 348-349"&gt;Duncker, Max, ''The History of Antiquity'', tr. Evelyn Abbott, p. 349. London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 348-349&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|When Cyrus was again with Astyages, Oebares reminded him of his advice. Cyrus followed it, sent to Persia, and when he found that all was ready, asked Astyages, under the pretext that Oebares had suggested, for permission to go to Persia. The [[Monarch|king]] would not let him go. Then Cyrus betook himself to the most trustworthy of the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]]; when a favorable moment came, he was to obtain permission for the journey to Persia. One day, when Cyrus found the king in the best of humors and cheered with wine, he gave the eunuch a sign, and the latter said to the king: 'Cyrus asks to perform the sacrifice, which he has vowed for thee in Persia, that thou mightest continue gracious to him, and for permission to visit his sick father.'  The king called for Cyrus, and with a smile, gave him permission of absence for five months; in the sixth month, he was to return.  Cyrus bowed in gratitude before the king appointed [[Tiridates (son of Tiran of Armenia)|Tiridates]] as butler to the king during his absence, and on the next he set out to Persia.|||Nicholaus' Fragments&lt;ref name="Duncker, Max 1881 p. 348-349"/&gt;|}}

Meanwhile, Astyages invited the best singer of the Medes, and the last song played by the professional [[minstrel]] that was also a [[Magi|Magus]], named Angares, which was also accompanied by a girl, disturbed Astyages deeply.&lt;ref&gt;James Ussher,  Larry Pierce,  Marion Pierce, ''The Annals of the World'', p.109.

==The battle==
{{cquote|Astyages applied this song to himself and Cyrus, and on the spot sent 300 [[Cavalry|horsemen]] to bring him back; if he would not obey they were to cut off his head and bring that. When the horsemen brought to Cyrus the commands of Astyages, he answered cunningly,  perhaps on the advice of Oebares: 'Why should I not return as my lord summons me? Today we will feast; tomorrow morning we will set out.' This met with their approval. After the manner of the Persians, Cyrus caused many oxen and other animals to be slain in sacrifice, feasted the horsemen, and made them intoxicated; at the same time he sent a message to his father to send at once 1,000 [[cavalry]] and 5,000 [[Infantry|foot soldiers]] to the city of Hyrba which lay on the way, and to arm the rest of the Persians as quickly as possible in such a way that it should seem to be done by command of the king. His true aims he did not communicate to him. In the night he and Oebares took horse, just as they were, hastened to Hyrba, armed the inhabitants, and drew out those whom Atradates had sent in order for battle.  When the horsemen of Astyages had slept off their debauch on the following morning, and found that Cyrus had disappeared, they pursued him and went to Hyrba. Here Cyrus first displayed his bravery, for with his Persians he slew 250 of the horse of Astyages. The remainder escaped, and brought the news to Astyages.|||Nicolaus' Fragments&lt;ref&gt;Duncker, Max, ''The History of Antiquity'', tr.

London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 349-350.1&lt;/ref&gt; It is most likely Cyrus and the cavalry he had escaped with from Media fought directly with the Median cavalry Astyages had sent to bring Cyrus back.&lt;ref&gt;Duncker, Max, ''The History of Antiquity'', tr. Evelyn Abbott, p. 350.  London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 349-350.2&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus might have known he needed all his men when fighting Astyages's best cavalry, for when battle had started, Cyrus with his will and superior numbers had the advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Duncker, Max, ''The History of Antiquity'', tr. Evelyn Abbott, p. 350.  London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 349-350.3&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolas goes as far as to say Cyrus first displayed his bravery in this battle.&lt;ref&gt;Duncker, Max, ''The History of Antiquity'', tr. Evelyn Abbott, p. 350.  London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 349-350.4&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Cyrus's tactics proved successful in maintaining the war.&lt;ref&gt;Duncker, Max, ''The History of Antiquity'', tr. Evelyn Abbott, p. 350.  London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 349-350.5&lt;/ref&gt; In Herodotus' ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', he hints the first battle between the Persians and Medes, which Harpagus goes over to Cyrus, and most of the Medes either joined Cyrus or were killed, with a small force escaping back to Media.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The History of Herodotus'', tr. [[George Campbell Macaulay|G. C. Macaulay]], S.l.: Kessinger Pub., (1890), 200-? p. 55.

==Aftermath==
{{cquote|'Woe is me!' cried the king striking his thigh, 'That I, well knowing that we should not do good to the evil, have allowed myself to be carried away by clever speeches, and have raised up this [[Amard|Mardian]] to be such a mischief to me.

While Cambyses met with his son and organized the 350,000+ men, Astyages armed men under and over age for fighting battles, and from all over the empire, to come.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The History of Herodotus'', tr. [[George Campbell Macaulay|G. C. Macaulay]], S.l.: Kessinger Publications, (1890), 200-? p. 54.

Evelyn Abbott, p. 350.  London, Richard Bentley * Son (1881) p. 349-352&lt;/ref&gt; When Astyages knew he had underestimated Cyrus, he knew putting down a revolt was not enough, but a massive invasion had to be carried out, so the invasion of Persia by Astyages began.&lt;ref&gt;Clare, Israel Smith.

==Historical assessment==
The battle was the first major blow to the Medes, as this was the first time in a long time that Media had been defeated in a battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]] ([http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/english/index.html#6 ''Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus'']) I, 6 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Cyrus's first victory in the war, it did not go well with Astyages, the king of the Medes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]] (''[[Deipnosophistae]]''), 1.14 (633e) 6:419&lt;/ref&gt; It also caused the northern satraps to revolt, and ally their provinces with Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, W.B., Ilya Gershevitch, and Ehsan Yarshster, ''The Cambridge History of Iran'', Cambridge University Press (1993) p. 146-147. In 1 volume&lt;/ref&gt; Years after the war, the Persians and Medes still held a deep appreciation of one another, and some Medes were allowed to become part of the [[Persian Immortal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, W.B., Ilya Gershevitch, and Ehsan Yarshster, ''The Cambridge History of Iran'', Cambridge University Press (1993) p. 149. In 1 volume&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1900s this battle was almost forgotten to history.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, W.B., Ilya Gershevitch, and Ehsan Yarshster, ''The Cambridge History of Iran'', Cambridge University Press (1993) p. 149.5. In 1 volume&lt;/ref&gt; As most of its account comes from fragments, only in the later modern age historians have renewed interest in this (now considered) historic event which changed the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, W.B., Ilya Gershevitch, and Ehsan Yarshster, ''The Cambridge History of Iran'', Cambridge University Press (1993) p. 150. In 1 volume&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the battle started a chain reaction of events which led Persia to become the most powerful state for the next quarter of a millennia.&lt;ref&gt;All sources listed&lt;/ref&gt;

Details from Herodotus' and Nicolas' accounts also suggest the actual battle took place half a year after the revolt, which if one counts forward from the summer of 553 BC, one would reach the beginning of 552 BC. This  would have also given Cambyses ample time to gather the army and allies for battle.

The '''Beloit Riverfest''' was an annual music festival held in July at Riverside Park in [[Beloit, Wisconsin]].  The festival attracted thousands of people from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], who came to see internationally known musicians perform. It billed itself as "the largest rock festival of the Midwest".{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} In addition to music, the festival had a carnival, shops, and food vendors.  Riverfest was held the second week of July and ran from Thursday through Sunday.

The Riverfest Board of Directors voted to discontinue the festival in 2013 because of reduced financial support and difficulty in recruiting new board members.&lt;ref&gt;Clint Wolf and Debra Jensen-DeHart.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29038">{{About|bullying involving physicians|bullying involving nurses|Bullying in nursing}}
[[Bullying]] in the [[medical profession]] is common, particularly of student or trainee physicians. It is thought that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical structures]] and [[teaching methods]] in the medical profession which may result in a bullying cycle.

According to Field, bullies are attracted to the caring professions, such as medicine, by the opportunities to exercise power over vulnerable clients, employees and students.

While the stereotype of a victim as a weak  person who somehow deserves to be bullied is salient, there is growing evidence that bullies, who are often driven by jealousy and envy, pick on the highest performing and most skilled students, whose mere presence is sufficient to make the bully feel insecure. The victim are usually high academic achievers and are likely to have been top of the class throughout their school years. As medical students have to compete against each other, this can make certain trainee doctors eager to stand out from the crowd, and some use underhand techniques to gain academic recognition.

The rampant problem of [[medical student]] mistreatment and bullying was systematically studied and reported in a 1990 JAMA study by pediatrician Henry K. Silver which found that 46.4 percent of students at one medical school had been abused at some point during medical school; by the time they were seniors, that number was 80.6 percent.&lt;ref name="ama-assn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2014/03/fred1-1403.html|title=VM – To Bully and Be Bullied: Harassment and Mistreatment in Medical Education, Mar 14 ...

In a 2002 test, 594 BMA members were randomly selected to complete a bullying survey, and 220 of the 594 junior doctors reported having been bullied in the previous year. This survey reported no variance in job grade or age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quine|first=Lyn|date=2002-04-13|title=Workplace bullying in junior doctors: questionnaire survey|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/324/7342/878|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=324|issue=7342|pages=878–879|doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7342.878|issn=0959-8138|pmid=11950736|pmc=101400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bullying cycle===
Medical training usually takes place in institutions that have a highly structured [[Hierarchical organization|hierarchical system]], and has traditionally involved teaching by [[intimidation]] and humiliation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Such practices may foster a culture of bullying and the setting up of a cycle of bullying, analogous to other [[cycle of abuse|cycles of abuse]] in which those who experience it go on to abuse others when they become more senior. Medical doctors are increasingly reporting to the [[British Medical Association]] that they are being bullied, often by older and more senior colleagues, many of whom were badly treated themselves when more junior.&lt;ref&gt;Williams K (1998) Stress linked to bullying. BMA News Review, April 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Physician Jonathan Belsey relates in an emblematic narrative published in AMA Virtual Mentor entitled Teaching By Humiliation that "however well you presented the case, somewhere along the line you would trip up and give the predatory professor his opportunity to expose your inadequacies. Sometimes it would be your lack of medical knowledge; sometimes the question that you failed to ask the patient that would have revealed the root of the problem, or sometimes your ineptitude at eliciting the required clinical signs. On one memorable occasion, when I had appeared to cover all the bases clinically, the professor turned to me and berated me for attending his ward round wearing a plaid shirt that was clearly inappropriate for an aspiring doctor."&lt;ref name="ama-assn3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2014/03/mnar1-1403.html|title=VM – Teaching by Humiliation—Why It Should Change, Mar 14 ...

==Impact==
Bullying can significantly decrease [[job satisfaction]] and increase job-induced stress; it also leads to low [[self-confidence]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and a desire to leave employment.&lt;ref name=Field/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=435–42 |doi=10.1016/S0031-9384(01)00490-5 |title=Social defeat as a stressor in humans |year=2001 |last1=Björkqvist |first1=K |journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior |volume=73 |issue=3 |pmid=11438372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying contributes to high rates of [[Turnover (employment)|staff turnover]], high rates of sickness absence, impaired performance, lower [[productivity]], poor [[team spirit]] and loss of trained staff.&lt;ref name=Field/&gt; This has implications for the [[recruitment]] and retention of medical staff.

Chronic and current bullying are associated with substantially worse health,&lt;ref name="aappublications"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/02/11/peds.2013-3510|title=Peer Victimization in Fifth Grade and Health in Tenth Grade|publisher=pediatrics.aappublications.org|accessdate=2015-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to research by Laura M. Bogart, associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.

Studies have consistently shown that physicians have had the highest depression and suicide rates compared to people in many other lines of work—for suicide, 40% higher for male physicians and 130% higher for female physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rotenstein|first=Lisa S.|last2=Ramos|first2=Marco A.|last3=Torre|first3=Matthew|last4=Segal|first4=J.

Exposure to bullying and intimidation during formative years of medical training has been found to contribute to these consequences. Fear of stigmatisation among medical students was the subject of a study in JAMA by Thomas Schwenk and colleagues at the University of Michigan's Department of Family Medicine, MI, USA. 53% of medical students who reported high levels of depressive symptoms were worried that revealing their illness would be risky for their careers and 62% said asking for help would mean their coping skills were inadequate, according to the study published in September 2010. "Medical students are under extraordinary demands. They feel they are making life and death decisions and that they can never be wrong. There is such tremendous pressure to be perfect that any sense of falling short makes them very anxious", says Schwenk.&lt;ref name="thelancet"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)60145-1/fulltext|title= Doctors in distress|accessdate=2015-02-09 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60145-1|volume=377|journal=The Lancet|pages=454–455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Medical students===
{{Main|Bullying in academia}}
Medical students, perhaps being vulnerable because of their relatively low status in health care settings, may experience [[verbal abuse]], [[humiliation]] and [[harassment]] (nonsexual or sexual). [[Discrimination]] based on gender and race are less common.&lt;ref name=Coverdale&gt;{{cite journal |pages=269–73 |doi=10.1176/appi.ap.33.4.269 |title=Mistreatment of Trainees: Verbal Abuse and Other Bullying Behaviors |year=2009 |last1=Coverdale |first1=J. H. |last2=Balon |first2=R. |last3=Roberts |first3=L. W. |journal=Academic Psychiatry |volume=33 |issue=4 |pmid=19690101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, around 35% of medical students reported having been bullied. Around one in four of the 1,000 students questioned said they had been bullied by a medical doctor. Furthermore, bullying has been known to occur among medical students. Manifestations of bullying include:&lt;ref&gt;Curtis P [https://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/may/04/highereducation.science Medical students complain of bullying] [[The Guardian]] 4 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* being humiliated by teachers in front of patients or peers
* been [[victimised]] for not having come from a "medical family" (often people who enter medicine have an older sibling pursuing the same degree or share ties with other individuals in the profession with whom familial relationship confers some degree of protection or special influence – especially within academic settings.) Such practices extend to admissions procedures, which are regularly influenced by factors far afield of candidates' intrinsic merits, such as being related to faculty members or well-known medical luminaries.&lt;ref name="ama-assn2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2012/12/ecas3-1212.html|title=VM – Legacy Admissions in Medical School, Dec 12 ...

* being put under pressure to carry out a procedure without supervision.
* being ostracized by other medical students for asking questions (due to the medical content being confusing for some students) through social media networks ([[Facebook]] bullying), phone, or in person.

One study showed that the medical faculty was the faculty in which students were most commonly mistreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1472-6920-5-36 |year=2005 |last1=Rautio |first1=Arja |last2=Sunnari |first2=Vappu |last3=Nuutinen |first3=Matti |last4=Laitala |first4=Marja |journal=BMC Medical Education |volume=5 |pages=36 |pmid=16232310 |title=Mistreatment of university students most common during medical studies |pmc=1285362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Junior (trainee) physicians===
In a UK study, 37% of [[junior doctors]] reported being bullied in the previous year and 84% had experienced at least one bullying behaviour. Black and Asian physicians were more likely to be bullied than other physicians {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}. Women were more likely to be bullied than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=878–9 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7342.878 |title=Workplace bullying in junior doctors: Questionnaire survey |year=2002 |last1=Quine |first1=L. |journal=BMJ |volume=324 |issue=7342 |pmid=11950736 |pmc=101400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trainee physicians who feel threatened in the clinical workplace develop less effectively and are less likely to ask for advice or help when they need it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1096266 |year=1975 |last1=Israël |first1=E |last2=Louwette |first2=R |last3=Lambotte |first3=C |title=Two familial cases of congenital erythroderma ichthyosiforme |volume=30 |issue=13 |pages=439–44 |journal=Revue médicale de Liège}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persistent destructive [[criticism]], [[sarcastic]] comments and humiliation in front of colleagues

The farewell interview from [[Sir Ian Kennedy]] (Chair of the Healthcare Commission) caused significant media interest following his statement that bullying is a 'corrosive' problem that the NHS must address.

===Psychiatry===
[[Psychiatric]] trainees experience rates of bullying at least as high as other medical students. In a survey of psychiatric trainees in the West Midlands, 47% had experienced bullying within the last year with even higher percentages amongst ethnic minorities and females. Qualified psychiatrists are not themselves required to be psychiatrically assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=225–7 |doi=10.1192/pb.28.6.225 |title=A survey of workplace bullying of psychiatric trainees in the West Midlands |year=2004 |last1=Hoosen |first1=I.

===Patients and nurses===
{{Main|Patient abuse|Bullying in nursing}}
{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}
There have been quite a few proven cases of doctors bullying and/or [[Sexual harassment|sexually harassing]] patients and nurses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stripes.com/news/doctor-faces-court-martial-in-patient-abuse-case-1.98060 Doctor faces court-martial in patient abuse case] Stars and Stripes January 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2157662.stm 'Groping' surgeon found guilty] BBC News 28 July 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of many doctors' predilection for bullying nurses, Theresa Brown writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the most damaging bullying is not flagrant and does not fit the stereotype of a surgeon having a tantrum in the operating room. It is passive, like not answering pages or phone calls, and tends toward the subtle: condescension rather than outright abuse, and aggressive or sarcastic remarks rather than straightforward insults.&lt;ref&gt;title="Physician Heel Thyself"|url='https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/08/opinion/08Brown.html'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Popular culture==
[[Sir Lancelot Spratt]], a character played by actor [[James Robertson Justice]] in the film series ''[[Doctor in the House]]'', is often referenced as the archetypal arrogant bullying doctor ruling by fear. The film series also demonstrates bullying of student doctors by other doctors and the nursing matron.

In the American sitcom ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', Dr. Cox uses intimidation and sarcasm as methods of tormenting the interns and expressing his dislike towards them and their company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4139">The '''Carolina Herrera Spring 2014 Ready-to-Wear Collection''' was presented on September 9, 2013, during Mercedes-Benz [[Fashion Week Cleveland|Fashion Week]], at the [[Damrosch Park|Theatre in Damrosch Park]] at [[Lincoln Center]] in [[New York City|New York]]. It was inspired by the [[Kinetic Art]] Movement, specifically [[Venezuela]]n artists [[Carlos Cruz-Diez]] and [[Jesus Rafael Soto]].  More than an abstract reference, [[Carolina Herrera (fashion designer)|Herrera]] manipulated design and fabrication to create a kinetic movement within her silhouette.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wwd.com/runway/spring-ready-to-wear-2014/review/carolina-herrera|title = Women's Wear Daily|date = 2013-09-09|accessdate = |website = WWD|publisher = WWD|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethereal collection predominantly featured fluid dresses and long, flowing gowns, with only four of the 45 looks including loosely tailored pants. She juxtaposed sheer fabrications of tulle and meshlike insets in opposing patterns to create an [[optical illusion]], then enhanced the depth and dimension with appliqués, embellishments, and geometric embroideries, which were partially sewn to create a fluttering effect. The neutral palette of ivory, black, and taupe was punctuated by vibrant tones of green, clay, pink, and mauve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/fashion/fashion-review-carolina-herrera-derek-lam-diane-von-furstenberg.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1387582518-8fUQUtLrwfEHW0+iAF2O0Q&amp;|title = The New York Times|date = 2013-09-09|accessdate = |website = newyorktimes.com|publisher = The New York Times|last = Horyn|first = Cathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“The Carolina Herrera woman has always been a classy, cosmopolitan character," noted Katharine K. Zarrella of [[Style.com]]. Backstage post-show, [[Carolina Herrera (fashion designer)|Carolina Herrera]] described her muse as “active and international, stopping in France one day and South America the next.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.style.com/fashionshows/review/S2014RTW-CHERRERA |title=Style.com |date=2013-09-09 |accessdate= |website=Style.com |publisher=Style.com |last=Zarrella |first=Katharine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729103538/http://www.style.com/fashionshows/review/S2014RTW-CHERRERA |archivedate=2014-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; “You’re going to be dizzy!” she said at a preview of her spring 2014 collection with ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. “It’s eye-popping!”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/fashion-week/spring-2014-rtw/carolina-herrera/review/ |title=Vogue.com |date=2013-09-09 |accessdate= |website=Vogue.com |publisher=Vogue.com |last=Bowles |first=Hamish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811221453/http://www.vogue.com/fashion-week/spring-2014-rtw/carolina-herrera/review/ |archivedate=2014-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hair stylist]] Orlando Pita was inspired by cone-shaped shells for his structured [[French twist (hairstyle)|french twist]]. [[MAC Cosmetics]] artist Diane Kendall created a modern-day [[Twiggy]] look with the emphasis on the eyes and rosy pink blush.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wwd.com/runway/spring-ready-to-wear-2014/backstage-beauty/carolina-herrera|title = WWD|date = 2013-09-09|accessdate = |website = WWD.com|publisher = WWD|last = Naughton|first = Julie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9652">{{Wikisource|1=Ceylon Citizenship Act}}
The '''Ceylon Citizenship Act No. 18 of 1948''' was a controversial law passed by the [[Sri Lankan Parliament|Ceylon Parliament]] which did not grant [[citizenship]] to [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamils]], who were 11% of the [[population]].

==Background==
During the 19th and early 20th centuries the [[United Kingdom|British]] rulers of [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] recruited large numbers of [[South Indians]], primarily [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Indian Tamils]], to work in [[tea]], [[coffee]], [[rubber]] and [[coconut]] [[plantations]] in Ceylon. By 1946 their numbers had grown to 780,000, 11.7% of the population. Their presence was resented by [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] [[nationalists]]. There was real fear amongst the Indian Tamils that once Ceylon obtained [[independence]], the Sinhalese, who constituted 69.4% of the population, would take steps to remove them from the country.

==The Bill==
Shortly after independence on 4 February 1948 the new Sinhalese dominated government of [[Ceylon]] introduced the ''Ceylon Citizenship Bill'' before Parliament. The outward purpose of the Bill was to provide means of obtaining citizenship, but its real purpose was to discriminate against the Indian Tamils by denying them citizenship.&lt;ref name=UNHCR&gt;{{cite web |title=Statelessness in Sri Lanka |url=http://www.unhcr.lk/protection/statelessness/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20091023063136/http://www.unhcr.lk/protection/statelessness/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 October 2009 |publisher=[[UNHCR]] in Sri Lanka |accessdate=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill stipulated that anyone wishing to obtain citizenship had to [[Proof (truth)|prove]] that their [[father]] was born in Ceylon i.e. that they were at least [[Immigrant generations|third generation immigrants]]. This was an impossible task for most Indian Tamils. Few were at least third generation immigrants because they tended to return to India to give birth.&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt; Those who were at least third-generation immigrants rarely had the necessary documents because they rarely registered [[births]].&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt; Therefore, they could not prove the requirements for citizenship.

The Bill was opposed fiercely in Parliament by the [[Ceylon Workers' Congress|Ceylon Indian Congress]], which represented the Indian Tamils, and the Sinhalese [[leftist]] parties. The bill was also opposed by the [[All Ceylon Tamil Congress]], which represented the [[Sri Lankan Tamils]], including its leader [[G.G. Ponnambalam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=103rd Birth Anniversary today : G. G. Ponnambalam - Founder of ACTC |url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2003/11/08/fea08.html |date=8 November 2003 |publisher=Daily News, Sri Lanka |accessdate=20 June 2009 |author=Apparthuray Vinayagamoorthy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604163811/http://www.dailynews.lk/2003/11/08/fea08.html |archivedate=4 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill was passed by Parliament on 20 August 1948 and became law on 15 November 1948, just 285 days after Ceylon had gained independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Only about 5,000 Indian Tamils qualified for citizenship. More than 700,000 people, about 11% of the population, were denied citizenship and made [[statelessness|stateless]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ices.lk/sl_database/ethnic_conflict/time_line.shtml Ethnic Conflict of Sri Lanka: Time Line - From Independence to 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212123102/http://www.ices.lk/sl_database/ethnic_conflict/time_line.shtml |date=2009-12-12 }}, International Centre for Ethnic Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In 1949 the Ceylon Parliament passed a different subsequent act called ''Indian and Pakistani Residents (Citizenship) Act No.3 of 1949'' whose outward purpose, again, was to provide means of obtaining citizenship for the Indian Tamils. But in reality the conditions imposed by the Act were such that they discriminated against the Indian Tamils.&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt; The Act granted citizenship to anyone who had 10 years of uninterrupted residence in Ceylon (7 years for married persons) and whose [[income]] was above the stipulated level. Again, this was an impossible task for most Indian Tamils. They had a habit of periodically returning to India, thereby interrupting their residence in Ceylon, and most could not meet the income qualification.&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt; Only about 100,000 Indian Tamils qualified for citizenship under this Act.{{citation needed|reason=Conthe Bill section mentions it as 5,000 - See Talk page for this wiki|date=August 2015}}

Later in 1949 the Ceylon Parliament passed the ''Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Amendment Act No.48 of 1949'' which stripped the Indian Tamils of their [[Suffrage|franchise]]. Seven of the 95 [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s elected at the [[Ceylonese parliamentary election, 1947|1947 general elections]] were Indian Tamils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Missed Opportunities and the Loss of Democracy  |url=http://www.uthr.org/BP/volume1/Chapter1.htm |publisher=[[UTHR]] |accessdate=20 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Tamils influenced the result in 20 other [[Electoral district|constituencies]], very often voting for the opposition Sinhalese leftist parties. None of the 95 MPs elected at the [[Ceylonese parliamentary election, 1952|1952 general elections]] were Indian Tamils.

On 18 January 1954 [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|Ceylon Prime Minister]] [[John Kotelawala]] signed the ''[[Nehru-Kotelawala Pact]]'' under which India agreed to the [[repatriation]] of any Indian Tamil who wanted Indian citizenship. But India refused to automatically provide Indian citizenship to those who did not qualify for Ceylon citizenship.&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SRI LANKA: THE UNTOLD STORY  |url=http://www.atimes.com/ind-pak/CK17Df01.html |date=17 November 2001 |publisher=Asia Times |accessdate=20 June 2009 |author=K T Rajasingham }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October 1964 [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Lal Shastri]] and [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|Ceylon Prime Minister]] [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] signed the ''[[Sirima-Shastri Pact]]'' (also known as the ''Indo-Ceylon Agreement'') under which India agreed to the repatriation of 525,000 Indian Tamils. Another 300,000 would be offered Ceylon citizenship. The fate of the remaining 150,000 Indian Tamils would be decided later.&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=29 October 1964 |url=http://pact.lk/29-october-1964/ |publisher=Peace and Conflict Timeline |accessdate=20 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128112857/http://pact.lk/29-october-1964/# |archive-date=2015-01-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 1974 [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]] and [[Prime Minister of Sri Lanka|Ceylon Prime Minister]] [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]] signed the ''Sirimavo-Gandhi Pact'' under which India and Sri Lanka agreed to grant citizenship to the 150,000 Indian Tamils whose status was left unresolved by the ''Sirima-Shastri Pact''.&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1974 |url=http://pact.lk/2008/04/26/1974/ |publisher=Peace and Conflict Timeline |accessdate=20 June 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 India abrogated the ''Sirima-Shastri Pact'' and ''Sirimavo-Gandhi Pact''. At this point 90,000 Indian Tamils who had been granted Indian citizenship were still in Sri Lanka and another 86,000 were in the process of applying for Indian citizenship.&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1982 |url=http://pact.lk/1982-2/|publisher=Peace and Conflict Timeline |accessdate=20 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 the Sri Lankan Parliament passed the ''Grant of Citizenship to Stateless Persons Act'' which granted Sri Lankan citizenship to all Indian Tamils who hadn't applied for Indian citizenship under previous agreements.&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1988 |url=http://pact.lk/2008/04/30/1988/ |publisher=Peace and Conflict Timeline |accessdate=20 June 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2003 the Sri Lankan Parliament unanimously passed the ''Grant of Citizenship to Persons of Indian Origin Act No.35 of 2003'' which granted Sri Lankan citizenship to all Indian Tamils who had been residing in Sri Lanka since October 1964 and their descendents. This amounted to 168,141 persons and included those who had been granted Indian citizenship under previous agreements but were still living in Sri Lanka, though they had to rescind their Indian citizenship.&lt;ref name=UNHCR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=October 2003 |url=http://pact.lk/october-2003/|publisher=Peace and Conflict Timeline |accessdate=20 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All Indian Tamils living in Sri Lanka had finally been granted Sri Lankan citizenship, 55 years after independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stateless Tamils’ long struggle bears fruit |url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=79&amp;artid=10064 |publisher=[[TamilNet]] |date=7 October 2003 |accessdate=20 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5786">'''Charity [[fraud]]''' is the act of using [[deception]] to get money from people who believe they are making donations to [[charities]].  Often a person or a group of people will make material representations that they are a charity or part of a charity and ask prospective donors for contributions to the non-existent charity. Charity fraud not only includes fictitious charities but also deceitful business acts. Deceitful business acts include businesses accepting donations and not using the money for its intended purposes.

==Examples==
*On April 20, 1918, ''The New York Times'' published an article about a charity fraud committed by the Secretary of the Cripples’ Welfare Society, George W. Ryder. Ryder pleaded guilty to using mail fraud to use the donations for his personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1918/04/20/archives/charity-fraud-pleads-guilty.html?sq=charity+fraud&amp;scp=2&amp;st=Search "Charity Fraud Pleads Guilty." ''The New York Times.'' 20 April 1918. Web. 3 March 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On November 13, 1992, ''The New York Times'' released an article about fraudulent solicitations supporting a cause. Often, beside the cash register in stores, a collection is taken for a charity or for people in need. Although there have been many store owners that legitimately donate the spare change to the specified charity, there are a few who act fraudulently. In this specific case, the small-change donations were being kept by the vendors. The article states that the vendors paid a $2 per month fee to use the charity’s name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/13/nyregion/small-change-donations-going-to-vendors-not-charities-abrams-charges.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Small-Change%20Donations%20Going%20to%20Vendors,%20Not%20Charities,%20Abrams%20Charges&amp;st=cse McFadden, Robert. "Small-Change Donations Going to Vendors, Not Charities, Abrams Charges." ''The New York Times''. 12 11 1992. Web. 13 February 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention in the United States of America==
There are controls and laws governing charities and businesses that accept donations. The [[Internal Revenue Service]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/charities/article/0,,id=169727,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; (IRS) with the [[Better Business Bureau]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbb.org/us/Charity-Standards/|title=Home|website=www.bbb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (BBB) has regulations that can be found on their websites.
 
The United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) provides online information about avoiding charity fraud, such as fraudulent schemes that emerge in the wake of natural disasters, claiming to be providing disaster relief. The Internet Crime Complaint Center maintains a list of guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic3.gov/media/2011/110311.aspx|title=Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) - Tips On Avoiding Fraudulent Charitable Contribution Schemes|website=www.ic3.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid charity fraud when making a donation.

It is advised that people should follow certain guidelines when they donate and that they should consult a list such as the one on the BBB’s website. This list includes the participants in the BBB Wise Giving Alliance's National Charity Seal Program. Participants have met standards for charity accountability and may, for a fee, display the seal logo on their websites as well as any other printed documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/public/participants.asp National Charity Seal Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305043830/http://www.bbb.org/charity-reviews/public/participants.asp |date=March 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrast with badge charity==
Charity fraud is distinguished from [[Circle_of_Friends_for_American_Veterans#Badge_Charity|badge charity]] in which the charity does exist, but an inordinate percentage the funds donated are absorbed by professional fundraisers and operating expenses of the charity rather than the causes described in solicitations.

'''Charles-Léonce Brossé''' (born 1871), also known as '''Bsor''' or '''Bzor''', was a French painter; engraver and lithographer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victordecessole.org/dwn/Victor_de_Cessole_02.pdf ''Le Chevalier Victor Spitalieri de Cessole, un bibliophile, philanthrope et alpiniste'', p. 27.]&lt;/ref&gt; He is most well known for his poster "Meeting d'Aviation Nice," promoting an early "aviation meet" or [[air show]] held in [[Nice]], France, April 10–25, 1910. The poster depicts a pilot scattering roses from his airplane flying high over the Nice coast. Notice the shape of the left wing is mirrored in the shape of the water above and below the right wing. The lettering at the top is in a distinct [[Art Nouveau]] style and surrounds a crowned red eagle, representing the [[Nice#Coat of arms|arms of Nice]], with exaggerated wings extending far beyond the shield and resembling the wings of an airplane. The poster has been credited with contributing to "Nice’s glamorous image."&lt;ref&gt;Laura McPhee,''A Journey Into Matisse's South of France'', Roaring Forties Press, Berkeley, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reprinted numerous times and also has  been reproduced on coffee mugs and other objects. Brossé also designed bookplates, including one in 1912 for the [[alpinist]] Spitalieri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victordecessole.org/dwn/Victor_de_Cessole_02.pdf ''Le Chevalier Victor Spitalieri de Cessole, un bibliophile, philanthrope et alpiniste'', p. 29.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christmas]] in the [[United States]] during the [[post-war]] years (1946&amp;ndash;1964) reflected a period of peace, productivity, and prosperity. Americans staged sumptuous Christmases and enjoyed a variety of holiday foods unknown to previous generations. Several films, foods, toys, and television programs of the era have become American Christmas traditions.

Once reliant upon Germany for its ornaments, toys, and even its Christmas customs, America became self-sufficient in the post-War years with Christmas ornaments and toys being manufactured in the United States that were considerably less expensive than their German counterparts. American Christmas customs and traditions such as visits to department store Santas and letter writing to Santa at the [[North Pole]] remained intact during America's post-War years, but the era generated contributions that have endured to become traditions.

[[NORAD Tracks Santa|NORAD's tracking of Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve]], for example, was initiated in 1955 and has become an annual tradition. The stop motion animated film, ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' remains an annual telecast on American television&amp;mdash;more than fifty years after its debut, and Dr. Seuss's ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' of 1957 has become a literary Christmas classic.

Several Christmas firsts mark the post-War era that include the first [[White House]] [[Christmas card]], the first Christmas postage stamp, the first opera composed for television (''[[Amahl and the Night Visitors]]''), the first Christmas Day [[basketball]] game, and the first [[Elvis Presley]] Christmas album. The era saw the production and manufacture of toys that have become classics such as ''[[Candy Land]]'', [[Mr. Potato Head]], and [[Barbie]].

==Christmas trees==

===Types===
[[File:Xmas1951.jpg|thumb|An unsheared Christmas tree in New York State circa 1951 displays the natural form of the tree's branches.]]
During the post-War years, Americans could select their [[Christmas tree]]s from a variety of offerings. Natural trees had become the preferred choice in America when [[Christmas tree farm]]s began supplying them to large metropolitan areas in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt; Artificial trees of bristles, aluminum trees, and flocked trees became alternatives to real trees during the post-War period.

====Natural====
In 1900, only one in five American families had a Christmas tree. While America never lacked for real trees, the time and expense of retrieving them from the wild was significant. Early in the twentieth century, however, Christmas tree farms began supplying large metropolitan areas with real trees. In the 1920s, real trees became commonplace, supplanting artificial trees in American homes.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

====Artificial====
Artificial trees made of goose feathers were in use in American homes since the 1880s. In the 1930s, however, The Addis Brush Company, an American toilet bowl brush manufacturer, began making artificial trees of green-dyed bristles and then supplied the British (who suffered a dearth of wild trees) with thousands of artificial trees in the post-War years. Americans took little interest in the Addis artificial trees and remained loyal to real trees.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

====Aluminum====
[[File:Aluminum Christmas tree2.jpg|thumb|Aluminum trees had a futuristic, [[Space Age]] look that was compatible with the streamlined designs of post-War home furnishings.]]

In 1950, the Addis Brush Company patented an [[aluminum Christmas tree]], the Silver Pine, that came with a floodlight and a rotating color wheel.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;  Modern Coatings, Inc. of Chicago manufactured aluminum trees in 1958, and The [[Aluminum Specialty Company]] of [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin]] manufactured more than a million aluminum trees between 1959 and 1969. The trees, including the company's flagship product the "Evergleam", retailed for $25.&lt;ref name=baltsun&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/services/newspaper/printedition/sunday/harfordcounty/bal-ha.trees26oct26,0,204546.story |title=It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas (1958) |accessdate=2009-01-26 |first=Cassandra A. |last=Fortin |publisher=The Baltimore Sun |date=2008-10-26}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aluminum tree spectacle could be enhanced with a rotating [[Christmas tree stand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/2004/12/01/8192187/index.htm |title=Trees Made of Tinsel |accessdate=2009-01-26 |first=Paul |last=Lukas |publisher=Money Magazine via CNNMoney.com |date=2004-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The futuristic, Space Age look of the trees made them especially suited to the streamlined home decor of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kshs.org/cool2/cooltree.htm |title=Aluminum Christmas Trees |accessdate=2009-01-26 |work=Cool Things |publisher=Kansas State Historical Society |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sales of aluminum trees declined after being treated satirically in the 1965 animated Christmas television special, ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Candice Gaukel. ''Great Wisconsin Winter Weekends''. Big Earth Publishing, 2006. {{ISBN|1-931599-71-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flocked====
In the 1960s, [[flocking (texture)|flocked]] Christmas trees in purple, gold, pink, and even black became popular. The trees' branches were coated in a chemically-created, flame retardant substance resembling snow. Sophisticated style mavens suggested developing a new Christmas tree theme every year and buying color coordinated ornaments. Natural trees would return to favor in the 1970s when country arts and crafts became popular.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

===Decorations===
The post-War period saw changes in the production of Christmas tree ornaments. Shiny Brite and other ornament companies began mass-producing inexpensive glass ornaments. Bubble lights were introduced during the period, and inexpensive, lit-from-within tree toppers were another option for the tree.&lt;ref name="Waggoner" /&gt;

====Toppers and stands====
In the post-War years, translucent, molded plastic, electrified, lit-from-within tree toppers in the shape of angels and stars became popular. Although Santa Claus and other Christmas icons were introduced as electrified toppers, the star and the angel of the [[Victorian era]] remained the preferred motif. Glass spire ornaments were also popular as toppers.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

The first decorated water reservoir tree stands appeared on the American market in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt; Tin Christmas tree stands decorated with [[lithography|lithographed]] holiday icons manufactured by National Outfit Manufacturers Association were produced in the 1950s and have become collectibles of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countryliving.com/antiques/appraisals/christmas-tree-stand-1208 |title=Christmas Tree Stand: What Is It? What Is It Worth? |accessdate=2009-01-26 |first=Helaine |last=Fendelman |work=Q&amp;A: Antiques Appraisal |publisher=Country Living |date=n.d. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lights====
[[File:NOMA Bubble Lights 03.jpg|thumb|NOMA bubbling Christmas lights were launched in 1946 and became hugely popular.]]

[[Bubble light]]s, a type of incandescent novelty light, were invented by Carl Otis in 1935, who then sold the patents to the NOMA (National Outfit Manufacturer's Association) Electric Corporation. NOMA launched the novelty lights on the Christmas market in 1946 when war shortages ended. Bubble lights became hugely popular.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt; Their main feature was a sealed glass tube with a colored bubbling liquid inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldchristmastreelights.com/bubble_lights1.htm |title=The History of Bubble Lights |accessdate=2009-01-26 |first=George |last=Nelson |publisher=OldChristmasTreeLights.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other companies followed with their own bubble light versions and other lighting novelties. In 1946, [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]] introduced [[fluorescent light|fluorescent pastel light]]s. In 1955, NOMA manufactured flashing lights. In 1958, [[General Electric|GE]] launched Lighted Ice Bulbs, blue bulbs covered with 'ice' crystals. [[Fairy Lights]] were imported from Europe in 1950 and eventually morphed into the inexpensive mini-lights popular in the last decades of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

====Ornaments====
German glass ornaments were introduced to America by [[Frank Woolworth]] in the 1880s but such ornaments were produced under labor-intensive conditions and were expensive, with few Americans being able to afford more than one or two ornaments per year. On the eve of [[World War II]], however, American companies began manufacturing inexpensive, mass-produced ornaments that made it possible for almost any American to have an extensive collection of Christmas ornaments for little cost within moments. With a few modifications, [[Corning Glass]]'s light bulb machine could spit out 2,000 blank glass ornaments a minute that were then bought by ornament companies to be decorated, packaged and sold by the dozen.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

Shatter-resistant and shatterproof ornaments are one adaptation, among many others, to make Christmas pet-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.balsamhill.com/how-to-make-your-christmas-tree-pet-friendly&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Shiny Brite=====
[[File:Shiny Brite Assortment.JPG|thumb|An assortment of Shiny Brite ornaments display silk screened images of seasonal motifs such as snowy scenes and poinsettias.]]

Max Eckhardt's Shiny Brite company manufactured colorful glass ornaments in a variety of sizes and shapes through the era. Packed in boxes by the dozen or half dozen, glimpses of the ornaments could be caught through the cellophane windows of the boxes' covers. The reds and greens of the past were supplemented with turquoise, chartreuse, orange, purple, and other vibrant colors.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

Glittery bands of [[mica]] decorated some balls while others were silk screened with seasonal motifs such as snowy scenes, sleigh rides, carolers, and poinsettias. Some balls featured silvery indents on their surfaces that reflected the surrounding light. In the early 1950s, clear glass balls appeared decorated with bands of color or glittering sparkles. Molded plastic Santa Clauses, angels, snowmen, and other holiday icons were inexpensive, mass-produced, and readily available.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

===Outdoor lighting===
[[File:DenCtyHallChristmas1955.jpg|thumb|Denver City Hall lit up with Christmas lights, 1955.]]

{{Main|Christmas lights (holiday decoration)}}
[[McAdenville, North Carolina]] claims the distinction of being the first community to use outdoor Christmas lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcadenville-christmastown.com/cthistory.htm |title=Christmas Town, USA: McAdenville, North Carolina  |accessdate=2009-01-27 |first=Steve |last=Rankin |publisher= |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Library of Congress]] notes that "the tradition of decorating evergreen trees with Christmas lights dates back to 1956 when the McAdenville Men's Club conceived of the idea of decorating a few trees around the McAdenville Community Center."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cocoon/legacies/NC/200003236.html |title=North Carolina: Christmas Town U.S.A. |accessdate=2009-01-27 |work=Local Legacies: Celebrating Community Roots |publisher=Library of Congress: Folklife Center |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree]] has had "lights" since 1931, the Rockefeller Tree did not have real electric lights until 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wnbc.com/christmastree/1775354/detail.html |title=Christmas in Rockefeller Center: A Holiday History |accessdate=2009-01-27 |work=Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree News Story |publisher=WNBC New York |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Philadelphia's Christmas Light Show and Disney's Christmas Tree also began in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wanamakerorgan.com/xmas.html |title=Friends of the Wanamaker Organ |accessdate=2009-01-27 |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christmastree.org/famous.cfm |title=National Christmas Tree Association: Famous Trees |accessdate=2009-01-27 |date=n.d. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116205252/http://www.christmastree.org/famous.cfm |archivedate=2009-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though GE  sponsored community lighting competitions during the 1920s, it was not until the mid-1950s that outdoor Christmas lighting was adopted by most Americans. Strings of lights gradually began adorning mantles and doorways inside houses, and trimming the rafters, roof lines, and porch railings outside.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

===National Christmas Tree===
[[File:Harry-truman.jpg|thumb|upright|From his home in Missouri, President Truman signaled the lighting of the National Christmas Tree via remote control every Christmas from 1948 to 1951.]]

The tradition of having a [[National Christmas Tree (United States)|National Christmas Tree]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] began in 1923 when a 48-foot [[Balsam Fir]] from [[Vermont]] was placed in the Ellipse outside the [[White House]]. On Christmas Eve, President [[Calvin Coolidge]] lit the 2,500 red, white and green electric bulbs on the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/whho/historyculture/1923-national-christmas-tree.htm |title=1923 National Christmas Tree |accessdate=2009-01-26 |first=Laura |last=Schiavo |publisher=National Park Service |date=n.d., (1998?)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] had the tree moved from the Ellipse to the White House grounds, where it remained until 1954 when it was returned to the Ellipse. In 1946, the lighting ceremony became a televised event, though not with widespread telecast. From 1948 to 1951, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signalled the lighting of the tree by remote control from his [[Independence, Missouri]] home, but in 1952, he stayed at the White House for the lighting ceremony. In 1953, the ceremony was widely telecast and President [[Dwight David Eisenhower]]'s address was radio broadcast through the [[Voice of America]] in thirty-four languages.&lt;ref name="NPSTree"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/whho/historyculture/1941-1953-national-christmas-trees.htm |title=1941-1953 National Christmas Trees |accessdate=2009-01-26 |first=Laura |last=Schiavo |date=n.d. |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, businessmen in the Washington, D.C. area became involved and greatly expanded the program with the Christmas Pageant of Peace. The Pageant centered around the lighting of the Christmas tree, and included various elements such as a life-sized reproduction of the [[nativity scene]]. Every year from 1954 to 1972, a tree was cut and brought to the White House from a different [[U.S. state|US state]] and installed at the Ellipse. The ceremony of the tree lighting was then followed by Christmas presentations through the holiday season.&lt;ref name="NPSTree2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/whho/historyculture/1954-present-national-christmas-trees.htm |title=1954-present National Christmas Trees |accessdate=2009-01-26 |first=Laura |last=Schiavo |date=n.d. |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Santa Claus==
Rituals surrounding Santa Claus such as [[department store]] visits to the "jolly old elf",&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Clement Clark. "A Visit from St. Nicholas." ''The Sentinel'', (Troy, New York), December 24, 1822.&lt;/ref&gt; and letter writing to his [[North Pole]] workshop remained intact during the post-War era. New to the mix was Santa's Workshop (one of the first theme parks in the US), and NORAD's tracking of Santa's sleigh via radar on Christmas Eve. In [[Cleveland, Ohio]], a costumed character called Mr. Jingeling entertained shoppers annually at Halle's Department Store during the season.

===Santa's Workshop===
[[File:Santa's Workshop - North Pole NY.jpg|thumb|Santa's Workshop at North Pole, New York was one of the first theme parks built in the US (1949).]]

In 1949, one of the first [[theme park]]s in the United States, [[Santa's Workshop (New York amusement park)|Santa's Workshop]], was constructed near [[Whiteface Mountain]] in [[New York State]]. The park was designed by Arto Monaco, of [[Upper Jay, New York]], and built by the site's owner Harold Fortune, of [[Lake Placid, New York]]. The idea for the park originated in a story that [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]] businessman Julian Reiss told his daughter about a baby bear who visits Santa Claus's workshop at the North Pole.&lt;ref name="northpoleny.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northpoleny.com/page.cfm?page=History |title=North Pole: Home of Santa's Workshop: History |accessdate=2009-01-25 |date=n.d. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919004728/http://www.northpoleny.com/page.cfm?page=History |archivedate=September 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park features tame deer, storybook characters, and similar attractions. Single day attendance at the park peaked at 14,000 on September 2, 1951. On December 16, 1953, the [[U.S. Postal Service]] awarded [[North Pole, New York]] status as a "Rural Postal Station". In the same year, the park's Santa Claus and his reindeer participated in the Pageant of Peace in Washington, D.C. as well as [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in New York City. The Nativity Pageant was introduced at the park in 1954.&lt;ref name="northpoleny.com"/&gt;

===NORAD tracking of Santa's journey===
{{Main|NORAD Tracks Santa}}
[[File:Why NORAD Tracks Santa.jpg|thumb|A 1955 [[Sears]] ad with the misprinted telephone number that led to the NORAD Tracks Santa Program.]]
In 1955, an advertisement encouraging children to call Santa Claus over a special [[telephone]] number was printed in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. Due to an error, the phone number that was printed was that of the Continental Air Defense (CONAD). Colonel Harry Shoup was on duty on Christmas Eve 1955 and took many calls from children inquiring about Santa. He told his operators to give a current location for Santa Claus to any child who called in. Three years later, the [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) was formed and the [[NORAD Tracks Santa]] service continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norad.mil/about/Santa.html |title=NORAD Tracks Santa |accessdate=2009-01-25 |work=About NORAD |publisher=NORAD |date=n.d. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224050527/http://www.norad.mil/about/Santa.html |archivedate=2009-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mr. Jingeling===
[[File:Keyes as Jingeling.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Earl W. Keyes.]]

[[Mr. Jingeling]], the Keeper of the Keys to Santa's Workshop, was created in 1956 as a radio spokesman to promote the toys sold at [[Halle's]] Department Store in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrjingeling.com/ |title=Mr. Jingeling: The Keeper of the Keys  |accessdate=2009-01-15 |date=n.d. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Jingeling was immediately popular and became an annual fixture at Halle's where he prowled the seventh floor toy department entertaining shoppers. The costumed character was first played by Max Ellis, a Cleveland Play House actor, and then by Earl W. Keyes, a television producer and director, who remained with the role for many years. In addition to his department store duties, Mr. Jingeling appeared on a local children's television program telling stories, singing songs, and reminding viewers to visit Halle's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lkwdpl.org/lore/lore00.htm |title="Mr. Jingeling" has lifelong love of fantasy |accessdate=2009-01-15 |date=n.d. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521080913/http://www.lkwdpl.org/lore/lore00.htm |archivedate=May 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toys==
[[File:Lars Ridderstedt II &amp; Anna Korn1955.jpg|thumb|Christmas Eve in Batavia, Illinois, 1955.]]

The post-War Christmas toy extravaganza had its seed in [[Clement Clarke Moore]]'s ''[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]''. There, Saint Nicholas is depicted not as the thin, somewhat forbidding, charity dispensing character of European lore but as a dimpled, "jolly old elf" whose stomach shakes like "a bowlful of jelly" when he laughs, and who enters a dwelling through the chimney with a pack of toys on his back.&lt;ref name="Waggoner" /&gt;

In the nineteenth century, Germany was the toy making capitol of the world, but high importation costs made German toys relatively expensive in America. Toy costs were lowered when German toymakers began mass-producing toys under the direction of [[Frank Woolworth]] and shipping their products to Woolworth's warehouses for packaging and distribution.&lt;ref name="Waggoner" /&gt;

[[File:2006-02-04 Metal spiral.jpg|thumb|left|The [[slinky]] was introduced to the Christmas market in November 1945 and remains in production today. The coil-shaped [[toy]] topples down stairs end-over-end.]]

With the loss of German toys on the American market during World War I, toy manufacturing in the United States began in earnest. The [[Great Depression]] was a temporary setback but WWII proved a catalyst. In the aftermath of the war, American couples were eager to settle down, have kids, and lavish the sumptuous Christmases they never had on their offspring.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

The post-War years saw the creation of toys that are still in production today and include ''[[Candy Land]]'', ''[[Cootie (game)|Cootie]]'', the [[hula hoop]], [[Barbie]], and [[Etch A Sketch]].&lt;ref name="Waggoner"&gt;Waggoner, Susan. ''Under the Tree: the Toys and Treats That Made Christmas Special, 1930-1970.'' Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Television cultivated the American Christmas toy extravaganza. Manufacturers sidestepped the parent in selling a toy and went directly to the child.  [[Mr. Potato Head]] was the first toy advertised on television and retail sales topped $4 million in the toy's first year.&lt;ref name="Waggoner" /&gt; [[Play-Doh]]'s sales skyrocketed after being advertised on influential children's television programs such as ''[[Ding Dong School]]'' and ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]''.&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;Walsh, Tim.

==Christmas cards==
The first White House [[Christmas card]] was sent during the administration of Dwight David Eisenhower in 1953. President Eisenhower was an amateur artist and personally consulted with the head of [[Hallmark Cards]] on the project. Over the course of two terms, the Eisenhower White House issued 38 different cards and prints with many of them bearing the President's own artwork. The tradition was continued during the [[Kennedy administration|Kennedy years]] with [[Jacqueline Kennedy]]'s artwork featured on a 1963 card issued to raise funds for a national performing arts center.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

Early in the post-War years, cards exhibited traditional sentiments and art that reassured war weary Americans. As the 1960s neared, however, sophisticated, adult-oriented cards called "Slim Jims" began appearing on the market. The cards displayed Santas driving fin-tailed [[convertible]]s and [[beatnik]]s delivering greetings in hepcat lingo.   The highly stylized cards remained popular well into the 1960s, poking fun at fads and world events. Family photo cards and newsletters (meticulously handwritten or typed by busy moms) became commonplace during the 1960s as well.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

Hallmark brought [[African American]] culture to greeting cards in the 1960s as well as contemporary cultural images such as elves sporting [[Beatles|Beatle]] haircuts and [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] Christmas trees in [[Andy Warhol|Warholesque]] colors.  "Happy Christmas" replaced "Merry Christmas" here and there after clergymen decided the traditional greeting was associated with [[inebriation]]. In 1961, 50 billion Christmas cards were mailed by Americans, and, in 1962, America's first Christmas postage stamp was issued&amp;mdash;causing a mild firestorm by those who felt the stamp violated separation of church and state.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

==Foods==

[http://www.oldetimecooking.com/Recipes/mamie_fudge.htm Mamie Eisenhower's Million-Dollar Fudge Recipe] was a favorite holiday treat of the Eisenhower White House years.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt; and first appeared in ''Who Says We Can't Cook?'', a spiral-bound collection of recipes published in 1955 by the [[Women's National Press Club]] of Washington, D.C. Mamie's husband Ike named the recipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yankeemagazine.com/recipes/search/onerecipe.php?number=1375 |title=Mamie's Million-Dollar Fudge |accessdate=2009-01-13 |publisher=Yankee |date=n.d. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1955 saw the culinary debut of [[Green bean casserole|Green Bean Casserole]], a dish that remains a holiday favorite in America.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2"&gt;Waggoner, Susan. ''It's a Wonderful Christmas: The Best of the Holidays 1940-1965''. Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, 2004. {{ISBN|1-58479-327-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its ingredients include [[green bean]]s, [[cream of mushroom soup]], and, as a topping, [[French's#Products|French's Fried Onions]]. The [[casserole]] was created by [[Campbell Soup Company]] in order to promote its cream soups. [[French's]] reports that 50% of all French's Fried Onions consumption occurs over [[Thanksgiving]], Christmas, and [[Easter]].&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

Cookie cutting and decorating reached its cultural zenith during the boomer years with [[Christmas cookies|Christmas cookie]] cutouts of reindeer, trees, stars, and bells providing sustenance for kids and dads. Moms packed their favorite home baked cookies into [[Tupperware]] containers and carried them to cookie swap parties with friends and neighbors. Red plastic cutters replaced tin cutters during the war years when metal was scarce and can be found today at [[garage sale]]s and [[flea market]]s.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

A snack hit of the 1955 holiday season was [[Chex mix|Chex Party Mix]], a combination of [[Wheat Chex]], [[Rice Chex]], and [[Corn Chex]], nuts, [[pretzel]]s and a dressing of melted butter, [[Worcestershire sauce]], and onion and garlic powders. The treat remains a popular holiday snack.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

==Teenagers==

===Gifts===
[[File:Regency transistor radio.jpg|thumb|upright|The Regency TR-1 transistor radio was put on sale in November 1954.]]

Gifts for teens in the post-War years included face powder, radios, telephones, and cars. In the early 1950s, Angel Face powder was advertised as "the perfect girl-to-girl" Christmas gift.&lt;ref name="Palladino"&gt;Palladino, Grace. ''Teenagers: An American History''. BasicBooks, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[transistor radio]]s hit the market just before Christmas 1954 and were a luxury item at US$49.95 ($322 in 2000 values). A leather case and [[earphone]] cost an additional $11.45 ($73). By the end of the decade however, prices dropped so quickly that an 8-transistor radio could be had for less than $10.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

Another gift in demand was the streamlined, oval-shaped [[Princess telephone]] introduced in the early 1960s. The phone came in a variety of colors, including pink, turquoise, and cream. When one of [[Mattel]]'s [[Barbie]] doll outfits included a Princess phone as an accessory, a fashion trend was born. By 1963, many [[Baby Boomer]]s had reached driver's license age and, for the first time, middle-class families splurged on cars for their offspring.&lt;ref name="Waggoner2" /&gt;

===Films and music===
[[Twentieth Century Fox]]'s 1956 Christmas offering was ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'', a musical film originally intended as a vehicle for [[sex symbol]] [[Jayne Mansfield]], with the [[subplot]] being a [[satire]] of teenagers and [[Rock and roll|rock ‘n’ roll]] music. The unintended result was the "most potent" celebration of rock music ever captured on film.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Norman (author)|Norman, Philip]]. ''John Lennon: The Life''.

Two [[rockabilly]]/rock and roll style songs of the late 1950s became hugely popular. "[[Jingle Bell Rock]]", written by Joe Beal and Jim Boothe, was recorded by [[Bobby Helms]] in 1957. The song is regarded as the first rock and roll Christmas song, and has hit the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] a record six times since its original release. It is second in popularity only to "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]," with 120 million copies sold. "Jingle Bell Rock" hit #6 in its first year, despite having been released only two days before Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/theculture/a/christmas1.htm |title=The Top 40 Christmas Oldies Songs - - #1: A countdown and history of the oldies era's greatest holiday tunes |accessdate=2009-01-26 |first=Robert |last=Fontenot |publisher=About.com |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree]]", written by [[Johnny Marks]] and recorded by [[Brenda Lee]] in 1958 for [[Decca Records]], was another rockabilly/rock and roll flavored Christmas tune. While it was neglected in its first two seasons, the song hit #16 on the Billboard pop chart during the Christmas season of 1960. Eight million copies were sold over thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/theculture/a/christmas3.htm |title=The Top 40 Christmas Oldies Songs - - #3: A countdown and history of the oldies era's greatest holiday tunes |accessdate=2009-01-26 |first=Robert |last=Fontenot |publisher=About.com |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[File:Elvis Presley promoting Jailhouse Rock.jpg|thumb|180px|Elvis Presley released his first Christmas album in 1957, the same year as ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]''.]]

''[[Elvis' Christmas Album]]'' was released in October 1957, the first of only two Christmas albums Elvis recorded. The album featured eight [[Christmas music|Christmas songs]], and four [[gospel music|gospel songs]].  "Santa Claus Is Back In Town" and "Santa Bring My Baby Back (to Me)" were both commissioned expressly for the album. Elvis' reading of [[Ernest Tubb|Ernest Tubb's]] 1949 hit, "[[Blue Christmas (song)|Blue Christmas]]" made the tune a holiday staple.&lt;ref name="Wolfe, Charles p. 4"&gt;Wolfe, Charles. ''Elvis Presley: If Every Day Was Like Christmas'', liner notes, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

His version of "[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]" brought calls from the song's composer [[Irving Berlin]] to have the song, and the entire album, banned from radio airplay. Berlin thought Elvis's rendition a "profane parody of his cherished [[yuletide]] standard".&lt;ref name="Wolfe, Charles p. 4"/&gt; Most US radio stations ignored Berlin's request, though at least one [[disc jockey|DJ]] was fired for playing a tune from the album.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Charles.

"[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]" was composed in 1948 by [[Johnny Marks]] after a 1939 poem by [[Robert L. May (Rudolph)|Robert L. May]] who created Rudolph as part of his employment with [[Montgomery Ward]]. The song tells the story of a [[Santa Claus's reindeer|reindeer]] whose shiny red nose guides Santa's sleigh through the fog on Christmas Eve.  [[Gene Autry]]'s 1949 recording remained at #1 for a week and brought the song widespread fame. Only "White Christmas" has sold more copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/theculture/a/christmas11.htm |title=The Top 40 Christmas Oldies Songs - - #11: A countdown and history of the oldies era's greatest holiday tunes |accessdate=2009-01-26 |first=Robert |last=Fontenot |publisher=About.com |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autry had another hit in 1950 with "[[Frosty the Snowman]]", written by [[Walter E. Rollins|Jack Rollins]] and Steve Nelson as a direct attempt to create a success in the vein of "Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer". The song tells the story of a magical snowman who has playful adventures with children. In 1963, "Frosty" hit its highest position ever at #13 in a version by [[The Ronettes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/theculture/a/christmas20.htm |title=The Top 40 Christmas Oldies Songs - - #20: A countdown and history of the oldies era's greatest holiday tunes |accessdate=2009-01-26 |first=Robert |last=Fontenot |publisher=About.com |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spike Jones]]'s rendition of "[[All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth]]" hit #1 on the pop charts in 1951. The tune was composed in December 1944 by elementary school music teacher [[Don Gardner]] when he noticed most of his students were missing their front "baby" teeth. Inspired, he dashed off the song in thirty minutes. In Spike Jones' original hit recording, a grownup pretends to be a lisping kid who cannot whistle. [[Nat King Cole]] also covered the tune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/theculture/a/christmas36.htm |title=The Top 40 Christmas Oldies Songs - - #36: A countdown and history of the oldies era's greatest holiday tunes |accessdate=2009-01-26 |first=Robert |last=Fontenot |publisher=About.com |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[The Little Drummer Boy]]", based on an ancient [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] folksong, was written by [[Katherine K. Davis]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Boughton, Harrison Charles. ''Katherine K. Davis: life and work''. Thesis, University of Missouri, reprint by University Microfilms. Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  The song tells the [[apocrypha]]l story of a poor young boy who, unable to afford a gift for the infant [[Jesus]], plays his drum with [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]]'s approval. The baby smiles at the boy in gratitude. The 1958 version by the [[Harry Simeone Chorale]] is the standard, and hit the unparalleled record of placing in the [[Top 40]] for five straight Christmases in a row. Simeone recorded the song in a [[Greenwich Village]] cathedral to give it a hushed respect. Its highest position on both the US and UK charts was #13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/theculture/a/christmas21.htm |title=The Top 40 Christmas Oldies Songs - - #21: A countdown and history of the oldies era's greatest holiday tunes |first=Robert |last=Fontenot |publisher=About.com |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eartha Kitt (1952).jpg|thumb|180px|[[Eartha Kitt]] (1952) recorded "[[Santa Baby]]" in 1953.]]

"[[Silver Bells]]" was composed by [[Jay Livingston]] and [[Ray Evans]], introduced by [[Bob Hope]] and [[Marilyn Maxwell]] in the film, ''[[The Lemon Drop Kid]]'' and recorded by [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Carol Richards]] in 1952. The song was inspired by [[Salvation Army]] bellringers and is one of the very few songs about Christmas in the city. The song was originally called "Tinkle Bell", but Livingston's wife reminded him that "tinkle" had another association. "It was something you did in the bathroom," Evans recalled years after the song's composition, "but that's a woman's word and I'd never thought of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Hymns_and_Carols/Notes_On_Carols/silver_bells-notes.htm |title=The Hymns and Carols of Christmas: "Silver Bells" |accessdate=2009-01-27 |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Silver Bells" ranks #13 on [[ASCAP]]'s list of most-played holiday songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5068947 |title=What's in a Song?

"[[I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus]]" was written and composed by [[Tommie Connor]] in 1952 and originally recorded by thirteen-year-old [[Jimmy Boyd]]. The song reached #1 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] charts in [[1952 in music|1952]], and on the ''[[Cash Box Magazine]]'' chart at the beginning of [[1953 in music|the following year]]. Boyd's record was condemned by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Boston]] on the grounds it mixed sex with Christmas. Boyd was widely photographed meeting with the [[Archdiocese]] to explain the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/theculture/a/christmas35.htm |title=The Top 40 Christmas Oldies Songs - - #35: A countdown and history of the oldies era's greatest holiday tunes |accessdate=2009-01-26 |first=Robert |last=Fontenot |publisher=About.com |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Santa Baby]]" was written by Joan Javits and Philip Springer in 1953. The song is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] look at a Christmas list of a woman who wants the most extravagant gifts for the holiday.  "Santa Baby" was originally sung and recorded by [[Eartha Kitt]] and became a huge hit at #4 in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/theculture/a/christmas8.htm |title=The Top 40 Christmas Oldies Songs - - #8: A countdown and history of the oldies era's greatest holiday tunes |accessdate=2009-01-26 |first=Robert |last=Fontenot |publisher=About.com |date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jackson 5 Christmas Album''' was the only holiday album released by Motown family quintet The Jackson 5. Released in October 1970, the album showcased the brothers' harmonies and vocals. Lead singer '''Michael Jackson''' is prominently featured on the album tracks. Included on the Christmas Album is the Jackson 5's hit single version of '''"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town".''' Rendered with a pop-soul feel, the Jackson 5's versions of '''"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"''' and '''"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"''' remain frequent radio requests during the holiday season.

The album spent all four weeks at the number one position on Billboard magazine's special Christmas Albums chart that the magazine published in December 1970, making it the best-selling holiday album of that year. It has sold over '''3.5 million copies worldwide'''.[2]
In 2003, Universal Motown re-released the album with "Little Christmas Tree" (from A Motown Christmas).
In 2009, this configuration was released as Ultimate Christmas Collection with Christmas messages, remixes, and a Christmas medley, and again as Merry Christmas Jackson's. http://www.allmusic.com/album/r9998

==Literature==
[[File:Ted Geisel NYWTS.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Geisel]] (Dr. Seuss), American writer and cartoonist, at work on a drawing of the Grinch for ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]''.]]

In 1957, [[Dr. Seuss]]'s ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' was published by [[Random House]]. The tale's rhyming verse accompanies illustrations by the author, and follows a disagreeable character called the [[Grinch]] and his attempts to thwart the arrival of Christmas by stealing the gifts, trims, and other trappings of the holiday from the happy Whos of [[Whoville]]. In spite of his attempts, Christmas arrives all the same.&lt;ref name="Nel, Philip 2005"&gt;Nel, Philip. ''Dr. Seuss''. Continuum, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grinch realizes then that Christmas is something more than its trappings. The book criticizes the commercialization of Christmas and satirizes those who exploit the holiday.&lt;ref name="Nel, Philip 2005"/&gt; The tale was adapted into a 1966 [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|short animated film]] for television with a [[screenplay]] by Seuss and narration by [[Boris Karloff]]. Later adaptations include a [[Broadway musical]] and a [[Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000 film)|feature film]] in 2000 starring [[Jim Carrey]].

At 100 years of age in 1960,  [[Grandma Moses]] illustrated Clement Clark Moore's Christmas poem, ''[[A Visit from Saint Nicholas]]'' as ''The Night Before Christmas'' for [[Random House]]. The book was published after her death in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/all/informationong_ooc.htm |title=Information on Grandma Moses, American folk artist |accessdate=2009-02-01 |publisher=essortment.com |date=n.d. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327080641/http://www.essortment.com/all/informationong_ooc.htm |archivedate=2009-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The years immediately following WWII saw the release of two of the most popular Christmas films in US history: ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946) and ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'' (1947). [[Moviefone]] listed the two movies as number two and three respectively in their "25 Best Christmas Movies of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;Number one was ''[[A Christmas Story]]'' (1983); {{cite web|url=http://movies.aol.com/holiday-movies/best-christmas-movies|title=The 25 Best Christmas Movies of All Time|publisher=[[Moviefone]]|accessdate=2009-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' of London, in a similar ranking, had the two in tenth and eight respectively, while placing fourth 1942's ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'', the movie that launched Bing Crosby's ''White Christmas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article5318542.ece?token=null&amp;offset=12&amp;page=2|title=Crackers!

''[[Santa Claus Conquers the Martians]]'' (1964) regularly appears on lists of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films ever made]]. Paul Jacobson, the film's producer and a former unit manager for the television program, ''[[Howdy Doody]]'', described his film as a "Yuletide science fiction fantasy", and with the best of intentions, hoped to bring something to movie theaters at a time of the year when there was a paucity of children's entertainment other than the annual Disney feature.&lt;ref name="Crouse, Richard 2003"&gt;Crouse, Richard. ''The 100 Best Movies You've Never Seen''. ECW Press, 2003. {{ISBN|1-55022-590-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jacobson's film, [[Martians]] kidnap Santa Claus in a plan to bring fun to their listless, TV-obsessed children. Once on Mars, Santa mass-produces toys using a computerized machine, foils a sourpuss saboteur, and generates fun for all. ''Santa Claus Conquers the Martians'' has been novelized, adapted to musical stagings, and has taken its place as a holiday [[cult film|cult classic]].&lt;ref name="Crouse, Richard 2003"/&gt; Child actress [[Pia Zadora]] played one of the Martian children and years later commented, "It was very well done, considering it was shot twenty years ago - gimme a break - and really is very entertaining. It's become a Christmas classic, really."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Frederick S..''Cinefantastique''. F. S. Clarke, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==
[[File:Amahl 1951.jpg|thumb|[[Kurt Yaghjian]] as Amahl offers his crutch to the Magi as a gift to the Christ Child in the final moments of the 1963 video presentation of the opera.]]

Christmas television is predominantly secular and focuses on the ethical message of generosity through gift giving and Santa Claus, or the psychological message of home, nostalgia and childhood, or both. The theological message of the holiday&amp;mdash;the [[Incarnation]]&amp;mdash;is rarely encountered in Christmas television. Such a message would be inaccessible to many Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Nathanson, Paul. ''Over the Rainbow: The Wizard of Oz as a Secular Myth of America''. SUNY Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-7914-0709-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, [[Gian Carlo Menotti]] was commissioned by [[NBC]]'s ''Opera Theatre'' to write an opera for television. After a year and a half of delay, he set to work, completing ''[[Amahl and the Night Visitors]]'' five days before its scheduled airing on Christmas Eve 1951 at 9:30 to 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.. Menotti's work was inspired by [[Hieronymous Bosch]]'s painting, ''The Adoration of the Magi''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quaintance Eaton|Eaton, Quaintance]]. ''Opera Production: A Handbook''. University of Minnesota Press, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; The composer himself appeared on-screen to introduce the opera and give the background of the events leading up to its composition. He also brought director [[Kirk Browning]] and conductor [[Thomas Schippers]] on-camera to thank them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paleycenter.org/collection/item/?q=Amahl+and+the+Night+Visitors+&amp;p=1&amp;item=T:62883 |title=Hallmark Hall of Fame: Amahl and the Night Visitors (series premiere) |publisher=The Paley Center for Media |accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated five million viewers tuned in&amp;mdash;to this day, the largest audience for a televised opera in America. Skeptic [[Olin Downes]] declared in a ''[[New York Times]]'' front page review that "television, operatically speaking, has come of age" and ''[[Newsweek]]'' called the telecast, "the best production of opera yet seen on TV."&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;Rose, Brian Geoffrey. ''Television and the Performing Arts''. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1986. pp. 138&amp;ndash;140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera's appeal lay not only in its story about a crippled shepherd boy healed on the first Christmas Eve but in its wedding of opera and the limitations of television. The broad effects of theater were eschewed and instead an intimacy appropriate to the television studio and home viewing was cultivated. The production starred Chet Allen as Amahl and Rosemary Kuhlmann as his mother. Kuhlmann reprised her role annually for many years.&lt;ref name="Rose" /&gt;

[[File:Early 1950s Television Set Eugene Oregon.jpg|thumb|A television set circa 1953.]]

In 1953, ''Amahl'' was colorcast.&lt;ref&gt;Hawes, William. ''Filmed Television Drama, 1952-1958''. McFarlnad, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The opera claims the distinctions of being the first opera written for television, the first presentation of the teleseries ''[[Hallmark Hall of Fame]]'', and the first Christmas television special to become an annual tradition. The opera was telecast on NBC from 1951 to 1966 with many of the original cast and crew participating.&lt;ref name="Rose" /&gt;

On December 6, 1964, NBC aired ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red–Nosed Reindeer]]'', a [[stop motion]] animated special produced by [[Rankin/Bass]]. The special was based on a 1949 [[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|song]] by [[Johnny Marks]], which was based in turn on a 1939 [[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer|poem]] by [[Robert L.

==Christmas clubs==
[[File:Bank Club Ad 03.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement for a bank Christmas club that doubled as a tree ornament, ca. 1950]]

[[Christmas club]]s were [[saving (money)|savings]] programs first offered by [[bank]]s in 1909. The concept was simple: bank customers deposited a set amount of money each week into a special [[savings account]], and received the money at a later date for [[Christmas]] shopping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2002/11/18/focus2.html |first=Barbara |last=Pinckney|title=Holiday clubs endure despite waning popularity |accessdate=2009-01-25 |date=2002-11-15 |publisher=The Business Review (Albany)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The December 23, 1949 episode of ''[[The Life of Riley|Life of Riley]]'' saw the show's protagonist Chester Riley attempting to withdraw his US$2 Christmas club money but discovering his account has accumulated a variety of fees including one for the passbook, another for early withdrawal, and yet another for the bank's mailed reminders. The luckless Riley owes the bank 25 cents.

'''The Committee to Boycott Nixon's Memoirs''' was an organization founded to protest the release of ''RN'', the memoirs of former United States president [[Richard Nixon]]. A group of 19 people led by carpet cleaner Tom Flanigan and restaurateur Bill Boleyn gathered money and produced T-shirts, bumper stickers, and buttons with the slogan "Don't Buy Books By Crooks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19780428&amp;id=sW9NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BPsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5637,7899044|title='Don't Buy Books by Crooks'|last=McGory |first=Mary |date=April 28, 1978 |newspaper=Lakeland Ledger |access-date=October 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign's newspaper ads were turned down by the ''New York Times'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]'', but they did get media attention, including their shirt being seen on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/books/review/Fehrman-t.html|last=Fehrman|first=Craig|title=All the President’s Memories|date=November 4, 2010|newspaper=[[New York Times]] |access-date=October 19, 2015 }}

[[Concussion]]s, a type of [[traumatic brain injury]], are a frequent concern for those playing [[sport]]s, from children and teenagers to professional athletes. Repeated concussions are a known cause of various [[neurological disorder]]s, most notably [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), which in professional athletes has led to premature retirement, erratic behavior and even [[suicide]].  Because concussions cannot be seen on X-rays or CT scans, attempts to prevent concussions have been difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/concussion/basics/tests-diagnosis/con-20019272|title=Concussion Tests and diagnosis|author=Mayo Clinic Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dangers of repeated concussions have long been known for [[boxing|boxers]] and [[wrestling|wrestlers]]; a form of CTE common in these two sports, [[dementia pugilistica]] (DP), was first described in 1928. An awareness of the risks of concussions in other sports began to grow in the 1990s, and especially in the mid-2000s, in both the medical and the professional sports communities, as a result of studies of the brains of prematurely deceased [[American football]] players, who showed extremely high incidences of CTE (see [[concussions in American football]]).

As of 2012, the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|four major professional sports leagues]] in the United States and Canada have concussion policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/topics/_/page/concussions |title=Concussions in sports - NFL Topics - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports-related concussions are generally analyzed by athletic training or medical staff on the sidelines using an evaluation tool for cognitive function known as the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT), a symptom severity checklist, and a [[Balance (ability)|balance]] test.&lt;ref name="Harmon, K. G. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Harmon K. G. |author2=Drezner J. A. |author3=Gammons M. |author4=Guskiewicz K. M. |author5=Halstead M. |author6=Herring S. A. |author7=Roberts W.

==Dangers==
Concussion symptoms can last for an undetermined amount of time depending on the player and the severity of the concussion. A concussion will affect the way a person's brain works. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite If not properly taken care of the concussion can lead to having side effects to the brain. This side effects can be anything from a continuous headache to losing memory faster than usually.  web|last=Wedro|first=Benjamin|title=Concussion|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/brain_concussion/article.htm|work=MedicineNet|accessdate=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is the potential of post-concussion syndrome, defined as a set of symptoms that may continue after a concussion is sustained.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Post-concussion symptoms can be classified into physical, cognitive, emotional, and sleep symptoms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Physical symptoms include a headache, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Athletes may experience cognitive symptoms that include speaking slowly, difficulty remembering and concentrating.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Emotional and sleep symptoms include irritability, sadness, drowsiness, and trouble falling asleep.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/s12245-014-0031-6 |title=Who gets post-concussion syndrome? An emergency department-based prospective analysis |journal=International Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=7 |year=2014 |last1=Ganti |first1=Latha |last2=Khalid |first2=Hussain |last3=Patel |first3=Pratik Shashikant |last4=Daneshvar |first4=Yasamin |last5=Bodhit |first5=Aakash N |last6=Peters |first6=Keith R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the classification of post-concussion symptoms, the symptoms can also be described as immediate and delayed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The immediate symptoms are experienced immediately after a concussion such as: memory loss, disorientation, and poor balance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Delayed symptoms are experienced in the later stages and include sleeping disorders and behavioral changes. Both immediate and delayed symptoms can continue for long periods of time and have a negative impact on recovery.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to research, 20-25% of individuals who have sustained a concussion experienced chronic, delayed symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1123/ijatt.16.5.5 |title=The Neurophysiology Behind Concussion Signs and Symptoms |journal=International Journal of Athletic Therapy and Training |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=5–9 |year=2011 |last1=Livingston |first1=Scott C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing through concussion makes people more vulnerable to getting hit again, and that is why most sports have test that trainers will perform to prevent getting hit a second time. A second blow can cause a rare condition known as [[second-impact syndrome]], which can result in severe injury or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19561758 |pmc=2672291 |year=2009 |author1=Bey |first1=T |title=Second impact syndrome |journal=The western journal of emergency medicine |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=6–10 |last2=Ostick |first2=B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Second-impact syndrome is when an athlete suffers a second head injury before the brain has adequate time to heal in between concussions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/jlme.12126 |pmid=25040374 |title=Causes and Consequences of Sports Concussion |journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=128–32 |year=2014 |last1=Edwards |first1=Jonathan C |last2=Bodle |first2=Jeffrey D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repeated concussions have been linked to a variety of neurological disorders among athletes, including CTE, [[Alzheimer's Disease]], [[Parkinsonism]] and [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS).&lt;ref name=cantuCTE&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cantu RC |title=[[Chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] in the National Football League |journal=Neurosurgery |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=223–5 |year=2007 |pmid=17762733 |doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000255514.73967.90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16385332 |year=2006 |author1=Pellman |first1=E.

A study has been done on players who are deceased in the NFL and 99% of the of the scans done on the brains show that they had CTE. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/16/news/companies/vicis-nfl-helmet-concussions-safety/index.html|title=Flexible NFL helmet aims to reduce head injuries|last=Garcia|first=Ahiza|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depression is often a common cause from a traumatic brain injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/6901/|title=EVALUATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEPRESSION, COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOLLOWING TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE CHRONIC CARE MODEL|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence==
It is estimated that as many as 1.6-3.8 million concussions occur in the US per year in competitive sports and recreational activities; this is a rough estimate, since as many as 50% of concussions go unreported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bjsports-2012-091941 |pmid=23243113 |title=American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: Concussion in sport |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=15–26 |year=2013 |last1=Harmon |first1=Kimberly G |last2=Drezner |first2=Jonathan A |last3=Gammons |first3=Matthew |last4=Guskiewicz |first4=Kevin M |last5=Halstead |first5=Mark |last6=Herring |first6=Stanley A |last7=Kutcher |first7=Jeffrey S |last8=Pana |first8=Andrea |last9=Putukian |first9=Margot |last10=Roberts |first10=William O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concussions occur in all sports with the highest incidence in American football, hockey, rugby, soccer, and basketball.&lt;ref name="Harmon, K.

[[Major League Baseball]]'s policy was first started in 2007, and injured players are examined by a team athletic trainer on the field.&lt;ref name=USAToday&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/2011-04-12-nba-concussions_N.htm |title=Concussions now a hot issue as leagues toughen policies |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date= 2011-10-25|accessdate=2012-06-30 |first1=Erik |last1=Brady |first2=J. Michael |last2=Falgoust}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 29, 2011, MLB and the [[Major League Baseball Players Association]] announced that they have created various protocols for the league's concussion policy. The new policy includes four primary components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephania BellFantasy SportsFollowArchive |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/fantasy/baseball/flb/story?id=6280590 |title=7-day DL, return-to-play protocols part of MLB's new concussion policy - Fantasy Baseball - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* All teams are to run baseline neurocognitive testing for all players and umpires using the ImPACT (Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing) system during spring training or after a player signing.&lt;ref name=USATodayMLB&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/dailypitch/post/2011/03/baseball-new-concussion-policy-seven-day-disabled-list/1 |title=Baseball establishes seven-day DL in concussion policy |publisher=Content.usatoday.com |date=2011-03-30 |accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The SCAT2 (Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, version 2) has been adopted as the official sideline concussion assessment tool of the league, even though various teams have already adopted this tool.
* The establishment of the 7-day disabled list for players with concussions. Players who have been on the list for 14 days are to be transferred to the 15-day list.&lt;ref name=USATodayMLB /&gt;
* Any player who has been diagnosed with a concussion, regardless of being placed on the disabled list, must have his team submit a return-to-play form to the league's medical director to in order for that player to be cleared to play.

===National Basketball Association===
The [[National Basketball Association]] does not have a policy, and team procedures after concussions vary by team.&lt;ref name=USAToday /&gt; The NBA has a meeting to educate the players each year about concussions. Players also go through a neurological and cognitive assessment after each season.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nba.com/official/concussion_policy_summary.html{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Game 2 of the 2016 NBA Finals on June 5, 2016, [[Kevin Love]] was placed in the NBA Concussion Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxsports.com/nba/video?vid=699539523883{{full citation needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Football League===
{{main|Concussions in American football}}
The [[National Football League]]'s policy was first started in 2007, and injured players are examined on field by the medical team.&lt;ref name=USAToday /&gt; The league's policy included the "NFL Sidelines Concussion Exam", which requires players who have taken [[Helmet-to-helmet collision|hits to the head]] to perform tests concerning concentration, thinking and balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/02/25/new-nfl-concussion-policy-waiting-on-approval/ |title=NFL to require sideline test after head blows – - CNN.com Blogs |publisher=Thechart.blogs.cnn.com |date= 2011-02-25|accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the league introduced an assessment test, which combines a symptoms checklist, a limited neurological examination, a cognitive evaluation, and a balance assessment. For a player to be allowed to return, he must be [[asymptomatic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/Cutler-on-mend-after-suffering-concussion/d1f132de-7d46-45fc-b7eb-e06e36482121|title=Cutler on mend after suffering concussion|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=2012-11-12|accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a player is cleared by the Unaffiliated Neurotrauma Consultant (UNC), then they will be allowed to play but will be monitored closely throughout the game. If a player is diagnosed with a concussion, then that player is not allowed back in the game. A return to play process is issued, which includes five steps, “1. Rest and recovery 2. Light aerobic exercise 3. Continued aerobic exercise/strength training 4. Football specific activities 5. Full football activity/clearance”   &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2016/9/18/12940926/nfl-concussion-protocol-explained|title=How does the NFL's concussion protocol work?|work=SBNation.com|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost every team has experienced a player who will “keep playing, then manage to stumble off the field, unnoticed by the coaches, cameras or press. He might take a breather for a series or two. But he can walk, so he wants to play. He gets back in the game and back to his teammates.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828775853|title=Fourth down and inches : concussions and football's make-or-break moment|last=1958-|first=McClafferty, Carla Killough,|isbn=9781467710671|location=Minneapolis|oclc=828775853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Johns Hopkins University, a study took place which “researchers recruited nine former NFL players who retired decades ago and who ranged in age from 57 to 74. The men had played a variety of positions and self-reported a wide range of concussions, varying from none for a running back to 40 for a defensive tackle." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hub.jhu.edu/2015/01/26/nfl-players-concussion-research/.|title=Johns Hopkins study of retired NFL players sheds light on concussion-related brain damage|date=2015-01-26|work=The Hub|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Hockey League===
The [[National Hockey League]]'s concussion policy began in 1997, and players who sustain concussions are evaluated by a team doctor in a quiet room.&lt;ref name=USAToday /&gt; In March 2011, the NHL adopted guidelines for the league's concussion policy. Before the adoptions, examinations on the bench for concussions was the minimum requirement, but the new guidelines make it mandatory for players showing concussion-like symptoms to be examined by a doctor in the locker room.&lt;ref name=ESPNNHL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=6411004 |title=NHL commissioner Gary Bettman pleased with league's concussion protocol - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2011-04-23 |accessdate=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Paul Echlin and Dr. Martha Shenton of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and other researchers, conducted a study where “Forty-five male and female Canadian university hockey players were observed by independent physicians during the 2011-12 season. All 45 players were given M.R.I. scans before and after the season. The 11 who received a concussion diagnosis during the season were given additional scans within 72 hours, two weeks and two months of the incident. The scans found microscopic white matter and inflammatory changes in the brains of individuals who had sustained a clinically diagnosed concussion during the period of the study.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/sports/hockey/study-finds-changes-in-brains-of-hockey-players-who-had-concussions.html|title=Study Finds Changes in Brains of Hockey Players Who Had Concussions|last=Klein|first=Jeff Z.|date=2014-02-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many children and teenagers participate in sports and [[Extracurricular activity|extracurricular activities]] that create a risk of a head injury or concussion, including basketball, cheerleading, soccer, and football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=28739314 |year=2017 |author1=Kerr |first1=Z.

In 2010, more high school soccer players suffered concussions than basketball, baseball, wrestling, and softball players combined, according to the Center for Injury Research and Policy.&lt;ref&gt;Cantu, Robert C., and Mark Hyman. "Soccer." ''Concussions and Our Kids: America's Leading Expert on How to Protect Young Athletes and Keep Sports Safe''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2012. 40+. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study in the ''[[JAMA Pediatrics]]'' medical journal, many girls do not get necessary care and prevention regarding concussions, and 56 percent of players (or their families) reporting concussion symptoms never sought treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, Bob. "Study Reveals Many Girls Soccer Players Stay On Field Despite Concussions." ''Forbes''. Forbes Magazine, 21 Jan. 2014. Web. 06 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing topic is concussions in girls' soccer, predominantly among high-school girls. Studies show that girls are reporting nearly twice as many concussions as boys in the sports that they both play. The number of girls suffering concussions in soccer accounts for the second largest amount of all concussions reported by young athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Kate, Sarah Koch, Deirdre Cohen, and Jessica Hopper. "[http://rockcenter.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/05/09/11604307-concussion-crisis-growing-in-girls-soccer?lite Concussion Crisis Growing in Girls' Soccer]." NBC News. NBC, 9 May 2012. Web. 16 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 study published by [[ScienceDirect]], soccer has the highest injury rate per athlete-exposure among 7- to 13-year-old children.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, Michael L., Aimen S. Kasasbeh, Lissa C. Baird, Chiazo Amene, Jeff Skeen, and Larry Marshall. "Concussions in Soccer: A Current Understanding." [[Science Direct]], Nov. 2012. Web. 12 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

This study was performed to compare the clinical recovery patterns after sport-related concussions for high school and collegiate athletes.  It was important for them that these findings help us get a better understanding of how developmental factors influence the response to and recovery after different levels of play. Determining if college or professional athletes are more resilient to concussive injury on average than more heterogeneous high school samples.

The study was performed with Division 1, 2, and 3 football players at 15 universities across the United States. Then there was project sideline that followed football, hockey, and soccer players in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They also looked at male and female high school and collegiate athletes mostly in southeaster United States.  For every athlete they did a preseason baseline testing to see if anyone had a concussion already.  They conducted these tests in the athletes’ schools in classrooms or other quiet indoor settings. All the athletes were individually proctored by the trained research assistants.

From this study they concluded that the collegiate athletes were older, taller, and heavier and have played their sport for more years then the high school athletes have. The high school group had more concussions and a higher proportion of females then the collegiate or control samples did. They had a total of 621 concussed athletes and 150 non-injured controls. They found little evidence that there were different rates of clinical recovery from the concussions between the high school students and the collegiate athletes. They saw that for the collegiate players that the elevated symptoms through day 5 of post-injury resolved by day 7. The high school athletes took 1–2 days longer to recover, but they both showed rapid recovery within the few days of the injury. The high school athletes did have more severe concussions though.

The information that the authors give us are relevant to only people who play sports at the high school or college level. This information would not benefit someone who does not play sports or does not get concussions often. They were testing to see what the effect of the concussions had on these athletes and how they recovered from them. This information could also be good for coaches and parents to know as well.

Limitations they could have had for this experiment would be if the majority of the team’s players were injured or if none of them have ever had concussions or no one got concussions from their sports. I don’t think there was any data missing that they didn’t tell us about in their report. Other limitations that may have existed in this study was if a player already had a concussion and continued to play contact sports and did not let it heal that would be disrupting their data that they are looking for.

===American football===
{{main|Concussions in American football}}
American football causes 250,000 concussions annually, and 20% of high-school football players experience a concussion every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KoeRrA_-td0C&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=250%2C000%20injuries%20reported%20annually%20in%20football%20players&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=ACSM's Primary Care Sports Medicine|last=McKeag|first=Douglas|last2=Moeller|first2=James L.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=|isbn=9780781770286|location=|pages=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=SMH |url=http://www.hughston.com/hha/a_12_2_3.htm |title=Sport-Related Concussion |publisher=Hughston.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206145042/http://www.hughston.com/hha/a_12_2_3.htm |archivedate=2013-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, researchers from the Sports Medicine Research Laboratory at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] analyzed 17,549 players from 242 different schools. 888 (5.1%) of the players analyzed have at least one concussion a season, and 131 (14.7%) of them have had another concussion the year later. [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] and high-school players have a higher tendency to sustain a concussion than [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] and [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/concuss.html |title=Neuroscience for Kids - Football Concussions |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In {{NFL Year|2001}}, the [[National Football League Players Association]] partnered with the UNC to determine whether professional football players suffer any health effects after any injuries, although the findings were criticized by the NFL for being unreliable due to being based on self-reporting by the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hadhazy |first=Adam |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=football-concussions-felt-long-after-retirement |title=Concussions Exact Toll on Football Players Long After They Retire |publisher=Scientific American |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Association football===
[[Association football]]— also known as soccer— is a major source of sports-related concussions around the world. Even though 50-80% of injuries in football are directed to the legs, head injuries have been shown to account for between 4 and 22% of football injuries. There is the possibility that heading the ball could damage the head, as the ball can travel at 100&amp;nbsp;km/hour; although most professional footballers have reported that they experienced head injuries from colliding with other players and the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/soccer.html |title=Neuroscience for Kids - Soccer |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mozes|first1=Alan|title=Banning Soccer 'Headers' Won't Solve Concussion Problem: Study|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2015/07/13/banning-soccer-headers-wont-solve-concussion-problem-study|website=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]|accessdate=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A multi-year study by the University of Colorado published in ''[[JAMA Pediatrics]]'' confirmed that athlete-to-athlete collisions that occur during heading, not impact with the ball itself, is generally the cause for concussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seaman|first1=Andrew|title='Heading' bans in soccer may not be enough to stop concussions|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/13/us-health-kids-concussions-soccer-idUSKCN0PN1UM20150713|accessdate=13 July 2015|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=13 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Norway|Norwegian]] study consisting of current and former players of the [[Norway national football team]] found out that 3% of the active and 30% of the former players had persistent symptoms of concussions, and that 35% of the active and 32% of that former players had abnormal [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2165/00007256-199214030-00006 |pmid=1439395 |title=Head and Neck Injuries in Soccer |journal=Sports Medicine |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=200–13 |year=1992 |last1=Tysvaer |first1=Alf Thorvald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2006-07 FA Premier League|2006-07 English Premier League season]], [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Football goalkeeper|goalkeeper]] [[Petr Čech]] suffered from a severe concussion in a match between his club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. During the match, Reading [[midfielder]] [[Stephen Hunt (footballer born 1981)|Stephen Hunt]] hit Čech's head with his right knee, knocking the keeper out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=14 October 2006 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/6052028.stm | title=Mourinho angry as keepers injured |work=[[BBC Sport]] | accessdate=16 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čech underwent surgery for a [[depressed skull fracture]] and was told that he would miss a year of playing football. Čech resumed his goalkeeper duties on January 20, 2007 in a match against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], now wearing a [[Scrum cap|rugby helmet]] to protect his weakened skull.

According to Downs DS and D Abwender in their article Neuropsychological Impairment in Soccer Athletes, “participation in soccer may be associated with poorer neuropsychological performance, although the observed pattern of findings does not specifically implicate heading as the cause”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Neuropsychological Impairment in Soccer Athletes."|last=Downs|first=DS and D Abwender|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 2013 in a match between [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], Tottenham goal keeper [[Hugo Lloris]] sustained a blow to the head by on -coming player [[Romelu Lukaku]]'s knee. The blow left Lloris knocked out on the ground. Reluctantly manager [[Andre Villas Boas]] decided to leave the player on after regaining consciousness and having passed a medical assessment. This broke the rules of the [[Professional Footballers' Association|PFA]], which state that any player who has lost consciousness must be substituted.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/04/concussion-rules-hugo-lloris-tottenham | title=Concussion Rules under Spotlight in Wake of Hugo Lloris Row | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=November 4, 2013 | accessdate=March 21, 2016 | author=Gibson, Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been a widespread debate on protective head gear in soccer. Known as a sport associated with intricate footwork, speed, and well-timed passes, soccer also is classified as a high- to moderate-intensity contact/collision sport, with rates of head injury and concussion similar to those seen in football, ice hockey, lacrosse, and rugby. While the benefits of helmets and other head protection are more obvious in the latter sports, the role of headgear in soccer is still unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Malonie, Jamie, Linda Nield, and Matthew Livley. "Can Headgear Halt Soccer Concussions?" ''Consultant For Paediatricians'', July 2013. Web. 04 Mar. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

There are clear rules from FIFA regarding what to do when a player gets a concussion. FIFA's guidelines say that a player who has been knocked unconscious should not play again that day. The rules do however allow for "a transient alteration of conscious level" following a head injury, which says that a player can return to play following assessment by medical staff. The rules also state that a player who is injured with head damage is not to be played for five days.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

===Auto racing===
The [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|death]] of [[Dale Earnhardt]] at the [[2001 Daytona 500]], along with those of [[Kenny Irwin]], [[Adam Petty]] and [[Tony Roper (racing driver)|Tony Roper]] in 2000, and serious injuries sustained by [[Steve Park]] in a wreck in September 2001 at [[Darlington Raceway|Darlington]], led to NASCAR establishing numerous policies to assist in driver safety, such as the introduction of the [[Car of Tomorrow]]. Drivers were eventually instructed to wear both head and neck restraints, and [[SAFER barrier]]s have been installed on racetrack walls, with foam-padded supports on each side of the helmet that would allow a driver's head to move in the event of a crash. Despite this, 29 identified concussions occurred between [[2004 in NASCAR|2004]] and [[2012 in NASCAR|2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/racing/news/20120221/nascar-concussions/ |title=NASCAR drivers have concussion concerns - Racing - SI.com |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2012-02-21 |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite [[boxing]]'s violent nature, a [[National Safety Council]] report in 1996 ranked amateur boxing as the safest contact sport in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxing.isport.com/boxing-guides/concussions-in-boxing |title=Concussions in Boxing &amp;#124; iSport.com |publisher=Boxing.isport.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, concussions are one of the most serious injuries that can occur from boxing, and in an 80-year span from 1918 to 1998, there were 659 boxers who died from brain injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/story/health/story/2011-08-29/Pediatricians-urge-parents-to-keep-kids-away-from-boxing-ring-head-injuries/50177078/1 |title=– |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidence rates for concussion in boxing may frequently be miscalculated due to the fact that concussions do not always result from a knockout blow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/0269905031000088869 |pmid=12963556 |title=Incidence of concussion in contact sports: A systematic review of the evidence |journal=Brain Injury |volume=17 |issue=10 |pages=901–17 |year=2009 |last1=Koh |first1=Jae O |last2=Cassidy |first2=J. David |last3=Watkinson |first3=E. Jane }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Olympic boxers deliver punches with high impact velocity but lower HIC and translational acceleration than in football impacts because of a lower effective punch mass. They cause proportionately more rotational acceleration than in football. Modeling shows that the greatest strain is in the midbrain late in the exposure, after the primary impact acceleration in boxing and football.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Worldwide, boxing is talked about and watched in many countries and one of the most televised sports and one of the most famous boxer of all time is Muhammad Ali. He was one of the most influential boxers and known as the best of all time. Ali unfortunately was “diagnosed with “a cluster of symptoms that resemble Parkinson’s Disease,” known as Parkinson’s Syndrome, which his doctor believed were caused by numerous blows to the head,” which led to his death in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/sports/muhammad-ali-brain-damage-explored-new-book/.|title=Boxing Great Muhammad Ali's 'Sad Decline' from Brain Damage Explored in New Biography|work=PEOPLE.com|access-date=2018-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gymnastics ===
As many skills as gymnastics involve flipping or a blind landing, incidence of head injury increases. A 15-year study found an incidence of 1.7% for concussion and closed head injury for high school gymnasts.&lt;ref name="Daneshvar 1–17"/&gt;

===Ice hockey===
[[Ice hockey]] has also been known to have concussions inflict numerous players. Because of this, the NHL made [[hockey helmet]]s mandatory in the [[1979–80 NHL season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stubbs |first=Dave |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/sports/Dave+Stubbs+Pacioretty+richly+deserves+Masterton+trophy/6801101/story.html |title=Dave Stubbs: Max Pacioretty richly deserves Masterton trophy |publisher=Montrealgazette.com |date=2012-06-19 |accessdate=2012-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a data release by the National Academy of [[Neuropsychology]]'s Sports Concussion Symposium, from 2006 to 2011, 765 NHL players were diagnosed with a concussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/3039-bigger-hockey-players-causing-concussions.html |title=Bigger Hockey Players Causing More Concussions |publisher=LiveScience |date=2008-11-10 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Mayo Clinic Sports Medicine Center Ice Hockey Summit: Action on Concussion conference in 2010, a panel made a recommendation that blows to the head are to be prohibited, and to outlaw [[checking (ice hockey)|body checking]] by 11- and 12-year-olds. For the [[2010–11 NHL season]], the NHL prohibited blindside hits to the head, but did not ban hits to the face. The conference also urged the NHL and its minor entities to join the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]], the [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship|NCAA]] and the [[Ontario Hockey League]] in banning any contact to the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klein |first=Jeff |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/sports/hockey/21concussions.html |title=Hockey Urged to Ban All Blows to Head by Concussions Panel |date=2010-10-20 |accessdate= |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHL has been criticized for allowing team doctors to determine whether an injured player can return to the ice, instead of independent doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Proteau|first=Adam|title=NHL Can Do More To Prevent Concussions|url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/50296-NHL-can-do-more-to-prevent-concussions.html|work=The Hockey News|accessdate=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rugby union===
{{main|Concussions in rugby union}}
Concussions are also a significant factor in [[rugby union]], another full-contact sport. In 2011, the sport's world governing body, [[World Rugby]] (then known as the International Rugby Board, or IRB), issued a highly detailed policy for dealing with injured players with suspected concussions. Under the policy, a player suffering from a suspected concussion is not allowed to return to play in that game. Players are not cleared to play after the injury for a minimum of 21 days, unless they are being supervised in their recovery by a medical practitioner. Even when medical advice is present, players must complete a multi-step monitoring process before being cleared to play again; this process requires a minimum of six days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irbplayerwelfare.com/?documentid=3 |title=IRB Concussion Guidelines |publisher=International Rugby Board |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the IRB modified the policy, instituting a Pitchside Suspected Concussion Assessment (PSCA), under which players suspected of having suffered concussions are to leave the field for 5&amp;nbsp;minutes while doctors assess their condition via a series of questions. Players who pass the PSCA are allowed to return to play.&lt;ref name="Lamont July 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/scotland/rugby/story/192179.html |title=Lamont: Players are cheating concussion tests |publisher=''ESPN Scrum'' |date=27 July 2013 |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, an incident during the third Test of the [[2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia|2013 Lions tour of Australia]] led to criticism of the current protocols. During that match, Australian [[George Smith (rugby union)|George Smith]] clashed heads with the Lions' [[Richard Hibbard]] and was sent to pitchside. According to ESPN's [[ESPN (UK)|UK channel]], "despite looking dazed and confused, Smith passed the PSCA and was back on the field minutes later."&lt;ref name="Lamont July 2013"/&gt;

In 2013, former [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] international [[Rory Lamont]] charged that the current concussion protocols can easily be manipulated. A key part of the current protocols is the "Cogsport" test (also known as COG), a computer-based test of cognitive function. Each player undergoes the test before the start of a new season, and is then tested again on it after a head injury, and the results compared, to determine possible impairment. According to Lamont, some players deliberately do poorly on the pre-season test, so that they will be more likely to match or beat their previous results during play.&lt;ref name="Lamont December 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/208943.html |title='Players are deliberately cheating concussion tests' |first=Rory |last=Lamont |authorlink=Rory Lamont |publisher=''ESPN Scrum'' |date=19 December 2013 |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamont was also critical of the PSCA, noting:
{{cquote|The problem with the PSCA is a concussed player can pass the assessment. I know from first hand experience it can be quite ineffective in deciding if a player is concussed. It is argued that allowing the five-minutes assessment is better than zero minutes but it is not as clear cut as one might hope. Concussion symptoms regularly take 10 minutes or longer to actually present. Consequently the five-minute PSCA may be giving concussed players a license to return to the field.&lt;ref name="Lamont December 2013"/&gt;}}
The Concussion bin was replaced by the head bin in 2012 with the players assessment taking 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rugby is still holding the concussion bomb with tongs in spite of warnings|url=http://m.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/vincent-hogan/rugby-is-still-holding-the-concussion-bomb-with-tongs-in-spite-of-warnings-30952483.html|publisher=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If concussed the player must then recover by first returning to general activities in life, then progressing back to playing. Returning to play, the player must follow the Graduated Return to Play (GRTP) protocol, by having clearance from a medical professional, and no symptoms of concussion.

==Female sports==
Numerous reports have indicated that [[women's sports|female athletes]] suffer more concussions than male athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Girls, sports and concussions|url = http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/healthy_kids/152611285.html|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A December 2008 report states that 29,167 female high school soccer players in the United States suffered from concussions in 2005, compared to 20,929 male players. In high school basketball, 12,923 girls suffered from concussions while only 3,823 boys did. Girls also sustained more concussions in softball, compared to boys in baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=75789 |title=High school headaches: Girls' concussions outnumber boys' in most sports |publisher=News.medill.northwestern.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214153958/http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=75789 |archivedate=2013-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Female athletes also had longer recovery times than males, and also had lower scores on visual memory tests. Girls also have longer recovery times for concussions, which may be due to a greater rate of blood flow in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/brain/news/20120511/concussions-girls-have-longer-recovery-time |title=Concussions: Girls Have Longer Recovery Time |publisher=Webmd.com |date=2012-05-11 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's ice hockey was reported as one of the most dangerous sports in the [[NCAA]], with a concussion rate of 2.72 per 1,000 player hours. Even though men's ice hockey allows body checking, while women's ice hockey does not, the rate of concussions for men is 46% lower, at 1.47 per 1,000 player hours. [[College football]] also has lower concussion rates than women's hockey, with a rate of 2.34 per 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klein |first=Jeff Z. |url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/at-the-mayo-clinic-womens-hockey-a-most-dangerous-game/ |title=Women's Hockey, a Most Dangerous Game - NYTimes.com |publisher=Slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2010-10-19 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women’s basketball is one of the women’s sports with the highest risks of getting a concussion. Women have a greater risk of getting a concussion by dribbling/ball handling rather than defending. Also it was found that female college basketball players typically receive concussions during games rather than practices.&lt;ref&gt;"The Epidemiology of Sport-Related Concussion." Clin Sports Med, 1 Jan. 2012. Web. 8 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention efforts and technology==
There has been a rise in the number of concussions each year, but this can be because of the fact that there is now more awareness of concussions and the symptoms of them. In order to be able to prevent concussions, there needs to be more awareness to second impact syndrome as well as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The reason for this is because when looking at cases where death was the result of a concussion, it was prevalent that they partook in physical activity too soon which resulted in death. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanson|first=Emily|last2=Stracciolini|first2=Andrea|last3=Mannix|first3=Rebekah|last4=Meehan|first4=William P.|date=2014-11-01|title=Management and Prevention of Sport-Related Concussion|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0009922813518429|journal=Clinical Pediatrics|language=en|volume=53|issue=13|pages=1221–1230|doi=10.1177/0009922813518429|issn=0009-9228}}&lt;/ref&gt;There have been numerous attempts at preventing concussions, such as the establishment of the PACE (Protecting Athletes Through Concussion Education) program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsgpace.org/ PACE program website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705162812/http://www.dsgpace.org/ |date=2012-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which works with the imPACT system, which is currently used by every NFL and some NHL teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2012/06/26/drew-brees-teams-up-against-concussions-in-school-sports/ |title=Drew Brees Teams Up Against Concussions in School Sports - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2012-06-26 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;As a college athlete the NCAA requires all sports to take a baseline test with imPACT, so they know where we are at before an injury occurs. This is helps the athletic trainers or any doctor with the post injury plan. This test also allows them to compare our results from the baseline to the actual injury to determine how severe it is. In 2008, the [[Arena Football League]] tested an [[impact monitor]] created by [[Schutt Sports]] called the "Shockometer", which is a triangular device attached to the back of [[football helmet]]s that has a light on the device that turns red when a concussion occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nflplayers.com/Articles/Public-News/AFL-Test-Drives-Schutt%e2%80%99s-Shockometer/ |title=AFL-Test-Drives-Schutt’S-Shockometer / News |publisher=NFLPlayers.com |date=2008-05-22 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some prevention's may include having them in booster seats, making sure your child’s helmet is the proper size and fit lastly playing on playgrounds that have soft surfaces. The NFL League has started designing helmets to help with the contact to the brain. These helmets wont 100% prevent a concussion, but they are designed to soften the blow that the head will take in order to minimize the damage that would be done. Although this new product is very expensive i think its safe to say that they are willing to do whatever possible it prevent these types of injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/16/news/companies/vicis-nfl-helmet-concussions-safety/index.html|title=Flexible NFL helmet aims to reduce head injuries|last=Garcia|first=Ahiza|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Riddell Sports Group, Inc.|Riddell]] has also created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to record the frequency and severity of player hits during practices and games.

The CCAT online tool developed by [[Axon Sports]] is another test to assist doctors in assessing concussion.

The term '''downtime''' is used to refer to periods when a system is unavailable.
'''Downtime''' or '''outage duration''' refers to a period of time that a [[system]] fails to provide or perform its primary function. [[Reliability engineering|Reliability]], [[availability]], recovery, and [[unavailability]] are related concepts.
The '''unavailability''' is the proportion of a time-span that a [[system]] is unavailable or [[offline]].
This is usually a result of the system [[failure|failing to function]] because of an unplanned event, or because of routine [[repair and maintenance|maintenance]] (a planned event).

The term is commonly applied to [[telecommunications network|network]]s and [[server (computing)|servers]]. The common reasons for unplanned outages are system failures (such as a [[Crash (computing)|crash]]) or communications failures (commonly known as '''network outage''').

The term is also commonly applied in industrial environments in relation to failures in industrial production equipment. Some facilities measure the downtime incurred during a work shift, or during a 12- or 24-hour period. Another common practice is to identify each downtime event as having an operational, electrical or mechanical origin.

The opposite of downtime is [[uptime]].

==Types==
Industry standards for the term "Outage Duration" or "Maintenance Duration" can have different point of initiation and completion thus the following clarification should be used to avoid conflicts in contract execution:
# "Turnkey" this is the most engrossing of all outage types.  Outage or Maintenance starts with operator of the plant or equipment pressing the shutdown or stop button to initiate a halt in operation.  Unless otherwise noted, Outage or Maintenance is considered completed when the plant or equipment is back in normal operation ready to begin manufacturing or ready be synchronized with system or grid or ready to perform duties as pump or compressor.
# "Breaker to Breaker" This Outage or Maintenance starts with operator of the plant or equipment removing the power circuit (Main power breaker at "off" or "disengaged" or "On-Cooldown"), not the control circuit from operation.  This still would allow for the equipment to be cooled down or brought to ambient such that outage/maintenance work can be prepared or initiated.  Depending on equipment types, "Breaker to Breaker" outage can be advantageous if contracting out controls related maintenance as this type of maintenance work can be performed while main equipment is still on cool-down or on stand-by.  Unless otherwise noted, this type of outage is considered complete when power circuit is re-energized via engaging of the power breaker.
# "Completion of [[Lockout-tagout|Lock-out/Tag-out]]" This Outage or Maintenance (sometimes mistaken for "Off-Cooldown" but not the same) starts with operator of the plant or equipment removing the power circuit, disengaging the control circuit and performing other neutralization of potential power and hazard sources (typically called Lock-Out, Tag-Out  "LOTO")  This point of maintenance period is typically the last phase of the outage initiation stage before actual work starts on the facility, plant or equipment.  Safety briefing should always follow the LOTO activity, before any work is conducted.  Unless otherwise noted, this type of outage is considered complete when the equipment has reached mechanical completion and ready to be placed on slow-roll for many heavy rotating equipment, Bump-test or rotation check for motors, etc., but must follow return or work permit per LOTO procedures.

Any on-line testing, performance testing and tuning required should not count towards the outage duration as these activities are typically conducted after the completion of outage or maintenance event and are out of control of most maintenance contractors.

==Characteristics==
Unplanned downtime may be the result of a [[software bug]], [[human error]], equipment [[failure]], malfunction, high [[bit error rate]], [[power failure]], [[Measuring network throughput|overload]] due to exceeding the [[channel capacity]], a [[cascading failure]], etc.

===Telecommunication outage classifications===
Downtime can be caused by failure in
hardware (physical equipment),

==Impact==

Outages caused by system failures can have a serious impact on the users of computer/network systems, in particular those industries that rely on a nearly 24-hour service:
* [[Medical informatics]]
* [[Nuclear power]] and other [[infrastructure]]
* [[Bank]]s and other [[financial institution]]s
* [[Aeronautics]], [[airline]]s
* [[News agency|News reporting]]
* [[E-commerce]] and [[online transaction processing]]
* [[Virtual world|Persistent online games]]

Also affected can be the users of an [[Internet service provider|ISP]] and other customers of a telecommunication network.

Corporations can lose business due to network outage or they may default on a contract, resulting in financial losses. According to [[Veeam Software|Veeam]] Availability Report, organizations encounter unplanned downtime, on average, 13 times per year with the average cost of one hour of downtime for a mission-critical applications equal to $82,864.

Those people or organizations that are affected by downtime can be more sensitive to particular aspects:
* some are more affected by the length of an outage - it matters to them how much time it takes to recover from a problem
* others are sensitive to the timing of an outage - outages during peak hours affect them the most

The most demanding users are those that require [[high availability]].

==Famous outages==
{{Recentism|date=May 2013}}
On [[Mother's Day]], Sunday, May 8, 1988, a fire broke out in the main switching room of the Hinsdale Central Office of the [[Illinois Bell]] telephone company. One of the largest [[Telephone exchange|switching]] systems in the state, the facility processed more than 3.5 million calls each day while serving 38,000 customers, including numerous businesses, hospitals, and Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Airports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/6.82.html#subj2.1 ''Risk Digest'' Volume 6: Issue 82 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually the entire [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] network of [[4ESS]] toll tandems switches went in and out of service over and over again on Jan. 15, 1990 disrupting long distance service for the entire United States.  The problem dissipated by itself when traffic slowed down. A software bug was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phworld.org/history/attcrash.htm |title=The Crash of the AT&amp;T Network in 1990|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AT&amp;T lost its [[frame relay]] network for 26 hours on April 13, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.keysight.com/upload/cmc_upload/All/sp-insight.pdf|title=Preventing IP Network Service Outages|last=|first=|date=|website=Agilent Technologies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affected many thousands of customers, and bank transactions were one casualty.  AT&amp;T failed to meet the [[service level agreement]] on their contracts with customers and had to refund&lt;ref&gt;[http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/19.72.html#subj6.1 Risk digest Volume 19 Issue 72 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; 6,600 [[customer account]]s, costing millions of dollars.

[[Xbox Live]] had intermittent downtime during the 2007–2008 holiday season which lasted thirteen days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/01/03/xbox-live-outage-day-13-still-up-and-down-still-preventing-fu/ |title=DAY 13 of Xbox Outage |date=2008-01-03 |publisher=Engadget |accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased demand from Xbox 360 purchasers (the largest number of new user sign-ups in the history of Xbox Live) was given as the reason for the downtime; in order to make amends for the service issues, Microsoft offered their users the opportunity to receive a free game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/141018/microsoft_offers_free_game_for_xbox_live_holiday_problems.html Microsoft offers free game for Xbox Live holiday problems]. [[PC World (magazine)|''PC World'']], January 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation Network outage|PlayStation Network April 2011 outage]], began on April 20, 2011, and was gradually restored on May 14, 2011 starting in the [[United States]]. This outage is the longest amount of time the PSN has been offline since its inception in 2006.  Sony has stated the problem was caused by an external intrusion which resulted in the confiscation of personal information.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j9AacQSaJXBQ3JUqZWxemjT8nMPw?docId=916344d02c284103af70f845db4befc1&lt;/ref&gt; Sony reported on April 26, 2011 that a large amount of user data had been obtained by the same hack that resulted in the downtime.

[[Telstra]]'s Ryde switch failed in late 2011 after water egressed into the electrical switch board from continuing wet weather. The Ryde switch is one of the largest by area switches in Australia, and affected more than 720,000 services.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The [[Miami]] datacenter of [[ServerAxis]] went offline unannounced on February 29, 2016 and was never restored. This impacted multiple providers and hundreds of websites. The outage impacted coverage of the [[2016 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament]] as WBBState, one of the affected sites, was by far the most comprehensive provider of women's basketball statistics available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-website-went-offline-and-took-most-of-womens-college-basketball-analytics-with-it/ A Website Went Offline And Took Most Of Women's College Basketball Analytics With It] [[FiveThirtyEight]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service levels==

In [[service level agreement]]s, it is common to mention a percentage value (per month or per year) that is calculated by dividing the sum of all downtimes timespans by the total time of a reference time span (e.g. a month). 0% downtime means that the server was available all the time.

For Internet servers downtimes above 1% per year or worse can be regarded as unacceptable as this means a downtime of more than 3 days per year. For e-commerce and other industrial use any value above 0.1% is usually considered unacceptable.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Response and reduction of impact==

It is the duty of the network designer to make sure that a network outage does not happen. When it does happen, a well-designed system will further reduce the effects of an outage by having localized outages which can be detected and fixed as soon as possible.

A process needs to be in place to detect a malfunction - [[network monitoring]] - and to restore the network to a working condition - this generally involves a [[help desk]] team that can [[troubleshoot]] a problem, one composed of trained engineers; a separate help desk team is usually necessary in order to field user input, which can be particularly demanding during a downtime.

A [[Network management model|network management]] system can be used to detect faulty or degrading components prior to customer complaints, with proactive fault rectification.

[[Risk management]] techniques can be used to determine the impact of network outages on an organisation and what actions may be required to minimise risk.  Risk may be minimised by using reliable components, by performing maintenance, such as upgrades, by using [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundant systems]] or by having a [[contingency plan]] or [[business continuity planning|business continuity plan]].
Technical means can reduce errors with [[error correcting code]]s, [[Retransmission (data networks)|retransmission]], [[redundancy check|checksum]]s, or [[diversity scheme]].

One of the biggest causes of downtime is misconfiguration, where a planned change goes wrong. Typically organisations rely on manual effort to manage the process of configuration backups, but this requires highly skilled engineers with the time to manage the process across a multi-vendor network. Automation tools are available to manage backups, but there are very few solutions that handle configuration recovery which is needed to minimize the overall impact of the outage.

==Planning==

A planned outage is the result of a planned activity by the system owner and/or by a [[service provider]]. These outages, often scheduled during the [[maintenance window]], can be used to perform tasks including the following:

* Deferred maintenance, e.g., a deferred hardware repair or a deferred restart to clean up a garbled memory
* Diagnostics to isolate a detected fault
* Hardware fault repair
* Fixing an error or omission in a configuration database or omission in a recent configuration database change
* Fixing an error in application database or an error in a recent application database change
* Software patching/software updates to fix a software fault.

Outages can also be planned as a result of a predictable natural event, such as [[Sun outage]].

Maintenance downtimes have to be carefully scheduled in industries that rely on computer systems. In many cases, system-wide downtimes can be averted using what is called a "rolling upgrade" - the process of incrementally taking down parts of the system for upgrade, without affecting the overall functionality.

==Avoidance==
For most websites, [[website monitoring]] is available.  Website monitoring (synthetic or passive) is a service that "monitors" downtime and users on the site.

==Other usage==

Downtime can also refer to time when human capital or other assets go down.  For instance, if employees are in meetings or unable to perform their work due to another constraint, they are down.  This can be equally expensive, and can be the result of another asset (i.e. computer/systems) being down.  This is also commonly known as "[[dead time]]".

This term is used also in factories or industrial use. See [[total productive maintenance]] (TPM).

==Measuring downtime==

There are many external services which can be used to monitor the uptime and downtime as well as availability of a service or a host.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14265">The '''early 2000s recession''' was a decline in economic activity which mainly occurred in developed countries. The [[recession]] affected the [[European Union]] during 2000 and 2001 and the [[United States]] in 2002 and 2003. The [[UK]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]] avoided the recession, while [[Russia]], a nation that did not experience prosperity during the 1990s, in fact began to recover from said situation.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Japan]]'s 1990s recession continued. This recession was predicted by economists, because the boom of the 1990s (accompanied by both low [[inflation]] and low [[unemployment]]) slowed in some parts of [[East Asia]] during the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. {{citation needed span|The recession in industrialized countries wasn't as significant as either of the two previous worldwide recessions. Some economists in the United States object to characterizing it as a recession since there were no two consecutive quarters of negative growth.|date=February 2013}}

==United States==

|right|thumb|300px]]

After the relatively mild [[early 1990s recession in the United States|1990 recession]] ended in early 1992, the country hit a belated unemployment rate peak of 7.8% in mid-1992. Job growth was initially muted by large layoffs among defense related industries.&lt;ref name="Hardone"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hardone |first1=Thomas |last2=Herz |first2=Diane |last3=Mellor |first3=Earl |last4=Hipple |first4=Steven |year=1993 |title=1992: Job Market in the Doldrums |journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=116 |issue=2 |pages=3–14 |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics |url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1993/02/art1full.pdf |accessdate=6 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, payrolls accelerated in 1992 and experienced robust growth through 2000.&lt;ref name="Martel"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martel |first1=Jennifer L. |last2=Langdon England|first2=David S. |year=2001 |title=2000: The Job Market in 2000: Slowing Down as the Year Ended |journal=Monthly Labor Review |volume=124 |issue=2 |pages=3–30 |publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics |url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2001/02/art1full.pdf |accessdate=6 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predictions that the bubble would burst emerged during the [[dot-com bubble]] in the late 1990s. Predictions about a future burst increased following the [[October 27, 1997 mini-crash]], in the wake of the [[Asian crisis]]. This caused an uncertain economic climate during the first few months of 1998. However conditions improved, and the [[Federal Reserve]] raised interest rates six times between June 1999 and May 2000 in an effort to cool the economy to achieve a [[soft landing (economics)|soft landing]]. The burst of the stock market bubble occurred in the form of the [[NASDAQ]] crash in March 2000. Growth in [[gross domestic product]] slowed considerably in the third quarter of 2000 to the lowest rate since a contraction in the first quarter of 1992.&lt;ref name="BEA1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=1&amp;ViewSeries=NO&amp;Java=no&amp;Request3Place=N&amp;3Place=N&amp;FromView=YES&amp;Freq=Qtr&amp;FirstYear=1990&amp;LastYear=2001&amp;3Place=N&amp;Update=Update&amp;JavaBox=no#Mid |title=Percent Change in Real Gross Domestic Product (Quarterly)|work=National Income and Product Accounts Table|publisher=Bureau of Economic Analysis|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee has determined that a peak in business activity occurred in the U.S. economy in March 2001. A peak marks the end of an expansion and the beginning of a recession. The determination of a peak date in March is thus a determination that the expansion that began in March 1992 ended in March 2001 and a recession began.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion lasted almost 10 years, the longest in the NBER's chronology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nber.org/cycles/november2001/recessnov.html]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER), which is the private, nonprofit, nonpartisan organization charged with determining economic recessions, the U.S. economy was in recession from March 2001 to November 2001,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html]&lt;/ref&gt; a period of eight months at the beginning of President George W. Bush's term of office. However, economic conditions did not satisfy the common shorthand definition of recession, which is "a fall of a country's real gross domestic product in two or more successive quarters", and has led to some confusion about the procedure for determining the starting and ending dates of a recession.

The NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee (BCDC) uses monthly, rather than quarterly, indicators to determine peaks and troughs in business activity,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions.html, retrieved 8 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as can be seen by noting that starting and ending dates are given by month and year, not quarters. However, controversy over the precise dates of the recession led to the characterization of the recession as the "Clinton Recession" by Republicans, if it could be traced to the final term of President [[Bill Clinton]].
BCDC members suggested they would be open to revisiting the dates of the recession as newer and more definitive data became available.&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;Henderson, Nell (January 22, 2004). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A38826-2004Jan22?language=printer Economists Say Recession Started in 2000]. ''The Washington Post.''&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2004, NBER President Martin Feldstein said:
{{quote|''It is clear that the [[revised data]] have made our original March date for the start of the recession much too late. We are still waiting for additional monthly data before making a final judgment. Until we have the additional data, we cannot make a decision.''&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;}}

However, the NBER [https://www.nber.org/cycles/jan08bcdc_memo.html has since confirmed that the recession started in March 2001].

From 2000 to 2001, the [[Federal Reserve]], in a move to protect the economy from [[irrational exuberance|the overvalued stock market]], made successive interest rate increases; while this may have initiated the readjustment, it is starkly contrasted with the severe, prolonged recession that would have occurred had the unsustainable growth continued unabated.&lt;ref name=Ruddy&gt;Ruddy, Christopher (January 31, 2006)[http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/1/31/90119.shtml Alan Greenspan's Real Legacy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201102154/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/1/31/90119.shtml |date=2009-12-01 }}. ''Newsmax''. Retrieved on July 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the stock market as an unofficial benchmark, a recession would have begun in March 2000 when the [[NASDAQ]] crashed following the collapse of the dot-com bubble.  The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] was relatively unscathed by the NASDAQ's crash until the [[September 11, 2001]] attacks, after which the DJIA suffered its worst one-day point loss and biggest one-week losses in history up to that point.  The market rebounded, only to [[Stock market downturn of 2002|crash once more]] in the final two quarters of 2002.  In the final three quarters of 2003, the market finally rebounded permanently, agreeing with the unemployment statistics that a recession defined in this way would have lasted from 2001 through 2003.

The Labor Department estimates that a net 1.735 million jobs were shed in 2001, with an additional net 508,000 lost during 2002. 2003 saw a small gain of a mere 105,000 jobs. Unemployment rose from 4.2% in February 2001 to 5.5% in November 2001, but did not peak until June 2003 at 6.3%, after which it declined to 5% by mid-2005.

==Canada==
Canada's economy is closely linked to that of the United States, and economic conditions south of the border tend to quickly make their way north. Canada's stock markets were especially hard hit by the collapse in high-tech stocks. For much of the 1990s the rapid rise of the [[TSX]] had almost wholly been attributed to two stocks: [[Nortel]] and [[Bell Canada|BCE]]. Both companies were hard hit by the downturn, especially Nortel, which was forced to lay off much of its workforce. The events of September 11 also hurt the Canadian stock markets and were especially devastating to the already troubled airline sector.

However, in the wider economy, Canada was surprisingly unhurt by these events. While growth slowed, the economy never actually entered a recession. This was the first time that Canada had avoided following the United States into an economic downturn. The rate of job creation in Canada continued at the rapid pace of the 1990s. A number of explanations have been advanced to explain this. Canada was not as directly affected by 9/11 and the subsequent wars, and the downward pressure of these events was more muted. Canada's fiscal management during the period has been praised as the federal government continued to bring in large surpluses throughout this period, in sharp contrast to the United States. Unlike the United States no major tax cuts or major new expenditures were introduced. However, during this time, Canada did pursue an expansionary monetary policy in an effort to reduce the effects of a possible recession. Many provincial governments suffered greater problems with a number of them returning to deficits, which was blamed on the [[Fiscal imbalance in Canada|fiscal imbalance]]. 2003 saw elections in six Canadian provinces and in only one did the governing party not lose seats.

==Russia==
{{See also|History of post-Soviet Russia#The crises of 1998}}

The Soviet Union's last year of economic growth was 1989, and throughout the 1990s, recession ensued in the [[Former Soviet Republics]].  In May 1998, following the 1997 [[1997 Asian financial crisis|crash of the East Asian economy]], things began to get even worse in Russia.  In August 1998, the value of the ruble fell 34% and people clamored to get their money out of banks (see [[1998 Russian financial crisis]]).  The government acted by dragging its feet on privatization programs.  Russians responded to this situation with approval by electing the more pro-[[dirigisme|dirigist]] and less [[classic liberalism|liberal]] [[Vladimir Putin]] as President in 2000.  Putin proceeded to reassert the role of the federal government, and gave it power it had not seen since the Soviet era.  State-run businesses were used to out-compete some of the more wealthy rivals of Putin.  Putin's policies were popular with the Russian people, gaining him re-election in 2004. At the same time, the export-oriented Russian economy enjoyed considerable influx of foreign currency thanks to rising worldwide oil prices (from $15 per barrel in early 1999 to an average of $30 per barrel during Putin's first term). The early 2000s recession was avoided in Russia due to rebound in exports and, to some degree, a return to [[dirigisme]].

==Japan==
Japan's recession, which started in the early 1990s, continued into the 2000s, with [[deflation]] being the main problem.  Deflation began plaguing Japan in the fiscal year ending 1999, and by 2005 the [[yen]] had 103% of its 2000 buying power.  The [[Bank of Japan]] attempted to cultivate [[inflation]] with high [[liquidity]] and a nominal 0% [[interest rate]] on loans.  Other aspects of the Japanese economy were good during the early 2000s; unemployment remained relatively low, and [[People's Republic of China|China]] became somewhat dependent on the Japanese exports.  The [[bear market]], however, continued in Japan, despite the best efforts of the Bank.

==European Union==
[[File:Évolution du taux directeur de la BCE (1999-2004).svg|thumb|450px|right|lang=en|The ECB prime rate is largely lowered starting from 2001.]]

Transition left the economy of the European Union in a cautiously optimistic state during the early 2000s.  The most difficult years were 2000–2001, precipitating the worst years of the American recession.  The European Union introduced a new currency on January 1, 1999.  The [[euro]], which was met with much anticipation, had its value immediately plummet, and it continued to be a weak currency throughout 2000 and 2001.  Inflation struck the [[Eurozone]] for a few months in summer 2001 but the economy deflated within months.  In 2002, the value of the euro began to rapidly rise (reaching parity with the US dollar on July 15, 2002).  This hurt business for companies based in Europe, as the profits made abroad (especially in the [[Americas]]) had an unfavorable exchange rate.

[[France]] and [[Germany]] both entered recession towards the end of 2001, but in May 2002 both countries declared that their recessions had ended after a mere six months each. Both economies suffered from [[Telecoms crash|global tech crash]] with the ruling German party introducing the then unpopular austerity, tax cuts and labor reforms nicknamed [[Hartz concept]] to boost the German economy in wake of an economic slump that would persist until the mid-2000s with unemployment peaking in Early 2005 of 12.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2003770.stm | work=BBC News | title=Germany's recession ends | date=May 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some European Union countries – including the [[United Kingdom]] – managed to delay sliding into recession until the late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7846266.stm | work=BBC News | title=UK in recession as economy slides | date=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edwardiiquarto.gif|thumb|200px|Title page of the earliest published text of ''Edward II'' (1594)]]
'''''Edward II''''' is a [[Renaissance]] or [[Early Modern period]] play written by [[Christopher Marlowe]]. It is one of the earliest English history plays. The full title of the first publication is '''''The Troublesome Reign and Lamentable Death of Edward the Second, King of England, with the Tragical Fall of Proud Mortimer'''''.

Marlowe found most of his material for this play in the third volume of [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s [[Holinshed's Chronicles|''Chronicles'']] (1587). Frederick Boas believes that "out of all the rich material provided by Holinshed" Marlowe was drawn to "the comparatively unattractive reign of Edward II" due to the relationship between the King and Gaveston. Boas elaborates, "Homosexual affection ... has (as has been seen) a special attraction for Marlowe. Jove and Ganymede in ''[[Dido, Queen of Carthage (play)|Dido]]'', Henry III and his 'minions' in ''[[The Massacre at Paris|The Massacre]]'', Neptune and Leander in ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'', and all akin, although drawn to a slighter scale, to Edward and Gaveston."&lt;ref name="Boas-174"&gt;Frederick S. Boas, ''Christopher Marlowe: A biographical and critical study'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953), pp. 174f&lt;/ref&gt; Boas also notes the existence of a number of parallels between ''Edward II'' and ''The Massacre at Paris'', asserting that "it is scarcely too much to say that scenes xi–xxi of ''The Massacre'' are something in the nature of a preliminary sketch for ''Edward II''."&lt;ref name=Boas-174/&gt; Marlowe stayed close to the account but embellished it with the character of Lightborn (or Lucifer) as Edward's assassin.

The play was entered into the [[Stationers' Register]] on 6 July 1593, five weeks after Marlowe's death. The earliest extant edition was published in [[book size|octavo]] in 1594, printed by Robert Robinson for the bookseller William Jones;&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; a second edition, issued in 1598, was printed by Richard Braddock for Jones. Subsequent editions were published in 1612, by Richard Barnes, and in 1622, by Henry Bell.

The 1594 first edition of the play is very rare and was uncovered only in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;''The Atheneum'', No. 2562, 2 Dec. 1876.&lt;/ref&gt; Only one copy, held at the [[Zentralbibliothek Zürich]], was known to exist after a second was lost in the Second World War. In 2012, a third copy was discovered in Germany by [[Jeffrey Masten]], a scholar of English Renaissance literature and the history of sexuality and a faculty member at Northwestern University. The volume was bound with a treatise arguing against the execution of heretics and another on Turkey and Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jeffrey | last=Masten | title=Bound for Germany: Heresy, sodomy, and a new copy of Marlowe's Edward II | work=Times Literary Supplement | date=28 December 2012 | pages=17–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
There have never{{Weasel inline|date=September 2018}} been any doubts about the authorship of the play. Dodsley included it in his ''Select Collection of Old Plays'' in 1744, but Marlowe's name was not even mentioned in the preface.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Dodsley. ''Select Collection of Old Plays'' (12 vols.), 1744&lt;/ref&gt; Marlowe's reputation was still damaged by [[Thomas Beard]]'s libel in ''The Theatre of God's Judgement'', published in 1597.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Thomas Dabbs. ''Reforming Marlowe: The Nineteenth-Century Canonization of a Renaissance Dramatist.'' London, (Toronto: Associated University Presses, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The play telescopes most of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]'s reign into a single narrative, beginning with the recall of his favourite, [[Piers Gaveston]], from exile, and ending with his son, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], executing [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Mortimer Junior]] for the king's murder.

Marlowe's play opens at the outset of the reign, with Edward's exiled [[favourite]], Piers Gaveston, rejoicing at the recent death of Edward I and his own resulting ability to return to England. In the following passage he plans the entertainments with which he will delight the king:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Music and poetry is his delight;
Therefore I'll have Italian masques by night,
Sweet speeches, comedies, and pleasing shows;
And in the day, when he shall walk abroad,
Like sylvan nymphs my pages shall be clad;
My men, like satyrs grazing on the lawns,
Shall with their goat-feet dance an antic hay.
Sometime a lovely boy in Dian's shape,
With hair that gilds the water as it glides,
Crownets of pearl about his naked arms,
And in his sportful hands an olive tree
To hide those parts which men delight to see,
Shall bathe him in a spring; and there, hard by,
One like Actaeon, peeping through the grove,
Shall by the angry goddess be transformed,
And running in the likeness of a hart
By yelping hounds pulled down and seem to die.
Such things as these best please his majesty.&lt;/poem&gt;|I.i.53–70}}

Upon Gaveston's re-entry into the country, Edward gives him titles, access to the royal treasury, and the option of having guards protect him. Although Gaveston himself is not of noble birth, he maintains that he is better than common people and craves pleasing shows, Italian masques, music and poetry. However, as much as Gaveston pleases the king he finds scant favour from the king's nobles, who are soon clamouring for Gaveston's exile. Almost as soon as he arrives, Gaveston and Edward's court begin to quarrel. Edward is forced to agree to this and banishes Gaveston to Ireland. [[Isabella of France]], the Queen, who still hopes for his favour, persuades Mortimer, who later becomes her lover, to argue for his recall, though only so that he may be more conveniently murdered. The nobles accordingly soon find an excuse to turn on Gaveston again, and eventually capture and execute him. Before executing Gaveston, Edward requests to see Gaveston one more time. Arundel and Pembroke agree to Edward's request. However, Warwick attacks and kills Gaveston while he is being taken to Edward. Edward in turn executes two of the nobles who persecuted Gaveston, Warwick and Lancaster.

Edward then seeks comfort in new favourites, Spencer and his father. This alienates Isabella, who takes Mortimer as her lover and travels to France with her son in search of allies. France, however, will not help the queen and refuses to give her arms, although she does get help from Sir John of Hainault. Edward, both in the play and in history, is nothing like the soldier his father was – it was during his reign that the English army was disastrously defeated at [[Bannockburn]] – and is soon {{Linktext|outgeneralled}}. Edward takes refuge in [[Neath Abbey]], but is betrayed by a mower, who emblematically carries a scythe. Both Spencers are executed, and the king himself is taken to [[Kenilworth]]. His brother Edmund, Earl of Kent, after having initially renounced his cause, now tries to help him but realizes too late the power the young Mortimer now has. Arrested for approaching the imprisoned Edward, Edmund is taken to court, where Mortimer, Isabella, and [[Edward III]] preside. He is executed by Mortimer, who claims he is a threat to the throne, despite the pleading of Edward III.

The prisoner king is then taken to [[Berkeley Castle]], where he meets the luxuriously cruel Lightborn, whose name is an anglicised version of "Lucifer". Despite knowing that Lightborn is there to kill him, Edward asks him to stay by his side. Lightborn, realizing that the king will not fall for delay, has him restrained by four men, and murders him by burning out his bowels from the inside with a red hot poker (so as not to leave external marks of violence). Maltravers and Gurney witness this, before Gurney kills Lightborn to keep his silence. Later, however, Gurney flees, and Mortimer sends Maltravers after him, as they fear betrayal. Isabella arrives to warn Mortimer that Edward III, her son with Edward II, has discovered their plot. Before they can plan accordingly, her son arrives with attendants and other lords, accusing Mortimer of murder. Mortimer denies this, but eventually is arrested and taken away. He tells Isabella not to weep for him, and the queen begs her son to show Mortimer mercy, but he refuses. Edward III then orders Mortimer's death and his mother's imprisonment, and the play ends with him taking the throne.

== Themes ==
'''Homoeroticism and Sodomy'''

Edward and Gaveston's homoerotic relationship provides the backdrop for the play. When Gaveston plans to produce his masque, he describes "a lovely boy in Dian's shape… / And in his sportful hands an olive tree/ To hide those parts which men delight to see" (1.2.60–63). Gaveston is deeply aware of the theatre's ability to eroticize young male actors. The Queen feels jealous of Gaveston and Edward's relationship, noting: "For now my lord the king regards me not, / But dotes upon the love of Gaveston. / He claps his cheeks and hangs about his neck, / Smiles in his face and whispers in his ears" (2.2.49–52).

Much of the criticism focused on ''Edward II'' focuses on homoeroticism and power. For example, Emily Bartels's ''Spectacles of Strangeness''—which focuses on how Marlowe depicts "others" and how that depiction exposes "demonization of the other as a strategy for self-authorization and self-empowerment"—has a chapter on ''Edward II'' entitled "The Show of Sodomy."&lt;ref name="Bartels"&gt;Bartels, Emily. ''Spectacles of Strangeness''. University of Pennsylvania Press,1993.P.XV.&lt;/ref&gt; In this chapter, Bartels focuses on how sodomy is politicized, exposed, and defined, stating, "In Marlowe, sodomy is finally neither unseeable nor unspeakable. Rather it is exposed as a subject obscured and displayed as beyond display by those who would maintain a hegemonic hold over 'what the matter meant.'"&lt;ref&gt;Bartels, Emily. ''Spectacles of Strangeness''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993. P.145.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to show how sodomy works in Marlowe's plays, Bartels places particular attention to the tension between how sodomy is hidden in the play and then sanctioned as the means of killing Edward.&lt;ref name=Bartels1993&gt;Bartels, Emily.  ''Spectacles of Strangeness.'' University of Pennsylvania, 1993, 143-73&lt;/ref&gt; Bartels pays close attention to the fact that Lightborne's murder of the king leaves no marks on his body.&lt;ref name=Bartels1993/&gt; She concludes that "sodomical leanings...are not politically corrupt. Though largely unspoken, they are not unspeakable."&lt;ref&gt;Bartels, Emily. ''Spectacles of Strangeness''. University of Pennsylvania, 1993. p.172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sodomy was not a clearly defined act in the early modern period. Jonathan Goldberg asserts that sodomy was "invisible so long as homosexual acts failed to connect with the much more visible signs of social disruption represented by unorthodox religious or social positions."&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, Jonathan.  "Sodomy and Society:The Case of Cristopher Marlowe."  ''Staging the Renaissance: Reinterpretations of Elizabethan and Jacobean Drama. ''  Edited by David Kastan and Peter Stallybrass, Routledge, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; David Stymeist reconciles two opposing critical approaches to ''Edward II''—one that views the play as subversive towards sexual norms and one that upholds sexual norms—by paying attention to how the play presents alternative sexuality and how it punishes sexual transgressions.&lt;ref&gt;Stymeist, David.  "Status, Sodomy, and the Theatre in Marlowe's 'Edward II.'"  ''Studies in English Literature, 1590-1900,'' vol.44, no.2, 2004, pp.233-253.  ''JSTOR,'' JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/3844628&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religion'''

''Edward II'' presents tension between the church and the state. When Edward and Gaveston strip the Bishop of Coventry of his lands and possessions, they joke subversively about religious traditions. Edward and Gaveston mock the Bishop as they attack him. Before the play takes place, the Bishop advocates for Gaveston's exile. As Edward and Gaveston attack the Bishop, they mock Catholic symbols as they assert their power over the Bishop:

Gaveston: Saving your reverence, you must pardon me.

[He lays hold of him.]

Edward: Throw off his golden mitre, rend his stole,

And in the channel christen him anew (1.1.185–89).

Edward and Gaveston attack the symbols of the church—baptisms, pardons, and church attire—to humiliate the Bishop. After Edward allows Gaveston to take the Bishop's possessions, Gaveston states, "A prison may beseem his holiness" (1.1.206). Later in the play, the Archbishop of Canterbury threatens to "discharge these lords / Of duty and allegiance to [Edward]," and Edward asks, "Why should a king be subject to a priest?" (1.4.61–62, 96). In her essay "Marlowe, History, and Politics," Paulina Kewes asserts that ''Edward II'' uses religious history to comment on politics: "Marlowe...[invites] the audience to consider the contingent religious colouring of the conflict between the crown and the nobility...Marlowe's target is the widespread use of religion to justify political heterodoxy."&lt;ref&gt;"Marlowe, History, and Politics." Kewes, Paulina.  ''Christopher Marlowe in Context,'' edited by Emily Bartels and Emma Simth, Cambridge UP, 2013. pp.138-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social Status'''

''Edward II'' is a play that is deeply aware of social status and its relationship to birthrights. Mortimer is deeply resentful of Gaveston's social mobility and repeatedly claims that Gaveston is "hardly a gentleman by birth" (1.4.29). Later, when Mortimer Senior asserts that "the mightiest kings have had their minions" (1.4.390), Mortimer responds that Gaveston's "wanton humour grieves [him] not, but this [he scorns], that one so basely born / Should by his sovereign's favour grow so pert / And riot it with the treasure of the realm" (1.4.401–04). The nobility's treatment of Spencer and Spencer Senior mirrors their treatment of Gaveston. When Spencer and Lancaster start arguing about treason, Pembroke responds by calling Spencer a "base upstart" (3.3.21). The nobility also call Spencer a flatterer multiple times. However, in ''Edward II'', social mobility, social status, and power come with consequences. Clifford Leech shows how the play ties together themes of power, social status, and suffering, stating, "In ''Tamburlaine'' [Marlowe] had already contemplated power, and saw the spectacle inevitably involved suffering. Here the suffering, still consequential on the exercise and the dream of power, is the major fact."&lt;ref name=Leech1958&gt;Leech, Clifford.  "Marlowe's 'Edward II': Power and Suffering." ''The Critical Quarterly,''Vol. 1. Spring 1959. pp. 181-197&lt;/ref&gt; Leech notes that each of the characters who strives for power or holds a powerful position in the play—Edward, Gaveston, the Queen,and Mortimer—each meets a tragic end as they vie for power&lt;ref name=Leech1958/&gt;

==Stage history and adaptations==
According to Andrew Gurr, the first known performance of ''Edward II'' was in 1592 by the [[Earl of Pembroke's Men]], possibly at the Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Gurr, Andrew.  ''The Shakespearean Stage 1574-1642''. Cambridge UP,2009&lt;/ref&gt; Roslyn Knutson has speculated on the original performance for ''Edward II''. In her essay, "Marlowe, Company Ownership, and the Role of Edward II," she argues that ''Edward II'' was written for Edward Alleyn and Strange's Men; however, Pembroke's Men performed ''Edward II'' with Richard Burbage (the most prominent actor in William Shakespeare's playing company) as Edward.&lt;ref&gt;Knutson, Roslyn.  "Marlowe, Company Ownership, and the Role of Edward II."  ''Medieval &amp; Renaissance England, Vol. 18. (2005)'' Rosemont Publishing &amp; Printing Corp DBA Associate University Press, 2005.  pp.37-46&lt;/ref&gt; Knutson uses the number of lines assigned to players, Marlowe's familiarity to the different play companies, and the role of Isabella to provide evidence for her argument. She concludes that Burbage's performance in ''Edward II'' influenced how Shakespeare designed roles for Burbage.

The first [[quarto]] of 1594 states that the play was originally performed by the [[Earl of Pembroke's Men]]. According to E.K. Chambers, ''Edward II'' was one of three plays sold to booksellers—along with ''The Taming of A Shrew'' and ''The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York''—and was probably the only one of those three not worked on by Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Elizabethan Stage. Vol. II|last=Chambers|first=E.K.|publisher=Oxford, Clarendon Press|year=1951|isbn=|location=|pages=128–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathew Martin argues that the Roger Barnes's 1612 version of ''Edward II''—while traditionally seen as a corrupt publishing of the play—reveals how the play was received in Jacobean England and how the play was revised to draw attention to King James's controversial promotion of male favorites.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Mathew.  "Accidents Happen: Roger Barnes's 1612 Edition of Marlowe's 'Edward II'."  ''Early Theatre'', Vol.16.No.1., 2003. https://www.jstor.org/stable/43499695Italic text''''&lt;/ref&gt; The title page of the 1622 edition states that the play was performed by [[Queen Anne's Men]] at the [[Red Bull Theatre]], showing that ''Edward II'' was still in the active repertory well into the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the twentieth century, the play has been revived several times, usually in such a way as to make explicit Edward's [[homosexuality]].

Marlowe's play was revived in November 1961 in a student performance at the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Taken from the Nottingham University Dramatic Society programme&lt;/ref&gt; It was frequently revived in the 1970s. The [[Prospect Theatre Company]]'s production of the play, starring [[Ian McKellen]] and [[James Laurenson]], caused a sensation when it was broadcast by the [[BBC]] during the 1970s (as it included the first gay kiss transmitted on British television). Numerous other productions followed, starring actors such as [[Simon Russell Beale]] and [[Joseph Fiennes]]. In 1995 a [[Edward II (ballet)|ballet adaptation]] was created for [[Stuttgart Ballet]].

In 1977, the 26-episode [[BBC]] [[radio drama]] ''Vivat Rex'' included an abridged version of the play as its first two episodes. [[John Hurt]] portrayed Edward.

In 1986 [[Nicholas Hytner]] directed a production at the [[Royal Exchange, Manchester]] with [[Ian McDiarmid]], [[Michael Grandage]], [[Iain Glen]] and [[Duncan Bell]].

In 1991, the play was adapted into a [[Edward II (film)|film]] by [[Derek Jarman]] which used modern costumes and made overt reference to the [[gay rights]] movement and the [[Stonewall riots]].

In 2000, a production of the play was presented in [[Los Angeles]] by the [[ARK Theatre Company]], founded by former RSC member Paul Wagar. The production was directed by Don Stewart.

The [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[Shakespeare Theatre Company]] 2007 staging used mostly fascist-era and jazz age costumes. The production strongly emphasized the gay relationship between Edward II and Gaveston and was one of two Marlowe works inaugurating the company's new [[Sidney Harman Hall]].

in 2011 EM-LOU Productions staged the play at [[The Rose Theatre]], Bankside, returning it (for the first time in 400 years) to the space where it may have had its very first production. The production was directed by Peter Darney.

The play continues to be popular, with [[University of Birmingham]] students staging it in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespeareinstituteplayers.co.uk|title=Home - Shakespeare Institute Players|website=shakespeareinstituteplayers.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013 the play was revived by the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in their [[Olivier Theatre|Olivier]] auditorium, with John Heffernan taking the title role.

In October 2013, the [[New National Theatre Tokyo]] staged the play in Japanese, featuring Mori Shintaro as a director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nntt.jac.go.jp/english/play/e30000062_play.html|title=Edward II|website=jac.go.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 May 2015 a production by Scena Mundi opened at St Bartholomew the Great in Smithfield London, scheduled to run until 2 July.

On 1 October 2015 a production by [[Sport For Jove Theatre Company|Sport for Jove]] opened at the [[Seymour Centre]] Sydney, directed by Terry Karabelas.

On 29 July 2016 an adaptation titled "Edward II" opened at [[Malthouse Theatre]], Melbourne, Australia, directed by [[Matthew Lutton]] and written by Anthony Weigh.

On 29 September 2016 a production by the UBC Department of Theatre and Film opened at the Chan Centre in Vancouver, BC, Canada, scheduled to run until 15 October 2016.

In January 2017, Oxford University students presented a version of the play at Oxford Playhouse, noting parallels with the fall of the Soviet Union.

===Bertolt Brecht's adaptation===

The play was adapted by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Lion Feuchtwanger]]&lt;ref&gt;"I wrote this play with Lion Feuchtwanger"; Dedication page from ''Leben Eduards des Zweiten von England'', 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1923 as ''[[The Life of Edward II of England]] (Leben Eduard des Zweiten von England)''. The Brecht version, while acknowledging Marlowe's play as its source, uses Brecht's own words, ideas, and structure, and is regarded as a separate work. The German premiere took place in 1924 under Brecht's direction at the [[Munich Kammerspiele]] with [[Erwin Faber]] and Hans Schweikart as Edward and Baldock; the New York premiere of Brecht's ''[[The Life of Edward II of England]]'' took place in 1982, staged by W. Stuart McDowell by the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]], sponsored by [[Joseph Papp]] and the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] at [[The Shakespeare Center]] on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper West Side]].&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, W. Stuart.  "Acting Brecht: The Munich Years," ''The Brecht Sourcebook'', Carol Martin, Henry Bial, editors (Routledge, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal defenses}}
'''False evidence''', '''fabricated evidence''', '''forged evidence''' or '''tainted evidence''' is information created or obtained illegally, to sway the verdict in a court case. Falsified evidence could be created by either side in a case (including the police/prosecution in a [[criminal law|criminal case]]), or by someone sympathetic to either side.  Misleading by [[motion to suppress|suppressing evidence]] can also be considered a form of false evidence ([[lying by omission|by omission]]), however, in some cases, suppressed evidence is excluded because it cannot be proved the accused was aware of the items found or of their location. The analysis of evidence ([[forensic evidence]]) may also be forged if the person doing the forensic work finds it easier to fabricate evidence and test results than to perform the actual work involved. [[Parallel construction]] is a form of false evidence in which the evidence is truthful but its origins are untruthfully described, at times in order to avoid evidence being excluded as [[inadmissible evidence|inadmissible]] due to unlawful means of procurement such as an [[search warrant|unlawful search]].

Apart from the desire for one side or another to succeed or fail in its case, the exact rationale for falsifying evidence can vary. Falsifying evidence to procure the conviction of those honestly believed guilty is considered a form of [[police corruption]] even though it is intended to (and may) result in the conviction of the guilty;  however it may also reflect the incorrect prejudices of the falsifier, and it also tends to encourage corrupt police behavior generally. In the [[United Kingdom]], this is sometimes called '[[Noble Cause Corruption]]'. A "throw down", i.e. the [[Frameup|planting]] of a weapon at a crime scene might be used by the police to justify shooting the victim in self-defense, and avoid possible prosecution for [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://openjurist.org/689/f2d/1220/webster-v-city-of-houston |title= 689 F. 2d 1220 - Webster v. City of Houston |at= paragraph 29 |website=openjurist.org |date= 28 October 1982|accessdate= 17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the accused might have falsified some evidence, especially if not arrested immediately, or by having other access to a crime scene and related areas.

==Types==
* ''Forged evidence'' - an item or information manufactured, or altered, to support some agenda, is not admissible in many courts, including U.S. criminal courts.
* ''Planted evidence'' - an item or information which has been moved, or planted at a scene, to seem related to the accused party, is not admissible in many courts, including U.S. criminal courts.
* ''Tainted evidence'' - information which has been obtained by illegal means or has been revealed (or traced) using evidence acquired by illegal search, and/or seizure, is called the "fruit of the poisonous tree" and is not admissible in many courts, including U.S. criminal courts.
* [[Parallel construction]] - tainted evidence, where the origin of the evidence is untruthfully represented, preventing discussion of whether it was legally obtained or not.
* ''Suppressed evidence'' - an item or information which a court judge has ruled as "inadmissible" is forbidden to be presented in a court case. Suppressed evidence might be excluded because it was found hidden or locked away in areas the accused could not be proven to know.

In some criminal cases, a person will be identified as a "[[person of interest]]" for a few days before arrest, allowing time to reveal suspicious actions (such as in recorded phone calls), or to attempt to falsify evidence before their arrest. A type of falsified evidence, used to acquit, would be faked sales receipts which indicated activities (with the accused) had occurred elsewhere during the time of the crime.

===The Crewe murders===
{{main|Harvey and Jeanette Crewe}}
In June 1970 a [[Pukekawa]], [[Waikato Plains|Lower Waikato]], couple were killed and their bodies dumped in the [[Waikato River]]. [[Arthur Allan Thomas]], a local farmer, was twice convicted of their murders but following massive publicity was later given a [[Royal Pardon]].

Two bullet cases presented by senior policemen Hutton and Johnston were crucial evidence for the conviction. In 1980, after Thomas's pardon a [[Royal commission]] into the convictions concluded "Mr Hutton and Mr Johnston planted the shellcase, exhibit 350 in the Crewe garden, and that they did so to manufacture evidence that Mr Thomas's rifle had been used for the killings."&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/r.christie/thomas_royal_commission_1980.pdf|title=Report of the Royal Commission to inquire into the Circumstances of the Convictions of Arthur Allan Thomas for the Murders of David Harvey screwed Jeanette Lenore Crewe |last=Taylor|first=Robert Linsay|author2=John Bowie Gorden|author3=Allen Howard Johnston|date=1980|work=Book|publisher=NZ Government Printer|pages=125|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Killing of Bernard Whitehurst ===
{{Main article|Killing of Bernard Whitehurst}}
In 1975, after the shooting death of '''Bernard Whitehurst'''  by a [[Montgomery, Alabama]] police officer who mistakenly thought Whitehurst was the suspect in the robbery of a neighborhood grocery store, there was&amp;nbsp;a police [[cover-up]]&amp;nbsp;that included police officers planting a gun on him from the police evidence room. The coroner relied on police reports that Whitehurst was killed by a bullet fired through the chest.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1977/04/03/alabamas-watergate/94450203-adc3-4ba1-8805-fec5ebd456c9/|title=Alabama's 'Watergate'|last=MacPherson|first=Myra|date=1977-04-03|work=|last2=|first2=|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-11-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an investigation by the local newspaper and local attorney Donald Watkins raised questions about the facts of the case, six months later, the District Attorney James Evans ordered the body to be exhumed and an autopsy to be performed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The results of the autopsy showed that Whitehurst had been shot in the back.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The attempted cover-up led to the resignation of  eight police officers, the city’s mayor, James Robinson and the Director of Public Safety, Ed Wright.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/local/2015/12/04/montgomery-erects-second-marker-honoring-bernard-whitehurst/76797052/|title=Montgomery erects second marker honoring Bernard Whitehurst|newspaper=The Montgomery Advertiser|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/02/06/archives/top-police-officer-in-montgomery-quits-director-fails-a-polygraph.html|title=TOP POLICE OFFICER IN MONTGOMERY QUITS|last=Times|first=Special To The New York|date=1977-02-06|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; No police officer was convicted of a crime.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.al.com/montgomery/2013/04/city_of_montgomery_unveils_mar.html|title=City of Montgomery unveils marker recognizing police cover-up in 1975 shooting death of Bernard Whitehurst; family still wants apology (photos)|newspaper=AL.com|access-date=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty years later, the Montgomery City Council passes a resolution that formally expressed regret for the shooting and cover-up.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Murder of Holly Staker===

{{main|Juan Rivera (wrongful conviction)}}

In 1992, 11-year-old Holly Staker was raped and murdered while babysitting in [[Waukegan, Illinois]]. A local man named [[Juan Rivera (wrongful conviction)|Juan Rivera]] was convicted of the murder solely on the basis of a confession, one that he claimed was coerced. No physical evidence linked him to the crime scene and many details of his confession contradicted known evidence from the crime scene. [[DNA testing]] done in 2004 on semen taken from the crime scene ruled out Rivera as the source, however, the prosecution argued that the semen sample came from previous consensual sex with another man. Rivera was convicted again. His conviction was overturned by the [[appellate court]] who took the unusual step of barring prosecutors from retrying Rivera and he was released.&lt;ref name=Appeal&gt;{{cite news|title=People V. Rivera|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/il-court-of-appeals/1588686.html|agency=Appellate Court of Illinois, Second District|date=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release, Rivera's attorneys asked the courts to order genetic testing on a piece of evidence the prosecution had tried to use at his trial in 1993. Rivera's shoes had blood on them, which the prosecution argued belonged to Holly. The prosecution withdrew them prior to his first trial when it was discovered that the shoes were not available for sale anywhere in the United States until after the murder. In 2015, Juan's attorney sought further forensic testing on the shoes. DNA analysis indicated that the blood indeed belonged to Holly, but also contained another genetic sample; one that matched the semen sample. Rivera's defense team insists that this is proof not only that the blood was planted, but that the real killer's DNA was inadvertently [[Tampering with evidence|planted]] as well. The DNA has yet to be matched to an individual, but has been linked to DNA from another home invasion and murder. The man convicted of that crime also claims to be wrongfully convicted.&lt;ref name=Mills&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mills|first1=Steve|title=Attorneys: Police planted blood on Juan Rivera's shoes in Waukegan slaying|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-juan-rivera-shoes-met-20141210-story.html#page=1|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ordered tests"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hinkel|first1=Dan|last2=Mills|first2=Steve|title=Judge orders tests for alleged evidence tampering in Juan Rivera case|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-juan-rivera-shoes-test-met-20150130-story.html|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York State Police Troop C scandal===
In the [[New York State Police Troop C scandal]] of 1993, Craig D. Harvey, a New York State Police trooper, was charged with fabricating evidence. Harvey admitted he and another trooper lifted fingerprints from items the suspect, John Spencer, touched while in Troop C headquarters during booking. He attached the fingerprints to evidence cards and later claimed that he had pulled the fingerprints from the scene of the murder. The forged evidence was used during trial and John Spencer was sentenced to 50 years to life in prison.&lt;ref name=admits&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Police Investigation Supervisor Admits Faking Fingerprints |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/30/nyregion/police-investigation-supervisor-admits-faking-fingerprints.html |quote=In a widening scandal that has rocked the New York State Police, a lieutenant who supervised criminal investigations in seven upstate counties admitted yesterday that he had faked fingerprint evidence in three cases. The lieutenant, Craig D. Harvey, also said in court in Delhi, N.Y., that he had been assisted in fabricating evidence by another lieutenant, Patrick O'Hara, who works out of state police headquarters in Albany supervising drug and organized-crime investigations. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 30, 1993 |accessdate=2007-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the truth came out, it was discovered that they had been falsifying evidence in cases for many years. At least three officers were convicted. Every case the department had been involved in had to be reinvestigated.

===FBI scandal===
In the 1990s, the [[fingerprint]], [[DNA]], and explosive units of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory]] had written reports confirming local police department theories without actually performing the work.

Such laws and regulatory procedures stipulating the conditions under which evidence can be handled and manipulated fall under a body of due process statues called [[chain of custody]] rules. It is crucial for law enforcement agencies to scrupulously collect, handle and transfer evidence in order to avoid its falsification. In most jurisdictions, chain of evidence rules require that the transfer of criminal evidence be handled by as few persons as possible. To prevent error or improper tampering, chain of evidence rules also stipulate that those authorized to experiment with collected evidence document the nature, time, date and duration of their handling.

===Iraq and Afghanistan Wars===
In the [[Iraq War|wars in Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], soldiers have been known to place weapons on or near a slain individual to make that person appear to be an [[enemy combatant]] or [[Insurgency|insurgent]].&lt;ref name=Inde25/&gt;&lt;ref name=Post24/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox25/&gt; Alternatively, a drop weapon or other item is left in the open; any individual who picks it up may be fired upon; a process known as [[Sniper#Baiting|baiting]].&lt;ref name=Inde25/&gt;&lt;ref name=Post24&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/23/AR2007092301431.html U.S. Aims To Lure Insurgents With 'Bait'], [[The Washington Post]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox25&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,297903,00.html U.S. Army Snipers Accused of 'Baiting' Iraqi Insurgents], [[Fox News]] September 25, 2007 "sworn statements and testimony in the cases of two other accused Ranger snipers indicate that the Army has a classified program that encourages snipers to "bait" potential targets and then kill whoever takes the bait", "The transcript of a court hearing for two of the three accused snipers makes several references to the existence of a classified "baiting" program"&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of drop weapons has been the cause of some controversy in the Iraq War.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1711636,00.html Murder or Exhaustion in Iraq?], [[Time (magazine)|Time]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stark&gt;[http://www.stark.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=690:stark-writes-to-defense-secretary-gates-to-express-alarm-at-military-baiting-of-iraqis&amp;catid=14:press-releases-2007&amp;Itemid=66 Stark writes to Defense Secretary Gates to express alarm at military "Baiting" of Iraqis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AP25&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/24/AR2007092401421.html U.S. Snipers Accused of 'Baiting' Iraqis], Pauline Jelinek and Robert Burns, [[The Associated Press]], September 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, three [[United States Army]] soldiers were found guilty of planting evidence in this way; one of them, Sgt. Evan Vela, was also sentenced to a 10-year prison term for murder of an unarmed Iraqi.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

A military court found that on the 27th of April, 2007, [[Spc.|Specialist]] Jorge Sandoval, shot an Iraqi man, on the order of Staff Sgt. Michael Hensley. The two men then placed a spool of wire into the pocket of the dead man, who had been cutting grass with a rusty sickle.&lt;ref name=Post24/&gt; Hensley and Sandoval were charged with murder, of which they were acquitted, and with planting evidence, of which they were found guilty.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

The [[Asymmetric Warfare Group]] is said by Captain Didier to have sent boxes of the kind normally used to hold ammunition filled with "drop items" to his unit, the [[501st Infantry Regiment (United States)|1st Battalion 501st Infantry Regiment]] in order "to disrupt the AIF ([[Anti-Iraqi Forces]]) attempts at harming coalition forces and give us the upper hand in a fight."&lt;ref name=Inde25&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/weapons-left-by-us-troops-used-as-bait-to-kill-iraqis-403421.html Weapons left by US troops 'used as bait to kill Iraqis'], Kim Sengupta, Baghdad, [[The Independent]], 25 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Post24/&gt;

[[The Independent]] newspaper quoted a [[spokesperson]] for the US military as saying: "There are no classified programs that authorise the murder of local nationals and the use of 'drop weapons' to make killings appear legally justified."&lt;ref name=Inde25/&gt;
&lt;!--from the [[Falsification of evidence]] article. This is more a story on police out of control rather than forging evidence.
==Rampart scandal==
The giving of false testimony under oath by police officers during criminal trials has become so prevalent in some jurisdictions that the term [[testilying]] was coined to describe it. An excellent example of testilying would be the [[Rampart Scandal]] of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. --&gt;
&lt;!-- from the [[Falsification of evidence]] article. This is more of a dirty trick than forging forensic evidence
In the [[United States]], one form of falsifying evidence is called the [[snitch jacket]], a process whereby false evidence of an activist being a police informer in left in a public place where it can be found by colleagues of an activist, so that the person being targeted is discredited. --&gt;

{{Tort law}}
In [[law]], '''fraud''' is [[intent (law)|deliberate]] [[deception]] to secure unfair or unlawful gain, or to deprive a victim of a legal right. Fraud itself can be a [[Civil law (common law)|civil wrong]] (i.e., a fraud victim may sue the fraud perpetrator to avoid the fraud or recover monetary compensation), a [[criminal law|criminal wrong]] (i.e., a fraud perpetrator may be prosecuted and imprisoned by governmental authorities), or it may cause no loss of money, property or legal right but still be an element of another civil or criminal wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/default.aspx?selected=785 |title=Legal Dictionary: fraud |publisher=Law.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of fraud may be monetary gain or other benefits, such as obtaining a passport or travel document, driver's license or [[mortgage fraud|qualifying for a mortgage]] by way of false statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Issues/2004/Oct/BasicLegalConcepts.htm |title=Basic Legal Concepts |publisher=Journal of Accountancy |date= |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[hoax]] is a distinct concept that involves deliberate deception without the intention of gain or of materially damaging or depriving a victim.

==As a civil wrong==
In common law jurisdictions, as a civil wrong, fraud is a [[tort]]. While the precise definitions and requirements of proof vary among jurisdictions, the requisite elements of fraud as a tort generally are the intentional misrepresentation or concealment of an important fact upon which the victim is meant to rely, and in fact does rely, to the harm of the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/docs/caci/1900/1900.html |title=California Civil Jury Instructions: 1900. Intentional Misrepresentation |publisher=Judicial Council of California |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proving fraud in a court of law is often said to be difficult.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} That difficulty is found, for instance, in that each and every one of the elements of fraud must be proven, that the elements include proving the states of mind of the perpetrator and the victim, and that some jurisdictions require the victim to prove fraud by [[clear and convincing evidence]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The remedies for fraud may include rescission (i.e., reversal) of a fraudulently obtained agreement or transaction, the recovery of a monetary award to compensate for the harm caused, [[punitive damages]] to punish or deter the misconduct, and possibly others.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In cases of a fraudulently induced contract, fraud may serve as a [[Defense (legal)|defense]] in a [[civil action]] for [[breach of contract]] or [[specific performance]] of [[contract]].

Fraud may serve as a basis for a court to invoke its [[equitable jurisdiction]].

==As a criminal offence==

In common law jurisdictions, as a criminal offence, fraud takes many different forms, some general (e.g., theft by false pretense) and some specific to particular categories of victims or misconduct (e.g., [[bank fraud]], [[insurance fraud]], [[forgery]]).  The elements of fraud as a crime similarly vary.  The requisite elements of perhaps the most general form of criminal fraud, theft by false pretense, are the intentional deception of a victim by false representation or pretense with the intent of persuading the victim to part with property and with the victim parting with property in reliance on the representation or pretense and with the perpetrator intending to keep the property from the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/1800/1804.html |title=California Criminal Jury Instructions: 1804. Theft By False Pretense |publisher=Judicial Council of California |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By region==

{{Empty section|date=June 2018}}

===North America===

====Canada====
Section 380(1) of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] provides the general definition for fraud in Canada:

{{quote|
'''380'''. (1) Every one who, by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, whether or not it is a false pretence within the meaning of this Act, defrauds the public or any person, whether ascertained or not, of any property, money or valuable security or any service,

:(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding fourteen years, where the subject-matter of the offence is a testamentary instrument or the value of the subject-matter of the offence exceeds five thousand dollars; or
:(b) is guilty
::(i) of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or
::(ii) of an offence punishable on summary conviction, where the value of the subject-matter of the offence does not exceed five thousand dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-177.html#h-105 |title=Criminal Code, Section 380 |publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}}

In addition to the penalties outlined above, the court can also issue a prohibition order under s. 380.2 (preventing a person from "seeking, obtaining or continuing any employment, or becoming or being a volunteer in any capacity, that involves having authority over the real property, money or valuable security of another person"). It can also make a restitution order under s. 380.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-178.html |title=Criminal Code, Sections 380.2 - 380.3 |publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian courts have held that the offence consists of two distinct elements:

:* A prohibited act of deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means.  In the absence of deceit or falsehood, the courts will look objectively for a "dishonest act"; and
:* The deprivation must be caused by the prohibited act, and deprivation must relate to property, money, valuable security, or any service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Law of Fraud and White Collar Crime in Canada|url = http://www.blakes.com/pdf/Calgary/white_collar/Tab_4The_Law_of_Fraud_and_White_Collar_Crime_in_Canada.pdf|format = Pdf|author = Tony Wong|publisher = [[Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon LLP]]|accessdate = 2012-04-22|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120813020142/http://www.blakes.com/pdf/Calgary/white_collar/Tab_4The_Law_of_Fraud_and_White_Collar_Crime_in_Canada.pdf|archive-date = 2012-08-13|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has held that deprivation is satisfied on proof of detriment, prejudice or risk of prejudice; it is not essential that there be actual loss.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Olan et al.'', [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1175. {{lexum-scc2|1978|2|1175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deprivation of [[confidential information]], in the nature of a [[trade secret]] or copyrighted material that has commercial value, has also been held to fall within the scope of the offence.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Stewart'', [1988] 1 S.C.R. 963. {{lexum-scc2|1988|1|963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====

===== Criminal fraud =====
The proof requirements for criminal fraud charges in the United States are essentially the same as the requirements for other crimes: guilt must be proved beyond a [[reasonable doubt]].  Throughout the United States fraud charges can be misdemeanors or felonies depending on the amount of loss involved.  High value frauds can also include additional penalties.  For example, in California losses of $500,000 or more will result in an extra two, three, or five years in prison in addition to the regular penalty for the fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=186.11 |title=California Code, Penal Code - PEN § 186.11 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=California Legislative Information |publisher=California State Legislature |access-date=9 August 2017 |quote=If the pattern of related felony conduct involves the taking of, or results in the loss by another person or entity of, more than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), the additional term of punishment shall be two, three, or five years in the state prison.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. government's 2006 fraud review concluded that fraud is a significantly under-reported crime, and while various agencies and organizations were attempting to tackle the issue, greater co-operation was needed to achieve a real impact in the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Crimes Report 2006|url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/fcs_report2006|website=FBI|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigations|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of the problem pointed to the need for a small but high-powered body to bring together the numerous counter-fraud initiatives that existed.

According to [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]], [[Loan|auto loan]] application fraud rates in the United States has been steadily rising over the past few years. This type of fraud expected to double from about $2–3 billion in 2015 to $4–6 billion in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Scully |first=Matt |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-10/auto-loan-fraud-is-soaring-in-a-parallel-to-the-housing-bubble |title=Auto Loan Fraud Soars in a Parallel to the Housing Bubble |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=2017-05-10 |accessdate=2017-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Civil fraud =====

Although elements may vary by jurisdiction and the specific allegations made by a plaintiff who files a lawsuit that alleged fraud, typical elements of a fraud case in the United States are that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Fraud, Silent Fraud, and Innocent Misrepresentation|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/fraud.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=6 September 2017|date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Somebody misrepresents a material fact in order to obtain action or forbearance by another person;
#The other person relies upon the misrepresentation; and
#The other person suffers injury as a result of the act or forbearance taken in reliance upon the misrepresentation.

To establish a civil claim of fraud, most jurisdictions in the United States require that each element of a fraud claim be pleaded with particularity and be proved by a [[Burden of proof (law)#Preponderance of the evidence|preponderance of the evidence]],&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Halpert v. Rosenthal, 267 A. 2d 730 (R.I. 1970)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5527501886831013047|website=Google Scholar|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that it is more likely than not that the fraud occurred.

The measure of damages in fraud cases is normally computed using one of two rules:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chang|first1=Stanley Y.|title=The CPA Journal Online|url=http://archives.cpajournal.com/old/15410303.htm|accessdate=6 September 2017|date=April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The "benefit of bargain" rule, which allows for recovery of damages in the amount of the difference between the value of the property had it been as represented and its actual value;
#Out-of-pocket loss, which allows for the recovery of damages in the amount of the difference between the value of what was given and the value of what was received.
[[Damages#Special damages|Special damages]] may be allowed if shown to have been [[Proximate cause|proximately caused]] by defendant's fraud and the damage amounts are proved with [[Asset specificity|specificity]].

Many jurisdictions permit a plaintiff in a fraud case to seek [[Punitive damages|punitive]] or exemplary damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koerner|first1=Theodore G.|title=Contracts: Damages: Punitive Damages Awarded for Breach Accompanied by Fraudulent Act|journal=Michigan Law Journal|date=Jan 1958|volume=56|issue=3|page=448|jstor=1286082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====

In 2016 the estimated value lost through fraud in the UK was £193 billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK fraud costing '£193bn a year', new study suggests|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-36379546|accessdate=6 September 2017|agency=BBC|date=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018 the [[Financial Times]] reported that the value of UK fraud hit a 15-year high of £2.11bn in 2017 according to a study. The article said that the accountancy firm BDO examined reported fraud cases worth more than £50,000 and found that the total number rose to 577 in 2017, compared with 212 in 2003. The study found that the average amount stolen in each incident rose to £3.66m, up from £1.5m in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/7fb80c16-f6c5-11e7-8715-e94187b3017e|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As at November 2017 Fraud is the most common criminal offence in the UK according to a study by Crowe Clark Whitehill, Experian and the Centre for Counter Fraud Studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cityam.com/275550/fraud-costs-uk-economy-gbp190bn-incidents-soar&lt;/ref&gt; The study suggests the UK loses over £190 billion per year to fraud. £190 billion is more than 9% of the UK’s projected GDP for 2017 ($2,496 (£2,080) billion according to Statistics Times). The estimate for fraud in the UK figure is more than the entire GDP of countries such as Romania, Qatar and Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2017/11/13/experian-claims-fraud-costs-uk-190-billion-per-year|title=Experian claims fraud costs UK £190 billion per year - Enterprise Times|date=13 November 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to another review by the UK anti-fraud charity [[Fraud Advisory Panel]] (FAP), business fraud accounted for £144bn, while fraud against individuals was estimated at £9.7bn. The FAP has been particularly critical of the support available from the police to victims of fraud in the UK outside of London. Although victims of fraud are generally referred to the UK's national fraud and cyber crime reporting centre, [[Action Fraud]], the FAP found that there was "little chance" that these crime reports would be followed up with any kind of substantive law enforcement action by UK authorities, according to the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.fraudadvisorypanel.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Fraud-Review-Ten-Years-On-WEB.pdf|title=The Fraud Review Ten Years On|last=Fraud Advisory Panel|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016 it was reported that fraudulent activity levels in the UK increased in the 10 years to 2016 from £52 billion to £193bn.  This figure would be a conservative estimate, since as the former commissioner of the [[City of London Police]], Adrian Leppard, has said, only 1 in 12 such crimes are actually reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2016/july/report-highlights-same-failings-in-fight-against-fraud-10-years-on/|title=Report highlights 'same failings' in fight against fraud 10 years on|website=www.out-law.com|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Toon, director of the NCA's economic crime command, stated in July 2016: "The annual losses to the UK from fraud are estimated to be more than £190bn". Figures released in October 2015 from the Crime Survey of England and Wales found that there had been 5.1 million incidents of fraud in England and Wales in the previous year, affecting an estimated one in 12 adults and making it the most common form of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36825605|title=UK fraud police release wanted list|date=2016-07-18|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in July 2016, the [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) stated "Almost six million fraud and cyber crimes were committed last year in England and Wales and estimated there were two million computer misuse offences and 3.8 million fraud offences in the 12 months to the end of March 2016." Fraud affects one in ten people in the UK. According to the ONS most frauds relate to bank account fraud.  These figures are separate from the headline estimate that another 6.3 million crimes (distinct from frauds) were perpetrated in the UK against adults in the year to March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36854413|title=Nearly six million fraud and cyber crimes last year, ONS says|date=2016-07-21|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fraud was not included in a "Crime Harm Index" published by the [[Office for National Statistics]] in 2016.  Michael Levi, professor of criminology at Cardiff University, remarked in August 2016 that it was ‘deeply regrettable’ fraud is being left out of the first index despite being the most common crime reported to police in the UK. Levi said ‘If you’ve got some categories that are excluded, they are automatically left out of the police’s priorities.’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3750986/new-crime-index-used-police-says-burglary-twice-bad-child-abduction.html|title=Revealed: New 'crime index' used by police says burglary is twice as bad as child abduction - and bike theft is more serious than drug possession|last=Beckford|first=Martin|date=21 August 2016|work=Daily Mail Online|publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd|access-date=18 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chief of the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] (NAO), Sir Anyas Morse has also said “For too long, as a low-value but high-volume crime, online fraud has been overlooked by government, law enforcement and industry. It is now the most commonly experienced crime in England and Wales and demands an urgent response.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Online fraud costs public billions but is still not a police priority, says watchdog|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/30/online-costs-public-billions-but-is-still-not-a-police-priority-says-watchdog|accessdate=6 September 2017|agency=Press Association|publisher=The Guardian|date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====England, Wales, and Northern Ireland=====
Since 2007, fraud in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] has been covered by the [[Fraud Act 2006]]. The Act was given [[Royal Assent]] on 8 November 2006, and came into effect on 15 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;The Fraud Act 2006 (Commencement) Order 2006 - SI 2006 No. 3200 (C.112) {{ISBN|0-11-075407-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act gives a statutory definition of the criminal offence of fraud, defining it in three classes—fraud by false representation, fraud by failing to disclose information, and fraud by abuse of position. It provides that a person found guilty of fraud is liable to a fine or imprisonment for up to twelve months on [[summary conviction]] (six months in [[Northern Ireland]]), or a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years on conviction on [[indictment]]. This Act largely replaces the laws relating to obtaining property by deception, obtaining a pecuniary advantage and other offences that were created under the [[Theft Act 1978]].

=====Scotland=====
In [[Scots law]], fraud is covered under the common law and a number of statutory offences. The main fraud offences are common law fraud, uttering, embezzlement and statutory frauds. The Fraud Act 2006 does not apply in Scotland.

=====Serious Fraud Office=====
{{Main|Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)}}
The [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)]] is an arm of the Government of the United Kingdom, accountable to the Attorney-General.

=====National Fraud Authority=====
The [[National Fraud Authority]] (NFA) was, until 2014, a government agency co-ordinating the counter-fraud response in the UK.

===== Cifas =====
{{Main|Cifas}}
Cifas is a British fraud prevention service, a not-for-profit membership organisation for all sectors that enables organisations to share and access fraud data using their databases. Cifas is dedicated to the prevention of fraud, including internal fraud by staff, and the identification of financial and related crime.

==Cost==
The typical organization loses five percent of its annual revenue to fraud, with a median loss of $160,000. Frauds committed by owners and executives were more than nine times as costly as employee fraud.  The industries most commonly affected are banking, manufacturing, and government.&lt;ref name="acfe"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Report to the Nations on Occupational Fraud and Abuse|year=2010|url=http://www.acfe.com/rttn/2010-highlights.asp|publisher=[[Association of Certified Fraud Examiners]]|archivedate=July 7, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707080711/http://www.acfe.com/rttn/2010-highlights.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of fraudulent acts==
[[File:USMC-01464.jpg|thumb|The highly decorated fake uniform worn by a man [[Military imposter|impersonating]] a "Marine" caught by two gunnery sergeants at Times Square in New York City, New York]]
[[Image:Workathomead.jpg|thumb|A possibly fraudulent "work from home" advertisement]]

The falsification of documents, forgery or counterfeiting are types of fraud.  The theft of one's personal information, like Social Security number, or identity is type of fraud.  
Fraud can be committed through many media, including [[Mail and wire fraud|mail]], [[Mail and wire fraud|wire]], [[phone fraud|phone]], and the [[Internet]] ([[computer crime]] and [[Internet fraud]]). International dimensions of the web and ease with which users can hide their location, the difficulty of checking identity and legitimacy online, and the simplicity with which [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]] can divert browsers to dishonest sites and steal [[credit card]] details have all contributed to the very rapid growth of Internet fraud. In some countries, tax fraud is also prosecuted under false billing or tax forgery.&lt;ref&gt;"Tax Fraud and the Problem of a Constitutionality Acceptable Definition of Religion". BJ Casino. ''American Criminal Law. Rev.'', 1987&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been fraudulent "discoveries", e.g., in [[scientific fraud|science]], to gain prestige rather than immediate monetary gain.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Anti-fraud movements==

Beyond laws that aim at prevention of fraud, there are also governmental and non-governmental organizations that aim to fight fraud.  Between 1911 and 1933, 47 states adopted the so-called [[Blue sky law|Blue Sky Laws]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Speech by SEC Staff: remarks at the F. Hodge O'neal Corporate and securities Law symposium|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/spch022103smc.htm |website=sec.gov |date = 21 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These laws were enacted and enforced at the state level and regulated the offering and sale of [[security (finance)|securities]] to protect the public from fraud.  Though the specific provisions of these laws varied among states, they all required the registration of all securities offerings and sales, as well as of every U.S. [[stockbroker]] and brokerage firm.&lt;ref name="bluesky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seclaw.com/bluesky.htm |title=Blue Sky Laws |publisher=Seclaw.com |date=2007-07-07 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these Blue Sky laws were generally found to be ineffective. To increase public trust in the capital markets the [[President of the United States]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], established the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945)|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/mep/displaydoc.cfm?docid=erpn-fdr|website=gwu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for the creation of the SEC was to regulate the [[stock market]] and prevent [[corporate abuses]] relating to the offering and sale of securities and corporate reporting. The SEC was given the power to license and regulate stock exchanges, the companies whose securities traded on them, and the brokers and dealers who conducted the trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")|url=http://learn.advfn.com/index.php?title=Stock_Market_Regulation|website=learn.advfn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
[[File:White Van Speaker Scam fraudulent MSRP.jpg|thumb|A fraudulent Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price on a speaker]]
{{see|Data analysis techniques for fraud detection}}
For detection of fraudulent activities on the large scale, massive use of (online) [[data analysis]] is required, in particular [[predictive analytics#Fraud detection|predictive analytics]] or forensic analytics.  Forensic analytics is the use of electronic data to reconstruct or detect financial fraud.  The steps in the process are data collection, data preparation, data analysis, and the preparation of a report and possibly a presentation of the results.  Using computer-based analytic methods [[Mark Nigrini|Nigrini's]] wider goal is the detection of fraud, errors, anomalies, inefficiencies, and biases which refer to people gravitating to certain dollar amounts to get past internal control thresholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Forensic Analytics|url=http://www.analytics-magazine.org/july-august-2013/835-forensic-analytics|website=analytics-magazine.org|date = July–August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analytic tests usually start with high-level data overview tests to spot highly significant [[outlier|irregularities]].  In a recent purchasing card application these tests identified a purchasing card transaction for 3,000,000 Costa Rica Colons.  This was neither a fraud nor an error, but it was a highly unusual amount for a purchasing card transaction.  These high-level tests include tests related to Benford's Law and possibly also those statistics known as descriptive statistics.  These high-tests are always followed by more focused tests to look for small samples of highly irregular transactions.  The familiar methods of [[correlation]] and [[time-series analysis]] can also be used to detect fraud and other irregularities.  Forensic analytics also includes the use of a fraud risk-scoring model to identify high risk forensic units (customers, employees, locations, insurance claims and so on).  Forensic analytics also includes suggested tests to identify financial statement irregularities, but the general rule is that analytic methods alone are not too successful at detecting financial statement fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Gadhimai festival''' was a sacrificial ceremony that was held every 5 years at the [[Gadhimai Temple]] of [[Bariyarpur, Bara|Bariyarpur]], in [[Bara District]], about {{convert|100|mi}} south of the capital [[Kathmandu]], and about  {{convert|4.35|mi}} east of headquarter of Bara district [[kalaiya]] city, in the southern [[Nepal]], near the Indo-Nepal border, adjacent to [[Bihar]]. It was primarily celebrated by the [[Madhesi people|Madheshi]] and [[Bihari people|Bihari]] people. The event involves the large-scale [[Animal sacrifice|sacrificial slaughter of animals]] including [[water buffalo]]es, pigs, goats, chickens, and pigeons &amp;ndash; with the goal of pleasing Gadhimai, the [[Devi|goddess]] of power. People also offer coconuts, sweets, red colour clothes, etc.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8375591.stm|title=Devotees flock to Nepal animal sacrifice festival|last=Jolly|first=Joanna |date=24 November 2009|work=BBC|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that 50,000 animals were sacrificed during the Gadhimai festival of 2009. In 2015, it was erroneously reported that Nepal's temple trust planned to cancel all future animal sacrifice at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ram Chandra|first1=Shah|title=Gadhimai Temple Trust Chairman, Mr Ram Chandra Shah, on the decision to stop holding animal sacrifices during the Gadhimai festival.Later the trust denied the decision ,as per trust such decision was obtained forcefully by animal right.

A month before the ritual in 2009, the Madheshi politicians realized there would be a "severe shortage" of goats for the ritual sacrifice, as well as for the consumption of [[goat meat]] during the festival. They began a radio campaign urging farmers to sell their animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8256723.stm|title=Nepal hit by severe goat shortage|date=15 September 2009|work=BBC |accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival started in the first week of November 2009 and ended in the first week of December (up to [[Makar Sankranti|makar sankranti]]), the fair has a custom of animal sacrifice that occurred on November 24 and 25 in the year 2009, with the temple's head priest performing ritual sacrifice called ''Saptabali'', which includes the sacrifice of white mice, pigeons, roosters, ducks, swine and male water buffaloes. More than 20,000 buffaloes were sacrificed on the first day.&lt;ref name="nn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nepalnews.com/index.php/politics-archive/19-news/general/2577-over-20000-buffaloes-slaughtered-in-gadhimai-festival|title=Over 20,000 buffaloes slaughtered in Gadhimai festival |date=25 November 2009|work=NepalNews.com|accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 250,000 animals were sacrificed during the Gadhimai festival of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/24/hindu-sacrifice-gadhimai-festival-nepal|title=Hindu sacrifice of 250,000 animals begins|date=24 November 2009|accessdate=6 December 2014|work=The Guardian|last=Lang|first=Olivia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual killings were performed by more than 200 men in a concrete [[slaughterhouse]] near the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-11/25/content_12536544.htm|title= Gadhimai festival begins in central Nepal |last=Xiang |first=Zhang |work=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies and objections==
[[File:Nepal-animal-cruelty-2.jpg|thumb|Slaugthering of animals]]

The festival has prompted numerous protests by animal rights activists and Nepalese Hindus from Hill region.&lt;ref name=TKP&gt;{{cite news|title=Never Again|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2010/11/23/oped/never-again/215205/|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|last=Shah|first=Pramada|date=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tdifferently&gt;{{cite web|title=Gadhimai Festival:Why it must never happen Again|url=http://www.think-differently-about-sheep.com/The_Gadhimai_festival_Why_it-must-never_happen-Again.htm|publisher=Think Differently|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, activists made several attempts to stop the ritual, including [[Brigitte Bardot]] and [[Maneka Gandhi]], who wrote to the Nepalese government asking them to stop the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8369740.stm|title= Bardot appeal over animal slaughter at Nepal festival|date=20 November 2009|work=BBC|accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/nov/25/gadhimai-animal-sacrifice-nepal |title= The Gadhimai sacrifice is grotesque |first = Anil |last = Bhanot |date= 25 November 2009|publisher =The Guardian |accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A government official commented that they would not "interfere in the centuries-old tradition of the Madheshi people."&lt;ref name="th"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article53883.ece|title=Gadhimai festival begins despite protests in Nepal |date=24 November 2009|work=The Hindu|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ram Bahadur Bomjon]], claimed by some of his supporters to be the [[List of Buddha claimants|reincarnation of the Buddha]], said that he would attempt to stop the sacrifice at the festival, preaching non-violence and offering a blessing at the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Sacrifice of 200,000 Animals Proceeds Despite Pleas, Prayers | url = http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/nov2009/2009-11-22-02.asp | publisher = Environment News Service |date=22 November 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="myrepublica"&gt;{{cite news| title = Buddha boy fails to turn up at Gadhimai |url = http://archives.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&amp;news_id=11992 |date=20 November 2009|work=Republica |accessdate=25 November 2009|last=Lamichhane|first=Upendra}}&lt;/ref&gt; His promise prompted the government to send additional forces to prevent any incident.&lt;ref name="myrepublica" /&gt;&lt;!--, but Bomjon was not permitted by Indian pilgrims and Madheshi religious authorities to attend. (This will need a verifiable source)--&gt;

After the festival, the meat, bones and hides of the animals are sold to companies in India and Nepal.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; &lt;!-- [Unsourced text] Members of the local untouchable 'dalit' [[caste]] 'Chamar' used to consume the buffalo meat from the fair. This year despite the protest from Dalit groups and calls to boycott consumption of the meat by dalits, many dalits did arrive at the temple premises and took away the meat for consumption. --&gt;

In October 2014, Gauri Maulekhi ([[People for Animals Uttarakhand]] (PFA) trustee and [[Humane Society International]] (HSI) consultant) filed a petition against the illegal transportation of animals from India to Nepal for slaughter. After this, the [[Supreme Court of India]] passed an interim order directing the [[Government of India]] to prevent animals being illegally transported across the border for sacrifice at Gadhimai. The court also asked animal protection groups and others to devise an action plan to ensure the court order is implemented.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=India confiscates hundreds of animals at Nepal border ahead of Gadhimai festival |url=http://www.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-confiscates-hundreds-of-animals-at-Nepal-border-ahead-of-Gadhimai-festival/articleshow/45222644.cms |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150310003945/http://www.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/India-confiscates-hundreds-of-animals-at-Nepal-border-ahead-of-Gadhimai-festival/articleshow/45222644.cms |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 March 2015 |publisher=Times of India |date=20 November 2014 |last=Sigdel |first=Chahana }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NG Jayasimha, HSI India's MD, visited Nepal to ensure the ban is being adhered to. In an interview to the [[Times of India]] he said, "I am very pleased that we were able to sit down with the Nepali politicians, to speak up for the hundreds of thousands of innocent animals who are condemned to an utterly unjustified beheading at Gadhimai. We also spoke directly to the Gadhimai temple and the local magistrate, so they can be in no doubt of the overwhelming call for compassion. We sincerely hope that they will act to stop this unnecessary bloodshed".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On July 28, 2015 this festival has been banned by HSI India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-now-on-no-more-animal-sacrifice-at-nepal-s-gadhimai-festival/article1-1374025.aspx|title=From now on, no more animal sacrifice at Nepal's Gadhimai festival|date=28 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/np/2072/4/13/full-story/413644.html|title='गढीमाईमा बलि नदिइने निर्णय छैन्'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
The Indian [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] has directed the states of [[Bihar]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]] to monitor and make sure no animals get to [[Nepal]] for the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ekantipur.com/2014/10/13/editors-pick/gadaimai-slaughter-bihar-up-asked-to-check-animal-flow-into-bara/396254.html|title = Gadaimai slaughter: Bihar, UP asked to check animal flow into Bara|date = 13 October 2014|accessdate = 29 November 2014|newspaper = Kantipur|last=Gohain|first=Manash Pratim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter Davies''' (15 July 1761 – 5 December 1849), commonly known by his [[bardic name]] '''Gwallter Mechain''' ("Walter of [[Mechain]]"), was a [[Wales|Welsh]] poet, editor, translator, [[antiquary]] and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] clergyman.

Davies was born at Y Wern, near Tomen y Castell, [[Llanfechain]], [[Montgomeryshire]]. He was educated at the village school and was to become a [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]], but with the help of the poet [[Owen Jones (antiquary)|Owain Myfyr]] went to [[All Souls College, Oxford]], graduating in 1795. He took [[Holy Orders]] and became a [[Church of England]] curate in the parish of [[Meifod]], Montgomeryshire, moving in 1799 to [[Ysbyty Ifan]], Denbighshire where he met and married his wife Mary. He went on to study at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], gaining his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=DVS803W|name=Mechain, Gwallter}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the living of [[Llanwyddelan]] and became vicar of [[Manafon]] in Montgomeryshire where he remained for 30 years and did most of his literary work.

In 1797 he had begun a [[General View of Agriculture county surveys|survey]] of the agriculture and economy of [[North Wales]], which was published in two volumes in 1810 and 1813. This was followed in 1815 by a report on [[South Wales]] in collaboration with [[Iolo Morganwg]] (Edward Williams). He contributed to [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]]'s ''Topographical Dictionary of Wales'' (1833).&lt;ref name="Walter Davies and Board of Agriculture"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=598 | title = Walter Davies ('Gwallter Mechain') and The Board of Agriculture | accessdate = 2008-05-05 | publisher = [[The National Library of Wales]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837, he moved to the [[parish]] of [[Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant]], where he died in 1849 and lies buried in the parish churchyard.

Davies was closely associated with the London Welsh, especially the [[Gwyneddigion Society]], and the revival of the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion|Cymmrodorion Society]] in 1820. He was a keen supporter of [[eisteddfod]]au, where he won many prizes, and he played an important role in establishing provincial eisteddfodic societies.

== Incidents ==
The fire started at around 6 PM on July 3, 2018, near the Basalt Shooting Range. It was believed to have been started by Richard Karl Miller, 23, and Allison Sarah Marcus, 22, who were using illegal [[tracer rounds]] at the Shooting Range during Stage 2 fire restrictions in Eagle County. They both face 4th degree arson charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kdvr.com/2018/07/04/2-people-shooting-tracer-rounds-accused-of-starting-lake-christine-fire/|title=2 people shooting tracer rounds accused of starting Lake Christine Fire|date=2018-07-05|publisher=FOX31 Denver|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shooting range had not been closed down by [[Colorado Parks and Wildlife]] (who operates the shooting range) before the fire started, despite the fire restrictions.

The fire destroyed three homes on and along the mountside which the fire burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://denver.cbslocal.com/2018/07/05/lake-christine-fire-colorado-wildfires-basalt-el-jebel-evacuations/|title=New Evacuations, 3 Homes Destroyed By Lake Christine Fire Near Basalt|publisher=CBS Denver|date=2018-07-05|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evacuations ==
500 homes were evacuated under mandatory evacuations in Missouri Heights, the El Jebel Mobile Home Park and on other parts of Basalt Mountain. These evacuations were later lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.westword.com/news/lake-christine-fire-update-july-2018-10505899|title=Lake Christine Fire Update: 500 Homes Evacuated as Burning Acreage Grows|last=Roberts|first=Michael|date=2018-07-05|work=Westword|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Filming for the series began on June 26, 2017 for an eight-episode first season.&lt;ref name=THR3/&gt; In April 2016, Dick Wolf and NBC announced they were working on the series, a first season being based on the Mendendez brothers murder case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/04/law-order-true-crime-anthology-series-the-menendez-brothers-murders-dick-wolf-nbc-1201733198/|title=NBC &amp; Dick Wolf Developing 'Law &amp; Order: True Crime' Anthology Series; 1st Season To Tackle Menendez Brothers Murders|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline Hollywood|date=April 6, 2016|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second season is yet to be confirmed, but Dick Wolf mentioned he has plenty of ideas for the show and a possible storyline if there is a second season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/08/dick-wolf-law-order-true-crime-menendez-murder-tca-1202141316/|title=Dick Wolf Already Mulling Future ‘Law &amp; Order True Crime’ Topics, Predicting Bullseye With Menendez Murder Debut|date=August 3, 2017 |last=de Moraes|first=Lisa|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; “This is unique for me, after 27 years of Law &amp; Order,” Dick Wolf told TV critics at TCA in an interview. “This is taken from the headlines; we‘ve made some great shows ripped from the headlines, but this is on a different level.” An idea for a second season storyline includes the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] of 1995. "Just before the [Television Critics Association summer press tour], I had mentioned to him the [[Timothy McVeigh|Tim McVeigh]] case, and his eyes lit up," Rene Balcer says of Wolf's reaction. "Because Dick and I were together, we were in the same office when the bomb went off in Oklahoma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/law-order-true-crime-season-2-case-1056021|title='Law &amp; Order True Crime' Boss Discusses Possible Season 2 Case|date=November 14, 2017|accessdate=January 9, 2018|last=Stanhope|first=Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Liberal Revolution of 1820''' ({{lang-pt|Revolução Liberal}}) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] political revolution that erupted in 1820. It began with a military insurrection in the city of [[Porto]], in northern Portugal, that quickly and peacefully spread to the rest of the country. The Revolution resulted in the return in 1821 of the Portuguese Court to Portugal from [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], where it [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|had fled]] during the [[Peninsular War]], and initiated a [[constitution]]al period in which the 1822 [[Constitution]] was ratified and implemented. The movement's [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas had an important influence on Portuguese society and political organization in the nineteenth century.

== Historical background ==
From 1807 to 1811 Napoleonic French forces invaded Portugal three times. As a result, the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Portuguese royal family was transferred]] to the Portuguese colony of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], where it remained until 1821. From Brazil, the Portuguese king [[John VI of Portugal|João VI]] ruled his [[Portuguese Empire|transcontinental empire]] for thirteen years.

Following the defeat of the French forces in 1814, Portugal experienced a prolonged period of political turmoil, in which many sought greater self-rule for the Portuguese people. Eventually this unrest put an end to the King's long stay in Brazil, when his return to Portugal was demanded by the revolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;CasaHistória website, [http://www.casahistoria.net/Brazil.htm#Independence "Independence and Empire"], retrieved 12 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the Portuguese had participated in the defeat of the French, the country found itself virtually a colony of Brazil or British [[protectorate]]. The officers of the [[Portuguese Army]] resented British control of the Portuguese armed forces. In addition the 1808 ''Decree of the Opening of Ports to Friendly Nations'', practically brought an end to the so-called "colonial pact" (''See, [[Mercantilism]]''), and the two ''Treaties of 1810'', which guaranteed favored status to British products entering Portugal, decimated the commerce of cities like Porto and Lisbon and set off a deep economic crisis which affected its [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref&gt;Birmingham, 108–110; Nowell, 181–182.&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Porto, with a strong, dynamic bourgeoisie and with liberal tradition, was the place where the Liberal Revolution began.

After Napoleon's definite defeat in 1815, a clandestine Supreme Regenerative Council of Portugal and the Algarve was formed in Lisbon by army officers and [[Freemasonry|freemasons]], headed by General [[Gomes Freire de Andrade]]—[[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of the [[Freemasonry_in_Portugal#Grande_Oriente_Lusitano|Grande Oriente Lusitano]] and former general under Napoleon until his defeat in 1814—with the objective to end British control of the country and to promote "the salvation and independence" of the ''[[Fatherland|pátria]]''. In its brief existence the movement attempted to introduce liberalism in Portugal, although it ultimately failed to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Birmingham, 111.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1817 three masons, João de Sá Pereira Soares, Morais Sarmento and José Andrade Corvo, denounced the movement to the authorities, who arrested many suspects, including Freire de Andrade, who was charged with conspiracy against [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], represented in [[continental Portugal]] by a regency, then overseen by the British military authority headed by [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Carr Beresford]].

In October 1817, the Regency found the twelve of the accused guilty of treason against the nation and sentenced them to death by hanging. Beresford intended to suspend the sentence until it was confirmed by John VI, but the Regency, judging that such a move was a slight to its authority, ordered their immediate execution, which took place on 18 October at Campo do Santana (today, [[Campo dos Mártires da Pátria]], "Field of the [[Martyr]]s of the [[Fatherland]]").&lt;ref&gt;Pombo, Rocha. ''História do Brasil'' vol. 4, p. 12. The executed were José Ribeiro Pinto, Major José da Fonseca Neves, Maximiano Dias Ribeiro (all freemasons); and José Joaquim Pinto da Silva, Major José Campello de Miranda, Colonel Manuel Monteiro de Carvalho, Henrique José Garcia de Moraes, António Cabral Calheiros Furtado de Lemos, Manuel Inácio de Figueiredo, and Pedro Ricardo de Figueiró (all possible freemasons).&lt;/ref&gt; Freire de Andrade was executed on the same day at the [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|São Julião da Barra Fort]]. The executions sparked protests against Beresford and the Regency and intensified anti-British feeling in the country.

A couple of years after the executions, Beresford left for Brazil to ask the King for more resources and powers to suppress the lingering presence of what he called "[[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinism]]," which were granted to him. In his absence, the Revolution of Porto broke out in 1820, and upon his arrival from Brazil, he was forbidden to disembark in Lisbon.

==Revolution==
[[File:Manuel Fernandes Tomás, Manuel Borges Carneiro, e Joaquim António de Aguiar (1926) - Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro (Palácio de São Bento).png|thumb|left|Allegory of the parlamentarians of 1822: {{ill|Manuel Fernandes Tomás|pt}}, {{ill|Manuel Borges Carneiro|pt}}, and [[Joaquim António de Aguiar]] ([[Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro]], 1926)]]
Influenced by the concurrent [[Trienio Liberal]] Revolution in Spain of 1 January 1820, a liberal revolution started in Porto, quickly spreading without resistance to several other Portuguese cities and towns, culminating with the revolt of Lisbon. The revolutionaries demanded the immediate return of the royal court to [[continental Portugal]] in order to "restore the metropolitan dignity." In fact, the liberal revolution of 1820 not only forced the return of the King but also demanded a [[constitutional monarchy]] to be set up in Portugal. The revolutionaries also sought to restore Portuguese exclusivity in the trade with Brazil, reverting Brazil to the status of a colony, officially to be reduced to a "Principality of Brazil," instead of the [[Kingdom of Brazil]], which it had been for the past five years. The Brazilian kingdom had legally been an equal, constituent part of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]. The revolutionaries organized the election of a constitutional assembly which debated the nature of the future government. The elections resulted in deputies were primarily from the professions (lawyers, professors) and not from the merchants who had spearheaded the revolution. Professionals now took the lead in the revolution. The constitution that was approved in 1822 was closely modeled on the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;Birmingham, 111–113; Nowell, 182–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After John VI returned to Portugal in 1821, his heir-apparent, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]], became regent of the Kingdom of Brazil. Following a series of political events and disputes, [[Brazilian Declaration of Independence|Brazil declared its independence]] from Portugal on 7 September 1822. On 12 October 1822, Pedro was acclaimed as the first Emperor of Brazil. He was crowned on 1 December 1822. Portugal recognized Brazil's sovereignty in 1825.

In 1823, the first revolt against the constitutional order was organized by [[Miguel of Portugal|Prince Miguel]] and Brigadier [[João Carlos Saldanha de Oliveira Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha|João Carlos Saldanha]], which managed to close the parliament and to convince King João VI to recall Beresford as an advisor. In 1826 João VI died with no clear heir, further destabilizing the nation. Upon seizing the throne, Miguel led another revolt against the constitutional government, triggering six years of [[Liberal Wars|civil wars]], which pitted him against his brother, now Pedro IV of Portugal, who headed the liberal faction.&lt;ref&gt;Birmingham, 116–117; Nowell, 184–188.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lovemobile''' is a popular name for a [[Float (parade)|float]]. These lovemobiles are trucks with flatbed carrying sound equipment, a [[DJ]] or other live act, [[dancing|dancers]] and props, which is used as a central element at [[technoparade]]s. The setup and decoration of a lovemobile takes place in the days or weeks preceding the event. The lovemobile is driven at walking pace through a crowd of [[rave]]rs as they dance to music powered by the truck's electrical system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2491">'''Madrigal comedy''' is a term for a kind of entertainment music of the late 16th century in [[Italy]], in which groups of related, generally ''[[a cappella]]'' [[madrigal (music)|madrigals]] were sung consecutively, generally telling a story, and sometimes having a loose dramatic plot.  It is an important element in the [[origins of opera]].  The term is of 20th-century origin, popularised by [[Alfred Einstein]].

The first collection of madrigals, sung as a set and telling a coherent (and highly comic) story, was ''Il cicalamento delle donne al bucato'' (the gossip of wives in the laundry), by [[Alessandro Striggio]], which was written in 1567.  Later madrigal comedies are sometimes divided into acts, including a prologue, and while not "acted" in the sense of an opera, they may have been performed on stage with elaborate painted backdrops (for example, there is an existing woodcut showing the prologue of [[Orazio Vecchi|Orazio Vecchi's]] ''[[L'Amfiparnaso]]'' (1597):  a singer is evidently in costume in a backdrop showing a city street).  Vecchi's direction in the score, however, is for the singers not to act, but for the audience to fill in the action internally, using their imagination.  He speaks to the audience in the prologue to the work:  "the spectacle I speak of is to be seen in your mind; it enters not through your eyes, but through your ears:  instead of looking, listen, and be silent."

The form was popular especially in the 1590s and few years after 1600, only in Italy, but seems to have fallen out of favor with the advent of opera right at 1600, although ''a cappella'' madrigals were also disappearing at this time as well.  The music of madrigal comedies is light, and the subject matter was invariably comic.

Principal composers of madrigal comedy included [[Alessandro Striggio]], [[Adriano Banchieri]], [[Giovanni Croce]], and [[Orazio Vecchi]].

'''Maattu Pongal''' ({{lang-ta|மாட்டுப் பொங்கல்}}) is the third day of the four-day Pongal festival. According to the Gregorian calendar it is normally celebrated on January 15 but sometimes it is celebrated on January 16. In the [[tamil calendar|Tamil calendar]], this corresponds to the second day of the Tamil month Thai.

Though the name of the festival is specific to [[Tamil Nadu]], it is also celebrated in other southern Indian states such as [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]. Makar Sankranti is a festival that marks the start of northern declination (called [[Uttarayana]] in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]) of the [[Sun]] from the Zodiaca sign of [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] (Sanskrit name: [[Dhanurmas]]) to [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] (Sanskrit: Makara), which according to [[Hindu calendar]] usually falls on 14 January.

In Tamil, the word “Mattu” means bull and this day of Pongal is for celebration of the cattle, particularly bulls that play a vital role by working hard to help the farmers to raise crops on their fields, falls on the following day, 15 January. The festival is also observed by ethnic [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Tamil]] population of [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=Tourist&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tourist Guide to Tamil Nadu|page=9|accessdate=2009-12-31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGxbJqdEQrwC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=mattu+pongal&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=10#v=onepage&amp;q=mattu%20pongal&amp;f=false|publisher=Sura Books|isbn=81-7478-177-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bhalla&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bhalla|first=Kartar Singh|title= Let's Know Festivals of India|work=Pongal|page=16|accessdate=2009-12-31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WORYY5Vl0ygC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Mattu+Pongal&amp;ei=K9o0S-2tMYzSkwTg9f23AQ&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Mattu%20Pongal&amp;f=false|publisher= Star Publications|year=2005|isbn=81-7650-165-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mattu&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pongalfestival.org/mattu-pongal.html|title=Mattu Pongal|accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mean&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pongalfestival.org/meaning-significance.html|title= Pongal: Meaning &amp; Significance|accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Verma&gt;{{Cite book|last=Verma|first=Manish|title= Fasts and festivals of India|work=Pongal|pages=74–75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4gzFFLdBoYC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=mattu+pongal&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=13#v=onepage&amp;q=mattu%20pongal&amp;f=false|publisher= Diamond Pocket Books (P) Ltd.|year=2000|isbn=81-7182-076-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival day is also a special occasion when the landlord and the peasant, rich and poor, old and young all dine together in a spirit of bonhomie without any restraint of caste and creed. The festival is thus an occasion when the fresh harvests from the fields are shared in the form of food and sweets not only with the community but also with animals and birds. It also represents the change of season.&lt;ref name=mattu/&gt;&lt;ref name=Verma/&gt;

An important village sport, called the [[Jallikattu]] or Manji Virattu, an integral part of the Mattu Pongal festival is observed with enthusiasm and expectations in the villages of Tamil Nadu. This sport is held generally in the evening of the Mattu Pongal day. In the past, it was the day when fierce bulls were chased by young youths of the village to retrieve the money that was tied to the horns of the bulls. In some villages it was held one day after the Mattu Pongal day, on the Kannum Pongal day.

==Name and legend==
Mattu Pongal is made up of two words; 'Mattu' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] means "bull". Pongal, also in Tamil Language, literally means "boiled rice" (a rice and lentil dish) but metaphorically means prosperity.&lt;ref name =journal&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-cKAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Mattu+Pongal&amp;dq=Mattu+Pongal&amp;ei=K9o0S-2tMYzSkwTg9f23AQ&amp;cd=10|title= Journal of social research, Volume 11|work=Mattu pongal|pages=152–153 |accessdate=2009-12-26|publisher= Council of Social and Cultural Research, Bihar, Ranchi University.

According to a legend linked to Mattu Pongal, god [[Shiva]] sent his bull [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] ([[vahana|mount]] of Shiva and his gate keeper) from heaven to the earth to give his message to people that they should have an oil bath every day and eat once a month. Instead, Nandi wrongly advised people to take an oil bath once a month and eat every day. Shiva was annoyed with this advice related to food and in fit of rage, banished Nandi to permanently live on earth and help the farmers to produce the extra food crops needed for people to eat every day.&lt;ref name = Bhalla/&gt;

==Observance==

[[File:Pongal street decorations.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Kolam]] drawing on Mattu Pongal day]]

Observance of Mattu Pongal is part of the Pongal festival. Pongal is generally a four-day festival of fervent celebrations (during 2010, it will be held from 13 to 16 January) marking the officially declared Tamil New Year day, the beginning of the month of ''Thai'' starting with 14 January every year, as per [[Tamil Calendar]]. The first day is called ''Bhogi'' – the last day of [[Dhanurmas]] (month of [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]]), a preparatory day before the Pongal and is in honour of god [[Indra]], the king of heaven. On this day it is spring cleaning, as people decorate their homes, buy new vessels and burn old and unwanted items. [[Pongal]], the main festival, also called the ''Perum Pongal'' (big festival), is the second day when the Sun is worshipped signifying the first day of the month of Makara or Capricornus. It is celebrated as [[Makara Sankranti]] or simply "Sankranti" in the rest of the country. This is followed by the 'Mattu Pongal' celebration on the third day when bulls, cows and other farm animals are worshipped. The fourth day is the 'Kannum Pongal' or 'Kanru Pongal' (Calf Pongal) festival when calves are fed. However, the name 'Kannum' also denotes that on this day people visit elders in the villages or towns seeking their blessings.&lt;ref name=Tourist/&gt;&lt;ref name = Bhalla/&gt;&lt;ref name=house&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tn.gov.in/pressrelease/archives/pr2009/pr150109/pongal_celebration_TN_House.pdf|format=pdf|title= Pongal and Tamil – New Year Celebrations|accessdate=2009-12-26|publisher=Government of Tamil Nadu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On each of the four days festival, [[Kolam]] or threshold drawings are drawn with coloured rice powder or chalk powder, in the front yard of the houses, after due washing of the yard. On the first day images of rice are drawn, on the second day good luck signs of Sun are drawn and the Mattu Pongal day Kolam depicts cows also.&lt;ref name="Bartock"/&gt;

On all four days, Shiva's consort [[Parvati]] and their son [[Ganesha]] are worshipped and the Pongal – the rice preparation – is offered to them in the [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] and thereafter to the cattle. The neck of the pot in which Pongal rice is prepared is tied with fresh turmeric leaves and pieces of sugarcane. Ingredients cooked in the pot consist of rice, green gram and milk. While cooking, the overflow of milk is particularly observed as it has significance to the householder. If the milk over flows on the right side of the pot, it is considered an auspicious augury.&lt;ref name= Jagannathan&gt;{{Cite book|last= Jagannathan|first= Maithily|title= South Indian Hindu festivals and traditions|work=Pongal|page=141|accessdate=2010-01-01|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcIrkKUJH9QC&amp;pg=RA1-PA141&amp;dq=Mattu+Pongal&amp;lr=&amp;ei=5OU0S6uREaGklQTXx6mmAQ&amp;cd=30#v=onepage&amp;q=Mattu%20Pongal&amp;f=false|publisher= Abhinav Publications|year=2005|isbn=81-7017-415-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, an image of Ganesha is crafted with cow-dung. This crafted Ganesha is then bedecked with arugampul (kind of grass), thumbai (white flowers) and avaram (yellow flowers). The pongal cooked in mud pots are placed on the floor where a Kolam is drawn and skirted with red sand. Then, pongal-rice along with turmeric, ginger, sugar cane, yellow garlands and a stick that is used to drive the bulls are also placed as offering to Ganesha.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In some practices, Pongal is celebrated for three days with Kannum Pongal or Kannu Pongal observed concurrently with the Mattu Pongal. Sisters symbolically offer small part of the rice dishes prepared for the festival or coloured balls of cooked rice to crows and other birds such as sparrows, as a special prayer for the well being of their brothers. While making this offering to crows, they call out with words in Tamil, ‘Kakai Ku Pudi, Kuruvi Ku Pudi’, which literally means “this rice ball is for the crow, this rice ball is for the sparrow.”&lt;ref name="mean"/&gt;&lt;ref name= Jagannathan/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson p.171"&gt;Wilson p.171&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the Mattu Pongal day, cattle are washed, their horns painted and decorated with shining metal caps. Multi-coloured beads, tinkling bells, sheaves of corn and flower garlands are tied around their necks. Turmeric and kumkum are also devotionally put on the foreheads of the cattle.&lt;ref name = Bhalla/&gt; The cow–keepers dressed in their regale sprinkle the cattle with saffron water with mango leaves with prayers to protect them from evil and shout the popular slogan of the festival, “Pongal! Pongal!”. This prayer is a special wish for the progressive prosperity and growth of the cattle population, with the blessings of Indra and [[Krishna]] (Gopala), who was a cowherd. Devotees pay their respect to cows by bending down, like praying in a temple, and touching their feet and foreheads, followed by an [[aarti]] (showing camphor flame to the object of praise) and offering the cattle [[prasad]] (food offering, in this case is called Sakkar Pongal – a delicacy cooked of rice, moong dal (green gram) with [[jaggery]] and dry fruits). The cattle are taken in a procession, attended by bands of music, through the village streets to a public space in the village. The resounding of their bells attracts the villagers as the young men race each other's cattle. Then the entire atmosphere becomes festive and full of fun and revelry. Big commotion is seen when the game "Jallikattu" or "Manji Virattu" starts in which groups of young men chase the running bulls.&lt;ref name=Bhalla/&gt;&lt;ref name=Verma/&gt;

==Jallikattu==
{{Main article|Jallikattu}}

[[File:Bullriding-India-PONGAL festival-Tamiword25.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Jallikattu]] – A bull riding village sport as part of Mattu Pongal celebration]]

[[Jallikattu]] (''bull embracing'') – initially – was a bull taming village sport held in the after noon or evening of the Mattu Pongal celebrations. This sport was popular in the southern part of Tamil Nadu, particularly in [[Madurai]], [[Tiruchirapalli]] and [[Tanjavur]]. On this day, the bulls, which were worshipped and fed during the day, their horns were tied with bundles of money in the form of coins or notes. The young boys chased such bulls, lassoed them and retrieved the money tied to the horn. If they failed the bulls ran away and were seen only the next morning. But this was a milder form of the sport which was seen in most villages in Tamil Nadu 500 years back.&lt;ref name=Tourist/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bhalla/&gt; This traditional sport changed during the Nayaka rule in Tamil Nadu From a harmless bull-chasing sport it got transformed into the present form of Jallikattu, which is a bloodier bull-wrestling sport that takes place now in villages throughout Tamil Nadu, to celebrate Mattu Pongal.&lt;ref name=Hindu&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2008/01/17/stories/2008011759090900.htm|title= Bull chasing, an ancient Tamil tradition|accessdate=2010-01-01|publisher=The Hindu|date=17 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jallikattu, as an ancient sport of Tamil Nadu, has been corroborated from rock paintings of 'bull chasing sport' discovered on massive rock surfaces at Karikkiyur in [[Nilgiris]] in Tamil Nadu, which are dated between 2,000 B.C. and 1,500 B.C.&lt;ref name=Hindu/&gt;

The regular bull embrace that are held now are in a well organised manner by bull owners and the youthful village men. In the present form, prizes are offered to the bull fighters and the bull owners. The bull fight is held, at a central location in the village where people assemble in large numbers to witness the fight. It is held in an enclosure with a {{convert|30|ft|m}} marker. The bulls that are specially trained for this occasion are then led from the pen to the ring to fight, one by one, when young boys of the village grab the bull by its horn or neck or tail and try to hold on to it. If the boys are thrown off or hurt seriously within the ring no prize is given to them. If they hold on or even thrown off but are not in any way injured then the prize is given to them. If the contesting young men hold on to the bull from the marker entrance of the pen then they are given prizes. If the bulls win, then the prizes go to the bull owners. It is said that in some villages as many as 600 bulls, 600 participants and 10,000 spectators participate. The fight between man and the bull is quite fierce and many times bloody. It is considered a heroic act on the part of the young men. The young participants show off their heroism by displaying the number of cuts they have suffered during such fights. This type of fight is said to be akin to the bull fights of Spain.&lt;ref name=Hindu/&gt; However, in this case, the fight is to win prizes by holding on to the bulls’ neck or horn. The bull is never killed, however many boys get killed by goring by the bull since they fight with their bare hands and with confidence of their strength. In many instances, the audiences watching the fight have also been injured by the ferocious bulls. In recent years, there have been deaths of young boys during this festival, which has created a furore among the public. In one year, there was a report of death of as many as 20 young men, apart from mauling and trampling of spectators.&lt;ref name=ring&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/03/22/travel/21webletter.html?pagewanted=1|title= Ringing in the New Year by Wrestling Bulls|accessdate=2010-01-01|publisher=New York Times|date=22 March 2007 | first=Daniel | last=Grushkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fight&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/03/22/travel/21webletter.html?pagewanted=2|title= Ringing in the New Year by Wrestling Bulls|accessdate=2010-01-01|publisher=New York Times|date=22 March 2007 | first=Daniel | last=Grushkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As result of deaths of young men, the Supreme Court was approached to stop this festival, as it was considered inhuman and dangerous. The plea made was that the Jallikattu was "backward, dangerous, a violation of animals’ rights and detrimental to India's modernizing image." The stoppage of the festival, however, resulted in protests by the villagers who wanted this sport to continue. Finally, on assurances given by the State government that enough security and safety arrangements would be provided at all such sports locations in the villages, Jallikattu has been permitted to be observed as part of the Mattu Pongal festival. As a result of court's intervention, doctors are ready at call to attend to injured young men or boys. A two tier high bamboo fencing is also erected between the bull ring and the audience who come to witness the fight in large numbers.&lt;ref name=fight/&gt;

==Similarities in other religions==
Studies on similarities in the holding of Hindu seasonal festivals, particularly in South India, which are termed pre-historic and the [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] or Pre-[[Aryan]] period with those of Christianity in Europe, indicate that such similarities may not be coincidental.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Robertson|first= John M.|title= Christianity and Mythology|work=Christ and Krishna|accessdate=2009-12-31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usGxKc9gMNwC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=Mattu+Pongal&amp;ei=K9o0S-2tMYzSkwTg9f23AQ&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Mattu%20Pongal&amp;f=false|publisher= Kessinger Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-7661-8768-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winter solstice is the date of Sun entering [[Capricornus|Capricorn]] in both the traditions that coincides with Makara Sankranti (called Uttarayana meaning the return of the luminary to the northern region), the first day of the new year starting with the month [[Magha (month)|Magha]] according to the Hindu [[Tamil calendar]]. This corresponds to 21 December per Christian date and is called the sign of the Goat, while the same happens in mid-January according to Hindu calendar. Makara Sankranti is celebrated among the Hindus for three days, with Mattu Pongal (feast of cattle) held the day after Sun entering Capricorn. (There is a slight variation in dates followed for the festival, varying from year to year, but the essence of observing Makara Sankranti is the same among Hindus). Worship of cattle by Hindus during Mattu Pongal has a striking similarity with the [[Catholic]] function held on 17 January in Rome as [[Anthony the Great|Saint Anthony]] day, when cattle (the cows, horses, goats, asses and so forth) are blessed. Wilson has allegorically given an analogy:&lt;ref name="Robertson pp.178-179"&gt;Robertson pp.178-179&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The time of the year, the decorating of the cattle, the sprinkling of them with water, and the very purport of the blessing, that they may be exempt from evils, are so decidedly Indian, that could a Dravira Brahmin be set down of a sudden in the Piazza, and when he asked what ceremony he witnessed, there can be no doubt of his answer; he would at once declare they were celebrating the Pongal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Michael Everson''' (born January 9, 1963) is an American and Irish [[linguistics|linguist]], [[Character encoding|script encoder]], [[typesetting|typesetter]], [[font designer]], and [[Publishing|publisher]]. He runs a publishing company called Evertype, through which he has published over a hundred books since 2006.

His central area of expertise is with [[writing system]]s of the world, specifically in the representation of these systems in formats for [[computer]] and digital media. In 2003 Rick McGowan said he was "probably the world's leading expert in the computer encoding of scripts"&lt;ref name=expert&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EED9143DF936A1575AC0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=For the World's ABC's, He Makes 1's and 0's|date=2003-09-25|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-05-23|last=Erard|first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his work to add a wide variety of [[Writing systems|scripts]] and [[Character (computing)|characters]] to the [[Universal Character Set]]. Since 1993, he has written over two hundred proposals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Everson|publisher=Evertype|url=http://www.evertype.com/formal.html|title= Papers formally submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2|date=2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have added thousands of characters to [[ISO/IEC 10646]] and [[The Unicode Standard]].

==Life==
{{refimprove-BLP|date=August 2018}}
Everson was born in [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]], [[Pennsylvania]], and moved to [[Tucson, Arizona]], at the age of 12. His interest in the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] led him to study [[Old English language|Old English]] and then other [[Germanic languages]]. He read [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[French language|French]] for his B.A. at the [[University of Arizona]] (1985), and the History of Religions and [[Indo-European linguistics]] for his M.A. at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (1988).

In 1989, a former professor, Dr. [[Marija Gimbutas]], asked him to read a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertype.com/misc/basque-jies/basque-jies.html|title=Tenacity in religion, myth, and folklore|publisher=Evertype.com|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Basque mythology]] at an [[Indo-European studies|Indo-Europeanist]] Conference held in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]; shortly thereafter he moved to [[Dublin]], where he studied as a [[Fulbright Scholar]] in the Faculty of [[Celtic Studies]], [[University College Dublin]] (1991).&lt;ref name="urlEvertype: About Michael Everson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertype.com/misc/bio.html|title=About Michael Everson|work=Evertype.com|accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a [[naturalization|naturalized]] Irish citizen in 2000, although he retains American citizenship. He currently lives in [[Dundee]].

==Work==
Everson is active in supporting minority-language communities, especially in the fields of [[character encoding]] [[standardization]] and [[internationalization]]. In addition to being one of the primary contributing editors of the Unicode Standard, he is also a contributing editor to [[ISO/IEC 10646]], registrar for [[ISO 15924]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/iso15924/|title=ISO 15924 Registration Authority|publisher=ISO, Unicode, Inc., &amp;amp; Evertype|year=2004|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subtag reviewer for [[BCP 47]]. He has contributed to the encoding of many scripts and [[character (computing)|characters]] in those standards, receiving the Unicode [[Bulldog Award]] in 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/conference/bulldog.html|title=The Bulldog Award|publisher=Unicode, Inc.|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his technical contributions to the development and promotion of the Unicode Standard. In 2004, Everson was appointed convenor of [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] TC46/WG3 (Conversion of Written Languages), which is responsible for [[transliteration]] standards.

On July 1, 2012, Everson was appointed to the [[Volapük Academy]] by the [[Cifal]], [[Brian Reynold Bishop|Brian R. Bishop]], for his work in [[Volapük]] publishing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://volapük.com/kadam/Dalebud_Cifala_de_2012-07-01,_Num-_1.html]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123110829/http://xn--volapk-7ya.com/kadam/Dalebud_Cifala_de_2012-07-01%2C_Num-_1.html |date=January 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encoding of scripts===
Everson has been actively involved in the encoding of many scripts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Everson|publisher=Evertype|url=http://www.evertype.com/formal.html|title=Papers formally submitted to the Unicode Technical Committee and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 (Universal Character Set)|date=2009-03-19|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 standards, including [[Avestan alphabet|Avestan]], [[Balinese alphabet|Balinese]], [[Bamum language|Bamum]], [[Bassa alphabet|Bassa Vah]], [[Batak script|Batak]], [[Braille]], [[Brāhmī script|Brāhmī]], [[Bugis|Buginese]], [[Buhid script|Buhid]], [[Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics|Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics]], [[Carian language|Carian]], [[Cham script|Cham]], [[Cherokee syllabary|Cherokee]], [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]], [[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]], [[Cypriot syllabary|Cypriot]], [[Deseret alphabet|Deseret]], [[Duployan shorthand|Duployan]], [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], [[Elbasan alphabet|Elbasan]], [[Ethiopic]], [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]], [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]], [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]], [[Hanunó'o alphabet|Hanunóo]], [[Aramaic alphabet|Imperial Aramaic]], [[Inscriptional Pahlavi]], [[Pahlavi scripts|Inscriptional Parthian]], [[Javanese script|Javanese]], [[Kayah Li script|Kayah Li]], [[Khmer alphabet|Khmer]], [[Lepcha script|Lepcha]], [[Limbu alphabet|Limbu]], [[Linear A]], [[Linear B]], [[Lycian script|Lycian]], [[Lydian script|Lydian]], [[Mandaic alphabet|Mandaic]], [[Manichaean alphabet|Manichaean]], [[Meitei Mayek]], [[Mongolian script|Mongolian]], [[Burmese script|Myanmar]], [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]], [[New Tai Lue (Unicode block)|New Tai Lue]], [[NKo (Unicode block)|N'Ko]], [[Ogham]], [[Ol Chiki script|Ol Chiki]], [[Old Hungarian alphabet|Old Hungarian]], [[Old Italic alphabet|Old Italic]], [[Old North Arabian alphabet|Old North Arabian]], [[Old Persian]], [[Old South Arabian alphabet|Old South Arabian]], [[Old Turkic script|Old Turkic]], [[Osmanya script|Osmanya]], [[Palmyrene script|Palmyrene]], [[Phaistos Disc]], [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Rejang script|Rejang]], [[Runic alphabet|Runic]], [[Samaritan script|Samaritan]], [[Saurashtra language|Saurashtra]], [[Shavian alphabet|Shavian]], [[Sinhala script|Sinhala]], [[Sundanese script|Sundanese]], [[Baybayin|Tagalog]], [[Tagbanwa alphabet|Tagbanwa]], [[Tai Le script|Tai Le]], [[Tai Tham]], [[Thaana]], [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]], [[Ugaritic script|Ugaritic]], [[Vai script|Vai]], and [[Yi script|Yi]], as well as many characters belonging to the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]], and [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] scripts.

===Font development===
In 1995 he designed the [[Unicode fonts|Unicode font]], [[Everson Mono]], a [[monospaced]] [[typeface]] with more than 4,800 characters. This font was the third Unicode-encoded font to contain a large number of characters from many character blocks, after [[Lucida Sans Unicode]] and [[Unihan font]] (both 1993). In 2007 he was commissioned by the International Association of Coptic Studies to create a standard free Unicode 5.1 font for Coptic, ''Antinoou'', using the Sahidic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evertype.com/fonts/coptic/ |title=Antinoou - A standard font for Coptic |publisher=Evertype |date= |accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conscript Unicode Registry===
Together with [[John W. Cowan|John Cowan]], he is also responsible for the [[ConScript Unicode Registry]], a project to coordinate the mapping of [[artificial script]]s into the Unicode [[Private Use Area]]. Among the scripts "encoded" in the CSUR, [[Shavian]] and [[Deseret alphabet|Deseret]] were eventually formally adopted into Unicode; two other conscripts under consideration are [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s scripts of [[Tengwar]] and [[Cirth]].

===Language and locale information===
Everson has also created locale and language information for many languages, from support for the [[Irish language]] and the other [[Celtic languages]] to the [[minority languages|minority]] [[Languages of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Everson|publisher=Evertype|url=http://www.evertype.com/standards/se/loc.html|date=1997-03-14|title=Sami locales|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, together with Trond Trosterud, he co-authored Software localization into Nynorsk Norwegian, a report commissioned by the [[Norwegian Language Council]]. In 2003 he was commissioned by the [[United Nations Development Programme]] to prepare a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Everson|author2=Roozbeh Pournader|url=http://www.evertype.com/standards/af/af-locales.pdf|title=Computer Locale Requirements for Afghanistan|date=2003-07-29|publisher=Evertype|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the computer locale requirements for the major languages of [[Afghanistan]] ([[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]], and [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]]), co-authored by Roozbeh Pournader, which was endorsed by the Ministry of Communications of the [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan Transitional Islamic Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.unescap.org/rural/doc/pai/paivol13no2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Afghans beat language obstacle to entering digital age|journal=Poverty Alleviation Initiatives|date=April–June  2003|volume=13|issue=2|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|author=Lepage, Marc|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012190755/http://www.unescap.org/rural/doc/pai/paivol13no2.pdf|archivedate=2006-10-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[UNESCO]]'s Initiative B@bel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=16541&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050313172859/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=16541&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-03-13 |title=UNESCO B@bel Initiative |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |accessdate=2011-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; funded Everson's work to encode the [[N'Ko script|N'Ko]] and [[Balinese alphabet|Balinese]] scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/admin/ev.php?URL_ID=17490&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201&amp;reload=110024633|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107040404/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/admin/ev.php?URL_ID=17490&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201&amp;reload=110024633|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-01-07|title=Development of a Unicode standard for the West African Language N'ko|work=Multilingualism in Cyberspace|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=2004-11-12|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work on a standard for Cornish===
In 2007 he co-authored a proposal for a new standard written form of [[Cornish language|Cornish]], called [[Kernowek Standard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kernowak.com/kernowak-revision-15.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214309/http://www.kernowak.com/kernowak-revision-15.pdf |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the publication of the [[Standard Written Form]] in 2008, Everson and a group of other users examined the specification and implemented a set of modifications to it, publishing a formal specification in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Nicholas. 2012. ''Desky Kernowek: A Complete Guide to Cornish''. Cathair na Mart: Evertype. {{ISBN|978-1-904808-99-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Milford Oyster Festival''', sometimes shortened to "Oysterfest," is an annual cultural [[festival]] held on the third Saturday of August throughout the city of [[Milford, Connecticut]]. As a major [[tourist attraction]], billed as the largest one-day festival in the [[New England]] region&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Patricia and Lester Brooks.

==History==
[[File:BarberJohnWarnerOysterHutsMilfordPoint.jpg|thumb|left|150px|'''''Oyster Huts on Milford Point''''' a sketch by [[John Warner Barber]] for his ''Historical Collections of Connecticut'' (1836).]]

The first Milford Oyster Festival was held on the Milford Green and Fowler Field on August 23, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Albright, John B. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/10/archives/notes-bargains-in-us-for-foreign-tourists-notes-skytrain-runs-into.html Notes: Bargains in U.S. For Foreign Tourists; Notes: Skytrain Runs Into Snag]." ''The New York Times.'' August 10, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Major founders of the oysterfest include Diano Nytko, first chairperson of the Milford Chamber of Commerce,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.milfordct.com/bushistory_54.htm Milford Chamber Through the Years, 1954-2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202093841/http://milfordct.com/bushistory_54.htm |date=2010-12-02 }} Milford Chamber of Commerce, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.documentclarity.com/skin%20cancer%20info%20program_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert N. Cooke, for whom the Bob Cooke Skin Cancer Foundation was named.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rncwalk.com/Bio_Robert.html ROBERT N. COOKE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191104/http://www.rncwalk.com/Bio_Robert.html |date=2011-07-15 }} Bob Cooke Skin Cancer Foundation, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then the oyster festival has become firmly established as an annual Milford tradition, held rain or shine.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://dailypostal.com/2010/08/21/milford-oyster-festival-2010/ Milford Oyster Festival 2010]." ''Daily Postal''. August 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=misur2010&gt;Misur, Susan. "[http://www.newhavenregister.com/articles/2010/08/22/news/milford/doc4c70a51c00ba8527828365.txt Annual Oyster Festival draws thousands in Milford] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306215457/http://www.newhavenregister.com/articles/2010/08/22/news/milford/doc4c70a51c00ba8527828365.txt |date=2012-03-06 }}." ''New Haven Register''. Sunday, August 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the oysterfest was held over two days, but that proved to be too much a burden on the organizers.&lt;ref name=guerrara2006&gt;Guerrera, Lori A. "[http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17068123&amp;BRD=1660&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=8812&amp;rfi=6 32nd Annual Milford Oyster Festival Saturday, Aug. 19, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}." ''Milford Weekly''. August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

While initially established as an [[oyster festival]], the presence of actual oysters gradually faded after some time and were absent for many years outside of the festival's name.&lt;ref name=guerrara2006/&gt; In 2005, oysters returned to the festival, provided by the East Coast Shellfish Growers Association.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ecsga.org/Pages/News/ECSGAnewsletters/NewsletterV2-06.htm Successful Milford Oyster Festival 2006]." ''ECSGA Newsletter- Volume 2:06''. November 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They have been there ever since.

Starting in 2009, Milford began requiring that the non-profit AMOF reimburse the city, which spends $30,000-50,000 to host the festival each year. As a result of this decision, AMOF could no longer allow other local non-profits to sell [[beer]] at the event, as it is a major source of income for many of the non-profits. This led Alderman Ben Blake to express concern that the festival may "lose its local flavor" as "nonprofit groups [are driven] out of the Oyster Festival food court."&lt;ref&gt;Tinley, James. "[http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2010/04/09/news/milford/bb6mioysterbeer040910.txt Oyster festival will have only 1 beer vendor]." ''New Haven Register''. Friday, April 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundraising==
Many local and regional businesses, non-profits, and governmental groups have sponsored the event, including [[NBC Universal]], [[TD Bank, N.A.|TD Bank]], and [[Whole Foods Market]].&lt;ref name=amofwebsite/&gt;

Money raised by AMOF during the festival has been donated for charitable purposes. In 2010, the major fundraiser of the festival was for [[Gulf coast]] [[fishing]] communities, whose oyster industries were struggling after being shut down by the [[BP]]{{'s}} [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;Yannetti, Terri.

Smith, a world-traveling sailor and writer, wrote, "It's kind of sad to hear that none of the oysters at the recent 'Oyster Festival' were from local waters and that most of the oyster boats are now in museums," in his book of travels ''Little Fish Big Pond'' while talking about Milford as his home town.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, John A.

==Surrounding events==
On the Friday evening before the oysterfest, there is a surrounding event called "Oyster Eve," which includes activities such as dancing, dining, and a 90-minute cruise on a {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} schooner around the [[Long Island Sound]].&lt;ref name=amofwebsite/&gt; Around 1,500 people came to downtown Milford for Oyster Eve in 2010.&lt;ref name=misur2010/&gt;

In 2010, the Daniel Street [[nightclub]] began hosting what they dubbed the "1st Annual Oyster Festival After Party" on the evening after the main events close.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eventful.com/milford/events/frank-viele-manhattan-project-1st-annual-oyster-/E0-001-031279555-4 Frank Viele &amp; the Manhattan Project - 1st Annual Oyster Festival After Party]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Formula Three Cup''' is a national [[Auto racing|motor racing]] series that takes place primarily in the [[United Kingdom]], with a small number of events in mainland Europe. It is a club racing series aimed towards amateur drivers and aspiring racers, and uses older generation [[Open wheel car|single seater]] [[Formula Three]] cars to keep costs low. The F3 Cup has three classes covering cars built between 1981 and 2011.&lt;ref name=f3intro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f3cup.co.uk/news/msvr-launches-msv-f3-cup-in-2011.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726225448/http://www.f3cup.co.uk/news/msvr-launches-msv-f3-cup-in-2011.aspx |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="f3cup.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f3cup.co.uk/news/f3-cup-to-allow-newer-chassis-in-2015.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013093337/http://www.f3cup.co.uk/news/f3-cup-to-allow-newer-chassis-in-2015.aspx |archivedate=13 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is organised by [[MotorSport Vision]], and in 2015 it was the only Formula Three series in the United Kingdom.

Teams are allowed to use [[Formula Three]] chassis built after 1980 but before 2005.&lt;ref name="f3intro"/&gt; This allows teams to enter with cheaper equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f3cup.co.uk/news/simon-davey-of-msv-f3-cup-interviewed-on-msvr-media-day.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726225533/http://www.f3cup.co.uk/news/simon-davey-of-msv-f3-cup-interviewed-on-msvr-media-day.aspx |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series uses a control tyre which all drivers must use. The tyres are supplied by [[Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Company|Avon Tyres]], whose parent company supply tyres to the [[British Formula 3 Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f3cup.co.uk/news/avon-tyres-motorsport-and-sunoco-race-fuels-announced-as-official-suppliers-for-the-msv-f3-cup.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726225548/http://www.f3cup.co.uk/news/avon-tyres-motorsport-and-sunoco-race-fuels-announced-as-official-suppliers-for-the-msv-f3-cup.aspx |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Engines will be 2 litre (2000cc) restricted engines also built between 1981 and 2005.&lt;ref name=regs2011&gt;http://www.f3cup.co.uk/media/7041/msv%20f3%20cup%20issue%20two.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the mix in ages, and therefore competitiveness of cars, the championship runs three classes.

Formula Three chassis built between 2008 and 2011 are eligible to enter the main championship from 2015.&lt;ref name="f3cup.co.uk"/&gt;

*'''Cup Class''': For cars and engines built and raced between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2007, with a maximum engine air restriction of 26.00mm diameter. From 2012, Toyota "Long Life" engines from the European Open F3 Championship are eligible with a 31mm restrictor. Opel "Long Life" engines are also permitted.
*'''Trophy Class''': For cars and engines built and raced between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1996, with a maximum engine air restriction of up to 26.00mm diameter.
*'''Masters Class''': For cars and any engines built and raced between 1 January 1981 and 31 December 1991, with a maximum engine air restriction of up to 25.00mm diameter.
* There will also be a '''Guest Class''' for any other formula three car that the organising team have given permission to join the series or single events.&lt;ref name=regs2011/&gt;

==Champions==

In 2011, F3 Cup was run as a series, not as a championship.    There was a prize for the most meritorious driver, which was deemed to be Aaron Steele.   The MSA granted F3 Cup championship status for 2012 onwards.

== Plot ==

In 2007, self-styled '[[environmentalist]]' Lucy Mirando becomes [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the Mirando Corporation, succeeding her twin sister Nancy. She announces that they have been breeding a special kind of “super [[pig]]”. The twenty-six produced specimens are sent to farmers in different locations around the world, and ten years later, one of them will be crowned the winner of a competition to breed the best pig.

In 2017, a young girl named Mija lives in [[South Korea]] with her grandfather and their super pig, Okja. They are visited by Mirando spokesperson and zoologist Dr. Johnny Wilcox, who declares Okja the best super pig and announces they will take her to [[New York City]]. Mija's grandfather presents her with a gold pig and explains to her that he saved up money to buy the solid gold item to replace Okja when she was taken away. Devastated, Mija runs away to [[Seoul]] to find Okja, where she sees her as she is being loaded onto a truck. Mija chases down the truck but it is intercepted by the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF). In the resulting chaos, Mija and Okja run away but are eventually saved by the ALF, led by Jay. Jay uses another ALF member, K, as a translator to tell Mija that they plan to put a recording device in Okja's ear and let her be re-captured by the Mirando corporation to show how they mistreat their animals. Mija tells them to return her to the mountains but K tells the group that Mija is in agreement with their plan. They abandon her, and Okja is recaptured.

To minimise the PR damage to the company, Lucy pays for Mija to come to New York to be reunited with her pig. Okja is taken to a laboratory where she is forcibly bred with another super pig and flesh is taken from her for a taste test. After the ALF sees the footage, K reveals that he lied to the rest of the group about Mija's support of the plan. Jay attacks K, and expels him from the ALF.

In New York City, Mija is forced to agree to the wishes of the Mirando corporation. Jay slips into her room and tells her that they plan to rescue Okja while on stage. A parade is put on by the Mirando Corporation. Okja, blinded and battered, does not recognize Mija and attacks. Jay tries to hurt Okja, but Mija prevents him, calming Okja down. A video of the mistreatment of Okja is screened by the ALF to the public, who quickly turn on the Mirando Corporation. Mija and the ALF attempt to escape with Okja but fail. Okja is recaptured and the ALF members are arrested, except for Mija and Jay who are rescued by K. Nancy, having returned to control the company, closes the lab, scraps all of Lucy's promotional marketing, and starts full-time operations at their slaughterhouse. 

Jay and K take Mija to find Okja at the processing plant and find her being forced up a ramp leading into a slaughterhouse. Mija finds Okja as she is about to be killed and shows the Mirando employee a photograph of herself with a baby Okja. Nancy arrives and Mija offers the golden pig in exchange for Okja's life. Nancy agrees to the deal and has Jay and K arrested. As Mija and Okja are leave a pair of superpigs manages to push their newborn through the fence, and Okja hides it within her mouth to take it away.

Back in the countryside, Mija resumes her life with her grandfather, Okja, and the new piglet.

In a [[post-credits scene]], Jay is released from prison and gets on board a bus with K and the other members of the organization. With their newest member Kim Woo-shik, a former driver for Mirando Corporation, they plan to disrupt a major meeting involving all of the Mirando shareholders.

== Development and production ==
In October 2015, it was announced that director [[Bong Joon-ho]]'s next film will feature a South Korean female lead and a cast of English-speaking supporting actors, with filming set in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trumbore|first1=Dave|title=‘Okja': Bong Joon-ho’s Monster Movie Adds Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, and Bill Nighy|url=http://collider.com/okja-jake-gyllenhaal-paul-dano-bill-nighy-kelly-macdonald/ |accessdate=October 5, 2015|work=Collider|date=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10, 2015 it was picked up by [[Netflix]] and [[Plan B Entertainment]] with a budget of $50 million, with production starting in late 2016 for release in 2017.&lt;ref name=Budget&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trumbore|first1=Dave|title=Netflix Backs Bong Joon-ho’s ‘Okja’ with $50 Million|url=http://collider.com/okja-bong-joon-ho-netflix-brad-pitt-plan-b/ |accessdate=November 10, 2015|work=Collider|date=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darius Khondji joined the film as cinematographer in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asianmoviepulse.com/2016/02/bong-joon-ho-netflix-darius-khondji-join-forces-okja/|title=Bong Joon-ho, Netflix and Darius Khondji join forces for Okja|website=Asian Movie Pulse|language=en-US|access-date=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bong sought out Welsh author Jon Ronson to help with the script. Working with a rough draft of the story, Ronson helped develop the English-speaking characters.&lt;ref&gt;Schonfeld, Zach (June 17, 2017) http://www.newsweek.com/2017/06/30/okja-jon-ronson-veganism-heroism-corporate-harm-626829.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On the film [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an [[approval rating]] of 86% based on 194 reviews, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 7.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Okja'' sees Bong Joon-ho continuing to create defiantly eclectic entertainment – and still hitting more than enough of his narrative targets in the midst of a tricky tonal juggling act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/okja/|title=Okja (2017)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=March 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 76 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/okja|title=Okja reviews |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[A.O. Scott]] wrote, "''Okja'' is a miracle of imagination and technique, and Okja insists, with abundant mischief and absolute sincerity, that she possesses a soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/movies/review-okja-bong-joon-ho.html |title=Review: In ‘Okja,’ a Girl and Her Pig Take on the Food Industrial Complex|last=Scott|first=A.

{{other uses|Popular assembly (disambiguation)}}
{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}
A '''popular assembly''' (or '''people's assembly''') is a gathering called to address issues of importance to participants.  Assemblies tend to be freely open to participation and operate by [[direct democracy]].  Some assemblies are of people from a location, some from a given workplace, industry or educational establishment others are called to address a specific issue.

The term is often used to describe gatherings that address, what participants feel are, the effects of a [[democratic deficit]] in a [[Representative democracy|representative democratic systems]].&lt;ref name="Dinerstein"/&gt;  Sometimes assemblies are created to form an alternative power structure, other times they work with other forms of [[government]].

==Examples==
* [[Curiate Assembly]]
* [[Popular Assembly of the Peoples of Oaxaca]]
* [[Councils of Good Government]]
* [[Bolivarian Circles]]
* [[European Assembly for Climate Justice]] 2010
* [[Occupy movement]] 2011
* [[15M movement]] assemblies 2011–Present

===Ecclesia in Ancient Greece===
In [[Athenian democracy]] the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]] was the assembly of all male citizens.  Citizens who did not engage politically were called ἰδιώτης (''idiōtēs''), meaning a private person, a person who is not actively interested in politics; such characters were talked about with contempt and the word eventually transformed to its modern form - idiot.

===1848 German revolutions===

===Popular assemblies during the Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)===
During the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)]] many Argentinian citizens started engaging and organising their actions through assemblies.

After closure the Chilvert printing press was occupied by workers who organised through an assembly.  Within weeks of being reopened as a [[workers cooperative]] Chilvert printed a book called [https://www.amazon.com/Asambleas-Populares-Biblioteca-Pensamiento-Nacional/dp/9507540970 ''Que son las Asembleas Populares?''] or ''What are the Popular Assemblies?'',&lt;ref name="Burbach"/&gt; a collection of articles written by renowned intellectuals [[:es:Miguel Bonasso|Miguel Bonasso]], Stella Calloni and [[Rafael Bielsa]] as well as workers and participants in the assemblies.

As with other workplaces,&lt;ref name="Burbach2"/&gt; the print factory was saved from closure by the actions of a popular assembly.  The military and police were blocked from entering the factory after the popular assembly of Pompeya called on barrio residents to protect the workplace.  Individual police officers expressed their support for the workers and the popular assembly and successfully petitioned the judge to rescind his order to seize the factory.

The assemblies movement is reported to have spiked in power rapidly and fallen from any major significance within months.  It is reported&lt;ref name="Craig"/&gt; that Grigera summing up his analysis of the asambleas states
&lt;blockquote&gt;  ‘no matter how progressive or ’advanced’ the social relationships, forms of decision-making and activities of asambleas are said to be, their small scale, lack of influence and flawed co-ordination between themselves and other movements render this movement unable to overcome very narrow limitations.’ &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5954">'''Removing article from place open to the public'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999 has this expression as the statement of offence in a specimen indictment at para. 21-137, at p. 1783&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[statutory]] offence in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

==England and Wales==
This offence is created by section 11(1) of the [[Theft Act 1968]]. Sections 11(1) to (3) of that Act read:

{{Blockquote|(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) below, where the public have access to a building in order to view the building or part of it, or a collection or part of a collection housed in it, any person who without lawful authority removes from the building or its grounds the whole or part of any article displayed or kept for display to the public in the building or that part of it or in its grounds shall be guilty of an offence.

For this purpose “collection” includes a collection got together for a temporary purpose, but references in this section to a collection do not apply to a collection made or exhibited for the purpose of effecting sales or other commercial dealings.

(2) It is immaterial for purposes of subsection (1) above, that the public’s access to a building is limited to a particular period or particular occasion; but where anything removed from a building or its grounds is there otherwise than as forming part of, or being on loan for exhibition with, a collection intended for permanent exhibition to the public, the person removing it does not thereby commit an offence under this section unless he removes it on a day when the public have access to the building as mentioned in subsection (1) above.

(3) A person does not commit an offence under this section if he believes that he has lawful authority for the removal of the thing in question or that he would have it if the person entitled to give it knew of the removal and the circumstances of it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following cases are relevant:
*R v Durkin [1973] 1 QB 786, 57 Cr App R 637, [1973] 2 All ER 872, [1973] Crim LR 372, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]]
*R v Barr [1978] Crim LR 244

'''Section 11(3)'''

Edward Griew said that section 11(3) corresponds to sections 2(1)(a) and (b) (as to which, see [[dishonesty]]).&lt;ref&gt;Griew, Edward. The Theft Acts 1968 and 1978. Sweet and Maxwell. Fifth Edition. 1986. Paragraph 5-10 at page 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visiting forces'''

This offence is an [[offence against property]] for the purposes of section 3 of the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]], section 3(6) and Schedule, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6and1Eliz2/15-16/67/schedule/paragraph/3 paragraph 3(g)] (as inserted by the [[Theft Act 1968]], Schedule 2, Part III)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mode of trial and sentence'''

This offence is triable [[either way]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], section 17(1) and Schedule 1, paragraph 28&lt;/ref&gt; A person guilty of this offence is liable, on conviction on [[indictment]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Theft Act 1968]], section 11(4)&lt;/ref&gt; or on [[summary conviction]] to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the [[prescribed sum]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]], section 32(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Ring a Ring o' Roses'''" or "'''Ring a Ring o' Rosie'''" is a [[nursery rhyme]] or [[traditional music|folksong]] and [[playground game|playground]] [[singing game]]. It first appeared in print in 1881, but it is reported that a version was already being sung to the current tune in the 1790s and similar rhymes are known from across Europe. It has a [[Roud Folk Song Index]] number of 7925. [[Urban legend]] says the song originally described the [[plague (disease)|plague]], specifically the [[Great Plague of London]], or the [[Black Death]], but [[folklorists]] reject this idea.&lt;ref name=snopes&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.snopes.com/language/literary/rosie.htm| title = Ring Around the Rosie| accessdate = 2007-01-10| last=Mikkelson| first=Barbara|author2=Mikkelson, David P. | date =2007-07-12| publisher=[[Snopes]]| work=Urban Legends Reference Pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unknown what the earliest version of the rhyme was or when it began. Many incarnations of the game have a group of children form a ring, [[circle dance|dance in a circle]] around a person, and stoop or curtsy with the final line. The slowest child to do so is faced with a penalty or becomes the "rosie" (literally: [[rose]] tree, from the French ''rosier'') and takes their place in the center of the ring. 

Variations, corruptions, and vulgarized versions were noted to be in use long before the earliest printed publications. One such variation was dated to be in use in [[Connecticut]] in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="newell"/&gt;

Common British versions include:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ring-a-ring o' roses,
A pocket full of posies,
A-tishoo! A-tishoo!
We all fall down.&lt;ref name=Delamar2001pp38-9&gt;Delamar (2001), pp. 38-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Cows in the meadows 
Eating buttercups
A-tishoo! A-tishoo!
We all jump up.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Common American versions include:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;

===Early attestation===
[[File:Ring-a-ring-a-roses.jpg|thumb|right|Kate Greenaway's illustration from ''Mother Goose or the Old Nursery Rhymes'' (1881), showing children playing the game]]

A reference to a young children's game named ''Ring o' Roses'' occurs in an 1846 article from the ''[[Brooklyn Eagle]]''. A group of young children (the eldest being about seven) form a ring, from which a boy takes out a girl and kisses her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Brooklyn Eagle |date=1846-03-17 |page=2 |title=Gleanings from the Writings of the late Wm. B. Marsh IV: Twilight Musings |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12430008/ring_o_roses_childrens_game/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early version of the rhyme occurs in a novel of 1855, ''The Old Homestead'' by [[Ann S. Stephens]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
A ring – a ring of roses,
Laps full of posies;
Awake – awake!
Now come and make
A ring – a ring of roses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ann S. |last=Stephens |title=The Old Homestead |year=1855 |publisher=Sampson, Low, Son &amp; Co. |location=London |page=213 |url=https://archive.org/stream/oldhomesteadedb00stepgoog#page/n214/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The novel goes on to describe a nineteenth-century [[Fourth of July]] celebration by children housed in a hospital in [[Roosevelt_Island|Roosevelt Island, New York]] (then known as "Blackwell's Island"):  'Then the little girls began to seek their own amusements. They played "hide and seek," "ring, ring a rosy," and a thousand wild and pretty games'.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, op. cit, [https://archive.org/stream/oldhomesteadedb00stepgoog#page/n216/mode/2up pp. 215-216]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early printing of the rhyme was in [[Kate Greenaway]]'s 1881 edition of ''Mother Goose; or, the Old Nursery Rhymes'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ring-a-ring-a-roses,
A pocket full of [[Nosegay|posies]];
Hush! hush! hush! hush!
We're all tumbled down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mother Goose, or the Old Nursery Rhymes |first=Kate (illustr.) |last=Greenaway |location=London |publisher=Frederick Warne and Co. |date=n.d. |orig-year=1881 |page=52 |url=https://archive.org/stream/mothergooseoroldgree#page/52/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1882, [[Godey's Lady's Book]] has the following version:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ring around a rosy
Pocket full of posies.
One, two, three—squat!&lt;ref name="godey"&gt;{{cite journal |date=October 1882 |work=Godey's Lady's Book and Magazine |location=Philadelphia |volume=cv |issue=628 |page=379 |title=Games |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433104870070;view=1up;seq=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before the last line, the children stop suddenly, then exclaim it together, "suiting the action to
the word with unfailing hilarity and complete satisfaction".&lt;ref name="godey"/&gt;

In his ''Games and Songs of American Children'' (1883), [[William Wells Newell]] reports several variants, one of which he provides with a melody and dates to [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]] around 1790:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ring a ring a Rosie,
A bottle full of posie,
All the girls in our town
Ring for little Josie.&lt;ref name="newell"&gt;{{cite book |first=William Wells |last=Newell |title=Games and Songs of American Children |year=1884 |orig-year=1883 |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |pages=127-8 |url=https://archive.org/stream/gamessongsofamer01newe#page/126}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Newell writes that '[a]t the end of the words the children suddenly stoop, and the last to get down undergoes some penalty, or has to take the place of the child in the centre, who represents the "rosie" (rose-tree; French, ''rosier'').'&lt;ref name="newell"/&gt;

An 1883 collection of [[Shropshire]] folk-lore includes the following version:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
A ring, a ring o' roses,
A pocket-full o' posies;
One for Jack and one for Jim and one for little Moses!
A-tisha! a-tisha! a-tisha!&lt;ref name="burne"&gt;{{cite book |first=Charlotte Sophia (ed.)|last=Burne |title=Shropshire Folk-Lore |year=1883 |location=London |publisher=Trübner &amp; Co. |pages=511-512 |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015012258318?urlappend=%3Bseq=535}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the last line "they stand and imitate sneezing".&lt;ref name="burne"/&gt;

A manuscript of rhymes collected in [[Lancashire]] at the same period gives three closely related versions, with the now familiar sneezing, for instance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
A ring, a ring o' roses,
A pocket full o' posies-
Atishoo atishoo we all fall down.&lt;ref&gt;Opie and Opie (1985), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1892, folklorist [[Alice Gomme]] could give twelve versions.&lt;ref&gt;Opie and Opie (1951), p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;

A German rhyme first printed in 1796 closely resembles "Ring a ring o'roses" in its first stanza&lt;ref&gt;The one commonly sung according to Böhme (1897), p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt; and accompanies the same actions (with sitting rather than falling as the concluding action):&lt;ref&gt;Böhme (1897), p. 438, Opie and Opie (1985), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ringel ringel reihen,
Wir sind der Kinder dreien,
sitzen unter'm Hollerbusch
Und machen alle Husch husch husch!&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Loosely translated this says "Ringed, ringed row. We are three children, sitting under an elder bush. All of us going hush, hush, hush!" The rhyme is well known in Germany with the first line "''Ringel, Ringel, Reihe''" (as the popular collection ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' gave it); it has many local variants, often with "''Husch, husch, husch''" (which in German could mean "quick, quick") in the fourth line,&lt;ref&gt;Böhme (1897), pp. 438–41, Opie and Opie (1985), p. 227. Other rhymes for the same game have some similarity in the first line, e.g. "''Ringel, ringel, Rosenkranz''", less in other lines{{spaced ndash}}see Böhme (1897), 442–5.&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to the "Hush! hush! hush! hush!" of the first printed English version. This popular variant is notable:&lt;ref&gt;"Deutsches Kinderlied und Kinderspiel. In Kassel aus Kindermund in Wort und Weise gesammelt von Johann Lewalter" (Kassel 1911), I Nr. 12. Hermann Dunger, "Kinderlieder und Kinderspiele aus dem Vogtlande" (Plauen 1874), p. 320. Böhme (1897)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ringel, Ringel, Rosen,
Schöne Aprikosen,
Veilchen blau, Vergissmeinnicht,
Alle Kinder setzen sich!&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The translation is "A ring, a ring of roses. Beautiful apricots. Blue violets, forget-me-nots. All children sit down."

Swiss versions have the children dancing round a rosebush.&lt;ref&gt;Böhme (1897), p. 439, Opie and Opie (1985), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Other European singing games with a strong resemblance include "''Roze, roze, meie''" ("Rose, rose, May") from The Netherlands with a similar tune to "Ring a ring o' roses"&lt;ref&gt;Opie and Opie (1985), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; and "''Gira, gira rosa''" ("Circle, circle, rose"), recorded in Venice in 1874, in which girls danced around the girl in the middle who skipped and curtsied as demanded by the verses and at the end kissed the one she liked best, so choosing her for the middle.&lt;ref name="theorydate"&gt;Opie and Opie (1985), p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Croatian/Serbian/Bosnian language, there is a similar rhyme called "Ringe Ringe Raja":

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ringe-ringe-raja,
Doš'o čika Paja,
Pa pojeo jaja.
Jedno jaje muć,
A mi, djeco, čuč!&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A rough translation is "Ringe Ringe Raya (doesn't mean anything, this is common in Croato-Serbian rhymes), uncle Ducky has came, and he ate all the eggs, one egg crashed, and we children squat!" On the last word, the children singing the rhyme jump or squat.

==Meaning==
[[File:RingaRosesTumbleDown.jpg|thumb|Illustration by L. Leslie Brooke (1862–1940) for "All Tumble Down" from Anon, ''Ring O' Roses'' (1922)]]
The origins and meanings of the game have long been unknown and subject to speculation. In 1898, ''A Dictionary of British Folklore'' contained the belief that an explanation of the game was of pagan origin, based on the ''Sheffield Glossary'' comparison of [[Jacob Grimm]]'s ''[[Deutsche Mythologie]]''. The theory states that it is in reference to Pagan myths and cited a passage which states, "Gifted children of fortune have the power to laugh roses, as Freyja wept gold." Believing the first instance to be indicative of Pagan beings of light. Another suggestion is more literal, that it was making a "ring" around the roses and bowing with the all "fall down" as a [[curtsy]].&lt;ref name=nutt /&gt; In 1892, the American writer, [[Eugene Field]] wrote a poem titled ''Teeny-Weeny'' that specifically referred to [[fairy|fey]] folk playing ring-a-rosie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2921540/the_osage_city_free_press/ | title=Children's Column | publisher=The Osage City Free Press (Osage City, Kansas) | date=25 August 1892 | accessdate=31 July 2015 | pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Games and Songs of American Children'', published in 1883, the "rosie" was a reference to the French word for [[Rhododendron ponticum|rose tree]] and the children would dance and stoop to the person in the center.&lt;ref name="newell"/&gt; Variations, especially more literal ones, were identified and noted with the literal falling down that would sever the connections to the game-rhyme. Again in 1898, sneezing was then noted to be indicative of many superstitious and supernatural beliefs across differing cultures.&lt;ref name=nutt&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YkwTR64_q00C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=%22ring+a+rosy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMImO3xmbqGxwIVQ5oeCh2FQgAo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ring%20a%20rosy%22&amp;f=false | title=A Dictionary of British Folklore | publisher=D. Nutt | author=Gomme, George Laurence | year=1898 | pages=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 20th century, the rhyme has often been associated with the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]] which happened in [[England]] in 1665, or with earlier outbreaks of the [[Black Death]] in England. Interpreters of the rhyme before the [[Second World War]] make no mention of this;&lt;ref name = "Opies 1985 221-2"&gt;Opie and Opie (1985), pp. 221–2.&lt;/ref&gt; by 1951, however, it seems to have become well established as an explanation for the form of the rhyme that had become standard in the United Kingdom. [[Peter and Iona Opie]], the leading authorities on [[nursery rhyme]]s, remarked:

{{quote|The invariable sneezing and falling down in modern English versions have given would-be origin finders the opportunity to say that the rhyme dates back to the Great Plague. A rosy rash, they allege, was a symptom of the plague, and [[nosegay|posies]] of herbs were carried as protection and to ward off the smell of the disease. [[Sneezing]] or [[coughing]] was a final fatal symptom, and "all fall down" was exactly what happened.&lt;ref&gt;Opie and Opie (1951), p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "symptoms"&gt;Compare Opie and Opie (1985), p. 221, where they note that neither cure nor symptoms (except for death) feature prominently in contemporary or near contemporary accounts of the plague.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The line ''Ashes, Ashes'' in colonial versions of the rhyme is claimed to refer variously to [[cremation]] of the bodies, the burning of victims' houses, or blackening of their skin, and the theory has been adapted to be applied to other versions of the rhyme.&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt; In its various forms, the interpretation has entered into popular culture and has been used elsewhere to make oblique reference to the plague.&lt;ref&gt;Opie and Opie (1985), p. 221, citing the use of the rhyme to headline an article on the plague village of [[Eyam]] in the ''Radio Times'', 7 June 1973; title of [https://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg17223184.000 "Ashes" in the ''New Scientist'' review].&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklore scholars regard the theory as baseless for several reasons:
*The plague explanation did not appear until the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref name="theorydate"/&gt;
*The symptoms described do not fit especially well with the Great Plague.&lt;ref name="symptoms"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Simpson and S. Roud, ''A Dictionary of English Folklore'' (Oxford: OUP, 2000), p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The great variety of forms makes it unlikely that the modern form is the most ancient one, and the words on which the interpretation are based are not found in many of the earliest records of the rhyme (see above).&lt;ref name=snopes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Opie and Opie (1985), pp. 222–3: "The following are the seven earliest reports known from in Britain ... In only four of these recordings is sneezing a feature". The point becomes stronger when American versions are also taken into account.&lt;/ref&gt;
*European and 19th-century versions of the rhyme suggest that this "fall" was not a literal falling down, but a [[curtsy]] or other form of bending movement that was common in other dramatic singing games.&lt;ref&gt;See above, and Opie and Opie (1951), p. 365, citing ''Chants Populaire du Languedoc'': "Branle, calandre, La Fille d'Alexandre, La pêche bien mûre, Le rosier tout fleuri, Coucou toupi{{spaced ndash}}En disant 'coucou toupi', tous les enfants quie forment la ronde, s'accroupissent", roughly translated: "The peach well ripe, the rose all blooming, cuckoo humming - When 'cuckoo humming' is said, all the children forming the circle crouch down".&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert M. Huffstutler''' was director of [[National Photographic Interpretation Center]] from February 1984 to January 1988.&lt;ref name="Leaders"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/agency/nga/leaders.pdf|title=Historical Handbook of NGA Leaders|publisher=Office of Corporate Communications|website=Federation of American Scientists}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his appointment as director of NPIC, Huffstutler was a twenty-five year veteran of [[Central Intelligence Agency]], and head of the intelligence directorate's Office of Soviet Analysis. He had served in Office of Strategic Research from 1967 to 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richelson|first=Jeffrey T|title=The Wizards Of Langley: Inside The Cia's Directorate Of Science And Technology|url={{Google books|ggs4DgAAQBAJ|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, and career==
Huffstutler received a BA in economics and an MA in international economics from the University of California at Berkeley. He also attended the Institute for Defense Analysis, University of Maryland and at the Royal College of Defense Studies, London, England. After completing his graduate degree in 1958, he joined the CIA as an international economist. Within a few months he was reassigned to work as a military force analyst in the office that was later designated the Office of Strategic Research (OSR) in the Directorate of Intelligence.&lt;ref name="Leaders" /&gt;

==Career==
In 1967, he was reassigned to the Strategic Defense Branch of OSR. From 1976 to 1978 he served as deputy director of the Office of Weapons Intelligence, and in late 1978 he became director of Strategic Research. In 1982, when the 
Directorate of Intelligence was reorganized, he became the director of Soviet Analysis.

During his tenure as director of NPIC (February 1984 to January 1988), Huffstutler transformed imagery analysis with a large technical modernization program. He established the National Exploitation Laboratory to enhance imagery exploitation, launched a product quality improvement program, and implemented a new personnel system. In early 1998 Huffstutler returned to the CIA as deputy director for Administration; four years later he was named executive director. He retired from the CIA in 1994.&lt;ref name="Leaders" /&gt;

==Accolades==
*Huffstutler was twice awarded the [[National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal]] and holds two of CIA's [[Distinguished Intelligence Medal]]s.
*In April 2003 he was inducted into the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) Hall of Fame, at which time he was cited for encouraging NPIC analysts to "push the threshold of imagery's contributions to tough intelligence issues."&lt;ref name="Leaders" /&gt;

Some states accept an SR-22 as an alternative to a deposit in cash or security as proof of financial responsibility. In Arizona, for instance, a driver seeking reinstatement under some circumstances may submit a SR-22 in lieu of depositing $40,000 in cash or [[certificate of deposit|certificates of deposit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nesci|first1=James|title=Arizona DUI Defense: The Law and Practice|date=2009|publisher=Lawyers &amp; Judges Publishing Company|location=Tucson, Arizona|isbn=978-1-933264-66-0|page=61|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''STARTS Prize''' is the grand prize of the [[European Commission]] that honors projects that demonstrate the successful integration of [[science]], [[technology]] and [[art]] to contribute to social and economic innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/launch-starts-prize-2017-honouring-successful-collaboration-between-technology-and-arts|title=Launch of STARTS prize 2017 – Honouring successful collaboration between technology and the Arts|last=|first=|date=|work=European Commission – Digital Single Market|access-date=2017-04-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two grand prize winners and up to ten honorary mentions are selected by an international jury each year. One grand prize is awarded for innovative collaboration between industry or technology and the arts that open new pathways for innovation. A second grand prize is awarded for artistic exploration and art works where appropriation by the arts has a strong potential to influence or alter the use, deployment or perception of technology. The prize is funded under [[Horizon 2020]] and is awarded on behalf of the [[European Commission]], [[Ars Electronica]] in collaboration with [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels|BOZAR]] and [[Waag Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://starts-prize.aec.at/en/about/|title=About|work=STARTS PRIZE|access-date=2017-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shea Seating.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.15|Seating arrangement in Shea Stadium]]
In live entertainment, there are several possible schemes for the '''seating assignment''' of spectators. There are several schemes which are most commonly used, though there are no hard and fast rules and alternate or modified schemes are sometimes used as is suitable to the event.

==Reserved seating==
In a purely '''reserved seating''' (also known as '''allocated seating''' or '''assigned seating''') scheme, each [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]] is assigned a specific [[seat]] in the venue at the time of purchase. Seats are typically identified by row number/letter, seat number, and sometimes by section.

Reserved seating is the most common scheme used for large indoor venues such as [[stadium|stadia]], [[arena]]s, and larger [[theatre]]s. It is also common at other venues, as are other seating schemes, such as outdoor [[amphitheatre]]s.

==General admission==
In a '''general admission''' (also known as '''open seating''' or '''free seating''') scheme, each spectator has a ticket. However, the location from which they will watch the event is determined upon arrival at the venue. General admission is most commonly employed in seat-less venues, such as outdoor festival shows and smaller club shows. It is also sometimes used in seat-less sections of events that would otherwise have reserved seating ([[standing-room only]] sections, including the floor section(s) at some [[concert]]s). In some general admission events, a ticket may still assign the holder a specific section of the venue (e.g., balcony or floor), with the choice of seat within that section.

General admission can also refer to a scheme in which seating is available; however, it is not pre-assigned. Typically in this scheme, seat selection is on a [[first-come, first-served]] basis. A common example of this scheme is most [[movie theatre]]s in the United States.

General admission events may be ticketed with no assigned seat number, or it may be purely first-come, first-served, in which the first certain number of people in line are admitted (either as a free event, or paying at the door/gate). Due to the first-come, first-served nature of the seating selection, line-ups may still form for pre-ticketed events.

===Festival seating===
'''Festival seating''' typically refers to the form of general admission (first-come, first-served) in which there is a large open area (generally outdoors) and all spectators must stand (unless they are permitted to bring their own portable seating). Many music acts use festival seating because it allows the most enthusiastic fans to get near the stage and generate excitement for the rest of the crowd. Some performers and bands insist on a festival seating area near the stage.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

On December 3, 1979, the [[Riverfront Coliseum]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], was the site of one of the worst rock concert tragedies in [[United States]] history. [[The Who concert disaster|Eleven fans were killed and several dozen others injured]] in the rush for seating at the opening of a sold-out concert by [[The Who]]. The concert was using festival seating. When the crowds waiting outside heard the band performing a [[soundcheck]], they thought the concert was beginning and rammed the still-closed doors, trampling those at the front of the crowd.

The tragedy was blamed on poor [[crowd control]], mainly the failure of arena management to open enough doors to deal with the crowd outside. As a result, concert venues across [[North America]] switched to assigned seating or changed their rules about festival seating. Cincinnati immediately outlawed festival seating at concerts, although it overturned the ban on August 4, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kemme |first=Steve |date=August 5, 2004 |title=Festival seating unanimously OK'd |url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/08/05/loc_council05.1.html |newspaper=The Cincinnati Enquirer |access-date=March 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the ban was making it difficult for Cincinnati to book concerts. (In 2002, the city had made a one-time exception to the ban, allowing festival seating for a [[Bruce Springsteen]] concert; no problems were experienced.) Cincinnati was the only city in the U.S. to outlaw festival seating altogether.

===Lawn seating===
"Lawn seating" refers to a seating method where concert-goers sit on the grass in the rear of the venue. Attendees can sometimes bring their own [[chair]]s, or rent them from vendors at the concert.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6679">'''Terence D. Tolbert''' (1964 – November 2, 2008) was an [[United States|American]] [[political operative]] who was the [[Nevada]] state director for [[Barack Obama]]'s 2008 presidential campaign and an aide to [[Joel Klein]], the [[New York City School Chancellor]]. Tolbert's death came two days before the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]],&lt;ref name=KCStar/&gt; and the same day as [[Madelyn Dunham|Obama's grandmother]].

==Biography==
Tolbert was born and raised in [[Harlem]]. He graduated from the [[Bronx High School of Science]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://alumni.bxscience.edu/?page=Memoriam In Memoriam page for The Bronx High School of Science Alumni Association website].  Accessed July 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; where he was a classmate of [[Christopher "Kid" Reid]], the rap musician and actor, and [[John T. Georgopoulos]], a [[fantasy sports]] writer.  He later earned a bachelor's degree from [[Hunter College]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;  He had lived in Harlem with his wife, Freida Foster-Tolbert.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

Tolbert started his career in politics when he worked at the [[New York State Senate]] Minority Program Office in Albany. He also served on the staff of State Senators [[Martin Connor]] and [[Joseph L. Galiber]], and for [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Charles B. Rangel]].&lt;ref name=KCStar/&gt;

He was the chief of staff to [[New York State Assembly]]man [[Keith L. T. Wright]] for eight years. In 2003 and 2004, Tolbert was the New York state director for the presidential campaign of [[John Edwards]]. Tolbert had taken a leave from his position as chief of staff to Assemblyman Wright, who was in turn supporting [[John Kerry]]'s presidential bid.&lt;ref&gt;Slackman, Michael. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01EEDA1E3CF93BA15751C0A9629C8B63 "Primary Race Comes to New York, but Focus Doesn't"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 28, 2004. Accessed November 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the Edwards campaign in 2004, Tolbert was the Nevada state director of [[America Coming Together]], a [[527 group]] dedicated to [[get out the vote]] efforts, primarily for Democratic candidates. Tolbert served as the liaison to ethnic, religious and cultural groups in the city for [[Mayor of New York City]] [[Michael Bloomberg]] in his bid for a second term in the [[New York City mayoral election, 2005|2005 mayoral election]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; He had also worked on the campaigns of [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Chuck Schumer]] and former [[Governor of New York]] [[Eliot Spitzer]].&lt;ref name=KCStar/&gt;

Tolbert was hired by the [[New York City Department of Education]] in 2006, serving as its primary representative in [[Albany, New York]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] lobbying on behalf of Bloomberg's efforts to extend the law due to expire in June 2009 that grants the mayor primary authority over the New York City public schools.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

He took a leave of absence from the Department of Education in July to work in Nevada as state director for the Obama campaign,&lt;ref name="Top official dead"&gt;Elizabeth Green, "Top education dept official, Terence Tolbert, dies of heart attack," ''Gohtam Schools, November 3, 2008.

==Legacy==
In a press release, Mayor Bloomberg described Tolbert as one of the most likeable and hardworking people in the world and "a valued member of our administration" who "had become a personal friend". Schools Chancellor Klein eulogized Tolbert as someone "who believed deeply that government can and must play a constructive role in improving the lives of its citizens" in his role as Executive Director of Inter-Governmental Relations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home2.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&amp;catID=1194&amp;doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fhome2.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2008b%2Fpr432-08.html&amp;cc=unused1978&amp;rc=1194&amp;ndi=1 "STATEMENTS BY MAYOR MICHAEL R.

Tolbert's funeral was held at the [[Cathedral of St. John the Divine]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Tolbert's middle school in [[Harlem]] was named after him in November 2008, as a [[memorial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gothamschools.org/2008/11/10/terence-tolberts-harlem-middle-school-now-named-after-him/ Gotham Schools website].  Accessed December 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wonderfest''' is a nonprofit California corporation dedicated to informal science education. Wonderfest inspires and nurtures a deep sense of wonder about the world. Through provocative public discourse about science, Wonderfest stimulates curiosity, promotes careful reasoning, challenges unexamined beliefs, and encourages lifelong learning. Wonderfest achieves these ends primarily through regular public science gatherings in the San Francisco Bay Area and through online science videos. To date, more than 25,000 people have attended Wonderfest events, and more than 1 million have watched Wonderfest videos.

Wonderfest achieved corporate independence in September 2011.  During the preceding fourteen years, Wonderfest was an educational project of, first, [[San Francisco University High School]], then, [[The Branson School]].  From 1998 to 2010, Wonderfest produced an annual science festival—the first such community-wide event in the United States—that presented a series of expert dialogues on topics of scientific controversy.  The topics were varied, covering [[astronomy]], [[biology]], [[psychology]], [[physics]], etc.  In 2011, this festival was supplanted by the [[Bay Area Science Festival]], headquartered at the [[University of California, San Francisco]].

Wonderfest, subtitled "The Bay Area Beacon of Science," is dedicated to the memory of [[Carl Sagan]].  From 2002 through 2010, and again in 2015, Wonderfest awarded the $5000 [[Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wonderfest.org/sagan-prize/sagan-prize-recipients/ |title=Sagan Prize Recipients |work=wonderfest.org |year=2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wonderfest's founding director is Tucker Hiatt, physics teacher and former Stanford Visiting Scholar. Wonderfest's board of directors now guides its development:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wonderfest.org/directors/ |title=Directors |work=wonderfest.org |year=2011 |accessdate=September 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''world view'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/world-view|title=world-view noun - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes - Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''worldview''' is the fundamental [[cognitive]] orientation of an individual or society encompassing the whole of the individual's or society's knowledge and [[Perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]. A world view can include natural philosophy; fundamental, existential, and normative postulates; or themes, values, emotions, and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary B. |last=Palmer |title=Toward A Theory of Cultural Linguistics |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1996 |page=114 |isbn=978-0-292-76569-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a [[calque]] of the German word '''''[[wikt:Weltanschauung|Weltanschauung]]''''' {{IPA-de|ˈvɛltʔanˌʃaʊ.ʊŋ||De-Weltanschauung.ogg}}, composed of ''[[wikt:Welt|Welt]]'' ('world') and ''[[wikt:Anschauung|Anschauung]]'' ('view' or 'outlook').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=worldview |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German word is also used in English.

It is a concept fundamental to [[German philosophy]] and [[epistemology]] and refers to a ''wide world perception''. Additionally, it refers to the framework of ideas and beliefs forming a global description through which an individual, group or culture watches and interprets the [[world (philosophy)|world]] and interacts with it.

Worldview remains a confused and confusing concept in English, used very differently by [[linguistics|linguists]] and [[sociology|sociologists]]. It is for this reason that James W. Underhill suggests five subcategories: world-perceiving, world-conceiving, cultural mindset, personal world, and perspective&lt;ref name =Underhill_2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Humboldt, Worldview and Language|date=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-0748638420|edition=Transferred to digital print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Creating worldviews : metaphor, ideology and language|date=2011|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-0748679096}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate &amp; war|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1107532847}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Worldviews are often taken to operate at a conscious level, directly accessible to  articulation and discussion, as opposed to existing at a deeper, pre-conscious level, such as the idea of "[[figure and ground (media)|ground]]" in [[Gestalt psychology]] and [[Media (communication)|media analysis]]. However, core worldview beliefs are often deeply rooted, and so are only rarely reflected on by individuals, and are brought to the surface only in moments of crises of faith.

==Origins==

===Linguistics===
The [[Prussia]]n [[philology|philologist]] [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767–1835) originated the idea that language and worldview are inextricable. Humboldt saw language as part of the creative adventure of mankind. Culture, language and linguistic communities developed simultaneously and could not do so without one another. In stark contrast to [[linguistic determinism]], which invites us to consider language as a constraint, a framework or a prison house, Humboldt maintained that speech is inherently and implicitly creative. Human beings take their place in speech and continue to modify language and thought by their creative exchanges. 

[[Edward Sapir]] (1884–1939) also gives an account of the relationship between thinking and speaking in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fadul |first= Jose |date= 2014 |title= Encyclopedia of Theory and Practice in Psychotherapy and Counseling |url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WRrzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA347&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;dq=Edward+Sapir+also+gives+an+account+of+the+relationship+between+thinking+and+speaking+in+English&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ObjouuV9rd&amp;sig=RdD1S6ILO_XYWERUl0fB48KL5xk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwictcjAoJTRAhVIpI8KHbCdDk4Q6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Edward%20Sapir%20also%20gives%20an%20account%20of%20the%20relationship%20between%20thinking%20and%20speaking%20in%20English&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page= 347 |isbn= 978-1-312-34920-9 |author-link= | quote = Edward Sapir also gives an account of the significant relationship between thinking and speaking in English.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[linguistic relativity]] [[hypothesis]] of [[Benjamin Whorf|Benjamin Lee Whorf]] (1897–1941) describes how the syntactic-semantic structure of a language becomes an underlying structure for the world view or ''Weltanschauung'' of a people through the organization of the causal [[perception]] of the world and the linguistic [[categorization]] of entities. As linguistic categorization emerges as a representation of worldview and causality, it further modifies social perception and thereby leads to a continual interaction between [[language]] and perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 679389 |pages= 65–79 |last1= Kay |first1= P. |last2= Kempton |first2= W. |title= What is the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis? |volume= 86 |issue= 1 |journal= American Anthropologist |year= 1984 |doi= 10.1525/aa.1984.86.1.02a00050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whorf's hypothesis became influential in the late 1940s, but declined in prominence after a decade. In the 1990s, new research gave further support for the linguistic relativity theory in the works of [[Stephen Levinson]] (1947–) and his team at the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft|Max Planck institute]] for [[psycholinguistics]] at [[Nijmegen]], Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The theory has also gained attention through the work of [[Lera Boroditsky]] at Stanford University.

One of the most important concepts in cognitive [[philosophy]] and [[cognitive sciences]] is the German concept of ''Weltanschauung''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} This expression has often been used to refer to the "wide worldview" or "wide world perception" of a people, family, or person.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The ''Weltanschauung'' of a people originates from the unique world experience of a people, which they experience over several millennia.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}The [[language]] of a people reflects the ''Weltanschauung'' of that people in the form of its [[Syntax|syntactic structures]] and untranslatable [[connotation]]s and its [[denotation]]s.

The term ''Weltanschauung'' is often wrongly attributed to Wilhelm von Humboldt, the founder of German ethnolinguistics. However, as Jürgen Trabant points out, and as James W. Underhill reminds us, Humboldt's key concept was ''Weltansicht''.&lt;ref name=Underhill_2009/&gt; ''Weltansicht'' was used by Humboldt to refer to the overarching conceptual and sensorial apprehension of reality shared by a linguistic community (Nation). On the other hand, ''Weltanschauung'', first used by Kant and later popularized by Hegel, was always used in German and later in English to refer more to philosophies, ideologies and cultural or religious perspectives, than to linguistic communities and their mode of apprehending reality.

A worldview can be expressed as the "fundamental cognitive, affective, and evaluative presuppositions a group of people make about the nature of things, and which they use to order their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, Paul G. Transforming Worldviews: an anthropological understanding of how people change. Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Academic, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

If it were possible to draw a [[map]] of the [[world]] on the basis of ''Weltanschauung'',&lt;ref name="Whorf" &gt;{{cite book|author-last=Whorf|author-first=Benjamin Lee|author-link=Benjamin Lee Whorf|editor-last=Carroll|editor-first=John Bissell|editor-link=John Bissell Carroll|origyear=1st pub. 1956 |year=1964|title=Language, Thought, and Reality.

If the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is correct, the worldview map of the world would be similar to the linguistic map of the world. However, it would also almost coincide with a map of the world drawn on the basis of [[music]] across people.&lt;ref name="Whorf" /&gt;

===Folk-epics===
{{See also|List of world folk-epics}}

As natural language becomes manifestations of world [[perception]], the [[literature]] of a people with common ''Weltanschauung'' emerges as holistic [[representation (psychology)|representations]] of the wide world perception of the people. Thus the extent and commonality between world folk-epics becomes a manifestation of the commonality and extent of a worldview.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Epic poems]] are shared often by people across political borders and across generations. Examples of such epics include the [[Nibelungenlied]] of the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] people, the [[Iliad]] for the Ancient Greeks and Hellenized societies, the [[Silappadhikaram]] of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] people, the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] of the Hindus, the [[Gilgamesh]] of the [[Mesopotamia]]n-[[Sumer]]ian [[civilization]] and the people of the [[Fertile Crescent]] at large, [[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]] (Arabian nights) of the [[Arab world]] and the [[Epic of Sundiata|Sundiata]] epic of the [[Mandé]] people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Terror management theory===
{{Main article|Terror management theory}}
A worldview, according to [[terror management theory]] (TMT), serves as a buffer against death anxiety.&lt;ref name="worm"&gt;Schimel, J., Hayes, J., Williams, T., &amp; Jahrig, J. (2007). ''Is Death Really the Worm at the Core? Converging Evidence that Worldview Threat Increases Death-Thought Accessibility''. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 92, No. 5'', pp. 789-803.&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorised that living up to the ideals of one's worldview provides a sense of self-esteem which provides a sense of transcending the limits of human life (e.g. literally, as in religious belief in immortality, symbolically, as in art works or children to live on after one's death, or in contributions to one's culture).&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Evidence in support of terror management theory includes a series of experiments by Jeff Schimel and colleagues in which a group of Canadians found to score highly on a measure of patriotism were asked to read an essay attacking the dominant Canadian worldview.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

Using a test of [[Terror management theory#Death thought accessibility|death-thought accessibility]] (DTA), involving an ambiguous word completion test (e.g. "COFF__" could either be completed as either "COFFEE" or "COFFIN" or "COFFER"), participants who had read the essay attacking their worldview were found to have a significantly higher level of DTA than the control group, who read a similar essay attacking Australian cultural values. Mood was also measured following the worldview threat, to test whether the increase in death thoughts following worldview threat were due to other causes, for example, anger at the attack on one's cultural worldview.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; No significant changes on mood scales were found immediately following the worldview threat.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

To test the generalisability of these findings to groups and worldviews other than those of nationalistic Canadians, Schimel ''et al'' conducted a similar experiment on a group of religious individuals whose worldview included that of [[creationism]].&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Participants were asked to read an essay which argued in support of the theory of evolution, following which the same measure of DTA was taken as for the Canadian group.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Religious participants with a creationist worldview were found to have a significantly higher level of death-thought accessibility than those of the control group.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

Goldenberg ''et al'' found that highlighting the similarities between humans and other animals increases death-thought accessibility, as does attention to the physical rather than meaningful qualities of sex.&lt;ref&gt;Goldenberg, J. L., Cox, C. R., Pyszczynski, T., Greenberg, J., &amp; Solomon, S. (2002). ''Understanding human ambivalence about sex: The effects of stripping sex of meaning.'' Journal of Sex Research, 39, 310–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The term World View denotes a comprehensive set of opinions, seen as an [[organic unity]], about the world as the medium and exercise of human existence. World View serves as a framework for generating various dimensions of human perception and experience like [[knowledge]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[religion]], [[culture]], [[science]] and [[ethics]]. For example, worldview of [[causality]] as ''uni-directional'', ''cyclic'', or ''spiral'' generates a framework of the world that reflects these systems of causality.

===Causality===
An unidirectional view of [[causality]] is present in some monotheistic views of the world with a beginning and an end and a single great force with a single end (e.g., [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]), while a cyclic worldview of causality is present in religious traditions which are cyclic and seasonal and wherein events and experiences recur in systematic patterns (e.g., [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Mithraism]] and [[Hinduism]]). These worldviews of causality not only underlie religious traditions but also other aspects of thought like the purpose of [[history]], [[politics|political]] and [[economics|economic]] theories, and systems like [[democracy]], [[authoritarianism]], [[anarchism]], [[capitalism]], [[socialism]] and [[communism]].

The worldview of a [[linear]] and [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]] causality generates various related/conflicting disciplines and approaches in [[scientific thinking]]. The ''Weltanschauung'' of the temporal contiguity of act and event leads to underlying diversifications like ''determinism'' vs. ''free will''. A worldview of [[free will]] leads to disciplines that are governed by simple laws that remain constant and are static and [[empirical]] in scientific method, while a worldview of [[determinism]] generates disciplines that are governed with [[dynamical systems|generative systems]] and [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] in [[scientific method]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Some forms of [[philosophical naturalism]] and [[materialism]] reject the validity of entities inaccessible to [[natural science]]. They view the [[scientific method]] as the most reliable model for [[model (abstract)|building]] an [[understanding]] of the [[world]].

==Religion==
[[Nishida Kitaro]] wrote extensively on "the Religious Worldview" in exploring the philosophical significance of Eastern religions.&lt;ref&gt;Indeed Kitaro's final book is ''Last Writings: Nothingness and the Religious Worldview''
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Neo-Calvinist]] [[David Naugle]]'s ''World view: The History of a Concept'', "Conceiving of Christianity as a worldview has been one of the most significant developments in the recent history of the church."&lt;ref&gt;David K. Naugle ''Worldview: The History of a Concept'' {{ISBN|0-8028-4761-7}} page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian thinker [[James W. Sire]] defines a worldview as "a commitment, a fundamental orientation of the heart, that can be expressed as a story or in a set of presuppositions (assumptions which may be true, partially true, or entirely false) which we hold (consciously or subconsciously, consistently or inconsistently) about the basic construction of reality, and that provides the foundation on which we live and move and have our being." He suggests that "we should all think in terms of worldviews, that is, with a consciousness not only of our own way of thought but also that of other people, so that we can first understand and then genuinely communicate with others in our pluralistic society."&lt;ref&gt;James W. Sire ''The Universe Next Door: A Basic World view Catalog'' p15–16 (text readable at Amazon.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

The commitment mentioned by James W. Sire can be extended further. The worldview increases the commitment to serve the world. With the change of a person's view towards the world, he/she can be motivated to serve the world. This serving attitude has been illustrated by Tareq M Zayed as the 'Emancipatory Worldview' in his writing "History of emancipatory worldview of Muslim learners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/9631989/History_of_emancipatory_worldview_of_Muslim_learners|title=History of emancipatory worldview of Muslim learners|first=Tareq M|last=Zayed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question mentioned above - on whether the super-smart machines, that is, any ''[[Superintelligence|superintelligences]]'', as expected by some, could have worldviews - is interesting in this context and this would influence human worldviews. 

==Philosophy==
{{Main article|Belief system}}

The philosophical importance of worldviews became increasingly clear during the 20th century for a number of reasons, such as increasing contact between cultures, and the failure of some aspects of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] project, such as the [[rationalist]] project of attaining all truth by reason alone. [[Mathematical logic]] showed that fundamental choices of [[axioms]] were essential in deductive reasoning&lt;ref&gt;Not just in the obvious sense that you need axioms to prove anything, but the fact that for example the [[Axiom of choice]] and [[Axiom S5]], although widely regarded as correct, were in some sense optional.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, even having chosen axioms not everything that was true in a given [[logical system]] could be proven.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Godel's incompleteness theorem]] and discussion in e.g. [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]]'s ''The Freedom of the Will''&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers believe the problems extend to "the inconsistencies and failures which plagued the Enlightenment attempt to identify universal moral and rational principles";&lt;ref&gt;Thus [[Alister McGrath]] in ''[[The Science of God]]'' p 109 citing in particular [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]'s ''Whose Justice? Which Rationality?'' – he also cites [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]]&lt;/ref&gt; although Enlightenment principles such as [[universal suffrage]] and the [[universal declaration of human rights]] are accepted, if not taken for granted, by many.&lt;ref&gt;"Governments in a democracy do not grant the fundamental freedoms enumerated by Jefferson; governments are created to protect those freedoms that every individual possesses by virtue of his or her existence. In their formulation by the Enlightenment philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries, inalienable rights are God-given natural rights. These rights are not destroyed when civil society is created, and neither society nor government can remove or "alienate" them."[http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm3.htm US Gov website on democracy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201190718/http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm3.htm |date=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[theory of relativity]] offers a Weltanschauung that is revolting to [[absolute space and time]], yet provides a context for modern theories of [[electromagnetism]] and [[gravity]]. In a book review for a new undergraduate textbook on relativity by [[Wolfgang Rindler]], Kenneth Jacobs&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Jacobs (1970) "Bridging the gap between relativity and the undergraduate", [[Physics Today]] 23(12):48,8 {{doi|10.1063/1.3021868}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that "during the post-[[Sputnik]] era, [[special relativity]] began to take its rightful place in the undergraduate curriculum". On the adoption of the Weltanschauung, he notes, "The historical impact of any world picture is ... partly attributable to the zeal of the promulgators and to the efficacy of their teachings."

Philosophers also distinguish the manifest image from the scientific image. These phrases are due to the American 20th century philosopher [[Wilfrid Sellars]]. This is one angle on the ancient philosophical distinction between appearance and reality which is particularly pertinent to everyday contemporary living. Indeed, many{{Who|date=January 2017}} believe that the scientific image, with its reductionist methodology, will undermine our sense of individual freedom and responsibility. So, many{{Who|date=January 2017}} worry that as science advances, particularly cognitive neuroscience, we will be dehumanized. This certainly has powerful Nietzschean undertones. When our immediately given, manifest ([[sc.]] obvious) self-conception is shaken, what is lost for the individual and society? And does it have to be that way?&lt;ref&gt;see Owen Flanagan's 'The Problem of the Soul', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Some questions well worth working on, then, are those concerning the refinement of the manifest view of such centrally important concepts such as free will,&lt;ref&gt;see especially Daniel Dennett's 'Freedom Evolves', 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the self and individuality, and the possibility of real or lived meaning.

== Characteristics ==
While [[Leo Apostel]] and his followers clearly hold that individuals can construct worldviews, other writers regard worldviews as operating at a [[community]] level, or in an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] way. For instance, if one's worldview is fixed by one's language, as according to a strong version of the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], one would have to learn or invent a new language in order to construct a new worldview.

According to Apostel,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diederik Aerts]], [[Leo Apostel]], Bart de Moor, Staf Hellemans, Edel Maex, Hubert van Belle &amp; Jan van der Veken (1994) "[http://www.vub.ac.be/CLEA/pub/books/worldviews.pdf "World views. From Fragmentation to Integration]" VUB Press. Translation of (Apostel and Van der Veken 1991) with some additions. – The basic book of World Views, from the Center Leo Apostel.&lt;/ref&gt; a worldview is an [[ontology]], or a descriptive [[Mental model|model]] of the world. It should comprise these six elements:
# An [[explanation]] of the world
# A [[futurology]], answering the question "Where are we heading?"
# Values, answers to [[ethical]] questions: "What should we do?"
# A [[praxeology]], or [[methodology]], or theory of [[Action (philosophy)|action]]: "How should we attain our goals?"
# An [[epistemology]], or theory of [[knowledge]]: "What is [[truth|true]] and false?"
# An [[etiology]]. A constructed world-view should contain an account of its own "building blocks", its origins and construction.

== Classification of cultural worldviews ==
From across the world across all of the cultures, Roland Muller has suggested that cultural world views can be broken down into three separate world views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| title = Honor and Shame
| last = Muller
| first = Roland
| publisher = Xlibris; 1st edition
| year = 2001

| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not simple enough to say that each person is one of these three cultures. Instead, each individual is a mix of the three. For example, a person may be raised in a Power–Fear society, in an Honor–Shame family, and go to school under a Guilt–Innocence system.

=== Guilt–Innocence ===
In a Guilt–Innocence focused culture, schools focus on deductive reasoning, cause and effect, good questions, and process. Issues are often seen as black and white. Written contracts are paramount. Communication is direct, and can be blunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Three Colors of Worldview
| website = KnowledgeWorkx
| access-date = 2016-02-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honor–Shame ===
Societies with a predominantly Honor–Shame worldview teach children to make honorable choices according to the situations they find themselves in. Communication, interpersonal interaction, and business dealings are very relationship-driven, with every interaction having an effect on the Honor–Shame status of the participants. In an Honor–Shame society the crucial objective is to avoid shame and to be viewed honorably by other people. The Honor–Shame paradigm is especially strong in most regions of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| location = 
| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power–Fear ===
Some cultures can be seen very clearly in operating under a Power–Fear worldview. In these cultures it is very important to assess the people around you and know where they fall in line according to their level of power. This can be used for good or for bad. A benevolent king rules with power and his citizens fully support him wielding that power. On the converse, a ruthless dictator can use his power to create a [[culture of fear]] where his citizens are oppressed.

==Streams in contemporary American thought==

According to [[Michael Lind]], "a worldview is a more or less coherent understanding of the nature of reality, which permits its holders to interpret new information in light of their preconceptions. Clashes among worldviews cannot be ended by a simple appeal to facts. Even if rival sides agree on the facts, people may disagree on conclusions because of their different premises." This is why politicians often seem to talk past one another, or ascribe different meanings to the same events. Tribal or national wars are often the result of incompatible worldviews. Lind has organized American political worldviews into five categories:
* [[Green politics|Green]] [[Malthusianism]] synthesizes mystical versions of [[environmentalism]] with alarm about population growth in the tradition of the Rev. Thomas Malthus
* [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] [[Isolationism]] would abandon foreign alliances, dismantle most of its military, and return to a 19th-century pattern of decentralized government and an economy based on small businesses and small farms.
* [[Neoliberal]] [[Globalism]] believes that at home governments should provide only basic public goods like infrastructure and security, and do so by market-friendly methods
* [[populism|Populist]] [[Nationalism]] tends to favor restriction of legal as well as illegal [[immigration]] to protect the core stock of the tribe-state from dilution by different races, ethnic groups or religions. Populist nationalism also tends to favor [[protectionist]] policies that shield workers and businesses, particularly small businesses, from foreign competition.
* [[Social democracy|Social Democracy]] claims an economic safety net, protecting citizens from unemployment, sickness, poverty in old age and other disasters, is necessary if democratic government is to retain popular support.
Lind argues that even though not all people will fit neatly into only one category or the other, their core worldview shape how they frame their arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lind |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Lind |title=The five worldviews that define American politics |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/01/12/lind_five_worldviews/ |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon Magazine]] |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment and comparison==
One can think of a worldview as comprising a number of [[basic belief]]s which are philosophically equivalent to the axioms of the worldview considered as a logical theory. These basic beliefs cannot, by definition, be proven (in the logical sense) within the worldview precisely because they are [[axiom]]s, and are typically argued ''from'' rather than argued ''for''.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Daniel Hill and Randal Rauser ''Christian Philosophy A–Z'' [[Edinburgh University Press]] (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-7486-2152-1}} p200&lt;/ref&gt; However their coherence can be explored philosophically and logically.

If two different worldviews have sufficient common beliefs it may be possible to have a constructive dialogue between them.&lt;ref&gt;In the Christian tradition this goes back at least to [[Justin Martyr]]'s ''Dialogues with Trypho, A Jew'', and has roots in the debates recorded in the [[New Testament]] For a discussion of the long history of religious dialogue in India, see [[Amartya Sen]]'s ''The Argumentative Indian''
&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, if different worldviews are held to be basically incommensurate and irreconcilable, then the situation is one of [[cultural relativism]] and would therefore incur the standard criticisms from [[philosophical realist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/cog-rel.htm#H5 ''Cognitive Relativism'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The problem of self-refutation is quite general. It arises whether truth is relativized to a framework of concepts, of beliefs, of standards, of practices.[http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/relativism/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friesian.com/relative.htm The Friesian School on Relativism]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, religious believers might not wish to see their beliefs relativized into something that is only "true for them".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=49207 Pope Benedict warns against relativism]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/RATZRELA.HTM Ratzinger, J. ''Relativism, the Central Problem for Faith Today'']
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Subjective logic]] is a belief-reasoning formalism where beliefs explicitly are subjectively held by individuals but where a consensus between different worldviews can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2001|journal=International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems|volume=9|issue=3|pages=279–311|doi=10.1142/S0218488501000831|last1=Jøsang|first1=Audun|title=A Logic For Uncertain Probabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third alternative sees the worldview approach as only a methodological relativism, as a suspension judgment about the truth of various belief systems but not a declaration that there is no global truth. For instance, the religious philosopher [[Ninian Smart]] begins his ''Worldviews: Cross-cultural Explorations of Human Beliefs'' with "Exploring Religions and Analysing Worldviews" and argues for "the neutral, dispassionate study of different religious and secular systems—a process I call worldview analysis."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ninian Smart]] ''Worldviews: Crosscultural Explorations of Human Beliefs (3rd Edition)'' {{ISBN|0-13-020980-5}} p14
&lt;/ref&gt;

The comparison of religious, philosophical or scientific worldviews is a delicate endeavor, because such worldviews start from different [[presupposition]]s and cognitive values. Clément Vidal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Metaphilosophical Criteria for Worldview Comparison|url=http://homepages.vub.ac.be/%7Eclvidal/writings/Vidal-Metaphilosophical-Criteria.pdf|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=43|issue=3|pages=306–347|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.2012.01749.x|author=Vidal, Clément}}
&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed metaphilosophical criteria for the comparison of worldviews, classifying them in three broad categories:

# ''objective'': objective consistency, scientificity, scope
# ''subjective'': subjective consistency, personal utility, emotionality
# ''intersubjective'': intersubjective consistency, collective utility, narrativity

David Bell&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/962016344|title=SUPERINTELLIGENCE AND WORLD VIEWS.|last=BELL|first=DAVID|date=2016|publisher=GROSVENOR House PUBLISHING|isbn=9781786237668|location=Guildford, Surrey, UK|oclc=962016344}}&lt;/ref&gt; has raised interesting questions on worldviews for the designers of [[Superintelligence|superintelligences]] – machines much smarter than humans. &amp;nbsp;'Would they need worldviews, where would they get their worldviews and what would they be like?'. The answers would have to relate to, for example, Christian worldviews. Some of the people who consider features of superintelligences say they will have characteristics that are often associated with divinity, raising big open questions for Christian believers. For example, very advanced machines could, perhaps, &amp;nbsp; ultimately engender in people a terrified reverence and mystical awe in the light of, say, an artificial agent's impressive understanding of the human condition. And perhaps some humans might even be induced to 'worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator'? On the other hand what would the agent's relationship to God be? Anyone attempting to accommodate concepts such as an omnipotent, personal creator's sacrificial, emotional, spiritual and attitudinal demands being made of any man-made entity, superintelligent or not, could be said to have strayed into ''terra prohibita'' theologically, of course. And how would the worldviews of any superintelligences handle the relationships with what it might regard as its ''human'' 'creator'?
