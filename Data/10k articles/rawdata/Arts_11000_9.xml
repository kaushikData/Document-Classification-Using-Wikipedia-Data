Starting with his childhood, the book covers Nash's years at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], his work for the [[RAND Corporation]], his [[John Charles Martin Nash|family]] and his struggle with [[schizophrenia]].

Although Nasar notes that Nash did not consider himself a [[homosexual]], she describes his arrest for [[indecent exposure]] and firing from RAND amid the suspicion that he was, then considered grounds for revoking one's [[security clearance]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Beautiful Mind'', pp. 185-186&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ends with Nash being awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]] in 1994. The book is a detailed description of many aspects of Nash's life, including the nature of his mathematical genius, and a close examination of his personality and motivations.

==Reception==

To save his job, Marie looks up her ex-husband Georges, who says he will find Jérôme a place. This he does and, when his lover is away, Marie sleeps with him. However, Jérôme's confidence is gone and Georges has to let him go. When he admits this to Marie, she leaves him. After Jérôme in total despair kills himself, Gabrielle moves in with Marie, who finds herself pregnant again, this time by Georges. Going to see him, she realises there is no future with him and says nothing about her state. This time, she tells her workmates, she is going to have and bring up her baby.

'''''Almond Blossoms''''' is from a group of several paintings made in 1888 and 1890 by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in [[Arles]] and [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence|Saint-Rémy]], [[southern France]] of blossoming [[almond]] trees. Flowering trees were special to van Gogh.  They represented awakening and hope.  He enjoyed them aesthetically and found joy in painting flowering trees. The works reflect the influence of [[Impressionism]], [[Divisionism]], and [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[woodcut]]s. ''Almond Blossom'' was made to celebrate the birth of his nephew and namesake, son of his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] and sister-in-law [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Jo]].

==Southern France==
In 1888 van Gogh became inspired in southern France and began the most productive period of his painting career.  In connection with their painting ''[[Farmhouse in Provence]]'' (1888), the [[National Gallery of Art]] notes that
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was sun that van Gogh sought in Provence, a brilliance and light that would wash out detail and simplify forms,
reducing the world around him to the sort of pattern he admired in Japanese woodblocks. Arles, he said, was "the Japan of the South." Here, he felt, the flattening effect of the sun would strengthen the outlines of compositions and reduce nuances of color to a few vivid contrasts.  Pairs of complements—the red and green of the plants, the woven highlights of oranges and blue in the fence, even the pink clouds that enliven the turquoise sky — almost vibrate against each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |work=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830—1900) |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=National Gallery of Art |url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |page=12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512000557/http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When van Gogh arrived in Arles in March 1888 [[fruit tree]]s in the orchards were about to bloom.&lt;ref name=MancoffVGF49&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=49| isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[blossom]]s of the apricot, peach and plum trees motivated him,&lt;ref name=VGM671&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3128&amp;collection=451&amp;lang=en#moretotell |title=Almond Blossom, 1890  |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within a month he had created fourteen paintings of blossoming fruit trees.&lt;ref name=VGM557&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/collection/s0035V1962 |title=Almond Tree in Blossom, 1888   |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Excited by the subject matter, van Gogh completed nearly one painting a day.&lt;ref name=Fell&gt;{{cite book| author=Fell, D |year=2001 |title=Van Gogh's Gardens | location=United Kingdom |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |page=25 | isbn=0-7432-0233-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QssD77mFRkkC&amp;pg=PA25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around April 21 he wrote to [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], that he "will have to seek something new, now the orchards have almost finished blossoming."&lt;ref name=VGM557/&gt;

[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Bloeiende pruimenboomgaard- naar Hiroshige - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''Japonaiserie Flowering Plum Tree (after Hiroshige)''&lt;br&gt;by Vincent van Gogh, 1887 &lt;br&gt;[[Van Gogh Museum]], [[Amsterdam]] (F371)]]
Van Gogh's work reflected his interest in Japanese [[woodcut|wood block]] prints.  [[Hiroshige]]'s  ''[[Plum Park in Kameido]]'' demonstrates portrayal of beautiful subject matter with flat patterns of colors and no shadow.  Van Gogh used the term ''[[Japonaiserie (Van Gogh)|Japonaiserie]]'' to express this influence; he collected hundreds of Japanese prints and likened the works of the great Japanese artists, like Hiroshige, to those of [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals|Hals]], and [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]].  Hiroshige was one of the last great masters of the Japanese genre called ''[[ukiyo-e]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=54 | isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh integrated some of the technical aspects of ukiyo-e into his work as his two 1887 homages to Hiroshige demonstrates.&lt;ref name="Wallace70"&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853—1890) | author=Wallace, R | publisher=Time-Life Books | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | year=1969 | page=70 | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese paintings represent Van Gogh's search for serenity, which he describes in a letter to his sister, "Having as much of this serenity as possible, even though one knows little – nothing – for certain, is perhaps a better remedy for all diseases than all the things that are sold at the chemist's shop."&lt;ref name="Maurer"&gt;{{cite book | title=The pursuit of spiritual wisdom: the thought and art of Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin | author=Maurer, N | publisher=Associated University Presses | location=Cranbury | year=1999 | origyear=1998 | page=200 | isbn=0-8386-3749-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wf_PoXKhggkC&amp;pg=PA200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The southern region and the flowering trees seems to awakened van Gogh from his doldrums into a state of clear direction, hyper-activity and good cheer.  He wrote, "I am up to my ears in work for the trees are in blossom and I want to paint a Provençal orchard of astonishing gaiety."  While in the past a very active period would have drained him, this time he was invigorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | pages=43–44| isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book''==
Vincent wrote to Theo, "Down here it is freezing hard and there is still snow in the countryside,"  and he has "two small studies of an almond-tree branch already in flower in spite of it."  The two studies are ''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass'' and ''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/466.htm  |title=Vincent van Gogh. Letter to Theo van Gogh. Written c. 3 March 1888 in Arles.  |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits  |accessdate=2011-04-23  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass''==
Although [[fruit tree]]s were about to bloom when Vincent arrived in Arles,&lt;ref name=MancoffVGF49/&gt; the town had just received a layer of snow, driving van Gogh inside for his first week in Arles where he worked on still life, such as a branch from an almond tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=2515&amp;collection=451&amp;lang=en |title=Sprig of Flowering Almond Blossom in a Glass, 1888 |year=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To reflect the early signs of spring, he used delicate brushstrokes and pastel shades for ''Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass''.&lt;ref name=MancoffVGF49/&gt;

In ''Art Inspiring Transmutations of Life'', [[Bruce Ross]] evaluates the [[Impressionism|Impressionists']] effect on van Gogh's work, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Van Gogh's bright ''Sprig of Flowering Almond in a Glass'' embodies these streams* while exploring Japanese aesthetic values. A broken-off sprig is set in a simple glass.  The sprig is highlighted by a red line along the beige wall and lavish empty space.  There is no formal decorative intent.  Van Gogh's name, also in bright red, hovers above a sprig in the upper left as if a symbol of hope.  Van Gogh has transformed the still  life with the help of these values.  He has imbued a form predicated on death to one focused on life and possibility.  His use of bright color reflects this.  There is an individual, and hence essential, character to his subject, a sprig of almond buds and opening blossoms. This still life resembles the Japanese art of flower arrangement, [[ikebana]], in its simplicity and evoked hopefulness as well as in its formal use of empty space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Art Inspiring Transmutations of Life | author=Ross, B | editor=Trutty-Coohill, P  | publisher=Springer | location=Heidelberg, London, and New York | year=2010 | pages=215–216| chapter=Vincent van Gogh's Irises: Venturing Upon Dizzy Heights | isbn=978-90-481-9159-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AmIacB5qVZ0C&amp;pg=PA215|quote=These streams include: 1) French impressionist's practice of using unadorned objects from life and 2) use of space between objects as objects themselves to the point of over-orchestration. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Almond Blossom''==
[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Almond blossom - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|''Almond blossom'', 1890 &lt;br&gt;[[Van Gogh Museum]], (F671)]]  
In mid-March 1888 van Gogh writes of the weather and that the almond trees are coming into full flower, "The weather here is changeable, often windy with turbulent skies, but the almond trees are beginning to flower everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/469.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh. Letter to Theo van Gogh. Written c. 14 March 1888 in Arles. |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits   |accessdate=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mancoff says of flowering trees and this work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=41 | isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In his flowering trees, Vincent attained a sense of spontaneity, freeing himself from the strict self-analytical approach he took in Paris. In ''Almond Tree in Blossom'', Vincent used the light, broken strokes of impressionism and the dabs of colour of [[divisionism]] for a sparkling surface effect.  The distinctive contours of the tree and its position in the foreground recall the formal qualities of Japanese prints."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rendering of ''Almond Blossom'' is positioned close and accessible to the viewer and the branches appear to reach out beyond the painting's frame.

Theo wrote to his brother Vincent on January 31, 1890 to announce the birth of his son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. As a means of celebration, Vincent began work on a painting for Theo and his wife.  He was very close to his brother and he sought to symbolize new life in the flowers of the almond tree for the birth of baby Vincent.&lt;ref name=VGM671/&gt;

Vincent wrote to his mother of the birth of Theo and [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Jo's]] baby,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"How glad I was when the news came... I should have greatly preferred him to call the boy after Father, of whom I have been thinking so much these days, instead of after me; but seeing it has now been done, I started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, big branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/627.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh. Letter to His Mother. Written c. 20 February 1890 in Saint-Rémy. |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits |accessdate=2011-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The composition is unlike any other of van Gogh's paintings. The branches of the almond tree seem to float against the blue sky and fill the picture plane.&lt;ref name=VGM671/&gt; The close-up of the branches brings to mind [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s proposition that "even a part of a thing is kind of a complete entity in itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Flowers | author=Mancoff, D | publisher=Frances Lincoln Limited | location=London | year=2008 | page=41 | isbn=978-0-7112-2908-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRbgR7QtwvgC&amp;pg=PA41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dark lines outline the branches. This is a feature that Van Gogh had admired in Japanese floral studies that, for example, may depict a portion of a stalk of bamboo in an empty space.&lt;ref name=VGM671/&gt;  The bright color is reflective of the paintings made in Arles and the transformational work van Gogh had on the still life genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Venturing Upon Dizzy Heights: Lectures and Essays on Philosophy, Literature and the Arts | author=Ross, B | publisher=Peter Lang Publishing | location=New York | year=208 | page=52 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_HvvB-xrxxUC&amp;pg=PA52 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Klee, paul, angelus novus, 1920.jpg|''Angelus Novus''|thumb|right|240px]]

'''''Angelus Novus''''' (New Angel) is a 1920 [[monoprint]] by the Swiss-German artist [[Paul Klee]], using the oil transfer method he invented. It is now in the collection of the [[Israel Museum]] in [[Jerusalem]].

In the ninth thesis of his 1940 essay “[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]”, the German critic and philosopher [[Walter Benjamin]], who purchased the print in 1921, interprets it this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Klee painting named ''Angelus Novus'' shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, "[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]", Illuminations, trans.

Otto Karl Werckmeister notes that Benjamin's reading of Klee's New Angel image has led to it becoming "an icon of the [[political left|left]]."&lt;ref&gt;Werkmeister, ''Icons of the Left: Benjamin and Einstein, Picasso and Kafka After the Fall.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997: 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name and concept of the angel has inspired works by other artists, filmmakers, writers and musicians, including [[John Akomfrah]], [[Ariella Azoulay]], [[Carolyn Forché]], and [[Rabih Alameddine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lux.org.uk/collection/works/last-angel-history|title= ''Last Angel of History''|year=2013|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zingmagazine.com/zing6/reviews/angelus.html|title= zing6 - reviews - angelus nova|publisher=''Zing Magazine''|year=1997|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/sandh/2000/june00/munchener.htm|title= Seventh Munchener Biennale|date=4–19 May 2000|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1940 Walter Benjamin committed suicide during an attempt to flee the Nazi regime. After World War II Walter Benjamin’s lifelong friend, [[Gershom Scholem]] (1897–1982), the distinguished scholar of Jewish mysticism, inherited the drawing. According to Scholem, Benjamin felt a mystical identification with the ''Angelus Novus'' and incorporated it in his theory of the “angel of history,” a melancholy view of historical process as an unceasing cycle of despair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/imagine/collections/item.asp?itemNum=199799 Angelus Novus] at the [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ardabil Carpets''' ('''Ardebil Carpets''') are a pair of famous [[Persian carpet]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beattie|first1=M.|title=ARDABĪL CARPET – Encyclopaedia Iranica|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ardabil-carpet-persian-carpet-acquired-by-the-victoria-and-albert-museum-in-1893|website=www.iranicaonline.org|publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Ardabil Carpet|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ardabil-Carpet|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the collections of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]] and the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]].  They are examples of [[Ardabil rug]]s.

The foundation is of [[silk]] with [[wool]] pile of a [[knot density]] at 300–350 [[knot density|knots per]] square inch (47–54 knots per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The size of the London carpet is {{convert|34+1/2|x|17+1/2|ft|m}}, which gives it about 26 million knots in total.&lt;ref name="Jozan"/&gt; The carpets have an inscription: a [[couplet]] from a [[ghazal]] by Persian mythic poet [[Hafiz Shirazi]] and a signature.&lt;ref name="Inscription"/&gt; The difference in size between the two lamp motifs flanking the central medallion is now seen as a deliberate use of [[graphical perspective]]; when seen from the end with the smaller lamp the two appear the same size.&lt;ref&gt;Hillier&lt;/ref&gt;  The design of the central medallion resembles that of the interior side of the dome of the [[Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque]] in Isfahan.

Completed during the rule of the [[Safavid]] [[Shah]] [[Tahmasp I]] in the mid-16th century, probably in [[Tabriz]], the carpets are considered some of the best of the classical Iranian (Persian) school of carpet creation. They were first placed in a [[mosque]] in [[Ardabil]], but they had become heavily worn in [[Iran]] and were sold in 1890&lt;ref name="Getty autobiography"/&gt; to a [[United Kingdom|British]] carpet broker who restored one of the carpets using the other and then resold the restored one to the Victoria and Albert Museum. [[William Morris]], then an [[Peer review|art referee]] for the V&amp;A, was instrumental in the acquisition.&lt;ref name="Perspective"/&gt;

The second "secret" carpet, smaller, now borderless and with some of the field missing, and made up from the remaining usable sections, was sold to American businessmen [[Clarence Mackay]] and was exchanged by wealthy buyers for years. Passing through the Mackay, [[Charles Yerkes|Yerkes]], and De la Mare art collections, it was eventually revealed and shown in 1931 at an exhibition in [[London]]. American industrialist [[J. Paul Getty]] saw it, and bought it from Lord Duveen for approximately $70,000 several years later. Getty was approached by agents on behalf of King [[Farouk of Egypt]] who offered $250,000 so that it could be given as a wedding present to [[Fawzia Fuad of Egypt|his sister]] and the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]].&lt;ref name="Farouk"/&gt; Getty later donated the carpet to the Los Angeles County Museum of Science, History, and Art in the [[Exposition Park (Los Angeles)|Exposition Park]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Other fragments have appeared on the market from time to time. The knot density is actually higher on the Los Angeles carpet.&lt;ref&gt;Hillier&lt;/ref&gt; 

This Persian carpet has been the subject of numerous copies ranging in size from small rugs to full scale carpets. There is an 'Ardabil' at [[10 Downing Street]] and even [[Hitler]] had an 'Ardabil' in his office in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Perspective"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geometry"/&gt; The London carpet was for decades displayed hanging on a wall. Since 2006, it has been shown flat in a special glass pavilion in the centre of the main gallery of [[Islamic art]]. The lighting is kept low to prevent fading.&lt;ref&gt;Hillier&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The 'Ardebil' carpet, now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in [[London]], is probably the best known of all old Persian carpets. It is one of a pair which came to [[England]] in 1893 virtually in tatters. The decision was made to sacrifice one carpet so that the other could be restored. The cost of this work was prohibitively high, even for a museum, and it was only after an extensive public appeal that sufficient funds were raised for work to go ahead. There can be little doubt that in this case the end justified the means. The carpet, measuring 38′ long by 18′ wide, is an extremely fine specimen bearing an inscription by the weaver. This inscription reads:&lt;blockquote&gt;''I have no refuge in the world other than thy threshold.&lt;br /&gt;There is no protection for my head other than this door.''&lt;br /&gt;''The work of the servant of the threshold Maqsud of Kashan in the year 946.''&lt;/blockquote&gt; Translating this date into the Christian calendar shows that the carpet was woven around the years 1539–40 during the reign of [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]], one of the great patrons of carpet weaving. The incomplete remainder of the other 'Ardebil' carpet, which bears the same inscription and date, was given by [[J. Paul Getty]] to the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|Los Angeles County Museum]].|[[Essie Sakhai]]|The Story of Carpet.&lt;ref name="Sakhai"/&gt;}}

[[File:Elizabeth I Rainbow Portrait.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The ''Rainbow Portrait'', an image of Elizabeth I as the "Queen of Love and Beauty" by [[Isaac Oliver]] c. 1600, epitomizes the elaborate iconography associated with later Tudor court portraiture&lt;ref name="Strong 1977"&gt;Strong 1987, p. 50-52&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The '''artists of the Tudor court''' are the [[Painting|painters]] and [[Illuminated manuscript|limners]] engaged by the [[monarch]]s of [[Kingdom of England|England's]] [[Tudor dynasty]] and their [[courtier]]s between 1485 and 1603, from the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] to the death of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].

Typically managing a group of assistants and [[apprentice]]s in a [[workshop]] or [[studio]], many of these artists produced works across several disciplines, including [[portrait miniature]]s, large-scale [[panel painting|panel portraits]] on wood, [[illuminated manuscript]]s, [[heraldry|heraldric emblems]], and elaborate  decorative schemes for [[masque]]s, [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]], and other events.

== Isolation and iconography ==
[[File:Holbein Jane Seymour drawing.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Drawing of Jane Seymour by Holbein, 1536–37]]
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Portrait of Jane Seymour by Holbein, 1536–37]]

The Tudor period was one of unusual isolation from European trends for England.  At the start the [[Wars of the Roses]] had greatly disrupted artistic activity, which apart from architecture had reached a very low ebb by 1485.  The [[House of York|Yorkist dynasty]] overthrown by the Tudors had been very close to their [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] allies, and English diplomats had their portraits painted by the finest [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painters]] - Edward Grimshaw by [[Petrus Christus]] and [[Sir John Donne]] by [[Hans Memling]] (both [[National Gallery, London]]{{efn|The Grimshaw on loan. Grimshaw was a Lancastrian, or at least [[Henry VI of England]]'s agent before the Wars of the Roses began, Donne a Yorkist.}}).  However these were both painted abroad.  In the Tudor period foreign artists were recruited and often welcomed lavishly by the English court, as they were in other artistically marginal parts of Europe like Spain or Naples.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn (2001), which mainly deals with the Jacobean court&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlandish painters remained predominant, though French influence was also important on both [[Lucas Horenbout]] and [[Nicholas Hilliard]], respectively the founder and the greatest exponent of the distinctively English tradition of the [[portrait miniature]].

With the virtual extinction of religious painting at the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and little interest in [[classical mythology]] until the very end of the period, the [[portrait]] was the most important form of painting for all the artists of the Tudor court, and the only one to have survived in any numbers.  How many of these have been also lost can be seen from Holbein's book (nearly all pages in the [[Royal Collection]]) containing preparatory drawings for portraits - of eighty-five drawings, only a handful have surviving Holbein paintings, though often copies have survived.&lt;ref&gt;''Holbein and the Court of Henry VIII'', pp. 11, 16; 1978, The Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace&lt;/ref&gt;  Portraiture ranged from the informal miniature, almost invariably painted from life in the course of a few days and intended for private contemplation,&lt;ref name="Strong 1983"&gt;Strong 1983&lt;/ref&gt; to the later large-scale [[portraiture of Elizabeth I|portraits of Elizabeth I]] such as the ''Rainbow Portrait'', filled with [[symbol]]ic [[iconography]] in [[clothing|dress]], [[jewellery|jewels]], background, and inscription.&lt;ref name="Strong 1987"&gt;Strong 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Much energy was also expended on decorative painting of fixtures and fittings, often of a very temporary nature.  In theory the "[[Serjeant Painter]]s" of the King, a lower rank of painter, did most of this, probably to the designs of the more elevated "King's Painters" (or Queen's), but it is clear that they too spent time on this, as did court artists all over Europe (see [[Royal Entry]]). There was also the [[Master of the Revels]], whose Office was responsible for festivals and tournaments, and no doubt called upon the artists and Serjeant Painters for assistance.

Jewellery and metalwork were regarded as extremely important, and far more was spent on them than on painting. Holbein produced many spectacular designs for now-vanished table ornaments in precious metals, and Hilliard was also a practising goldsmith.  The main artistic interests of Henry VIII were music, building palaces and [[tapestry]], of which he had over 2,000 pieces, costing far more than he ever spent on painters.  The Flemish set with [[The Story of Abraham (tapestries)|the ''Story of Abraham'']] still at [[Hampton Court Palace]] is one grand set from late in his reign.
[[File:Nonsuch Palace watercolour detail.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Detail of [[Joris Hoefnagel|Georg Hoefnagel]]'s 1568 watercolour of the south frontage of [[Nonsuch Palace]], one of the only two good images - which differ considerably. The stucco reliefs are shown in blue-ish grey.]] 

Elizabeth spent far less, hardly building anything herself, but took a personal interest in painting, keeping her own collection of miniatures locked away, wrapped in paper on which she wrote the names of the sitter. She is reputed to have had paintings of her burnt that did not match the iconic image she wished to be shown.

The most progressive and spectacular palace of the Tudor period, [[Nonsuch Palace]], begun by Henry VIII in 1538 a little way south of London, was covered inside and out with prodigious quantities of figurative sculpted stucco reliefs - the whole scheme covered over 2,000 square metres (21,000 sq ft).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/881688 JSTOR Burlington Magazine, The Stuccos of Nonsuch by [[Martin Biddle]]]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also probably much decorative painting.  As for the similar work at the [[Château de Fontainebleau]], which Nonsuch was certainly intended to compete with, and outshine, Italians were brought in to provide authentic [[Mannerist]] work, however much the general plan remains English.  The scattered fragments and images that have survived suggest that the awestruck accounts of visitors were not exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britarch.ac.uk/BA/ba60/feat1.shtml British Archaeology], [http://www.sutton.gov.uk/leisure/heritage/Cheam/ Sutton - views of interior] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622181104/http://www.sutton.gov.uk/leisure/heritage/Cheam/ |date=June 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== A community of artists ==
[[File:Joris Hoefnagel Fete at Bermondsey c 1569 detail.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Exiled Flemish artists in England?{{efn|Strong 1969 suggests that Hoefnagel and fellow Flemish exiles are sitting beneath the tree.}} Detail of [[:File:Joris Hoefnagel Fete at Bermondsey c 1569.jpg|A Fête at Bermondsey]].]]

Many of the artists active at the Tudor court were connected by ties of family, marriage, and training.  [[Lucas Horenbout]] (often called Hornebolt in England), who began painting and illuminating for [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in the mid-1520s, was accompanied in his workshop by his sister [[Susannah Hornebolt|Susannah]], who was also an illuminator. It is generally accepted{{efn|[[Karel van Mander]] says Holbein was taught the art by a "Master Lucas", and there is a miniature of Holbein by Horenbout.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1981, p. 37. &lt;/ref&gt;}} that Lucas Horenbout taught [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] the techniques of painting miniatures on vellum when Holbein was engaged by Henry VIII in the early 1530s.

Lucas and Susanna Horenbout's father, [[Gerard Horenbout]] - possibly he was the [[Master of James IV of Scotland]] - was an active member of the [[Ghent-Bruges school]] of manuscript illustrators and also was employed briefly at the Tudor court.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1981, p. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; In Bruges, Gerard was associated with [[Sanders Bening]] or Benninck and his son [[Simon Bening|Simon]], with whom he worked on the illustrations for the [[Grimani Breviary]].  Simon Bening's eldest daughter [[Levina Teerlinc]] was also trained as an illuminator.  She entered the service of Henry VIII at the close of 1546 following the deaths of Holbein (1543) and Lucas Horenbout (1544), and would remain as court painter to Henry's son [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1981, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; and as painter and lady-in-waiting to both his daughters, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and Elizabeth.  Levina Teerlinc, in turn, taught the art of limning to Nicholas Hilliard, an apprentice [[goldsmith]] who would marry the daughter of Queen Elizabeth's jeweler and rise to become the supreme miniaturist of the age. [[John Bettes the Elder]] apprenticed his son, [[John Bettes the Younger|John the Younger]] to Hilliard.  Hilliard's most famous student, [[Isaac Oliver]], later limner to [[Anne of Denmark]] and [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], was married to the niece of [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]].&lt;ref name="Hearn 130"&gt;Hearn, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  Gheeraerts was also the brother-in-law of [[Lucas de Heere]]'s apprentice [[John de Critz|John de Critz the Elder]],&lt;ref name="Hearn 130" /&gt; who took the dynasty into the Stuart period, and was succeeded as Serjeant-Painter by his son.  De Heere was also a religious refugee from [[Flanders]]; although the upheavals of the [[Protestant Reformation]] acted to reduce artistic contacts, especially with Italy, England could also benefit from them.

*"[[Antony Toto]]", really Antonio di Nunziato d'Antonio, a Florentine pupil of [[Ridolfo Ghirlandajo]], from 1544, who died in office in 1554.  He was the first Serjeant Painter who can be evidenced as an artist rather than an artisan. None of his paintings are known to survive, but his New Year gifts to Henry, presumably his own work, are documented as including a ''Calumny of [[Apelles]]'' (1538/39) and a ''Story of King Alexander'' (1540/41), and then in 1552 a portrait of a duke "steyned upon cloth of silver" for Edward VI.  He had a Florentine colleague [[Bartolommeo Penni]], brother of the much more distinguished [[Gianfrancesco Penni|Gianfrancesco]], [[Raphael]]'s right-hand man, and Luca, a member of the [[School of Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=296 Getty biography of Luca]&lt;/ref&gt;  Both probably came to Henry from [[Cardinal Wolsey]], as they first appear in the accounts just after Wolsey's fall in October 1529.  "Toto" had been signed on in Florence in 1519 as an assistant to [[Pietro Torrigiano]], who in fact left England for good later that year.  Toto and Penni spent most of their time after 1538 working on [[Nonsuch Palace]], including elaborate stucco work for Henry's most advanced building, now vanished.

== Identification and attribution ==
[[File:Mary Nevill and Gregory Fiennes Baron Dacre v.2.jpg|left|thumb|250px|This portrait was misidentified for 250 years.]]

Many surviving images have been badly worn over the years, or incompetently "restored". Inscriptions are often later than the paintings themselves, and may reflect wishful thinking; many anonymous Tudor ladies were identified as "Mary I", or, especially, one or other of Henry VIII's queens, by the owners of pictures.  [[Anne Boleyn]] in particular has been said to be the subject of dozens of pictures; even now there is no certain image of her done from life, and the [http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?search=ss&amp;sText=anne+boleyn&amp;LinkID=mp00109&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=sit most plausible],&lt;ref&gt;according to Strong 1969&lt;/ref&gt; is a later copy and among the least informative.  The only probable portrait of [[Catherine Howard]], a miniature by Holbein in the Royal Collection, is only identified by circumstantial evidence (see Gallery).&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1983):50&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Strong is persuaded for various reasons: two Holbein versions exist ([[Royal Collection]], Windsor &amp; [[Duke of Buccleuch]]), which is only known for queens among female sitters for Tudor miniatures; she wears the same jewel as Jane Seymour in the Vienna Holbein (shown above); the pearls may tie in with a gift to Catherine from Henry in 1540, and she is the only Queen to fit. There are no other plausible likenesses of her to compare to.  Both versions have long been known as of Catherine Howard. This is the Windsor version, considered the original done from life.}}

A well-known painting (left) was identified by [[George Vertue]] in 1727 as [[Lady Frances Brandon]] and her second husband Adrian Stokes, an attribution that stood unquestioned until the sitters were properly identified as [[Mary Nevill, Baroness Dacre]] and her son [[Gregory Fiennes, 10th Baron Dacre]] and the artist as Hans Eworth in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Based on the ages of sitters and a ring worn by Mary Nevill; see Hearn, p. 68; see also Honig, "In Memory: Lady Dacre and Pairing by Hans Eworth" in ''Renaissance Bodies: The Human Figure in English Culture c. 1540–1660.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Attribution to artists is even more challenging; not all artists signed their work, and those who did may not have done so consistently.  Many pictures have been cut down, extended, or otherwise altered in ways that damage or destroy inscriptions.  Artists' workshops often churned out copies of the master's work to meet the demand for portraits, as symbols of devotion to the Crown or simply to populate the fashionable "long galleries" lined with portraits.

Today, attributions are made on the basis of style, sitter, accepted date, and related documentation such as receipts or bills for payment and inventories of collections or estates.  It is now generally accepted that the artist known as "The Monogrammist HE" is Hans Eworth,&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; but other identifications remain elusive.  Some of the most well-known images of the period, such as the portrait of ''Elizabeth I when a Princess'', age 13, have been attributed to many artists over the years, but remain cautiously labelled "?Flemish School" in recent catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;  Much scholarly debate also circles around identification of possible portraits of [[Lady Jane Grey]].{{efn|1= See [https://www.theguardian.com/arts/news/story/0,11711,1687349,00.html "Is this the true face of Lady Jane?"] - article from ''[[The Guardian]]'', 16 January 2006, describing a portrait (found in a South London home) that purportedly depicts Lady Jane Grey, and discussion of two portraits identified in 2005 as depicting Lady Jane at [http://www.somegreymatter.com SomeGreyMatter].}}

==Payments==
The royal accounts for the period survive, but are not always easy to interpret. Payments often covered expensive materials, and in many cases the wages of assistants had to be paid out of them. Some regular annuities, usually supplemented by payments for specific works, are given below.  But recipients were expected to give works to the monarch, at New Year or on their birthday.

Royal annuities:
*Lucas Hornebolte (scholarly dissention) £33 6s&lt;ref&gt;T Kren &amp; S McKendrick (eds), ''Illuminating the Renaissance: The Triumph of Flemish Manuscript Painting in Europe'', p.434, Getty Museum/Royal Academy of Arts, 2003, {{ISBN|1-903973-28-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or £62 10s from 1525 "until his death"&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1983):34&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hans Holbein £30 (but he did more work outside the court)&lt;ref&gt;Kren, 434.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Levina Teerlinc £40&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1983):52&lt;/ref&gt;
*Nicholas Hilliard received £400 as a gift in 1591, and an annuity of £40 from 1599;&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1983):72&lt;/ref&gt; he typically charged £3 for a non-royal miniature.

The sums spent on metalwork, building palaces, and by Henry on tapestries, dwarfed these figures.

== History ==
[[File:HanoverTavernHanoverVirginia.JPG|thumb|The historic Hanover Tavern]]
On August 1, 1953, six actors, two children, a dog and two pigs moved into a historic ruin called Hanover Tavern. The transplanted New Yorkers founded Central Virginia’s first professional theatre, and named the company in memory of a deceased college friend, Barbara Barksdale.  When they learned that their new neighbors looked forward to eating on evenings out, they combined favorite recipes and created the nation’s first [[dinner theater]].&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith, Kate: [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/theater/10galb.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;oref=slogin] New York Times December 10, 2006; Do-It-Yourself Entertainment, Way Off Broadway Retrieved 2008-10-01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calos, Katherine: {{cite web|url=http://www.discoverrichmond.com/dis/lifestyles/local_communities/hanover/article/no_barking_at_barksdale/1257/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021215448/http://www.discoverrichmond.com/dis/lifestyles/local_communities/hanover/article/no_barking_at_barksdale/1257/ |archivedate=2008-10-21 }} DiscoverRichmond.com, July 22, 2008. No Barking at Barksdale; Retrieved 2008-10-01&lt;/ref&gt; They lived upstairs, performed downstairs, and served hearty meals in the historic rooms that fell in between.

During the first six years, four of the original founders moved on, leaving Pete Kilgore, Muriel McAuley and newcomer (and newly-wed) Nancy Kilgore firmly in charge. In the seasons that followed, Pete, Muriel and Nancy produced Greater Richmond’s first professional productions of plays by [[Tennessee Williams]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Eugene O’Neill]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Noël Coward]], [[Thornton Wilder]], [[William Inge]] and [[Edward Albee]].

Copyright 1984. {{ISBN|0-9613905-0-6}}. Printed by Taylor Publishing Company, Dallas, Texas&lt;/ref&gt; Barksdale was Virginia’s first performing arts organization to open its doors to integrated audiences. Barksdale launched Greater Richmond’s first “studio season,” converting an old country store into an experimental theatre. Barksdale conducted Virginia’s first professional theatre classes for children. In 1973, Barksdale produced Virginia’s first professional play based on African American experience, [[Lorraine Hansberry]]’s [[To Be Young, Gifted and Black]].

In support of their theatrical mission, Pete, Muriel and Nancy continued the endless task of restoring the Tavern. In 1990, the Tavern was sold to the Hanover Tavern Foundation. In 1993, Pete, Muriel and Nancy retired after 40 years of exemplary service. John Glenn was named Artistic Director. In 1996, to accommodate a full restoration of its beloved home, Barksdale left the Tavern for new facilities at Willow Lawn. In 1997, John Glenn left to pursue other opportunities, and Randy Strawderman was hired to replace him.

In 2001, leadership was transferred to Bruce Miller and Phil Whiteway, Artistic Director and Managing Director, respectively. Under their leadership, the company’s reputation for artistic excellence continued to grow. Subscriptions increased by 700%, and after a ten-year separation, Barksdale returned theatrical programming to Hanover Tavern in January 2006, initiating a four-play Country Playhouse Season designed to complement its five-play Signature Season at Willow Lawn.&lt;ref name="barksdalerichmond.org" /&gt;

Bruce and Phil had also held the positions of Founding Artistic Director and Founding Managing Director at Theatre IV since 1975.  After the leadership of Barksdale was transferred to them in 2001, Barksdale Theatre and Theatre IV shared a common staff.

[[File:Jagiellonian Ms.Germ.Quart.16 (Gladiatoria) 01r.jpg|thumb|300px|''Gladiatoria'' fencing manual, 15th century, front cover with stamp ''Ex Biblioth. Regia Berolinensi.'']]
The '''''Berlinka''''' ('Berliner'), also '''Pruski skarb''' ('Prussian Treasure'), is the [[Polish language|Polish]] name for a collection of [[Germany|German]] original [[manuscript]]s originally kept at the [[Berlin State Library|Prussian State Library]] in [[Berlin]], which since the end of [[World War II]] are held by the [[Jagiellonian Library]] in [[Kraków]]. The legal status of the documents is subject of an ongoing debate.

==History==
During the Second World War from September 1942 onwards, German authorities moved the material from Berlin to the seized abbey of [[Krzeszów Abbey|Grüssau]] (present-day Krzeszów) in Prussian [[Province of Lower Silesia|Lower Silesia]], in order to protect it from [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[bombing of Berlin in World War II|strategic bombing]]. When the Lower Silesian territory east of the [[Oder–Neisse line]] fell under the administrative sovereignty of the [[People's Republic of Poland|Republic of Poland]] after the war, the Polish government secretly claimed the collection as [[war reparations]].&lt;ref name="GW2007"/&gt; In the winter of 1945/1946, the inventories were removed by Polish ''[[Milicja Obywatelska|milicja]]'' and thereafter transferred to Kraków.

In 1965, the Polish and the [[East Germany|East German]] government signed an agreement on the return of large collections of the Prussian State Library; however, the Polish authorities kept the ''Berlinka''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s existence at the Jagiellonian Library a secret until 1977, when Polish First Secretary [[Edward Gierek]] presenting his East German counterpart [[Erich Honecker]] with seven pieces of [[sheet music]], including Mozart's original score of ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' and Beethoven's notes for his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]],&lt;ref name="SPON-070808"&gt;{{de icon}}[[Der Spiegel]]: BEUTEKUNST-RÜCKGABE Polen stellt sich stur, 8 August 2007 [http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,498915,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as a gift.

==Debate==
Since the jurisdiction of the [[former eastern territories of Germany]] was withdrawn by the 1945 [[Potsdam Agreement]],  Poland claims that it should retain ownership of the ''Berlinka'' as compensation for Polish cultural assets destroyed or [[World War II looting of Poland|looted by Germans during the Second World War]]; the total worth of Polish cultural heritage destroyed by [[Nazi Germany]], especially after the failed [[Warsaw Uprising]] in 1944, is estimated at 20 billion dollars.&lt;ref name="GW2007"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://serwisy.gazeta.pl/swiat/1,34239,4554829.html Rosjanie oddają skradzione dzieła sztuki], Gazeta Wyborcza, 2007-10-14&lt;/ref&gt; Some German media have referred to the ''Berlinka'' as the "last German [[prisoner of war]]". The German government claims that Poland is in violation of Article 56 of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention of 1907]],&lt;ref name="FAZ-060726"&gt;{{de icon}}[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]: ''Rückgabe von Beutekunst - Die letzten deutschen Kriegsgefangenen'', 26 July 2007, [http://www.faz.net/s/RubEBED639C476B407798B1CE808F1F6632/Doc~E73D9568D79A14F7CB8686D42EC8ACD04~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html]&lt;/ref&gt; while the Polish side emphasizes the fact that the collections were not [[looted art|looted]], but were situated on Polish territory after the war.

After the [[Revolutions of 1989]], the Polish–German [[Treaty of Good Neighbourship]] was signed in 1991 and several negotiations have taken place in order to clarify and confirm the whereabouts of the ''Berlinka''. Poland has undertaken several initiatives, such as in 2000 when Foreign Minister [[Władysław Bartoszewski]] proposed establishing a Polish–German foundation that would take possession of such disputed collections. However, the German government refused – according to Bartoszewski, resulting from the fact that Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] did not realise the offer. While Germany each time is demanding that Poland return the ''Berlinka'' unconditionally, Poland refuses, claiming that Germany still has much Polish material looted during World War II, and that this should be returned to Poland in exchange.&lt;ref name="GW2007"/&gt;

In summer 2007, ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine quoted German [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]] representative Julia Gross as saying that proceedings over the disposition had reached a low point. Earlier, Poland had stated that return is out of the question.&lt;ref name="SPON-070808"/&gt; In 2014 Germany returned to Poland the looted painting ''Palace Stairs'' by [[Francesco Guardi]]. With this gesture, Germany hopes to restart negotiations for the return of ''Berlinka''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26829148 | title=Germany returns art stolen by Nazis in 1939 to Poland | publisher=BBC News | date=31 March 2014 | accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
[[File:100 3493.JPG|thumb|Jagiellonian Library, Kraków]]
The ''Berlinka'' comprises some of the most valuable holdings of the former Prussian State Library. It includes over 500,000 medieval manuscripts, early modern printings and [[autograph]]s, including by [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[Johannes Calvin|Calvin]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]. Among the holdings are notable letters from the large estate of [[Ludmilla Assing]] and her uncle [[Karl August Varnhagen von Ense]], personal copies of the ''[[Deutsches Wörterbuch]]'' with hand-written notes by the [[Brothers Grimm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} German TV HR: ''Handexemplare des Grimmschen Wörterbuchs in Krakau gefunden'' [https://archive.is/20090620212702/http://www.hr-online.de/website/rubriken/kultur/index.jsp?rubrik=5982&amp;key=standard_document_16755474 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and original musical scores by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and his sons, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] (''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]''), [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy|Mendelssohn-Bartholdy]], [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]], [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]], [[Luigi Cherubini|Cherubini]], and [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]]. On the other hand, the collections also comprise many manuscripts and [[incunable]]s from Polish monasteries in [[Gniezno]], [[Lubiń, Kościan County|Lubiń]], [[Mogilno]], [[Pakość]], [[Gościkowo|Paradyż]], [[Pelplin]] and [[Poznań]], removed between 1820 and 1840 by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] authorities from the territories gained in the [[Partitions of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;''(...) do słynnej Pruskiej Biblioteki Państwowej w Berlinie włączono starodruki pochodzące z klasztorów w Gnieźnie, Lubiniu, Mogilnie, Pakości, Paradyżu, Pelplinie i Poznaniu.''&lt;br&gt; {{cite web  |author =Jan Pruszyński |url =http://www.wprost.pl/ar/70605/Kulturkampf/|title = Kulturkampf |work =www.wprost.pl |publisher =  |pages =  |page =  |date = |accessdate = 2009-11-21|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Listed under separate [[provenance]], the collections today are accessible for researchers and post-graduate students only. After a number of incunables from the Jagiellonian Library were found at auctions, user conditions were tightened again in 1999.

==History==
''See also [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped#History|National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]]''

In 1931, the United States passed the [[Pratt-Smoot Act]] to provide blind adults with access to books.  Before audio recordings, books were made available in [[braille]]. Beginning with 19 libraries in 1931, the network as of March 2018 was 55 regional libraries, 32 subregional libraries, and 14 advisory and outreach centers serving the United States and its territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/nls/about/network-libraries/about-local-network-libraries/|title=About Local Network Libraries - National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) {{!}} Library of Congress|work=National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) {{!}} Library of Congress|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was expanded in 1952 to include blind children, in 1962 to include music materials, and in 1966 to include individuals with physical impairments that prevent the reading of standard print.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/nls/reference/factsheets/copyright.html NLS Factsheets: Copyright Law Amendment, 1996: PL 104-197&lt;/ref&gt; The Books for the Blind Program was the model for the effort in the 1950s for captioned films for the deaf leading to the [[Captioned Films Act of 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dcmp.org/learn/379-described-and-captioned-media-program-seventy-years-of-progress|title=Described and Captioned Media Program: Seventy Years of Progress|website=dcmp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio recordings were first created on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] when [[Pratt-Smoot Act]] was amended in 1933 to include "talking books", and later, in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Information Literacies for the Twenty-First Century |chapter=Something New Has Been Added: Aural Literacy and Libraries |publisher=G. K. Hall &amp; Co. |author=Virgil L. P.

Currently, books for the blind and visually impaired can be downloaded from the NLS's Braille and Audio Reading Download (BARD) system, which allows for digital books on desktop computers and some [[mobile device]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/nls/about/services/braille-audio-reading-download-bard/|title=Braille and Audio Reading Download (BARD) - National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) {{!}} Library of Congress|work=National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) {{!}} Library of Congress|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a "wi-fi" symbol was added to the NLS's logo to represent the inclusion of wireless connectivity to the programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dbs.myflorida.com/Library/Newsletter/2016-fall-eng.html|title=Florida Division of Blind Services|website=dbs.myflorida.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===''Point,'' 2005===

In 2005, fellow Hunter [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] graduates, Danielle Mysliwiec, Elaine Kaufmann, Maria Dumlao, Anne Polashenski, and Jane Johnston and four volunteers, stood outside of [[MoMA PS1|P.S.1]]'s entrance in a colorful curly wigs, their faces painted and stood pointing directly at the institution, for six hours. ''Point'' was a performance that called attention to the fact of the all-important New York City exhibition's roster of artists being over two-thirds male in a time when the numbers of women in art programs exceeded that of men.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/davis/davis3-12-07.asp|title=White Walls, Glass Ceiling|last=Davis|first=Ben|date=March 12, 2007|publisher=Artnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hoban&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoban|first=Phoebe|title=The Feminist Evolution|url=http://www.artnews.com/2009/12/01/the-feminist-evolution/|work=ArtNews|accessdate=10 January 2014|date=December 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group drew on earlier feminist art protest work of the [[Guerrilla Girls]], with whom they have collaborated.&lt;ref name=hoban/&gt; Polashenski and Johnston (the latter a co-founder of the group with Mysliwiec, Kaufmann, and Dumlao) have since left the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainstormersreport.net/|title=Brainstormers|accessdate=Feb 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===

In 2005, the Brainstormers performed again, in a piece entitled ''How Good Are You?'' outside the entrance to the Armory Show, dressed in [[lab coat]]s, handing out color-coded research about the levels of representation of women artists in [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] art galleries.&lt;ref name=BR/&gt; The next year Dumlao, Kaufmann, Mysliwiec, and Polashenski published a researched piece entitled "The Cutting Edge and the Corporate Agenda" in the international journal ''Women &amp; Environments,'' for its women, art and [[community activism]] issue.&lt;ref name=WE/&gt;

In 2008, the group did a collaborative work with the [[Guerrilla Girls]] at the [[Bronx Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name=BR/&gt; Elaine Kaufmann told ''[[Art News]],'' “I think what is really important was that we were ... coming after the Guerrilla Girls, and we were still seeing the same kind of gender discrimination happening in our generation and felt compelled to do something.”&lt;ref name=hoban/&gt;

Also in 2008, the group stationed themselves at the corner of West 24th Street and 10th Avenue in Chelsea, and got passers-by to fill in [[mad libs]]-style postcards protesting about the lack of female representation in art galleries.&lt;ref name=BR&gt;{{cite web|last=Fry|first=Warren|title=The Brainstormers|url=http://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/11/artseen/the-brainstormers|work=The Brooklyn Rail|accessdate=10 January 2014|date=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 they exhibited at the [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brainstormers Kindly Request That You Hand Over Your Balls|url=http://www.artfagcity.com/2009/07/30/brainstormers-kindly-request-that-you-hand-over-your-balls/|publisher=Art Fag City|accessdate=10 January 2014|date=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy and techniques===
The Brainstormers use similar tactics as the [[Guerrilla Girls]], such as [[Agitprop theatre]] and shocking statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schor|first=Mira|title=A Feminist Tea Party|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mira-schor/feminist-tea-party_b_821729.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=21 March 2014|date=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the group, the fault of institutional sexism does not lie with the institutions only: In 2006, they wrote,{{quote|text= "The responsibility for the perpetuation of this systemic form of discrimination falls on a rich network of dealers, curators, institutions, and even artists themselves. Each party denies any responsibility for bringing about change and instead tries to benefit from the status quo, their decisions guided by the bottom line."&lt;ref name=WE/&gt;}}
Of their work, Maria Dumlao has also said "Our work and actions are meant to inform, excite and provoke people in a dialogue. We encourage them to act on their own terms."{{sfn|McDonough, Yona Zeldis, “On Being Brainstormers,” ''NYFA Current,'' August 2009}}

[[File:Girl in chibi style.svg|thumb|right|Example for a character drawn in chibi style]]
{{nihongo|'''Chibi'''|ちび or チビ|}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] slang word describing something short (a thing, an animal or a person). It comes from the verb 禿びる (chibiru), which means "to wear out and become shorter" (for the tip of something).{{cn|date=March 2018}} The term is widely used in Japan to describe a specific style of [[caricature]] where characters are drawn in an exaggerated way. Typically these characters are small and chubby, with stubby limbs and oversized heads to make them resemble children. This style of artwork, also known as '''super deformed''', has since found its way into [[anime]] and [[manga]] fandom through its usage in manga works. "Chibi" can be translated as "little"(e.g. [[Chibi Maruko-chan]], which means Little Miss Maruko etc.), but is not used the same way as ''chiisana'' [小さな] / ''chiisai'' [小さい] (tiny, small, little in Japanese) but rather cute.{{cn|date=March 2018}} One example of the usage in Japanese which brought the term to the attention of Western fans is [[Chibiusa]], a [[hypocoristic|pet name]] for the [[:wiktionary:diminutive|diminutive]] daughter of [[Sailor Moon (character)|Sailor Moon]] formed from ''Chibi Usagi'' ("Little Rabbit").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurozuki.com/takeuchi/sailormoon/volume03.html |title=Sailor Moon volume 3 translation |accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proportions==
The head of a super deformed character is normally anywhere between one third&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bakaneko.com/howto/figure/chibi/index.html "A Super Deformed Tutorial"] on Bakaneko.com&lt;/ref&gt; and one half the character's height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polykarbon.com/tutorials/chibi/chibiart.htm|title=Action Tutorial|website=www.polykarbon.com|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their modified proportions, super deformed characters typically lack the detail of their normal counterparts. As a result, when a character of average proportions is depicted as a super deformed character, certain aspects of his or her design will be simplified and others will be exaggerated. Details such as folds on a jacket are ignored, and general shapes are favored. If a character has a signature characteristic (odd hair, a particular accessory, etc.) this will typically be prominent on the super deformed version of the character.&lt;ref&gt;''[[How to Draw Manga]] Volume 18: Super-Deformed Characters 1: Humans''.  {{ISBN|9784766114355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media usage==
The "chibi" art style is part of [[Japanese culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wowjapan.asia/2017/08/japanese-student-turns-philosophers-super-deformed-anime-style-characters/|title=Japanese student turns philosophers into super-deformed anime-style characters - WOWJAPAN|date=4 August 2017|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/185406/Clash_of_Clans_5_keys_to_success.php|title=Clash of Clans ' 5 keys to success|first=Mike|last=Rose|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smosh.com/smosh-pit/articles/why-japan-hands-down-coolest-country-planet|title=Why Japan Is Hands Down The Coolest Country On The Planet - SMOSH|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen everywhere from advertising and subway signs to [[anime]] and [[manga]].  The style was popularized by franchises like ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' and ''[[SD Gundam]]'' in the 1980s.{{cn|date=March 2018}} It is also used as [[comic relief]] in anime and manga, giving additional emphasis to a character's [[Emotion|emotional]] reaction.

The super deformed art style has also appeared in anime-influenced American series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A7142/datastream/OBJ/download/Applying_2D_Japanese_Super-Deformed_character_to_traditional_American_animation.pdf|title=Applying 2D Japanese Super-Deformed character to traditional American animation|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, such as ''[[Homestuck]]'', ''[[Teen Titans (TV Series)|Teen Titans]]'' or ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'''s Super Deformed shorts.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

'''Chick flick''' is a [[slang|slang term]] for the [[film genre]] dealing mainly with [[romance film|love and romance]] which is targeted to a female audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last= Simpson |editor-first=John |title= Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition, on CD-ROM Version 4.0 |publisher= Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn= 978-0-19-956383-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-last= Stevenson |editor1-first= Angus |editor2-last= Lindberg |editor2-first= Christine A. |year=2010 |title= New Oxford American Dictionary, Third Edition |location=New York |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=300 |isbn=978-0-19-539288-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be specifically defined as a genre in which a woman is the protagonist. Although many types of films may be directed toward the female gender, "chick flick" is typically used only in reference to films that contain emotion or themes that are relationship-based (although not necessarily romantic as films may focus on parent-child or friend relationships). Chick flicks often are released ''[[en masse]]'' around [[Valentine's Day]].&lt;ref name=suck/&gt;&lt;ref name=click/&gt; The equivalent for male audiences is the [[guy-cry film]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Feminists such as [[Gloria Steinem]] have objected to terms such as "chick flick" and the related term "[[chick lit]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2007/jul/13/chick|title=Chick flicks or prick flicks, they're just films|first=Jenny|last=Colgan|date=13 July 2007|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a film critic has called the term "chick flick" derogatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/06/entertainment/la-et-mg-safe-haven-premiere-julianne-hough-josh-duhamel-20130206|title='Safe Haven' premiere: Don't call it a 'chick flick,' please|first=Amy|last=Kaufman|date=6 February 2013|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Generally, a chick flick is a film designed to have an innate appeal to women, typically young women.&lt;ref name=click/&gt; Defining a chick flick is, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' has stated, more of a parlor game than a science.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |date= April 9, 2008 |accessdate= October 4, 2010 |publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]'' |title= Wary Hollywood Plans More Chick-Flicks (Hoping to Lure the Guys) |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/09/movies/09roma.html |first= Michael |last=Cieply }}&lt;/ref&gt; These films are generally held in [[popular culture]] as having formulaic, paint-by-numbers plot lines and characters. This makes usage of the term "problematic" for implying "frivolity, artlessness, and utter commercialism", according to [[ReelzChannel]].&lt;ref name=suck/&gt; However, several chick flicks have received high critical acclaim for their stories and performances. For example, the [[1983 in film|1983 film]] ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'' received [[Academy Awards]] for Best Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Actor in a Supporting Role.&lt;ref name=terms/&gt; More recently, the film ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'' (called a chick flick in some circles), featuring both [[Emma Stone]] and [[Ryan Gosling]], won Best Actress at the Academy Awards. Both of these actors were well known for their roles in chick flicks before jumping to the academy level.

Some frequent elements of chick flicks include having a female [[protagonist]],&lt;ref name=suck/&gt; thematic use of the [[Pink|color pink]] (along with [[Pink#In culture|metaphorical allusions of the color]]),&lt;ref name=click/&gt; and romance and/or dating-based storylines.&lt;ref name=twilight/&gt; Longtime producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] has remarked about the plots, "How do you cope with money and love?"&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Women are typically portrayed in chick flicks as sassy, noble victims, or klutzy twentysomethings.  Romantic comedies are considered a subgenre of the chick flick.  However, romantic comedies are typically respected more than chick flicks because they are designed to appeal to men and women.

Female [[MSN.com]] commentator Kim Morgan has written,
{{quote|[C]inema just wouldn't be the same without movies for and about women. And we don't just mean movies about pretty women, but all women and their issues&amp;nbsp;– something many guys don't usually have the patience for in real life. That's what sisters are for, right? Right... sisters or movies.&lt;ref name=morgan /&gt;}}

== History ==
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}
The term "chick flick" was not widely used until the 1980s and 1990s but is reported to have been coined by Brian Callaghan of Montreal, Canada in the mid-1970s while discussing movies with a friend in a schoolyard. It has its roots in the "[[Woman's film|women's pictures]]" of the early twentieth century, which portrays the woman as a victim and housewife, and later the ''[[film noir]]'' of the 1940s and early 1950s, which portrays the threat of sexualized women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chick Flicks: Contemporary Women at the Movies|last = Ferriss|first = Suzanne and Mallory Young|publisher = Routledge|year = 2008|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |title= The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory? Feminist? Or Both? |jstor= 20838769 |journal= Off Our Backs |date= 2007-01-01 |pages= 43–45 |volume= 37 |issue=1 |first= Natalia M. |last= Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Women &amp; Film: Both Sides of the Camera |last= Kaplan |first= E. Ann |publisher= Methuen, Inc. |year= 1983 |isbn= 0416317502 |location= New York |pages= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, many women who were in the workforce during [[World War II]] faced the transition back into the home. [[Brandon French]] notes that the women's films of the 1950s "shed light on a different cluster of issues and situations women faced in their transition from the forties to the sixties: romance, courtship, work, marriage, sex, motherhood, divorce, loneliness, adultery, alcoholism, widowhood, heroism, madness, and ambition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On The Verge of Revolt: Women in American Films of the Fifties |last= French |first= Brandon |publisher= Frederick Ungar Publishing Co. |year= 1978 |isbn= 0804422206 |location= New York |pages= xxii-xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1961 in film|1961 film]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'', commonly known as one of the "classic" films from the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|golden age of cinema]], is sometimes considered an early chick flick due to common elements such as dealing with [[loneliness]], obsessive [[materialism]], and happy endings.&lt;ref name=suck/&gt;&lt;ref name=stylecaster/&gt; Author [[Molly Haskell]] has suggested that chick flicks are very different from the women's films of the 1940s and 1950s in that they now "sing a different tune." She feels that they are "more defiant and upbeat, [[post-modern]] and [[post-feminist]]."{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In the U.S. in the [[1980s in film|1980s]], a succession of teenage drama pictures also labeled as chick flicks were released, many by director [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]. These often had a different and more realistic tone than previous chick flicks, with dramatic elements such as [[abortion]] and personal alienation being included.&lt;ref name=suck/&gt;

Several chick flicks have been patterned after the story of [[Cinderella]] and other [[fairy tale]]s (e.g. ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'', ''[[Ever After]]'', and ''[[Pretty Woman]]''), or even Shakespeare in the case of ''[[She's the Man]]'' and ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]''. In addition, a large number are adapted from popular novels (e.g. ''[[The Princess Diaries (film)|The Princess Diaries]]'', ''[[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]]'') and literary classics (e.g. ''[[Little Women (1994 film)|Little Women]]''). While most films that are considered chick flicks are lighthearted, some suspense films also fall under this category, such as ''[[What Lies Beneath]]''.

After the blockbuster success of the [[2008 in film|2008]] [[Drama film|drama]]/[[romance film]] ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'', Paul Dergarabedian of Media By Numbers remarked, "[t]he word 'chick flick' is going to have to be replaced by big box-office girl-power flick" and that "[t]he box-office clout of the female audience is just astounding, and it's been an underserved audience for way too long". He also said, "they have no trouble finding money for the things they're passionate about." According to [[Fandango.com]], more than 75% of ''Twilight''{{'s}} opening-weekend audience was female.&lt;ref name="twilight" /&gt;

== Response to the term ==
The term “chick flick” has generated several negative responses from the modern [[Feminist movement|feminist]] community. Most criticisms of the genre concentrate on the negative consequences that arise from gendering certain interests, in this case film. Author of ''The Chick Flick Paradox: Derogatory? Feminist? or Both?'', Natalia Thompson, states that chick flicks are “an attempt to lump together an entire gender’s interests into one genre.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the tailoring of interests may seem helpful and natural, many critics argue that unnecessary gendering can have negative consequences on many different social groups.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Gender Stereotypes And The Logic Of Social Relations|last = Rimashevskaia|first = Natal'ia|date = 2008|journal = Russian Social Science Review|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there is evidence from Russian social scientist Natal'ia Rimashevskaia that gender stereotypes further perpetuated by the media can lead to discrimination against women and limit their “human and intellectual potential.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More criticisms of the term arise from actual content of the films in the chick flick genre and how the content affects society's perception of women. Some say that chick flicks are [[Microaggressions|micro-aggressions]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = SAGE Reference - Encyclopedia of Human Services and Diversity |url= http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/encyclopedia-of-human-services-and-diversity|doi = 10.4135/9781483346663|first = Linwood|last = Cousins}}&lt;/ref&gt; Micro-aggressions are actions or exchanges that degrade a person based on his or her membership in a "race, gender, age, and ability."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Critique of the genre ==
Despite the genre's obvious success, some film critics take issue with the content most chick flicks have in common. Although the subcategories represent different plot lines, all five have several characteristics in common. Many chick flicks can have an "ironic, self-deprecating tone", claims film theorist Hilary Radner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Neo-Feminist Cinema: Girly Films, Chick Flicks, and Consumer Culture|last = Radner|first = Hilary|publisher = Routledge|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-415-87773-2|location = New York, New York|pages = 117–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tone is one of the defining characteristics of the genre, and many feel that it lacks substance compared to other genres.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Radner also goes on to say the genre is "incredibly heteronormative and white-washed."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These common characteristics of the genre can lead to criticism from minority groups and social justice activists.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; More issues with the genre emerge from the opinion that chick flicks play to every woman's "patriarchal unconscious."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Issues in Feminist Film Criticism|last = Erens|first = Patricia|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 1990|isbn = 0-253-31964-1|location = Bloomington|pages = 59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her article ''Structural Integrity, Historical Reversion, and the Post-9/11 Chick Flick'', Diane Negra focuses on several romantic comedies, deemed to be chick flicks, set in [[New York City]] after the [[September 11 attacks|attacks on September 11th, 2001.]] &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://ezp.slu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=fyh&amp;AN=31314272&amp;site=eds-live |title= Structural Integrity, Historical Reversion, and the Post-9/11 Chick Flick |last= Negra |first= Diane |date= 2008 |journal= Feminist Media Studies |doi= 10.1080/14680770701824902 |pmid= |access-date = December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that the films "centralize female subjectivity but more compellingly undertake political work to stabilize national identity post-9/11."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The political and social upheaval following the attacks led to a need for films that show the importance of protecting gender and family norms, or "ideological boundaries," as opposed to the emphasis on "survivalism" and "homeland security," used to protect national boundaries, seen in the action films at the time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Juxtaposed with the "politically innocent" genre of the pre-9/11 period, the films are rife with political undertones that are meant "to stabilize national identity post-9/11." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

While the plot of a chick flick is typically expected to be centered around a romantic conquest, Alison Winch ("We Can Have It All") writes about films she calls "girlfriend flicks."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://ezp.slu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=fyh&amp;AN=71115497&amp;site=eds-live|title = We Can Have It All|last = Winch|first = Alison|date = 2012|journal = Feminist Media Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These movies emphasize the relationships between friends instead of focusing on a love connection, and examples include ''[[Bride Wars]]'' and ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]''.

According to Winch, {{Quote|text = Girlfriend flicks often have savvy, “nervous,” female voice-overs mirroring typical romantic comedies, but addressing female spectators in their assumption of the mutual minefield of negotiating relationships, body, work, family, depression—issues prevalent in conduct, diet, and self-help books marketed specifically to women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;|sign = |source = }}

Winch also states that girlfriend flicks are meant to criticize "second wave feminism’s superficial understanding of female solidarity" by showing "conflict, pain, and betrayal acted out between women."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; By emphasizing the "complexities of women's relationships,"  the girlfriend flick breaks the mold for the usual chick flick and allows the genre to gain a bit of depth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The '''Chigi Altarpiece''' is an altarpiece by [[Perugino]], dating to around 1506-1507. It is named after its commissioner [[Agostino Chigi]], a Sienese banker, for the Chigi family chapel in the church of [[Sant'Agostino (Siena)|Sant'Agostino]] in [[Siena]], where it still hangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Vittoria Garibaldi, ''Perugino'', in ''Pittori del Rinascimento'', Scala, Florence, 2004 {{ISBN|888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most altarpieces by Perugino, it has two registers. The upper heavenly one shows Christ on the cross surrounded by a symmetrical arrangement of angels and [[cherubim]]. The lower earthly register shows eight lamenting saints connected to the commissioner, the church and the chapel - on the right are [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jerome]], for example. The deep landscape backgrounds shows hills and a clear sky. The work originally also had a [[predella]], which is now divided between the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].

'''''Children Playing Before a Statue of [[Hercules]]''''' is a [[2005 in literature|2005]] anthology of [[short stories]] edited by [[David Sedaris]].

Sedaris published this book in order to support [[826NYC]], a nonprofit writing and tutoring center in Brooklyn, New York. All of his proceeds, after permission expenses, from ''Children Playing Before a Statue of Hercules'' will benefit this organization designed to help students ages six to eighteen develop their writing skills through free writing workshops, publishing projects, and one-on-one help with homework and English-language learning. In the book's epilogue, [[Sarah Vowell]] describes [[826NYC]]'s work.

'''Charles Thomas "Chuck" Close''' (born July 5, 1940) is an American painter, artist and photographer who achieved fame as a [[photorealist]], through his massive-scale portraits.  Close often paints abstract portraits of himself and others, which hang in collections internationally. Close also creates photo portraits using a very large format camera. Even though a catastrophic spinal artery collapse in 1988 left him severely paralyzed, he has continued to paint and produce work that remains sought after by museums and collectors.

==Early life and education==
Chuck Close was born in [[Monroe, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chuck Close profile|publisher=Art in the Allen Center|url=http://www.cs.washington.edu/building/art/ChuckClose|accessdate=2007-08-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907154813/http://www.cs.washington.edu/building/art/ChuckClose/|archivedate=2007-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Leslie Durward Close, died when Chuck was eleven years old. His mother's name was Mildred Wagner Close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-chuck-close-13141|title=Oral history interview with Chuck Close|accessdate=December 9, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114113706/http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-chuck-close-13141|archivedate=January 14, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close suffered, as a child, from a neuromuscular condition that made it difficult to lift his feet and a bout with [[nephritis]] that kept him out of school for most of sixth grade. Even when in school, he did poorly due to his [[dyslexia]], which wasn't diagnosed at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hylton|first1=Wil S.|authorlink=Wil S. Hylton|title=The Mysterious Metamorphosis of Chuck Close|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/magazine/the-mysterious-metamorphosis-of-chuck-close.html|accessdate=July 14, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=July 13, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713212317/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/17/magazine/the-mysterious-metamorphosis-of-chuck-close.html|archivedate=July 13, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of his early works are very large portraits based on photographs, using  [[Photorealism]] or [[Hyperrealism (painting)|Hyperrealism]], of family and friends, often other artists. He suffers from [[prosopagnosia]] (face blindness), and has suggested that this condition is what first inspired him to do portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosaicartnow.com/2010/07/prosopagnosia-portraitist-chuck-close|title=Mosaic Art NOW: Prosopagnosia: Portraitist Chuck Close|publisher=mosaicartnow.com|accessdate=August 20, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821091200/http://www.mosaicartnow.com/2010/07/prosopagnosia-portraitist-chuck-close/|archivedate=August 21, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Phong Bui]] in ''[[The Brooklyn Rail]]'', Close describes an early encounter with a [[Jackson Pollock]] painting at the [[Seattle Art Museum]]: "I went to the Seattle Art Museum with my mother for the first time when I was 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/chuck-close-9251491#early-life|title=Chuck Close|author=|date=|website=Biography|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323000921/https://www.biography.com/people/chuck-close-9251491#early-life|archivedate=23 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; I saw this Jackson Pollock drip painting with aluminum paint, tar, gravel and all that stuff. I was absolutely outraged, disturbed. It was so far removed from what I thought art was. However, within 2 or 3 days, I was dripping paint all over my old paintings. In a way I've been chasing that experience ever since."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bui|first=Phong|title=In Conversation: Chuck Close with Phong Bui|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=June 2008|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2008/06/art/chuck-close-with-phong-bui|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120406132818/http://brooklynrail.org/2008/06/art/chuck-close-with-phong-bui|archivedate=2012-04-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Close attended [[Everett Community College]] in 1958–60.&lt;ref name="Chuck Close"&gt;[http://www.crownpoint.com/artists/100/biographical-summary Chuck Close] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023003134/http://www.crownpoint.com/artists/100/biographical-summary |date=2012-10-23 }} Crown Point Press, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; Local notable eccentric, author, activist and journalist [[John Patric]] was an early anti-establishment intellectual influence on him, and a role model for the iconoclastic and theatric artist's persona Close learned to project in subsequent years.&lt;ref name=close&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_98hkDCFoJ4C&amp;pg=PT38&amp;dq=%22John+Patric%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lWD-VOTNE9beoASQt4K4Aw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22John%20Patric%22&amp;f=false|title=Chuck Close: Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Close received his B.A. from the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]]. In 1961, he won a coveted scholarship to the Yale Summer School of Music and Art,&lt;ref name="Chuck Close"/&gt; and the following year entered the graduate degree program at [[Yale University]], where he received his [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] in 1964. Among Close's classmates at Yale were [[Brice Marden]], [[Vija Celmins]], [[Janet Fish]], [[Richard Serra]], [[Nancy Graves]], [[Jennifer Bartlett]], [[Robert Mangold]], and [[Sylvia Plimack Mangold]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

After Yale, he studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]] on a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] grant.&lt;ref name="guggenheim.org"&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Chuck%20Close&amp;page=1&amp;f=Name&amp;cr=1 Chuck Close] [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to the US, he worked as an art teacher at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|University of Massachusetts]]. Close came to New York City in 1967 and established himself in [[SoHo]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Throughout his career, Chuck Close has expanded his contribution to portraiture through the mastery of such varied drawing and painting techniques as ink, graphite, pastel, watercolor, conté crayon, finger painting, and stamp-pad ink on paper; printmaking techniques, such as Mezzotint, etching, woodcuts, linocuts, and silkscreens; as well as handmade paper collage, Polaroid photographs, Daguerreotypes, and Jacquard tapestries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blumandpoe.com/exhibitions/chuck-close#press Chuck Close, October 29 – December 22, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113024806/http://www.blumandpoe.com/exhibitions/chuck-close |date=January 13, 2012 }} [[Blum &amp; Poe]], Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; His early airbrush techniques inspired the development of the [[ink jet printer]].&lt;ref name="Lyle Rexer 2000"&gt;Lyle Rexer (March 12, 2000), [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/12/arts/art-architecture-chuck-close-rediscovers-the-art-in-an-old-method.html Chuck Close Rediscovers the Art in an Old Method] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307110324/http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/12/arts/art-architecture-chuck-close-rediscovers-the-art-in-an-old-method.html |date=2016-03-07 }} ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Close had been known for his skillful brushwork as a graduate student at Yale University. There, he emulated [[Willem de Kooning]] and seemed "destined to become a third-generation [[abstract expressionist]], although with a dash of Pop iconoclasm".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; After a period in which he experimented with [[Figurative art|figurative]] constructions, Close began a series of paintings derived from black-and-white photographs of a female nude, which he copied onto canvas and painted in color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/chuck-close-920 Chuck Close] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805032544/http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/chuck-close-920 |date=2012-08-05 }} [[Tate Modern]], London.&lt;/ref&gt; As he explained in a 2009 interview with Cleveland, Ohio's ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' newspaper, he made a choice in 1967 to make art hard for himself and force a personal artistic breakthrough by abandoning the paintbrush. "I threw away my tools", Close said. "I chose to do things I had no facility with. The choice not to do something is in a funny way more positive than the choice to do something. If you impose a limit to not do something you've done before, it will push you to where you've never gone before."&lt;ref&gt;Norman, M. [http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2009/09/contemporary_art_legend_chuck.html Contemporary Art Legend Chuck Close Talks About Painting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604015731/http://www.cleveland.com/arts/index.ssf/2009/09/contemporary_art_legend_chuck.html |date=2010-06-04 }}, The Plain Dealer, September 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; One photo of [[Philip Glass]] was included in his resulting black-and-white series in 1969, redone with watercolors in 1977, again redone with stamp pad and fingerprints in 1978,  and also done as gray handmade paper in 1982.

Working from a gridded photograph, he builds his images by applying one careful stroke after another in multi-colors or grayscale. He works methodically, starting his loose but regular grid from the left hand corner of the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/chuck_close_photographs/ Chuck Close: Photographs, 23 July – 4 September 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123213841/http://whitecube.com/exhibitions/chuck_close_photographs/ |date=23 January 2015 }} [[White Cube]], London.&lt;/ref&gt; His works are generally larger than life and highly focused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paceprints.com/artist/172 Chuck Close] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318050514/http://www.paceprints.com/artist/172 |date=2012-03-18 }} Pace Prints, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; "One demonstration of the way photography became assimilated into the art world is the success of photorealist painting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is also called super-realism or hyper-realism and painters like [[Richard Estes]], [[Denis Peterson]], [[Audrey Flack]], and Chuck Close often worked from photographic stills to create paintings that appeared to be photographs. The everyday nature of the subject matter of the paintings likewise worked to secure the painting as a realist object."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Graham: American Culture in the 1980s (Twentieth Century American Culture) Edinburgh University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Close suffers from [[prosopagnosia]], also known as face blindness, in which he is unable to recognize faces. By painting portraits, he is better able to recognize and remember faces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/july-dec10/close_07-06.html For Chuck Close, an Evolving Journey Through the Faces of Others] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121223236/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/july-dec10/close_07-06.html |date=2014-01-21 }} [[PBS Newshour]] July 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject, Close has said, "I was not conscious of making a decision to paint portraits because I have difficulty recognizing faces. That occurred to me twenty years after the fact when I looked at why I was still painting portraits, why that still had urgency for me. I began to realize that it has sustained me for so long because I have difficulty in recognizing faces."&lt;ref&gt;Yuskavage, Lisa. [http://bombsite.com/issues/52/articles/1868 "Chuck Close"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110818034248/http://bombsite.com/issues/52/articles/1868 |date=2011-08-18 }}, "[[BOMB Magazine]]", Summer, 1995. Retrieved July 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his later paintings differ in method from his earlier canvases, the preliminary process remains the same. To create his grid work copies of photos, Close puts a grid on the photo and on the canvas and copies cell by cell. Typically, each square within the grid is filled with roughly executed regions of color (usually consisting of painted rings on a contrasting background) which give the cell a perceived 'average' hue which makes sense from a distance. His first tools for this included an airbrush, rags, razor blade, and an eraser mounted on a power drill. His first picture with this method was ''Big Self Portrait'', a black and white enlargement of his face to a {{convert|107.5|x|83.5|in|cm}} canvas, made in over four months in 1968, and acquired by the [[Walker Art Center]] in 1969. He made seven more black and white portraits during this period. He has been quoted as saying that he used such diluted paint in the airbrush that all eight of the paintings were made with a single tube of [[Mars Black (pigment)|Mars Black]] acrylic.

His later work has branched into non-rectangular grids, [[topographic map]] style regions of similar colors, [[CMYK]] color grid work, and using larger grids to make the cell by cell nature of his work obvious even in small reproductions. The ''Big Self Portrait'' is so finely done that even a full page reproduction in an art book is still indistinguishable from a regular photograph.

==="The Event"===
On December 7, 1988, Close felt a strange pain in his chest. That day he was at a ceremony honoring local artists in New York City and was waiting to be called to the podium to present an award. Close delivered his speech and then made his way across the street to [[Beth Israel Medical Center]] where he suffered a seizure which left him paralyzed from the neck down. The cause was diagnosed as a spinal artery collapse.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hagan, Sean [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/oct/09/art Head Master] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204075534/https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/oct/09/art |date=2016-12-04 }}, The Observer, October 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He had also suffered from neuromuscular problems as a child.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Viveros-Faune (July 18, 2012), [http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-07-18/art/a-visit-with-art-world-hero-chuck-close/ A Visit With Art-World Hero Chuck Close] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901100912/http://www.villagevoice.com/2012-07-18/art/a-visit-with-art-world-hero-chuck-close/ |date=2012-09-01 }} ''[[Village Voice]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Close called that day "The Event". For months, Close was in rehab strengthening his muscles with physical therapy; he soon had slight movement in his arms and could walk, yet only for a few steps. He has relied on a wheelchair ever since. Close spoke candidly about the effect disability had on his life and work in the book ''[[Chronicles of Courage: Very Special Artists]]'' written by [[Jean Kennedy Smith]] and [[George Plimpton]] and published by [[Random House]].&lt;ref name="JKS book"&gt;[http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/The-Kennedy-Family/Jean-Kennedy-Smith.aspx Chronicles of Courage: Very Special Artists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110409165454/http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/The-Kennedy-Family/Jean-Kennedy-Smith.aspx |date=2011-04-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Close continued to paint with a brush strapped onto his wrist, creating large portraits in low-resolution grid squares created by an assistant.  Viewed from afar, these squares appear as a single, unified image which attempt photo-reality, albeit in pixelated form.  Although the paralysis restricted his ability to paint as meticulously as before, Close had, in a sense, placed artificial restrictions upon his hyperrealist approach well before the injury. That is, he adopted materials and techniques that did not lend themselves well to achieving a photorealistic effect. Small bits of irregular paper or inked fingerprints were used as media to achieve astoundingly realistic and interesting results. Close proved able to create his desired effects even with the most difficult of materials to control. Close has made a practice, over recent years, of representing artists who are similarly invested in portraiture, like [[Cecily Brown]], [[Kiki Smith]], [[Cindy Sherman]], and [[Zhang Huan]].&lt;ref&gt;Martha Schwendener (September 27, 2013), [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/nyregion/a-review-of-chuck-close-recent-works-at-guild-hall-museum.html Works in Conversation With Photography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019163944/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/nyregion/a-review-of-chuck-close-recent-works-at-guild-hall-museum.html |date=2017-10-19 }} ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prints===
Close has been a printmaker throughout his career, with most of his prints published by [[Pace Gallery|Pace Editions]], New York.&lt;ref name="Chuck Close"/&gt; He made his first serious foray into print making in 1972, when he moved himself and family to San Francisco to work on a [[mezzotint]] at Crown Point Press for a three-month residency. To accommodate him, Crown Point found the largest copper plate it could (36 inches wide) and purchased a new press, allowing Close to make a work that was 3 feet by 4 feet. In 1986 he went to Kyoto to work with Tadashi Toda, a highly respected woodblock printer.&lt;ref&gt;Scarlet Cheng (January 21, 2007), [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/21/entertainment/ca-close21 Proof is in the printing] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120820074051/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/21/entertainment/ca-close21 |date=2012-08-20 }} ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, curator [[Colin Westerbeck]] used a grant from the Lannan Foundation to bring Close together with Grant Romer, director of conservation at the [[George Eastman House]].&lt;ref name="Lyle Rexer 2000"/&gt; Ever since, the artist has also continued to explore difficult photographic processes such as [[daguerreotype]] in collaboration with [[Jerry Spagnoli]] and sophisticated modular/cell-based forms such as [[tapestry]].

In a 2014 interview with Terrie Sultan, Close said: "I've had two great collaborators in the God knows how many years I've been making prints. One was the late Joe Wilfer, who was called the 'prince of pulp' … and now I'm working with [[Donald Farnsworth|Don Farnsworth]] in Oakland at…[[Magnolia Editions]]: I do the watercolor prints with him, I do the tapestries with him.

==Exhibitions==
Close's first solo exhibition, held in 1967 at the [[University Museum of Contemporary Art|University of Massachusetts Art Gallery]], Amherst, featured paintings, painted reliefs, and drawings based on photographs of record covers and magazine illustrations. The exhibition captured the attention of the university administration which promptly closed it, citing the male nudity as obscene. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and the [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP) came to the defense of Close and a landmark court case ensued. A Massachusetts Supreme Court Justice decided in favor of the artist against the university. When the university appealed Close chose not to return to Boston, and ultimately the decision was overturned by an appeals court.&lt;ref name="pacegallery.com"&gt;[http://www.pacegallery.com/newyork/exhibitions/12653/nudes-1967-2014 Chuck Close: Nudes 1967–2014, February 28 – March 29, 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312015116/http://www.pacegallery.com/newyork/exhibitions/12653/nudes-1967-2014 |date=March 12, 2014 }} [[Pace Gallery]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; (Close was later awarded an Honorary Doctorate of the Arts by the University of Massachusetts in 1995.)&lt;ref name="pacegallery.com"/&gt;

The composition, a 15-minute piece for solo piano, was the idea of Bruce Levingston, a concert pianist, who commissioned it through the Premiere Commission and who performed the piece at a recital at [[Alice Tully Hall]] that year.&lt;ref&gt;Charles McGrath (April 22, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/22/arts/music/22glas.html A Portraitist Whose Canvas Is a Piano] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510171139/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/22/arts/music/22glas.html |date=2015-05-10 }} ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundraising and community service==

In 2007 Close was honored by the [[New York Stem Cell Foundation]] and donated artwork for an exclusive online auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NYSCF Exclusive Online Art Auction Now Closed|url=http://www.nyscf.org/events/past-events/item/713-nyscf-launches-exclusive-online-art-auction-now-chuck-close-christo-and-roy-lichtenstein|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123212212/http://www.nyscf.org/events/past-events/item/713-nyscf-launches-exclusive-online-art-auction-now-chuck-close-christo-and-roy-lichtenstein|archivedate=2015-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012 [[Magnolia Editions]] published two tapestry editions and three print editions by Close depicting President [[Barack Obama]]. The first tapestry was unveiled at the [[Mint Museum]] in [[North Carolina]] in honor of the [[Democratic National Convention]]. These tapestries and prints were sold as a fundraiser to support the Obama Victory Fund. A number of the works were signed by both Close and Obama. Close has previously sold work at auction to raise funds for the campaigns of [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.artinfo.com/artintheair/2012/09/10/you-can-buy-chuck-closes-tapestry-portrait-of-barack-obama-for-100000/ "You Can Buy Chuck Close's Tapestry Portrait of Barack Obama for $100,000"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213044816/http://blogs.artinfo.com/artintheair/2012/09/10/you-can-buy-chuck-closes-tapestry-portrait-of-barack-obama-for-100000/ |date=2013-12-13 }} artinfo.com.

Close was one of eight artists who volunteered in 2013 to participate in President Barack Obama's [[Turnaround Arts initiative]], which aims to improve low-performing schools by increasing student "engagement" through the arts. Close mentored 34 students in the sixth through eighth grades at Roosevelt School in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], one of eight schools in the nation to participate in this public-private partnership developed in cooperation with the U.S. [[Department of Education]] and the White House [[Domestic Policy Council]]. Close was honored by mayor Bill Finch with a key to the city at the November 7 reception at the [[Housatonic Community College]] Museum of Art, where five of Close's watercolor prints were exhibited alongside artwork by students participating in the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finch welcomes artist Chuck Close to Park City|url=http://www.thebridgeportnews.com/6993/finch-welcomes-artist-chuck-close-to-park-city/|work=The Bridgeport News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110150721/http://www.thebridgeportnews.com/6993/finch-welcomes-artist-chuck-close-to-park-city/|archivedate=2013-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colonial architecture''' is an architectural style from a mother country that has been incorporated into the buildings of settlements or colonies in distant locations. Colonists frequently built settlements that synthesized the architecture of their countries of origin with the design characteristics of their new lands, creating hybrid designs.&lt;ref name="ovaita"&gt;{{cite book |last=Guaita |first=Ovidio |year=1999 |title=On distant shores: colonial houses around the world |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BRUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=world+colonial+architecture&amp;dq=world+colonial+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=obfkUqKfFIqKiQfB2oFA&amp;redir_esc=y |location= |publisher=Monacelli Press |isbn=9781580930512 |accessdate=January 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2087">'''Columbia Artists Management, Inc.''' ('''CAMI''') is an international talent management [[talent agent|agency]].

==History==
Based in [[New York City]], it was formed in 1930 as Columbia Concerts Corporation by [[Arthur Judson]] and [[William S. Paley]], the then head of the [[Columbia Broadcasting System]], who helped merge seven independent concert bureaus in the United States.

During its existence, CAMI has represented a very large number of active classical artists worldwide, including singers [[Leontyne Price]], [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]], [[Renata Tebaldi]], [[Mario Lanza]], [[Jussi Björling]], [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]], [[Richard Tucker]], [[Paul Robeson]], and [[George London (bass-baritone)|George London]]; pianists [[Vladimir Horowitz]], [[Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli]], and [[Van Cliburn]]; violinists [[Jascha Heifetz]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], and [[Tossy Spivakovsky]]; and conductors [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Herbert von Karajan]], and [[Otto Klemperer]].

Composers [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Aaron Copland]] were managed by CAMI when they appeared as performers.

British music commentator [[Norman Lebrecht]] has criticized CAMI and Wilford for what Lebrecht deems to be overly pervasive influence of them on conductor salaries and limited time spent by music directors with orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2001/01/24/banorm24.xml Norman Lebrecht, "Could Silver Fox, the manager of maestros, be losing his grip?".

'''Darío Antonio Suro García-Godoy''' (June 13, 1917, [[La Vega (city)|La Vega]] – January 18, 1997, [[Santo Domingo]]) was an [[art critic]], [[diplomat]] and painter from the [[Dominican Republic]]. He was the nephew of painter [[Enrique García-Godoy]], his first art teacher. Along with [[Yoryi Morel]] and [[Jaime Colson]], he is considered one of the founders of the modernist school of Dominican painting.

==Family==
Born to Jaime Vicente Suro Sánchez (born in 1890, in Utuado, Puerto Rico) and Isabel Emilia García-Godoy Ceara (born in 1883 to [[:es:Federico García Godoy|Federico García Godoy]] and Rosa Ceara Giménez).&lt;ref name=Genealogy&gt;{{cite web|last=Espinal Hernández|first=Edwin Rafael|title=Federico García Godoy: 90 años después|url=http://www.idg.org.do/capsulas/marzo2014/marzo201415.htm|work=Cápsulas Genealógicas en Areíto|publisher=Instituto Dominicano de Genealogía|accessdate=13 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424124402/http://www.idg.org.do/capsulas/marzo2014/marzo201415.htm|archivedate=April 24, 2014 |location=Santo Domingo,&amp;nbsp;D.&amp;nbsp;N.|language=Spanish|date=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a brother, [[Rubén Suro|Rubén Antonio]] (1916-2006).&lt;ref name=Genealogy/&gt;

==Early career==
Early on, he became popular as an [[Impressionist]] [[landscape artist]], often painting horses and rainy scenes of the Cibao region of his country. Suro had his first solo exhibition in 1938 at the Ateneo Dominicano in Santo Domingo. Subsequently, the same exhibition was shown at the San Cristobal Ateneo and in 1939, he was included in group exhibitions in [[New York City]], at the Riverside Museum and the Dominican Republic Pavilion at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].

In 1940, Suro participated in the Inter-American Exhibition of the Caribbean organized by the [[Organization of American States]]. In that same year, he participated in a group show at the Ateneo Dominicano in Santo Domingo. In 1942, he had a solo exhibition at the [[Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (Santo Domingo)|Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes]] in Santo Domingo.

==Mexico==
[[File:Dario Suro 01.jpg|right|thumb|''Lluvia en el mercado'' (English:  ''Rain in the Market''), 1942 ([[Museo de Arte Moderno (Santo Domingo)|Museo de Arte Moderno]], [[Santo Domingo]])]]
The following year, 1943, he married Maruxa Franco Fernandez of Santiago and shortly after, they departed for Mexico where he was named [[cultural attaché]] at the [[List of diplomatic missions of the Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic Embassy]] in that country. On the way, they stayed in [[Havana]] for several weeks, where his bride's cousin, Tomas Hernandez Franco, was the Dominican [[Consul General]] to that city. Here he met with the young art critic [[José Gómez-Sicre]], whom he had encountered previously in Santo Domingo. Later they would renew their friendship in [[Washington, D.C.]], where Gómez-Sicre was the founder and director of the [[Art Museum of the Americas]], which was established in 1976 by the O.A.S. Permanent Council. While in Havana, Suro also met and befriended important modern artists such as [[Fidelio Ponce]], [[Carlos Enríquez]] and [[Amelia Peláez]].

===Art study===
Finally arriving in Mexico after their fascinating Cuban "sejour", Suro had a very busy schedule. In addition to his duties as attaché, he enrolled at [[Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado "La Esmeralda"]], where he studied art for nearly four years with some of the most prestigious artists in contemporary Mexico, including [[Diego Rivera]], [[Agustín Lazo]], [[Jesús Guerrero Galván]] and [[Manuel Rodríguez Lozano]].

Suro soon befriended some of the most prominent people in Mexico City, which was a great cultural center at the time, including the [[philosopher]] [[Alfonso Reyes]], the [[art historian]] and critic Justino Fernández, painters [[María Izquierdo (artist)|María Izquierdo]] and [[Angelina Beloff]] (the first wife of Rivera), and writer and critic Agustín Velázquez Chávez. He also met [[José Clemente Orozco]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Lupe Marin]] and [[José Vasconcelos]], who would play a crucial role in Suro's career. In 1944, he received word that he had won the Second Prize (Silver Medal) at the Second National Fine Arts Biennial in Santo Domingo. Two years later he won First Prize (Gold Medal) at the Third National Fine Arts Biennial.

===Impact on work===
Suro's time in Mexico had a dramatic impact on his work. Moving away from a harmonious palette and depictions of pleasant, often melancholy, genre scenes that made him popular with his countrymen, he opted for something more bold and jarring. Influenced by the Mexican nationalistic spirit that embraced all things ethnic, Suro created a related Dominican vision heretofore unseen, a new kind of painting called "Negroide", which had its counterpart in Dominican literature of the time, namely in the poetry of his brother Rubén Suro ("Poemas De Una Sola Intencion"). Directly addressing multiracial issues (an obvious component of Dominican reality) through graphic images, was indeed a new approach in a nation where whitewashing was often the norm. Many Dominicans liked to think that their heritage derived exclusively from Spain, forgetting their important African legacy. Suro's take was confrontational and challenging, using imagery that made some of his countrymen uncomfortable.

In 1946, he was included in a group show at the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in Mexico City. The following year, he had a solo exhibition at the institution, an event that was widely publicized in the city, bringing him recognition from some of the most important art critics{{spaced ndash}} but perhaps leading to his downfall with his own government. His embassy job was suddenly terminated. Before he knew it, he was on a plane with his family going back home where he would be facing an uncertain future. Suro was told by unofficial sources that Dominican Republic [[dictator]] [[Rafael Trujillo]] was not happy with the attention his cultural attaché had received in Mexico.

==Dominican Republic==
Upon his return to Santo Domingo, Suro and his wife were warmly greeted by family and friends, while others, especially some who were close to Trujillo, kept a certain distance. The fall from grace was short lived.

Vasconcelos, his friend from Mexico, who happened to arrive in Santo Domingo on an official visit and raved to Trujillo about the recently repatriated diplomat and painter, calling him "brilliant", and strongly urging the Dominican leader to name Suro Director of Fine Arts of the nation. This happened in early 1947 and once again Suro was celebrated. That same year, he had a successful solo exhibition at the [[National Palace of Fine Arts]] in Santo Domingo, showing works that were shown in Mexico with a few recent Dominican additions. Overall, Dominicans were greatly impressed by a new dynamic vision of their nation forged in Mexico by a young Dominican.

===Director of Fine Arts===
As Director of Fine Arts, Suro was once again in the spotlight, receiving distinguished guests, including [[Alicia Markova]] and [[Anton Dolin]] and groups like the celebrated "Coros y Danzas" from Spain. He was responsible for overseeing new exhibitions at the Palacio de Bellas Artes and setting up cultural programs. He also gave lectures covering a wide range of themes, like the one on his friend José Clemente Orozco, "La Muerte de Orozco", which he gave at the Instituto Dominico Americano in Santo Domingo. In 1948, he participated in the 4th National Biennial of Fine Arts.

===Personal issues===
During this same period, the Suro family underwent dramatic, painful changes. His son, Jaime, died suddenly shortly before his second birthday. This event became an obsessive recurring [[leitmotif]] in several of his paintings. Depicting the dead child becomes a kind of [[catharsis]] in those canvases; the native [[Baquiní]] ritual of burying children becomes an important point of identity for the artist. In 1948, his son Federico was born and the following year his daughter Rosa.

==Spain==
In 1950, Suro's life changed once again when he was sent to Spain as cultural attaché of the Dominican Republic. Arriving with his family in [[Madrid]], Suro befriended some of the most outstanding Spanish artists of that time, including [[Antonio Saura]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Manolo Millares]], and [[Jose Caballero]] ("Pepe"). Caballero was a close friend of [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Luis Buñuel]] and others. Suro was also able to see the great art of Spain, including works by his personal favorites [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[El Greco]] and [[Goya]].

Living in Spain also facilitated extensive travel to other European cities, including Paris, London and Amsterdam. He especially loved Italy, and was particularly impressed by the works of [[Piero della Francesca]].

Combining diplomacy and art as he had in Mexico, Suro participated in group exhibitions in Madrid and Barcelona, as well as faraway places like San Francisco ([[California Palace of the Legion of Honor|Legion of Honor]]) and Pittsburgh ([[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute]]). He was invited to participate in the [[Salón de los Once]] in 1951, along with ten other artists, a venue organized by the philosopher [[Eugeni d'Ors]]. The same year, he participated in the First Hispano-American Biennial, which was exhibited in Madrid and Barcelona. He represented the Dominican Republic in several important congresses (including the [[Congreso de la Cooperacion Intellectual Latino Americano—1952]]) while continuing his travels throughout the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and several other European nations.

In terms of his artistic development, Spain had a significant impact. This is where Suro painted his first abstract canvases, influenced by European trends.

==Dominican Republic==
As in Mexico, his busy professional life came to an abrupt end. His job was suddenly terminated, without any explanation. Upon arrival in Santo Domingo the same scenario was repeated that they experienced upon their return from Mexico. The Suros heard gossip about the termination of his job and a close friend, who happened to be related to Trujillo's wife, recommended that they leave the country. Leaving the country in that era was not simple. Both Dario and Maruxa were interrogated, but in a fairly short time they were on their way to New York City in 1953. Their children joined them the following year.

==New York City==
Suro's New York City experience would be decidedly different from his Mexico City and Madrid years. With limited English, the couple had a difficult time adjusting to the metropolis. His wife immediately found work as a seamstress in a factory. Suro, however had a harder time. Visiting several establishments that hired artists to do fairly routine work, he soon realized that there was little demand. He finally found a job on [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], in a factory where artists painted [[porcelain]], screens and other objects. They were given models to work from, with a limited freedom of artistic expression.

Nevertheless, Suro explored the New York City art scene. He started contacting dealers and gallery owners, including [[Rose Fried]], [[Betty Parsons]] and [[Leo Castelli]].

As an art critic, Suro wrote the first in-depth critical articles on both [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] in the Spanish language. He reintroduced the work of [[Joaquín Torres García]] to the artists within the [[Rose Fried Gallery]] circle, where he was asked to write the text of an accompanying monograph for Torres Garcia's 1960 breakthrough exhibition.

Among the artists befriended by Suro in New York City were [[Fritz Glarner]], [[Ronnie Elliott]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Adolf Fleischmann]], [[Minna Citron]], [[Bud Hopkins]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Charmion von Wiegand]], [[John Grillo]], [[Jean Xceron]], [[Judith Rothschild]], [[Lil Picard]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[Raymond Hendler]], [[John Hultberg]] and [[Lynne Drexler]].

In spite of his busy schedule, working in the factory and painting at home, he wrote for many international publications, including the Paris-based ''[[Aujourd'hui]]'' and the Madrid-based ''[[Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos]]'', and he was a frequent contributor at ''[[El Caribe]]'' and other newspapers in the Dominican Republic.

Through his job, he met [[Herman Somberg]], one of his coworkers who was a quintessential New Yorker and a talented artist who happened to be a close friend of [[Franz Kline]]. After a certain reluctance, the latter finally agreed to meet Suro and the two became fast friends (later Suro reminisced about the encounter and ensuing friendship in an article written for ''Americas Magazine'' "Franz Kline{{spaced ndash}} Freedom and Space" in 1969). He frequented the [[Cedar Tavern]] in Manhattan, which he later called "one of the great universities of my life" and the place where he drank seriously along with his growing number of acquaintances. Another special friend was [[Philip Guston]], who was fluent in Spanish.

===Neo-Plasticist world===
Many of the friends that he met early on through Fried were part of the [[Neo-Plasticist]] world. [[Fritz Glarner]] had been a close friend of Mondrian, a kindred spirit and the man who photographically documented Mondrian's New York City studio. One of Suro's most intriguing friends was the German Dadaist poet, writer and drummer [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] who was also a psychiatrist who went by the name Charles R. Hulbeck. As in Mexico and Spain, Suro changed his style once again, expressing himself through geometric abstract images and eventually going on to works that were decidedly informal and expressionistic.

===Group shows===
He participated in group shows at the Rose Fried Gallery, including the International Collage Exhibition in 1956. [[Barbara Guest]], covering this show for ''Arts Magazine'', observed, "Suro has carried the Dada idea along, with a frank assemblage of numbers which would have delighted le grand maitre Picabia". Suro also participated in many group shows, including the  "International Avant Garde Perspectives" at the [[Newport Art Association]] in 1959.

He finally had a solo exhibition at the [[Poindexter Gallery]], in Manhattan, in 1962. The new paintings were both a reflection of his American experience, as well as his lifelong obsession with Spain{{spaced ndash}} several paintings were entitled "Tauromaquia", Suro's homage to Goya. Unfortunately, the exhibition coincided with a major newspaper strike and Suro did not receive a normal press coverage. [[John Gruen]], in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', among the few periodicals that covered the event, wrote: "A Dominican artist who has shown extensively in Europe but not previously here offers oils and collages in intensely muted colors flavored with textual elements reminiscent of the Spanish concern with the "earth". They are strong, bold and terse". Suro received a congratulatory letter from his old friend [[Vela Zanetti]], who visited the exhibition and was both impressed and surprised by the new paintings. The art magazines had overall positive comments as well.

==Washington==
In 1961, events in his homeland once again changed his life. Trujillo was assassinated. [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]], Suro's childhood friend, was elected [[President of the Dominican Republic]] in 1962 and named Suro the cultural attaché at the [[Embassy of the Dominican Republic in Washington, D.C.]], as well as the Organization of American States (OAS). Suro remained in these posts for most of the rest of his life. Washington did not offer the same artistic stimulus as New York City, but his new job was more comfortable and better-paying.

Suro continued painting and exhibiting worldwide into his old age. His painting went through new phases, constantly changing. In his last decade, he revisited old themes, often combining them and coming up with something new in the process. He also continued writing, frequently contributing to ''Americas Magazine'', several Dominican Republic publications, including ''Ahora'' and ''Listin Diario'', as well as international ones, including ''[[Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos]]'' and ''[[Acento Cultural]]''. He was promoted from cultural attaché to Counselor (1965) to [[Minister-counselor|Minister Counselor]] (1967) to [[Minister Plenipotentiary]], [[Deputy Chief of Mission]] (1970) and finally Adjunct Ambassador, Alternate Representative (1980).

In October 1996, he returned to the Dominican Republic with his wife. He was hoping to concentrate on his art, developing new ideas for paintings inspired by shadows; however, he died the following January. His funeral was attended by many friends, as well as Dominican dignitaries; three former Dominican presidents were present{{spaced ndash}} [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]], [[Donald Reid Cabral]] and [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]]{{spaced ndash}} who told the Suro family "Dario Suro was not only a great artist, he was a great Dominican".

==Recognition==
Suro was the first artist to receive "El Premio Nacional de Artes Plasicas" of the Dominican Republic in 1993, which was presented to him by President [[Joaquín Balaguer]]. The "Orden de Duarte, Sanchez y Mella" medal was presented posthumously to his widow by President [[Leonel Fernández]] in 1999.

A comprehensive retrospective, "Dario Suro 1917&amp;ndash;1997: Metamorfosis y Transmigracones", was organized at the Centro Cultural de Espana in Santo Domingo, curated by Ricardo Ramon Jarnes, Laura Gil and Marianne de Tolentino in 2001. The 4th Caribbean Biennial (2002), dedicated to Suro, was organized by Sara Herman, Director of the National Gallery of Modern Art of the Dominican Republic; Ricardo Ramon Jarnes and Laura Gil curated an accompanying retrospective exhibition. President [[Hipólito Mejía]] and Vice President Milagro Ortiz Bosch opened this biennial.

===Self-assessment===
In 1981, Suro assessed his approach to art in the following manner: "I have always been motivated by the existential condition of an object and not by the development of a style." More recently, art historian and critic Alejandro Anreus, who often wrote about Suro, offered a more complete summary of his multifaceted career as follows. "Stylistically, Suro transformed the social realism of the Mexican muralists into a neo-realist aesthetic charged with an existential view of tragedy. By the 1950s he had already painted in a kind of pre-Pop Art when he completed his numeric series, and in the 1960s his abstract expressionist phase was a highly original one where the stain, more than the gesture, was his proffered mark-making strategy, while his palette was evocative of 17th century Spanish painting. His erotic period (1970s) culminated in an obsessive calligraphic use of thin, transparent layers of paint, where lines constructed the female sexual forms as pulsating, fully empowered entities with a life of their own. His body of work before his death was a fierce expressionism, where both the human and landscape forms were torn and reconstructed."

=== Racist chair controversy ===
In 2014, a photograph of Zhukova sitting on a chair designed as a mannequin of a black woman was featured on {{em|Buro 24/7}}, an online fashion publication. The photograph was widely criticized as racist. {{em|Buro 24/7}} cropped the chair from the photo and Zhukova apologised, describing the chair as artwork and as "commentary on gender and racial politics". Zhukova added, "I utterly abhor racism and would like to apologise to those offended by my participation in this shoot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chan|first1=Stephanie|title=Russian Fashion Editor Sits on a Black Person Posing as a Chair; Apologizes|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dasha-zhukova-sits-a-black-673059|accessdate=15 November 2014|issue=21 January 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216141032/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/dasha-zhukova-sits-a-black-673059|archivedate=16 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Julee|title=Garage Magazine Editor-In-Chief Dasha Zhukova Sits On A 'Black Woman' Chair In Shocking Editorial|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/20/dasha-zhukova-black-woman-chair-buro-247-editorial_n_4633544.html|accessdate=15 November 2014|work=Huffington Post|date=20 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113222523/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/20/dasha-zhukova-black-woman-chair-buro-247-editorial_n_4633544.html|archivedate=13 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saul|first1=Heather|title=Editor apologises after Dasha Zhukova 'black woman mannequin' chair sparks racism row|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/dasha-zhukova-black-woman-mannequin-chair-sparks-racism-row-9074915.html|accessdate=17 November 2014|work=The Independent|date=21 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129213716/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/dasha-zhukova-black-woman-mannequin-chair-sparks-racism-row-9074915.html|archivedate=29 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drusilla Dunjee Houston''' (née Drusilla Dunjee; January 20, 1876 - February 8, 1941) was an American writer, historian, educator, journalist, musician, and screenwriter from [[West Virginia]]. 

==Biography==
Drusilla Dunjee Houston, born January 20, 1876 in [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia]], was the daughter of Rev. [[John Dunjee|John]] and Lydia Ann (Taylor) Dunjee.&lt;ref name="okhistory.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="blackpast.org" /&gt; Her father was an alumnus of [[Storer College]], a preacher and teacher, working at what was then a [[normal school]] under the auspices of the Baptist Missionary Association. Drusilla was sent to finishing school in the North and studied [[classical piano]] at the Northwestern Conservatory of Music in [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref name="wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drusilla Dunjee Houston|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/drusilla-dunjee-houston-2/|publisher=Women Film Pioneers Project at Columbia University|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of her nine siblings, only Roscoe, Irving, Blanche, and Ella survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name="okhistory.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Houston, Drusilla Dunjee (1876–1941)|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entryname=DRUSILLA%20DUNJEE%20HOUSTON|publisher=Oklahoma History Center|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1892 the family moved to [[Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma Territory, where their father was assigned by the Baptists. From 1892 to 1898, Dunjee taught kindergarten and elementary school in Oklahoma City.

In 1899 she eloped with Price Houston. They settled in [[McAlester, Oklahoma]], in what was still [[Indian Territory]]. The state was admitted to the Union in 1908. There Houston founded McAlester Seminary for Girls, leading it for 12 years. She was hired by the Baptists in 1917 to serve as principal of the Oklahoma Baptist College for Girls, and moved to [[Sapulpa, Oklahoma]]. She served as principal for six years. 

When Houston returned to Oklahoma City after this, she started the Oklahoma Vocational Institute of Fine Arts and Crafts. After 1934 Houston served as religious director of the Oklahoma Home for Delinquent Boys.&lt;ref name="okhistory.org" /&gt; 

Her father had died in 1903, causing her mother and younger siblings to struggle financially; her younger brother, [[Roscoe Dunjee]], took on a good part of supporting them. First he expanded their family farm to produce vegetables and other produce for sale. Irving Dunjee left Oklahoma for Chicago and New York City, where he worked in journalism, becoming managing editor of the ''[[Chicago Enterprise]]'' and editor of ''[[The Negro Champion]]'', respectively in those two cities.  

In 1915 her brother Roscoe Dunjee had founded the ''Oklahoma [[Black Dispatch]]'', the first black newspaper in Oklahoma City or the state. Houston had joined him in writing for the newspaper even before she returned to the city, serving as a contributing editor and columnist.&lt;ref name="okhistory.org" /&gt; 

Houston became an independent historian. Beginning in 1901, she conducted research into a variety of sources and published a multi-volume history of Africans in their homeland, ''Wonderful Ethiopians of the Ancient Cushite Empire'' (1926).&lt;ref name="blackpast.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Houston, Drusilla Dunjee (1876-1941)|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aaw/houston-drusilla-dunjee-1876-1941|website=BlackPast.org|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the work is now dated, it was influential as part of an early 20th-century effort by African Americans in the United States to document their African ancestors as peoples with complex, ancient history and civilizations.

Houston was a co-founder of Oklahoma chapters of the [[YWCA]], the Red Cross, and the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]], all based in Oklahoma City. She was an early leader of the [[Oklahoma Federation of Colored Women's Clubs]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Oklahoma"&gt;{{cite web |title=Women's Club Movement |url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entryname=WOMEN%27S%20CLUB%20MOVEMENT |website=The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |accessdate=6 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, her brother Roscoe Dunjee led several NAACP chapters to come together to form a state organization. She was a co-founder of the Dogan Reading Room of Oklahoma and served as its president.&lt;ref name="okhistory.org" /&gt; 

She died of [[tuberculosis]] on February 8, 1941, in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. She had moved there for her health, as the dry climate was believed to benefit people with lung disease, and TB was incurable at the time.

'''Face of Canada''' is an [[art exhibition]] displaying paintings of notable Canadians. It was showcased on July 1, 2011 at [[Canada Place]] in [[Vancouver]], displaying over 100 [[Oil paint|oil]] [[Portrait painting|portraits]] of notable individuals, both past and present, that helped shape the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://vancouversun.com/life/food/Canadian+artist+open+Vancouver+Canada+exhibit+featuring+portraits+famous/5026251/story.html |title=Canadian artist to open Vancouver Canada Day exhibit featuring 100 portraits of famous Canadians |publisher=Vancouversun.com |date=2011-06-29 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist==
The concept was derived by Canadian artist, [[William Meire]]. Born in [[Vancouver]],  September 2, 1966, Meire traveled to 49 countries studying art.&lt;ref name="gallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://williammeiregallery.com/ |title=William Meire Art Gallery |publisher=Williammeiregallery.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painting [[Impressionism|impressionist]] landscapes professionally, in an array of mediums over the past 10 years, Meire turned his interest to portraiture work in oil. After seeing [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Team Canada]] win the men's [[hockey]] in the [[2010 Olympic Games]] and feeling a sense of national pride, he started the 'Great Canadians,' a small series which eventually led to the Face of Canada.&lt;ref name="gallery"/&gt; After much research, Meire realized the great number of notable Canadians who have shaped and changed the nation, and affected many lives. On July 1, 2011, crowds came to see the one-day solo exhibition of over 100 oil portraits at Canada Place, which has now become part of Canada's national heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theprovince.com/entertainment/Face+Canada+exhibit+draws+Canada+crowds/5036685/story.html |title=Story - Entertainment |publisher=The Province |date= |accessdate=2011-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912122824/http://www.theprovince.com/entertainment/Face+Canada+exhibit+draws+Canada+crowds/5036685/story.html |archivedate=2011-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federal Writers' Project''' ('''FWP''') was a United States federal government project created to provide jobs for out-of-work writers during the [[Great Depression]]. It was part of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA), a [[New Deal]] program. It was one of a group of New Deal arts programs known collectively as [[Federal Project Number One]].

==Background==
[[File:Moments-with-Genius-Poster.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Poster for the Illinois Writers Project radio series ''Moments with Genius'', presented by the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] (c. 1939)]]
Funded under the [[Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935]], the Federal Writers' Project was established July 27, 1935, by President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]].  [[Henry Alsberg]], a journalist, playwright, theatrical producer, and human rights activist, directed the program from 1935-1939. In 1939 Alsberg was fired, federal funding was cut, and the Project fell under state sponsorship, led by John D. Newsom, until the FWP ended completely in 1943.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Henry Alsberg: The Driving Force of the New Deal's Federal Writer's Project.|last=Rubenstein DeMasi|first=Susan|publisher=McFarland and Co.|year=2016|isbn=978-1-4766-2601-7|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FWP produced thousands of publications over its existence including state guides, city guides, local histories, oral histories, ethnographies, children's books, and other works. In addition to writers, the Project provided jobs to unemployed librarians, clerks, researchers, editors, historians, and others. It's been estimated that over ten-thousand people found employment in the FWP.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The Federal Writers' Project set out not only to provide work relief for unemployed writers, but to create a unique "self-portrait of America" through publication of guidebooks.

== American Guide Series and other publications ==
''[[American Guide Series|The American Guide series]],'' the most well-known of the FWP's publications, consisted of guides to the then 48 states, as well as [[Alaska Territory|the Alaska Territory]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] The books were written and compiled by writers from individual states and territories, and edited by Alsberg and his staff in Washington, D.C. The format was generally uniform, and each guide included detailed histories of the state or territory, with descriptions of every city and town, automobile travel routes, photographs, maps, and chapters on natural resources, culture,  and geography. The inclusion of essays about the various cultures of people living in the states, including immigrants and African Americans, was unprecedented. City books, such as ''The New York City Guide'', were also published as part of the series. Some full-length books are available online at the [https://archive.org/search.php?query=WPA%20Federal%20Writers%27%20Project Internet Archive].  The FWP also published another series, ''Life In America'', as well as numerous individual titles.  Many FWP books were bestsellers. Others, like ''Cape Cod Pilot'', written by author Josef Berger using the pseudonym Jeremiah Digges, received critical acclaim.

In each state a Writers' Project non-relief staff of editors was formed, along with a much larger group of field workers drawn from local unemployment rolls. The people hired came from a variety of backgrounds, ranging from former newspaper workers to white-collar and blue-collar workers without writing or editing experience.

[[Image:George Dillard 85 former slave.jpg|right|thumb|260px|George Dillard's oral history was recorded for the [[Slave Narrative Collection]] by the Federal Writers' Project (1936)]]

== Ancillary projects ==
Notable projects of the Federal Writers' Project included the [[Slave Narrative Collection]], a set of interviews that culminated in over 2,300 first-person accounts of slavery and 500 black-and-white photographs of former slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/snhtml/ Born in Slavery: Slave Narratives from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936-1938]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these narratives are available online from the above-named collection at the Library of Congress website. Folklorist [[Benjamin A. Botkin]] was instrumental in insuring the survival of these manuscripts. Among the researchers and authors who have used this collection are [https://www.colsonwhitehead.com Colson Whitehead] for his Pulitzer-Prize winning novel, ''The Underground Railroad''.

Other programs that emerged from Alsberg's desire to create an inclusive "self-portrait of America" were the Life History and Folklore Projects. These consisted of first-person narratives and interviews (collected and conducted by FWP workers) which represented people of various ethnicites, regions and occupations. According to the Library Congress website, [https://www.loc.gov/collections/federal-writers-project/about-this-collection/ American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936 to 1940], the documents "chronicle vivid life stories of Americans who lived at the turn of the century and include tales of meeting Billy the Kid, surviving the 1871 Chicago fire, pioneer journeys out West, grueling factory work, and the immigrant experience. Writers hired by this Depression-era work project included Ralph Ellison, Nelson Algren, May Swenson, and many others."

The Illinois Writers' Project, represented one of the few racially integrated Project sites. The [[Chicago]] project employed [[Arna Bontemps]], an established voice of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], and helped to launch the literary careers of African American writers such as [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Margaret Walker]], [[Katherine Dunham]], and [[Frank Yerby]] (Mangione 1972). The Virginia Negro Studies Project employed 16 African American writers and culminated in the publication of ''The Negro in Virginia (1940).'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/guides/opac/wpalhabout.htm|title=Library of Virginia, About the WPA Life Histories Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, it included photographs by Robert McNeill, now remembered as a groundbreaking African American photographer. The unpublished works of African American writer Zora Neale Hurston, who was employed by the Florida Writers' Project, was compiled years after her death in ''Go Gator and Muddy the Water: Writings by Zora Neale Hurston from the Federal Writers' Project''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Go Gator and Muddy the Water: Writings by Zora Neale Hurston from the Federal Writers' Project|last=Bordelon|first=Pamela|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=1999|isbn=978-0-393-31813-5|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
For most of its lifetime, the Federal Writers' Project faced a barrage of criticism from conservatives. When ''Massachusetts: A Guide to Its Places and People'', was published, it was lauded by government officials, including Governor Charles Hurley. But the day after its publication, "conservatives attacked the book over its essays on the [[1912 Lawrence textile strike]] and other labor issues. Even more sacrilegious to these critics was the coverage of the [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] affair."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Scholars called the questionable passages "fair accounts;"  ironically, the controversy helped increase book sales.

The most poisonous attacks against the FWP came from the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (commonly known as HUAC) and its chair, the media-savvy Congressman [[Martin Dies Jr.]] of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mangione|first=Jerre|title=The Dream and the Deal: the Federal Writers’ Project, 1935-1943|year=1996|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse|isbn=9780815604150|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alsberg and [[Hallie Flanagan]], his counterpart at the [[Federal Theatre Project]], faced tremendous scrutiny from the committee. The Dies HUAC committee, like the McCarthy committee of the 1950s, "used inquisitorial scare tactics, innuendo, and unsupported accusations."  Alsberg, Flanagan and others who were accused of supporting the communist agenda could not  "examine evidence against them, could not produce their own witnesses, could not cross-examine accusers."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Accusations that communist activities were carried out openly, and that Soviets funded labor unions which then took control of the arts' projects, were found to be false. Future Guggenheim scholar and author Richard Wright was often under attack, with his writings pronounced as "vile." (Rubenstein, p.&amp;nbsp;202.) Among the many charges leveled against the FWP and its members, was that Richard Wright was not born in the United States. (He was born in Mississippi.) Alsberg wrote a long court brief and provided supporting documents to refute each charge.

]]

Support for the FWP came from Eleanor Roosevelt, as well as mainstream publishing companies such as Viking Press, Random House, and Alfred Knopf, which produced some of the books. Americans continued to purchase ''American Guide'' books throughout this period. By 1939, HUAC's tactics seemed to work, and the newly elected Congress cut $150,000 million from WPA budget while quadrupling HUAC's funding. In January 1939, 6,000 people were laid off from Federal One. By July 1939, Congress voted to eliminate the Theatre Project. Federal sponsorship for the Federal Writers' Project came to an end in 1939, although the program was permitted to continue under state sponsorship, with some federal employees, until 1943. In the last months of the FWP's existence, Henry Alsberg was fired. He continued to work past his firing date in order to meet contractual arrangements with the publishers of three upcoming ''American Guide'' books. By the time of his departure in 1939, the FWP had published 321 publications; hundreds more remained in various stages of publications. Some were published in the years leading up to 1943 under the renamed Writer's Program. Others were never completed. Over the lifetime of the FWP and the Writer's Program, it is estimated that 10,000 people were employed. (Rubenstein, p.&amp;nbsp;221.)

==Film==
A [[National Endowment for the Humanities]]-funded documentary about the Federal Writers' Project, entitled ''Soul of a People: Writing America's Story'' premiered on the [[Smithsonian Channel]] in September 2009. The film includes interviews with notable American authors Studs Terkel, [[Stetson Kennedy]], and popular American historian [[Douglas Brinkley]]. The companion book was published by Wiley &amp; Sons as ''Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America''.

The Slave Narratives are represented by the HBO documentary, ''[[Unchained Memories|Unchained Memories: Readings from the Slave Narratives]]''. This program features well-known actors such as Angela Bassett and Samuel L. Jackson performing dramatic readings of the transcripts.

The 1999 film ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'', by Tim Robbins, while depicting the events of the Federal Theatre Project (FTP), dramatizes the attacks against Federal One (via the House Committee on Un-American Activities) which helped shutter both the FTP and the FWP.

The following glossary of words and terms (generally of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] origin) are related to '''[[owarai]]''' (Japanese comedy).  Many of these terms may be used in areas of [[Japanese culture]] beyond comedy, including [[television]] and [[radio]], [[music]]. Some have been incorporated into normal Japanese speech. __NOTOC__

==Glossary==

===bangumi===
:番組 (''bangumi'').  The Japanese word for [[television show]].

===boke===
:* Other Japanese meanings of [[Anglicisation|Anglicised]] spelling "boke":  [[Bokeh|'''Boke or bokeh'''&amp;mdash;blur in photography]], and, '''[[Japanese quince|'''Boke&amp;mdash;flowering Japanese quince]].'''  
:* For non-Japanese "boke,"'' see '''[[Boke (disambiguation)|Boke]]'''.

:ボケ (''boke''　{{IPA-ja|boke|}}).  From the verb bokeru 惚ける  or　呆ける, which carries the meaning of "senility" or "air headed-ness," and is reflected in this performer's tendency for misinterpretation and forgetfulness. '''The ''boke''''' is the "simple-minded" member of an [[#owarai|owarai]] [[#kombi|kombi]] (''[[manzai#Boke and tsukkomi|"tsukkomi and boke"]], or vice versa'') that receives most of the verbal and physical abuse from the "smart" [[#tsukkomi|tsukkomi]]  because of the boke's misunderstandings and slip-ups. '''The ''tsukkomi''''' (突っ込み) refers to the role the second comedian plays in ''"butting in"'' and correcting the boke's errors. It is common for tsukkomi to berate boke and hit them on the head with a swift smack; traditionally, tsukkomi often carried a fan as a multi-purpose prop, one of the uses for which was to hit the boke with.   ''Boke and tsukkomi'' are loosely equivalent to the roles of "funny man" or "comic" ''(boke)'' and "straight man" ''(tsukkomi)'' in the [[double act|comedy duos]] of western culture. Outside of owarai, boke is sometimes used in common speech as an insult, similar to "idiot" in English, or [[Baka (fool)|baka]] in Japanese.

===conte===
:コント (''konto''). From the [[French language|French]] word ''conte'', ''konto'' refers to the style of [[#manzai|manzai]] or [[owarai]] performance focusing on telling interesting tales, many of which, one must assume, are made up for the sake of humour. Also often called ''[[#manzai|manzai]] konto'' (漫才コント). Short conte (ショートコント) are skits often less than 30 seconds long where the comedians act out some sort of odd encounter or conversation.

===corner===
:コーナー (''kōnā''). Rarely taking the literal English meaning of the word "corner" as in "street corner" or "corner of a shape", this word is usually used in Japanese to mean "segment", as in "television segment".

===[[dajare]]===
:ダジャレ (''dajare''). A type of Japanese [[pun]] or [[word play]] in which the similarities in sound of two different words or phrases are used in a joke.

===dokkiri===
:ドッキリ (''dokkiri''). Recently popularized in the west by shows such as [[Punk'd]], these hidden-camera surprise pranks have been very common on Japanese television since the 90s. Traps such as pitfalls, falling objects, and seductive idols are often used.

===gag===
:ギャグ (''gyagu''). The same as the English word ''gag'', ''gyagu'' are generally cheap jokes (though the word often describes any joke) employed by a [[#geinin|geinin]] in their act. ''Gyagu'' tend to be short, physical, and often predictable.  American English speakers might say "a corny joke".

===geinin===
:芸人 (''geinin''). ''Gei'' means "performance" or "accomplishment", and the word ''geinin'' is often translated as "artisan". The un-abbreviated form of the word is 芸能人 (''geinōjin''), which means "performer" or "entertainer", but it is usually used in a context similar to the English "celebrity". Japanese comedians are usually called お笑い芸人 (''owarai geinin'', comedy performers) or お笑いタレント (''owarai tarento'', comedy talents) and talents that appear on television [[variety show]]s are usually called 芸能人タレント (''geinōjin tarento'', performing talents) or sometimes 若手芸人 (''wakate geinin'', young/newcomer talents) for newer additions to the talent pool. A ピン芸人 (''pin geinin'') is a solo stand-up performer.

===kire===
:キレ or 切れ (''kire''). A casual word for "anger" (similar to "pissed" or "ticked"), the キレ役 (''kireyaku'') is a role sometimes taken by [[#owarai|owarai]] [[#geinin|geinin]] who have very short tempers, or pretend to. [[Cunning (Owarai)|Cunning's]] [[Takanori Takeyama|Takeyama]] is well known for his short temper; his ''kire'' is his defining feature. Also, 逆ギレ (''gyaku gire'') is the act of getting angry at someone/something in reverse. For example: A girl cheats on her boyfriend, but then gets angry at her boyfriend when he finds out, insisting that it was his fault; a man trips on a rock while walking and swears at the rock, throwing it into the woods. This is a very common role in [[#owarai|owarai]] and [[#manzai|manzai]] performances.

===kombi===
:コンビ (''kombi''). An abbreviation of the English word "combination". Usually refers to the "combination" of two Japanese [[#owarai|owarai]] talents to form a comedy unit.

===konto===
:コント (''konto''). See [[#conte|conte]].

===Lumine===
:ルミネ (''rumine''). Short for "Lumine the Yoshimoto" (ルミネtheよしもと), ルミネ is a stage (劇場, ''gekijō'') in [[Shinjuku]]'s LUMINE2 building, exclusively for [[#owarai|owarai]] performances. It has considerable prestige as only the best performers in Japan ever get a chance to appear on this stage in front of a mere 500 live spectators.

===[[manzai]]===
:万歳, 万才, or (currently) 漫才 (''manzai''). A more traditional style of Japanese comedy.

===monomane===
:モノマネ or 物真似 (''monomane''). Usually impressions of other famous Japanese people, ''monomane'' is very common in Japan and some talents have even made a career out of their ''monomane'' skills. Some [[#geinin|geinin]] famous for their ''monomane'' are Korokke, Hori and [[Tomomitsu Yamaguchi|Gu-ssan]].

===[[owarai]]===
:お笑い (''owarai''). A general term for modern Japanese comedy.

===neta===
:ネタ (''neta''). Reverse spelling of the word ''tane'' (種), meaning "seed" or "pit". A ''neta'' is the background pretense of a konto skit, though it is sometimes used to refer to the contents of a segment of an [[#owarai|owarai]] act, a variety show, or a [[news]] broadcast. [[Warai Meshi]] almost won the 2004 M-1 Gran Prix by doing several acts on a neta about the somewhat poorly built human models in the Asuka Historical Museum in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. The neta of variety shows hosted by [[London Boots Ichigo Nigo]] almost always have to do with cheating girlfriends and boyfriends. See also [[#shimoneta|shimoneta]].

===pin geinin===
:ピン芸人 (''pin geinin''). See [[#geinin|geinin]].

===shimoneta===
:下ネタ (''shimoneta''). ''Shimoneta'' is the combination of the characters ''shimo'', meaning "low" or "down", and [[#neta|neta]]. A ''shimoneta'' is a dirty joke, usually focusing on sexual or revolting topics. Some [[#geinin|geinin]] are famous for their ''shimoneta''. For example, [[Takeshi Kitano|Beat Takeshi]] with his [[Nadia Comăneci|Comaneci]] gag, where the hands are thrust diagonally like the bottoms of a [[Gymnastics|gymnast's]] one-piece. Another equally well known comedian is Shimura Ken, who uses the character 'Henna Oji-san' to prowl amidst nubile girls.

===sur===
:シュール (''shūru''). From the [[French language|French]] word [[surrealism|surréalisme]], ''sur'' (sometimes [[romanization|romanized]] ''shule'') is comedy with no apparent reason or logic to it.  ''Sur'' itself is not very common, or popular, though many Japanese comedians are known to try out ''sur'' on occasion in their acts. ''Sur'' exploits the natural, uncomfortable feeling that occurs when people are confused and don't know how they are supposed to react to a meaningless or unexpected joke or comment, and so they just laugh. ''Sur'' may be compared to some of the unusual humor of the late [[United States|America]]n comedian [[Andy Kaufman]]. Strictly ''sur'' [[#kombi|kombi]] do exist, but it is extremely hard for ''sur'' performers to become popular.

===tsukkomi===
:突っ込み (''tsukkomi''). From the verb ''tsukkomu'' (突っ込む), meaning something like "butt in", this is often the role of the partner to the [[#boke|boke]] in an [[#owarai|owarai]] [[#kombi|kombi]]. The ''tsukkomi'' is generally the smarter and more reasonable of the unit, and will criticize, verbally and physically abuse, and generally rail at the ''boke'' for their mistakes and exaggerations. A typical ''tsukkomi'' often slaps the ''boke'' on the back of the head, an action always accompanied by an intentionally cheesy slapping [[sound effect]]. It is common for tsukkomi in [[#manzai|manzai]] to end an act with the phrase, "Let's quit!" (やめさしてもらいますわ！''Yamesashite moraimasu wa''!). The American equivalent is known as the [[Straight man (stock character)|straight man]].

===unchiku===
:うんちく or 蘊蓄 (''unchiku''). Literally a person's "stock of accumulated knowledge", ''unchiku'' usually refers to the act of complaining about something while teaching a lesson to an often uninterested audience. [[Cream Stew (comedy duo)|Cream Stew]] is known for ''unchiku''.

===ureteru===
:売れてる (''ureteru''). From the verb ''uru'' (売る), literally meaning "to sell", ''ureteru'' is often used in conversation referring to a performer's ability to sell their act (or themselves), and gives a little insight into the way many Japanese comedians think. An ''ureteru'' performer gets many more variety appearances, commercials, and pay from their agency than an ''uretenai'' (unable to sell) performer, and many performers determined to succeed will stop at almost nothing to promote themselves, and get "selling".

===variety bangumi===
:バラエティ番組 (''baraeti bangumi''). Though similar to the concept of [[variety show]] in English, shows in Japan often venture far from the  Western concept. [[Waratte Iitomo!]] and [[Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!|Gaki no Tsukai]] are among the longest running TV variety shows still on air today.

{{Japanese name|Hakuin}}
{{Nihongo|'''Hakuin Ekaku'''|白隠 慧鶴||extra=January 19, 1686 - January 18, 1768}} was one of the most influential figures in [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]]. He is regarded as the reviver of the [[Rinzai school]] from a moribund period of stagnation, refocusing it on its traditionally rigorous training methods integrating [[meditation]] and [[koan]] practice.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Hakuin was born in 1686 in the small village of [[Hara-juku (Tōkaidō)|Hara]],&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://nippon-kichi.jp/article_list.do?ml_lang=en&amp;p=2082 Shoinji Temple]&lt;/ref&gt; at the foot of [[Mount Fuji]]. His mother was a devout [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren Buddhist]], and it is likely that her piety was a major influence on his decision to become a Buddhist [[monk]]. As a child, Hakuin attended a lecture by a Nichiren monk on the topic of the [[Eight Hot Hells]]. This deeply impressed the young Hakuin, and he developed a pressing fear of [[hell]], seeking a way to escape it. He eventually came to the conclusion that it would be necessary to become a monk.

====Shōin-ji and Daishō-ji====
At the age of fifteen, he obtained consent from his parents to join the monastic life, and was ordained at the local Zen temple, [[Shōin-ji]]. When the head monk at Shōin-ji took ill, Hakuin was sent to a neighboring temple, Daishō-ji, where he served as a novice for three or four years, studying Buddhist texts. While at Daisho-ji, he read the [[Lotus Sutra]], considered by the Nichiren sect to be the king of all Buddhist sutras, and found it disappointing, saying "it consisted of nothing more than simple tales about [[causality|cause and effect]]".

====Zensō-ji====
At age eighteen, he left Daishō-ji for Zensō-ji, a temple close to Hara.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xv}} At the age of nineteen, he came across in his studies the story of the [[China|Chinese]] [[Ch'an]] master [[Yantou Quanhuo]], who had been brutally murdered by bandits. Hakuin despaired over this story, as it showed that even a great monk could not be saved from a bloody death in this life. How then could he, just a simple monk, hope to be saved from the tortures of hell in the next life? He gave up his goal of becoming an enlightened monk, and not wanting to return home in shame, traveled around studying literature and poetry.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xvi}}

====Zuiun-ji====
Travelling with twelve other monks, Hakuin made his way to Zuiun-ji, the residence of Baō Rōjin, a respected scholar but also a tough-minded teacher.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xvii}} While studying with the poet-monk Bao, he had an experience that put him back along the path of monasticism. He saw a number of books piled out in the temple courtyard, books from every school of Buddhism. Struck by the sight of all these volumes of literature, Hakuin prayed to the gods of the [[Dharma]] to help him choose a path. He then reached out and took a book; it was a collection of Zen stories from the [[Ming Dynasty]]. Inspired by this, he repented and dedicated himself to the practice of Zen.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xviii-xix}}

===First awakening===

====Eigen-ji====
He again went traveling for two years, settling down at the Eigen-ji temple when he was twenty-three. It was here that Hakuin had his first entrance into [[Kensho|enlightenment]] when he was twenty-four.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xvii}} He locked himself away in a shrine in the temple for seven days, and eventually reached an intense awakening upon hearing the ringing of the temple bell. However, his master refused to acknowledge this enlightenment, and Hakuin left the temple.
[[File:Hakuin.jpg|left|thumb|Hakuin Ekaku]]

====Shōju Rōjin====
Hakuin left again, to study for a mere eight months with Shōju Rōjin (Dokyu Etan, 1642–1721).{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxi-xxii}} Shoju was an intensely demanding teacher, who hurled insults and blows at Hakuin, in an attempt to free him from his limited understanding and self-centeredness. When asked why he had become a monk, Hakuin said that it was out of terror to fall into hell, to which Shōju replied "You're a self-centered rascal, aren't you!"{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxii}} Shōju assigned him a series of "hard-to-pass" koans. These led to three isolated moments of [[satori]], but it was only eighteen years later that Hakuin really understood what Shōju meant with this.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxii}}

Hakuin left Shoju after eight months of study,{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxii-xxiii}} without receiving formal dharma transmission from Shoju Rojin,{{sfn|Mohr|2003|p=311-312}} nor from any other teacher,&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/2009/02/teaching-credentials-in-zen.html James Ford (2009), ''Teaching Credentials in Zen'']&lt;/ref&gt; but Hakuin considered himself to be an heir of Shoju Rojin. Today Hakuin is considered to have received [[dharma transmission]] from Shoju.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.buddhapia.com/hmu/bcm/2/zen_soto_rinzai.html Zen Buddhism: from perspective of Japanese Soto &amp; Rinzai Zen Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717040105/http://www.buddhapia.com/hmu/bcm/2/zen_soto_rinzai.html |date=2012-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Taigi'' - great doubt====
Hakuin realized that his attainment was incomplete.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxv}} He was unable to sustain the tranquility of mind of the Zen hall in the midst of daily life.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxv}} When he was twenty-six he read that "all wise men and eminent priests who lack the Bodhi-mind fall into Hell".{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=44}} This raised a "great doubt" (''taigi'') in him, since he thought that the formal entrance into monkhood and the daily enactment of rituals was the bodhi-mind.{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=44}} Only with his final awakening, at age 42, did he fully realize what "bodhi-mind" means, namely working for the good of others.{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=44}}

====Zen sickness====
Hakuin's early extreme exertions affected his health, and at one point in his young life he fell ill for almost two years, experiencing what would now probably be classified as a [[nervous breakdown]] by Western medicine. He called it [[Zen sickness]], and sought the advice of a [[Taoist]] cave dwelling hermit named Hakuyu, who prescribed a [[Mental image|visualization]] and breathing practice which eventually relieved his symptoms.  From this point on, Hakuin put a great deal of importance on physical strength and health in his Zen practice, and studying Hakuin-style Zen required a great deal of stamina. Hakuin often spoke of strengthening the body by concentrating the spirit, and followed this advice himself. Well into his seventies, he claimed to have more physical strength than he had at age thirty, being able to sit in zazen meditation or chant sutras for an entire day without fatigue.  The practices Hakuin learned from Hakuyu are still passed down within the Rinzai school.

===Head priest at Shōin-ji===
After another several years of travel, at age 31 Hakuin returned to Shoin-ji, the temple where he had been ordained. He was soon installed as head priest, a capacity in which he would serve for the next half-century. When he was installed as head priest of Shōin-ji in 1718, he had the title of ''Dai-ichiza'', "First Monk":{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxix}}
{{quote|It was the minimum rank required by government regulation for those installed as temple priests and seems to have been little more than a matter of paying a fee and registering Hakuin as the incumbent of Shōin-ji.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxix}}}}

It was around this time that he adopted the name "Hakuin", which means "concealed in white", referring to the state of being hidden in the clouds and snow of mount Fuji.{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=71}}

====Final awakening====
Although Hakuin had several "satori experiences", he did not feel free, and was unable to integrate his realization into his ordinary life.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xviii}} At age 41, he experienced a final and total awakening, while reading the Lotus Sutra, the [[sutra]] that he had disregarded as a young student. He realized that the [[Bodhicitta|Bodhi-mind]] means working for the good of every sentient being:{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41}}
{{quote|It was the chapter on parables, where the Buddha cautions his disciple Shariputra against savoring the joys of [[Pratyekabuddha|personal enlightenment]], and reveals to him the truth of the [[Bodhisattva]]'s mission, which is to continue practice beyond enlightenment, teaching and helping others until all beings have attained salvation.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xviii}}}}

He wrote of this experience, saying "suddenly I penetrated to the perfect, true, ultimate meaning of the Lotus". This event marked a turning point in Hakuin's life. He dedicated the rest of his life to helping others achieve liberation.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xviii}}{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41}}

====Practicing the bodhi-mind====
He would spend the next forty years teaching at Shoin-ji, writing, and giving lectures. At first there were only a few monks there, but soon word spread, and Zen students began to come from all over the country to study with Hakuin. Eventually, an entire community of monks had built up in Hara and the surrounding areas, and Hakuin's students numbered in the hundreds. He eventually would certify over eighty disciples as successors.

====Is that so?====
A well-known anecdote took place in this period:
{{quote|A beautiful Japanese girl whose parents owned a food store lived near Hakuin. One day, without any warning, her parents discovered she was pregnant. This made her parents angry. She would not confess who the man was, but after much harassment at last named Hakuin.&lt;br&gt;
In great anger the parents went to the master. "Is that so?" was all he would say.&lt;br&gt;
After the child was born it was brought to Hakuin. By this time he had lost his reputation, which did not trouble him, but he took very good care of the child. He obtained milk from his neighbors and everything else the child needed by [[takuhatsu]].&lt;br&gt;
A year later the girl could stand it no longer. She told her parents the truth - the real father of the child was a young man who worked in the fish market.&lt;br&gt;
The mother and father of the girl at once went to Hakuin to ask forgiveness, to apologize at length, and to get the child back.&lt;br&gt;
Hakuin smiled and willingly yielded the child, saying: "Is that so? It's good to hear this baby has his/her father"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Reps|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kimihiko|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Death===
At the age of 83, Hakuin died in Hara, the same village in which he was born and which he had transformed into a center of Zen teaching.

===Post-satori practice===
[[Hakuin]] saw "deep compassion and commitment to help all sentient beings everywhere"{{sfn|Low|2006|p=35}} as an indispensable part of the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Buddhist path to awakening]]. Hakuin emphasized the need for "post-satori training",{{sfn|Waddell|2010}}{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}} purifying the mind of karmic tendencies and 
{{quote|[W]hipping forward the wheel of the Four Universal Vows, pledging yourself to benefit and save all sentient beings while striving every minute of your life to practice the great Dharma giving.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}}}

The insight in the need of arousing [[bodhicitta]] formed Hakuin's final awakening:
{{quote|What is to be valued above all else is the practice that comes after satori is achieved. What is that practice? It is the practice that puts the [[Bodhicitta|Mind of Enlightenment]] first and foremost.&lt;br&gt;
[At] my forty-first year, [...] I at long last penetrated into the heart of this great matter. Suddenly, unexpectedly, I saw it — it was as clear as if it were right there in the hollow of my hand. What is the Mind of Enlightenment? It is, I realized, a matter of doing good — benefiting others by giving them the gift of the Dharma teaching.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}}}

===Koan practice===
Hakuin deeply believed that the most effective way for a student to achieve insight was through extensive [[meditation]] on a koan. Only with incessant investigation of his koan will a student be able to become one with the koan, and attain enlightenment. The psychological pressure and [[doubt]] that comes when one struggles with a koan is meant to create tension that leads to awakening. Hakuin called this the "great doubt", writing, "At the bottom of great doubt lies great awakening. If you doubt fully, you will awaken fully".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40980460|title=Sculpture in the age of doubt|last=1939-2013,|first=McEvilley, Thomas,|isbn=9781581150230|location=New York|oclc=40980460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hakuin used a fivefold classification system:{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=148}}&lt;br&gt;
1. ''Hosshin'', dharma-body koans, are used to awaken the first insight into [[sunyata]].{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=148}} They reveal the [[dharmakaya]], or Fundamental.{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=136}} They introduce "the undifferentiated and the unconditional".{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=136-137}}&lt;br&gt;
2. ''Kikan'', dynamic action koans, help to understand the phenomenal world as seen from the awakened point of view;{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=148-149}} Where ''hosshin'' koans represent ''tai'', substance, ''kikan'' koans represent ''yu'', function.{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=137}}&lt;br&gt;
3. ''Gonsen'', explication of word koans, aid to the understanding of the recorded sayings of the old masters.{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=149}} They show how the Fundamental, though not depending on words, is nevertheless expressed in words, without getting stuck to words.{{clarify|date=August 2014}}{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=138}}&lt;br&gt;
4. ''Hachi Nanto'', eight "difficult to pass" koans.{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=135}} There are various explanations for this category, one being that these koans cut off clinging to the previous attainment. They create another Great Doubt, which shatters the self attained through ''satori''. {{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=139}} It is uncertain which are exactly those eight koans.{{sfn|Hori|2003|p=23}} Hori gives various sources, which altogether give ten ''hachi nanto'' koans.{{sfn|Hori|2003|p=23-24}}&lt;br&gt;
5.  ''Goi jujukin'' koans, the [[Five Ranks|Five Ranks of Tozan]] and the Ten Grave Precepts.{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=151}}{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=135}}

Hakuin's emphasis on koan practice had a strong influence in the Japanese Rinzai-school. In the system developed by his followers, students are assigned koans by their teacher and then meditate on them. Once they have broken through, they must demonstrate their insight in private interview with the teacher.  If the teacher feels the student has indeed attained a satisfactory insight into the koan, then another is assigned. Hakuin's main role in the development of this koan system was most likely the selection and creation of koans to be used. In this he didn't limit himself to the classic koan collections inherited from China; he himself originated one of the best-known koans, "You know the sound of two hands clapping; tell me, what is the sound of one hand?".  Hakuin preferred this new koan to the most commonly assigned first koan from the Chinese tradition, the [[Mu (Japanese word)|Mu]] koan. He believed his "Sound of One Hand" to be more effective in generating the great doubt, and remarked that "its superiority to the former methods is like the difference between cloud and mud".

===Four ways of knowing===
{{See also|Huayan school#Four Dharmadhatu|l1=Four Dharmadhatu|Five wisdoms}}

Asanga, one of the main proponents of [[Yogacara]], introduced the idea of four ways of knowing: the perfection of action, observing knowing, universal knowing, and great mirror knowing. He relates these to the [[Eight Consciousnesses]]: 
# The five senses are connected to the perfection of action,
# Samjna (cognition) is connected to observing knowing,
# Manas (mind) is related to universal knowing,
# Alaya-vijnana is connected to great mirror knowing.{{sfn|Low|2006|p=22}}
In time, these ways of knowing were also connected to the doctrine of the [[Trikaya|three bodies of the Buddha]] ([[Dharmakāya]], [[Sambhogakāya]] and Nirmanakaya), together forming the "Yuishiki doctrine".{{sfn|Low|2006|p=22}}

Hakuin related these four ways of knowing to four gates on the Buddhist path: the Gate of Inspiration, the Gate of Practice, the Gate of Awakening, and the Gate of Nirvana.{{sfn|Low|2006|p=32-39}}
# The Gate of Inspiration is initial awakening, [[kensho]], seeing into one's true nature.
# The Gate of Practice is the purification of oneself by continuous practice.
# The Gate of Awakening is the study of the ancient masters and the Buddhist sutras, to deepen the insight into the Buddhist teachings, and acquire the skills needed to help other sentient beings on the Buddhist path to awakening.
# The Gate of Nirvana is the "ultimate liberation", "knowing without any kind of defilement".{{sfn|Low|2006|p=32-39}}

===Opposition to "Do-nothing Zen"===
One of Hakuin's major concerns was the danger of what he called "Do-nothing Zen" teachers, who upon reaching some small experience of enlightenment devoted the rest of their life to, as he puts it, "passing day after day in a state of seated sleep".{{sfn|Hakuin|2010|p=3}} Quietist practices seeking simply to empty the mind, or teachers who taught that a tranquil "emptiness" was enlightenment, were Hakuin's constant targets. In this regard he was especially critical of  followers of the maverick Zen master [[Bankei]].{{sfn|Hakuin|2010|p=125, 126}} He stressed a never-ending and severe training to deepen the insight of enlightenment and forge one's ability to manifest it in all activities.{{sfn|Waddell|2010}}{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}} He urged his students to never be satisfied with shallow attainments, and truly believed that enlightenment was possible for anyone if they exerted themselves and approached their practice with real energy.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}

===Lay teachings===
An extremely well known and popular Zen master during his later life, Hakuin was a firm believer in bringing the wisdom of Zen to all people. Thanks to his upbringing as a commoner and his many travels around the country, he was able to relate to the [[rural]] population, and served as a sort of spiritual father to the people in the areas surrounding Shoin-ji. In fact, he turned down offers to serve in the great monasteries in [[Kyoto]], preferring to stay at Shoin-ji. Most of his instruction to the common people focused on living a morally virtuous life. Showing a surprising broad-mindedness, his ethical teachings drew on elements from [[Confucianism]], ancient Japanese traditions, and traditional Buddhist teachings. He also never sought to stop the rural population from observing non-Zen traditions, despite the seeming intolerance for other schools' practices in his writings.

In addition to this, Hakuin was also a popular Zen lecturer, traveling all over the country, often to Kyoto, to teach and speak on Zen. He wrote frequently in the last fifteen years of his life, trying to record his lessons and experiences for posterity. Much of his writing was in the [[vernacular]], and in popular forms of poetry that commoners would read.

===Calligraphy===
An important part of Hakuin's practice of Zen was his painting and [[calligraphy]]. He seriously took up painting only late in his life, at almost age sixty, but is recognized as one of the greatest Japanese Zen painters. His paintings were meant to capture Zen values, serving as sorts of "visual sermons" that were extremely popular among the laypeople of the time, many of whom were [[illiterate]]. Today, paintings of Bodhi Dharma by Hakuin Ekaku are sought after and displayed in a handful of the world's leading museums.

==Influence==
Through Hakuin, all contemporary Japanese Rinzai-lineages are part of the [[Ōtōkan]] lineage, brought to Japan in 1267 by [[Nanpo Jomyo]], who received dharma transmission in China in 1265.&lt;ref group=web name=ROZ&gt;[http://zen.rinnou.net/whats_zen/history.html#The%20Transmission%20of%20Zen%20to%20Japan Rinzai-Obaku Zen - What is Zen? - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

All contemporary Rinzai-lineages stem from Inzan Ien (1751–1814) and Takuju Kosen (1760–1833),{{sfn|Dumoulin-2005-B|p=392}}{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=90}} both students of Gasan Jito (1727–1797). Gasan is considered to be a dharma heir of Hakuin, though "he did not belong to the close circle of disciples and was probably not even one of Hakuin's dharma heirs".{{sfn|Dumoulin-2005-B|p=391}}

==Writings==
Hakuin left a voluminous body of works, divided in Dharma Works (14 vols.) and [[Kanbun]] Works (4 vols.).&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.zenbunka.or.jp/en/investigation/entry/post_17.html Hakuin Study Group] has been researching the written works of Hakuin.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are the best known and edited in English.

'''I am a Curator''' was a process-based exhibition project by artist [[Per Hüttner]] that took place at [[Chisenhale Gallery]], London, UK, 5 November – 14 December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Background==
[[File:I.am.a.curator.13.11.03.jpg|thumb|right|''Installation view from I am a Curator''&lt;br&gt;Chisenhale Gallery, 13 November 2003, Muller Kneer Associates]]

Hüttner carried out a series of exhibitions that democratized or investigated the curatorial process in the late 1990s and in the early years of the new millennium.&lt;ref&gt;A Tasty Treat, James Westcott, [[Zingmagazine]] 18; p.270-272; 2003; New York, United States&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these were collaborative and took place at the Gallery [[Konstakuten]] in Stockholm, [[The Hood Gallery]] in Los Angeles but also in galleries and public spaces in London, New York City and [[Vancouver]] and involved artists from different generations and included [[Geoffrey Farmer]], [[Brian Jungen]], [[Lenke Rothman]], [[Neil Goldstein]] and curators like [[Reid Shier]] and [[Tone O Nielsen]].&lt;ref&gt;Amelie Nordenfelt, ''Introduction", ''Curatorial Mutiny'', p. 9, edited by Per Hüttner, 2003, 120 pages, texts by: Per Hüttner, Amelie Nordenfelt, Gavin wade, Tone O. Nielsen, Drabble+Sachs, Claire Canning and Tone Hansen. Design by Voodoo Graphics and Jonas Lindén. Published by Föreningen Curatorial MutinyStockholm, 2003. {{ISBN|91-631-3247-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he created the curatorial framework for an exhibition at [[Nylon (gallery)|Nylon]] in collaboration with [[Goshka Macuga]] and [[Gavin Wade]].&lt;ref&gt;Neal Brown, [http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/3_in_1_curatorial_mutiny_part_4/ ''3 in 1 Curatorial Mutiny, Part 4'', ''Frieze'', Issue 60, June – August 2001.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203192526/http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/3_in_1_curatorial_mutiny_part_4/ |date=3 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2002 at Curatorial Market at [[Cuchifritos]] and various public venues including [[Essex Street Market]] in New York. In these projects he developed ideas and practices that pointed towards a new way of relating to the art object and exhibition making that eventually became manifest in I am a Curator.:&lt;ref&gt;A Tasty Treat, James Westcott, Zingmagazine 18; p.270-272; 2003; New York City&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Despite its populist ideals, the Curatorial Market raises complex, insider issues about the relationship between artist and curator. ‘These two disciplines are beginning to mix and merge in ways that some people find appalling and others see as a powerful new development in the history of art making,’ [[Paul Clay]] explains. However, abandoning the idea of the autonomous piece of art can be problematic. ‘Having art that relates very strongly to the market context can fuck up the commodification process in an interesting way. It both points it up as an object to consume, and at the same time makes it harder to effectively remove from its context in order to be sold.’ Furthermore, ‘There is a danger that when curators have too strong an {{sic|?|hide=y|over-|arching}} vision, the artists' works can end up simply as building blocks used to construct the curator's point. On the other hand if the curator's point is weak then the works can get stranded totally out of context’."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hüttner has since developed these strategies both in projects like Repetitive Time,&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner: Repetitive Time, 2006, 116 pages including 30 colour plates, texts by Lena Boëthius, Laurent Devèze, Per Hüttner, Claire Canning and Stéphanie Nava, language: English, design by Henrik Gistvall.

==Basic structure==

During six weeks people or groups of people with no prior experience in exhibition making undertook 36 investigative exercises into the process of putting together an exhibition. From the outset, the idea was to create an exhibition each day, but quickly the focus moved to investigate the 57 artworks as a resource. In order to realize this strategy the artist developed some basic concepts:

'''Curator of the Day''': The daily slots were administered through an application process through which we tried to give as many different people as possible, in relation to occupation, age, sex, social and ethnic background. More often than not, the Curator of Day was a small group. Meaning that in the end roughly 70 people were curators.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

'''The Gallery Crew''': The Gallery Crew was the Curators of the Day’s aid in developing their ideas and the project that they wanted to realize during the day. The Curator of the Day was not allowed to touch the artwork, except in those cases when this was an integral part of the piece. All the handling and mounting of the work was carried out by the Gallery Crew. The crew was also responsible for informing the visitors to the gallery about the project and answering questions.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

'''Support Structure''': Support Structure hosted all the artwork. It was mobile and it was also used to display work, as well as change the size and appearance of the space. It incorporated two tables and half a dozen chairs that could also be used as plinths to present work on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.supportstructure.org&lt;/ref&gt; But [[Celine Condorelli]] and [[Gavin Wade]] took their brief further and allowed Support Structure be a questioning and critical tool and an important aspect of the process of the project. The structure took the centre stage, but in an unexpected way the Curators of the Day remained strangely blind to the eleven meter long monster object on wheels and few, if any, references were made to it in their reports.&lt;ref&gt;Support Structures, Celine Condorelli, p. 115-128, Sternberg Press (2009), {{ISBN|978-1-933128-45-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two also offered objects and lists of what to do if the Curator of the Day gets stuck and included phone numbers to well-known contemporary curators.&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Neill, p.168, Metropolis Rise: New Art from London, edited by Anthony Gross and Jen Wu, {{Proper name|temporarycontemporary}}, London 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Selectors''': To provide a dynamic collection for the Curator of the Day to choose from, six people were asked to select artwork for I Am a Curator. Each devised a different approach for his or her selection. They were [[Patrick Bernier]], [[Melanie Keen]], [[Lisa Le Feuvre]], Tone O. Nielsen, Reid Shier and Per Hüttner.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

'''The Interface Cards''': A5-sized plastic cards were designed and realized by American artist [[Scott Rigby]]. For each artwork available for selection there was one corresponding Interface Card. The Interface Cards along with the website (which used the same design) were the main tools for the Curator of the Day to select artwork and devise their exhibition.&lt;ref name="Introdictionary" /&gt;

The Website: All the artwork available for selection could be browsed on Chisenhale Gallery’s website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chisenhale.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; There was also continually updated photographic documentation of the exhibitions created by the Curators of the Day.

==The exhibitions and the audience==

[[File:I.am.a.curator.11.12.03.jpg|thumb|''Installation view from I am a Curator''&lt;br&gt;Chisenhale Gallery, 11 December 2003, Anton Nikolotov]]

Each of the 36 exhibitions realized within the framework of I am a Curator took on very different forms and used the artwork and the space in very different ways. Artist [[Hannah Rickards]] who was leading the gallery crew describes an exhibition that had great impact on the development of the project:&lt;ref name="dialogue"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Embassy of Work With Me ([[å.b.ä.k.e]] /[[Royal College of Art|RCA]]), emptied Support Structure of all its contents, Jokers and artworks, and developed a chromatic scale around the walls of the gallery (the structure having been pushed to the corner). The colour of the individual group members’ clothes determined which works they had responsibility for placing. The process had a very easily achieved self-perpetuating logic that extended to colour-coding drill batteries, [[masking tape]], [[spirit level]]s, any tools that we may have set down for a moment. The colour-coding also included the covers of the CDs bought from the local junk shop in order to complete [[Sam Ely and Lynn Harris]]’ Playlist, along with all the book covers from [[Céline Condorelli]]’s and Gavin Wade's Joker selection of books. This seemed the most natural and successful exercise in [[devolution]] and levelling democratization that occurred during the run of the show. The ‘artworks’ suffered less in this [[melee]] than they often did when not surrounded by a [[chromatic]] sea of things; they were scrutinized and investigated by the curating group."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hüttner talks about a few of the key experiences among the 36 exhibitions:&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;”I have to mention Anton Nikolotov’s project (11/12/03). He wanted the work to be selected democratically. He thus devoted the whole day [[discussion|discussing]] with the visitors which works should be displayed. Each visitor who was present at a given moment was given some time to voice why a certain piece should or shouldn't be shown. When everyone had presented their case, the group [[election|voted]] and notes were taken on the different ideas and how many votes the different pieces got. In the end the only show that was presented was one made up of these notes shown in the massive empty space. This approach allowed I Am a Curator to be taken to another level. The boundaries between Curator of the Day and audience vanished entirely. It was wonderful to see how the process of democratization could be taken one step further than had originally been foreseen. This [[democratic process]] was at once extremely rewarding, but also hugely tiring. Rarely have I seen the members of the Gallery Crew leave so happy and tired. It was also great to see how visitors tended to stay for hours to join the discussion. At one point 15 people were present for the vote."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other shows included Sebastian Roach's Art for Wine Day 13/12/03 which took quite a [[nihilism|nihilist]] approach to the task of selecting work:&lt;ref&gt;”Sebastian Roach is a Curator”, e-mail sent out to Chisenhale mailing list, December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;”In exchange for the donation of a bottle of wine (or beer, or spirits  – even a miniature, the important thing is the token) a visitor can select and display any piece of work in the show. Alternatively they can donate a new piece of work and I will give them a bottle of wine in exchange for it. In addition, through the course of the day I will install myself in an ‘office’ created by using the versatile structure as walls drinking wine, smoking cigarettes and writing.  What I write will be spontaneous and in response – directly, indirectly, or entirely [[tenuous]]ly – to the work, the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and the situation, and will obviously also be tempered by the increasing consumption of alcohol. Whatever writing I do produce at the end of the day will also be available in [[Trade|exchange]] for wine."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The diversity of the Curator of the Day and how they interacted with the work can be exemplified by Hüttner's [[endnote]] in the catalogue:&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;” The data that I Am a Curator generated is in itself something that would suffice for a research  project. I was pleased on the last day of the exhibition that the two [[anthropologist]]s Lisa Maddigan and Fuyubi Nakamura did a project that looked at the accumulated information. I think that they were slightly awestruck by the sheer bulk of information and work that could be hosted within the project. It is like the number of possibilities of arranging 57 artworks that Maki from å.b.ä.k.e. had calculated – 144,115,188,075,856,000. Considering that our [[solar system]] is roughly 2,400,000,000,000,000 minutes old [[probability|the number of possibilities]] is quite mind-boggling.
”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Critique==

At the time of the realization of the project there was some rather loud critique towards the project.&lt;ref&gt;p. 157, Barnaby Drabble, Stop making Sense: The Ends of Curating and the Beginnings of the Exhibition, Thesis submitted to the Edinburgh College of Art in fulfilment Of the requirements of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Neill, The Culture of Curating and the Curating of Culture(s), 2012, p. 112-14, The MIT Press, Cambridge Massachusetts 02142, {{ISBN|9780262017725}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it offered a very traditional approach to the idea of how an exhibition might be made. In an interview with Barnaby Drabble the artist says.&lt;ref&gt;Per Hüttner, '' Per Hüttner and Gavin Wade interviewed by Barnaby Drabble '', '' Marianne Eigenheer (Hg.) Curating Critique'', '' ICE Reader 1'', 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-86588-451-0}}]&lt;/ref&gt;":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I do agree, when you are faced with the possibility of just selecting existing art work that is a very traditional take on what a curator is. But then again, I think that I Am A Curator tried to do something that goes beyond that. By using a very traditional approach it enabled us to do something that was extremely creative and which opened new ideas about how to put together exhibitions. In terms of selecting the works, It wasn't as if they had only five pieces to choose from. To consider the work of fifty-seven artists in one afternoon is a major task. Also, a lot of the work was not finished, it was up to the curator of the day to complete it, a lot was interactive, and a lot had different elements that needed to be put together. So there were many different approaches on offer, reflecting the working methods of the original selectors."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another criticism of the project was that the individual artwork never got the attention it deserved.&lt;ref&gt;"Le curating est le reponse...", Paul O'Neill, 02#35, p.14-16, 2005, Nantes, France&lt;/ref&gt; Hannah Rickards who was leading the gallery crew writes:&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Even the 57 official ‘artworks,’ depending on their treatment by the Curator of the Day, sometimes barely managed to retain their “artwork” status. There were times when they did slip into being things in cupboards or things on the wall. That slippage between artworks and objects, or between people’s roles in the process, is something I see as having been central to the project, so I don’t know if I necessarily see the need for a posthumous proliferation of the term “artwork.” It feels like [[lamination|laminating]] a piece of paper you are still making notes on. In the context of this project a wipe-clean definition seems to jar."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review for ''C: International Contemporary Art Magazine'', [[Fergal Stapleton]] described the exhibition as "a game, mutative and feudal, with several tiers of collusion" and "a bid for curatorial practice as art, and for curatorial supremacy over its subject arts disciplines."&lt;ref name="Stapleton"&gt;{{cite journal|title='I am a curator'.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his PhD thesis Barnaby Drabble uses I am a Curator as one of three case studies. He quotes Stapleton and builds a severe critique to the project which he perceives as being elitist and self-promotional under the guise of being democratic.&lt;ref&gt;p. 155-157, Barnaby Drabble, Stop making Sense: The Ends of Curating and the Beginnings of the Exhibition, Thesis submitted to the Edinburgh College of Art in fulfillment Of the requirements of the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On a more positive note British sociologist and media theorist, [[David Gauntlett]] suggests that projects like I am a Curator expands art into being a visual sociology;&lt;ref&gt;David Gauntlett, "Creative Explorations New Approaches to Identities and Audiences", p. 119-20. Routledge, London, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We should note that, in some cases, the work of socially engaged visual artists and the work of visual sociologists can look very similar. Many artists have used art to explore identity, memory and the construction of selfhood [...]. Other contemporary artists have engaged in a more externally oriented art practice which involves ‘ordinary’ people in the making of work. Just as visual sociology sometimes blurs into something like art, in these projects, art expands into being a kind of visual sociology. There are many instances of such projects; here I will give just a few examples. A project by the artist Per Hüttner, at Chisenhale Gallery, London, entitled I Am a Curator, gave 30 individuals or groups the opportunity to be ‘Curator of the Day’, over a period of six weeks (5 November–14 December 2003). Each day a new exhibition was assembled, using work by 57 artists that was made available in the gallery."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is clear that, I am a Curator offered novel ways for the audience to interact with artwork and the idea of an exhibition. They were forced to deal with art in a more intimate way than in a traditional exhibition. This means that the art on display might have been visible to a smaller audience than in a normal situation and yet at the same time the [[intimacy]], reflection and constant change of context that the work was perceived in, meant that the audience was offered the possibility to understand the complexities and contradictions of artwork on a more profound level.&lt;ref name="dialogue" /&gt; This experimental approach to authorship and authenticity offers opportunity for creative interpretations.&lt;ref name="Form p.134-35"/&gt; This openness in its turn has led to that I am a Curator has been appropriated by various participants of the project as being 'their own' in publications and academic texts.&lt;ref name="Form p.134-35"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jes Fernie, Two Minds: Artists And Architects in Collaboration, p. 136-142, Black Dog Publishing, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ten Year Anniversary==

For the 10 year anniversary of I am a Curator [[David Roberts Art Foundation]] in London invited Per Huttner to reflect on the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vision-forum.blogspot.nl/2013/09/i-am-curator-after-10-years-what.html Vision Forum website]&lt;/ref&gt; In the press release it is stated that "The project also provoked profound questions about artistic identity and its relationship to collectivity. Both shifts, in turn, lead to changed perspectives on the relationship between artworks, exhibitions, curators and artists. In short, IAAC opened a floodgate of problematics that overwhelmed the team working with the project. It is therefore important to revisit these questions after 10 years have passed, and to see how they have influenced individual artistic processes and how they can guide us into meaningful future reflections on related issues."&lt;ref&gt;Press release on The David Roberts Art Foundation website [http://davidrobertsartfoundation.com/projects/i-am-a-curator-after-10-years-what-defines-an-artistic-practice-tuesday-29-october-2013-6-30-to-8-30pm]/&lt;/ref&gt; Per Hüttner was joined by artist/architect [[Céline Condorelli]], [[neuroscientist]] [[Stephen Whitmarsh]] and Anette and [[Alberto Giacometti Foundation]] Director [[Véronique Wiesinger]].

'''''Isa Kremer: The People's Diva''''', is a [[Documentary film|documentary]] produced in 2000 and directed by  Nina Baker Feinberg &lt;ref name= "WOMEN MAKE MOVIES | Nina Baker Feinberg"&gt;{{cite web
  | title =  Nina Baker Feinberg
  | publisher =WOMEN MAKE MOVIES

  | accessdate = June 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ted Schillinger. It focuses on Isa Kremer, an international singing sensation.

==Summary==
Isa performed modern renditions of traditional [[Jewish]] folk songs for audiences around the world, refusing to conceal her Jewish culture even during the [[Holocaust]]. The film explores the life of a woman who brought Jewish music to international audiences. ''Isa Kremer'' reconstructs the [[singer]]'s life through archival footage of her performances, family interviews, and the critic’s responses to her shows.&lt;ref name= "Isa Kremer: The People's Diva "&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Isa Kremer: The People's Diva 
  | publisher =The New York Times

  | accessdate = June 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;   She had a beautiful, well-trained voice but, it was her alluring presence that enthralled audiences.

As a young girl, Isa was marked by a fierce talent, independent mind and firm determination. At age fifteen, her poems were being published in the liberal “Odessa News.”  Isa enjoyed early career success as a [[classical music|classical]] and [[opera]] singer. However, it was Jewish poet [[Chaim Bialik]] upon seeing her perform suggested that she sing Jewish folk songs instead.  Isa took the advice to heart and immediately rethought her performances. She began to sing in [[Yiddish]] and adapted Jewish folk songs for the stage. Trained in opera, Ida combined singing and acting in a novel way, embodying the characters she sang about, and made simple folk songs part of a grand tradition. With her unique show and dazzling stage presence, Isa toured internationally. This allowed her to befriend the social elite and intelligentsia (including [[Albert Einstein]]), collect stunning jewelry and receiving lavish praise. One critic described her as “a radiant incarnation of artist’s witchery.”

Despite her success, Isa’s life was never easy. She saw some of the 20th century’s most violent political failures. War and revolution seemed to follow her wherever she went. Isa was born in [[Russia]], and when the Revolution broke out, it separated her family. She moved away from [[Europe]] before the Holocaust, but watched it destroy the lives of her family and the shtetl lifestyle in which she was raised. Then, in the last chapters of her life, she witnessed brutal political unrest in her adopted home country of [[Argentina]].

''Isa Kremer'' participates in a debate that’s still relevant today — the working woman. In order to travel and perform as freely as she did, Isa had to make sacrifices. Relationships and her family were secondary to her demanding career. Isa’s daughter gives a sad smile while explaining that she was raised by a [[wet nurse]] and knew her mother only by the splendid parties that were thrown when she came home from touring.

The documentary also recognizes the struggle between cultural and personal identity. Isa was not religious and never wanted to be a Jewish singer; she wanted to be a great singer. But she expected that her Yiddish songs would appeal to everyone, not just Jews. “It must be an art for the great mass of people,” she explained, believing Jewish folk songs were so rich in meaning and beauty they could touch all of humanity.

==Education==

Pakenham-Walsh trained as an artist at [[Lancaster and Morecambe College|Lancaster and Morecambe College of Arts and Crafts]] (1954–58) and [[Wimbledon College of Art]] (1958-59).&lt;ref name="Aberystwyth University" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian obituary" /&gt; The writer and artist [[Mervyn Peake]] was an early mentor.&lt;ref name="Cambrian News obituary" /&gt;

==Career==

From the beginning of her career, Pakenham-Walsh created drawings, paintings, and sculptures made almost exclusively from mundane and salvaged materials;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aberystwyth University" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ceredigion Museum FaceBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian obituary"/&gt; this unique strategy was borne of necessity as Pakenham-Walsh encountered "social barriers associated with being a female artist in the mid twentieth century, which made it difficult for her [...] to acquire raw materials for her art."&lt;ref name="Ceredigion Museum FaceBook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabel Pakenham-Walsh A Retrospective video" /&gt; Pakenham-Walsh's first published artwork was in the early 1960s when her [[Ballpoint pen|biro]] drawings appeared in the literary journal ''[[Transatlantic Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 41512113| title=The Transatlantic Review No. 11, Notes on Contributors|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=41514022| title=The Transatlantic Review No. 12, Notes on Contributors|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, she was employed as a designer at [[Pinewood Studios]], where she created set-pieces for major motion-pictures, including [[Cleopatra (1963 film)|''Cleopatra'']]; she also worked as a sculptor at [[Shepperton Studios]].&lt;ref name="Cambrian News obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News Biographical article" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/anw/get_collection.php?coll_id=848&amp;inst_id=1&amp;term=Artists%20%7C%20Wales%20%7C%20Archives |title=Mabel Pakenham-Walsh Papers |publisher=The National Library of Wales |access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News art show article"&gt;{{cite news |last=Davies |first=Clive |title=Woodcarving in Coalshed Brings Fame |date=1 January 1982 |access-date=13 August 2016 |url=https://www.ceredigion.gov.uk/utilities/action/act_download.cfm?mediaid=28070&amp;langtoken=eng}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1965 to 1982, she exhibited at the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition|Summer Exhibitions]] of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Royal Academy Exhibitors, 1905—1970 Vol. 5 |location=The Getty Research Center |publisher=EP Publishing Limited |year=1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Royal Academy Exhibitors, 1971—1989 |location=The Getty Research Center |publisher=Hilmarton Manor Press |year=1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this era, select London artists rejected abstraction and conceptualism to pursue "the depiction of the human figure and everyday landscape";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/london/inner.html |title=London Calling |last1=Brooks |first1=Julian |last2=Potts |first2=Timothy |website=getty.edu |publisher=Getty Publications |year=2016 |access-date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakenham-Walsh also sought to depict ordinary daily life, creating art that was both "playful and profound [to] invoke the [[Flow (psychology)|deep time]] of human nature."&lt;ref name="Ceredigion Museum FaceBook" /&gt; Pakenham-Walsh "exhibited widely in her lifetime in many art galleries and museums" worldwide.&lt;ref name="Cambrian News obituary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News art show article" /&gt; Her work has been shown at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and is held in numerous public and private collections, including: the [[National Library of Wales]], the [[Ulster Museum]], [[Aberystwyth University]], and the [[UK Craft Council]]; the actor and art historian [[Vincent Price]] and the photographer [[Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Lord Snowdon]] also admired and collected her work.&lt;ref name="Mabel Pakenham-Walsh A Retrospective video" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambrian News art show article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Good Reads article"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/5690320-ten-to-one-author-interview---yasmin-ali |title=Ten To One author interview - Yasmin Ali |publisher=Good Reads |access-date= 11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aberystwyth University archive"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museum.aber.ac.uk/person/782 |title=Mabel Pakenham-Walsh |publisher=Aberystwyth University |access-date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crafts Council"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.craftscouncil.org.uk/results?mi_search_type=adv&amp;mi_adv_search=yes&amp;sort=1&amp;maker_id=AUTH982 |title=Crafts Council Collections |publisher=Crafts Council |access-date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mundas-et-Infans-frontispiece-1522.png|thumb|The 1522 cover of ''[[The World and the Child|Mundus et Infans]]'', a morality play]]
The '''morality play''' is a [[genre]] of [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Tudor period|early Tudor]] theatrical entertainment. In their own time, these plays were known as '''''interludes''''', a broader term for dramas with or without a [[moral]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Johnston (1991, 97-98).&lt;/ref&gt; Morality plays are a type of [[allegory]] in which the [[protagonist]] is met by [[personification]]s of various [[morality|moral]] attributes who try to prompt him to choose a godly life over one of evil. The plays were most popular in [[Europe]] during the 15th and 16th centuries. Having grown out of the religiously based [[mystery play]]s of the Middle Ages, they represented a shift towards a more secular base for European theatre. [[Hildegard von Bingen]]'s ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'' (English: "Order of the Virtues") composed c. 1151, is the earliest known morality play by more than a century, and the only Medieval musical drama to survive with an attribution for both the text and the music.

==Characteristics==
Morality plays typically contain a protagonist who represents either humanity as a whole or a smaller social structure. Supporting characters are personifications of good and evil. This alignment of characters provides the play’s audience with moral guidance. Morality plays are the result of the dominant belief of the time period, that humans had a certain amount of control over their post-death fate while they were on earth.&lt;ref&gt;King, Pamela M. "Morality Plays". ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre''. Ed. Richard Beadle. Cambridge: Cambridge U P, 1994. 235. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'', perhaps the archetypal morality play, the characters take on the common pattern, representing broader ideas. Some of the characters in ''Everyman'' are God, Death, Everyman, Good-Deeds, Angel, Knowledge, Beauty, Discretion, and Strength. The personified meanings of these characters are hardly hidden. The premise of ''Everyman'' is that God, believing that the people on earth are too focused on wealth and worldly possessions, sends Death to Everyman to remind him of God's power and the importance of upholding values.&lt;ref&gt;''Everyman and Other Miracle and Morality Plays''. Ed. Stanley Appelbaum and Candace Ward. New York: Dover Publications, 1995. 36-59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis put on morality, the seemingly vast difference between good and evil, and the strong presence of God makes ''Everyman'' one of the most concrete examples of a morality play. At the same time, most morality plays focus more on evil, while ''Everyman'' focuses more on good, highlighting sin in contrast.&lt;ref&gt;King, Pamela M. "Morality Plays". ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre''. Ed. Richard Beadle. Cambridge: Cambridge U P, 1994. 257. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other plays that take on the typical traits of morality plays, but are rarely given the title of "morality play" are ''Hickscorner'' and ''The Second Shepherds' Play.'' The characters in ''Hickscorner'' are Pity, Perseverance, Imagination, Contemplation, Freewill, and Hickscorner. They blatantly represent moral ideals.&lt;ref&gt;
Everyman and Other Miracle and Morality Plays. Ed. Stanley Appelbaum and Candace Ward. New York: Dover Publications, 1995. 60. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Second Shepherds' Play'', the characters are less obviously representative of good and evil, being primarily a trio of shepherds. But other characters such as Mary, The Child Christ, and An Angel show a strong moral presence and the importance of God in the play.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justice and Equity as characters==
In early English dramas [[Justice]] was personified as an entity which exercised “theological virtue or grace, and was concerned with the divine pronouncement of judgment on man”.&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson. "Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play."Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 406.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as time progressed, more moralities began to emerge; it is during this transitional period where one begins to see [[Justice]] begin to assume more and more the qualities of a judge.  The Justice in ''Respublica'' begins to concern himself with administering justice on “the criminal element”, rather than with the divine pronouncement on a generic representative of mankind.&lt;ref name="Respublica 1905"&gt;''Respublica'', ed. by Leonard A. Magnus (London, 1905), Extra Series XCIV.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first instance where one may observe a direct divergence from the theological virtues and concerns that were previously exerted by Justice in the morality plays of the fifteenth century. The Justice in ''Respublica'' is personified as a “civil force rather than a theological one”.&lt;ref name="Respublica 1905"/&gt; An evolution of sorts takes place within the morals and agendas of Justice, he begins to don on the Judicial Robe of prosecutor and executioner.

Another change envelops in the character of Justice during the sixteenth century in morality plays; [[Equity (law)|Equity]] replaces Justice and assumes the judiciary duties previously performed by Justice. This changing of rulers, or preceding justices, is done when Equity declares that his brother Justice has been banished from the country and that he (Equity) will from now on take on the duties of the former monarch, Justice.&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson . "Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play."Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 408.&lt;/ref&gt; This change of ruling heads is portrayed in the morality play, ''Liberality and Prodigality'', where Equity serves Virtue in the detection, arrest, and punishment of Prodigality for the robbery and murder of Tenacity, a yeoman in the country of Middlesex.&lt;ref&gt;''Liberality and Prodigality'', in ''A Select Collection of Old English Plays''. ed. by W. Carew Hazlitt (London, 1874), VIII, 329-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
So horrible a fact can hardly pleaded for favour:&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore go you, Equity, examine more diligently&lt;br /&gt;
The manner of this outrageous robbery:&lt;br /&gt;
And as the same by examination shall appear,&lt;br /&gt;
Due justice may be done in presence here.&lt;br /&gt; (''Liberality and Prodigality'' 377)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The meta phases that Justice undergoes during the sixteenth century in morality plays, from “Justice” to “Equity” further illustrates the evolution of Justice; not only did Justice change from a “theological abstraction to a civil servant”,&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson . "Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play."Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 409.&lt;/ref&gt; but he experienced a corporeal change as well.

One may readily observe the evolutionary progression of Justice as portrayed in the plays of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. One encounters Justice in the early-fifteenth-century moralities as a performer playing the role of a theological virtue or grace, and then one sees him develop to a more serious figure, occupying the position of an arbiter of justice during the sixteenth century. It is a journey of discovery and great change on which Justice welcomes one to embark as one leafs through the pages of morality plays.

==Pre-Reformation versus post-Reformation==
Although the purpose of all morality plays is to instruct listeners on the means of receiving redemption, morality plays after the [[Protestant Reformation]] are of a distinctly different [[didacticism]] than the morality plays before the Reformation.

Morality plays before the Reformation teach a [[Catholic Church |Catholic]] approach to redemption, with an emphasis on works and the sacraments, a view originating with [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 – c. 240 AD) and [[Cyprian]] (d. 258). The emphasis on works can be seen in the final speech in one of the most well-known of medieval morality plays, [[Everyman (play)|Everyman]], in which there is a clear statement about the necessity of good works for the one who desires heaven:
&lt;poem&gt; 
Doctor:  This moral men may have in mind;
Ye hearers, take it of worth, old and young,
And forsake pride, for he deceiveth you in the end,
And remember Beauty, Five-wits, Strength, and Discretion,
They all at last do Everyman forsake,
Save his Good-Deeds, there doth he take.
But beware, and they be small
Before God, he hath no help at all.
None excuse may be there for Everyman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawley |first=A. C.|title=Everyman and Medieval Miracle Plays |date=1974 |publisher= Dent |location=London |isbn=978-0-460-87280-5 |page =225}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
The importance of the sacraments is seen in the morality tale entitled [[Mankind (play)]].  In this play, the [[sacrament of penance]] is emphasized when the allegorical character Mercy speaks to Mankind:  “Come let us go to this cloister and incline your mind towards God.  Don’t sin thinking that you are assured mercy, that itself is a sin.  It’s not a good idea to take advantage of the Lord.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= McDonald |first1= Rick |title= Modern English Translation of Mankind |url= http://research.uvu.edu/mcdonald/3610/mankind.html |publisher =Utah Valley University|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Pre-Reformation plays emphasized the importance of the [[sacraments of the Catholic Church]] (such as partaking in mass and baptism), the church clergy, the church hierarchy, the church establishment in general, and the abstinence from the [[Seven Deadly Sins]]. Many of the morality tales were [[allegory |allegories]] and involved characters with names of Vices (e.g., Gluttony) and Virtues (e.g., Goodness).  Their purpose was to direct the playgoers to pursue virtue and renounce vice.

Frequently a character representing a Vice would state, upon his first appearance, that he was evil.  For example, in [[The Castle of Perseverance]], a character called Lust-Liking states:
&lt;poem&gt;
Lo, me! here ready Lord, to fare and to flee
To seek thee a servant valued and dear!
Whoso will by Folly ruled be, 
He is worthy to be a servant here,
Who slips into the Sins Seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Johnston |first =Alexandra F.|title=The Castle of Perseverance: A Modernization |url= http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~ajohnsto/cascomp.html |website= Computing in the Humanities and Social Sciences |publisher= University of Toronto|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
Even after this initial introduction, however, the Vice will continually reiterate to the audience that his nature is diabolic. Very often, the Vice presented will bring his character into criticism by the manner in which he presents himself to his audience, thus further demonstrating his wickedness. For example, the Vices in the earlier morality plays often spoke using vulgar language and by blasphemous swearing.  Often, these curses were spoken in [[Latin]], which being considered the holy language, made these curses even more offensive to the audience.  Moreover, the Vices often made a mockery of religious practices sacred to the audience, thereby castigating themselves in the eyes of their audience. Deceit is another means by which the Vice exposes his wickedness to the audience and serves as an example to them of what to avoid in a righteous life. Furthermore, in the pre-Reformation play, the Vices denounce their own characters by acting violently toward each other, and toward the Virtues.&lt;ref name= "Pineas, Rainer 1962"&gt;{{Citation | last = Pineas | first = Rainer | title = The English Morality Play as a Weapon of Religious Controversy | journal = Studies in English Literature | volume = 2 | number = 2 | year = 1962 | pages = 157–80 | publisher = JSTOR | format = Web | accessdate = 28 September 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the pre-Reformation morality plays sought to reinforce the establishment of the Catholic Church and Catholic doctrine, the post-Reformation morality plays worked to destroy Catholic credibility and demonise the Catholic Church.  Although post-Reformation morality plays were like its predecessor in that it also was concerned with the salvation of its audience, it differed in that it believed that the theology promoted by pre-Reformation plays was antithetical to salvation. Thus, a major shift in focus, from concern for the individual’s moral behaviour to concern for the individual's theological practices, occurred with the post-Reformation morality plays. The wave of [[Protestantism]] which fuelled the content of these plays dictated that more attention should be given to warning people against the Catholic Church than of their sinful nature.  The means of redemption, according to the philosophy embedded in post-Reformation morality plays, is dependent upon the audience understanding the truthfulness of Protestant theology and verses and also the deceptiveness and wickedness of Catholic theology, whose best example is the secular play of Calderón.&lt;ref name="Muratta Bunsen, Eduardo 2014"&gt;{{Citation | last = Muratta Bunsen | first = Eduardo | title = Leidenschaft des Zweifelns: Skepsis und Probabilismus in den Säkulardramen von Pedro Calderón de la Barca | language = de | publisher = FU | place = Berlin, DE | url = http://www.geisteswissenschaften.fu-berlin.de/we05/forschung/dissertationen/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vices in post-Reformation morality plays are almost always depicted as being Catholic. At times this depiction is achieved through their physical appearance. For example, Vices in post-Reformation morality plays would be dressed as cardinals, friars, monks, or the pope. Other times, the Vice comes out and states he is a Catholic, or elucidates that he is Catholic by swearing a Catholic pledge.  Oftentimes, the Vice in post-Reformation plays admits that Catholic theology is flawed, and that by being Catholic the Vice is committing treason.  Moreover, Vices often appear ignorant and naive, especially when it comes to their biblical understanding and knowledge of the [[New Testament]]. Often, morality plays coming out the post-Reformation period ridicule ritualistic Catholic practices. Furthermore, these plays postulated that Catholics were opposed to moral behaviour and truthfulness, and that the Catholic Church warped the text of the Bible to justify sinning. To deceive the victim of post-Reformation morality plays, the Vice typically assumes a new name to disguise what actual Vice he is.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Because the Vice is aggressively tied to Catholicism from the outset of the play, when the Vice is reprimanded and damned, so are his Catholic beliefs. Therefore, the Vice served as a central component to discrediting the Catholic Church in post-Reformation morality plays.&lt;ref name= "Pineas, Rainer 1962" /&gt;

The role of the Virtues in post-Reformation morality plays was to preach a message of salvation based upon an individual’s faith and the grace of God. They promoted Protestant beliefs of [[original sin]], the importance of bible reading and meditation, the marriage of clergymen, and the cleansing of sin only through Christ’s sacrifice; at the same time, they discredited the Catholic belief in [[transubstantiation]].&lt;ref name= "Pineas, Rainer 1962" /&gt;

The '''Ninth Bridgewater Treatise''' was published by [[Charles Babbage]] in 1837 as a response to the eight [[Natural theology#The Bridgewater Treatises|Bridgewater Treatises]] that the [[Earl of Bridgewater]], [[Francis Henry Egerton]], 8th Earl, had funded and in particular with reference to a comment in one of them by [[William Whewell]]

The book is a work of [[natural theology]], and incorporates extracts from related correspondence of Herschel with [[Charles Lyell]].&lt;ref&gt;Note I, in [http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/Ancillary/1838_Bridgewater_A25/1838_Bridgewater_A25.html darwin-online.org.uk, ''Babbage, Charles. 1838. The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise. 2d edn. London: John Murray.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Babbage put forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator.  In this book, Babbage dealt with relating interpretations between science and religion; on the one hand, he insisted that ''"there exists no fatal collision between the words of [[The Bible|Scripture]] and the facts of nature;"'' on the one hand, he wrote the [[Book of Genesis]] was not meant to be read literally in relation to geological terms. Against those who said these were in conflict, he wrote ''"that the contradiction they have imagined can have no real existence, and that whilst the testimony of [[Moses]] remains unimpeached, we may also can be permitted to confide in the testimony of our senses."''&lt;ref&gt;Babbage, [http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/bridgewater/b4.htm Ninth Bridgewater Treatise]. Chapter V. Further View of the same Subject. The Victorian Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Babbage also defends the belief in miracles, in his Chapter VIII, where he states:
{{Quote|It is more consistent with the attributes of the Deity to look upon miracles not as deviations from the laws assigned by the Almighty for the government of matter and of mind; but as the exact fulfilment of much more extensive laws than those we suppose to exist.|&lt;ref&gt;http://www.victorianweb.org/science/science_texts/bridgewater/b8.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Iranian handicrafts''' are [[handicraft]] works originating from [[Iran]].

==Weaving==
{{main|Persian carpet}}
*[[Ghalamkar]]
*[[Iranian Termeh]] (weaving special table cloths)

Termeh is a cloth which is woven since the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] era in [[Iran]]. There is an argument between researchers about its origin. In the past, the first step in termeh weaving was preparing its raw materials. So it was very important to be careful while preparing wool, washing and drying it. Weaving termeh needs proper wool which has long fibers. Usually the designs of Iranian termeh were the result of the co-operation between two main persons – an expert and a worker.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Weaving  termeh was a very careful, sensitive and time consuming work that a good weaver could produce only 25 to 30 centimeters (1 feet) in a day.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The background colors which are used in termeh are mostly jujube red, light red, green, orange and black. Termeh as a valuable textile has many different usages and patterns such as:
* Checked pattern which is like a beehive and is used for  tablecloth.
* Stripped pattern which is of two models – narrow and wide striped .
* Atabaki pattern which was one of the kashmiri’s termeh used for expensive fabric because it was a finely woven termeh. Usually nobles and aristocrats used it as costly and nice cloth.
* Zomorrodi pattern in which the green color was used more than the others.
* Kashmiri (cashmere) in which the shape of deer’s horn was used for its design.
Termeh is a very durable cloth in which fixed colors are used so it can be washed and dried easily. Nowadays termeh is mostly used for collectible tablecloth.These tablecloth are usually decorated with elaborative Persian  embroidery  called “sermeh doozy”.

*Turquoise Inlaying

Turquoise Inlaying both on jewelry and containers includes a copper, brass, silver, nickel or bronze object on parts of the surface of which small pieces of turquoise are set in mosaic fashion thus giving the object a special glamor. The production of Turquoise Inlaying includes two general stages:

'''''A. Goldsmith'''''
Goldsmith includes the making and preparation of the object intended for Turquoise Inlaying using one of the metals indicated above. This is done by a goldsmith or forger using hands, press machine or both. After the object is formed generally, be it a piece of jewelry or a container, the part to be turquoise inlaid is demarked and a thin metal strand (of the same material as the metal used in the fabrication of the object) called “kandan” is placed around and soldered onto it. This part around the intended form is a so-called wall standing two or three millimeters above the surface of the container. This is usually done by or sometimes the turquoise inlayer himself. If the part prepared for Turquoise Inlaying takes up too much of the surface with an empty looking background, strands of the same metal are used to place smaller patterns of decorative nature (such as flowers, bushes, etc.) inside it and soldered again. This both makes the work more beautiful and makes the turquoise inlaid surface stronger.

'''''B. Turquoise Inlaying'''''
First of all, the turquoise inlayer buys waste turquoise chips from turquoise forming workshops or turquoise mines in Mashhad, Neishabour or Damghan. Since such turquoise chips are usually accompanied by some earth and ordinary stone chips, they are first separated and cleaned. Then, the turquoise chips are graded based on their sizes so the right size turquoise chips are used in making each Turquoise Inlaying object in proportion to the surface area. In the next step, the object is heated (to about 30 °C) and, while heating, a “walnut lac” is sprinkled onto the parts that have to be turquoise laid so that the lac powder is almost melted and covers the intended surface. While the lac is still soft and sticky on the object surface, some of the turquoise chips that were prepared before based on their size are place on the work surface. The chips must be placed in a way so that no space is left between them as far as possible. In order to fill the possible gaps between turquoise chips, temperature is added (to about 40 °C) and some more lac powder is sprinkled onto the chips until the lac layer is softened to a melting form, and then try to fill all the spaces by adding smaller turquoise chips, or, as they say, the chips sit well on the surface. This is usually done by pressing the turquoise chips by hand onto the surface so that they stick fast to it. After the object is cooled, the lac covered parts become rigid. After that stage, the parts covered by lac and turquoise chips are polished with emery so the extra lac and little raised parts of the chips are flattened. That is the stage where the color of the turquoise chips becomes visible as turquoise and that of lac as black (or dark brown) in the spaces between the chips. After this stage is completed, if there is still some fallouts in some parts of the work, the object is heated again, and the empty parts are restored with small turquoise chips and lac. Then, the surface is polished and honed again. The restoration is sometimes done with a type of turquoise colored putty that is prepared with “mol” mud, oil and lapis paint. The final stage of Turquoise Inlaying is burnishing which is done in two stages itself. The first stage consists of burnishing the metal parts which is done at a goldsmith or machining workshop where the opaque layer that is formed on the metal parts during Turquoise Inlaying is removed with hand tools or a machine blade, and then, those parts are polished so the metal becomes shiny. The second stage consists of burnishing the turquoise inlaid product. After polishing the metal parts of the object, the work is returned to the turquoise inlayer’s workshop where the turquoise inlaid surface is polished with olive or sesame oil so that part becomes shiny, too.  A Turquois Inlaying craftsman employs different tools and devices for different stages of the job mostly including dies, hammers, drills, natural gas and gasoline torches, pincers, pliers, forceps, different metal pipes tweezers, files and emeries. The most important point in Turquoise Inlaying is correct installation of turquoise chips on the metal so that it is strong enough and the chips do not come off while burnishing the work. The other important point is that a piece of turquoise inlaid work will be of more artistic value if the turquoise chips are installed more regularly in close contact, i.e. without a space in between.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19452">[[File:Pure screw.svg|thumb|A [[helix]] on a screw axis]]
A '''screw axis''' ('''helical axis''' or '''twist axis''') is a line that is simultaneously the axis of [[rotation]] and the line along which [[translation (geometry)|translation]] of a body occurs. [[Chasles' theorem (kinematics)|Chasles' theorem]] shows that each [[Euclidean group|Euclidean displacement]] in three-dimensional space has a screw axis, and the displacement can be decomposed into a rotation about and a slide along this screw axis.&lt;ref&gt;Bottema, O, and B. Roth, ''Theoretical Kinematics,'' Dover Publications (September 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=f8I4yGVi9ocC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false link to Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, K. H., ''Kinematic Geometry of Mechanism,'' Oxford University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plücker coordinates]] are used to locate a screw axis in [[cartesian space|space]], and consist of a pair of three-dimensional vectors. The first vector identifies the direction of the axis, and the second locates its position. The special case when the first vector is zero is interpreted as a pure translation in the direction of the second vector. A screw axis is associated with each pair of vectors in the algebra of screws, also known as [[screw theory]].&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Ball, A Treatise on the Theory of Screws, Hodges, Dublin, 1876, Appendix 1, University Press, Cambridge, 1900, p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;

The spatial movement of a body can be represented by a continuous set of displacements. Because each of these displacements has a screw axis, the movement has an associated ruled surface known as a ''screw surface''. This surface is not the same as the ''axode'', which is traced by the instantaneous screw axes of the movement of a body. The instantaneous screw axis, or 'instantaneous helical axis' (IHA), is the axis of the helicoidal field generated by the velocities of every point in a moving body.

When a spatial displacement specializes to a planar displacement, the screw axis becomes the ''displacement pole'', and the instantaneous screw axis becomes the ''velocity pole'', or [[instantaneous center of rotation]], also called an ''instant center''. The term ''centro'' is also used for a velocity pole, and the locus of these points for a planar movement is called a [[centrode]].&lt;ref&gt;Homer D. Eckhardt, '' Kinematic Design of Machines and Mechanisms'', McGraw-Hill (1998) p. 63 {{ISBN|0-07-018953-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=GGBv_Gcy5g8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false on-line at Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The proof that a spatial displacement can be decomposed into a rotation and slide around and along a line in space is attributed to [[Michel Chasles]] in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;M. Chasles, Note sur les Proprietes Generales du Systeme de Deux Corps Semblables entr'eux, Bullettin de Sciences Mathematiques, Astronomiques Physiques et Chimiques, Baron de Ferussac, Paris, 1830, pp. 321±326&lt;/ref&gt; Recently the work of Gulio Mozzi has been identified as presenting a similar result in 1763.&lt;ref&gt;G. Mozzi, Discorso matematico sopra il rotamento momentaneo dei corpi, Stamperia di Donato Campo, Napoli, 1763&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Ceccarelli, Screw axis defined by Giulio Mozzi in 1763 and early studies on helicoidal motion, Mechanism and Machine Theory 35 (2000) 761-770&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screw axis symmetry==
[[File:Coxeter helix.png|thumb|The [[Boerdijk–Coxeter helix]] is an example of a screw axis symmetry that is nonperiodic.]]
A '''screw displacement''' (also '''screw operation''' or '''rotary translation''') is the composition of a rotation by an angle ''φ'' about an axis (called the '''screw axis''') with a translation by a distance ''d'' along this axis. A positive rotation direction usually means one that corresponds to the translation direction by the [[right-hand rule]]. Except for ''φ'' = 180°, we have to distinguish a screw displacement from its [[mirror image]]. Unlike for rotations, a righthand and lefthand screw operation generate different groups.

The combination of a rotation about an axis and a translation in a perpendicular direction is a rotation about a parallel axis. However, a screw operation with a nonzero translation vector along the axis cannot be reduced like that. Thus the effect of a rotation combined with ''any'' translation is a screw operation in the general sense, with as special cases a pure translation, a pure rotation and the identity. Together these are all the direct [[Euclidean group#Overview of isometries in up to three dimensions|isometries in 3D]].

[[File:Te chains.png|thumb|200px|3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; screw axis in crystal structure of tellurium]]
In [[crystallography]], a '''screw axis symmetry''' is combination of rotation about an axis and a translation parallel to that axis leaves a crystal unchanged. If ''φ'' = 360°/''n'' for some positive integer ''n'', then screw axis symmetry implies [[translational symmetry]] with a translation vector which is ''n'' times that of the screw displacement.

Applicable for [[space group]]s is a rotation by 360°/''n'' about an axis, combined with a translation along the axis by a multiple of the distance of the translational symmetry, divided by ''n''. This multiple is indicated by a subscript. So, 6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a rotation of 60° combined with a translation of 1/2 of the lattice vector, implying that there is also 3-fold [[rotational symmetry]] about this axis. The possibilities are 2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 4&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 4&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and 6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and the enantiomorphous 3&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 4&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and 6&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Walter Borchardt-Ott | title=Crystallography | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1995 | isbn=3-540-59478-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-discrete screw axis [[isometry group]] contains all combinations of a rotation about some axis and a proportional translation along the axis (in [[rifling]], the constant of proportionality is called the [[twist rate]]); in general this is combined with ''k''-fold rotational isometries about the same axis (''k'' ≥ 1); the set of images of a point under the isometries is a ''k''-fold [[helix]]; in addition there may be a 2-fold rotation about a perpendicularly intersecting axis, and hence a ''k''-fold helix of such axes.

==Screw axis of a spatial displacement==

&lt;!-- ===Geometric argument===
Let f: '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; →'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; denote a rigid motion of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and let '''v''' denote an arbitrary vector of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Now let '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; denote the vector f('''0'''). We may now define the rigid motion rot: '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; →'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; via rot('''v''') := f('''v''') - '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for all '''v''' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This guarantees that rot('''0''') = '''0'''.

Since rot('''0''') = '''0''' (and being a motion of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, rot preserves orientation), rot must be a [[rotation]].

'''If''' rot is equal to the identity '''I''', then in this very simple case, the screw motion is merely translation by the original vector '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and does not involve a rotation. From here on we assume rot is not the identity '''I'''.

We know that each rotation of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; must have an axis (a bi-infinite straight line) that is pointwise fixed by the rotation. Call that line '''L'''.

Therefore the original rigid motion f satisfies rot('''v''') = f('''v''') - '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for all '''v''' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and hence
:f('''v''') = rot('''v''') + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
for all '''v''' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

This means that f is the result of applying a rotation rot, followed by a translation by '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

Finally, we may uniquely resolve the vector '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; into a sum of two vectors, one parallel to the line '''L''', and the other perpendicular to '''L''', as follows:
:'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''L'''&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''⊥'''&lt;/sub&gt;.

We may now add the translation vector '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; by first adding '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''⊥'''&lt;/sub&gt;, and next adding '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''L'''&lt;/sub&gt;, as follows:
:f('''v''') = (rot('''v''') + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''⊥'''&lt;/sub&gt;) + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''L'''&lt;/sub&gt;

Now, the first portion (rot('''v''') + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''⊥'''&lt;/sub&gt;) of f('''v''') may be thought of a taking place purely within any given plane '''P''' perpendicular to '''L''', where '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''⊥'''&lt;/sub&gt; is a vector in the plane '''P'''. In fact, define
:f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''v''') := rot('''v''') + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''⊥'''&lt;/sub&gt;, where both the rotation rot and the vector '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''⊥'''&lt;/sub&gt; are thought of as lying in the plane '''P'''.

Then, there is a unique point '''x''' in the plane '''P''' such that f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''') = rot('''x''') + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''⊥'''&lt;/sub&gt; = x. Or in other words, a unique point '''x''' in '''P''' that is fixed by the mapping f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

Since we want rot('''x''') + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''⊥'''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''x''', or in other words ('''I''' - rot)'''x''' = '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''⊥'''&lt;/sub&gt; (where '''I''' is the identity on '''P'''), we may easily solve this uniquely for '''x''' by writing
:'''x''' = ('''I''' - rot)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;('''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''⊥'''&lt;/sub&gt;).

This makes sense as long as ('''I''' - rot) is invertible, or in other words as long as rot is not equal to the identity '''I''', and we excluded that case above.

Since f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: '''P''' → '''P''' is a rigid motion of a plane with a fixed point ( f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''') = '''x'''), it must be a rotation of '''P'''.

Hence the effect on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of mapping any '''v''' to rot('''v''') + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''⊥'''&lt;/sub&gt; is just a rotation (by the same angle as rot) about the line '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that is parallel to '''L''', and passes through the point '''x'''.

Recall that he original rigid motion f on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is given by f('''v''') = (rot('''v''') + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''⊥'''&lt;/sub&gt;).

This implies that the original rigid motion f is the same as first rotating '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; about the line '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and following this by translation by the vector '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;'''L'''&lt;/sub&gt; (which is in the same direction as '''L'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).

Conclusion: every rigid motion of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the result of a rotation of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; followed by a translation along the axis of the rotation — which is the definition of a screw motion.
--&gt;
===Geometric argument===
Let {{nowrap|''D'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} be an orientation-preserving rigid motion of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The set of these transformations is a subgroup of [[Euclidean motion]]s known as the special Euclidean group SE(3). These rigid motions are defined by transformations of '''x''' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; given by
:&lt;math&gt; D(\mathbf{x})=A(\mathbf{x}) + \mathbf{d} &lt;/math&gt;
consisting of a three-dimensional rotation ''A'' followed by a translation by the vector '''d'''.

A three-dimensional [[rotation matrix|rotation]] ''A'' has a unique axis that defines a line ''L''. Let the unit vector along this line be '''S''' so that the translation vector '''d''' can be resolved into a sum of two vectors, one parallel and one perpendicular to the axis ''L'', that is,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{d}=\mathbf{d}_L + \mathbf{d}_{\perp},\quad \mathbf{d}_L =(\mathbf{d}\cdot\mathbf{S})\mathbf{S}, \quad \mathbf{d}_{\perp}=\mathbf{d}- \mathbf{d}_L.&lt;/math&gt;
In this case, the rigid motion takes the form
:&lt;math&gt; D(\mathbf{x})=(A(\mathbf{x}) + \mathbf{d}_{\perp}) + \mathbf{d}_L. &lt;/math&gt;

Now, the orientation preserving rigid motion ''D''* = ''A''('''x''') + '''d'''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt; transforms all the points of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; so that they remain in planes perpendicular to ''L''. For a rigid motion of this type there is a unique point '''c''' in the plane ''P'' perpendicular to ''L'' through '''0''', such that
:&lt;math&gt; D^*(\mathbf{C})=A(\mathbf{C})+\mathbf{d}_{\perp}=\mathbf{C}.&lt;/math&gt;
The point '''C''' can be calculated as
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C}=[I-A]^{-1}\mathbf{d}_{\perp},&lt;/math&gt;
because '''d'''&lt;sub&gt;⊥&lt;/sub&gt; does not have a component in the direction of the axis of ''A''.

A rigid motion ''D''* with a fixed point must be a rotation of around the axis ''L''&lt;sub&gt;'''c'''&lt;/sub&gt; through the point '''c'''. Therefore, the rigid motion
:&lt;math&gt; D(\mathbf{x})=D^*(\mathbf{x}) + \mathbf{d}_L,&lt;/math&gt;
consists of a rotation about the line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;'''c'''&lt;/sub&gt; followed by a translation by the vector '''d'''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; in the direction of the line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;'''c'''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Conclusion: every rigid motion of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the result of a rotation of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; about a line ''L''&lt;sub&gt;'''c'''&lt;/sub&gt; followed by a translation in the direction of the line. The combination of a rotation about a line and translation along the line is called a screw motion.

===Computing a point on the screw axis===
A point '''C''' on the screw axis satisfies the equation:&lt;ref name="McCarthy"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jv9mQyjRIw4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=geometric+design+of+linkages&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3L_5TcvZGaHV0QG2wMiDAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false J. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh, ''Geometric Design of Linkages'', 2nd Edition, Springer 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; D^*(\mathbf{C})=A(\mathbf{C})+\mathbf{d}_{\perp}=\mathbf{C}.&lt;/math&gt;
Solve this equation for '''C''' using [[rotation matrix#Skew parameters via Cayley's formula|Cayley's formula]] for a rotation matrix
:&lt;math&gt; [A]=[I-B]^{-1}[I+B],&lt;/math&gt;
where [B] is the skew-symmetric matrix constructed from [[rotation formalisms in three dimensions#Rodrigues parameters and Gibbs representation|Rodrigues' vector]]
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b}=\tan\frac{\phi}{2}\mathbf{S},&lt;/math&gt;
such that
:&lt;math&gt;[B]\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{y}.&lt;/math&gt;

Use this form of the rotation ''A'' to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C} =[I-B]^{-1}[I+B]\mathbf{C} + \mathbf{d}_{\perp},\quad [I-B]\mathbf{C} =[I+B]\mathbf{C} + [I-B]\mathbf{d}_{\perp},&lt;/math&gt;
which becomes
:&lt;math&gt; -2[B]\mathbf{C} =[I-B]\mathbf{d}_{\perp}.&lt;/math&gt;
This equation can be solved for '''C''' on the screw axis '''P'''(t) to obtain,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{C} = \frac{\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{d} - \mathbf{b}\times(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{d})}{2\mathbf{b}\cdot\mathbf{b}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The screw axis {{nowrap|1='''P'''(t) = '''C''' + t'''S'''}} of this spatial displacement has the [[Plücker coordinates]] {{nowrap|1=''S'' = ('''S''', '''C''' × '''S''')}}.&lt;ref name="McCarthy"/&gt;

==Dual quaternion==
The screw axis appears in the [[dual quaternion]] formulation of a spatial displacement {{nowrap|1=D = ([A], '''d''')}}. The dual quaternion is constructed from the [[screw theory|dual vector]] {{nowrap|1=S = ('''S''', '''V''')}} defining the screw axis and the dual angle {{nowrap|(''φ'', ''d'')}}, where ''φ'' is the rotation about and ''d'' the slide along this axis, which defines the displacement D to obtain,
:&lt;math&gt; \hat{S} = \cos\frac{\hat{\varphi}}{2} + \sin\frac{\hat{\varphi}}{2} \mathsf{S}. &lt;/math&gt;

A spatial displacement of points '''q''' represented as a vector quaternion can be defined using [[quaternion]]s as the mapping
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{q} \mapsto S\mathbf{q}S^{-1} + \mathbf{d}&lt;/math&gt;
where '''d''' is translation vector quaternion and ''S'' is a unit quaternion, also called a [[versor]], given by
:&lt;math&gt;S=\cos \theta + \mathbf{S} \sin \theta , \ \ \mathbf{S}^2 = -1 ,&lt;/math&gt;
that defines a rotation by 2''θ'' around an axis '''S'''.

In the proper [[Euclidean group]] E&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(3) a rotation may be [[conjugacy class|conjugated]] with a translation to move it to a parallel rotation axis. Such a conjugation, using [[quaternion analysis#Homographies|quaternion homographies]], produces the appropriate screw axis to express the given spatial displacement as a screw displacement, in accord with [[Chasles' theorem (kinematics)|Chasles’ theorem]].

==Mechanics==
The motion of a [[rigid body]] may be the combination of rotation about an axis (the screw axis) and a translation along that axis. This screw move is characterized by the velocity vector for the translation and the [[angular velocity]] vector in the same or opposite direction. If these two vectors are constant and along one of the [[moment of inertia#Inertia tensor|principal axes]] of the body, no external forces are needed for this motion (moving and [[spin (physics)|spinning]]). As an example, if gravity and drag are ignored, this is the motion of a [[bullet]] fired from a [[rifling|rifled]] [[gun]].

===Biomechanics===
This parameter is often used in [[biomechanics]], when describing the motion of [[joint]]s of the body. For any period of time, joint motion can be seen as the movement of a single point on one articulating surface with respect to the adjacent surface (usually [[anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] with respect to [[anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]]). The total translation and rotations along the path of motion can be defined as the time integrals of the instantaneous translation and rotation velocities at the IHA for a given reference time.&lt;ref&gt;Woltring HJ, de Lange A, Kauer JMG, Huiskes R. 1987 Instantaneous helical axes estimation via natural, cross-validated splines. In: Bergmann G, Kölbel R, Rohlmann A (Editors). Biomechanics: Basic and Applied Research. Springer, pp 121-128. [http://library.tue.nl/csp/dare/LinkToRepository.csp?recordnumber=587036 full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

In any single [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], the path formed by the locations of the moving instantaneous axis of rotation (IAR) is known as the 'centroid', and is used in the description of joint motion.
&lt;!----duplicated above ==Crystallography==
[[File:Te chains.png|thumb|200px|3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; screw axis in crystal structure of tellurium]]
In [[crystallography]], a '''screw axis''' is a symmetry operation describing how a combination of rotation about an axis and a translation parallel to that axis leaves a crystal unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Walter Borchardt-Ott | title=Crystallography | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1995 | isbn=3-540-59478-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screw axes are noted by a number, ''n'', where the angle of rotation is 360°/''n''. The degree of translation is then added as a subscript showing how far along the axis the translation is, as a portion of the parallel lattice vector. For example, 2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a 180° (twofold) rotation followed by a translation of 1/2 of the lattice vector. 3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a 120° (threefold) rotation followed by a translation of 1/3 of the lattice vector. The possible screw axes are 2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 4&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 4&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and 6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and the [[chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphous]] 3&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 4&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and 6&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''''Shibui''''' (渋い) (adjective), '''''shibumi''''' (渋み) (noun), or '''''shibusa''''' (渋さ) (noun) are [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words which refer to a particular aesthetic of simple, subtle, and unobtrusive [[beauty]].&lt;ref name="HussainWilkinson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr. Mazhar Hussain|author2=Robert Wilkinson|title=The Pursuit of Comparative Aesthetics: An Interface Between East and West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Wez4pgWp3AC&amp;pg=PA227|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5345-5|pages=227–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other [[Japanese aesthetics]] terms, such as ''[[Iki (aesthetic ideal)|iki]]'' and ''[[wabi-sabi]]'', ''shibui'' can apply to a wide variety of subjects, not just art or fashion.&lt;ref name="De_Garis2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=De Garis|title=We Japanese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUm0AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15|date=5 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-18367-6|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shibusa is an enriched, subdued appearance or experience of intrinsically fine quality with economy of form, line, and effort, producing a timeless tranquility.  Shibusa includes the following essential qualities: 
* Shibui objects appear to be simple overall but they include subtle details, such as textures, that balance simplicity with complexity.  
* This balance of simplicity and complexity ensures that one does not tire of a shibui object but constantly finds new meanings and enriched beauty that cause its aesthetic value to grow over the years.&lt;ref name="Lim2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sunamita Lim|title=Japanese Style: Designing with Nature's Beauty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsWemDyPlE4C&amp;pg=PA41|year=2007|publisher=Gibbs Smith|isbn=978-1-4236-0092-3|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shibusa walks a fine line between contrasting aesthetic concepts such as elegant and rough or spontaneous and restrained.&lt;ref name="Lebra1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Takie Sugiyama Lebra|title=Japanese Patterns of Behaviour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWG07rhiyUMC&amp;pg=PA20|year=1976|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-0460-2|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colors of shibusa are "muddy" colors.&lt;ref name="De_Garis2013"/&gt; For example, in interior decorating and painting, gray is added to primary colors to create a silvery effect that ties the different colors together into a coordinated scheme.  Depending upon how much gray is added, shibui colors range from pastels to dark. Occasionally, a patch of brighter color is added as a highlight.

[[File:Shibusa modesty wiki.jpg|thumb|right|"Shibusa Modesty" iron glaze vase, Dorothy Bearnson, 1988.]]
Shibusa is not to be confused with wabi or sabi.  Though many wabi or sabi objects are shibui, not all shibui objects are wabi or sabi. Wabi or sabi objects can be more severe and sometimes exaggerate intentional imperfections to such an extent that they can appear to be artificial. Shibui objects are not necessarily imperfect or asymmetrical, though they can include these qualities. 

The seven elements of shibusa are simplicity, implicity, modesty, naturalness, everydayness, imperfection, and silence.  They are adapted from the concepts authored by Dr. Soetsu Yanagi (1898–1961), aesthetician and museum curator, published in the Japanese magazine ''Kogei'' between 1930–1940. The aristocratic simplicity of shibusa is the refined expression of the essence of elements in an aesthetic experience producing quietude. Spare elegance is evident in darkling serenity with a hint of sparkle.  Implicity allows depth of feeling to be visible through spare surface design thereby manifesting the invisible core that offers new meanings with each encounter.  The person of shibui modesty exalts excellence via taking time to learn, watch, read, understand, develop, think, and merges into understatement and silence concerning oneself.  Naturalness conveys spontaneity in unforced growth.  Shibusa freedom is maintained in healthy roughness of texture and irregular asymmetrical form wherein the center lies beyond all particular things, in infinity. Everydayness raises ordinary things to a place of honor, void of all artificial and unnecessary properties, thus imparting spiritual joy—for today is more auspicious than tomorrow.  Everydayness provides a framework, a tradition for an artist's oeuvre to be a unit not a process.  Hiroshi Mizuo argues that the best examples of shibusa are found in the crafts, ordinary objects made for everyday use. They tend to be more spontaneous and healthy than many of the fine arts.  Imperfection is illustrated in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s gothic novel, ''The Marble Faun''.  The chapter "An Aesthetic Company" mentions some ragged and ill-conditioned antique drawings and their attributions and virtues.

Imperfection in shibusa Sōetsu Yanagi in ''[[The Unknown Craftsman]]'' refers to as "beauty with inner implications".  Creation here means making a piece that will lead the viewer to draw beauty from it for oneself.  Shibui beauty in Tea Ceremony is in the artistry of the viewer.

Shibusa's sanctuary of silence is non-dualism—the resolution of opposites. Its foundation is intuition coupled with faith and beauty revealing phases of truth and the worship and reverence for life.

In [[James A. Michener]]'s book ''[[Iberia (book)|Iberia]]'' the adjective 'shibui' is referenced as follows: "The Japanese have a word which summarizes all the best in Japanese life, yet it has no explanation and cannot be translated. It is the word ''shibui'', and the best approximation to its meaning is 'acerbic good taste.'" The author Trevanian (the nom de plume of Dr. Rodney William Whitaker) wrote in his 1979 best-selling
novel ''[[Shibumi (novel)|Shibumi]]'', "Shibumi has to do with great refinement underlying commonplace appearances." In the [[business fable]] ''[[The Shibumi Strategy]]'', the author, [[Matthew E. May]], wrote that shibumi "has come to denote those things that exhibit in paradox and all at once the very best of everything and nothing: Elegant simplicity. Effortless effectiveness. Understated excellence. Beautiful imperfection."
  
Shibui, a registration or 'felt sense' of evolving perfection.  What is being registered is the 'Life' behind the qualities of any experience.  A 'felt sense' of qualities, such as, quiet beauty with intelligence, love, light, and joy.  These qualities can be more easily registered when quietly viewing simple, natural everyday phenomenon or objects, such as a sunrise or a simple piece of pottery.  Shibui can sometimes be more easily registered by two people in a meditative state (quiet in their emotions and their minds) while viewing the same phenomenon or object. For example, when viewing the same sunset or piece of art, subconsciously, both people register the qualities of the 'Life' or implicity underlying the experience or object; this registration of the underlying 'Life' precipitates into the conscious as registering something 'extraordinary' in the everyday 'ordinary'.  If you both register, then looking into the other person's eyes, you understand that you both shared the same phenomenon, a 'knowing' of the underlying 'Life', or at least the qualities of that underlying 'Life'.  The qualities registered can seem paradoxical. Complex experiences or objects seem simple; perfection is found in imperfection.  All objects and experiences, both everyday and extraordinary, can have a beauty, a quiet purposeful intent, a cool 'matter of fact' underlying joy.

Potters, musicians, painters, bonsai and other artists often work to bring in 'Shibui-like' qualities into their art.  A few go behind these qualities to bring the underlying 'Life' into their art.  Expert singers, actors, potters, and artists of all other sorts were often said to be ''shibui''; their expertise caused them to do things beautifully without making them excessive or gaudy. Today, sometimes baseball players are even said to be ''shibui'' when they contribute to the overall success of the team without doing anything to make themselves stand out individually. The apparent effortlessness displayed by athletes such as tennis player Roger Federer and hockey great Wayne Gretzky are examples of shibumi in personal performance. Shibui, and its underlying 'Life', is found in all art and in everything around us—including ourselves.  Taking the path to understand and experience Shibui, is a step towards understanding and consciously registering the 'Life' underlying all.

==History of the term==
[[File:Diospyros kaki Frucht.jpg|thumb|right|An almost ripe ''Shibui'', the fruit of ''[[Diospyros kaki]]'']]
Originating in the [[Muromachi period]] (1336–1573) as ''shibushi'', the term originally referred to a sour or astringent taste, such as that of an unripe [[persimmon]].&lt;ref name="HussainWilkinson2006"/&gt; ''Shibui'' maintains that literal meaning still, and remains the antonym of amai (甘い), meaning 'sweet'.

However, by the beginnings of the [[Edo period]] (1615–1868), the term had gradually begun to refer to a pleasing aesthetic. The people of Edo expressed their tastes in using this term to refer to anything from song to fashion to craftsmanship that was beautiful by being understated, or by being precisely what it was meant to be and not elaborated upon. Essentially, the aesthetic ideal of ''shibumi'' seeks out events, performances, people or objects that are beautiful in a direct and simple way, without being flashy.

Soetsu Yanagi work as translated by Bernard Leach in ''[[The Unknown Craftsman]]'' discusses shibumi.

The concept of ''shibusa'' was introduced to the West in August and September, 1960, in publications of the American magazine ''[[House Beautiful]]''.

'''Spanish art'''  has been an important contributor to [[Western art history|Western art]] and Spain has produced many famous and influential artists including [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Francisco Goya|Goya]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]. Spanish art was particularly influenced by Italy and France  during the [[Baroque]] and [[neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] periods, but Spanish art has often had very distinctive characteristics, partly explained by the [[Moors|Moorish]] heritage in Spain (especially in [[Andalusia]]), and through the political and cultural climate in Spain during the [[Counter-Reformation]] and the subsequent eclipse of Spanish power under the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasty.

The [[prehistoric art]] of Spain had many important periods-it was one of the main centres of European [[Upper Paleolithic art]] and the [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin|rock art of the Spanish Levant]] in the subsequent periods. In the [[Iron Age]] north-western Spain was a centre for [[Celtic art]], and [[Iberian sculpture]] has a distinct style, partly influenced by coastal Greek settlements.  Spain was conquered by the Romans by 200 BC and Rome was rather smoothly replaced by the Germanic [[Visigoth]]s in the 5th century AD, who represented only a small ruling class, who soon Christianized.  The relatively few remains of [[Visigothic art and architecture]] show an attractive and distinct version of wider European trends, but the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Muslim conquest of most of Spain]] in the 8th century was a massive disruption and transformation. Over the following centuries the wealthy courts of [[Al-Andaluz]] produced many works of exceptional quality, culminating in the [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]], right at the end of Muslim Spain.

Meanwhile, the parts of Spain remaining Christian, or that were [[Reconquista|re-conquered]], were prominent in [[Pre-Romanesque]] and [[Romanesque art]], especially in [[Catalonia]]. Late Gothic Spanish art flourished under the unified monarchy in the [[Isabelline Gothic]] and [[Plateresque]] styles, and the already strong traditions in painting and sculpture began to benefit from the influence of imported Italian artists. The enormous wealth that followed the flood of American gold saw lavish spending on the arts in Spain, much of it directed at religious art in the [[Counter-Reformation]].  Spanish control of the leading centre of North European art, [[Flanders]], from 1483 and also of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] from 1548, both ending in 1714, had a great influence on Spanish art, and the level of spending attracted artists from other areas, such as [[El Greco]], [[Rubens]] and (from a safe distance) [[Titian]] in the [[Spanish Golden Age]], as well as great native painters such as [[Diego Velázquez]], [[José de Ribera]], [[Francisco Zurbarán]] and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]].

[[Spanish Baroque architecture]] has survived in large quantity, and has both strains marked by exuberant extravagance, as in the [[Churrigueresque]] style, and a rather severe classicism, as in the work of [[Juan de Herrera]]. It was generally the former which marked the emerging art and [[Spanish Colonial architecture]] of the [[Spanish Empire]] outside Europe, as in Latin America ([[New Spanish Baroque]] and [[Andean Baroque]]), while the [[Baroque Churches of the Philippines]] are simpler.  
The decline of the Habsburg monarchy brought this period to an end, and Spanish art in the 18th and early-19th century was generally less exciting, with the huge exception of Francisco Goya. The rest of 19th-century Spanish art followed European trends, generally at a conservative pace, until the Catalan movement of [[Modernisme]], which initially was more a form of [[Art Nouveau]].  Picasso dominates Spanish [[Modernism]] in the usual English sense, but [[Juan Gris]], [[Salvador Dalí]] and [[Joan Miró]] are other leading figures.

==Ancient Iberia==
[[File:Torralba.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Talaiotic culture|Talaiotic]] town of Torralba den Salord site, [[Menorca|Menorca island]]]]
The early [[Iberians]] have left many remains; northern-western Spain shares with south-western France the region where the richest [[Upper Paleolithic art]] in Europe is found in the [[Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art of Northern Spain|Cave of Altamira and other sites]] where there are [[cave painting]]s made between 35,000 and 11,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;some are as old as 40,800 years old, according to "U-series dating of Paleolithic art in 11 caves in Spain", ''Science'', 2012 Jun 15 ;336(6087):1409-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]] (as [[UNESCO]] term it) is from the eastern side of Spain, probably dating from about 8000-3500 BC, and shows animal and hunting scenes often developed with a growing feeling for the whole composition of a large scene.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Portugal]] in particular is rich in [[megalithic]] monuments, including the [[Almendres Cromlech]], and [[Iberian schematic art]] is stone sculpture, [[petroglyph]]s and [[cave painting]]s from the early metal ages, found all over the Iberian peninsula, with both geometric patterns, but also a higher usage of simple [[pictogram]]-like human figures than is typical of comparable art from other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Casco de Leiro]], a late [[Bronze Age]] gold ritual helmet, may relate to other [[golden hats]] found in Germany, and the [[Treasure of Villena]] is a huge hoard of geometrically decorated vessels and jewellery, perhaps from the 10th century BC, including 10 kilos of gold.

[[Iberian sculpture]] before the Roman occupation reflects the contacts with other advanced ancient cultures who set up small coastal colonies, including the Greeks and [[Phoenicians]]; the [[Sa Caleta Phoenician Settlement]] on [[Ibiza]] has survived to be excavated, where most now lie under large towns, and the [[Lady of Guardamar]] was excavated from another Phoenician site. The [[Lady of Elche]] (probably 4th century BC) possibly represents [[Tanit]], but also shows [[Hellenistic]] influence, as do the 6th century [[Sphinx of Agost]] and [[Biche of Balazote]]. The [[Bulls of Guisando]] are the most impressive examples of ''[[verraco]]s'', which are large [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] animal sculptures in stone; the 5th century BC [[Bull of Osuna]] is a more developed single example. Some decorated ''[[falcata]]'', the distinctive curving Iberian sword, have survived, and large numbers of bronze [[statuettes]] used as [[votive offering]]s.  The Romans gradually conquered all of Iberia between 218 BC and 19 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 13-21&lt;/ref&gt;

As elsewhere in the Western Empire, the Roman occupation largely overwhelmed native styles; Iberia was an important agricultural area for the Romans, and the elite acquired vast estates producing [[wheat]], [[olive]]s and wine, with some later emperors coming from the Iberian provinces; many huge villas have been excavated.  The [[Aqueduct of Segovia]], [[Roman Walls of Lugo]], [[Alcántara Bridge]] (104–106 AD), and the [[Tower of Hercules]] lighthouse are among a number of well-preserved major monuments, impressive remains of [[Roman engineering]] if not always art. [[Roman temple]]s survive fairly complete at [[Roman temple of Vic|Vic]], [[Roman Temple of Évora|Évora]] (now in Portugal), and [[Roman temple of Alcántara|Alcántara]], as well as elements in [[Temple of Augustus in Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Roman temple of Córdoba|Córdoba]].  There must have been local workshops producing the high-quality [[mosaic]]s found, though most of the better free-standing sculpture was probably imported.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 21-28&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Missorium of Theodosius I]] is an important [[Late Antique]] silver dish that was found in Spain but was probably made in [[Constantinople]].

== Early Medieval ==
[[File:CoronaRecesvinto01.JPG|thumb|right|230px|Detail of the [[votive crown]] of [[Recceswinth|Reccesuinth]], from the [[Treasure of Guarrazar]], now in Madrid. The hanging letters spell  [R]ECCESVINTUS REX OFFERET [King R. offers this].&lt;ref&gt;The first R is held at the [[Musée de Cluny]], Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Christianized [[Visigoths]] ruled Iberia after the collapse of the Empire, and the rich 7th century [[Treasure of Guarrazar]], probably deposited to avoid looting in the [[Muslim Conquest of Spain]], is now a unique survival of Christian [[votive crown]]s in gold; though Spanish in style, the form was probably then used by elites across Europe. Other [[Visigothic art]] in the form of metalwork, mostly jewellery and buckles, and stone [[relief]]s, survives to give an idea of the culture of this originally barbarian Germanic people, who kept themselves very largely separate from their Iberian subjects, and whose rule crumbled when the Muslims arrived in 711.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 29-33&lt;/ref&gt;

The jewelled ''[[crux gemmata]]'' [[Victory Cross]], [[La Cava Bible]] and the [[Agate Casket of Oviedo]] are survivals from the 9-10th century of the rich [[Pre-Romanesque]] culture of the [[Asturias]] region in north-western Spain, which remained under Christian rule; the [[Santa María del Naranco]] banqueting house overlooking [[Oviedo]], completed in 848 and later surviving as a church, is a unique survival in Europe. The [[Codex Vigilanus]], completed in 976 in the region of [[La Rioja (Spain)|Rioja]], shows a complex mixture of several styles.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 59-61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muslim and Mozarab Spain==
[[File:Decoración de Medina Azahara (Córdoba, España).jpg|thumb|left|260px|[[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] panel from [[Medina Azahara]], [[province of Córdoba, Spain|province of Córdoba]]]]
The extraordinary palace-city of [[Medina Azahara]] near [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] was built in the 10th century for the [[Ummayads|Ummayad]] [[Caliphs of Córdoba]], intended as the capital of Islamic [[Andaluz]], and is still being excavated.  A considerable amount of the highly sophisticated decoration of the main buildings has survived, showing the enormous wealth of this very centralized state.  The palace at [[Aljafería]] is later, from after Islamic Spain split into a number of kingdoms.  Famous examples of [[Islamic architecture]] and its decoration are the [[Cathedral–Mosque of Córdoba]], whose Islamic elements were added in stages between 784 and 987, and the [[Alhambra]] and [[Generalife]] palaces in [[Granada]] from the final periods of Muslim Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 34-42, 47-51&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pisa Griffin]] is the largest known Islamic sculpture of an animal, and the most spectacular of a group of such figures from Al-Andalus, many made to hold up the basins of fountains (as at the Alhambra), or in smaller cases as perfume-burners and the like.

The Christian population of Muslim Spain (the Mozarabs) developed a style of [[Mozarabic art]] whose best known survivals are a series of [[illuminated manuscript]]s, several of the commentaries on the [[Book of Revelation]] by the Asturian Saint [[Beatus of Liébana]] (c. 730 – c. 800), which gave subject matter that allowed the brightly coloured primitivist style full scope to demonstrate its qualities in manuscripts of the 10th century like the  [[Morgan Beatus]], probably the earliest, the [[Gerona Beatus]] (illuminated by a female artist [[Ende (artist)|Ende]]), [[Escorial Beatus]] and the [[Saint-Sever Beatus]], which was actually produced some distance from Muslim rule in France.  Mozarabic elements, including a background of brightly coloured strips, can be seen in some later Romanesque frescos.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 53-59, 86&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hispano-Moresque ware]] pottery began in the south, presumably mainly for local markets, but Muslim potters were later encouraged to migrate to the [[Valencia]] region, where the Christian lords marketed their luxury [[lustreware]]s to elites all over Christian Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries, including the Popes and the English court.  Spanish Islamic [[ivory carving]] and textiles were also very fine; the continuing industries producing tiles and carpets in the peninsula owe their origins largely to the Islamic kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 43-44, 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;

After the expulsion of the Islamic rulers during the [[Reconquista]], considerable Muslim populations, and Christian craftsmen trained in Muslim styles, remained in Spain, and [[Mudéjar]] is the term for work in art and architecture produced by such people.  The [[Mudéjar Architecture of Aragon]] is recognised as a [[UNESCO World Heritage site]], and the 14th century ''Patio de las Doncellas'' built for [[Peter of Castile]] in the [[Alcázar of Seville]] is another outstanding example.  The style could harmonize well with Christian European medieval and Renaissance styles, for example in elaborate wood and [[stucco]] ceilings, and Mudéjar work often continued to be produced for some centuries after an area passed to Christian rule.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol, 188-197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==

===Romanesque===
[[File:Santa maria tahull abside.jpg|thumb|The apse of [[Master of Taüll|Santa Maria Taüll]] church, a Catalan fresco from [[Vall de Boí]], [[province of Lleida]], early 12th century. Now in the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]].]]

In Spain, the art of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period represented a smooth transition from the preceding Pre-Romanesque and Mozarabic styles. Many of the best surviving Romanesque church [[frescos]] that were at the time found all over Europe come from [[Catalonia]] with good examples in the churches of the [[Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Boí|Vall de Boí]] area; many of these were only uncovered during the 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;Walter W. S. Cook, ''Romanesque Spanish Mural Painting (I)'' from ''The Art Bulletin'', Vol. 11, No.4, Dec 1929, accessed from JSTOR:[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3050749]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the best examples have been moved to museums, especially the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya]] in [[Barcelona]], which has the famous [[Master of Taüll|Central Apse from Sant Climent in Taüll]] and the frescos from [[Sigena]].  The finest examples of [[Castile (historical region)|Castillian]] Romanesque frescoes are considered to be those in the [[Basilica of San Isidoro|San Isidoro]] in [[León, Spain|Leon]], the paintings from [[San Baudelio de Berlanga]], now mostly in various museums including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and those from [[Santa Cruz de Maderuelo]] in [[Segovia]].&lt;ref&gt;The Prado Guide, pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also a number of [[altar frontal]]s painted on wood and other early [[panel painting]]s.

===Gothic===
The Gothic art of Spain represented a gradual development from previous Romanesque styles, being led by external models, first from France, and then later from Italy. Another distinctive aspect was the incorporation of [[Mudejar]] elements. Eventually the Italian influence, which transmitted Byzantine stylistic techniques and [[iconography]], entirely displaced the initial Franco-Gothic style&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Catalonia continued to be a prosperous area which has left many fine [[altarpiece]]s; however the region went into decline after the emphasis of trade moved to the Atlantic after the American colonies opened up, which partly accounts for so many medieval survivals there, as there was not the money for Renaissance and Baroque renovations to churches.

===Early Renaissance===
Due to important economic and political links between Spain and Flanders from the mid-15th century onwards, the early Renaissance in Spain was heavily influenced by [[Early Netherlandish painting|Netherlandish painting]], leading to the identification of a [[Hispano-Flemish painting|Hispano-Flemish]] school of painters. Leading exponents included [[Fernando Gallego]], [[Bartolomé Bermejo]], [[Pedro Berruguete]] and [[Juan de Flandes]].

===Renaissance and Mannerism===
[[File:Luis de Morales - Pietà.jpg|thumb|left|''Pietà'', by [[Luis de Morales]]. [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]], Seville.]]
Overall the Renaissance and subsequent Mannerist styles are hard to categorise in Spain, due to the mix of Flemish and Italian influences, and regional variations.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

The main centre for Italian Renaissance influence entering Spain was [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] due to its proximity and close links with Italy. This influence was felt via then import of artworks, including four paintings by [[Piombo]] and many prints by [[Raphael]], the arrival of the Italian Renaissance artist [[Paolo de San Leocadio]],&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; and also by Spanish artists who spent time working and training there. Such artists included [[Fernando Yáñez de la Almedina]] (1475&amp;ndash;1540) and [[Hernando de los Llanos|Fernando Llanos]], who displayed [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonadesque]] features in their works, such as delicate, melancholic expressions, and [[sfumato]] modelling of features.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in Spain, the influence of the Italian Renaissance was less pure, with a relatively superficial use of techniques that were combined with preceding Flemish practices and incorporated [[Mannerist]] features, due the relatively late examples from Italy, once Italian art was already strongly Mannerist.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from technical aspects, the themes and spirit of the Renaissance were modified to the Spanish culture and religious environment. Consequently, very few classical subjects or female nudes were depicted, and the works frequently exhibited a sense of pious devotion and religious intensity – attributes that would remain dominant in much art of [[Counter Reformation]] Spain throughout the 17th century, and beyond.
artists included [[Vicente Juan Masip]] (1475&amp;ndash;1550) and his son [[Juan de Juanes]] (1510&amp;ndash;1579), the painter and architect [[Pedro Machuca]] (1490&amp;ndash;1550), and [[Juan Correa de Vivar]] (1510&amp;ndash;1566).
However, the most popular Spanish painter of the early 17th Century was [[Luis de Morales]] (1510?–1586), called by his contemporaries "The Divine", because of the religious intensity of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;The Prado Guide, pg. 48&lt;/ref&gt; From the Renaissance he also frequently used sfumato modeling, and simple compositions, but combined them with Flemish style precision of details. His subjects included many devotional images, including the ''Virgin and Child''.

=== Golden Age ===
[[File:Murillo immaculate conception.jpg|thumb|upright| [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]], ''Immaculate Conception of the Virgin (Soult)''. Museo del Prado.]]
The [[Spanish Golden Age]], a period of Spanish political ascendancy and subsequent decline, saw a great development of art in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brown, ''The Golden Age of Painting in Spain''. New Haven: Yale University Press 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The period is generally considered to have begun at some point after 1492 and ended by or with the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] in 1659, though in art the start is delayed until the reign of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]] (1598-1621), or just before, and the end also delayed until the 1660s or later.  The style thus forms a part of the wider [[Baroque]] period in art, although as well as considerable influence from great Baroque masters such as [[Caravaggio]] and later [[Rubens]], the distinctive nature of the art of the period also included influences that modified typical Baroque characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;José Antonio Maravall, ''Culture of the Baroque: Analysis of a Historical Structure''. Minneapolis MN 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  These included influence from contemporary [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and the native Spanish tradition which give much of the art of the period an interest in naturalism, and an avoidance of the grandiosity of much Baroque art.  Important early contributors included [[Juan Bautista Maíno]] (1569&amp;ndash;1649), who brought a new naturalistic style into Spain,&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 64&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco Ribalta]] (1565&amp;ndash;1628),&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 74&lt;/ref&gt; and the influential [[still life]] painter, [[Juan Sánchez Cotán|Sánchez Cotán]] (1560&amp;ndash;1627).&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[El Greco]] (1541&amp;ndash;1614) was one of the most individualistic of the painters of the period,  developing a strongly Mannerist style based on his origins in the post [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[Cretan school]], in contrast to the naturalist approaches then predominant in Seville, Madrid and elsewhere in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 54&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his works reflect the silvery-greys and strong colours of Venetian painters such as [[Titian]], but combined with strange elongations of figures, unusual lighting, disposing of perspective space, and filling the surface with very visible and expressive brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mostly active in Italy, particularly in Naples, [[José de Ribera]] (1591&amp;ndash;1652) considered himself Spanish, and his style is sometimes used as an example of the extremes of Counter-Reformation Spanish art. His work was very influential (largely through the circulation of his drawing and prints throughout Europe) and developed significantly through his career.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 76, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Being the gateway to the [[New World]], [[Seville]] became the cultural centre of Spain in the 16th Century, and attracted artists from across Europe, drawn by lure of commissions for the growing empire, and for the numerous religious houses of the wealthy city.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 84&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from a strongly Flemish tradition of detailed and smooth brushwork, as revealed in the works of [[Francisco Pacheco]] (1564&amp;ndash;1642), over time a more naturalistic approach developed, with the influence of [[Juan de las Roelas|Juan de Roelas]] (c. 1560&amp;ndash;1624) and [[Francisco Herrera the Elder]] (1590&amp;ndash;1654). This more naturalistic approach, influenced by [[Caravaggio]], became predominant in Seville, and formed the training background of three Golden Age masters: Cano, Zurbarán and Velázquez.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 84&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francisco Zurbarán]] (1598&amp;ndash;1664) is known for the forceful, realistic use of [[chiaroscuro]] in his religious paintings and [[still life]]s. Although seen as limited in his development, and struggling to handle complex scenes. Zurbarán's great ability to evoke religious feelings made him very successful in receiving commissions in conservative Counter-Reformation Seville.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharing the same painting master - Francisco Pacheco - as Velázquez, [[Alonso Cano]] (16601&amp;ndash;1667) was also active in sculpture and architecture. His style moved from the naturalism of his early period, to a more delicate, idealistic approach, revealing [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian]] and [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pg 90&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Velázquez ===
[[File:Las Meninas, by Diego Velázquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|[[Diego Velázquez]], ''[[Las Meninas]],'' 1656–57. Museo del Prado.]]
[[Diego Velázquez]] (1599–1660) was the leading artist in the court of King [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]. In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance, he created scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family, other notable European figures, and commoners. In many portraits, Velázquez gave a dignified quality to less fortunate members of society like beggars and dwarfs. In contrast to these portraits, the gods and goddesses of Velázquez tend to be portrayed as common people, without divine characteristics. Besides the forty portraits of Philip by Velázquez, he painted portraits of other members of the royal family, including princes, infantas (princesses), and queens.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brown, ''Velázquez: Painter and Courtier''. New Haven: Yale University Press 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later Baroque ===
[[File:'Still Life with Oranges, Jars, and Boxes of Sweets', by Luis Meléndez.jpg|thumb|px|upright| ''Still Life with Oranges, Jars, and Boxes of Sweets'', by [[Luis Egidio Meléndez]]]]
Later Baroque elements were introduced as a foreign influence, through visits to Spain by [[Rubens]], and the circulation of artists and patrons between Spain and the Spanish possessions of [[Naples]] and the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. Significant Spanish painters taking up the new style were [[Juan Carreño de Miranda]] (1614&amp;ndash;1685), [[Francisco Rizi]] (1614&amp;ndash;1685) and [[Francisco de Herrera the Younger]] (1627&amp;ndash;1685), son of [[Francisco de Herrera]] the Elder an initiator of the naturalist emphasis of the [[Seville School]]. Other notable Baroque painters were [[Claudio Coello]] (1642&amp;ndash;1693), [[Antonio de Pereda]] (1611&amp;ndash;1678), [[Mateo Cerezo]] (1637&amp;ndash;1666) and [[Juan de Valdés Leal]] (1622&amp;ndash;1690).&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 132-139&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-eminent painter of the period - and most famous Spanish painter prior to the 19th century appreciation of Velázquez, Zurbarán and El Greco - was [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]] (1617&amp;ndash;1682).&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Working for most of his career in Seville, his early work reflected the naturalism of Caravaggio, using a subdued, brown palette, simple but not harsh lighting,  and religious themes that are portrayed in a natural or domestic setting, as in his ''Holy Family with a Little Bird '' (c. 1650).&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Later he incorporated elements of the [[Flemish Baroque]] from Rubens and Van Dyck. In the ''Soult Immaculate Conception'', a brighter and more radiant colour range is used, the swirling cherubs bringing all the focus upon the Virgin, whose heavenward gaze and diffuse and warmly glowing halo make it an effective devotional image, an important component of his output; the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin theme alone was represented about twenty times by Murillo.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===18th century ===
The beginning of the [[Bourbon dynasty]] in Spain under [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] led to great changes in art patronage, with the new French-oriented court favoring the styles and artists of Bourbon France. Few Spanish painters were employed by the court – a rare exception being [[Miguel Jacinto Meléndez]] (1679–1734) – and it took some time before Spanish painters adapted to the new [[Rococo]]  and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] styles. Leading European painters, including [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], were active and influential.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Restricted from royal sponsorship, many Spanish painters continued the Baroque style in religious compositions. This was true of [[Francisco Bayeu y Subias]] (1734–1795), a skilled fresco painter, and of [[Mariano Salvador Maella]] (1739–1819) who both developed in the direction of the severe Neoclassicism of Mengs.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 150–151&lt;/ref&gt; Another important avenue for Spanish artists was portraiture, which was an active sphere for [[Antonio González Velázquez]] (1723–1794), [[Joaquín Inza y Ainsa|Joaquín Inza]] (1736–1811) and [[Agustín Esteve]] (1753–1820).&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; But it is in the genre of the still life that royal patronage was also successfully found, in the works by artists such as the court painter [[Bartolomé Montalvo]] (1769–1846)&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Luis Egidio Meléndez]] (1716–1780).

Continuing in the Spanish still life tradition of [[Juan Sánchez Cotán|Sánchez Cotán]] and Zurbarán, Meléndez produced a series of cabinet paintings, commissioned by the [[Prince of Asturias]], the future [[Charles IV of Spain|King Charles IV]], intended to show the full range of edible foods from Spain. Rather than being merely formal studies in Natural History, he used stark lighting, low viewpoints and severe compositions to dramatise the subjects. He showed great interest and attention to the details of reflections, textures and highlights (such the highlight on the patterned vase in ''Still Life with Oranges, Jars, and Boxes of Sweets'') reflecting the new spirit of the age of [[Enlightenment in Spain|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 154-155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goya ===
[[File:The rape of Europa, Goya.JPG|thumb|220x220px|''[[The Rape of Europa (Francisco de Goya)|The rape of Europa]] (El rapto de Europa),'' [[Francisco Goya]]]]
[[Francisco Goya]] was a portraitist and court painter to the Spanish Crown, a chronicler of history, and, in his unofficial work, a revolutionary and a visionary. Goya painted the Spanish royal family, including [[Charles IV of Spain]] and [[Ferdinand VII]]. His themes range from merry festivals for tapestry, draft cartoons, to scenes of war, fighting and corpses. In his early stage, he painted draft cartoons as templates for tapestries and focused on scenes from everyday life with vivid colors. During his lifetime, Goya also made several series of "grabados", etchings which depicted the decadence of society and the horrors of war. His most famous painting series are the ''[[Black Paintings]]'', painted at the end of his life. This series features works that are obscure in both color and meaning, producing uneasiness and shock.

He is considered the most important Spanish artist of late 18th and early 19th centuries and throughout his long career was a commentator and chronicler of his era. Immensely successful in his lifetime, Goya is often referred to as both the last of the [[Old Master]]s and the first of the moderns.

===19th Century ===
{{See also|Costumbrismo}}
[[File:Juana la Loca de Pradilla.jpg|right|thumb|Frederico Pradilla, ''Doña Juana La Loca'' (''[[Juana of Castile|Joan the Mad]]''). Museo del Prado.]]
Various art movements of the 19th Century influenced Spanish artists, largely through them undertaking training in foreign capitals, particularly in Paris and Rome. In this way [[Neo-classicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Impressionism]] became important strands. However, they were often delayed or transformed by local conditions, including repressive governments, and by the tragedies of the [[Carlist Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pp. 196, 202&lt;/ref&gt; Portraits and historical subjects were popular, and the art of the past - particularly the styles and techniques of Velázquez - were significant.

Early years were still dominated by the [[academicism]] of [[Vicente López y Portaña|Vincente López]] (1772&amp;ndash;1850) and then the Neoclassicism of the French painter, [[Jacques-Louis David]], as in the works by [[José de Madrazo]] (1781&amp;ndash;1859), the founder of an influential line of artists and gallery directors. His son, [[Federico de Madrazo]] (1781&amp;ndash;1859), was a leading figure in Spanish Romanticism, together with [[Leonardo Alenza]] (1807&amp;ndash;1845),
[[Valeriano Bécquer]] and [[Antonio María Esquivel]].&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pp. 196-200&lt;/ref&gt;

The later part of the century saw a strong period of Romanticism represented in history paintings, as in the works of [[Antonio Gisbert]] (1834&amp;ndash;1901), [[Eduardo Rosales]] (1836&amp;ndash;1873) and [[Francisco Pradilla]] (1848&amp;ndash;1921). In these works the techniques of Realism were frequently used with Romantic subjects. This can clearly be seen in ''Joan the Mad'', a famed early work by Pradilla. The composition, facial expressions, and stormy sky reflect the dramatic emotion of the scene; yet the precise clothing, the texture of the mud, and other details, show great realism in the artist's attitude and style.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p.208&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mariano Fortuny (painter)|Mariano Fortuny]](1838&amp;ndash;1874) also developed a strong Realist style, after earlier being influenced by the French Romantic [[Eugène Delacroix]], and became Spain's famous artist of the century&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Joaquín Sorolla - Chicos en la playa.jpg|left|thumb|[[Joaquín Sorolla]], ''Children on the beach'', 1910, Prado]]
The [[Valencia Province|Valencian]] 
[[Joaquín Sorolla]] (1863&amp;ndash;1923) excelled in the dexterous representation of the people and landscape under the sunlight of his native land, thus reflecting the spirit of [[Impressionism]] in many paintings, particularly his famous seaside paintings. In ''Children on the beach'' he makes the reflections, shadows and gloss of the water and skin his true subject. The composition is very daring, with the horizon omitted, one of the boys cut off, and strong diagonals leading to the contrasts and increased saturation of the upper-left of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, pp. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th Century===
[[File:Juan Gris - Glass of Beer and Playing Cards.jpg|thumb|upright|px|[[Juan Gris]], ''Glass of Beer and Playing Cards'', 1913, [[Columbus Museum of Art]], Ohio]]
[[File:Picasso Signatur-DuMont 1977.svg|thumb|left|Signature of [[Pablo Picasso]].]]
During the first half of 20th Century many leading Spanish artists were working in Paris, where they contributed to - and sometimes led - developments in the [[Modernist art]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Haftmann, pg 191&lt;/ref&gt;
As perhaps the most important example of this, [[Picasso]], working together with the French artist [[Braque]], created the concepts of [[Cubism]]; and the sub-movement of [[Cubism#Synthetic Cubism|Synthetic Cubism]] has been judged to have found its purest expression in the paintings and collages of Madrid-born [[Juan Gris]].&lt;ref&gt;Haftmann, pg 80&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, [[Salvador Dalí]] became a central figure of the [[Surrealist]] movement in Paris; and [[Joan Miró]] was influential in abstract art.

[[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]'s Blue Period (1901–1904), which consisted of somber, blue-tinted paintings was influenced by a trip through Spain. The [[Museu Picasso]] in Barcelona features many of Picasso's early works, created while he was living in Spain, as well as the extensive collection of Jaime Sabartés, Picasso's close friend from his Barcelona days who, for many years, was Picasso's personal secretary. There are many precise and detailed figure studies done in his youth under his father's tutelage, as well as rarely seen works from his old age that clearly demonstrate Picasso's firm grounding in classical techniques. Picasso presented the most durable homage to Velázquez in 1957 when he recreated ''[[Las Meninas (Picasso)|Las Meninas]]'' in his characteristically [[cubist]] form. While Picasso was worried that if he copied Velázquez's painting, it would be seen only as a copy and not as any sort of unique representation, he proceeded to do so, and the enormous work—the largest he had produced since ''Guernica'' in 1937—earned a position of relevance in the Spanish canon of art. [[Málaga]], Picasso's birthplace, houses two museums with significant collections, the [[Museo Picasso Málaga]] and [[Fundación Picasso|Birthplace Museum]].
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:The Persistence of Memory.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Salvador Dalí]], ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', 1931]] --&gt;

[[Salvador Dalí]] was a central artist within the [[Surrealist]] movement in Paris. Although Dalí was criticized for accommodating [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s regime, [[André Breton]], the Surrealist leader and poet, asked him to represent Spain at the 1959 [[Homage to Surrealism Exhibition]] which celebrated the fortieth anniversary of Surrealism. In line with the Surrealist movement's objectives, Dalí stated that his artistic aim was that "...the world of imagination and of concrete irrationality may be as objectively evident ... as that of the exterior world...",&lt;ref&gt;From Rubin ''Dada, Surrealism and Their Heritage'' pg. 111 (quoted in Gardner, pg. 984)&lt;/ref&gt; and this goal can be seen in one of his most familiar paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pg. 984&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]''. Here he paints with a precise, realistic style, based on studies of Dutch and Spanish masters,&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner pg. 985. 1991&lt;/ref&gt; but with a subject that dissolves the boundaries between organic and mechanical and is more akin to the nightmarish scenes of the Netherlandish painter [[Hieronymus Bosch]], whose ''[[Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' provided the model for the central, sleeping figure of Dalí's work.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Miro2.jpg|thumb|left|px|Joan Miró, ''La Leçon de Ski'', 1966, Sofia Imber Contemporary Art Museum of [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]]]] --&gt;

[[Joan Miró]] was also closely associated with the Surrealists in Paris, who particularly approved of his use of [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] in composition and execution, designed to expose the subconscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, pg. 985&lt;/ref&gt; Although his later and more popular paintings are refined, whimsical and apparently effortless, his influential period in the 1920s and 1930s produced works that were provocative in their sexual symbolism and imagery, and employing rough, experimental materials, including sandpaper, unsized canvases, and collage.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Hubert Martin, foreword of ''Joan Miró - Snail Woman Flower Star'', pg. 7, Prestel, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In mature period painting, ''La Leçon de Ski'', his characteristic language of signs, figures and black linear forms against more textured and painterly background is evident.

[[Ignacio Zuloaga]] and [[José Gutiérrez Solana]] were other significant painters of the first half of 20th century.

===Post WW2===

In the post-War period, the Catalan artist [[Antoni Tàpies]] became famous for his abstract works, many of which use very thick textures and the incorporation of non-standard materials and objects. Tàpies has won several international awards for his works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=2025&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio Tate website, quoting: Ronald Alley, ''Catalogue of the Tate Gallery's Collection of Modern Art other than Works by British Artists'', Tate Gallery and Sotheby Parke-Bernet, London 1981, pp. 714–15]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==
[[File:Sepulcro de la reina Leonor de Aragón, esposa de Juan I, rey de Castilla y León, y madre de Enrique III de Castilla y León, y de Fernando I el de Antequera, rey de Aragón. Catedral de Toledo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sepulcher of Elanor of Aragon, in the Cathedral of Toledo.]]
The Plateresque style extended from beginnings of the 16th century until the last third of the century and its stylistic influence pervaded the works of all great Spanish artists of the time.
[[Alonso Berruguete]] (sculptor, painter and architect) is called the "Prince of Spanish sculpture" because of the grandeur, originality, and expressiveness achieved in his works.
His main works were the upper stalls of the choir of the [[Cathedral of Toledo]], the tomb of Cardinal Tavera in the same Cathedral, and the altarpiece of the Visitation in the church of Santa Úrsula in the same locality.

Other notable sculptors were [[Bartolomé Ordóñez]], [[Diego de Siloé]], [[Juan de Juni]] and [[Damià Forment|Damián Forment]].
[[File:Alonso Cano, San Juan Bautista, 1634.jpg|thumb|px|left|upright|[[Saint John the Baptist (Alonso Cano)|''Saint John the Baptist'']], by [[Alonso Cano]] from the province of Valladolid. Now in the [[Museo Nacional de Escultura, Valladolid|National Museum of Sculpture of Castile and León]], Valladolid.]]
Another period of Spanish Renaissance sculpture, the Baroque, encompassed the last years of the 16th century and extended into the 17th century until reaching its final flowering the 18th, developing a truly Spanish school and style, of sculpture, more realistic, intimate and independently creative than that of the previous one which was tied to European trends, especially those of the Netherlands and Italy. There were two Schools of special flair and talent: the [[Sevillian school of sculpture|Seville School]], to which [[Juan Martínez Montañés]] belonged (called the Sevillian Fidias), whose most celebrated works are the Crucifix in the Cathedral of Seville, another in Vergara, and a Saint John; and the [[Granadan school of sculpture|Granada School]], to which [[Alonso Cano]] belonged, to whom an Immaculate Conception and a Virgin of Rosary, are attributed.

Another notable Andalusian Baroque sculptors were [[Pedro de Mena]], [[Pedro Roldán]]  and his daughter [[Luisa Roldán]], [[Juan de Mesa]] and [[Pedro Duque Cornejo]].

The Valladolid school of the 17th century ([[Gregorio Fernández]], [[Francisco del Rincón]]) was succeeded in the 18th century, although with less brilliance, by the Madrid School, and it was soon transformed into a purely academic style by the middle of the century. In turn, the Andalusian school was replaced by that of Murcia, epitomised in the person of [[Francisco Salzillo]], during the first half of the century. This last sculptor is distinguished by the originality, fluidity, and dynamic treatment of his works, even in those representations of great tragedy. More than 1,800 works are attributed to him, the most famous products of his hand being the Holy Week floats (pasos) in Murcia, most notable amongst which are those of the Agony in the Garden and the Kiss of Judas.

In the 20th century the most important Spanish sculptors were [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González]], [[Pablo Gargallo]], [[Eduardo Chillida]] and [[Pablo Serrano]].

==Spanish collectors and museums of art==
{{See also|Golden Triangle of Art}}

Spanish monarchs beginning with Isabel the Catholic, Queen of Castile (1451–1504), who accumulated large and impressive collections of objets d'art, 370 tapastries, and 350 paintings, a number by important artists including [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Hans Memling]], [[Hieronymous Bosch]], [[Juan de Flandes]], and [[Sandro Botticelli]].&lt;ref&gt;Santiago Alcolea Blanch, ''The Prado''. New York: Harry N. Adams, Inc. 1996, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Isabel's grandson, Charles I of Spain, the first Hapsburg king of Spain,  was a patron and collector of art, as was his sister, Mary of Hungary. Both admired works by [[Titian]]. When the siblings died, the art passed to Philip II of Spain, Charles's son.&lt;ref&gt;Alcolea Blanch, ''The Prado'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Philip IV (1605–1665) followed in the family tradition as a passionate art collector and patron.  During his reign, [[Velázquez]], [[Zurbarán]] and others produced many works of art. Philip commissioned works and purchased others, sending his representatives to acquire works for the monarch's collection.  One of Philip IV's major contributions to art in Spain was to entail his collection, preventing their sale or other dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;Alcolea Blanch, ''The Prado'', pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the Spanish Bourbon monarch, Charles IV, the notion of bringing together major works from other repositories in Spain took shape, probably not for the public to view but for artists to study.&lt;ref&gt;Alcolea Blanch, ''The Prado'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prado Museum]] in Madrid became the main repository for that art. 

The [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Francisco]], founded in 1744, now functions also as a museum in Madrid. The [[Museum of the Americas (Madrid)|Museum of the Americas]] in Madrid has a collection of [[casta]] paintings and other art brought back to Spain from the Americas, as well as sculpture and archeological artifacts.

==Plot==
[[File:Shanti Stupa, Dhauli 01.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Shanti Stupa at [[Dhauli]], where the song "Shiva Poojaku" was filmed]]
[[File:Pushpawati vof2.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Pushpawati River rushing out at the [[Valley of Flowers National Park]], where the song "Ghallu Ghallu" was shot]]
[[File:BhanuPriya-SwarnaKamalam.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Bhanu Priya's painting in the film]]
Meenakshi ([[Bhanupriya]]) and Savitri (Devilalita) are daughters of a [[Kuchipudi]] doyen,  Vedantam Seshendra Sharma. While a highly accomplished artist in his field, Seshendra Sharma is not well-off and has not been able to afford for his daughters, a conventional education. Both of them have achieved a respectable degree of proficiency — Savitri in Carnatic classical music and Meenakshi in classical dance.

Savitri is grateful for her knowledge and interest and looks forward to a life that will require her to hone her skills in the same art. Meenakshi, on the other hand, is bitter about the lack of opportunity that she feels in the field of classical dance in India and resolves to make a simpler and more pleasurable life for herself as soon as possible, while confiding her ambitions only to her sister.

Chandrasekhar ([[Daggubati Venkatesh|Venkatesh]]) is a tenant who has just moved in next door. He is a painter and is shown to be handling movie promotions as a large amount of his work. He develops an interest in the neighbors and tries to help them in whatever way he can, partly because of his (unconfessed) interest in Meenakshi and partly because of his interest in the art which seems to be slowly fading away from public life.

The rest of the film is largely built around Meenakshi's journey from skepticism to devotion in her pursuit of dance. Chandrasekhar is shown to be an important catalyst in this transformation. Meenakshi becomes an accomplished dancer through the direction of renowned Odissi dancer [[Sharon Lowen]], and gets the [[Fulbright Program|opportunity]] to go to the [[United States]] and perform. She learns of Chandrasekhar's love for her, and finally unites with Chandrasekhar, confessing her love for him as well.

==Career==
[[File:Terry Brooks by Gage Skidmore.jpg|left|thumb|Brooks at a book signing at the 2017 [[Phoenix Comicon]]]]
Brooks had been a writer since high school, writing mainly in the genres of [[science fiction]], western, fiction, and [[Non-fiction writing|non-fiction]].&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt; One day, in his early college life, he was given a copy of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', which inspired him to write in one genre.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt; While Tolkien inspired the genre, Brooks stated during his TEDxRainier talk "Why I Write about Elves",&lt;ref name="Why I Write about Elves"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=Terry|title=Why I Write about Elves|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Why-I-Write-about-Elves-Terry-B|website=tedxtalks.ted.com|accessdate=December 14, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019000949/http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Why-I-Write-about-Elves-Terry-B|archivedate=October 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as at the Charlotte Literary Festival that he credits the inspiration of his style of writing to [[William Faulkner]]'s works.&lt;ref name="Why I Write about Elves"/&gt; With this inspiration, he then made his debut in 1977 with ''[[The Sword of Shannara]]''.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt;

After finishing two sequels to ''The Sword of Shannara'', Brooks moved on to the series which would become known as the ''[[Magic Kingdom of Landover|Landover]]'' novels.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt; Brooks then wrote a four-book series titled ''[[The Heritage of Shannara]]''.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt; For the next fourteen years, he wrote more ''Landover'' books, then went on to write ''The Word and Void'' trilogy.  Continuing the ''[[Shannara]]'' series, Brooks wrote the prequel to ''The Sword of Shannara'', titled ''[[First King of Shannara]]''.  He then wrote two series, ''[[The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara]]'' and ''[[High Druid of Shannara]]'' and recently finished a third, ''[[Genesis of Shannara]]'', a trilogy bridging his ''Word and Void'' and ''Shannara'' series.  The sixth book in the ''Landover'' series, ''[[A Princess of Landover]]'', was released in August 2009. 
Returning to Shannara, a duology, ''[[Legends of Shannara]]'', taking place after the events of ''[[Genesis of Shannara]]'', was written next. The first book, entitled ''[[Bearers of the Black Staff]]'', was released in August 2010 and the second, ''[[The Measure of the Magic]]'', was released in August 2011.
He next completed a trilogy entitled ''[[The Dark Legacy of Shannara]]''. The three books are; ''[[Wards of Faerie]]'' (Feb 2013), ''[[Bloodfire Quest]]'' (June 2013), and ''Witch Wraith'' (Dec 2013). He followed this with the trilogy ''Defenders of Shannara'', which include ''The High Druid's Blade'' (July 2014), ''The Darkling Child'' (June 2015), and ''The Sorcerer's Daughter'' (May 24, 2016).
According to his website, he is currently working on the final and concluding tetralogy of the Shannara series known as [[The Fall of Shannara]]. The first book in the tetralogy is [[The Black Elfstone]] and was released on June 13, 2017.

A television series based on the Shannara works, entitled ''[[The Shannara Chronicles]]'' began showing on MTV in January 2016. The show starts with the second book of the original series, ''Elfstones'', as there are strong female roles which did not appear in the first book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/terry-brooks-mtv-is-doing-the-shannara-chronicles.html|title=Terry Brooks: MTV is Doing The Shannara Chronicles Right|author=|date=|website=pastemagazine.com|accessdate=May 9, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828103526/https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/terry-brooks-mtv-is-doing-the-shannara-chronicles.html|archivedate=August 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second season aired in 2017 on SPIKE &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2870369/shannara-chronicles-renewed/|title=MTV Renews The Shannara Chronicles For Second Season|author=|date=|website=mtv.com|accessdate=May 9, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106054106/http://www.mtv.com/news/2870369/shannara-chronicles-renewed/|archivedate=November 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 2018, it was announced that the series had been cancelled after two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title=‘The Shannara Chronicles’ Canceled After Two Seasons |url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-canceled-after-two-seasons-spike-mtv-paramount-network-1202244383/ |website=Deadline |accessdate=January 17, 2018 |date=January 17, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117033103/http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-canceled-after-two-seasons-spike-mtv-paramount-network-1202244383/ |archivedate=January 17, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Producers later announced that the series is being shopped to other networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Andreeva |first1=Nellie |title=‘The Shannara Chronicles’ Shopped To Other Networks For Season 3 |url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-shopped-other-networks-season-3-1202244442/ |website=Deadline |accessdate=January 17, 2018 |date=January 17, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117064831/http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-shopped-other-networks-season-3-1202244442/ |archivedate=January 17, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novels versus short stories==
After writing "[[Indomitable (short story)|Indomitable]]", a short story constituting an epilogue to ''[[The Wishsong of Shannara]]'', Terry Brooks declared:
{{quote|I find it much harder to write short stories than long fiction. I feel cramped by the lack of space and the dictates of the form. There is considerable difference in long and short fiction disciplines, and I am not good with the latter. I hope not to have to do many more of them, but you never know. I must have written Indomitable anywhere from four to five times, each effort different. Give me a five hundred page sprawl as an assignment any day.&lt;ref name="Writing Q&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web | last = Brooks | first = Terry | title = Ask Terry Q&amp;A - Writing | date = 1999–2008 | url = http://www.terrybrooks.net/askterry/writing.html | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120914051957/http://www.terrybrooks.net/askterry/writing.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-09-14 | accessdate = 2008-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''The Clock''''' is an art installation by video artist [[Christian Marclay]]. It is a looped 24-hour video [[supercut]] ([[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of scenes from film and television) that feature clocks or timepieces. The artwork itself functions as a [[clock]]: its presentation is synchronized with the real time, resulting in the time shown in a scene being the actual time. 

Marclay developed the idea for ''The Clock'' while working on his 2005 piece ''Screen Play''. With the support of the London-based [[White Cube]] gallery, he assembled a team to find footage, which he edited together over the course of three years. Marclay debuted ''The Clock'' at White Cube's London gallery in 2010. The work garnered critical praise, winning the [[Golden Lion]] at the 2011 [[Venice Biennale]]. Its six editions were purchased by major museums, allowing it to attract a widespread following.

==Production==

===Conception===
''The Clock'' was conceived in 2005 while Marclay was working on the video score ''Screen Play''. He realised that he needed a way for musicians to synchronise with film footage. An assistant at the [[Eyebeam Art and Technology Center]] brought him footage of clocks, and Marclay began wondering if it was possible to find footage of every minute of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Toop |first=David |authorlink=David Toop |date=October 2011 |title=Painting in Slang |journal=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]] |issue=332 |pages=41–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept the idea secret for several years, concerned that someone else would poach his idea.&lt;ref name="johnson-lat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/18/entertainment/la-et-clock-20110518 |title=For Christian Marclay, 'The Clock' continues to tick |last=Johnson |first=Reed |date=18 May 2011 |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his partner Lydia Yee accepted a position at the [[Barbican Centre]], Marclay moved from New York to London in mid 2007. There he proposed the film to the White Cube gallery, unsure of the project's feasibility. He received a budget of over US$100,000, covered in part by the [[Paula Cooper Gallery]].&lt;ref name="zalewski-new-yorker"/&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Night of the Living Dead - Ten Minutes to Three.webm|thumb|left|Not all scenes show a clock, such as one from ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' announcing "It's ten minutes to three."]]
The first several months of production were intended to show that Marclay would be able to find enough material to achieve his vision. White Cube helped him assemble a team of six people to watch DVDs and copy scenes with clocks or time. Marclay himself was often unfamiliar with the source works. They used a [[Google Spreadsheet]] to record and search through clips. As the number of scenes available increased, Marclay was able to start working on transitions between scenes.&lt;ref name="zalewski-new-yorker"/&gt; Working in [[Final Cut Pro]], he edited clips together, standardising the video formats and smoothing the audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/48134-christian-marclays-the-clock |title=Christian Marclay's ''The Clock'' |last=Bowen |first=Peter |date=12 July 2012 |website=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]] |access-date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cited [[Bruce Conner]]'s "odd transitions" as an influence on his editing. Marclay wanted to include more outlandish, melodramatic clips but worried that it would be exhausting over a long period. He instead focused on incidental moments; his head assistant Paul Anton Smith explained that Marclay wanted to show scenes that were "banal and plain but visually interesting." One assistant who focused heavily on scenes of violence was fired, and the remaining assistants began to specialise in individual [[film genre]]s.&lt;ref name="zalewski-new-yorker"/&gt;

After six months, Marclay presented White Cube with several extended sequences, confident that he would eventually be able to finish the project. The footage began taking up too much capacity, so he worked on two [[Power Mac G5]]s with footage split by time of day. Marclay organised files by hour, which became like chapters for him. Each folder suggested different themes to him, allowing him to form loose narratives. He spent three years editing scenes together.&lt;ref name="zalewski-new-yorker"/&gt; Some of the scenes not selected for ''The Clock'' became a part of his 2012 performance piece ''Everyday''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/9571926/Christian-Marclay-arts-man-of-the-moment.html |title=Christian Marclay: art's man of the moment |last=Davies |first=Lucy |date=1 October 2012 |website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |access-date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid 2010, Marclay recruited Quentin Chiappetta, a sound designer with whom he had worked before, to work on the audio for ''The Clock''. He saved files to disc and sent them to Chiappetta so that the films' soundtracks could be [[equalization (audio)|equalised]]. By September Marclay realised that hundreds of the audio transitions were lacking, with White Cube set to premiere ''The Clock'' the following month. Because of his background as a DJ, he did not want to use simple [[fade (audio engineering)|fade]]s between clips. He  went to Chiappetta's MediaNoise studio in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]], where the two worked on the soundtrack using [[Pro Tools]]. In some cases, they created completely new audio for the scenes.&lt;ref name="zalewski-new-yorker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thornton-economist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/16885826 |title=Slave to the rhythm |last=Thornton |first=Sarah |authorlink=Sarah Thornton |date=25 August 2010 |website=[[The Economist]] |access-date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first week of ''The Clock''{{'}}s exhibition, Marclay continued fixing continuity errors and working on the audio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.art-it.asia/u/admin_ed_feature_e/yvKBQHCwb9cmLxYnEO2l |title=Christian Marclay: The Clock |last=Maerkle |first=Andrew |date=24 December 2010 |website=ART iT |access-date=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final product used around 12,000 clips.&lt;ref name="borrelli-chicago-tribune"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-the-clock-walker-museum-20140726-column.html |title=Time is ticking at 'The Clock' exhibit in Minneapolis |last=Borrelli |first=Christopher |date=25 July 2014 |website=[[Chicago Tribune]] |access-date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its size, Marclay enlisted professor Mick Grierson to create a program that plays the separate audio and video tracks, synchronised with the current time.&lt;ref name="zalewski-new-yorker"/&gt; The program continues running while a museum is closed so that it remains synchronised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/a-24-hour-movie-that-may-be-the-biggest-and-best-supercut-ever-9430/?all |title=A 24-Hour Movie That May Be the Biggest (and Best) Supercut Ever |last=Stromberg |first=Joseph |date=28 December 2012 |website=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |access-date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
Marclay made six editions of ''The Clock'', plus two [[artist's proof]]s.&lt;ref name="woodward-wsj"/&gt; Five copies were designated to be sold to institutions for US$467,500 each under the condition that ''The Clock'' can't be played in more than one location at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/10/christian-marclay-the-clock-tate-modern-london|title='It's impossible!' – Christian Marclay and the 24-hour clock made of movie clips|last=Bradshaw|first=Peter|date=2018-09-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last copy was sold to hedge fund manager [[Steven A.

===Exhibition===
Marclay originally considered making ''The Clock'' as a [[public art]] piece. However, difficulty with lighting and sound made it impractical.&lt;ref name="zalewski-new-yorker"/&gt; Marclay gave museums specifications for the exhibitions' screening rooms.&lt;ref name="borrelli-chicago-tribune"/&gt; He wanted the video to be projected onto a {{convert|21|x|12|foot|m}} screen, in a room with white [[IKEA]] couches.&lt;ref name="krauss-october"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krauss |first=Rosalind E. |authorlink=Rosalind E.

''[[The Art Newspaper]]'' reported that [[LACMA]]'s director [[Michael Govan]] wanted to project it onto the museum, though LACMA denied suggesting it be projected outside.&lt;ref name="zalewski-new-yorker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burns |first=Charlotte |date=April 2011 |title=Coming soon? Movie montage for LA |journal=[[The Art Newspaper]] |volume=20 |issue=223 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marclay disapproved of other screening locations suggested by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Tate.&lt;ref name="zalewski-new-yorker"/&gt; In order to ensure that the full video would be exhibited, he required that museums agree to be open for all 24 hours at some point during its run.&lt;ref name="borrelli-chicago-tribune"/&gt;

''The Clock'' premiered 15 October 2010 at White Cube's gallery in central London.&lt;ref name="smith-nyrb"/&gt; Since then, it has attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors and found crossover success beyond art patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aspden |first=Peter |date=24 January 2015 |title=Playing to the gallery |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/f5263964-a164-11e4-8d19-00144feab7de.html |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |page=1 |access-date=3 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="romney-sight-sound"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Romney |first=Jonathan |date=11 May 2011 |title=The Clock: What time is it where? |url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/49723 |journal=[[Sight &amp; Sound]] |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=30–1 |access-date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paula Cooper Gallery exhibited it in early 2011, where it attracted 11,500 visitors over the course of a month.

===Copyright===
When he started to make ''The Clock'', Marclay expected that copyright would not be a substantial obstacle, theorizing that "If you make something good and interesting and not ridiculing someone or being offensive, the creators of the original material will like it."&lt;ref name="zalewski-new-yorker"/&gt; He did not get copyright clearances for any of the films used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/time-lord-christian-marclay-is-one-to-watch-at-the-mca/story-fn9n8gph-1226299070960 |title=Time lord Christian Marclay is one to watch at the MCA |last=Westwood |first=Matthew |date=17 March 2012 |website=[[The Australian]] |access-date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that although his use was illegal, "most would consider it [[fair use]]."&lt;ref name="thornton-economist"/&gt; Because of the film's copyright status, museums have offered it as part of their general admission instead of charging for separate tickets.&lt;ref name="borrelli-chicago-tribune"/&gt;

==Reception==
''The Clock'' has been described as "addictive" and "mesmerizing". ''[[The Guardian]]'' called it "a masterpiece of our times".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/apr/07/christian-marclay-the-clock |title=Christian Marclay's The Clock: a masterpiece of our times |last=Bradshaw |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Bradshaw |date=7 April 2011 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Petit]] complimented its "edge-of-hysteria relentlessness, the anti-narrative drive", and the simple concept, commenting that he wished he had thought of the idea himself.&lt;ref name="sinclair-petit-film-comment"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sinclair |first1=Iain |authorlink1=Iain Sinclair |last2=Petit |first2=Chris |authorlink2=Chris Petit |date=May 2011 |title=Time Pieces |journal=[[Film Comment]] |publisher=[[Film Society of Lincoln Center]] |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=50–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', [[Zadie Smith]] stated that ''The Clock'' "is neither bad nor good, but sublime, maybe the greatest film you have ever seen".&lt;ref name="smith-nyrb"/&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' named Marclay one of the ten most important artists of today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/10-most-important-artists-today-67947 |title=The 10 Most Important Artists of Today |last=Gopnik |first=Blake |date=5 June 2011 |website=[[Newsweek]] |subscription=yes |access-date=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was included in the 2012 [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://time.com/42520/christian-marclay/ |title=2012 TIME 100 Includes Artist Christian Marclay |last=Dyer |first=Geoff |authorlink=Geoff Dyer |date=18 April 2012 |website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2011 [[Venice Biennale]], Marclay was recognised as the best artist in the official exhibition, winning the Golden Lion for ''The Clock''. Accepting the Golden Lion, Marclay invoked [[Andy Warhol]], thanking the jury "for giving ''The Clock'' its fifteen minutes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/123932/artinfos-rundown-of-the-winners-of-the-golden-and-silver-lions |title=ARTINFO's Rundown of the Winners of the Golden and Silver Lions at the 54th Venice Biennale |last1=Goldstein |first1=Andrew M. |last2=Halperin |first2=Julia |date=6 June 2011 |publisher=[[Artinfo]] |access-date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also won in the "Best Editing" category at the [[Boston Society of Film Critics Awards 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/11/idUS201794256320111211 |title='The Artist' Named Best Picture by Boston Film Critics |date=11 December 2011 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |access-date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
''The Clock'' reveals its plot largely through the use of [[cutaway shot]]s. A shot indicating the time is followed by a [[reaction shot]] with a character's emotional response, often one of anxiety, fear, or boredom.&lt;ref name="krauss-october"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2011/09/20/a_watched_clock_globe_reporters_spend_24_hours_watching_christian_marclays_film/?page=full |title=Tick-tock: A watched 'Clock' |date=20 September 2011 |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |access-date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petit remarked that the impact of repeated reactions lacking context "comes over as incredibly weird".&lt;ref name="sinclair-petit-film-comment"/&gt; The sequence [[interpellation (philosophy)|interpellates]] viewers into ''The Clock''{{'}}s flow, and they often experience a detached, hypnotic effect.&lt;ref name="russell-framework"/&gt;

Marclay viewed ''The Clock'' as a ''[[memento mori]]''.&lt;ref name="thornton-economist"/&gt; In contrast to the escapism that cinema provides, ''The Clock'' draws attention to how much time the audience has spent watching it.&lt;ref name="johnson-lat"/&gt; As they spend more time with the film, its actors reappear at various points in their careers. To make this theme more explicit, Marclay included symbols of time and death in connecting shots. These included sunsets; withering flowers; and burning cigarettes, which he described as "the twentieth-century symbol of time", a modern version of burning candles.&lt;ref name="zalewski-new-yorker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="romney-sight-sound"/&gt; Marclay included shots of turntables and vinyl records not only as a representation of "capturing time, trying to hold it back", but also as a self-reference to his earlier works that used vinyl.&lt;ref name="romney-sight-sound"/&gt;

===Relation to other works===
Marclay made several forays into video art that informed ''The Clock''. His 1995 film ''Telephones'' forms a narrative out of clips from [[Hollywood film]]s where characters use a telephone.&lt;ref name="gonzalez-marclay"&gt;{{cite book |last1=González |first1=Jennifer |last2=Gordon |first2=Kim |authorlink2=Kim Gordon |last3=Higgs |first3=Matthew |authorlink3=Matthew Higgs |date=June 2005 |title=Christian Marclay |publisher=[[Phaidon Press]] |page=61 |isbn=978-0-7148-4374-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a link between Marclay's [[audio art|audio]] and video art, and its discontinuous structure was a template for ''The Clock''. ''Telephones'' broke using a telephone into several discrete steps, each reenacted by multiple films, similar to sequences in ''The Clock'' where the act of sleeping or waking is demonstrated by one character after another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fowler |first=Catherine |date=September 2013 |title=''The Clock'': Gesture and Cinematic Replaying |journal=Framework: The Journal of Cinema and Media |publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]] |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=226–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1998 film ''Up and Out'' combines video from [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' with audio from [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Blow Out]]''. It was an early experiment in the effect of synchronization, where viewers naturally attempted to find intersections between the two works, and it developed the editing style that Marclay employs for ''The Clock''.&lt;ref name="gonzalez-marclay"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/07/10/its-about-time/ |title=It's About Time |last=Pollack |first=Barbara |date=10 July 2012 |website=[[ARTnews]] |access-date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2002 installation ''Video Quartet'' is a 13-minute video with four continuous screens of clips from commercial films. Its combinations of coinciding sounds and images were a model for the [[synchronicity]] of ''The Clock''.&lt;ref name="krauss-october"/&gt;

''The Clock'' has been viewed as an extension of similar compilations, particularly by Christoph Girardet. Girardet's 1999 ''Phoenix Tapes'', a collaboration with [[Matthias Müller (filmmaker)|Matthias Müller]], is composed of footage from [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films. It arranges them into clusters to illustrate Hitchcock's techniques and motifs. Girardet and Müller use low-quality footage from VHS tapes to draw attention to their appropriation. In contrast, Marclay seeks to replicate Hollywood production through high-quality footage with standardised sound production and aspect ratios.&lt;ref name="horwatt-framework"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Horwatt |first=Eli |date=September 2013 |title=On ''The Clock'' and Christian Marclay's Instrumental Logic of Appropriation |journal=Framework: The Journal of Cinema and Media |publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]] |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=208–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girardet's 2003 work ''60 Seconds (analog)'' is a 60-second film intended to be played on a loop. 60 brief shots show the hands of watches and clocks counting the seconds. Girardet wanted to show how interchangeable the cinema footage could be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monopol-magazin.de/ist-christian-marclays-clock-ein-plagiat |title=Ist Christian Marclays 'The Clock' ein Plagiat? |last=Hinrichsen |first=Jens |date=10 October 2011 |website=Monopol |access-date=5 June 2015 |language=German |trans-title=Is Christian Marclay's 'The Clock' plagiarism?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Müller described it as ''The Clock'' "in a conceptual, minimalist nutshell."&lt;ref name="horwatt-framework"/&gt; In 2005 [[Étienne Chambaud]] presented ''L'Horloge'', a piece of software that displays the time using images of clocks in films. Chambaud's use of still images give ''L'Horloge'' a slower, more regular pace, whereas ''The Clock'' experiments with the rhythm of commercial films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/read/komp-laint-dept-marclay |title=Komplaint Dept. |last=Nickas |first=Bob |date=26 January 2012 |website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |access-date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thierry Mugler''' ({{IPA-fr|tjɛʁi myɡle}}; born 21 December 1948) is a [[French people|French]] [[fashion designer]].

==Early life and education==
Mugler was born in [[Strasbourg, France]]. His passion led him to focus more on drawing than on school, {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} and at the age of 9, he began to study classical dance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} By 14, he joined the ballet corps for the Rhin Opera ([[Opéra national du Rhin]]).&lt;ref name="cirquedusoleil.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/press/kits/shows/zumanity/resources/creators/thierry-mugler.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018132508/http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/press/kits/shows/zumanity/resources/creators/thierry-mugler.aspx |archivedate=18 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Mugler began formal [[interior design]] training at the [[Haute école des arts du Rhin|Strasbourg School of Decorative Arts]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Career==
At the age of 24, Mugler moved to [[Paris]], France. He began designing clothes for Parisian boutique, Gudule. At 26, Mugler, who was working as a freelance designer, began to design for a variety of large [[ready-to-wear]] [[fashion house]]s in [[Paris]], [[Milan]], [[London]] and [[Barcelona]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1973, Mugler created his first personal collection called "Café de Paris". The style of the collection was both sophisticated and urban. Melka Tréanton, a powerful fashion editor, helped to launch his career. In 1976, she asked him to show his work in [[Tokyo]]  for an event organized by [[Shiseido]].&lt;ref name="shiseido"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shiseido.co.jp/releimg/1790-e.pdf|date=19 August 2010|title=Window Display Exhibition in Paris to Commemorate the 30th Anniversary of Shiseido Cosmetics Sales in France|accessdate=9 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924101406/http://www.shiseido.co.jp/releimg/1790-e.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, he opened his first Paris boutique at the [[Place des Victoires]] in the [[1st arrondissement of Paris|1er Arrondissement]]). At the same time, Thierry Mugler launched a fashion collection for men. For this collection, he reworked classical masculinity, giving it a definitively modern style. A clean, precise, structured cut which outlined a highly recognizable silhouette: prominent shoulders, both "anatomical and classic", for a dynamically slender look.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Thierry Mugler became an internationally recognized designer, and his collections garnered much commercial success. At the request of the [[Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture]], he completed his first [[haute couture]] collection in 1992.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

He created the famous black dress worn by [[Demi Moore]] in the 1993 movie, ''[[Indecent Proposal]]''.

His clothes are identified by their style and their structure. Mugler, over the next two decades created a style that was very much of its time: it was strong, angular, and sometimes almost cruel. Shoulders were wide and padded; waists were wasp-like. Prints were banished: Mugler’s clothes came in solid, dominating colors. Collars had exaggerated points, or flame-like cutouts. The insect kingdom was a constant influence, as were the ladies and gentlemen of film noir. PVC was often used as his material for his runway pieces, used to create space and robot themes.&lt;ref&gt;http://fashion.infomat.com/thierry-mugler-designer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Mugler published his first [[photography]] book in 1988, ''Thierry Mugler, Photographe''. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} This was followed by a [[monograph]] in 1999 entitled, ''Fashion Fetish Fantasy'' which assembles photos of his creations.

Mugler also directs short films, advertising films and video clips. He regularly designs costumes for musical comedies, concerts, operas and the theatre (including Macbeth for the [[Comédie Française]]). He has worked with [[Robert Altman]] and [[George Michael]] (he directed the video for Michael's "[[Too Funky]]" in 1992). He also directed the first advertising film for one of his fragrances, Alien.

In 2002 Mugler collaborated with the [[Cirque du Soleil]]. He directed "Extravaganza", one of the scenes of [[Zumanity]], and also created all of the costumes and the identity of the characters in the show.

In 2009, Mugler worked as artistic advisor to singer [[Beyoncé]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/fashion/289751/thierry-mugler-to-design-beyonce-tour.html Thierry Mugler to Design Beyonce Tour] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212082019/http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/fashion/289751/thierry-mugler-to-design-beyonce-tour.html |date=12 December 2009 }} Marie Claire, 2008. Accessed 29 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He created the costumes for her "[[I Am... World Tour]]".&lt;ref name="cirquedusoleil.com"/&gt;

In 2016, Mugler created and directed the music video and staging for [[San Marino]]'s [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|Eurovision Song Contest]] entry [[I Didn't Know]] performed by Turkish singer [[Serhat (singer)|Serhat]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=san_marino_serhat_presents_i_didnt_know&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the Mugler's brand launched Thierry Mugler Beauty, a high-end line of [[cosmetics]].

In September 2010 [[Nicola Formichetti]] was announced to be the  [[Creative Director]] of the Thierry Mugler [[brand]]. He changed the brand name to MUGLER, removing the first name, and in January 2011 he launched the revival of the brand's [[menswear]] collection in collaboration with [[Romain Kremer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Suzy MENKES|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/fashion/on-top-of-the-world.html|title=On top of the world|website=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 2010 ''[[New York Times]]'' story discussed Mugler's [[cosmetic surgery|cosmetic transformation]]. "[Mugler has] taken to calling himself Manfred and transformed his body...into what is apparently a 240-pound spectacle of muscle and nipple and tattoo..."

With over two years of being the creative director of MUGLER, Formichetti announced in April 2013 that he and the fashion house will be parting ways. Formichetti  left MUGLER in  to work for the Italian brand [[Diesel (brand)|Diesel]].

In December 2013, House of Mugler announced  [[David Koma]] as the [[artistic director]].&lt;ref name="Thierry Mugler Names David Koma Artistic Director"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/thierry-mugler-taps-david-koma-7312059?src=n/newsAlert/20131213-1 | title=Thierry Mugler Names David Koma Artistic Director | publisher=WWD | date=12 December 2013 | accessdate=13 December 2013| author=Socha, Miles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fragrances===
{{see|Angel (perfume)}}
[[File:Angel Men (1413014127).jpg|thumb|right|Angel for men (A*Men)]]

Mugler’s first [[perfume]] appeared in 1992 and was called ''[[Angel (perfume)|Angel]]''. "Angel" contains a combination of praline and [[chocolate]] mixed with a strong accord of [[patchouli]]. It would be a part of a new fragrance type called [[gourmand (fragrance)|gourmand]]. The Angel bottle, a design in the shape of a faceted star, was created by the Brosse Master Glassmakers. Fans of the fragrance include [[Diana Ross]], [[Barbara Walters]], [[Eva Mendes]], and [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celebrityfragranceguide.com/ http://www.celebrityfragranceguide.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 Mugler followed up Angel with a male version named Angel Men or A*Men. This fragrance includes notes of caramel, [[coffee]], vanilla, [[patchouli]], and honey.

In 2005, Alien was created, the second major Thierry Mugler fragrance. Also in 2005, Thierry Mugler launched the Thierry Mugler Perfume Workshops", which are open to the general public and led by specialists of the [[perfumery]] and [[oenology]] world.

Angel and Alien together produce about $280&amp;nbsp;million in sales annually.&lt;ref name="NYtimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/fashion/02MUGLER.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 Thierry Mugler, Still Creating a Stir] NY Times. 2010. Accessed 29 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the fragrance Womanity was released by the house of Mugler.&lt;ref&gt;womanity.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Mugler's newest fragrance, Angel Muse, was released in 2015. 

In 2006, Thierry Mugler completed a project for the launch of [[Tom Tykwer]]'s film "Perfume". In collaboration with the IFF company, Thierry Mugler created a box set of fifteen compositions.

During 2007, still following the metamorphosis theme, Mugler launched Mirror, Mirror, a collection of five fragrances, created as "perfume-trickery" to "enhance one’s presence".

==Personal life==
Mugler is openly gay, and is a longtime [[bodybuilder]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/read/thierry-mugler Thierry Mugler] vice.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Détail du tombeau de Philippe Pot (17863220888).jpg|340px|thumb|Detail of the pleurants]] 
The '''Tomb of Philippe Pot''' is a 15th-century [[Funerary art|funerary monument]] commissioned by [[Philippe Pot]] (d. 1493), royal steward of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] under [[Louis XI]], between c. 1477–80 for his burial at the chapel of Saint-Jean-Baptiste in [[Cîteaux Abbey]], south of [[Dijon]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, xi&lt;/ref&gt; 

It consists of eight life-sized [[pleurants]], represented as solemn and hooded [[pallbearer]]s carrying Philippe's recumbent [[effigy]] towards its final resting place.&lt;ref name = "Sadler22"&gt;Sadler, 22&lt;/ref&gt; Made of polychromed [[limestone]], paint, gold and lead, it measures 181 (width) x 260 (height) x 167 (depth) cm. No definitive attributions have been made as to the artists and craftsmen who created the work, but [[Antoine Le Moiturier]] is often suggested to have produced the mourners. 

The tomb was plundered during the French revolution, and in the 19th century positioned in private gardens in hotels in Dijon. It has been in the collection of the [[Louvre|Musée du Louvre]] since 1899, where it is on permanent display.

==Description==
[[Philip the Bold]] (1363–1404) commissioned the first of the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] tombs in the latter part of the 14th century, hiring [[Claus Sluter]] as sculptor, whose distinctive style in which many small pleurants are positioned surrounding the effigy, was copied for the next century. Philippe Pot (1428–1493), royal stewart and seneschal to the Dukes of Burgundy, was raised at the Burgundian court, where he was educated. His tomb follows the tradition of the earliest ducal tombs, with Sluter's influence evident in the presence of mourners – or pleurants. As art historian Donna Sadler writes, a century after Sluter's work, in Pot's tomb "the ''pleurants'' have taken steroids and become life-sized, bearing the effigy upon their shoulders".&lt;ref name = "Sadler22"/&gt;

Philippe Pot reposes on a limestone plate or slab, and is dressed in a [[Knight|Knightly]] helmet and armor with a [[Gilding|gilded]] breastplate. His head rests on a cushion, his eyes are open and his hands are clasped in prayer. A sword lies to his side while a lion rests at his feet. The mourners, whose carved forms seem influenced by the Dutch sculptor Claus Sluter,&lt;ref&gt;Hourihane, 357&lt;/ref&gt; are carved in black stone, and dressed full length black hooded [[Religious habit|habit]]s. Each bows their head in grief, and each bears an individually designed gilded heraldic shield, which may refer to Philippe's lineage, making the monument of the "Kinship tomb" type.&lt;ref&gt;McGee Morganstern, 8&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb is in good condition, but has been restored in places; a 19th century engraving shows Philippe's hands broken apart.&lt;ref name="ss158"&gt;Sterling &amp; Salinger, 158&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:GD-FR-Paris-Louvre-Sculptures034.JPG|thumb|320px|View]]

Its style and scale became influential, because the sculptor transformed the size and placement of''pleurants'', which had been relatively small figures standing in niches around the sarcophagus. Its influence is evidenced by the similar tombs of Louis de Savoisy (d. 1515) and Jacques de Mâlain (d. 1527).&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution==
The monument was commissioned to stand over Philippe's grave in the north arm of the chapel's [[transept]].  The artists and craftsmen involved in its production have not been identified, although the French sculptor Antoine Le Moiturier is often suggested as likely to have created the pleurants, based on the facial types and according to art historian Colum Hourihane the "unusually rigid drapery".&lt;ref&gt;Hourihane, 40&lt;/ref&gt; Guillaume Chandelier has also been suggested as involved, but there is little concrete evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Hofstatter, 137, 256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MoF"&gt;"[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/joconde_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&amp;FIELD_1=REF&amp;VALUE_1=M5037011289 Tomb of Philip Pot, Grand Seneschal of Burgundy]". Portal of the collections 
of the Museums of France. Retrieved 8 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The tomb was seized by the state during the [[French Revolution]], and sold in 1791 to the Duleu Society and Dardelin of Dijon.&lt;ref name="MoF" /&gt; It was acquired in 1808 by Charles Richard de Vesvrotte, lord of [[Ruffey-lès-Beaune]], following a legal case against the state. De Vesvrotte placed the tomb in the garden of his [[hôtel particulier]] (mansion) in Dijon, the [[Hôtel Petit de Ruffey]].  He then temporarily moved it to a castle grounds in his possession, and then relocated to another of his mansion's gardens. It passed to the French National Collections in 1899.&lt;ref name="ss158" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5257">'''"Ubangi Stomp"''' is an American [[rockabilly]] song. Written by Charles Underwood and first released on record by [[Warren Smith (singer)|Warren Smith]] in 1956, the song did not chart, but went on to become a rockabilly standard, covered by many artists. "Ubangi Stomp" – usually Smith's recording – appears on many compilation albums, including ''[[The Sun Records Collection]]'' and ''[[The Best of Bob Dylan's Theme Time Radio Hour]]''.

"Ubangi Stomp" is a straightforward [[uptempo]] [[rock and roll]] song; the lyrics, of no great literary depth ("''Ubangi stomp ubangi style / When the beat just drives a cool cat wild''"), tell in [[First-person narrative|first person]] the story of a sailor who goes to Africa ("''I rocked through Africa and... Seen them cats doin' the Ubangi stomp''") and, enamored of the local [[Sub-Saharan African music traditions|music]] and [[African dance|dance]], [[wikt:jump ship|jumps ship]] to [[wikt:go native|go native]] ("''Then the captain said son, we gotta go / I said that's alright, you go right ahead / I'm gonna Ubangi-stomp 'till I roll over dead''"). Some mixing of cultural stereotypes is seen when supposed Native American terms ("heap big", [[Tom-tom drum|tom-tom]]) are mixed into the ostensibly African setting.

The Ubangi Stomp Festival, an annual international exposition of America roots and rockabilly music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ubangistomp.com/en#page-home |title=Ubangi Stomp |publisher=American Roots Promotion |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes its name from the song, as does the Ubangi Stomp Club, a [[Dublin]] organization that organizes and promotes roots concerts and gigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cattytown.com/directory/listing/ubangi-stomp-club |title=Ubangi Stomp Club |work=Cattytown |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxophonist [[Earl Bostic]] released an instrumental piece titled "Ubangi Stomp" in 1954, but this has no relation to Underwood's song beyond the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tosches |first=Nick |title=Country: The Twisted Roots of Rock 'n' Roll |publisher=Da Capo Press |page=8 |year=1996

'''Variable-data publishing (VDP)''' (also known as [[database publishing]]) is a term referring to the output of a variable composition system.  While these systems can produce both electronically viewable and hard-copy (print) output, the "variable-data publishing" term today often distinguishes output destined for electronic viewing, rather than that which is destined for hard-copy print (e.g. [[variable data printing]]).

Essentially the same techniques are employed to perform variable-data publishing, as those utilized with variable data printing.  The difference is in the interpretation for output.  While variable-data printing may be interpreted to produce various print streams or page-description files (e.g. [[Advanced Function Presentation|AFP]]/[[IPDS]], [[PostScript]], [[Printer Command Language|PCL]]), variable-data publishing produces electronically viewable files, most commonly seen in the forms of [[PDF]], [[HTML]], or [[XML]].

Variable-data composition involves the use of data to conditionally:
* exhibit text (static blocks and/or variable content)
* exhibit images
* select fonts
* select colors
* format page layouts &amp; flows

Variable-data may be as simple as an address block or salutation. However, it can be any or all of the document's textual content—including words, sentences, paragraphs, pages, or the entire document.  In other words, it can make up as little or as much of the document as the composer desires.  Variable data may also be used to exhibit various images, such as logos, products, or membership photos.  Further, variable-data can be used to build rule-based design schemes, including fonts, colors, and page formats.  The possibilities are vast.

The variable-data tools available today, make it possible to perform variable-data composition at nearly every stage of document production.  However, the level of control that can be achieved varies, based upon how far into the document production process a variable-data tool is deployed.  For example, if variable-data insertion occurs just prior to output...it's not likely that the text flow or layout can be altered with nearly as much control as would be available at the time of initial document composition.

Many organizations will produce multiple forms of output (aka: multi-channel output), for the same document.  This ensures that the published content is available to recipients via any form of access method they might require.  When multi-channel output is utilized, integrity between those output channels often becomes important.

Variable-data publishing may be performed on everything from a [[personal computer]] to a [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] system.  However, the speed and practical output volumes which can be achieved are directly affected by the computer power utilized.

==Origin of the concept==

The term variable-data publishing was likely an offshoot of the term "variable-data printing", first introduced to the printing industry by Frank Romano, Professor Emeritus, School of Print Media, at the [[College of Imaging Arts and Sciences]] at [[Rochester Institute of Technology]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} However, the concept of merging static document elements and variable document elements predates the term and has seen various implementations ranging from simple desktop '[[mail merge]]', to complex [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] applications in the financial and banking industry. In the past, the term VDP has been most closely associated with digital printing machines. However, in the past 3 years the application of this technology has spread to web pages, emails, and mobile messaging.
