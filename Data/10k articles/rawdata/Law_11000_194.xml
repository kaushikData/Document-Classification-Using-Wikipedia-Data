{{Politics of the European Union}}
The '''area of freedom, security and justice''' ('''AFSJ''') is a collection of home affairs and justice policies designed to ensure security, rights and free movement within the [[European Union]] (EU). Areas covered include the harmonisation of private international law, extradition arrangements between member states, policies on internal and external border controls, common travel visa, immigration and asylum policies and police and judicial cooperation.

As internal borders have been removed within the EU, cross-border police cooperation has had to increase to counter cross-border crime. Some notable projects related to the area are the [[European Arrest Warrant]], the [[Schengen Area]] and [[Frontex]] patrols.

==Organisation==
The area comes under the purview of the [[European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship]] and the [[List of European Commission portfolios#Home Affairs|European Commissioner for Home Affairs]]. They deal with the following matters: [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizenship]]; combating discrimination, drugs, organised crime, terrorism, [[human trafficking]]; [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|free movement of people]], asylum and immigration; judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters; police and customs cooperation; and these matters in the [[Enlargement of the European Union|acceding countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/index_en.htm Summaries of EU legislation: Justice, freedom and security], [[Europa (web portal)]], accessed 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant [[European Commission]] departments are the [[Directorate-General for Justice (European Commission)|DG for Justice]] and the [[Directorate-General for Home Affairs (European Commission)|DG Home Affairs]]. However, there are also [[Eurojust]] and [[Europol]], which develop judicial and police cooperation respectively. Related to the latter there is also the [[European Police College]], the European Police Chiefs Task Force and [[Frontex]].

==Actions==
Over the years, the EU has developed a wide competence in the area of justice and home affairs. To this end, agencies have been established that co-ordinate associated actions: [[Europol]] for co-operation of police forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European police office now in full swing|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/police/europol/fsj_police_europol_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070829221522/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/police/europol/fsj_police_europol_en.htm| archivedate= 29 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurojust]] for co-operation between prosecutors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurojust coordinating cross-border prosecutions at EU level|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/eurojust/fsj_criminal_eurojust_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070912065520/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/eurojust/fsj_criminal_eurojust_en.htm| archivedate= 12 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frontex]] for co-operation between border control authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Frontex?|url=http://www.frontex.europa.eu/|author=Frontex|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070823060454/http://www.frontex.europa.eu/| archivedate= 23 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU also operates the [[Schengen Information System]]&lt;ref name="Internal borders"&gt;{{cite web |title=Abolition of internal borders and creation of a single EU external frontier |publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/freetravel/schengen/printer/fsj_freetravel_schengen_en.htm |accessdate=10 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities throughout the borderless [[Schengen Area]].

Furthermore, the Union has legislated in areas such as [[extradition]] (such as the [[European Arrest Warrant]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European arrest warrant replaces extradition between EU Member States|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/extradition/fsj_criminal_extradition_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=4 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012003934/http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/criminal/extradition/fsj_criminal_extradition_en.htm| archivedate= 12 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[family law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33194.htm|title=Jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility (Brussels II)|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; asylum law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l33150.htm|title=Minimum standards on the reception of applicants for asylum in Member States|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[criminal justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l10110.htm|title=Specific Programme: 'Criminal Justice'|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=5 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties.&lt;ref name="art39/141 Rome"&gt;See Articles 157 (ex Article 141) of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]. [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0001:01:EN:HTML Eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="art2(7) Amsterdam"&gt;See Article 2(7) of the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]]. [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/en/treaties/dat/11997D/htm/11997D.html#0001010001 Eur-lex.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on [[sexism|sexual discrimination]] in the work-place, [[ageism|age discrimination]], and [[racism|racial discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of [[Egalitarianism|equal treatment]] between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (OJ L 180, 19 July 2000, p. 22–26); Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (OJ L 303, 2 December 2000, p. 16–22).&lt;/ref&gt;

== European crimes ==
In 2006, a [[2006 Côte d'Ivoire toxic waste spill|toxic waste spill off the coast of Côte d'Ivoire]], from a European ship, prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste. [[European Commissioner for the Environment|Environment Commissioner]] [[Stavros Dimas]] stated that "Such highly toxic waste should never have left the European Union". With countries such as Spain not even having a law against shipping toxic waste [[Franco Frattini]], the [[Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security|Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner]], proposed with Dimas to create criminal sentences for "[[ecological crime]]s". His right to do this was contested in 2005 at the Court of Justice resulting in a victory for the Commission. That ruling set a precedent that the Commission, on a supranational basis, may legislate in criminal law. So far though, the only other use has been the [[Proposed directive on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights|intellectual property rights directive]].&lt;ref name="E!Sharp0507 Legal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Charter|first=David|title=A new legal environment|work=E!Sharp|pages=23–5|publisher=People Power Process|year=2007|url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motions were tabled in the European Parliament against that legislation on the basis that criminal law should not be an EU competence, but were rejected at vote.&lt;ref name="Piracy vote"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gargani|first=Giuseppe|authorlink=|title=Intellectual property rights: criminal sanctions to fight piracy and counterfeiting|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)|European Parliament]]|year=2007|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/057-4356-078-03-12-909-20070319IPR04284-19-03-2007-2007-false/default_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=30 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in October 2007 the Court of Justice ruled the Commission could not propose what the criminal sanctions could be, only that there must be some.&lt;ref name="EUO Oct"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mahony|first=Honor|authorlink=|title=EU court delivers blow on environment sanctions|work=|publisher=EU Observer|date=23 October 2007|url=http://euobserver.com/9/25028|format=|doi=|accessdate=23 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Commission has listed seven [[criminal offence|offence]]s that become European crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/criminal/criminal-law-policy/|title=Judicial cooperation|author=|date=|website=European Commission - European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seven crimes announced by the Commission are [[counterfeit]]ing euro notes and coins; credit card and [[cheque fraud]]; [[money laundering]]; [[people-trafficking]]; computer hacking and virus attacks; corruption in the private sector; and [[marine pollution]]. The possible future EU crimes are [[racial discrimination]] and [[incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|incitement to racial hatred]]; [[organ trade]]; and corruption in [[awarding public contract]]s. It will also set out the [[Sentence (law)|level of penalty]], such as length of [[prison sentence]], that would apply to each crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|author=|date=|website=thetimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first steps in security and justice cooperation within the EU began in 1975 when the [[TREVI]] group was created, composed of member states' justice and home affairs ministers. The first real cooperation was the signing of the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen Implementing Convention]] in 1990 which opened up the EU's internal borders and established the [[Schengen Area]]. In parallel the [[Dublin Regulation]] furthered police cooperation.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/comparl/libe/elsj/zoom_in/01_en.htm Area of Freedom, Security and Justice], [[European Parliament]], accessed 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooperation on policies such as immigration and police cooperation was formally introduced in the [[Maastricht Treaty]] which established [[Justice and Home Affairs]] (JHA) as one of the [[Three pillars of the European Union|EU's 'three pillars']]. The Justice and Home Affairs pillar was organised on an [[Intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] basis with little involvement of the EU supranational institutions such as the European Commission and the European Parliament. Under this pillar the EU created the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) in 1993 and [[Europol]] in 1995. In 1997 the EU adopted an action plan against organised crime and established the [[European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia]] (EUMC). In 1998 the [[European Judicial Network in criminal matters]] (EJN) was established.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The idea of an area of freedom, security and justice was introduced in May 1999, in the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], which stated that the EU must "maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is assured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating of crime."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Treaty of Amsterdam/Article 1|Article 1(5) of the Amsterdam Treaty]].&lt;/ref&gt; The first work programme putting this provision into effect was agreed at [[Tampere]], Finland in October 1999. Subsequently, the Hague programme, agreed in November 2004, set further objectives to be achieved between 2005 and 2010.&lt;ref name="Strengthening"&gt;[http://blade.eurodyn.com/justice_home/fsj/intro/fsj_intro_en.htm Strengthening the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice], [[European Commission]] July 2008, accessed 16 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Treaty of Amsterdam also transferred the areas of asylum, immigration and judicial cooperation in civil matters from the JHA to the European Community pillar, the remainder being renamed [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]] (PJCC).&lt;ref name="Glossary"&gt;[http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/freedom_security_justice_en.htm Glossary: Area of freedom, security and justice] [[Europa (web portal)]], accessed 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time further advancements were made. In 2000 the [[European Police College]] was created along with numerous conventions and agreements. The [[Treaty of Nice]] enshrined Eurojust in the EU treaties and in 2001 and 2002 [[Eurojust]], [[Eurodac]], the European Judicial Network in Civil and Commercial Matters (EJNCC) and European Crime Prevention Network (EUCPN) were established. In 2004 the EU appointed an anti-terrorism coordinator in response to the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]] and the [[European Arrest Warrant]] (agreed in 2002) entered into force.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

{{wikisource|Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Title V: Area of Freedom, Security and Justice|TFEU: Title V: Area of Freedom, Security and Justice}}

The 2009 [[Treaty of Lisbon]] abolished the pillar structure, reuniting the areas separated at Amsterdam. The [[European Parliament]] and [[Court of Justice of the European Union|Court of Justice]] gained a say over the whole area while the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] changed to majority voting for the remaining PJCC matters. The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] also gained legal force and Europol was brought within the EU's legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/en/security/eu-achieve-area-freedom-security-justice/article-110181 Can the EU achieve an area of freedom, security and justice?], EurActive October 2003, accessed 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; As the Treaty of Lisbon came into force, the [[European Council]] adopted the [[Stockholm Programme]] to provide EU action on developing the area over the following five years.&lt;ref name="Strengthening"/&gt;

==Justice==
There has been criticism that the EU's activities have been too focused on security and not on justice.&lt;ref&gt;Verbeet, Markus (19 March 2008) [http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,542017,00.html Interview with EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini: 'The Problem Is not Data Storage, It's Terrorism'] [[Der Spiegel]], accessed 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarahludfordmep.org.uk/news/001227/european_arrest_warrant_does_not_overrule_human_rights.html European Arrest Warrant does not overrule human rights] [[Sarah Ludford]] 2 June 2009, accessed 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the EU created the [[European Arrest Warrant]] but no common rights for defendants arrested under it. With the strengthened powers under Lisbon, the second [[Barroso Commission]] created a dedicated [[European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship|commissioner for justice]] (previously combined with security under one portfolio) who is obliging member states to provide reports on their implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Furthermore, the Commission is putting forward proposals for common rights for defendants (such as interpretation), minimum standards for prison conditions and ensure that victims of crime are taken care of properly wherever they are in the EU. This is intended to create a common judicial area where each system can be sure of trusting each other.&lt;ref&gt;Engerer, Cyrus (22 March 2010) [http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=103227 Justice across Borders: Freedom, security and justice in the EU], Malta Independent Online, accessed 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opt-outs==
[[File:Area of freedom, security and justice participation.svg|thumb|{{legend|#0088cc|States which fully participate}} {{legend|#ffbbbb|States with an opt-out that can opt-in on a case-by-case basis}}{{legend|#ff6666|States with an opt-out}}]]
Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom all have various [[Opt-outs in the European Union|opt-outs]] from the border control, asylum policy, police and judicial cooperation provisions that are part of the area of freedom, security and justice. While Ireland and the United Kingdom have opt-ins that allow them to participate in legislation on a case-by-case basis, Denmark is fully outside the area of freedom, security and justice.

==Broadening security and safety perspective==
The European Union's growing role in coordinating internal security and safety policies is only partly captured by looking at policymaking within the area of freedom, security and justice. Across the EU's other (former) pillars, initiatives related to food security, health safety, infrastructure protection, counter-terrorism and energy security can be found. New perspectives and concepts have been introduced to examine the EU's wider internal security role for the EU, such as the EU's "protection policy space"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/07036330600979573 | volume=28 | title=Protecting the Union: Analysing an Emerging Policy Space | year=2006 | journal=Journal of European Integration | pages=405–421 | last1 = Boin | first1 = Arjen | last2 = Ekengren | first2 = Magnus | last3 = Rhinard | first3 = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; or internal "security governance".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/EU_Security_Governance.html?id=Lfk4rllRV-IC&amp;redir_esc=y Kirchner, Emil and Sperling, James (2008) EU Security Governance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14631">'''Article 10''' of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] guarantees [[Malaysia]]n [[Malaysian citizenship|citizens]] the right to [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of assembly]] and [[freedom of association]]. Unlike comparable provisions in [[constitutional law]] such as the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], Article 10 entitles citizens to such freedoms as are not restricted by the government, instead of absolutely guaranteeing those freedoms.

==Article 10==
# Subject to Clauses (2), (3) and (4) —
#* (a) every citizen has the right to freedom of speech and expression;
#* (b) all citizens have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms;
#* (c) all citizens have the right to form associations.
# [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]] may by law impose —
#* (a) on the rights conferred by paragraph (a) of Clause (1), such restrictions as it deems necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of the Federation or any part thereof, [[Foreign relations of Malaysia|friendly relations]] with other countries, [[social order|public order]] or [[public morality|morality]] and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or of any Legislative Assembly or to provide against contempt of court, defamation, or incitement to any offence;
#* (b) on the right conferred by paragraph (b) of Clause (1), such restrictions as it deems necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of the Federation or any part thereof, or public order;
#* (c) on the right conferred by paragraph (c) of Clause (1), such restrictions as it deems necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of the Federation or any part thereof, public order or morality.
# Restrictions on the right to form associations conferred by paragraph (c) of Clause (1) may also be imposed by any law relating to [[Economy of Malaysia|labour]] or [[Education in Malaysia|education]].
# In imposing restrictions in the interest of the security of the Federation or any part thereof or public order under Clause (2) (a), Parliament may pass law prohibiting the questioning of any matter, right, status, position, privilege, sovereignty or prerogative established or protected by the provisions of Part III, [[Article 152 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 152]], [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 153]] or [[Article 181 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 181]] otherwise than in relation to the implementation thereof as may be specified in such law.

==History==

===Drafting===
The Constitution of the independent [[Federation of Malaya]] — which later merged with [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] to form Malaysia — was drafted by the [[Reid Commission]], a body of eminent jurists from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In its report, the Commission recommended that the Constitution protect "certain fundamental individual rights which are as essential conditions for a free and [[democracy|democratic]] way of life". Although the commissioners avoided recommending that these rights be [[entrenchment clause|entrenched]] — finding that they were "...all firmly established in Malaya"&lt;ref&gt;[[Rais Yatim|Yatim, Rais]] (1995). ''Freedom Under Executive Power in Malaysia: A Study of Executive Supremacy'', p. 77. Endowment Publications. {{ISBN|983-99984-0-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; — they nevertheless felt that in light of "vague apprehensions about the future", it would be well to provide some constitutional safeguards for these rights. The "vague apprehensions" were mainly those of the non-Malays, who feared that an independent Malaya would be dominated politically by the [[Malay people|Malays]] (see ''[[ketuanan Melayu]]''). The Reid Commission thus recommended that the rights "...should be guaranteed in the Constitution and the [[courts of Malaysia|courts]] should have the power of enforcing these rights".&lt;ref&gt;Yatim, pp. 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The draft Constitution prepared by the Commission included an Article 10 largely similar to the one eventually included in the final Constitution. However, the draft first clause differed in one important respect:

{{quote|Every citizen shall have the right to freedom of speech and expression, subject to any ''reasonable'' (emphasis added) restriction imposed by federal law in the interest of the security of the Federation, friendly relations with other countries, public order, or morality or in relation to [[contempt of court]], [[defamation]] or incitement to any offence.&lt;ref&gt;Yatim, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The other clauses covering freedom of assembly and association also similarly referred to a "reasonable restriction". Justice Abdul Hamid of [[Pakistan]], a member of the Commission, wrote a strong dissenting view that was included in the final report of the Commission. His dissent criticised, among others, the draft versions of [[Article 4 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 4]] and Article 10.&lt;ref&gt;Yatim, pp. 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamid objected to the inclusion of the word "reasonable", stating:

{{quote|If the word ''reasonable'' is allowed to stand, every legislation on this subject will be challenged in court on the ground that the restrictions imposed by the legislature are not reasonable. This will in many cases give rise to conflict between the views of the legislature and the views of the court on the reasonableness of the restrictions. To avoid this situation it is better to make the legislature be the judge of the reasonableness of the restrictions... There will always be a fear that the court may hold the restrictions imposed by it to be unreasonable. The laws would be lacking in certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Yatim, pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Final version===
The Working Committee established by the autonomous Federation's government adopted nearly all of Hamid's recommendations in his dissent, thereby eliminating the possibility of [[judicial review]] concerning the reasonableness of laws which infringed on the rights granted by Article 10. One legal commentator has stated:

{{quote|It hardly needs to be said that without Justice Hamid's dissent on this point, the three freedoms under Article 10 would have been more satisfactorily guarded by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Yatim, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Lord William Reid]], who chaired the Commission, said that:

{{quote|...a greater part of the changes have been in the direction of giving more freedom to the [[executive branch|executive]] and Parliament of Malaya and correspondingly less extensive guarantees of individual rights that we had recommended. I cannot speak for my colleagues but speaking for myself I am not dismayed at the changes which have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Yatim, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the debate over the draft Constitution in the [[Federal Legislative Council]], [[K.L. Devaser]], an [[Barisan Nasional|Alliance]] government [[backbencher]], criticised the changes, arguing:

{{quote|...the draft Constitutional proposals take away the right of the court of law because the government can decide what is necessary and expedient, whereas the Reid Commission Report gives power to the court of law and the court of law can say that it is not in the interest of security of the Federation. As a [[lawyer]] I do feel that the right of the subject is much better safeguarded if the last say is in the court of law rather than in the hands of the executive authority...&lt;ref&gt;Yatim, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Over his objections, the Legislative Council approved the modified draft. This version of the Constitution, which contained an Article 10 much more similar to the present day version, also included a new Article 4(2) which provides that "The validity of any law shall not be questioned on the ground that...it imposes such restrictions as are mentioned in Article 10(2)". In light of these changes, a Malaysian lawyer has argued that "It is clear ... that freedoms of ... speech, assembly and association (Article 10) were intended to be restricted ''[[Ab initio]]''."&lt;ref&gt;Yatim, pp. 68, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Several acts of law regulate the freedoms granted by Article 10, such as the [[Official Secrets Act (Malaysia)|Official Secrets Act]], which makes it a crime to disseminate information classified as an official secret. The [[Sedition Act (Malaysia)|Sedition Act]] 1948 makes it an offence to engage in acts with a "[[sedition|seditious]] tendency", including but not limited to the spoken word and publications; conviction may result in a sentence of a fine up to [[Ringgit|RM]]5,000, three years in jail, or both. The Public Order (Preservation) Ordinance 1958 allows the [[Royal Malaysian Police|Police]] to declare certain areas "restricted", and to regulate processions or meetings of five persons or more. The maximum [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] for the violation of a restricted area order is imprisonment of 10 years and whipping.&lt;ref&gt;Means, Gordon P. (1991). ''Malaysian Politics: The Second Generation'', pp. 142–143, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-588988-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other laws curtailing the freedoms of Article 10 are the [[Police (Malaysia) Act 1967|Police Act 1967]], which criminalises the gathering of three or more people in a public place without a licence, and the [[Printing Presses and Publications Act]] 1984, which grants the Home Affairs Minister "absolute discretion" in the granting and revoking of publishing permits, and also makes it a criminal offense to possess a [[printing press]] without a licence.&lt;ref&gt;Rachagan, S. Sothi (1993). ''Law and the Electoral Process in Malaysia'', pp. 163, 169–170. Kuala Lumpur: University of Malaya Press. {{ISBN|967-9940-45-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sedition Act in particular has been widely commented upon by jurists for the bounds it places on freedom of speech. Justice Raja [[Azlan Shah]] (later the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]]) once said:

{{quote|The right to free speech ceases at the point where it comes within the mischief of the Sedition Act.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Bhag (Dec. 12, 2006). [http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=1287 Seditious speeches]. ''Malaysia Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2009, the government announced it was considering amendment of several laws which impinge upon freedom of speech, including the controversial [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] (ISA), which has been used to detain numerous politicians and activists without trial. Home Minister [[Hishammuddin Hussein]], accompanied by Inspector-General of Police [[Musa Hassan]], Attorney General [[Abdul Gani Patail]], Information, Communication, and Culture Minister [[Rais Yatim]], and Minister in the Prime Minister's Department [[Nazri Aziz]], told the press that the ISA, [[Police (Malaysia) Act 1967|Police Act]], Multimedia and Communications Act, the Restrictive Residence Ordinance, and the Emergency Ordinance would be reviewed with an eye to relaxing restrictions on freedom of speech. Rais also said that the [[Police (Malaysia) Act 1967|Police Act]] would include provisions allowing peaceful assembly in certain designated places such as stadiums, without the need to obtain a permit from the police. The government plans to table amendments to these laws during the October sitting of Parliament, and pass them by December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Kuang Keng | last=Kuek Ser | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Coming soon: A lenient ISA, rallies without permits | date=2009-08-19 | publisher= | url =http://malaysiakini.com/news/110939 | work =Malaysiakini | pages = | accessdate = 2009-08-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal criticism==
Legal scholars have suggested that compared to other fundamental liberties set out in Part II of the Constitution, the freedoms of speech, association and assembly are easily abridged by both the executive and legislative branches of the government. Most of these freedoms, such as freedom from [[slavery]], [[double jeopardy]], etc., are not subjected to the same exclusions as set out in Article 10(2), (3) and (4). Instead, they are rights which are guaranteed without any qualification. The rights of Article 10 are subject to the exclusions of the aforementioned clauses.&lt;ref&gt;Yatim, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Articles [[Article 149 of the Constitution of Malaysia|149]] and [[Article 150 of the Constitution of Malaysia|150]], during a [[state of emergency]], the executive is granted the power to legislate, even if the resulting laws contravene the Constitution; however, this power does not extend to any matter pertaining to [[Sharia|Islamic law]], Malay customs, the customs of the indigenous peoples of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]], [[Status of religious freedom in Malaysia|religion]] in general, citizenship, and language.&lt;ref&gt;Means, pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; In light of this, one scholar ([[Shad Saleem Faruqi]]) has gone as far as to argue that:

{{quote|...the only genuinely safeguarded provisions of the Constitution are not those contained in Part II but those given under Article 150(6A). They enjoy greater sanctity and are more entrenched in the Constitution than any other rights.&lt;ref&gt;Yatim, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been remarked that although the "fundamental" rights of Article 10 were not entrenched, other portions of the Constitution — namely those related to the [[Malaysian social contract]] such as those provisions concerning the national language of [[Malay language|Malay]], the national religion of [[Islam]], the position of the [[Malay rulers]], the special position of the [[Malay people|Malay majority]], and citizenship — were entrenched. These provisions may only be amended with the consent of the [[Conference of Rulers]] — a body comprising the Malay rulers and the Governors of those states without a monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Yatim, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; In criticising the Reid Commission's finding that the freedoms of Article 10 were "all firmly established in Malaya" prior to independence, it has been suggested that:

{{quote|...these basic rights had not been clearly formulated or seen as being concrete and traditional. In contrast, what were really regarded as 'traditional elements' of the Constitution were matters of citizenship (Part III), the special position of the Malays ([[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 153]]), the national (Malay) language (Article 152), and the sovereign rights of the Rulers (Article 181).&lt;ref&gt;Yatim, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Bavarian State Library''' ({{lang-de|'''Bayerische Staatsbibliothek'''}}, abbreviated '''BSB''', called '''''Bibliotheca Regia Monacensis''''' before  [[1919]]) in [[Munich]] is the central "Landesbibliothek", i. e. the state [[library]] of the Free State of [[Bavaria]] and one of Europe's most important universal libraries. With its collections currently comprising around 10.36 million books (as of 2016), it ranks among the best research libraries worldwide. Moreover, its historical stock encompasses one of the most important manuscript collections of the world, the largest collection of [[incunabula]] worldwide, as well as numerous further important special collections.

The legal deposit law has been in force since 1663, regulating that two copies of every printed work published in Bavaria have to be submitted to the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek. This law is still applicable today. The Bayerische Staatsbibliothek furthermore is Europe's second-largest journals library (after the [[British Library]]). The BSB publishes the specialist journal Bibliotheksforum Bayern and has been publishing the Bibliotheksmagazin together with the Berlin State Library since 2007. Its building is situated in the [[Ludwigstrasse (Munich)|Ludwigstrasse]].

===Main departments===

====Central Administration====
The central administration is in charge of general administrative management; moreover, it acts as a service provider for all areas of the library. The department is responsible for the areas "budget", "human resources" and "internal services, construction".

====Collection Development and Cataloguing====
This department acquires all types of media (in the form or by way of presents, purchase, licensing, deposit copies and swapping items), and catalogues and indexes them both formally and according to subject. The Munich Digitisation Centre is a section of the department. It handles the digitisation and online publication of the cultural heritage preserved by the Bavarian State Library and by other institutions. It provides one of the largest and fastest growing digital collections in Germany. The department is also responsible for conservation and collection care. This division protects the media published from the year 1850 onward against damage and decay. It secures their long-term availability.

====User Services====
The user services department acts as an agent of the collections and services of the library. The department consists of the divisions of document provision, document administration, document delivery and information- and reading-room services.

====Manuscripts and Early Printed Books====
The department of manuscripts and early printed books is responsible for the most valuable historical collections of the library. The worldwide renown of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek is founded on this precious heritage. The department has a separate reading room that is specially equipped for working with old books.

===Special Departments===

====Map Collection and Image Archive====
This department administrates printed maps from the year 1500 up to the present, atlases, cartographic material and the image archive of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek. The image archive also includes parts of the archives of [[Heinrich Hoffmann (photographer)|Heinrich Hoffmann]], Bernhard Johannes and Felicitas Timpe. The Map Collection and Image Archive also have - together with the department of music -their own reading room.

====Department of Music====
The Department of Music ranks among the world's leading music libraries, due to both the quantity and quality of its historical collections and its broad acquisition profile. Its beginnings date back to the 16th century. The area of collection emphasis "musicology" of the [[German Research Foundation]] is overseen by this department. A special reading room for music, maps and images is provided for the library users.

Users can avail themselves of the open-access collections in the east reading room occupied together with the department of Eastern Europe.

====Department of Eastern Europe (Osteuropaabteilung)====
The department of Eastern Europe is the largest special department of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, holding around one million books about and from Eastern Europe, from early modern times up to the 21st century. In addition to the eastern European area, it also addresses eastern central and south-eastern Europe as well as the Asian part of Russia. The open-access collection of the department is accommodated in the library's east reading room.

===Departments in Charge of Predominantly Regional-Level Tasks===
The departments in charge of tasks predominantly allocated to a regional level are the Bayerische Bibliotheksschule (Bavarian School of Library and Information Science), the Landesfachstelle für das öffentliche Bibliothekswesen (Consulting Centre for Public Libraries) as well as the head office of the Bibliotheksverbund Bayern (Bavarian Library Network).

===State-Funded Bavarian Regional Libraries===
The Bavarian regional state-funded libraries form part of Bavaria's academic library system. They are subordinated to the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in the organisation structure. Among these libraries are the state libraries of [[Amberg]], [[Ansbach]], [[Neuburg an der donau|Neuburg an der Donau]], [[Passau]] and [[Regensburg]], the Studienbibliothek [[Dillingen, Bavaria|Dillingen]], the Landesbibliothek [[Coburg]], the [[Bamberg State Library]] ({{lang-de|Staatsbibliothek Bamberg}}) as well as the Hofbibliothek [[Aschaffenburg]].

==History==
The library was founded in 1558 as the court library of [[Albert V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Albrecht V]], and was originally located in the vaulted chamber of the Alter Hof (old court) of the Munich residence. Initially, two book collections were acquired: on the one hand the personal papers of the Austrian jurist, orientalist and imperial chancellor [[Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter]], consisting of oriental manuscripts and prints, editions of classic authors and works from the areas of theology, philosophy und jurisprudence, and on the other hand the collection of the Augsburg patrician Johann Jakob Fugger, which was acquired in 1571. [[Fugger]] had commissioned agents to collect volumes of manuscripts and printed works in Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. In the end the works collected in this way amounted to more than 10,000 volumes. At the same time, he had had manuscripts copied in Venice.

Apart from this, in 1552 Fugger had purchased the collection of manuscripts and incunabula of the physician and humanist [[Hartmann Schedel]], representing one of the richest humanistic [[private library|private libraries]] north of the [[Alps]]. The Fugger collection was first administrated and organised by the physician Samuel Quichelberg from Antwerp. He had adopted the shelving system of the Augsburg court library. Later the collection was administered by the librarian Wolfgang Prommer, who had catalogued the collection both alphabetically and according to keywords. Aegidius Oertel from Nuremberg became the first librarian in 1561. The main users of the library were the Jesuits, who had been invited to Munich in 1559.

[[William V, Duke of Bavaria|William V]] continued the collection, making further purchases:
*Spanish prints from the personal papers of the Tyrolean knight Anselm Stöckel (1583)
*The collection of the Augsburg councillor Johann Heinrich Herwarth von Hohenberg comprising numerous music prints (1585)
*Humanistic library of the canon of Augsburg and Eichstätt [[Johann Georg von Werdenstein]] (1592)
In 1600 the collection comprised 17,000 volumes.

The [[German Mediatisation#Secularisation|secularization]] of Bavaria and the transfer of the court library of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] around the year 1803 added approximately 550,000 volumes and 18,600 manuscripts to the library's holdings.

In 1827 [[Friedrich von Gärtner]] was commissioned to plan a representative building for the court- and state library. The original plan was to erect the building at [[Ludwigstrasse]] 1. In 1828 the plot opposite the [[Glyptothek]] on Königsplatz was chosen as location, but later in the same year the planners switched back again to Ludwigstrasse. The blueprints were completed in 1831. For lack of funds the laying of the foundation stone had to be postponed to 8 July 1832. The construction work on the building planned by Gärtner was concluded in 1843.

In 1919 the library received the name that it still bears today: Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.

During the [[Second World War]] more than 500,000 volumes were lost, although the collections were partly evacuated from the building. Some of the books were for example stored in the palace chapel of [[Schloss Haimhausen]]. Of the building itself 85% were destroyed. The reconstruction of the library building and the reintegration of evacuated holdings started in 1946.

1953-1966 the professors Hans Döllgast und [[Sep Ruf]] had to plan and realize the reconstruction of the eastern wing, a new area behind historic walls, and the extension building of the Bavarian State Library, a glass- steel frame construction for the bibliotheca. They made an available surface of 17.000 m² and a cubature of 84.000 m³. 1967 a jury with [[Hans Scharoun]] gave the price of the BDA Bayern to the extension building. The inauguration of the restored south wing of the building in 1970 marked the conclusion of the reconstruction work on the building.

The Speicherbibliothek [[Garching]] (book repository) was inaugurated in 1988.

The Bayerische Staatsbibliothek has also initiated large-scale internet projects. In 1997 the Munich Digitization Center took up work and the BSB started developing its web portals, including its own web site. The card catalogue 1841-1952 and the catalogue of incunabula 1450-1500 were converted, thus making the complete holdings of printed materials of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek available online. The service "Digitisation on Demand", offered by a network of several European libraries, makes millions of books published between 1500 and 1900 available in digital form.

On 7 March 2007 Director General Rolf Griebel announced that [[Google Book Search]] will take over the digitisation of the [[copyright]]-free holdings of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek. In 2008, the year of its 450th anniversary, the Deutscher Bibliotheksverband (German Library Association) awarded the title of Bibliothek des Jahres (Library of the year) to the BSB.

In 2012 an Italian scholar discovered among Johann Jakob Fugger's manuscripts in the library an 11th-century Greek [[codex]] containing 29 ancient homilies, previously unpublished, by the theologian [[Origen]] of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alinsuciu.com/2012/06/11/the-rediscovery-of-the-origens-homilies-to-the-psalms-bayerische-staatsbibliothek-cod-graec-314/ The Rediscovery of Origen's Homilies on the Psalms (Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Cod. graec. 314)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restitution==
Since 2003 the Bavarian State Library has gone to great efforts to restitute illegally-acquired library material. The most recent example is the [[restitution]] of the so-called Plock Pontifical to Poland in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Übergabe des Pontificale an polnische Kirche als Symbol der Verständigung und des Miteinanders" - Bayerns Wissenschaftsminister Spaenle übergibt das "Plocker Pontificale" aus dem 12. Jahrhundert in Warschau an den polnischen Bischof Libera|url=http://www.km.bayern.de/pressemitteilung/9467/nr-119-vom-15-04-2015.html|publisher=Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Bildung und Kultus, Wissenschaft und Kunst|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been stolen by the Nazis from the [[Plock]] Bishopric in 1940 and was taken to the Koenigsberg University. The Bavarian State Library bought the manuscript in 1973 for 6,200 DM at an auction in Munich. In the past years, the library has searched through those segments of its collections that are in question for illegitimate purchases. All in all, over 60,000 books have been meticulously checked so far. The library has identified around 500 books whose acquisition is to be regarded as unlawful. Subsequently, to these findings, several restitutions have taken place, amongst others the Bavarian State Library returned 78 volumes originating from [[Thomas Mann]]’s research library to the Thomas Mann Archive in Zürich in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NS-Raubgut an der BSB|url=http://www.bayerische-landesbibliothek-online.de/bsbforschung|website=Bayerische Landesbibliothek Online|publisher=Bayerische Staatsbibliothek|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further restitutions are in preparation, for example 252 books from the former publishing house Geca Kon.

The '''bedding ceremony''' refers to the [[wedding]] custom of putting the [[newlywed]] couple together in the marital bed before numerous witnesses, thereby completing the [[marriage]]. In most traditions the newlyweds were put in bed by their family, friends, and neighbors.

The purpose of the ritual was to establish the [[consummation]] of the marriage, either by actually witnessing the couple's first [[sexual intercourse]] or symbolically, by leaving before consummation. It symbolized the [[community]]'s involvement in the marriage. The legally binding nature of the ceremony varied greatly from place to place and through time.

==Traditions==
[[File:Brauysegen im Bett.gif|thumb|Reymont and Melusina blessed by the bishop in their bed on their wedlock, 15th-century woodcut]]
[[File:Carl X Gustav of Sweden &amp; Hedwig Eleanor of Sweden c 1654 by Juriaen Ovens.jpg|thumb|After the wedding in 1654 between [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] and [[Hedvig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp]].]]

Bedding rituals have been practiced in various cultures, the ceremony differing from place to place. The people putting the newlyweds in bed have usually included their family, friends and wider community.{{sfn|Bailey|Barclay|2017|p=44}} The ritual is often associated with music, bawdy songs and jokes. It symbolised the community's involvement in the marriage and especially in the couple's [[sexual intimacy]], but also their [[marital fidelity]]. The consummation itself, i.e. the couple's first [[sexual intercourse]], was not witnessed in most of [[Western Europe]].{{sfn|Bailey|Barclay|2017|p=45}}

In England, the ceremony usually began with a priest [[Christian blessing|blessing]] the bed, after which the newlyweds prepared themselves for bed and drank [[sweet wine|sweet]] and [[spicy wine]]. The [[groomsmen]] and the [[bridesmaid]]s then sat on the sides of the bed and threw the couple's [[stocking]]s at them; a hit was believed to indicate that the thrower would soon marry. Finally the curtains were drawn around the bed and the couple were left alone. Some newlyweds refused to take part in the bedding ceremony. [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] of England ({{reign|1625|1649}}) notably barred the door of his bedroom; however, despite his rejection, the custom remained prevalent for another century among all social classes, including the royal family.{{sfn|Monger|2004|p=23}}{{refn|The bedding ritual was fully observed at the wedding of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]'s niece and nephew, [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and [[William III of England|William]], with the King himself drawing the curtains.{{sfn|Monger|2004|p=24}}|group=nb}}

In the 16th century, in what is now Germany, the bedding ceremony was performed to the sound of [[Pipe (instrument)|pipes]], [[drums]] and "obscene noises", after which the couple were left alone and the guests continued celebrating loudly enough for the newlyweds not to be heard. In many places, the newlyweds were dressed for bed separately by their family or community and then led to the bedroom.{{sfn|Bailey|Barclay|2017|p=44}} In others, the couple were expected to rejoin the party afterwards.{{sfn|Korpiolla|2009|p=61}} During the [[Reformation era]], the bedding ceremony was associated with rituals that assigned socioeconomic rights and duties to the bride as [[housewife]].{{sfn|Bailey|Barclay|2017|p=45}}

In [[Scandinavia]], it was the most distinguished wedding guest who led the bride to bed in a festive procession.{{refn|The [[Mayor of Stockholm]] led the bride {{circa}} 1416. In 1528, the Swedish king [[Gustav Vasa]] performed the role at the wedding of his trusted servant.{{sfn|Korpiolla|2009|p=61}}|group=nb}} After putting them in bed, the guests offered dishes to the couple and quickly ate with them before leaving them alone. Due to the ritual's importance, specially decorated wedding beds were sometimes borrowed from friends, family or neighbours. The bedding eventually became merely symbolic, with the bride's parents covering the newlyweds with a blanket and then uncovering them.{{sfn|Korpiolla|2009|p=61}}

==Legal consequences==
The original purpose of the bedding ceremony was to establish the [[consummation]] of the marriage, without which the union could be [[annulled]]. The legally binding nature of the ritual was unclear to many, particularly to lower classes. One marriage in Britain was annulled on the pretext that the bride had run away within 15 minutes of the ritual, and in another case, a clandestine marriage was made public when the pregnant wife shared her husband's deathbed.{{sfn|Stone|1992|p=22}} Public bedding in 18th-century Britain was widely believed to give additional legitimacy to the marriage.{{sfn|Stone|1992|p=163}} In Scotland, although marriage was formed by simple consent and required no formalities or consummation,{{sfn|Bailey|Barclay|2017|p=47}} the bedding rituals were widespread but unstructured; a couple simply wanted someone to see them in bed together. A couple could also be pressured into marriage in this way: a person stumbling upon an unmarried couple in bed could pronounce them man and wife on the spot.{{sfn|Bailey|Barclay|2017|p=48}}

In medieval Scandinavia, the bedding ceremony was of great legal importance. Laws in many [[Swedish province]]s regarded public bedding as essential to the completion of a marriage,{{sfn|Korpiolla|2009|p=60}} but the legal importance later diminished due to new royal laws.{{sfn|Korpiolla|2009|p=61}} In Iceland, a marriage was only valid if it included the bedding ritual witnessed by at least six men.{{sfn|Korpiolla|2009|p=62}}

In the case of royal marriages, the ceremony took on added significance.

==In popular culture==
The bedding ritual has featured in popular culture for centuries. It has been hinted at in ''The Penny Wedding'', an 1818 painting by [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]], and possibly also in the homonymous 1819 painting by [[Alexander Carse]]. Numerous songs also make references to the ceremony.{{sfn|Bailey|Barclay|2017|p=47}}

In the television series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', a bedding ceremony features in several episodes. It is conceived as a "[[Westeros]]i tradition following the wedding feast", wherein the attendees forcibly undress and carry the newlyweds to their bed. The intention is to "celebrate a marriage's consummation".{{sfn|Lucas|2015}}

[[File:Brothers_in_Law_(novel).jpg|thumb|First edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. [[Michael Joseph (publisher)|Michael Joseph]])]]
'''''Brothers in Law''''' is a 1955 [[comic novel]] by British author [[Henry Cecil Leon|Henry Cecil]], himself a [[County Court]] judge, about Roger Thursby — a young barrister — experiencing his first year in chambers.

==Plot summary==
At the age of 21, Roger Thursby has just completed his barrister's examinations and has been [[Called to the Bar]]. He commences his [[pupillage]] in the chambers of Mr Kendall Grimes, but finds he learns more from Henry, his colleague, and fellow pupils Peter and Charles, to say nothing of Alec, the chambers clerk. Although supposed to 'shadow' Grimes, he finds himself on his feet before a judge within a few days, all at sea on a knotty legal point.

Roger lives with his slightly vague widowed Mother, and also balances the affections of two girlfriends, Sally and Joy. Joy obtains his first brief for him from her uncle, a solicitor; an undefended [[divorce]] case, which Roger manages to lose, to the lady's fury.

Roger slowly gains more experience and confidence. He is given a "dock brief"; a case of fraud. Despite the odd behaviour of his client, Roger gets him off.

As his period as a pupil comes to its end, Henry leaves to take a position in another set of Chambers, and Roger considers joining him.

==Adaptations==
===Television and film===
In 1957 the book was [[Brothers in Law (film)|made into a film]] starring [[Ian Carmichael]] and [[Terry-Thomas]] directed by [[Roy Boulting]]. A curiosity about this film is that [[Eric Barker]] won a BAFTA as 'Most Promising Newcomer' for his role as a barrister's clerk, even though he had appeared in a number of other films, and had enjoyed an illustrious radio career.

In 1962, [[Frank Muir]] and [[Denis Norden]] adapted the book as [[Brothers in Law (TV series)|a television series]] featuring an early performance by [[Richard Briers]] in the leading role, though [[Richard Waring (writer)|Richard Waring]] wrote five of the thirteen episodes. The series also spawned a spin-off ''[[Mr Justice Duncannon]]'', also written by Cecil.

===Radio===
There were also two radio adaptations, one in 1955 starring [[Donald Sinden]], and in 1970 in which Briers reprised the role. The latter radio series by the BBC ran for thirty nine episodes in three series. They were adaptations by Richard Waring of the TV series. The cast included [[John Glyn-Jones]] (Grimes, Roger's pupil master) with [[Julia Lockwood]] (Sally) and [[Bridget Armstrong]] (Joy) as the women in Roger's life.

[[File:AL Governments.PNG|thumb|[[Arab League]] governments]]
The '''Charter of the Arab League''' (also known as the '''Pact of the League of Arab States''') is the founding treaty of the [[Arab League]]. Concluded in 1945, the agreement endorses the principle of an Arab [[homeland]] while respecting the sovereignty of the individual member states. The internal regulations of the [[Council of the Arab League]] and the committees were agreed to in October 1951. Those of the [[Secretary-General of the Arab League|Secretary-General]] were agreed to in May 1953.

Since then, governance of the Arab League has been based on the duality of supra-national institutions and the sovereignty of its member states. Preservation of individual statehood derived its strengths from the natural preference of ruling elites to maintain their power and independence in decision making. Moreover, the fear of the richer that the poorer may share their wealth in the name of Arab nationalism, the feuds among Arab rulers, and the influence of external powers that might oppose Arab unity can be seen as obstacles towards a deeper integration of the league.

The Charter was concluded on 22 March 1945 by the governments of [[Syria]], [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], and [[North Yemen]]. A state joins the Arab League by ratifying the Pact.

According to the Charter, "the League of Arab States shall be composed of the: independent Arab States that have signed this Pact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pact of the League of Arab States, March 22, 1945|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/arableag.asp|publisher=Yale Law School|accessdate=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially, [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] is the only autonomous entity in the Arab League, but several countries view Palestine as an autonomous entity within [[Israel]]. The Palestinian Authority exercises certain sovereign powers within its borders, but is not a fully independent government.{{Citation needed| date=November 2011}}  The Palestinian Authority administrated territories are internationally recognized as [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied by Israel]]. The Arab League on the other hand recognizes the [[State of Palestine]] as a fully independent state, with Jerusalem as its capital and with embassies in all of the other League member states, with the exception of Somalia.

'''''Chicago Board of Trade v. United States''''', 246 U.S. 231 (1918), was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] applied the "[[rule of reason]]" to the internal trading rules of a [[commodity market]]. Section 1 of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890|Sherman Act]] flatly states: "Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal."&lt;ref&gt;Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, § 1 (excerpt).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in evaluating the U.S. government's allegations that the [[Chicago Board of Trade]]'s rules on grain prices violated the Act, the Supreme Court rejected a strict interpretation of its language: "The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition."

==Facts==
Defendant [[Chicago Board of Trade]] (CBOT) is a [[commodity market]], dealing in [[Spot price|spot sales]] (sales of grain stored in Chicago and ready for delivery), [[Futures contract|future sales]] (grain to be purchased for delivery at a later time), and “[[Forward contract|to arrive]]” orders (grain which is en route to Chicago).  CBOT introduced a new “call rule” which regulated board members buying or selling sales of “to arrive” orders—at the close of the call session (which at that point was 2:00 p.m [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]), the price of grain is set and dealers can’t sell grain at any other price.  The [[United States Department of Justice]] accused CBOT of [[price-fixing]], and in 1913, filed suit against the Board in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois]].

At trial, CBOT asserted that the rule did not have any unlawful purpose, but rather was set up to curb certain pre-existing problems and abuses.  CBOT claimed that a group of agents were lowering discounts on commissions to those people buying grain after hours.  These agents would wait until after hours, and then buyers would get cheaper prices.  CBOT wanted to curb the power of these [[monopsony]]/[[oligopsony]] type of buyers by making prices the same for everyone after hours.  Also, the rule shortened the traders’ work hours, for the convenience of its members.

Ultimately, however, the District Court did not issue an opinion.  The Justice Department and CBOT entered into a [[consent decree]] under which enjoined them from acting upon the same or from adopting or acting upon any similar rule.

==Judgment==
[[Louis Brandeis|Justice Brandeis]], writing for a unanimous court, first observed that every trade association and board of trade imposes some restraint upon the conduct of its members.  He explained the essence of the Rule of Reason:  "The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition."  Whether or not a rule restrains trade in violation of the Sherman Act thus turns on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.

He then examined the nature, scope, effect, and history of the rule.  He held that the call rule was ultimately procompetitive in purpose and effect.  The scope of the rule was such that it only operated during certain times of day, and affects only small percentage of the grain market.  The rule helped to create public market for grain, and made pricing more transparent.  It decreased the [[market power]] of dominant sellers, and made sure that prices were set by open competitive bidding.  The decree of the District Court was reversed.

{{Politics of China |expanded = Law }}

'''Chinese property law''' has existed in various forms for centuries. After the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] in 1949, most land is owned by collectivities or by the state; the [[Property Law of the People's Republic of China]] passed in 2007 codified property rights.

==History==

===Imperial China===
Use of property are usually divided into [[topsoil]] (田皮) and [[subsoil]] (田骨) rights.&lt;ref name="James451"&gt;See [[China law]] for more information. Also, for a discussion on the rural property law in China, please see {{citation|author=Benjamin W. James|title=Expanding the gap: How the Rural Property System exacerbates China's Urban-rural Gap|url=http://www.velaw.com/uploadedFiles/VEsite/Resources/ExpandingtheGap.pdf|journal=Columbia Journal of Asian Law|year=2007|volume=20:2|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landlords paid taxes to the government in return for land-owning rights (known as subsoil rights), but did not have the right to actively use the land. The landlords in turn collected rent from peasants who used the land for agricultural purposes (topsoil rights). There are still on-going debates as to whether Imperial China had actual private property rights. Some argue that the imperial state had limited control over landed property whereas others have a despotic view of imperial China as an all-controlling state. However, the bottom line was that the entire imperial era was seen as one of stagnation, during which "the system .. remain[ed] basically the same for the whole of imperial history".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Peter C.

In fact, the property rights structure during imperial times was time and space dependent, and was affected by wars, rebellions and natural disaster. During such times, there were frequent shifts in ownership as abandoned land was reclaimed after former owners had fled or died.&lt;ref name="Ho2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Peter|title=Myths of tenure security and titling: Endogenous, institutional change in China's development|journal=Land Use Policy|volume=47|year=2015|page=354|issn=0264-8377|doi=10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1911) some [[Land titling|titling]] of land ownership did take place, albeit not systematically or at a national level, and historical titles have been handed down to the present.&lt;ref name="Ho2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ho|first=Peter|title=Institutions in Transition: Land Ownership, Property Rights, and Social Conflict in China: Land Ownership, Property Rights, and Social Conflict in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-9UqOetXpU8C|accessdate=26 October 2015|date=21 July 2005|publisher=OUP|location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-928069-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67}} Newly accrued land along rivers, creeks and other waters – so-called riparian rights – was clearly designated as state property, and the Qing government repeatedly emphasized this in imperial edicts.&lt;ref name="Ho2005"/&gt;{{ rp|100}}

=== Nationalist China ===
During the rule of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Nationalist government]] (1912–1949), land tenure consisted on the one hand of communal and customary rights vested in landlords and nobles, religious institutions, and village communities, and on the other of statutory land rights grafted on to a German and Japanese civil law tradition.&lt;ref name="Ho2015"/&gt;{{rp|354–355}}&lt;ref name="Ho2005"/&gt; {{rp|17}} Under Nationalist rule, most forest was privately owned. Although the Communist government gradually worked towards the abolition of private ownership after they had gained power, private forest holdings continued to exist until the collectivization of the countryside.&lt;ref name="Ho2005"/&gt;{{rp|60}}

===Communist China===
[[File:HammerSickle Tiananmen.jpg|right|thumb|Communism and largely Socialist underpinnings influenced the development of China's Property Laws and Right relating to it.]]
In the areas controlled by Communist forces traditional land tenure was broken up through Land Reform. In the 1930s Land Reform in the old revolutionary base areas, such as the [[Jiangxi Soviet]] and the [[Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region]], was carried out with the least possible social disruption. Middle and rich peasants were allowed to keep part of their land holdings, whereas expropriated landlords were allocated sufficient land to make a living. Yet, directly after the [[Second World War]], Land Reform took a more radical turn. It was not until a speech by Mao in 1948 that a moderate stance was taken once more.&lt;ref name="Ho2005"/&gt;{{rp|5–6}}

There were several times of changes in ownership and control over land in China. Regarding rural land, these changes began with the establishment of the Higher Agricultural Production Cooperatives in 1956. Thereafter rural private land ownership was effectively abolished through Land Reform, which left land in the hands of the state or the collective.&lt;ref name="Ho2005"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

China’s Land Reform (1950-1952) was one of the largest examples of land expropriation in world history. In the process, between 200–240 million acres of arable land were redistributed to approximately 75 million peasant families.&lt;ref name="Ho2005b"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ho|first=Peter|title=Developmental Dilemmas: Land Reform and Institutional Change in China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bpl8wn784d8C|accessdate=26 October 2015|date=24 May 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-23153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}

Until decollectivization in the mid-1980s, there were only two factors making for change in land policies: the level of collective ownership and the extent of freedom in private land use. The Great Leap Forward (1958–1962) forced the central leadership to decentralize land ownership from the commune to the production team. This was laid down in Party regulations promulgated in 1962 (the Sixty Articles)&lt;ref name="Ho2005"/&gt;{{rp|6}}Freedom in the private use (not ownership) of land shifted various times. Before 1958, when rural China was organized into huge administrative units—the [[people’s commune]]s—farmers were allocated small plots of collective land for their own use (ziliudi). Depending on the region, farming was more or less privatized, with managerial responsibilities vested in the household. Farm households negotiated contracts under which they had to deliver grain quota to the state at low fixed prices. The surplus grain above the quota could be sold freely at private markets. These privileges were rescinded twice (and subsequently reinstalled) during the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] (1966–76).&lt;ref name="Ho2005"/&gt;{{rp|6}}
[[File:DengXiaoping.jpg|right|thumb|A picture of [[Deng Xiaoping]],a Chinese politician, statesman, and diplomat.]]

In the case of urban land, after the nationalization of industries and companies in the early 1950s, it was deemed state-owned, although not legally stipulated for a long period of time. Land owned by the state was seen as "absolute" and therefore, did not warrant a title; a principle adhered to – and enshrined in regulation – until today.&lt;ref name="Ho2015"/&gt;{{rp|335}} However, the notion that urban land is tantamount to state ownership and, therefore, excludes private ownership had been formally disputed by the State Land Administration up to the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="Ho2015"/&gt;{{rp|335}}

===Deng Xiaoping's rule===
In the era of [[Deng Xiaoping]], a fundamental legal source of the regime of property and property rights in the PRC lay in the Constitution of PRC enacted in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Albert H.Y. Chen |chapter=The Law of Property and the evolving system of property rights in China|title=''The Development of the Chinese Legal System – Change and Challenges'|location=London and New York|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2011|pages=81–112|isbn=978-0-203-83775-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1982 constitution]] provided for the "socialist public ownership" of the means of production, which takes two forms- state ownership and collective ownership. In 2004, the fourth amendment to the constitution was made. Article 13 of the constitution provided that: "The lawful private property of citizens shall be inviolable. The country shall protect in accordance with law citizens' private property rights and inheritance rights. The country may, as necessitated by public interest, expropriate or requisition citizens' private property and pay compensation therefor." It can thus be seen that China's property laws have been undergoing developments. The most recent development would be the enactment of the Property Law in March 2007 (after 14 years of debates), which is noted as one of the most important core components of the evolving civil law in the PRC.

==Real property rights==
An investor who wants to invest or develop land or property in China must bear in mind China's property laws, most notably the property law introduced in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which for the first time protects the interest of private investors to the same extent as that of national interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Property Rights China New Property Law |url=http://www.worldlawdirect.com/article/3149/property-rights-china-new-property-law-2007.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===
[[Real property]] rights in China can generally be grouped into three types. The first type is ownership rights. The second type is [[usufruct]]uary rights, and the third is security rights.

===Ownership rights===
Ownership rights are protected under Article 39 of The Property Law of the People’s Republic of China, which gives the owner the right to possess, utilize, dispose of and obtain profits from the real property. However, this right has to comply with laws and social morality. It can harm neither public interests nor the legitimate rights and interests of others.&lt;ref&gt;Article 7 {{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, rural collectives own agricultural land and the state owns urban land. However, Article 70 of The Property Law allows for ownership of exclusive parts within an apartment building, which endorses the individual ownership of apartments.

===Usufructuary rights===
The owner of a usufructuary right has the right to possess, utilize and obtain profits from the real properties owned by others.&lt;ref&gt;Article 117 {{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The obligee may not intervene in the exercise of rights by the owner of the usufructuary right.&lt;ref&gt;Article 120{{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Right to land contractual management====
There are several types of usufructuary rights. These include the right to land contractual management, the right to use of construction land, the right to use of residential housing land and [[easement]].
The right to land contractual management allows a contractor of the right to possess, utilize and obtain profits from agricultural land.&lt;ref&gt;Article 125{{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This right is transferable, but the land use rights based on agricultural household contracts cannot be changed arbitrarily for non-agricultural purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Article 128{{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Right to use of construction land====
[[File:Shanghai Tower construction, April 12, 2011.jpg|right|thumb|The state owns urban land, but the right to use of construction land allows developers to profit from land development.]]

The right to use of construction land is only with regard to State-owned land, and the owner of the right is able to build buildings and their accessory facilities. This is in addition to being able to possess, utilize and obtain profits from the land.&lt;ref&gt;Article 135{{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This right may be established by means of assignment or transfer,&lt;ref&gt;Article 137{{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but transfer is limited.&lt;ref&gt;Article 43{{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership of the buildings will change together with the land.&lt;ref&gt;Article 146{{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a protection of the right, the term of the right shall be automatically renewed upon expiration&lt;ref&gt;Article 149{{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it has to be taken back, compensation shall be given.&lt;ref&gt;Article 148{{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Right to use of residential housing land====
The owner of the right to use of residential housing land can possess and utilize such land as collectively owned, and can build residential houses and their accessory facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Article 152{{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Law of Land Administration and other regulations will apply to the attainment, exercise and assignment of the right to the use of residential land.&lt;ref&gt;Article 153{{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Easement====
The owner of easement has the right to use the real property of others to benefit his own real property. Easement will be governed by the terms of a contract.&lt;ref&gt;Article 156{{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security rights===
Forms of security rights include mortgages, pledges and liens.
Holders of security rights have priority if a debtor defaults on his obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Article 170{{citation|title=The Property Law of the People's Republic of China|url=http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to ensure obligations are met. Security rights do not exist independently, but require a valid principal claim, and lapse when the debt lapses.

==Procedures in engaging in property investments==
[[File:Beijing watchtower.jpg|thumb|Property in Beijing]]

===Buying land===
Foreign investors are not allowed to buy land in China. The land in China belongs to the state and the collectives.

===Obtaining land use rights===
A land user obtains only the land use right, not the land or any resources in or below the land.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter II Article 8 [http://www.mlr.gov.cn/mlrenglish/laws/200710/t20071011_656321.htm Land Administrative Law of the People's Republic of China]&lt;/ref&gt;
A land grant contract shall be entered into between the land user and the land administration department of the people’s government at municipal or county level.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://knol.google.com/k/china-real-estate-law-part-1-land-use-right#F%282E%29_ACQUIRING_LAND_USE_RIGHTS|title=China real estate law: Part 1: Land use right|date=1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land grant contract must be signed. Land use rights can be obtained from the land administration department by agreement, tender or auction.&lt;ref&gt;
Article 13 [http://www.lawinfochina.com/display.aspx?lib=law&amp;id=6353 Urban Real Property Administration Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324055453/http://www.lawinfochina.com/display.aspx?lib=law&amp;id=6353 |date=2012-03-24 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Regardless of the method by which the land use rights is granted, a contract for grant of land use right, or more commonly known as a land grant contract, must be entered into by the land user and the local land administration authority or municipal governments at or above the county level as grantor.&lt;ref&gt;
Articles 11 and 14 [http://www.lawinfochina.com/display.aspx?lib=law&amp;id=6353 Urban Real Property Administration Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324055453/http://www.lawinfochina.com/display.aspx?lib=law&amp;id=6353 |date=2012-03-24 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 12 of the [http://www.law-lib.com/law/law_view.asp?id=6611 Provisional Regulations on Grant and Assignment of Urban State-owned Land Use Right] states the different duration of rights provided for different purposes.

====Registration====
In China, there is no unified official procedure for the rules on the registration of land-use rights and the ownership of property.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation|last1=Rehm|first1=Gebhard M.|last2=Julius|first2=Hinrich|title=The New Chinese Property Rights Law: An Evaluation from a Continental Perspective|journal=Columbia Journal of Asian Law|volume=22|date=Spring 2009|issue=2|pages=192}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
All interests in land must be recorded in the official government register. This register is proof of ownership. However, different interests might be registered under different registries.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.chinalawblog.com/2007/05/chinas_new_property_law_part_i_1.html|last=Harris|first=Dan|title=China's New Property Law, Part II -- General Principles|date=May 16, 2007|accessdate=September 25, 2011|publisher=Harris &amp; Moure, pllc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Property Law only offers a general guideline as to recordation. Peter Ho has described the recordation of Chinese property rights per institution as it exists until 2014. An overview is in the table below.

Article 6 provides for a general registration requirement in the cases of creation, modification, transfer, and elimination of rights to immovables.

Article 10(2)(l) requires a unified registration system for all real property rights, but this unified system is currently only adopted in tier one cities&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Cities in China|url=http://www.starmass.com/china_review/city_overview/china_cities.htm|publisher=Star Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt; like Beijing and Shanghai. The unification of interests in a single registry is still not prevalent in the smaller cities and will take more time before its implementation.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt;

Furthermore, Article 10(1) allows for respective local rules of registration.

===Function of notaries===
China has a system of [[Public Notary Office of People's Republic of China|public notaries]] which are a subordinate agency of the Ministry of Justice of the People's Republic of China. They are responsible for certification of property titles.

==Government powers and procedures to expropriate real property==
The description below applies to the [[Chinese economic reform|post-reform]] legal arrangements and should not be confused with nationalistation of property before 1978.

===Rural property expropriation procedure===
The Chinese authorities are empowered under the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Constitution]] and various statutes&lt;ref&gt;Article 42 of the [http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html Property Law] states that: &lt;br&gt;
"For the purpose of public interest, the collectively-owned land, houses and other real property owned by institutes or individuals may be expropriated in line with the procedure and within the authority provided by laws.

For expropriation of collectively-owned land, such fees shall be paid as compensations for the land expropriated, subsidies for resettlement, compensations for the fixtures and the young crops on land, and the premiums for social security of the farmers whose land is expropriated shall be allocated in full, in order to guarantee their normal lives and safeguard their lawful rights and interests. &lt;br&gt;
Where houses and other real properties of institutes and individuals are expropriated, compensations for demolition and resettlement shall be paid according to law in order to maintain the legal rights and interests of the expropriated; where individual residential house is expropriated, the residential conditions of the expropriated shall be guaranteed.&lt;br&gt;
No institution or individual shall withhold, misappropriate, embezzle or privately divide the compensation for expropriation."

Article 44 of the [http://www.lehmanlaw.com/resource-centre/laws-and-regulations/general/property-rights-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china.html Property Law] states that: &lt;br&gt;
"For the purpose of emergency handling or disaster relief, real or movable properties of institutions or individuals may be expropriated in line with the procedure and within the authority provided by laws. After such use or expropriation, the real or movable properties shall be returned to the owner. Compensation shall be made if the real or movable properties of institutions or individuals were damaged or lost after being expropriated."
&lt;/ref&gt;
to [[eminent domain|expropriate]] land use rights contracted to individuals as well as ownership rights from collectives.. Since all land is owned either collectively or by the state,&lt;ref&gt;
Article 10 2004 [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]].
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[eminent domain|expropriation]] of rural land only requires the withdrawal of land use rights for the reason of "public interest."

The definition of public interest is intentionally vague, and a general list of such interests has been expounded in an attempt to define what it means.&lt;ref name="ChinaDaily2011"&gt;
{{cite news|title=China issues new regulations on house expropriation|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2011-01/22/content_11900647.htm|newspaper=[[China Daily]]|date=22 January 2011|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=John Chung|title=Regulations on Expropriation of Immoveable Property on State-owned land and compensation - Effective January 21, 2011|url=http://chinalegalbrief.com/2011/regulations-on-expropriation-of-immovable-property-on-state-owned-land-and-compensation-effective-january-21-2011/|date=27 January 2011|accessdate=22 September 2011|publisher=China Legal Brief}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These include interests such as [[national security|defence]], transportation infrastructure, [[education]] and [[health]].
[[File:Supreme peoples court china.jpeg|thumb|Recent amendments to the implementing regulations have allowed for greater access to justice]]

Currently, the types of compensation are:
#Compensation for loss of land&lt;ref&gt;set at 6 to 10 times the annual output value&lt;/ref&gt;
#Resettlement subsidy&lt;ref&gt;set at 4 to 6 times the average annual output value&lt;/ref&gt;
#Compensation for structures and standing crops&lt;ref&gt;To be determined by provincial governments&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first two are paid to the collective landowners instead of the farmers. Compensation for non-land rural assets is also highly discretionary.

Once the farmers and collective land owners are notified, the expropriation can commence. Disputes regarding the compensation and resettlement shall not affect the implementation of the expropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Article 25 [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2006-05/08/content_584128.htm Land Administrative Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban property expropriation procedure===
The Land Administrative Law provides five situations under which land use rights may be withdrawn:&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation| last=Regional Technical Assistance (RETA 6091)|title=Capacity Building for Resettlement Risk Management: Compensation and Valuation in Resettlement:Cambodia, People's Republic of China, and India|chapter=Expropriation Laws and Practices: The People's Republic of China (PRC)|year=2007|publisher=Asian Development Board|page=16}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
#Public interests
#Renovation of old towns
#Expiration of land terms without renewal
#Dissolution of holder of allocated land rights
#Termination of use of public infrastructure
The rights holder is entitled to "appropriate compensation" in the first two situations.&lt;ref&gt;Article 58 [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2006-05/08/content_584128.htm Land Administrative Law]&lt;/ref&gt; As the state owns the land, compensation is not made for the loss of the rights holder's land use rights,&lt;ref&gt;China Rule of Law Publishing House, 2004. ''New compilation of Laws on Demolition, Compensation and Resettlement for Houses'' [Xinbian Fangwu Chaiqian Buchang Anzhi Falu Shouce], 129-130.&lt;/ref&gt; 
but for the private property which he had lost. It is made either in cash (based on market prices) and accounts for any moving expenses or resettlement subsidies, or in kind (in the form of a replacement structure).&lt;ref&gt;Article 31 2001 Urban Structure Demolition Regulations&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the current legal framework, land developers no longer have the legal power to expropriate, and are no longer involved in the demolition and relocation procedures. The local government or non-profit organisations are now in charge of land expropriation and compensation.

By minimising the business interests in the expropriation procedure, incidents of forced expropriation might be reduced.&lt;ref name="ChinaDaily2011"/&gt;

If a rights holder wants to protect his property, he can evoke certain procedural safeguards, which include: 
*Application to urban condemnation administration for administrative review if agreement is not reached
*If review is unsatisfactory, a lawsuit may be filed within 3 months

In the event that an agreement cannot be reached between homeowners and the government, the expropriation can only be carried out {{em|after}} [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name="ChinaDaily2011"/&gt;

New regulations effective from January 21, 2011 have provided hope for the future with regards to several controversies surrounding urban property expropriation.

In January 2011,a 54-year-old man was beaten to death for refusing to leave his house that was expropriated for demolition.&lt;ref name="ChinaDaily2011"/&gt;
Following this instance, the employment of violence or coercion, or illegal methods like cutting off the water and power supply, to force homeowners to leave is officially disallowed.

Although these new regulations relate to [[urban area|urban land]], the legal principles established have significant implications for the [[rule of law]] in China. The outlook for China’s Land Administrative law is hopeful as future revisions regarding [[rural area|rural land]] are expected to occur in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Collectively owned properties in rural China===
[[File:Rice field, Hunan.JPG|thumb|In China, most, if not all farms are collectively owned - a tradition and practice dating back since the rise of Maoism, an ideology heavily influenced by Socialism.]]

While having implemented the [[Household-responsibility system|household production responsibility system]], China retains [[Collective farming|collectively-owned farmland]] in the rural areas. This creates a large potential for abuse as the critical decisions regarding the land and its use are made by a small number of village leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Wang Weiguo|title=Property Law and Land Reform in Rural China|location=China| publisher=[[China Law]]|date=August 2007}}.

Peter Ho has demonstrated that one of the unresolved issues is the level of collective ownership. Since decollectivization, collective ownership – previously represented by the lowest collective level (former production team) – has been split up in three: the township, administrative village and natural village. Chinese law does not stipulate whether the former production team is still the legal owner.&lt;ref name="Ho2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Peter|title=Who Owns China's Land?

While the Property Law enacted in 2007 provides some legal leverage to prevent the abuse of power by village councils, it remains to be seen if legal remedies are accessible or are even used by the villagers. Prevailing local culture, the fear of authority and the possibility of violent repercussions hinder a victim's inclination to seek legal recourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chinaview.wordpress.com/2011/03/22/chinese-peasants-petitioners-attacked-and-beaten-by-security-personnel-and-hired-thugs/ Chinese Peasants Petitioners Attacked and Beaten by Security Personnel and Hired Thugs] Rdio Free Asia&lt;/ref&gt; Also, such rules may be disregarded by the committees or councils due to lack of enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Wuquanfa lun (The Law of Property)(rev. edn), chapter 17|location=China|publisher=Zhongguo Zhengfa Daxue Press|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While critics may be skeptical of whether the new enactments clarifying the issue of collective ownership will 
make a difference, such changes are still welcomed as signs of increasing protection for the rural villagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=China's next revolution|url=http://www.economist.com/node/8815075|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=8 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue is the problem of rampant corruption arising from rural land transactions, involving both governmental and non-governmental parties. This leads to over-pricing and also improper use of land that goes unchecked.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Refugee Review Tribunal: Research Response: China|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4b6fe1b00.pdf|author=Refugee Review Tribunal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialist values vs acceptance of free-market economy===
With the passing of the Property Law, a number of local legislators fear 
that "while the new property law would undoubtedly increase protection for home 
owners and prevent land seizures, it would also erode China’s socialist 
principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=China passes new law on property|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6456959.stm|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=16 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insistence on socialist values among some of the Chinese ruling elite raises questions on whether China – an emerging world superpower – intends to open its doors fully to the Western world and ideas of free-market liberalism, or whether it will continue to differentiate itself in such matters.

===Abuse by the government through a catch-all phrase of "Public Interest"===
The Chinese government, while liberalizing its property laws, has still 
preserved its right to reclaim any property from an individual, as long as there 
is a public policy consideration. In 2004, it amended its [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|1982 Constitution]] to 
include that the Government has to pay the person compensation for [[expropriation]] 
(''征收'') or requisition (''征用''). However, the article neither provides, 
either in the constitution or in any subsidiary legislation, for the quantum of 
the payment, nor does it stipulate that the payment must be proportional to the 
size of the land. 
This has led to abuse by government bodies, especially in rural areas. Expropriation of land from farmers is the most frequent cause of complaint among farmers.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation|last=Bezlova|first=Antoaneta|title=China's New Property Law ignores farmers' rights|newspaper=Albion Monitor|date=March 15, 2007|url=http://www.albionmonitor.com/0703a/copyright/chinapropertylaw.html}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in 2011, the Chinese Government released regulations 
clarifying this, which promise to provide more transparency and a fairer 
compensation system.&lt;ref name="ChinaDaily2011"/&gt;

Western critics continue to call for greater transparency {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}, 
but such is a difficult state of affairs to arrive at, given the largely 
entrenched system of state [[bureaucracy]] in China.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The ''droit d'auteur'' (or '''French copyright law''') developed in the 18th century at the same time as [[copyright]] developed in the [[United Kingdom]]. Based on the "[[authors' rights|right of the author]]" (''droit d'auteur'') instead of on "copyright", its philosophy and terminology are different from those used in copyright law in [[common law]] jurisdictions. It has been very influential in the development of copyright laws in other [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, and in the development of international copyright law such as the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]].

French copyright law is defined in the ''Code de la propriété intellectuelle'', which implements [[European copyright law]] (directives). Unless otherwise stated, references to individual articles are to the ''Code de la propriété intellectuelle''. Two distinct sets of rights are defined:.
*Proprietary rights (''droits patrimoniaux'')
*[[Moral rights]] (''droits moraux'')

The controversial [[DADVSI]] act was due to reform French copyright law in spring 2006. This law, voted by the French Parliament on June 30, 2006, implements the 2001 [[EU Copyright Directive]]; however, there existed considerable differences of opinion as to how to implement the directive, in many respects.

On 8 December 2005 the [[Tribunal de grande instance de Paris]] concluded that file sharing through peer-to-peer was not a [[Offence (law)|criminal offense]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20061130074742/http://www.juriscom.net/documents/tgiparis20051208.pdf]. The judgment was based on the right to "private copy" described in the [[:fr:Code de la propriété intellectuelle|Intellectual Property Code]] which includes the use of digital media [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/codes_traduits/cpialtext.htm].

On 7 March 2006, however, the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] passed the [[DADVSI|DADVSI Act]] which implemented—with some modifications—the 2001 [[EU Copyright directive|European Union Copyright directive]]. The DADVSI act makes [[peer-to-peer]] sharing of copyrighted works an offense.  It does, however, allow for sharing of private copies of [[Magnetic tape|tape recording]] and other media.

== History ==
{{further|History of copyright law}}
[[file:Histoire église reims 05868 privilège roi.jpg|thumb|1580, royal printed patent, [[Carnegie Library of Reims]].]]
The concept of "right of the [[author]]", which differs from Anglo-American [[copyright]], finds its roots in the practice of [[printing patent]]s and royal [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s, which first appeared in the 16th century and became common in the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Latournerie&gt;Anne Latournerie, [http://multitudes.samizdat.net/spip.php?article168 Petite histoire des batailles du droit d’auteur], ''[[Multitudes]]'' n°5, May 2001 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The privilege concerned the [[publication]] rights to authors' works, rather than [[authors' rights]] ''per se''. The first privilege granted in France was given by [[Henry II of France|Henri II]] in 1551 to [[Guillaume Morlay]], his lute player.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; Through this system of royal privileges, the King granted [[monopoly|monopolies]] to specific editors, and implemented a [[censorship in France|system of censorship]].&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; Privileges were then very short (3 to 10 years), after which the work entered the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; The [[Moulins ordinance]] of 1566, the first piece of legislation to impose to librarians and editors the request of a printing patent, did not make any mention of authors.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt;

Despite this regime which privileged editors over authors, some of the latter succeeded in obtaining privileges for their works. During the [[Muret Affair]], in 1568, the lawyer Marion pleaded for a complete and unrestricted [[right of property]] of the author on his work, and [[intellectual property]] thus entered the French [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt;

At the same time, the practice of remunerating authors by some percentage became common during the 17th century.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; Playwrights, including [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], started to defend their rights because at that time, once a play was published, any troupe could play it without paying anything to its creator.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; The King thus arbitrated between the rival interests of editors and creators, giving his preference to the former.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt;

In 1761, a court decision granted to [[Jean de La Fontaine]]'s granddaughters the right of ownership of La Fontaine's work, legitimized by the right of [[inheritance]].&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; In 1777, two other court decisions limited the publisher's right, which was restricted to the life-time of the author.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt;

Following the abolition of privileges on the [[night of 4 August 1789]], during the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Convention]] enacted new legislation on the matter.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; A draft law was proposed by the [[Abbé Sieyès]], which, although allegedly inspired by [[Marquis de Condorcet|Condorcet]]'s [[pamphlet]] titled ''Fragments sur la liberté de la presse'' (Fragments on [[liberty of the press]], 1776), aimed at struggling against the spread of licentious ideas by imposing responsibility for their diffusion on authors, publishers and librarians.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; Sieyès and Condorcet also advanced the idea of "limited privilege," against [[Perpetual copyright|perpetual privileges]], thus preparing the inclusion in the public domain of the works of [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Molière]], [[Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]], etc. According to Anne Latournerie, "The first revolutionary attempt to provide to authors a legal recognition of their rights on their texts was therefore not the search of a freedom for authors, but rather the exigency of a responsibility.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt;"

Finally, after a controversy concerning dramatic authors, and their rebellion, led by [[Beaumarchais]], these preliminaries resulted in the July 19, 1793 ''[[André Chénier|Chénier Act]]''. The July 14, 1866 Act extends the rights until fifty years after the death of the author.

Debates continued throughout the 19th century – notably, between [[Lamartine]] and [[Proudhon]] – and the [[inter-war period]]. As early as August 1936 during the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], the Minister of National Education and of the Beaux-Arts [[Jean Zay]] proposed a draft law based on a new philosophy of the author as an "intellectual worker" (''travailleur intellectuel'') rather than as an "owner" (''propriétaire''). Jean Zay placed himself in a moral continuum with [[Alfred de Vigny]], [[Augustin-Charles Renouard]] and Proudhon,&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; defending the "spiritual interest of the collectivity".&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; Article 21 of his draft divided the 50 years post-mortem protection period into two different phases, one of 10 years and the other of 40 years which established a sort of legal licence suppressing the right of exclusivity granted to a specific editor.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; Zay's draft project was particularly opposed by the editor [[Bernard Grasset (publisher)|Bernard Grasset]], who defended the right of the editor as a "creator of value",&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; while many writers, including [[Jules Romains]] and the president of the ''[[Société des Gens de Lettres]]'', [[Jean Vignaud]], supported Zay's draft.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; The draft did not succeed, however, in being voted in before the end of the legislature in 1939.

New discussions were undertaken during the [[Vichy regime]], initiated by a [[corporatist]] body,&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; presided over by three jurists, François Hepp, [[René Dommange]], and Paul Lerebours-Pigeonnières.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; Both Hepp and Dommange had been at the forefront of the battle against Jean Zay's draft law during the Popular Front.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt;

During the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], 13 years of debate culminated in the modernization of the law with the March 11, 1957 Act, which was in the mold of the Vichy proposals&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; – a continuity proudly highlighted by François Hepp.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt; A Commission had been created in August 1944, presided over by the jurist [[Jean Escarra]], who had co-signed in 1937 an essay with François Hepp and Jean Reault, published by Grasset, which harshly criticized Jean Zay's draft project.&lt;ref name=Latournerie/&gt;

In 1997, a court decision outlawed the publication on the Internet of [[Raymond Queneau]]'s ''[[Hundred Thousand Billion Poems]]'', an interactive poem or sort of machine to produce poems.&lt;ref name=Libera&gt;Luce Libera, [http://multitudes.samizdat.net/spip.php?article169 "12 268 millions de poèmes et quelques... De l’immoralité des droits moraux]," ''[[Multitudes]]'' n°5, May 2001 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court decided that the son of Queneau and the [[Gallimard]] editions possessed an exclusive and [[moral rights (copyright law)|moral right]] on this poem, thus outlawing any publication of it on the Internet and possibility for the reader to play Queneau's interactive game of poem construction.&lt;ref name=Libera/&gt;

In June 2006, the controversial [[DADVSI|DADVSI Act]], which implemented (including modifications to), the 2001 [[EU Copyright directive]] was passed by the [[French National Parliament|National Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=La farce du téléchargement, par Michel Alberganti | publisher=''Le Monde'' | date=2006-03-14 | url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-651865,36-750471,0.html|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protected works ==
The criterion for protection of a work under French copyright law is that it be an ''œuvre de l'esprit'', a work of the mind (Art. [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/VisuArticleCode?commun=&amp;code=&amp;h0=CPROINTL.rcv&amp;h1=1&amp;h3=4 L112-1]). Hence there must be a human intellectual contribution to the work. A list of types of work which are protected is given in Art. [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/VisuArticleCode?commun=&amp;code=&amp;h0=CPROINTL.rcv&amp;h1=1&amp;h3=4 L112-2]: this list (taken from the Berne Convention) is not limitative.

The copyright protection of computer programs was, and to some extent still is, the subject of much debate in France. Patent protection was first excluded by ''Loi n°68-1 du 2 janvier 1968 sur les brevets d'invention''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do;?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000317285&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006281073&amp;dateTexte=19680103 "Loi n°68-1 du 2 janvier 1968 sur les brevets d'invention" Legifrance] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defined in copyright by ''Loi n°85-660 du 3 juillet 1985 relative aux droits d'auteur et aux droits des artistes-interprètes, des producteurs de phonogrammes et de vidéogrammes et des entreprises de communication audiovisuelle''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000693451&amp;dateTexte=19850704 "Loi n° 85-660 du 3 juillet 1985 relative aux droits d'auteur et aux droits des artistes-interprètes, des producteurs de phonogrammes et de vidéogrammes et des entreprises de communication audiovisuelle" Legifrance] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal position was resolved by the transposition of May 14, 1991 [[EU Directive]] into French law: computer programs and any associated preparatory works qualify for copyright protection in France as in other European Union jurisdictions. Databases are protected by a related ''[[sui generis]]'' [[Database rights|right]].

The term "author" is used to designate the original creator(s) of any type of protected work, ''e.g.'', the artist, photographer, director, architect, etc. Where the author cannot be identified, ''e.g.'', for anonymous works and collective works, the copyright is exercised by the original publisher.

A [[Collective work (France)|collective work]] is a work created at the initiative of a natural or legal person who edits it, publishes it and discloses it under his direction and name and in which the personal contributions of the various authors who participated in its production are merged in the overall work for which they were conceived, without it being possible to attribute to each author a separate right in the work as created. A collective work is the property, unless proved otherwise, of the natural or legal person under whose name it has been disclosed.  The author's rights, vest in such person." The term of the exclusive right is 70 years from January 1 of the calendar year following that in which the work was published."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref={{harvid|Intellectual Property Code – Legifrance}} |title=Intellectual Property Code|chapter=Literary and Artistic Property|publisher=legifrance
 |url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/content/download/1959/13723/version/3/file/Code_35.pdf|accessdate=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proprietary rights ==
The proprietary rights of the author allow him or her to exploit the work for financial gain. The author has the right to authorize the reproduction of the work (''droit de reproduction'') and to allow its ''public'' performance (''droit de représentation''); he or she may also prevent the reproduction or public performance.

The author may transfer his or her proprietary rights to a third party.

=== Duration of proprietary rights ===
The general rule is that the proprietary rights of the author last for seventy (70) years after his or her death (Art. L123-1), or for one hundred (100) years after the author's death if the author is declared to have died on active service (''[[mort pour la France]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christina|last1=Angelopoulos|title=The Myth of European Term Harmonisation: 27 Public Domains for the 27 Member States|ssrn=2145862|date=13 September 2012|location=Rochester, NY|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Katarzyna|last1=Rybicka|title=The Little Prince: almost in the Public Domain|url=http://www.communia-association.org/2015/01/23/the-little-prince-almost-in-the-public-domain/|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (Art. L123-10). The author is deemed to have died on 31 December of the year of death.

Before February 2007, the periods of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] were not taken into account for the determination of the expiry date of proprietary rights, with peculiar ways of counting these (Arts. L123-8 &amp; L123-9 -&gt; see the French Wikipedia article [[:fr:Prorogations de guerre]]). These exceptions applied to works published before and during the wars, and must be added whatever the date of the author's death. These extensions were removed (for non-musical works) by the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courdecassation.fr/jurisprudence_publications_documentation_2/actualite_jurisprudence_21/premiere_chambre_civile_568/arrets_569/br_arret_9940.html Cour de cassation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They still have to be added to the 70 years delay for musical works, because of a 1985 law.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnDocument?base=LEX&amp;nod=1LX985660 Loi n° 85-660 du 3 juillet 1985], art. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

For collaborative works, the date of death of the last collaborator serves as the reference point for the 70 year ''post mortem auctoris'' period (Art. L123-2). Audiovisual works are treated similarly, although the list of collaborators is defined by the law: scriptwriter, lyricist, composer, director.

Proprietary rights in pseudonymous, anonymous or [[collective work]]s last for seventy (70) years after the date of publication (Art. L123-3).

For phonographic works, the proprietary rights last for 50 years after the date of recording.

In addition, posthumous works are copyrighted 25 years from the year of publication.

=== Copyright management societies ===
As in other countries, there are a number of societies which collectively manage the licensing of different types of work and the collection of royalties on behalf of copyright holders. These societies typically operate as [[Voluntary association|associations]], and are regulated by the ''Code de la propriété intellectuelle'' (Arts. L321-1 to L321-13) and the Ministry of Culture. The most important are:

*Centre Français d'Exploitation du droit de copie (CFC)
*[[Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique|Sacem]]
*[[ADAGP]]
*[[SACD (Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques)|SACD]]

== Moral rights ==
French copyright law treats a protected work as an extension of the personality of the author which is protected by a certain number of moral rights. In general, the author has the right to "the respect of his name, of his status as author, and of his work" (Art. L121-1). The following rights are usually recognised:

* right of publication (''droit de divulgation''): the author is the sole judge as to when the work may be first made available to the public (Art. L121-2).
* right of attribution (''droit de paternité''): the author has the right to insist that his name and his authorship are clearly stated.
* right to the respect of the work's integrity (''droit au respect de l'intégrité de l'oeuvre''): the author can prevent any modification to the work.
* right of withdrawal (''droit de retrait et de repentir''): the author can prevent further reproduction, distribution or representation in return for compensation paid to the distributor of the work for the damage done to him  (Art. L121-4).
* right to protection of honour and reputation (''droit à s'opposer à toute atteinte préjudiciable à l'honneur et à la réputation'').

The moral rights of the author may conflict with the property rights of the owner of the work, for example an architect who tries to prevent modifications to a building he designed. Such conflicts are resolved on a case by case basis, and recent jurisprudence has led to a weakening of certain moral rights (notably the right to the respect of the work).

The moral rights are inalienable, perpetual and inviolable. They pass to the author's heirs or executor on the author's death, but may not be otherwise transferred or sold under any circumstances, by either the author or his legal successors. Any agreement to waive an author's moral rights is null and void, although the author cannot be forced to protect his work: he perpetually retains the rights, but he also always has the option to refrain from exercising them.

=== The public domain under French copyright law ===
A work enters the public domain (''domaine public'') once the proprietary rights over it have expired. It may then be used without charge, so long as the moral rights of the author are respected.&lt;ref&gt;See Droit Moral as [[Sociétié Plon et autres v. Pierre Hugo et autres|defined by the Cour de Cassation of Victor Hugo]]&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the name of the author and the original title of the work must be cited.

== Exceptions ==
Art. L122-5 defines the exceptions to French copyright law, which are relatively restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=BF1AAE00BD1C67AC85C19C6E6C919273.tpdjo15v_3?idArticle=LEGIARTI000020740486&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069414&amp;dateTexte=20101108 |title=Article L122-5 du code de la propriété intellectuelle |editor=[[Legifrance]] |accessdate=November 8, 2010|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a work has been published, the author cannot prevent:
:1. Private family performances.
:2. Copies for the private and personal use of the copier. This provision does not apply to works of art, computer programs (where a single safeguard copy is allowed, Art. L122-6-1-II) and databases.
:3. In cases where the name of the author and the source are clearly indicated,
::a) Analyses and short citations justified by the critical, polemical, scientific or pedagogical nature of the work.
::b) Press reviews.
::c) Diffusion of public speeches as current news.
::d) Reproductions of works of art in catalogues for auctions in France (subject to regulatory restrictions).
:4. Parody, pastiche and caricature, "taking into account the usage of the genre".
:5. Acts necessary to access a database within the limits of the agreed use.

There is no specific provision for government works or laws: the copyright is normally held by the relevant public body.

== Criminal sanctions ==
Contrary to the position in most Common Law jurisdictions, the breach of proprietary rights is a criminal offense in France: ''contrefaçon'' (Arts. L335-2 to L335-4). This attracts a fine of up to 300,000 Euros (approx. US$391,850, or £250,300 as of January 2012) and a term of up to three (3) years imprisonment. These penalties are increased to a fine of up to €500,000 and a term of up to five (5) years imprisonment if the offense is committed in an organised group (''bande organisée''). There is no distinction between the breach of French copyright and the breach of foreign copyright, though the breach must occur in the French territory to be punishable. The import of infringing copies into France, and the distribution of such copies, are punished under the same provisions and are subject to the same penalties.

== Relation to international copyright law ==
Under Art. 55 of the [[French constitution|Constitution of 1958]], a ratified treaty is superior to French domestic law. Hence the [[conflict of laws]] provisions of the Berne Convention will be used in determining the applicability of the French ''Code de la propriété intellectuelle''.

== Difference between copyright and ''droit d'auteur'' ==

The ''droit d'auteur'' or authors' rights, in [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Romania]] or [[Germany]], grant (subject to some exceptions) the benefice of the right to natural persons (the author or his heir(s)) and denies it to legal persons (except for collective works, and for software), whereas "droits voisins" or neighbouring rights, grant rights to the editor or the producer. Both authors' rights and neighbouring rights are copyrights in the sense of English or U.S. law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Related rights]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright requires a material fixation of the work, as for example a [[speech]] or a [[choreography]] work, although it is an intellectual work (an ''œuvre de l'esprit''), they will not be protected if they are not embodied in a material support. Such requirement does not exist under the ''droit d'auteur''. As a consequence, an improvised live performance would still benefit from the protection of "droit d'auteur".

=== Moral rights ===

The classical difference between the two systems is the recognition of moral rights in the ''droit d'auteur'' whereas such rights did not initially exist in copyright. Hence, in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], the author is granted a moral right which sees the expression of the personality of the author in the work. In practice, the author will have a right to disclosure, a paternity right, a guarantee that the integrity of his work and his wishes are respected as well as a right of withdrawal (i.e., an author has the right to request his work to be withdrawn from circulation in exchange for compensation from those persons involved in its distribution who would moreover enjoy the right of priority in the event of the said work being redistributed). This right is attached to the author; it is inalienable and transmissible at the death of the author.

Historically, such rights do not exist in copyright, as it has been for decades an economic model, granting solely proprietary rights to authors. However several countries have harmonized their legislation since the ratification of the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]. However, the  [[United States of America]] still refuse to apply the moral rights recognized by this convention.&lt;ref&gt;Kwall, Roberta Rosenthal. [https://books.google.com/books?id=smES_wO_NscC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=the+soul+of+creativity+kwall&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YW7GYnpF9Q&amp;sig=AE0n0MnGyJmeY8gbK7z1rQcxphQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CMWmTqqrObLE0AHRy_2hDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The Soul of Creativity: Forging a Moral Rights Law for the United States"]. Stanford University Press, 2010, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, In the United States of America, moral rights are explicitly recognized for works of [[visual art]]. Indeed, the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]] of 1990 (VARA) recognizes moral rights but applies it only to works of visual art.&lt;ref&gt;Gassaway, Laura. Copyright and moral rights. (Copyright Corner). "Information Outlook," Vol. 6, No. 12 (December 2002), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Difference between copyright and ''droit d'auteur'' for audiovisual and cinematographic works ===

As regards the management of patrimonial rights, the difference between copyright and ''droit d'auteur'' is not so clear as in both system the producer controls the exploiting of the work. It can be stated that the ''droit d'auteur'' favours the author while copyright favours the right to copy (exploitation right) linked to the work itself.

==== Authorship ====

Under French law, the audiovisual work is considered as a collaborative work, that is, a work that has been created by multiple authors. The authorship is granted to natural persons (co-author) that have created the relevant work: scriptwriter, author of the musical composition etc. (L.113.7).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=36&amp;r=2495#art9762 |title=Article L113.7 du code de la propriété intellectuelle |editor=[[Legifrance]] |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[United States of America]], audiovisual works are considered as "works made for hire" (works produced in relation with a contract for hire or service). The author of a work (either a natural or legal person) is the producer.

==== Term of protection of a work ====

In [[France]], a work is protected until 70 years after the death of the last surviving co-author.

==== Applicable law for scriptwriters and directors ====

French law recognizes two types of droit d'auteur: moral rights and proprietary rights. French law rules the relation between authors and producers; such relations shall be formalized in a contract according to which the author assigns his proprietary rights to the producer.

In the [[United States of America]], labor law rules relations between "creators" and the production companies. Scriptwriters and directors are consequently the employees of the producer. As such, they can be fired and replaced at any moment, and their names will appear in the theme song only if their work fulfills the necessary conditions for the attributions of "credits" as provisioned under the MBA (Minimum Basic Agreement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wga.org/content/default.aspx?id=1610 |title=2011 Writers Guild of America Theatrical and Television Basic Agreement |editor=[[Writers Guild of America]] |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Law does not grant morals rights to the "creators".  Some rights related to moral and proprietary rights are negotiated.

=== Towards harmonization ===

The difference between the two systems tends to disappear. For instance, moral rights are recognized progressively in the [[United States of America]]. Hence eleven [[U.S. states]] recognize explicitly moral right. Moreover, United States of America courts tend to take into account this right. [[California]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] guarantee the integrity of the author's work, and the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]], enacted October 27, 1990, transposes in a [[federal law]] moral rights of artists. In the [[United Kingdom]], moral rights have been incorporated in copyright law ([[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]).

For a historical and comparative overview of [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] law in the United States of America, see Thomas F. Cotter (1997) "Pragmatism, Economics, and the Droit Moral", 76 ''North Carolina Law Review'' 1 .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/integrity/Links/Articles/cotter.html |title=Thomas F. Cotter, Pragmatism, Economics, and the Droit Moral, 76 N.C.L.Rev. 1 (1997) |editor=[[North Carolina Law Review]] |accessdate=December 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current tendency is that the ''droit d'auteur'' tends to guarantee an economic protection while copyright guarantee increasingly moral rights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9188">The '''copyright law of Panama''' is primarily based on 1994 legislation, known as Law 15. The history of Panamanian [[intellectual property]] legislation dates to the 19th century. Only recently has copyright in Panama became seriously enforced, with past international criticism focusing on insufficient effort to enforce intellectual property laws. A new 2012 law has attracted concerns in the opposite direction, with many criticising it for being too draconian.

==History==
Some provisions for copyright in Panama date to 1826, and Panama has been a party to a number of international copyright treaties throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref name=wipoec/&gt; The modern copyright law in Panama is based on a 1994 law.&lt;ref name=wipoec/&gt; The [[Panamanian National Assembly]] in August 1994 passed a comprehensive [[copyright]] bill (Law 15), based on a [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] model.&lt;ref name=wipoec/&gt;&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;  The law modernizes copyright protection in Panama, provides for payment of [[royalties]], facilitates the prosecution of copyright violators, protects computer software, and makes copyright infringement a [[felony]],&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; with a fine up to $20,000, handed by the National Office of Copyright at the [[Panamanian Ministry of Education]].&lt;ref name=wipoec/&gt; The law also recognizes the existence of [[moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]].&lt;ref name=wipoec/&gt; The length of duration of copyright is 50 years after the author's death, or the publication of an anonymous work.&lt;ref name=wipoec/&gt;

The Law 23 of 1996 created the Intellectual Property Interdisciplinary Commission, which oversees many copyright-related cases in Panama.&lt;ref name="wipoec"/&gt;

In September 2012 Panama passed a new copyright law (Bill 510).&lt;ref name=bb/&gt; The bill is a result of negotiations in the [[Panama–United States Trade Promotion Agreement]].&lt;ref name=rt/&gt;&lt;ref name=cj/&gt; The new law gives the Panamanian copyright office (General Department of Copyright, DGDA&lt;ref name=ca/&gt;) the power to fine those found to have violated copyright through [[file-sharing]], and hand out fines of $100,000 ($200,000 on second offense); the offenders have fifteen days to defend themselves before being arrested.&lt;ref name="bb"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eff/&gt; The fines would be kept by the copyright office, which has the right to use them for salary bonuses, with none of them passed to the copyright holders.&lt;ref name=bb/&gt;&lt;ref name=rt/&gt;&lt;ref name="ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name=eff/&gt; The copyright infringers however may still be separately sued by the copyright holder.&lt;ref name=rt/&gt; If found guilty, the copyright infringers also have to pay for a press announcement where they plead guilty of [[Internet piracy]].&lt;ref name=rt/&gt; The 2012 has also limited the applications of [[fair use]] in Panama.&lt;ref name="td2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cdt/&gt;

==Criticisms==
Although the lead prosecutor for [[intellectual property rights]] cases in the Panamanian Attorney General's Office has been involved in a number of prosecutions, the Panamanian Copyright Office has been described by a 2001 US report as "small and ineffective".&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; According to that report, the Panamanian Copyright Office has been slow to draft and move forward further improvements to the Copyright Law to implement the new [[WIPO]] treaties (the [[WIPO Copyright Treaty]] and the [[WIPO Performances and Phonographs Treaty]]).&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Nevertheless, their proposal also would establish new offenses, such as for internet-based copyright violations, raise the penalties for infractions, and enhance border measures.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; The legislation has been moving forward with technical assistance from [[SIECA]] (the Central American Economic Integration System).&lt;ref name="cp"/&gt;

The 2012 law has attracted criticism from [[free culture movement|free culture]] and [[digital rights]] activists (such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]), both in Panama and abroad.&lt;ref name=bb/&gt;&lt;ref name="cj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eff"/&gt;&lt;ref name=td2/&gt;&lt;ref name=cdt/&gt; The bill's poor wording makes it possible that even users of paid-for [[streaming media]] content, such as [[Netflix]] or [[Pandora Radio]] services, could be seen as in violation of it.&lt;ref name=rt/&gt; It has been called "draconian"&lt;ref name="rt"/&gt; and "incredibly unbalanced";&lt;ref name="Panama Passes Incredibly Unbalanced Copyright Bill: Internet and User Rights Threatened"/&gt; [[Andres Guadamuz]] from [[Technollama]],&lt;ref name="Is Panama about to pass the worst copyright law in history?"/&gt; quoted by [[Cory Doctorow]], the EFF and others, has called it "the worst [copyright law] in the history of the universe."&lt;ref name=bb/&gt;&lt;ref name=rt/&gt;&lt;ref name=eff/&gt; EFF noted that the new law violates the principle of [[due process]].&lt;ref name=eff/&gt; The bill has been widely unknown to the Panamian public as of the moment it passed its legislation, and not subject to any significant public debate.&lt;ref name="Panamanian Copyright Bill (no. 510) Approved by Congress"/&gt; The activists have criticized the US government for giving in to the [[entertainment industry]] by putting pressure on Panama and other Latin American countries, forcing them to adopt what they see as less progressive copyright bills, infringing on [[free speech]] in detriment to the public interest.&lt;ref name=cj/&gt;&lt;ref name=eff/&gt;&lt;ref name=td2/&gt;&lt;ref name=cdt/&gt;

The '''Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007''' (c. 19) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that seeks to broaden the law on [[corporate manslaughter]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Act created a new offence respectively named [[Corporate manslaughter in English law|corporate manslaughter]] in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland law|Northern Ireland]], and corporate homicide in [[Scottish law|Scotland]].

The Act received the [[royal assent]] on 26 July 2007 and came into force on 6 April 2008.&lt;ref name="guidance"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 |publisher=Ministry of Justice |url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/manslaughterhomicideact07.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=17 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025031113/http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/manslaughterhomicideact07.pdf |archivedate=25 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{main article|Corporate manslaughter (England and Wales)}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], a [[corporation]] is considered a [[juristic person]] and can be capable of committing, being convicted of and [[sentence (law)|sentence]]d for, a [[criminal offence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Interpretation Act 1978]], s. 5&lt;/ref&gt; However, some conceptual difficulty lies in fixing a corporation with the appropriate ''[[mens rea]]''.&lt;ref name="herring720"&gt;Herring (2004) ''p. ''720&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Act, a corporation could only be convicted of [[manslaughter (England and Wales)|manslaughter]] if a single employee of the company committed all the elements of the offence and was of sufficient seniority to be seen as embodying the "mind" of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;''Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v. Nattrass'' [1972] AC 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Attorney General's Reference (No. 2 of 1999)'' [2000] QB 796, CA&lt;/ref&gt; The practical consequence of this was that such convictions were rare and there was public discontent where it was perceived that culpable corporations had escaped censure and punishment.&lt;ref name="herring720" /&gt;

A '''Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Bill''' was introduced to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] by [[Home Secretary]] [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]] on 20 July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/pabills/200607/corporate_manslaughter_and_corporate_homicide.htm | title=History of passage through Parliament | accessdate=17 October 2007 | year=2007 | publisher=Parliament of the UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Act==
===The offence===
The Act attempts to align the offence of corporate killing north and south of the border. An [[indictable offence]]&lt;ref name="s1(6)"&gt;S. 1(6)&lt;/ref&gt; is committed if the way in which an organisation's activities are managed or organised:&lt;ref&gt;S. 1(1)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Causes a person's [[death]]; and
*Amounts to a gross breach of a relevant duty of care owed by the organisation to the deceased''';

&amp;mdash; and the way in which its activities are managed or organised by its '''senior management''' is a substantial element in the breach.&lt;ref&gt;s 1(3)&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecution in England or Wales requires the permission of the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]], and in Northern Ireland, the [[Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland]]&lt;ref&gt;s 17&lt;/ref&gt; and no [[natural person]] can be charged with [[aiding and abetting]] the offence.&lt;ref&gt;S. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The [[common law]] offence of [[gross negligence]] manslaughter, as it applies to corporations, is abolished.&lt;ref&gt;S. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organisations liable===
The offence applies to:&lt;ref&gt;S. 1(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Corporation]]s;
*[[Partnership]]s,&lt;ref&gt;S. 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[trade union]]s and employers' associations, that are themselves [[labour law|employers]].
*[[Police force]]s;
*Various, but not all, [[government department]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Sch. 1, s. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relevant duty of care===
A '''relevant duty of care''' is one of several [[duty of care|duties of care]] owed by the organisation under the law of [[negligence]] and is a [[question of law]] for the [[judge]].&lt;ref&gt;S. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[government policy]] decisions;&lt;ref&gt;S.3&lt;/ref&gt; [[policing]],&lt;ref&gt;S. 4, s. 13&lt;/ref&gt; [[military]]&lt;ref&gt;S. 5, s. 12&lt;/ref&gt; and [[child protection]]&lt;ref&gt;S. 6&lt;/ref&gt; activities; and emergency responses&lt;ref&gt;S. 7&lt;/ref&gt; are excluded.

There are particular '''duties of care''' owed to persons in [[imprisonment|custody]] (s. 2(1)(d)) and, owing to the sensitivity and difficulty of such duties, implementation of this section was delayed. The [[Ministry of Justice]] published a report on progress towards implementation in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Ministry of Justice | title=Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act: custody provisions | url=http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/announcement210708d.htm | accessdate=22 July 2008 | date=21 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gross breach===
A breach of a duty of care by an organisation is a '''gross breach''' if the alleged conduct amounts to a breach of that duty that falls far below what can reasonably be expected of the organisation in the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;S. 1(4)(b)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[jury (England and Wales)|jury]] must consider whether the evidence shows that the organisation failed to comply with any [[health and safety]] [[legislation]] that relates to the alleged breach, and if so:&lt;ref name="s8"&gt;S. 8&lt;/ref&gt;
*How serious that failure was; and
*How much of a [[risk]] of death it posed.
The jury may also:&lt;ref name="s8"/&gt;
*Consider the extent to which the evidence shows that there were attitudes, policies, systems or accepted practices within the organisation that were likely to have encouraged the failure, or to have produced tolerance of it; and
*Have regard to any health and safety guidance that relates to the alleged breach.

===Senior management===
'''Senior management''' means the persons who play significant roles in:&lt;ref&gt;S. 1(4)(c)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The making of decisions about how the whole or a substantial part of its activities are to be managed or organised; or
*The actual managing or organising of the whole or a substantial part of those activities.

==Penalties==
On conviction a corporation may be ordered to remedy any breach,&lt;ref&gt;S. 9&lt;/ref&gt; or to publicise its failures,&lt;ref&gt;S. 10&lt;/ref&gt; or be given an unlimited [[fine (penalty)|fine]].&lt;ref name="s1(6)" /&gt; The [[Sentencing Guidelines Council]] issued a steps based definitive guideline, effective from 1 February 2016, for sentencing the offence of corporate manslaughter. The recommendations of the guideline are based on the size and turnover of the organisations with a starting fine of £300,000 and a no limit maximum.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/HS-offences-definitive-guideline-FINAL-web.pdf|title=Health and Safety Offences, Corporate Manslaughter and Food Safety and Hygiene Offences Definitive Guideline|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Sentencing Council|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an individual is also found liable for the offence of manslaughter, it can be prosecuted under the [[Health and Safety at Work Act 1974]] ruled by the same sentencing guideline.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''enterprise theory''' of crime understands the organization of [[criminal behaviour]] as reflective of specific environmental factors - market or economic forces, influencing the [[Motivation|motivations]] of criminals, how they interact, their perceptions or risk versus benefit, and the efficiency and efficacy of their [[modus operandi]].

Under this theory, [[Organized crime|organised crime]] exists because legitimate markets leave many customers and potential customers unsatisfied.&lt;ref name="Smith 1978"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith|title=ORGANIZED CRIME AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP|journal=International Journal of Criminology and Penology|year=1978|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=49083}}&lt;/ref&gt;  High demand for a particular good or service (e.g. drugs, prostitution, arms, slaves), low levels of risk detection and high profits lead to a conducive environment for entrepreneurial criminal groups to enter the market and profit by supplying those goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith|title=Paragons, Pariahs, and Pirates: A Spectrum-Based Theory of Enterprise|journal=Crime and Delinquency|year=1980|volume=26|issue=3|url=http://cad.sagepub.com/content/26/3/358.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For success, there must be:
* an identified market; and,
* a certain rate of consumption (demand) to maintain profit and outweigh perceived risks.&lt;ref name="Albanese 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Albanese|title=Risk Assessment in Organized Crime Developing a Market and Product-Based Model to Determine Threat Levels|journal=Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice|year=2008|volume=24|issue=3|url=http://ccj.sagepub.com/content/24/3/263.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Albanese 2000 409–423"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Albanese|first=J|title=The Causes of Organized Crime: Do Criminals Organize Around Opportunities for Crime or Do Criminal Opportunities Create New Offenders?|journal=Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice|year=2000|volume=16|issue=4|pages=409–423|doi=10.1177/1043986200016004004|url=http://ccj.sagepub.com/content/16/4/409.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under these conditions competition is discouraged, ensuring criminal [[monopolies]] sustain profits. Legal substitution of goods or services may (by increasing competition) force the dynamic of organised criminal operations to adjust, as will deterrence measures (reducing demand), and the restriction of resources (controlling the ability to supply or produce to supply).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith|title=Wickersham to Sutherland to Katzenbach: Evolving an "official" definition for organized crime|journal=Crime, Law, and Social Change|year=1991|volume=16|issue=2|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/vx65474157u47816/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  '''''Fordham International Law Journal''''' is a student-run [[law review|law journal]] associated with the [[Fordham University School of Law]]. According to the Washington and Lee journal rankings, it is the 4th most cited student-edited international and comparative law journal in the United States.&lt;ref name=Library&gt;{{cite web | title = Law journals: submissions and ranking, 2007-2014 | url = http://lawlib.wlu.edu/lj/index.aspx | publisher = Law Library, [[Washington and Lee University]] | access-date = 10 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current editor-in-chief is Shade Quailey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Masthead | url = https://news.law.fordham.edu/filj/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/07/Volume-XLII-Masthead-Staff.pdf | publisher = [[Fordham University School of Law]] | access-date = 10 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Fordham International Law Journal ("the ILJ" or "ILJ") was established in 1977 at the Fordham University School of Law.&lt;ref name=Founded&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sweeney | first = Joseph C. | title = Introduction | journal = Fordham International Law Journal, special issue: Twenty-Five Years of the Fordham International Law Journal | volume = 25 | pages = 541-562 | publisher = [[Fordham University School of Law]] | date = 2002 | url = http://law.fordham.edu/assets/ILJ/25FordhamIntlLJ541%282001-2002%29.pdf | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded at that time as the Fordham International Law Forum.&lt;ref name=Founded /&gt; The ILJ attracts contributions from prominent statespersons and members of the academic, legal, and political communities. ILJ pieces have been cited in numerous [[US federal court]] decisions, [[US Supreme Court]] briefs and decisions,&lt;ref&gt;Verizon Commc’n, Inc. v. Federal Commc’n Comm’n, 535 U.S. 467, 549 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; international courts decisions, law review articles, and [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] and [[American Law Reports|ALR]] annotations.&lt;ref name=Library /&gt;

The ILJ publishes five books annually covering diverse foreign and international legal topics and containing scholarly articles, essays, book reviews, and student pieces. The ILJ also publishes an annual [[Crowley Report]] in association with Fordham’s [[Leitner Center for International Law and Justice]].&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web | title = About | url = http://law.fordham.edu/fordham-international-law-journal/5489.htm | publisher = [[Fordham University School of Law]] | access-date = 10 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.leitnercenter.org/ | website = leitnercenter.org | publisher = Leitner Center for International Law and Justice | access-date = 10 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ILJ assists in the organization and production of the Fordham Corporate Law Institute's Conference on International Antitrust Law and Policy, the Leitner/Stein Colloquium, and the [[New York City Bar Association]]'s reception for the legal advisers of the foreign ministries of the United Nations. The ILJ maintains an especially strong relationship with officials from the [[European Union]] and one book in each volume is devoted to [[EU law]]. Past volumes have included contributions from judges on the [[European Court of Justice]], commissioners of the [[European Commission]], and other senior EU officials.&lt;ref name=About /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1419">In modern U.S. usage, '''forfeiture''' is deprivation or destruction of a [[rights|right]] in consequence of the non-performance of some [[Obligation (law)|obligation]] or condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Connellan v. Federal Life &amp; Casualty Co.|vol=134|reporter=ME|opinion=104|date=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be accidental, and therefore is distinguished from [[waiver]]; ''see [[waiver and forfeiture]].''  

Historically, forfeiture of a convict’s land and other assets followed on from conviction for certain serious offences (and thus resulted from criminal activity rather than from a failure to act).  A striking illustration of the practical effects of this rule is [[Giles Corey]]’s refusal to plead, in the [[Salem Witch Trials]], instead dying under ''[[peine forte et dure]]''.  By refusing to plead he avoided the jurisdiction of the court and thus avoided conviction and the consequent forfeiture of his estate.  Instead it passed to his sons.{{citation needed |date=November 2018}}

In the early 21st century, the [[United States Government]] began to seize [[domain name]]s, on the legal theory that they were property used in [[criminal activity|criminal activities]] and thus subject to forfeiture.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8178">The '''Goldman child abduction case''' refers to the [[international child abduction]] of Sean Goldman and the international petition for his repatriation by his father, David Goldman, over the objections of the family of his mother, Bruna Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro, and her [[widow]]er, João Paulo Lins e Silva.

==The child abduction case==
The child abduction case evolved around application of [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]]. Sean Richard Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro Goldman&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geneall.net/U/per_page.php?id=1213430 GeneAll]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Revista/Epoca/0,,EMI63217-15227,00-COMO+VIVE+SEAN+GOLDMAN.html Época magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; was born in the year 2000 in the [[United States]], to an American father and Brazilian mother. In 2004, at the age of four years, Sean went to [[Brazil]] with his mother for a 2-week vacation. However, his mother refused to return to the United States. The father David Goldman vowed to have his son back and lawsuits and counter-lawsuits ensued both in the United States and in Brazil.

Bruna Bianchi eventually filed for, and was granted, a [[divorce]] by a Brazilian court. She then married Brazilian lawyer João Paulo Lins e Silva in 2007, and subsequently died while giving birth to their child in 2008. After Bruna's death, the Brazilian husband obtained a custody order for the child from the Brazilian courts by failing to inform them of Bruna's death and requesting a new Brazilian birth certificate be issued that listed himself as the father under the Brazilian concept of socio-affective paternity, on the basis of which, he refused to return the boy to David Goldman, Sean's father. Based on a decision of [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Brazil's Supreme Court]], Sean was handed over to his father on December 24, 2009. As of January, 2010, his Brazilian family was hoping to regain custody.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldmeets.us/folha000026.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Sean's grandmother Silvana Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro has vowed to continue the battle through the Brazilian courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/goldman-custody-battle-grandmother-vows-fight-boy/story?id=9447000 Goldman Custody Battle: Grandmother Vows to Continue Battle in Brazilian Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International ramifications==
The case was focus of international media coverage. It was also subject of deliberations during meetings of high level [[Brazil]]ian and [[United States|American]] officials. US Congress introduced H.R. 2702, legislation to suspend Brazil's [[Generalized System of Preferences]] trading benefit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-2702&amp;tab=summary H.R. 2702: To suspend the application of Generalized System of Preferences for Brazil until such time as... ]&lt;/ref&gt; The case was also discussed on the US House of Representatives floor with a statement from Congressman [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] (Republican, New Jersey), a staunch supporter of David Goldman, a New Jersey resident;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.xpd?id=111-h20090603-55 Rep Chris Smith: On Sean Goldman - Justice Delayed Again]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] treated the case as a diplomatic issue of Brazil's obligations under the Hague Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/12/134047.htm ''Return of Sean Goldman''] (Statement of Secretary of State Clinton, 2009-12-24)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
*On 30 January 2009, [[NBC]]'s news program ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' broadcast a lengthy piece titled "Fighting for Sean"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28878143/ns/dateline_nbc-crime_reports/ Meredith Vieira: Transcript of ''Dateline NBC'' program "Bring Sean Home"]&lt;/ref&gt; on the case and an interview by program's [[Meredith Vieira]] with David Goldman, the child's father.
*The ''Dateline'' piece caught the attention of Congressman Chris Smith (R-New Jersey) who contacted the father and offered help. He wrote a major article in ''[[The Washington Times]]'' on 19 June 2009 titled "Will Brazil Do The Right Thing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/19/will-brazil-do-the-right-thing//print/ Rep. Christopher H. Smith in ''The Washington Times'': Will Brazil Do The Right Thing]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Goldman was interviewed on many media outlets including in ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' a few times, on [[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr Phil]] show on 1 December 2008, on [[CNN]]'s [[Larry King Live]] on 4 March 2009, on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]]'s ''[[Canada AM]]'' and on [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''On the Record''
*There were public comments on the case by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on 4 March 2009 on NBC's ''Today'' show and by Brazilian President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula]] on CNN on 23 March 2009.    
*On 15 July 2009, David Goldman testified in front of a Congress committee about child abductions. On 16 July 2009, NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' broadcast a one-hour interview with him.
*NBC paid for a [[Charter airline|charter flight]] for David Goldman and 9-year-old Sean back to the U.S. ''NBC News''' [[Jeff Rossen]] was on board the plane. The [[Society of Professional Journalists]] condemned [[NBC News]] for practicing "checkbook journalism" by chartering a jet that carried David and Sean Goldman home from Brazil. However Mr. Goldman stated in his book [[A Fathers Love]] that [NBC] had chartered the jet to fly its crew home in time for Christmas and that they offered them a ride so that he wouldn't have to risk taking a public flight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/29/society-of-professional-j_n_406692.html ''Huffington Post'': Society Of Professional Journalists Slams NBC For Practicing 'Checkbook Journalism']&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 8 January 2010, ''Dateline NBC'' broadcast a special on the case upon the successful return of the child to his father. The 2-hour special presented by Meredith Vieira was titled "Bringing Sean Home: The Untold Story". Parts of the exclusive interview and shots of the father-son reunion were broadcast on NBC's ''Today'' on 28 December 2009. Parts of this special were aired in [[Brazil]] by [[Rede Record]] newsmagazine ''[[Domingo Espetacular]]'' presented by [[Paulo Henrique Amorim]], on 17 January 2010.
* The season 20 episode of [[Law &amp; Order]] titled [[Brazil (Law &amp; Order)|Brazil]] was inspired by the custody case.
* On April 27, 2012 Dateline aired an exclusive interview with Sean Goldman that was conducted by Meredith Vieira.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Greece]] on 15 November 1968.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p830 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters were asked whether they wished to ratify a [[Greek Constitution of 1968|new constitution]] prepared by the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|dictatorial regime]]. It was approved by 92.1% of voters, with a voter turnout of 77.7%.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p838&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
A military junta, presided over by Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos]], had ruled Greece since a group of middle-ranking officers [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|staged a coup on 21 April 1967]]. [[Constantine II of Greece|King Constantine II]] reluctantly endorsed the coup, but started preparing for a [[counter-coup]] by elements of the armed forces loyal to him. The counter-coup, launched on 13 December 1967, failed, and the King and the royal family fled to [[Italy]]. In the aftermath of the royal coup attempt, the King was replaced by a [[regent]], General [[Georgios Zoitakis]], and Papadopoulos assumed the post of [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]].

On 16 December, Papadopoulos announced that the new constitution, which had been prepared by a committee of legal experts under [[Charilaos Mitrelias]], President of the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]], was to be formally presented to the people on 16 March 1968, and subsequently confirmed by a plebiscite in summer. The original draft of the Mitrelias Committee, however, was deemed too liberal, and was heavily amended in the following months. In its final form, as presented on 11 July 1968, it retained the [[Greek monarchy|monarchy]], but granted the armed forces autonomy from governmental and parliamentary control and entrusted them with the role of guardians of the ''status quo'', it imposed restrictions on political parties and established a constitutional watchdog, the Constitutional Court, with wide-ranging powers, to regulate the country's political life.

The referendum itself was proclaimed for 29 September, and was regarded by the regime as a public vote of support on its policies. Participation was made obligatory and abstention punishable by imprisonment. The regime employed extensive propaganda in favour of a "yes" vote, while any opposition was silenced. The referendum's results were thus predictably in favour of the new constitution. The vote, despite obligatory participation, was still marked by a high abstention, which reached over 22%.

'''Hanwha Total Petrochemicals Co., Ltd.''', ([[Hangul]]: 한화토탈) is a [[joint venture]] between [[Hanwha]] General Chemicals and [[Total S.A.]]&lt;ref name="hoovers.com"&gt;http://www.hoovers.com/Samsung-Total-Petrochemicals-Co.,-Ltd./--ID__140139--/free-co-factsheet.xhtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="samsungtotal.com"&gt;http://www.samsungtotal.com/EN/Info/company/company.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Both companies own a 50% partnership in the venture.

Founded in 2003 as a joint venture between Samsung General Chemicals and Total (as Samsung Atofina; changed name to Samsung Total in 2004), it was sold to Hanwha in 2015.

The company manufactures building block chemicals that go into the making of a host of other chemicals needed to make various [[Product (business)|consumer products]]. It starts with a naphtha cracker, yielding [[propylene]] and [[ethylene]], which are the raw materials in the production of all manner of [[polymer]]s. Hanwha Total divides its operations in three: polymer production ([[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], high- and [[Low density polyethylene|low-density polyethylene]]), base chemicals (selling the ethylene and propylene the company doesn't use itself, as well as aromatics used to make the materials that go into [[synthetic fiber]]s), and oil products (jet, diesel, gasoline,...)&lt;ref name="hoovers.com"/&gt;

Hanwha Total Petrochemicals is headquartered in [[Seoul|Seoul, South Korea]], but operates a large [[petrochemical]] complex, consisting of 13 separate plants, at Daesan, in Korea’s [[Chungcheongnam-do|Chungnam Province]].&lt;ref name="samsungtotal.com"/&gt; The partnership employs 1100 people.

Hanwha Total's headquarters are located at Daesan, the [[South Chungcheong Province]] in [[South Korea]].
And in addition, PP, PE compounding plant was at Dongkwan in [[China]]. Sales offices are operated in [[Seoul]], [[Busan]], [[Daegu]], [[Gwangju]] and [[Daejeon]]. In [[Asia]], Hanwha Total's sales offices are located in [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Tokyo]], and [[Nagoya]].

'''Initial Interest Confusion''' is a legal doctrine under [[trademark]] law that permits a finding of infringement when there is temporary confusion that is dispelled before the purchase is made. Generally, [[trademark infringement]] is based on the likelihood of confusion for a consumer in the marketplace. This likelihood is typically determined using a multi-factor test that includes factors like the strength of the mark and evidence of any actual confusion. However, trademark infringement that relies on Initial Interest Confusion does not require a likelihood of confusion at the time of sale; the mark must only capture the consumer's initial attention.

A famous hypothetical example of Initial Interest Confusion, first discussed in ''[[Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp.|Brookfield v West Coast Entertainment]]'',&lt;ref name="brookfield"&gt;''Brookfield Communications Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corporation'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/174/174.F3d.1036.98-56918.html 174 F.3d 1036] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929122240/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/174/174.F3d.1036.98-56918.html |date=2009-09-29 }} (9th Cir. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; involves two video stores. West Coast Video's competitor, Blockbuster Video, puts a billboard on a stretch of highway advertising a West Coast Video at an upcoming exit. In reality, there is no West Coast Video at this exit; it is a Blockbuster Video instead. The consumer, expecting to find a West Coast Video store, sees the Blockbuster Video and decides to patronize the suitable replacement. Even though the confusion has been dispelled, Blockbuster is still misappropriating the acquired goodwill of West Coast Video's trademark.

==History==
The Initial Interest Confusion doctrine has been applied by U.S. courts as early as 1975. However, with the appearance of the World Wide Web, Initial Interest Confusion claims have increased from 10 cases relying on the doctrine before 1990 to more than 100 between 1990 and 2005.&lt;ref name="jenniferrothman"&gt;Rothman, Jennifer E., ''[http://ssrn.com/abstract=691543 Initial Interest Confusion: Standing at the Crossroads of Trademark Law]'', 27 Cardozo Law Review 105 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin===

====''Grotrian v Steinway &amp; Sons''====
The first judgment discussing Initial Interest Confusion can be found in ''Grotrian, Helfferich, Schults., Th. Steinweg Nachf. v Steinway &amp; Sons'',&lt;ref name=grotrian&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit.|title=523 F.2d 1331: Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th. Steinweg Nachf., Plaintiff-appellant, v. Steinway &amp; Sons, Defendant-appellee|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/523/1331/384374/|publisher=Justia US Law|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}(2d Cir. 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; although the exact expression is never used. At the time of the dispute, Grotrian, Helfferich, Schultz., Th. Steinweg Nachf. (also referred to as "Grotrian") was importing into the United States pianos labeled "[[Grotrian-Steinweg]]" and advertised under the mark "Steinweg". Consequently, [[Steinway &amp; Sons]] filled a trademark infringement suite against Grotrian. The  parties are historically linked{{spaced ndash}}the founder of [[Steinway &amp; Sons]], [[Henry E. Steinway]] was initially making pianos labeled Steinweg in Germany, and his son partnered with Grotrian. When he immigrated to New York, the business was sold to the three employees Grotrian, Helfferich and Schulz, with the permission to use the "Steinweg" mark.

On appeal, 2nd Circuit Judge [[William Homer Timbers|W. H. Timbers]] confirmed the opinion of Judge [[Lloyd F. MacMahon|L. F. MacMahon]] that "misled into an initial interest, a potential Steinway buyer may satisfy himself that the less expensive Grotrian-Steinweg is at least as good, if not better, than a Steinway."&lt;ref&gt;''Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th. Steinweg Nachf. v. Steinway &amp; Sons'', 365 F. Supp. 707, 717 (S.D.N.Y. 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; The Appellate Court however recognized the likelihood of confusion may not exist at the time of purchase because piano purchasers are considered to be careful enough buyers. Instead, the Court held that actual or potential confusion at the time of purchase did not need to be demonstrated in this case. The motivation behind this decision was that "the Grotrian-Steinweg name would attract potential customers based on the reputation built up by Steinway in [the United States] for many years".  The Court concluded that Grotrian was attempting to increase their sales based on the strength of the name of "Steinway" and that "such ''initial confusion'' works an injury to Steinway".

====''Mobil Oil Corp. v Pegasus Petroleum Corp.''====
The next significant decision&lt;ref name="jenniferrothman"/&gt; relying on Initial Interest Confusion was ''Mobil Oil Corp. v Pegasus Petroleum Corp.''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mobil Oil Corp. v Pegasus Petroleum Corp.'', [http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/548385 818 F.2d 254] (2d Cir. 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, [[Mobil]] sued Pegasus Petroleum, an oil trading company founded in 1981, on the basis of a trademark infringement concerning the "Pegasus" name. Mobil is the holder of a registered trademark in both the flying horse symbol representing the Greek mythological figure of [[Pegasus]], and the name "Pegasus" itself.&lt;ref name="jenniferrothman"/&gt; However, the logo of Pegasus Petroleum did not represent any sort of flying horse and solely consisted of two interlocking letters "P".

At the first trial, Judge [[Lloyd F. MacMahon|L. F. MacMahon]] concluded that "there is a sufficient likelihood of confusion between Mobil's flying horse symbol and Pegasus Petroleum's use of the 'Pegasus' mark to grant Mobil relief under the Lanham Act." While finding the decision "not clearly erroneous", the 2nd Circuit Court clarified on Appeal that the likelihood of confusion had to be understood as a "likelihood that Pegasus Petroleum would gain crucial credibility during the initial phases of a deal". The Court concluded that Pegasus Petroleum was misleading potential customers because of their initial interest suggested by the Pegasus mark and holds that this initial confusion alone constitutes a sufficient trademark injury.

===The Internet Era===
Initial Interest Confusion has become much more visible in the Internet age.&lt;ref name="jenniferrothman"/&gt; Courts have upheld trademark infringement claims in domain names ([[cybersquatting]]), [[Meta element|meta-tags]] that influence search engine results, and advertising keywords using the Initial Interest Confusion doctrine.

====''Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp.''====
{{Main|Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp.}}
In ''Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. West Coast Entertainment Corp.'',&lt;ref name="brookfield"/&gt; the 9th Circuit embraces the Initial Interest Confusion doctrine which has previously been developed in the 2nd Circuit, and directly addresses the question whether registered trademark terms can be used as [[Meta element|meta tags]] on web pages of non-trademark holders.

Brookfield developed a software, named MovieBuff, which consisted of a searchable database of past, current and upcoming films, their box office reviews, schedules, and other data. A federal trademark registration for "MovieBuff" was issued in 1998, covering both goods and services. In order to sell the MovieBuff software, Brookfield registered two [[domain name]]s: ''moviebuffonline.com'' and ''brookfieldcomm.com'' in 1996. He also placed a version of the database online at ''inhollywood.com''. Brookfield was not able to register the domain ''moviebuff.com'' at the time because West Coast has previously registered it.

West Coast, one of the nation's largest video rental store chains, subsequently launched on ''moviebuff.com'' an online movie database service similar to the one Brookfield had deployed. Furthermore, both this web site and ''westcoastvideo.com'', the legitimate domain of West Coast,  contained the meta keywords "moviebuff" and "moviebuff.com". These meta keywords were intended to be indexed by [[search engine]]s, so that a consumer searching for "moviebuff" could find the page. While this was a common way to increase visibility in earlier search engines, most modern search engines do not rely on meta keywords for ranking results.

Although the 9th Circuit admitted that there was no likelihood of confusion between the two products, the Court nonetheless held West Coast liable for trademark infringement because the "moviebuff" trademark, as well as "moviebuff.com", appeared in the metatags of ''westcoastvideo.com'', the non-infringing domain used by West Coast. The Court states "although there is no source confusion in the sense that consumers know they  are patronizing West Coast rather than Brookfield, there is nevertheless initial interest confusion in the sense that, by using ''moviebuff.com'' or ''MovieBuff'' to divert people looking for ''MovieBuff'' to its web site, West Coast improperly benefits from the goodwill that Brookfield developed in its trademark."

====''Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp.''====
{{Main|Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp.}}
In ''Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp.'',&lt;ref name="playboy"&gt;''Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp.'', [http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/354/354.F3d.1020.00-56662.00-56648.html 354 F.3d 1020] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517185319/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/354/354.F3d.1020.00-56662.00-56648.html |date=2010-05-17 }} (9th Cir. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Playboy charged Netscape (along with Excite) for selling banner ads keyed on trademarked terms "playboy" and "playmate". A district court dismissed the case, citing fair use and other arguments. However, the Ninth Circuit drew comparisons to ''Brookfield v West Coast'',&lt;ref name="brookfield"/&gt; and came to the conclusion that "analogies to Brookfield suggest that PEI will be able to show a likelihood of confusion sufficient to defeat summary judgment. The Court held that Playboy was likely to show that consumers may be attracted to competitors' products by free riding Playboy's reputation when using the trademarks "playboy" and "playmate", even if the consumers are well aware that they are not buying services from Playboy.

==Controversy==
Several people have criticized the doctrine of Initial Interest Confusion. One concern is that Initial Interest Confusion "lacks a rigorous definition".&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;Goldman, Eric, ''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=635803 Deregulating Relevancy in Internet Trademark Law]'', 54 Emory Law Journal 559 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have said that, absent a coherent conception of damage to the trademark holder, initial interest confusion makes actionable not "actual damage incurred by the trademark holder" but something more like "brand indignation." &lt;ref name="coleman"&gt;Coleman, Ronald, ''[http://www.likelihoodofconfusion.com/?page_id=1543 De Minimis Confusion on the Internet: Compounding the Error of Initial Interest]'', 3 Journal of Internet Law (October 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;   Additionally, some state that because Initial Interest Confusion can be found without the multi-factor analysis of likelihood of confusion, it represents "a short-cut to infringement, like a judicial game of 'Chutes and Ladders'" &lt;ref name="pink"&gt;Pink, Jonathan, ''[http://www.ipfrontline.com/depts/article.asp?id=4697&amp;deptid=4 Initial Interest Confusion Doctrine]'', IP Frontline (Jul. 6, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  Another concern is the lack of consensus among courts about the applicability of Initial Interest Confusion.&lt;ref name="kravitz"&gt;Kravitz, Jason C., ''[http://www.nixonpeabody.com/publications_detail3.asp?ID=729 Initial Interest Confusion: Dispelling Some of the Confusion]'', Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly (Aug. 23, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marsha S. Berzon|Judge Berzon]] of the Ninth Circuit, in a concurring opinion in ''Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp.'', asked whether the court wanted to "to continue to apply an insupportable rule", referring to Initial Interest Confusion as discussed in ''Brookfield''.&lt;ref name="playboy" /&gt;

==Notable cases==
*''[[Google, Inc. v. American Blind &amp; Wallpaper Factory, Inc.]]'', in which the legality of Google's AdWord program was challenged on the basis of initial interest confusion.
*''[[Lamparello v. Falwell]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3421">The '''International Fuel Tax Agreement''' (or '''IFTA''') is an agreement between the [[Continental United States|lower 48 states]] of the [[United States]] and the [[Canadian provinces]], to simplify the reporting of fuel use by motor carriers that operate in more than one jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Finance, Ontario. Canada. [http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/tax/ifta/ International Fuel Tax Agreement]. Retrieved on 26-08-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Alaska, Hawaii, and the [[Canadian territories]] are not required to participate, however all of Canada and Alaska do.  An operating carrier with IFTA receives an IFTA license and two decals for each qualifying vehicle it operates. The carrier files a quarterly [[fuel tax]] report.  This report is used to determine the net tax or refund due and to redistribute taxes from collecting states to states that it is due.

This tax is required for motor vehicles used, designed, or maintained for transportation of persons or property and:
*The Power Unit has two axles and a [[gross vehicle weight]] or registered gross vehicle weight in excess of 26,000 pounds, and/or
*The Power Unit has three or more axles regardless of weight, and/or
*Is used in combination, when the weight of such combination exceeds 26,000 pounds gross vehicle or registered gross vehicle weight.&lt;ref name=Manual2010&gt;http://www.iftach.org/manuals/2010/AA/Articles%20of%20Agreement%20FINAL%20-%20January%202010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions exist for [[recreational vehicles]] such as motor homes, pickup trucks with attached campers, and buses when used exclusively for personal pleasure by an individual.&lt;ref name=Manual2010/&gt; Some states have their own exemptions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iftach.org/exempt/view/general.php&lt;/ref&gt; that often apply to farm vehicles or government vehicles.

== Promulgation ==
Prior to IFTA each state had its own fuel tax system and a truck needed tax permits for each state in which it operated. Most states established Ports of Entry to issue permits and enforce tax collection, which was burdensome to the trucking industry and the states. Pre-IFTA trucks in interstate commerce carried special plates ("Bingo Plates") upon which each state's permit sticker was affixed. This was inefficient and proved to be costly for each state to manage.

== How it works ==
Simply stated, IFTA works as a "pay now or pay later" system. As commercial motor vehicles buy fuel, any fuel taxes paid are credited to that licensee's account. At the end of the fiscal quarter, the licensee completes their fuel tax report, listing all miles traveled in all participating jurisdictions and lists all gallons purchased. Then the average fuel mileage is applied to the miles traveled to determine the tax liability to each jurisdiction. Three states—Kentucky, New Mexico, and New York—have "weight-mile" taxes in addition to the standard fuel tax. Oregon has just a weight-mile tax. Any amount of fuel taxes due (or refund) is then paid to (or received from) the base jurisdiction who issued the license. The member jurisdictions then take care of transferring the funds accordingly. Audits are conducted only by the base state and fuel bonds are rarely required.

{{Tort law}}

In the [[law]] of [[tort]]s, an '''invitee''' is a person who is invited to land by the possessor of the land as a member of the public or one who enters the land of another for the purpose of business dealings with the possessor of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Premises Liability Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/premises_liability/premises_liability.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of a visitor as an invitee (as opposed to a [[trespasser]] or a [[licensee]]) defines the legal rights of the visitor if they are injured due to the [[negligence]] of the property owner.

There are generally two types of invitees i.e. Business Invitee and Public Invitee.
* Business Invitee is a person who enters business property to do business with the land occupier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Invitee|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/business_invitee|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Public Invitee is a person who enters land in the possession of another for the purpose for which the property is held open to the public, even if no business purpose is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=19 [[Restatement of Torts, Second]], Sec. 31|date=2002|publisher=American Law Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if "invited" onto somebody's premises, a social guest is classified as a licensee.

The property owner has a duty to make the property safe for the invitee, which includes conducting a reasonable inspection of the premises to uncover hidden dangers. The property owner also has a [[duty to warn]] the invitee of hazardous conditions that cannot be fixed. Furthermore, property owners assume a [[duty to rescue]] an invitee who falls into peril while visiting the property. If an [[independent contractor]] hired by the landowner injures an invitee (intentionally or through negligence), the owner can be held [[vicariously liable]]. This represents the broadest [[duty of care]] owed to any class of visitors to the property.

An invitee is only an invitee within the scope of permission granted by the landowner.  Thus, if an invitee is invited to do business in a store and is injured snooping around in the private storage area, he does not have invitee status in that area.  So if the invitee is snooping around in the dark, trips and falls on something, the land occupier is not liable since the snooper exceeded the consent given him/her (''Whelan v. Van Natta'').

In California, the case of ''[[Rowland v. Christian]]'' sought to eliminate the distinction between business invitee and licensee in regard to a land occupier owing a duty to act as a "reasonable man" in rendering the property safe for others.

Amid the chaos and confusion there was a bizarre scene playing out in the jail. The entire prison had been emptied, except for five men who had chosen to stay there because they had nowhere else to go. There was a man from Manchester called Jamal Udeen, two Saudis, a student from Tartarstan - and Mr al-Ginco. They became known as the "Kandahar Five".

'''''Leser v. Garnett''''', 258 U.S. 130 (1922),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Leser v. Garnett|volume=258|page=130|pin=|year=1922}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] had been constitutionally established.

==Prior history==
On August 26, 1920, the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was certified by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Bainbridge Colby]].  The amendment reads as follows:
{{quote|The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.

Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.}}

==Case==
The Supreme Court granted [[certiorari]] to decide "Whether the Nineteenth Amendment has become part of the federal Constitution."  The plaintiffs disputed the constitutionality of the amendment through three claims:

* The power to amend the Constitution did not cover this amendment, due to its character.
* Several states that had ratified the amendment had constitutions that prohibited women from voting, rendering them unable to ratify an amendment to the contrary.
* The ratifications of [[Tennessee]] and [[West Virginia]] were invalid, because they were adopted without following the rules of legislative procedure in place in those states.

In a unanimous decision, the court addressed each objection in turn.

In response to the first objection, the court declared that since the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] had been accepted as valid for more than fifty years, and dealt with a similar matter (in this case, that voting rights could not be denied on account of race), it could not be argued that the new amendment was invalid due to its subject matter.

In response to the second objection, the court decided that when the state legislatures ratified the amendment, they were operating in a federal capacity as laid down in the Constitution, a role which "transcends any limitations sought to be imposed by the people of a state."

As far as the ratifications of Tennessee and West Virginia were concerned, the court remarked that the additional ratifications of [[Connecticut]] and [[Vermont]] after the proclamation of the amendment rendered the point [[mootness|moot]], but the court also addressed the substance of the objection.  The court found that as the Secretary of State had accepted the ratifications by the legislatures of the two states as valid, they were valid, effectively ruling the matter as non-[[justiciable]].[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Leser_v._Garnett/Opinion_of_the_Court]

This is a list of '''miscarriage of justice cases'''. This list includes cases where a convicted individual was later cleared of the crime and has received either an official exoneration, or a consensus exists that the individual was unjustly punished or where a conviction has been quashed and no retrial has taken place, so that the accused is assumed innocent. This list is not exhaustive. Crime descriptions with an asterisk indicate that the events were later determined not to be criminal acts.

|Buenos Aires
|30 years
|6 years
|Yes
|Fernando Carrera was wrongly suspected by police of carrying out a robbery in January 2005. He was stopped by police while driving, and as the officers failed to identify themselves as police, he panicked and tried to escape. The police then shot at his car as he escaped, and he was hit eight times. While unconscious, his car continued driving for 200 meters, and fatally ran down two women and a child. Carrera was taken to hospital in serious condition and survived. He was subsequently put on trial, and in June 2007 was convicted of robbery and aggravated manslaughter. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison, which was subsequently reduced to 15 years. Irregularities were found in his case. He was released on court order in 2013, though without being declared innocent. The [[Supreme Court of Argentina]] officially exonerated him in October 2016.&lt;ref name="infobae"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2016/10/25/masacre-de-pompeya-la-corte-suprema-absolvio-a-fernando-carrera/|title=Masacre de Pompeya: la Corte Suprema absolvió a Fernando Carrera|website=Infobae|accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lori Regional Court convicted Poghosyan of rape and murder in 1999. In 2003 following another offense, the real culprit was found, it became clear that the evidence against Poghosyan had been fabricated by the police and Poghosyan was freed.

|[[Gun Alley Murder|Rape and murder by strangulation of Alma Tirtschke]]
|[[Little Collins Street]], [[Melbourne, Australia]]
|Execution
|Executed
|Yes, posthumously exonerated
|Twelve-year-old Nell Alma Tirtschke left home on an errand for her grandmother. Early the next morning, her body was found in Gun Alley. She had been raped and strangled. Ross was convicted on the basis of several witnesses who testified that Ross confessed to them as well several strands of blonde hair on a blanket at Ross's house. In 1993, a former school teacher named Kevin Morgan began researching Ross's case. Morgan found a file in the Office of Public Prosecutions containing the original hair samples, which had been thought lost. In 1998, two independent scientific authorities - the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine and the forensics division of the Australian Federal Police - found that the two lots of hair did not come from the same person, thereby disproving with certainty the most damning piece of evidence presented at Colin Ross's trial. Colin Ross was pardoned on May 27, 2008, 86 years after his execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silvester|first=John|title=Ross cleared of murder nearly 90 years ago|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/bcrimeb-man-cleared-of-murder-86-years-after-he-was-executed/2008/05/26/1211653938453.html|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=The Age|date=2008-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Morgan (2012) ''Gun Alley: Murder, Lies and Failure of Justice'' (2nd ed., updated).

|[[Fremantle, Western Australia]]
|10 years
|5 years
|Yes
|Nineteen-year-old Button and his girlfriend Rosemary Anderson were celebrating his birthday at his parents' house. After an argument, Anderson decided to walk home. Button followed her in his car but she refused to get in and continued walking. Button stopped to smoke a cigarette before driving on. He found her lying injured and unconscious on the side of the road. She died later at the hospital.&lt;ref name="Why me"&gt;Button, J. Why Me Lord!. Perth: Digital Document Company. {{ISBN|0-646-36466-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 42}} Button had a bad stutter and police interpreted this as being nervous due to the questions he was being asked. Button was refused access to his parents or a lawyer and was hit once by an interviewing police officer,&lt;ref name="Why me"/&gt;{{rp|p 49}} before finally confessing to killing Anderson after 22 hours of interrogation. Damage to Button's car was also introduced at trial. He was charged with wilful murder and served 5 years in prison.

In 1963, Perth [[serial killer]], [[Eric Edgar Cooke]], confessed to the murder of Anderson when arrested in 1963 and again before he was executed. At his appeal, Trevor Condron, the police officer who had examined John Button's car in 1963 told the appeals court that while the car was damaged, the damage was not consistent with hitting a person and that three weeks before Anderson's death, Button had reported to police another accident. This accident report had been known to police at the original trial but been discounted as irrelevant. The court also heard from Dr Neil Turner who had treated Anderson.

|Attempted murder of his wife, Pamela Parsons
|Sylvania, New South Wales.
|18 years
|9 years
|Yes
|McLeod-Lindsay returned from work to find his wife Pamela and son Bruce severely beaten. Police developed the theory that he had slipped away from the hotel, attacked his family and returned to work, unnoticed. Blood on McLeod-Lindsay's jacket was said to have been “impact splatter”, and deposited during the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Bezjak, p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

Both victims survived the attack. Pamela McLeod-Lindsay was adamant that her husband had not attacked her. She said that the attacker had had an Australian accent. McLeod-Lindsay's accent was Scottish. McLeod-Lindsay was charged anyway with the attempted murder of his wife and son. The prosecution contended that Pamela McLeod-Lindsay was lying to protect the family's income. McLeod-Lindsay was found guilty.

McLeod-Lindsay was exonerated after a further review by another blood spatter pattern expert determined that the pattern was likely caused by transfer when he cradled his wife rather than by blows.&lt;ref name="Brown Malcolm"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Malcolm|title=Absolved 'ordinary man' dies|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/absolved-ordinary-man-dies-20090918-fvcu.html|agency=Sydney Morning Herald|date=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]
|Life in prison
|12 years
|No
|Harder was murdered by being shot several times in the chest and buried in a shallow grave near some railroad tracks. Police suspected Driskell of the murders because Harder implicated Driskell in a series of break-ins. The prosecution presented three hairs from Driskell's van that they argued belonged to Harder. A later review by the Forensic Science Services in England determined that none of the hairs belonged to Harder. It was later discovered that a key police witness, Ray Zanidean, tried to recant his testimony. In exchange for his testimony, police made a deal with Zanidean that he would not be charged in an arson case. He also received payment for his legal fees and received money for mortgage payments that were in arrears. He also received $20,000 payment. This information was not disclosed to the jury. Although he has not been formally exonerated, he was released on Nov. 24, 2003.&lt;ref name=Driskell&gt;{{cite news|title=James Driskell|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/driskell/|accessdate=29 April 2015|agency=CBC News|date=July 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1990 royal commission of inquiry criticized that finding as “a serious and fundamental error", blaming police incompetence and “systemic racism” for the conviction (Marshall is [[Mi’kmaq]]). His case led to widespread changes in Canada's evidence disclosure rules. Prosecutors had withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense in the Marshall case; the prosecution must now fully disclose to the defense any evidence it has in its possession.

|Stoppel was working at the Ideal Donut Shop in Winnipeg when she was found strangled in the restroom with a nylon cord. She died 5 days later. Witnesses gave police a description of a man wearing a cowboy hat enter the establishment, lock the door, and walk towards the back. Sophonow, who had a police record, bore a resemblance to the sketch. He was convicted on the basis of the eyewitness identification and a jailhouse informant who testified that Sophonow confessed to him. Sophonow was tried three times. The first ended in a mistrial, the second two in convictions. Both convictions were overturned and the court of appeal ordered an acquittal. The Winnipeg police service began a reinvestigation and in June 2000, they publicly announced that Sophonow was innocent and another suspect had been identified. In 2001, Justice Peter Cory concluded that police misconduct contributed to the wrongful conviction.

|Life in prison.

|Yes
|Tammy was home with her 2½ years old son Kenneth who was napping in their spare bedroom. When she checked on him, she found him tangled in the sheets and gasping for breath. Kenneth suffered irreparable brain damage and was taken off life support three days later. Dr. [[Charles Randal Smith|Charles Smith]], who was considered to be the leading expert in Canada on criminally suspicious pediatric deaths, was consulted on the case. Smith concluded that Kenneth's death was not accidental. Tammy's defense insisted her son died from complications of an epileptic seizure. She was convicted.

Smith's work subsequently came into question on a number of cases. On June 7, 2005, Chief Coroner for Ontario, Dr. Barry McLellan, announced that a formal review would be conducted of criminal cases for which Smith had performed the autopsy.

In October 2007, another forensic pathologist assigned to the case concluded that Smith's finding of asphyxia was “illogical and completely against scientific evidence-based reasoning.” In 2011, the Ontario Court of Appeal quashed her conviction and the Crown withdrew the charges against Tammy. Experts hired by the prosecution agreed that [[Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy]] (SUDEP) could not be ruled out as the cause of death in Kenneth's case as well as other natural cases of death.&lt;ref name=Marquardt&gt;{{cite news|title=Tammy Marquardt|url=http://www.aidwyc.org/cases/historical/tammy-marquardt/|accessdate=30 April 2015|agency=The Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Real Justice: Branded a Baby Killer: The Story of Tammy Marquardt|last=D'Costa|first=Jasmine|publisher=James Lorimer &amp; Company|year=2015|isbn=9781459409934|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Horst Arnold was a sports and biology teacher at the August Zinn comprehensive school in Reichelsheim. He was accused by a female colleague, Heidi K., of having raped her, and based on her testimony he was sentenced to five years of prison. Only after he was freed, an equal opportunity commissioner (who, at first, supported Heidi K. before and during the trial) noticed several contradictions in her stories. In prison, Arnold continued to deny the crime and refused therapy sessions, which was why he was denied early leave on parole. In the retrial, Arnold was exonerated, and in 2013, Heidi K. was sentenced to five years and six months.

|In January 1976, [[:he:עמוס ברנס|Amos Baranes]] was convicted for the 1974 murder of soldier Rachel Heller and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. He had had approached the police and told them he had known the victim, intending to offer his help any way he could, but he then became a suspect and was arrested. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. His conviction was based solely on a confession and reenaction he provided to police which he later retracted, claiming that the police had extracted the confession out of him by physically abusing him and depriving him of sleep for four days. An appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court was rejected, although errors in the investigation were acknowledged. In 1980, Ezra Goldberg, a retired policeman concluded that Baranes was innocent. He gave the information to Judge [[Haim Cohn]], one of the Supreme Court judges who had rejected his appeal. Cohn concluded that his judgement was wrong, and suggested Baranes to ask for a pardon. Baranes refused, claiming that such a request would be an admission of a crime he didn't commit. Cohn then asked President [[Chaim Herzog]] to grant Baranes a pardon. Baranes was finally released in June 1983 after receiving a presidential pardon. He had served 8.5 years of his sentence. Following his release, Baranes continued his struggle to clear his name. Three times his requests for a [[new trial]] were denied. In March 2002, Supreme Court Justice [[Dalia Dorner]] finally ruled that Baranes should get a new trial. Four weeks later, Judge Cohn died. His last phone conversation was with Justice Dorner; he called her from his sickbed and thanked her for fixing the injustice "that I did". Baranes was one of the people who carried Cohn's coffin at his funeral. In December 2002, the court acquitted Baranes - without hearing evidence and without deciding whether Baranes committed the crime after the prosecution decided not to have a trial. In 2003, Baranes was awarded [[New Israeli shekel|NIS]] 1.4&amp;nbsp;million in compensation. On August 5, 2010, he was awarded a further NIS 5,029,000 in compensation.

Naffso was interrogated and subjected to various forms of torture to extract a confession. After 14 days, Naffso confessed, and was tried before a military court in 1981, convicted, and sentenced to 18 years in prison. In 1987, he appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that his confession had been extracted illegally and that the prosecution had presented fabricated evidence. The Supreme Court judges cleared Naffso of most of the charges and sharply criticized Naffso's interrogators, accused them of [[perjury]], and of not taking reasonable measures during his interrogation. A plea bargain was reached, under which Naffso agreed to plead guilty to exceeding authority creating a national security risk. Naffso's sentence was reduced to 2 years and a demotion to the rank of Sergeant, and as a result, he was released immediately. The Naffso affair was one of the reasons the [[Landau Commission]], set up to investigate methods used by [[Shin Bet]], the Israeli internal security service, was set up. Naffso subsequently filed a compensation claim against the state, and reached a compromise under which he would be given $1&amp;nbsp;million in compensation and pledge not to publicly reveal details of the case.

It was soon noted that this was most likely an mis-identification due to confusion with a man bearing the same surname (meaning "turtledove"), but the ''pentiti'' kept on accusing Tortora of the gravest offenses related to drug dealing. He was sentenced to ten years in jail in his first trial held in 1985, being spared further incarceration only thanks to the providential intervention of the Radical Party who offered him a candidacy to the European Parliament, a place Tortora won in a landslide as the country became divided between those who held him guilty and those who held him innocent. He was completely acquitted and rehabilitated in 1986; he returned the next year to his work in TV, to a moving comeback in his "Portobello" show, to die in 1988 from cancer and become an icon of injustice and a perpetual reminder of the gravest public blunder of the Italian judiciary system.

|Kidnapping and ransom of Federal Investigations Agents

|21 years in prison
|3 years

|In March 2006, six plainclothes agents of [[Mexico]]'s [[Federal Investigations Agency]] (AFI) '''raided a market in Santiago Mexquititlán''', [[Querétaro]], in search of unauthorized copies of copyrighted works. During the raid, the six AFI agents were cornered by a number of unarmed vendors in protest. The agents later claimed that the vendors demanded a ransom to let them go. Local witnesses to the incident denied any ransom demand was made. Jacinta Francisco Marcial, an indigenous [[Otomi people|Otomí]] woman, sold ice cream in Santiago Mexquititlán's predominantly indigenous [[tianguis]]. The six AFI agents who conducted the raid implicated Francisco Marcial after they were shown a newspaper photograph depicting her walking near a group of protesting vendors. In August 2006, four months after the raid, she was arrested for the alleged kidnapping. She was later convicted and sentenced to twenty-one years imprisonment. Two other women were convicted as well.

[[Amnesty International]] denounced Francisco Marcial's imprisonment as resulting from a [[wrongful prosecution]]. The group declared her a [[prisoner of conscience]], claiming there was no credible evidence against her, and that she had been prosecuted because of her gender, poverty, race, and inability to speak or understand the Spanish language.

In 2009, prosecutors dropped the case against Francisco Marcial and she was released. The two other women convicted of the same charges, Alberta Alcántara and Teresa González, had their convictions reversed by the Mexican Supreme Court in April 2010 and were also released from  prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/indigenous-peoples/mexico-must-pay-indigenous-woman-wrongly-jailed-for-kidnapping-federal-agents/|title=Mexico Must Pay Indigenous Woman Wrongly Jailed for Kidnapping Federal Agents - Indian Country Media Network|last=Kearns|first=Rick|date=2014-07-19|website=Indian Country Media Network|language=en-US|access-date=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|In 2002, Dingaan Makuna, a policeman was killed during a failed hijacking. The police arrested several men, including Molaudzi, a Pretoria taxi driver. One of the co-defendants, (described later in court as a "reckless liar") said Molaudzi was one of the perpetrators although he later withdrew this confession. In spite of no other evidence linking him to the crime and the fact that Makuna's daughter who had witnessed the crime did not identify Moladuzi, he was convicted and sentenced to life in jail. Moladuzi spent his time in jail trying to prove his innocence (many of the court and police documents had mysteriously disappeared), was physically abused by the warders and spent four years in solitary confinement. In 2013 the Constitutional Court overturned his conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sapeople.com/2015/06/30/thembekile-molaudzi-wrongfully-convicted-south-african/|title=Wrongfully Convicted South African Man Released After 11 Years Behind Bars|last=Raphaely|first=Carolyn|date=2015-06-30|website=SA People News|publisher=|access-date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2015-06-30-for-thembekile-molaudzi-justice-delayed-was-justice-denied/#.V_e8T_QpXhp|title=For Thembekile Molaudzi, justice delayed was justice denied|last=|first=|date=|website=The Daily Maverick|publisher=|access-date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was dismissed by the local [[examining magistrate]] due to lack of evidence but it was reopened by his successor, Emilio Isasa Echenique, in 1913. Under Isasa's watch, Valero and Sánchez were arrested and extrajudicially [[torture]]d to make them confess. No body was found and the accused ended up claiming that they had fed it to pigs, then burned and grinded all remains left. After Grimaldos was found alive in [[Mira, Spain|Mira]] in 1926, the [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]] overturned the sentence and started proceedings against the responsible for the 1913 investigation.

|In the 1980s, a string of eleven child abductions shocked Switzerland. While eight of them were found dead, the whereabouts of the others is still unknown. Werner Ferrari, who had already killed a child in 1971 and had served 8 years of a 10-year sentence for that crime, was arrested and confessed to four of the murders in 1989, but vehemently denied having murdered Ruth Steinmann in 1980. He pled guilty to the four murders he confessed to, and was convicted of murdering Steinmann. In 1995, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Seven years later, journalist and author Peter Holenstein showed evidence that Ferrarri could not have killed Steinmann, including DNA analyis that a pubic hair found on her body did not match him. A subsequent comparison of [[dentures]] proved that the bite mark on her body did not come from him, but from a similar-looking man who had committed suicide in 1983. He was acquitted of Steinmann's murder in 2007. Due to the other murders, he remains in prison, serving a life sentence.

Christie was also responsible for the death of his own wife and six other women. Christie was the chief witness against Evans at his trial because the police accepted all of his statements as fact. The police were incompetent in several searches of the house at [[10 Rillington Place]], missing bones of earlier victims exposed in the tiny garden of the property.

|Yes
|Brown was convicted in 1977 of the murder of 51 year old Annie Walsh at her flat in Hulme, Greater Manchester. Despite numerous appeals, Brown's conviction was only declared 'unsafe' in 2002, when three appeal court judges heard how his confession was beaten out of him, the forensic evidence pointed to someone else and a report into police corruption (that led to Brown's interrogating officer being sent to prison for four years) was suppressed until days before his 2002 appeal. Brown was eligible for parole in 1992, but he refused to admit to a crime that he did not commit and so prolonged his sentence. Brown stated that clearing his name was more important than his freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hattenstone|first1=Simon|title=The extraordinary story of Robert Brown|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/mar/10/prisonsandprobation.simonhattenstone|accessdate=24 November 2017|work=The Guardian|date=10 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convictions were based solely on the analysis of the deaths by the Home Office Pathologist Alan Williams, who failed to disclose relevant information about the deaths, that was backed up by the paediatric professor [[Sir Roy Meadow]], whose opinion was pivotal in several other child death convictions, many of which have been overturned or are in the process of being disputed. In 2005 Williams was found guilty of serious professional misconduct and barred from practising pathology for 3 years. In July 2005 Meadow was also removed from the Medical Register for serious professional misconduct and prohibited from practising medicine.

'''McCarthy v Wellington City''' [1966] NZLR 481 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding the legal issue of [[Causation (law)|causation]] involving negligence cases in tort &lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The council had left a safe containing explosives unfastened to the ground and without any warning signs in a local quarry.

Some boys from a nearby suburb managed to open the safe by pulling out the pins on the hinges and took the explosives from the safe home with them.

The boys later gave some of the explosives to another boy, who later had one of the detonators explode in his hand, causing injury.

His parents sued the council for negligence. The council defended the matter by arguing that the injury was unforeseeable, and even if it was foreseeable, causation had been broken by the intervening act of a third party, namely by the boy giving the injured boy the detonator.

==Held==
The High Court ruled that the injury was foreseeable, and awarded damages, and this judgment was later upheld by the Court of Appeal.

'''Footnote:''' The Accident Compensation Act [1974] now bars such a claim

In 1974, Michael Mastro met [[divorcee]] Linda Ann Gale (b. 1949&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.seattleweekly.com/news/948284-129/mastro-linda-mastros-million-mike-hazelrigg|title=How to Go Bankrupt,  the  Millionaire’s  Way!|work=Seattle Weekly|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the [[Peoples Bank]] where they both worked, she as a [[loan officer]], he as [[branch manager]].&lt;ref name="seattleweekly.com"&gt;http://www.seattleweekly.com/home/948284-129/mastro-linda-mastros-mike-million-creditors&lt;/ref&gt; They were married on June 3, 1989.&lt;ref name=indictment&gt;http://www.assetsearchblog.com/files/2012/11/Mastro-indictment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Mastro sold office buildings, which he developed with a partner, to [[Boeing]] for $211 million. In the early 2000s Mastro started buying raw land for development of residential housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2005/07/25/story4.html?page=all | title=The ritual: Father and son, Mastros share lunches and profits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bankruptcy==
Mastro was forced into involuntary bankruptcy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jay Adkisson |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jayadkisson/2011/10/01/the-washington-woes-of-michael-mastro-and-friends/ |title=The Washington Woes Of Michael Mastro And Friends |publisher=Forbes |date=2012-04-18 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2009, and filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]]. On September 9, 2009, he listed assets in excess of $249 million and liabilities of over $586 million in a filing with the [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]] for the Western District of Washington.&lt;ref name=indictment/&gt;

In May 2010, a ruling was handed down by Bankruptcy Judge Samuel Steiner that two diamond rings valued at $1.4 million were not available to creditors since they belonged to Linda Mastro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frank |first=Robert |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/wealth/2010/07/19/living-large-in-bankruptcy/ |title=Michael Mastro Is Living Large in Bankruptcy - The Wealth Report - WSJ |publisher=Blogs.wsj.com |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011,  Mastro suffered a head injury while residing in [[Palm Desert]]. He was hospitalized for two weeks and underwent [[brain surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2012/11/mastros-mental-competency-could-be-an.html |title=Mastro's mental competency could be an issue in French court this week, lawyer says - Puget Sound Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2012-11-05 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

June 2011 a judge ordered Michael and Linda Mastro to hand over the two diamond rings owned by Mrs. Mastro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2223310/Michael-Mastro-Seattle-real-estate-magnate-arrested-France-fleeing-bankruptcy.html|title=Bankrupt real estate magnate and wife arrested in France one year after skipping out on $250M debts and refusing to hand over $1.4M diamond rings|accessdate=28 October 2012 | location=London|work=Daily Mail|first=Michael|last=Zennie|date=2012-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013 it was reported that the bankruptcy trustee, James Rigby, had filed an 82-page report which valued all the jewelry seized from the Mastros at $3 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2020997737_mastrobankruptcyxml.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Mastro's bankruptcy is believed to be the largest personal bankruptcy ever in the state of Washington.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Bankruptcy fraud and money laundering==
The couple did not comply with the judge's order to hand over the diamond rings and disappeared in June 2011.&lt;ref name=" Pryne"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pryne |first=Eric |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2019644569_mastrorejectedxml.html |title=Mastros to remained in a French jail after judges refuse appeal &amp;#124; Business &amp; Technology |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011 a [[Record sealing|sealed]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; criminal complaint was filed against Michael Mastro and his wife Linda charging them with bankruptcy fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2013/06/french_court_denies_extraditio.html | work=The Oregonian | title=French court denies extradition request for former Seattle real estate investor | date=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; After warrants for contempt of court (a [[civil violation]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) were issued for their arrest they were apprehended and taken into custody in France on October 24, 2012.&lt;ref name=" Pryne" /&gt;

On October 25, 2012, a day after being arrested in France, Mastro and his wife, Linda were [[indict]]ed by a [[federal grand jury]] on forty three counts of [[bankruptcy fraud]] and [[money laundering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bill Singer |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billsinger/2012/10/26/rolls-royce-diamonds-gold-coins-wines-cited-in-couples-bankruptcy-fraud/ |title=Rolls Royce, Diamonds, Gold Coins, Wines Cited In Couple's Bankruptcy Fraud |publisher=Forbes |date=2012-04-18 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They were accused of hiding assets from creditors.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Captured-Medina-developer-Mastro-wife-indicted-3982488.php#ixzz2By2WjJf0 |title=Captured Medina developer Mastro, wife indicted |publisher=seattlepi.com |date=2012-10-25 |accessdate=2012-11-29 |first=Levi |last=Pulkkinen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The couple remained in custody in [[Chambéry]] after a hearing held on Nov 7, 2012.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kepes |first=Laure |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2019620304_mastroargumentsxml.html |title=Lawyer seeks no jail for Mastro &amp;#124; Business &amp; Technology |publisher=The Seattle Times |date= |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A panel of three French judges rejected the couple's plea, based on their age and poor health, for a conditional release. The court felt that the charges against them for bankruptcy fraud and money laundering were serious enough to keep them in jail until such time as the US files for extradition. Prior to their arrest the Mastros were pursued by both the [[FBI]] and [[U.S. marshal]]s for sixteen months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2012/11/mastros-must-remain-in-jail-french.html |title=Mastros must remain in jail, French court rules - Puget Sound Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Nov 15, 2012, the [[Seattle Times|''Seattle Times'']] reported that the two diamond rings were in  French authorities' possession. According to Thomas Terrier, the Mastro’s French lawyer, the rings were in a safety box in [[Annecy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pryne |first=Eric |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2019689077_mastroringsxml.html |title=Mastros’ $1.4 million diamond rings recovered, attorney says &amp;#124; Business &amp; Technology |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=2012-11-15 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2012, the ''Seattle Times'' reported that Michael and Linda Mastro had been released from jail after being [[incarcerate]]d for seven weeks. A three-judge panel ruled that their health was suffering. They were to wear electronic monitoring devices and were free to walk around Annecy.

By December 12, 2012, the United States had  not filed for extradition, which according to James Rigby, the United States court-appointed [[bankruptcy trustee]], must be filed by December 26, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2019888639_mastrosreleasedxml.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extradition from France to the United States==
On February 23, 2013, the ''Seattle Times'' reported that the [[Court of Appeals]] in [[Chambery, France]] ruled that the Mastros cannot be extradited to the United States unless American authorities guarantee that the couple will not face any sanctions other than electronic surveillance. The extradition treaty between France and the United States allows France to deny extradition when the extradited party faces serious consequences related to health or age. Michael Mastro and his wife had been wearing surveillance devices but were freed after spending seven weeks in a French jail.
&lt;ref&gt;http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2020411359_mastrohearingxml.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2013, [[La cour d'appel]] de Chambéry denied the extradition of Michael and Linda Mastro from [[France]] to the [[United States]] basing this decision on Michael Mastro’s age (88), poor health, and daily dependence on his wife.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://alpes.france3.fr/2013/06/05/la-cour-d-appel-de-chambery-refuse-l-extradition-du-couple-mastro-vers-les-etats-unis-264417.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal was filed by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2021123625_mastrofreedxml.html
&lt;/ref&gt; The United States request that the case be taken to the [[French Supreme Court]] was turned down by French prosecutors who found no grounds for appeal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, the couple are no longer prevented from leaving their home in the evenings.&lt;ref&gt;http://bellevue.patch.com/groups/police-and-fire/p/french-court-declines-to-extradite-michael-and-linda-mastro&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movement of Mastros after financial problems surfaced ==
Before their bankruptcy the Mastros lived in a large waterfront house in [[Medina]], a city in the [[:Category:Cities in the Seattle metropolitan area|Seattle metropolitan area]]. They moved to [[California]] in 2010. In 2011 they started a journey that began at Mr. Mastro’s sister's house in Seattle, went on to [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada and according to investigators [[Focus Ltd.]] ended in a €5,000 per month house in [[Veyrier-du-Lac, France]], on the eastern shore of [[Lake Annecy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/23/michael-mastro-flee-law-at-87 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Simon | last=Goodley | title=On the trail of Michael Mastro: how to flee the law when you are 87 | date=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then they moved to [[Marceau, France]] where the Mastros were arrested in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2019510730_mastro25.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related bankruptcy of Tom Hazelrigg III==
Tom Hazelrigg is a longtime business associate of Michael Mastro who was forced into bankruptcy by James Rigby and two other creditors in February 2012. On December 14, 2012  judge Timothy Dore denied Hazelrigg a discharge of his debt. Hazelrigg owed Mastro $76 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2012/12/mastro-creditor-hazelrigg-loses-round.html | title=Mastro creditor Hazelrigg loses round in court}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015 he was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for [[Tax evasion in the United States|tax evasion]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/hazelrigg-gets-45-year-sentence-for-tax-evasion/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/morning_call/2015/03/mastro-associate-tom-hazelrigg-iii-appeals-prison.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy surrounding sale of Mastro’s Medina home==
In November 2012 judge [[Marc Barreca]] denied Jack Dorssers, a former business associate of Mastro, a share in the $8.36 million  proceeds from the sale of Mastro’s Medina, Washington home. The judge ruled that the contention that Mastro had put up the house as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] in 2009 for a $1.2 million loan was a [[Fraud|sham]] designed to keep the house away from the reach of other Mastro [[creditors]]. Jack Dorsser is appealing Barreca’s decision.&lt;ref&gt;http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2016599610_dorssers25.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appeal ==
On September 9, 2014  Rami Grunbaum of the ''Seattle Times'' wrote that  a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that Linda Mastro  is entitled to appeal the bankruptcy court ruling about her assets.

The pact secretly delineated the [[spheres of interest]] between the two powers, confirmed by the supplementary protocol of the [[German–Soviet Frontier Treaty]] amended after the [[invasion of Poland]]. It remained in force for nearly two years, until the German government of [[Adolf Hitler]] ended the pact by launching an attack on the Soviet positions in Eastern Poland during [[Operation Barbarossa]] on 22 June 1941.&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/230972/German-Soviet-Nonaggression-Pact | title=A secret supplementary protocol of September 28, 1939 | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica | work=German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact | date=2015 | accessdate=14 November 2015 | author=Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clauses of the Nazi–Soviet Pact provided a written guarantee of [[Non-belligerent|non-belligerence]] by each party towards the other, and a declared commitment that neither government would ally itself to, or aid, an enemy of the other party. In addition to stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included a secret protocol that divided territories of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], and [[Romania]] into German and Soviet "[[spheres of influence]]", anticipating "territorial and political rearrangements" of these countries. Thereafter, [[Invasion of Poland|Germany invaded]] Poland on 1 September 1939. Soviet Union leader [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September, one day after a Soviet–Japanese ceasefire at the [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]] came into effect.{{Sfn|Goldman|2012|pp=163–64}} In March 1940, parts of the [[Karelia]] and [[Salla]] regions in Finland were annexed by the Soviet Union after the [[Winter War]]. This was followed by Soviet [[annexation]]s of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of [[Romania]] ([[Bessarabia]], Northern [[Bukovina]], and the [[Hertza region]]). Advertised concern about ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians had been proffered as justification for the Soviet invasion of Poland. Stalin's invasion of Bukovina in 1940 violated the pact, as it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence agreed with the Axis.&lt;ref&gt;Brackman, Roman ''The Secret File of Joseph Stalin: A Hidden Life'' (2001) p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union]] after the 1939 Nazi–[[Soviet invasion of Poland]] remained in the USSR at the end of World War II. The new border was set up along the [[Curzon Line]]. Only the region around [[Białystok]] and a small part of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] east of the [[San river]] around [[Przemyśl]] were [[Border Agreement between Poland and the USSR of 16 August 1945|returned to the Polish state]] from that line. Of all other territories annexed by the USSR in 1939–40, the ones detached from Finland ([[Karelia]], [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]]), Estonia ([[Ingria#Estonian Ingria|Ingrian area]] and [[Petseri County]]) and Latvia ([[Abrene district|Abrene]]) remain part of the [[Russian Federation]], the successor state of the USSR upon the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. The territories annexed from Romania had also been integrated into the Soviet Union (as the [[Moldavian SSR]], or oblasts of the [[Ukrainian SSR]]); nowadays, the core of Bessarabia forms [[Moldova]], while the northern part of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and Hertza form the [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] of Ukraine, and [[Southern Bessarabia]] is part of the [[Odessa Oblast]], also in [[Ukraine]].

After the war, von Ribbentrop was convicted of [[war crime]]s and executed. Molotov died aged 96 in 1986, five years before the USSR's dissolution.

The existence of the secret protocol was denied by the Soviet government until 1989, when it was finally acknowledged and denounced.&lt;ref name="chathamhouse.org, 2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/ia/archive/view/164427|title=Russian historians defend the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Putin]] while condemning the pact as 'immoral' has also defended the pact as a "[[necessary evil]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/vladimir-putin/11213255/Vladimir-Putin-says-there-was-nothing-wrong-with-Soviet-Unions-pact-with-Adolf-Hitlers-Nazi-Germany.html |work= [[Daily Telegraph]] |first= Tom |last= Parfitt |title= Vladimir Putin says there was nothing wrong with Soviet Union's pact with Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany |date= 6 November 2014 |accessdate= 20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Snyder, NYreview of books,[http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/nov/10/putin-nostalgia-stalin-hitler/ putin nostalgia hitler stalin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Soviet–German relations before 1941|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations}}
The outcome of [[World War I]] was disastrous for both the [[Weimar Republic|German Reich]] and the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]]. During the war, the [[Bolsheviks]] struggled for survival, and [[Vladimir Lenin]] recognised the independence of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Moreover, facing a German military advance, Lenin and [[Trotsky]] were forced to enter into the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/The_Peace_Treaty_of_Brest-Litovsk|date=3 March 1918|title=Peace Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|publisher=BYU|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which ceded massive western Russian territories to the [[German Empire]]. After Germany's collapse, [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|a multinational Allied-led army]] intervened in the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–22).{{Sfn|Montefiore|2005|p=32}}

On 16 April 1922, Germany and the Soviet Union entered the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]], pursuant to which they renounced territorial and financial claims against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/interwar/rapallo.htm|title=German–Russian agreement|place=Rapallo|date=16 April 1922|publisher=Mt Holyoke|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Each party further pledged neutrality in the event of an attack against the other with the [[Treaty of Berlin (1926)|1926 Treaty of Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/berlin_001.asp|title=Treaty of Berlin Between the Soviet Union and Germany|date=24 April 1926|publisher=Yale|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While trade between the two countries fell sharply after World War I, trade agreements signed in the mid-1920s helped to increase trade to 433 million [[Reichsmark]]s per year by 1927.{{Sfn|Ericson|1999|pp=14–5}}

At the beginning of the 1930s, the [[Nazi Party]]'s [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|rise to power]] increased tensions between Germany and the Soviet Union along with other countries with ethnic [[Slavs]], who were considered "[[Untermensch]]en" (inferior) according to [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial ideology]].{{Sfn|Bendersky|2000|p=177}} Moreover, the [[anti-Semitic]] Nazis associated ethnic Jews with both [[communism]] and [[financial capitalism]], [[Third Position|both of which they opposed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Stephen J|last2=Paul|first2=Shuter|title=Weimar and Nazi Germany|publisher=Heinemann|year=1996|isbn=0-435-30920-X|page=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Bendersky|2000|p=159}} Nazi theory held that Slavs in the Soviet Union were being ruled by "[[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevik]]" masters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller|first1=Rolf-Dieter|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Hitler_s_War_in_the_East_1941_1945.html?id=IfHaDYVfGlgC|first2=Gerd R|last2=Ueberschär|title=Hitler's War in the East, 1941–1945: A Critical Assessment|publisher=Berghahn|year=2002|isbn=978-1-57181-293-3|page=244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, Hitler himself had spoken of an inescapable battle against both [[Pan-Slavism]] and Neo-Slavism, the victory in which would lead to "permanent mastery of the world", though he stated that they would "walk part of the road with the Russians, if that will help us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rauschning|first=Hermann|title=Hitler Speaks: A Series of Political Conversations With Adolf Hitler on His Real Aims|publisher=Kessinger|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4286-0034-8|pages=136–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting manifestation of German anti-Bolshevism and an increase in Soviet foreign debts caused German–Soviet trade to dramatically decline.{{Efn|To 53 million RM in German imports (0.9% of Germany's total imports and 6.3% of Russia's total exports) and 34 million RM in German exports (0.6% of Germany's total exports and 4.6% of Russia's total imports) in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ericson|first=Edward E III|title=Karl Schnurre and the Evolution of Nazi–Soviet Relations, 1936–1941|journal=German Studies Review|volume=21|date=May 1998|pages=263–83|issue=2|doi=10.2307/1432205|ref=harv|jstor=1432205}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Imports of Soviet goods to Germany fell to 223 million Reichsmarks in 1934 as the more [[isolationist]] [[Stalinist]] regime asserted power and the abandonment of post–World War I [[Treaty of Versailles]] military controls decreased Germany's reliance on Soviet imports.{{Sfn|Ericson|1999|pp=14–5}}{{Sfn|Hehn|2005|p=212}}{{clarify |reason=Hehn 2005 sfn ref missing citation |date=July 2014}}

===Munich Agreement===
Hitler's fierce anti-Soviet rhetoric was one of the reasons why Britain and France decided that Soviet participation in the 1938 [[Munich Conference]] regarding [[Czechoslovakia]] would be both dangerous and useless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hitler and Russia|newspaper=The Times|date=June 24, 1941|place=London}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Munich Agreement]] that followed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|place=Munich|date=29 September 1938|publisher=Yale|url=http://avalon.law.yae.edu/imt/munich1.asp|title=Agreement concluded at between Germany, Great Britain, France and Italy}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt; marked a partial [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German annexation]] of Czechoslovakia in late 1938 followed by its complete dissolution in March 1939,{{Sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=157–8}} which was part of the [[appeasement]] of Germany conducted by [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]]'s and [[Édouard Daladier|Daladier]]'s cabinets.{{Sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=124}} This policy immediately raised the question of whether the Soviet Union could avoid being next on Hitler's list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Max|last=Beloff|title=Soviet Foreign Policy, 1929–41: Some Notes|journal=Soviet Studies|volume=2|date=Oct 1950|pages=123–37|issue=2|doi=10.1080/09668135008409773|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet leadership believed that the West wanted to encourage German aggression in the East{{Sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=194}} and that France and Britain might stay neutral in a war initiated by Germany, hoping that the warring states would wear each other out and put an end to both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Carr|1949}}

For Germany, because an [[Autarky|autarkic]] economic approach or an alliance with Britain were impossible, closer relations with the Soviet Union to obtain raw materials became necessary, if not just for economic reasons alone.{{Sfn|Ericson|1999|pp=1–2}} Moreover, an expected British blockade in the event of war would create massive shortages for Germany in a number of key raw materials.{{Sfn|Ericson|1999|pp=3–4}} After the Munich agreement, the resulting increase in German military supply needs and Soviet demands for military machinery, talks between the two countries occurred from late 1938 to March 1939.{{Sfn|Ericson|1999|pp=29–35}} The third Soviet [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five Year Plan]] required new infusions of technology and industrial equipment.{{Sfn|Ericson|1999|pp=1–2}}{{Sfn|Hehn|2005|pp=42–43}}{{clarify |reason=Hehn 2005 sfn ref missing citation |date=July 2014}} German war planners had estimated serious shortfalls of raw materials if Germany entered a war without Soviet supply.{{Sfn|Ericson|1999|p=44}}

On 31 March 1939, in response to Nazi Germany's defiance of the Munich Agreement and [[occupation of Czechoslovakia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Martin|last1=Collier|first2=Philip|last2=Pedley|title=Germany, 1919–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain pledged its support and that of [[French Third Republic|France]] to guarantee the independence of Poland, Belgium, Romania, Greece, and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Hermann|last1=Kinder|first2=Werner|last2=Hilgemann|title=The Anchor Atlas of World History|volume=II|page=165|publisher=Anchor Press, Doubleday|place=New York|year=1978|isbn=0-385-13355-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April Poland and Britain agreed to [[Anglo-Polish military alliance|formalize the guarantee as a military alliance]], pending negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrew J|last=Crozier|title=The Causes of the Second World War|page=151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 April, Hitler denounced the 1934 [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] and the 1935 [[Anglo–German Naval Agreement]].&lt;ref name=radio&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=12dk9bizqIAC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq=abrogated+hitler+reichstag|title=Manipulating the Ether: The Power of Broadcast Radio in Thirties America|first=Robert J|last=Brown|isbn=0-7864-2066-9|date=2004-01-01}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in mid-March 1939, in attempts to contain Hitler's expansionism, the Soviet Union, Britain and France traded a flurry of suggestions and counterplans regarding a potential political and military agreement.{{sfn|Carley|1993}}{{Sfn|Watson|2000|pp=696–8}} Although informal consultations commenced in April, the main negotiations began only in May.{{Sfn|Watson|2000|pp=696–8}} At the same time, throughout early 1939, Germany had secretly hinted to Soviet diplomats that it could offer better terms for a political agreement than Britain and France.{{Sfn|Roberts|2006|p=30}}&lt;ref name=tent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/nazsov.asp|title=Tentative Efforts To Improve German–Soviet Relations, April 17 – August 14, 1939|publisher=Yale}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grogin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Natural Enemies: The United States and the Soviet Union in the Cold War, 1917–1991|first=Robert C|last=Grogin|year=2001|publisher=Lexington|page=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union, which feared Western powers and the possibility of "capitalist encirclements", had little faith either that war could be avoided, or faith in the [[Polish army]], and wanted nothing less than an ironclad military alliance with France and Britain{{sfn|Carley|1993|p =324}} that would provide a guaranteed support for a two-pronged attack on Germany;{{Sfn|Watson|2000|p=695}} thus, Stalin's adherence to the collective security line was purely conditional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|type=review of Raack, R, ''Stalin's Drive to the West, 1938–1945: The Origins of the Cold War''|title=The Journal of Modern History|first=G|last=Roberts|volume=69|date=December 1997|page=787|issue=4|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain and France believed that war could still be avoided, and that the Soviet Union, weakened by the [[Great Purge]],{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=118}} could not be a main military participant,{{Sfn|Watson|2000|p=695}} a point that many military sources{{clarify|date=May 2017}} were at variance with, especially given the [[Soviet–Japanese border conflicts|Soviet victories]] over the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]] on the [[Manchuria]]n frontier.{{sfn|Carley|1993|pp=303–41}} France was more anxious to find an agreement with the USSR than was Britain; as a continental power, it was more willing to make concessions and more fearful of the dangers of an agreement between the USSR and Germany.{{Sfn|Watson|2000|p=696}} These contrasting attitudes partly explain why the USSR has often been charged with playing a double game in 1939: carrying on open negotiations for an alliance with Britain and France while secretly considering propositions from Germany.{{Sfn|Watson|2000|p=696}}

By the end of May, drafts were formally presented.{{Sfn|Watson|2000|pp=696–8}} In mid-June, the main Tripartite negotiations started.{{Sfn|Watson|2000|p=704}} The discussion was focused on potential guarantees to central and east European countries should a German aggression arise.{{sfn|Carley|1993|pp=322–3}} The USSR proposed to consider that a political turn towards Germany by the [[Baltic states]] would constitute an "indirect aggression" towards the Soviet Union.{{Sfn|Watson|2000|p=708}} Britain opposed such proposals, because they feared the Soviets' proposed language could justify a Soviet intervention in Finland and the Baltic states, or push those countries to seek closer relations with Germany.{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|p=502}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hiden|first=John|title=The Baltic and the Outbreak of the Second World War|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-521-53120-9|page=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion about a definition of "indirect aggression" became one of the sticking points between the parties, and by mid-July, the tripartite political negotiations effectively stalled, while the parties agreed to start negotiations on a military agreement, which the Soviets insisted must be entered into simultaneously with any political agreement.{{Sfn|Watson|2000|pp=710–1}} One day before the military negotiations began, the politburo of CPSU, pessimistically expecting that the coming negotiations were going nowhere, formally decided to consider German proposals seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Gromyko|first1=Andrei |url=https://www.alibris.com/Soviet-foreign-policy-1917-1980-Andrei-Andreevich-Gromyko/book/6233636?collectible=1&amp;qsort=p&amp;matches=1|first2=B.

From April to July, Soviet and German officials made statements regarding the potential for the beginning of political negotiations, while no actual negotiations took place during that time period.{{Sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=107–11}} "The Soviet Union had wanted good relations with Germany for years and was happy to see that feeling finally reciprocated" says historian Gerhard L.

In early August, Germany and the Soviet Union worked out the last details of their economic deal,{{Sfn|Ericson|1999|p=56}} and started to discuss a political alliance. They explained to each other the reasons for their foreign policy hostility in the 1930s, finding common ground in the [[anti-capitalism]]{{clarify|date=March 2017}} of both countries.{{Sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|p=115}}{{Sfn|Fest|2002|pp=589–90}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bertriko|first1=Jean-Jacques|last2=Subrenat|first2=A|first3=David|last3=Cousins|title=Estonia: Identity and Independence|publisher=Rodopi|year=2004|isbn=90-420-0890-3|page=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, British, French, and Soviet negotiators scheduled three-party talks on military matters to occur in Moscow in August 1939, aiming to define what the agreement would specify should be the reaction of the three powers to a German attack.{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|p=502}} The [[tripartite military talks]], started in mid-August, hit a sticking point regarding the passage of Soviet troops through Poland if Germans attacked, and the parties waited as British and French officials overseas pressured Polish officials to agree to such terms.{{Sfn|Watson|2000|p=713}}{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|p=536}} Polish officials refused to allow Soviet troops into Polish territory if Germany attacked; [[Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs|Polish foreign minister]] [[Józef Beck]] pointed out that the Polish government feared that once the Red Army entered their territory, it might never leave.{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|p=537}}&lt;ref name="Cienciala"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Anna M|last=Cienciala|author-link=Anna M.

On August 19, the [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|1939 German–Soviet Commercial Agreement]] was finally signed.{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|p=525}} On 21 August, the Soviets suspended the tripartite military talks, citing other reasons.{{Sfn|Roberts|2006|p=30}}{{Sfn|Watson|2000|p=715}} That same day, Stalin received assurance that Germany would approve secret protocols to the proposed non-aggression pact that would place half of Poland (east of the [[Vistula]] river), [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], and [[Bessarabia]] in the Soviets' sphere of influence.&lt;ref name="murphy23"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=David E|title=What Stalin Knew: The Enigma of Barbarossa|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2006|isbn=0-300-11981-X|page=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That night, Stalin replied that the Soviets were willing to sign the pact and that he would receive Ribbentrop on 23 August.{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|p=528}}

==The secret protocol==
On 22 August, one day after the talks broke down with France and Britain, Moscow revealed that Ribbentrop would visit Stalin the next day. This happened while the Soviets were still negotiating with the British and French missions in Moscow. With the Western nations unwilling to accede to Soviet demands, Stalin instead entered a secret Nazi–Soviet pact.{{sfn|Watt|1989|p=367}} On 24 August a 10-year [[non-aggression pact]] was signed with provisions that included: consultation, arbitration if either party disagreed, neutrality if either went to war against a third power, no membership of a group "which is directly or indirectly aimed at the other". The article "On Soviet–German Relations" in the Soviet newspaper ''[[Izvestia]]'' of August 21, 1939, stated:
{{bquote|Following completion of the Soviet–German trade and credit agreement, there has arisen the question of improving political links between Germany and the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8216847.stm Media build up to World War II], ''[[BBC News]]'', August 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact 2.gif|thumb|right|Last page of the ''Additional Secret Protocol'' of the Pact]]

There was also a secret protocol to the pact, revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945,&lt;ref name="mrtext"/&gt; although hints about its provisions were leaked much earlier, e.g., to influence Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;Ceslovas Laurinavicius, "The Lithianian Reaction to the Loss of Klaipeda and the Combined Gift of Soviet "Security Assistance and Vilnius", in: ''Northern European Overture to War, 1939–1941: From Memel to Barbarossa'', 2013, {{ISBN|90-04-24909-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the protocol, Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland were divided into German and Soviet "[[spheres of influence]]".&lt;ref name="mrtext"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1939pact.html|title=Text of the Nazi–Soviet Non-Aggression Pact|date=23 August 1939|publisher=Fordham|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, Finland, Estonia and Latvia were assigned to the Soviet sphere.&lt;ref name="mrtext" /&gt; Poland was to be partitioned in the event of its "political rearrangement": the areas east of the [[Pisa (river)|Pisa]], [[Narev]], [[Vistula]] and [[San (river)|San]] rivers would go to the Soviet Union, while Germany would occupy the west.&lt;ref name="mrtext"/&gt; Lithuania, adjacent to [[East Prussia]], would be in the German sphere of influence, although a second secret protocol agreed to in September 1939 reassigned the majority of Lithuania to the USSR.&lt;ref name="christie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Christie|first=Kenneth|title=Historical Injustice and Democratic Transition in Eastern Asia and Northern Europe: Ghosts at the Table of Democracy|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|year=2002|isbn=0-7007-1599-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the protocol, Lithuania would be granted its historical capital [[Vilnius]], which was under Polish control during the [[Polish–Lithuanian War|inter-war period]]. Another clause of the treaty stipulated that Germany would not interfere with the Soviet Union's actions towards [[Bessarabia]], then part of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]];&lt;ref name="mrtext" /&gt; as a result, not only Bessarabia, but [[Northern Bukovina]] and [[Hertza region|Hertza]] regions too, were [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|occupied by the Soviets]], and integrated into the Soviet Union.

At the signing, Ribbentrop and Stalin enjoyed warm conversations, exchanged toasts and further addressed the prior hostilities between the countries in the 1930s.{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|p=539}} They characterized Britain as always attempting to disrupt Soviet–German relations, stated that the [[Anti-Comintern pact]] was not aimed at the Soviet Union, but actually aimed at Western democracies and "frightened principally the City of London [i.e., the British financiers] and the English shopkeepers".{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|p=540}}

On 24 August, ''[[Pravda]]'' and ''Izvestia'' carried news of the non-secret portions of the Pact, complete with the now infamous front-page picture of Molotov signing the treaty, with a smiling Stalin looking on.{{Sfn|Roberts|2006|p=30}} The news was met with utter shock and surprise by government leaders and media worldwide, most of whom were aware only of the British–French–Soviet negotiations that had taken place for months.{{Sfn|Roberts|2006|p=30}} The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was received with shock by Nazi Germany's allies, notably Japan, by the [[Comintern]] and foreign communist parties, and by Jewish communities all around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rUdmyzkw9q4C&amp;pg=PA597&amp;lpg=PA597&amp;dq=jewish+shock++nazi+soviet+1939#v=onepage&amp;q=jewish%20shock%20%20nazi%20soviet%201939&amp;f=true|editor-first=Ruud|editor-last=van Dijk|title=Encyclopedia of the Cold War|place=London|year=2008|page=597|isbn=978-0-415-97515-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, German diplomat [[Hans von Herwarth]] (whose grandmother was Jewish) informed Guido Relli, an Italian diplomat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aESBIpIm6UcC&amp;pg=PA507&amp;lpg=PA507&amp;dq=hans+von+herwarth+jewish#v=onepage&amp;q=hans%20von%20herwarth%20jewish&amp;f=false|editor-first=Bernd|editor-last=Wegner|title=From Peace to War: Germany, Soviet Russia and the World, 1939–1941|place=Providence and Oxford|publisher=Berghahn|year=1997|isbn=978-1-57181-882-9|page=507}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and American chargé d'affaires [[Charles Bohlen]] on the secret protocol regarding vital interests in the countries' allotted "spheres of influence", without revealing the annexation rights for "territorial and political rearrangement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sławomir|last=Dębski|title=Między Berlinem a Moskwą.

''[[Time Magazine]]'' repeatedly referred to the Pact as the "Communazi Pact" and its participants as "communazis" until April 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,711757-1,00.html|title=Arms &amp; Art|date=September 11, 1939|work=Time}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762584,00.html|title=Children of Moscow|date=September 18, 1939}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762664-2,00.html|title=Moscow's Week|date=October 9, 1939}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762675,00.html|title=Revival|date=October 9, 1939}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,789816-2,00.html|title=Communazi Columnists|date=June 3, 1940}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,765178,00.html|title=The Revolt of the Intellectuals|date=January 6, 1941|first=Whittaker|last=Chambers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,765427,00.html|title=In Again, Out Again|date=April 7, 1941}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Soviet propaganda]] and representatives went to great lengths to minimize the importance of the fact that they had opposed and fought against the Nazis in various ways for a decade prior to signing the Pact. Upon signing the pact, Molotov tried to reassure the Germans of his good intentions by commenting to journalists that "fascism is a matter of taste".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Fulton John|last=Sheen|title=Communism and the Conscience of the West|publisher=Bobbs–Merrill|year=1948|page=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For its part, Nazi Germany also did a public [[volte-face]] regarding its virulent opposition to the Soviet Union, though Hitler still viewed an attack on the Soviet Union as "inevitable".{{citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Concerns over the possible existence of a secret protocol were first expressed by the intelligence organizations of the Baltic states{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} scant days after the pact was signed. Speculation grew stronger when Soviet negotiators referred to its content during negotiations for military bases in those countries (see [[occupation of the Baltic States]]).

The day after the Pact was signed, the French and British military negotiation delegation urgently requested a meeting with Soviet military negotiator [[Kliment Voroshilov]].{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=541–2}} On August 25, Voroshilov told them "[i]n view of the changed political situation, no useful purpose can be served in continuing the conversation."{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=541–2}} That day, Hitler told the British ambassador to Berlin that the pact with the Soviets prevented Germany from facing a two front war, changing the strategic situation from that in World War I, and that Britain should accept his demands regarding Poland.{{Sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|p=123}}

On 25 August, surprising Hitler, [[Anglo-Polish military alliance|Britain entered into a defense pact with Poland]].{{Sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|p=123}} Consequently, Hitler postponed his planned 26 August [[invasion of Poland]] to 1 September.{{Sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|p=123}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frank|last=McDonough|title=Neville Chamberlain, Appeasement and the British Road to War|page=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the defense pact, Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljAyEEiVG-sC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;dq=Britain+France+guarantee+Poland&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwA2oVChMIx_iHiIHAxwIVk7aACh2jpgDo#v=onepage&amp;q=Britain%20France%20guarantee%20Poland&amp;f=false | title=Avoiding Armageddon: From the Great War to the Fall of France, 1918–40 | publisher=A&amp;C Black | author=Black, Jeremy | year=2012 | page=251 | isbn=978-1-4411-5713-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven days after the Soviet invasion of the Polish [[Kresy]], the secret protocol of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was modified by the [[German–Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/nazsov/gsbound.htm|title=German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty|publisher=Yale|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; allotting Germany a larger part of Poland and transferring [[Lithuania]]'s territory (with the exception of the left bank of river [[Šešupė|Scheschupe]], the "Lithuanian Strip") from the envisioned German sphere to the Soviets.&lt;ref name="wettig20"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wettig|first=Gerhard|title=Stalin and the Cold War in Europe|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|place=Landham, [[Maryland|MD]], US|year=2008|isbn=0-7425-5542-9|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 September 1939, the Soviet Union and German Reich issued a joint declaration in which they declared:
{{Quote|After the Government of the German Reich and the Government of the USSR have, by means of the treaty signed today, definitively settled the problems arising from the collapse of the Polish state and have thereby created a sure foundation for a lasting peace in the region, they mutually express their conviction that it would serve the true interest of all peoples to put an end to the state of war existing at present between Germany on the one side and England and France on the other. Both Governments will therefore direct their common efforts, jointly with other friendly powers if occasion arises, toward attaining this goal as soon as possible.

Should, however, the efforts of the two Governments remain fruitless, this would demonstrate the fact that England and France are responsible for the continuation of the war, whereupon, in case of the continuation of the war, the Governments of Germany and of the USSR shall engage in mutual consultations with regard to necessary measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/nazsov/dec939.htm|title=Declaration of the Government of the German Reich and the Government of the USSR of September 28, 1939|publisher=Yale|ref=harv|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126055850/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/nazsov/dec939.htm|archivedate=November 26, 2005|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 3 October, [[Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg]], German ambassador in Moscow, informed [[Joachim Ribbentrop]] that the Soviet government was willing to cede the city of [[Vilnius]] and its environs.

The [[Baltic States]] of [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] were given no choice but to sign a so-called ''Pact of defence and mutual assistance'' which permitted the Soviet Union to station troops in them.&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;

After the [[Baltic states]] were forced to accept treaties,{{Sfn|Engle|Paananen|1985|p=6}} Stalin turned his sights on Finland, confident that Finnish capitulation could be attained without great effort.{{Sfn|Turtola|1999|pp =35–37}} The Soviets demanded territories on the [[Karelian Isthmus]], the islands of the [[Gulf of Finland]] and a military base near the Finnish capital [[Helsinki]],{{Sfn|Turtola|1999|pp=32–33}}{{Sfn|Trotter|2002|pp=12–13}} which Finland rejected.{{Sfn|Edwards|2006|p=55}} The Soviets staged the [[shelling of Mainila]] and used it as a pretext to withdraw from the [[Soviet–Finnish Non-Aggression Pact|non-aggression pact]].{{Sfn|Turtola|1999|pp=44–45}} The [[Winter War|Red Army attacked]] in November 1939.&lt;ref name="ckpipe"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy-Pipe|first=Caroline|title=Stalin's Cold War|place=New York|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1995|isbn=0-7190-4201-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, Stalin set up a puppet government in the [[Finnish Democratic Republic]].{{Sfn|Chubaryan|Shukman|2002|p=xxi}}{{clarify |reason=Chubaryan Shukman 2002 sfn ref missing citation |date=July 2014}} The leader of the Leningrad Military District [[Andrei Zhdanov]] commissioned a celebratory piece from [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], entitled "''[[Suite on Finnish Themes]]''" to be performed as the marching bands of the Red Army would be parading through Helsinki.{{Sfn|Edwards|2006|p=98}} After Finnish defenses surprisingly held out for over three months while inflicting stiff losses on Soviet forces, the Soviets settled for an [[Moscow Peace Treaty|interim peace]].

In mid-June 1940, while international attention focused on the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]], Soviet NKVD troops raided border posts in [[history of Lithuania#First Soviet occupation|Lithuania]], [[Estonia in World War II#Soviet occupation|Estonia]] and [[Latvia#Latvia in World War II|Latvia]].&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn"&gt;{{cite book|last= Senn|first= Alfred Erich|title= Lithuania 1940: Revolution from Above|place= Amsterdam, New York|publisher= Rodopi|year= 2007|isbn= 978-90-420-2225-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, on 26 June, four days after France had sued for an armistice with the Third Reich, the Soviet Union [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum|issued an ultimatum]] demanding [[Bessarabia]] and, unexpectedly, [[Northern Bukovina]] from [[Romania]].{{Sfn|Roberts|2006|p= 55}} Two days later the Romanians acceded to the Soviet demands and the Soviets occupied the territories.

Elimination of Polish elites and intelligentsia was part of [[Generalplan Ost]]. The [[Intelligenzaktion]], a plan to eliminate the Polish intelligentsia, Poland's 'leadership class', took place soon after the [[German invasion of Poland]], lasting from fall of 1939 to the spring of 1940.

Germany also planned to incorporate all land into the [[Third Reich]].{{Sfn|Garlinski|1987|p=28}} This effort resulted in the forced resettlement of 2 million Poles.

In the summer of 1940, fear of the Soviet Union, in conjunction with German support for the territorial demands of Romania's neighbors and the Romanian government's own miscalculations, resulted in more territorial losses for Romania.

On 30 August, Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister [[Galeazzo Ciano]] issued the [[Second Vienna Award]] giving [[Northern Transylvania]] to Hungary. On 7 September, Romania ceded [[Southern Dobruja]] to Bulgaria ([[Axis powers|Axis]]-sponsored [[Treaty of Craiova]]).&lt;ref name="wasserstein305"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wasserstein|first=Bernard|title=Barbarism and Civilization: A History of Europe in Our Time|place=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=0-19-873074-8|page=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After various events in Romania, over the next few months, it increasingly took on the aspect of a German-occupied country.&lt;ref name="wasserstein305"/&gt;

===Early political issues===
The agreement stunned the world. [[John Gunther]], in Moscow in August 1939, recalled that "Nothing more unbelievable could be imagined. Astonishment and skepticism turned quickly to consternation and alarm".&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n159/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers | author=Gunther, John | authorlink=John Gunther | location=New York | year=1940 | pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the pact's announcement, Communists in the West denied that such a treaty would be signed. Future member of the [[Hollywood Ten]] [[Herbert Biberman]] denounced rumors as "Fascist propaganda". [[Earl Browder]], head of the [[Communist Party USA]], stated that "there is as much chance of agreement as of Earl Browder being elected president of the [[United States Chamber of Commerce|Chamber of Commerce]]."&lt;ref name="friedrich1997"&gt;{{cite book|title=City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s|publisher=University of California Press|last=Friedrich|first=Otto|year=1997|edition=reprint|location=Berkeley; Los Angeles|page=24|isbn=0-520-20949-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunther wrote, however, that some knew that "communism and Fascism were more closely allied than was normally understood"; [[Ernst von Weizsäcker]] had told [[Nevile Henderson]] on 16 August that the Soviet Union would "join in sharing in the Polish spoils".{{r|gunther1940}} Beginning in September 1939, the Soviet [[Comintern]] suspended all anti-Nazi and anti-fascist propaganda, explaining that the war in Europe was a matter of capitalist states attacking each other for imperialist purposes.&lt;ref name="cohen110"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Yohanon|title=Small Nations in Times of Crisis and Confrontation|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1989|isbn=0-7914-0018-2|page=110}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Western Communists acted accordingly; while before they supported protecting [[collective security]], now they denounced Britain and France going to war.{{r|friedrich1997}}

When anti-German demonstrations erupted in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]], the Comintern ordered the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Czech Communist Party]] to employ all of its strength to paralyze "chauvinist elements."&lt;ref name="cohen110"/&gt; Moscow soon forced the [[French Communist Party|Communist Parties of France]] and [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Great Britain]] to adopt an anti-war position. On 7 September, Stalin called [[Georgi Dimitrov]],{{Clarify|date=February 2009}}&lt;!--what for?--&gt; and the latter sketched a new Comintern line on the war. The new line—which stated that the war was unjust and imperialist—was approved by the secretariat of the Communist International on 9 September. Thus, the various western Communist parties now had to oppose the war, and to vote against war credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Newint/Redflag.html|title=From the Red Flag to the Union Jack|newspaper=What next journal|place=UK|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the French Communists had unanimously voted in Parliament for war credits on 2 September and on 19 September declared their "unshakeable will" to defend the country, on 27 September the Comintern formally instructed the party to condemn the war as imperialist. By 1 October the French Communists advocated listening to German peace proposals, and Communist leader [[Maurice Thorez]] deserted from the [[French Army]] on 4 October and fled to Russia.{{r|jackson2001}} Other Communists also deserted from the army.

The [[Communist Party of Germany]] featured similar attitudes. In ''Die Welt'', a communist newspaper published in Stockholm{{Efn|Having been banned in Stockholm, it continued to be published in Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://library.fes.de/fulltext/sozmit/som-von-aussen.htm|title=Sozmit|contribution=Som von Außen|place=[[Germany|DE]]|publisher=FES}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} the exiled communist leader [[Walter Ulbricht]] opposed the allies (Britain representing "the most reactionary force in the world"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|place=DE|url=http://library.fes.de/fulltext/sozmit/1940-008.htm|title=Sozialistische Mitteilungen|publisher=FES|issue=8|year=1940|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) and argued: "The German government declared itself ready for friendly relations with the Soviet Union, whereas the English–French war bloc desires a war against the socialist Soviet Union. The Soviet people and the working people of Germany have an interest in preventing the English war plan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Walther|last=Hofer|title=Die Entfesselung des Zweiten Weltkrieges|year=2007|publisher=Lit|isbn=978-3-8258-0383-4|pages=224–5|quote=Die Welt, February 1940.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a warning by the Comintern, German tensions were raised when the Soviets stated in September that they must enter Poland to "protect" their ethnic Ukrainian and Belarusian brethren therein from Germany; Molotov later admitted to German officials that this excuse was necessary because the Kremlin could find no other pretext for the Soviet invasion.{{Sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=128–9}}

During the early months of the pact's operation, the Soviet foreign policy became critical of the Allies and more pro-German in turn. During the fifth session of the Supreme Soviet on 31 October 1939 Molotov analysed the international situation thus giving the direction for Communist propaganda. According to Molotov Germany had a legitimate interest in regaining its position as a great power and the Allies had started an aggressive war in order to maintain the Versailles system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Bianka|editor-last=Pietrow-Ennker|first=Bianka|last=Pietrow-Ennker|contribution=Stalinistische Außen- und Deutschlandpolitik 1939–1941|title=Präventivkrieg?

===Expansion of raw materials and military trading===
{{Main|German–Soviet Credit Agreement (1939)|German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1940)}}
Germany and the Soviet Union entered an [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1940)|intricate trade pact on February 11, 1940]], that was over four times larger than [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|the one the two countries had signed in August 1939]].{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=668–9}} The trade pact helped Germany to surmount a British blockade of Germany.{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=668–9}} In the first year, Germany received one million tons of cereals, half a million tons of wheat, 900,000 tons of oil, 100,000 tons of cotton, 500,000 tons of [[phosphates]] and considerable amounts of other vital raw materials, along with the transit of one million tons of soybeans from [[Manchuria]]. These and other supplies were being transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories.{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=668–9}} The Soviets were to receive a naval cruiser, the plans to the [[German battleship Bismarck|battleship ''Bismarck'']], heavy naval guns, other naval gear and thirty of Germany's latest warplanes, including the [[Bf 109]] and [[Bf 110]] fighters and [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88]] bomber.{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=668–9}} The Soviets would also receive oil and electric equipment, locomotives, turbines, generators, diesel engines, ships, machine tools and samples of German artillery, tanks, explosives, chemical-warfare equipment and other items.{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=668–9}}

The Soviets also helped Germany to avoid British naval blockades by providing a submarine base, [[Basis Nord]], in the northern Soviet Union near [[Murmansk]].&lt;ref name="cohen110" /&gt; This also provided a refueling and maintenance location, and a takeoff point for raids and attacks on shipping.&lt;ref name="cohen110"/&gt; In addition, the Soviets provided Germany with access to the [[Northern Sea Route]] for both cargo ships and raiders (though only the commerce raider {{Ship|German auxiliary cruiser|Komet||2}} used the route before the German invasion), which forced Britain to protect sea lanes in both the Atlantic and the Pacific.{{Sfn|Philbin|1994|pp=130–42}}

===Summer deterioration of relations===
The Finnish and Baltic invasions began a deterioration of relations between the Soviets and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennan|first=George|title=Russian and the West, under Lenin and Stalin|place=NY|publisher=Mentor|year=1961|pages=318–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin's invasions were a severe irritant to Berlin, as the intent to accomplish these was not communicated to the Germans beforehand, and prompted concern that Stalin was seeking to form an anti-German bloc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cartier|first=Raymond|title=Hitler et ses Généreaux|place=Paris|publisher=J'ai Lu/A. Faiard|year=1962|page=233|language=French|trans-title=Hitler and his Generals}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Molotov's reassurances to the Germans, and the Germans' mistrust, intensified. On June 16, as the Soviets invaded Lithuania, but before they had invaded Latvia and Estonia, Ribbentrop instructed his staff "to submit a report as soon as possible as to whether in the Baltic States a tendency to seek support from the Reich can be observed or whether an attempt was made to form a bloc."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-last=Sontag|editor1-first=RJ|editor2-last=Beddie|editor2-first=JS|title=Nazi–Soviet Relations 1939–1941|place=Washington, DC|publisher=State Department|year=1948|page=151|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1940, the Soviet Union briefly suspended its deliveries under [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1940)|their commercial agreement]] after their relations were strained following disagreement over policy in Romania, the [[Winter War|Soviet war with Finland]], Germany falling behind in its deliveries of goods under the pact and with Stalin worried that Hitler's war with the West might end quickly after [[Armistice with France (Second Compiègne)|France signed an armistice]].{{Sfn|Philbin|1994|pp=48, 59}} The suspension created significant resource problems for Germany.{{Sfn|Philbin|1994|pp=48, 59}} By the end of August, relations improved again as the countries had [[Second Vienna Award|redrawn the Hungarian and Romanian borders]], settled some Bulgarian claims and Stalin was again convinced that Germany would face a long war in the west with Britain's improvement in its [[Battle of Britain|air battle with Germany]] and the execution of [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement|an agreement between the United States and Britain regarding destroyers and bases]].{{Sfn|Philbin|1994|p=60}}

In the United States, "The leftists, of course, included the [[Communist Party of the United States of America|Communist Party]], which during the 1939–1941 era of the Nazi-Soviet pact, was slavish in its effort to appease Hitler and sabotage the Allied cause and American preparedness. Their soul mate in Congress was [[Vito Marcantonio]] of New York's [[American Labor Party]]."&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt; Despite opposition from left and right, American aid continued to make a short war unlikely.

However, in late August, Germany arranged its own occupation of Romania, targeting oil fields.{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|p=720}} The move raised tensions with the Soviets, who responded that Germany was supposed to have consulted with the Soviet Union under Article III of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|p=720}}

===German–Soviet Axis talks===

{{Main|German–Soviet Axis talks}}
After Germany in September 1940 entered a [[Tripartite Pact]] with Japan and Italy, Ribbentrop wrote to Stalin, inviting Molotov to Berlin for negotiations aimed to create a 'continental bloc' of Germany, Italy, Japan and the USSR that would oppose Britain and the USA.{{Sfn|Roberts|2006|p=59}} Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to negotiate the terms for the Soviet Union to join the Axis and potentially enjoy the spoils of the pact.{{Sfn|Roberts|2006|p=58}}{{Sfn|Brackman|2001|p=341}} After negotiations during November 1940 on where to extend the USSR's sphere of influence, Hitler broke off talks and continued planning for the eventual attempts to invade the Soviet Union.{{Sfn|Roberts|2006|p=59}}{{Sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202–5}}

===Late relations===

In an effort to demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Germany, on 13 April 1941, the Soviets signed a neutrality pact with Axis power Japan.{{Sfn|Roberts|2006|p=63}} While Stalin had little faith in Japan's commitment to neutrality, he felt that the pact was important for its political symbolism, to reinforce a public affection for Germany.{{Sfn|Roberts|2006|p=66}} Stalin felt that there was a growing split in German circles about whether Germany should initiate a war with the Soviet Union.{{Sfn|Roberts|2006|p=66}} Stalin did not know that Hitler had been secretly discussing an invasion of the Soviet Union since summer 1940,{{Sfn|Ericson|1999|pp=129–30}} and that Hitler had ordered his military in late 1940 to prepare for war in the east regardless of the parties' talks of a potential Soviet entry as a fourth [[Axis Power]].&lt;ref name="weeks74"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=Albert L|title=Stalin's Other War: Soviet Grand Strategy, 1939–1941|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2003|isbn=0-7425-2192-3|pages=74–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Operation Barbarossa}}
Nazi Germany unilaterally terminated the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact at 03:15 on 22 June 1941 by launching a massive attack on the Soviet positions in eastern Poland which marked the beginning of the invasion of the Soviet Union known as [[Operation Barbarossa]].&lt;ref name="stalinswars82"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin had ignored several warnings that Germany was likely to invade,&lt;ref name="stalinswars67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E4D71638F931A25755C0A9639C8B63 |title=Stalin's Intelligence |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |work=Review of books by Murphy, Pleshakov, and Service |date=2005-06-12 |accessdate=2010-03-27 |first=Niall |last=Ferguson |authorlink=Niall Ferguson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|pp=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ordered no 'full-scale' mobilization of forces although the mobilization was ongoing.&lt;ref name="stalinswars69"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the launch of the invasion, the [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|territories gained by the Soviet Union]] as a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact were lost in a matter of weeks. Within six months, the Soviet military had suffered 4.3 million casualties,&lt;ref name="stalinswars116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|pp=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three more million had been captured.&lt;ref name="stalinswars85"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lucrative export of Soviet raw materials to Nazi Germany over the course of the [[Nazi–Soviet economic relations (1934–41)]] continued uninterrupted until the outbreak of hostilities.

===Discovery of the Secret Protocol===
The German original of the secret protocols was presumably destroyed in the bombing of Germany,&lt;ref name="dreifields"/&gt; but in late 1943, Ribbentrop had ordered that the most secret records of the German Foreign Office from 1933 on, amounting to some 9,800 pages, be microfilmed. When the various departments of the Foreign Office in Berlin were evacuated to Thuringia at the end of the war, Karl von Loesch, a civil servant who had worked for the chief interpreter Paul Otto Schmidt, was entrusted with these microfilm copies. He eventually received orders to destroy the secret documents but decided to bury the metal container with the microfilms as a personal insurance for his future well-being. In May 1945, von Loesch approached the British Lt. Col. Robert C. Thomson with the request to transmit a personal letter to Duncan Sandys, Churchill's son-in-law. In the letter, von Loesch revealed that he had knowledge of the documents' whereabouts but expected preferential treatment in return. Colonel Thomson and his American counterpart Ralph Collins agreed to transfer von Loesch to Marburg in the American zone if he would produce the microfilms. The microfilms contained a copy of the Non-Aggression Treaty as well as the Secret Protocol.{{Sfn|Eckert|2012|pp=62–67}} Both documents were discovered as part of the microfilmed records in August 1945 by the State Department employee Wendell B. Blancke, head of a special unit called "Exploitation German Archives" (EGA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=National Archives and Record Administration|title=Record Group 84, POLAD, Classified General Correspondence, 1945–49|id=Box 100. [Archive] Location 350/57/18/02|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty was published in the United States for the first time by the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' on May 22, 1946, in Britain by the ''Manchester Guardian''. It was also part of an official State Department publication, ''Nazi–Soviet Relations 1939–1941'', edited by Raymond J. Sontag and James S. Beddie in January 1948. The decision to publish the key documents on German–Soviet relations, including the treaty and protocol, had been taken already in spring 1947. Sontag and Beddie prepared the collection throughout the summer of 1947. In November 1947, President Truman personally approved the publication but it was held back in view of the Foreign Ministers Conference in London scheduled for December. Since negotiations at that conference did not prove constructive from an American point of view, the document edition was sent to press. The documents made headlines worldwide. State Department officials counted it as a success: "The Soviet Government was caught flat-footed in what was the first effective blow from our side in a clear-cut propaganda war."{{Sfn|Eckert|2012|p=94}}

Despite publication of the recovered copy in western media, for decades, it was the official policy of the Soviet Union to deny the existence of the secret protocol.{{Sfn|Biskupski|Wandycz|2003|p=147}} The secret protocol's existence was officially denied until 1989. [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], one of the signatories, went to his grave categorically rejecting its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8221119.stm|publisher =BBC|work=News|title=Modern views on the Nazi–Soviet pact|date=2009-08-26|accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French Communist Party did not acknowledge the existence of the secret protocol until 1968, as the party [[de-Stalinization|de-Stalinized]].&lt;ref name ="jackson2001"&gt;{{cite book|title=France: The Dark Years, 1940–1944|publisher=Oxford University Press|last =Jackson|first=Julian|year=2001|pages=18, 114–15|isbn=0-19-820706-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August 1986, tens of thousands of demonstrators in 21 western cities including New York, London, Stockholm, Toronto, Seattle, and Perth participated in [[Black Ribbon Day]] Rallies to draw attention to the secret protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enrs.eu/docs/studies.pdf | title=Remembrance and Solidarity.

===Stalin's ''Falsifiers of History'' and Axis negotiations===
In response to the publication of the secret protocols and other secret German–Soviet relations documents in the State Department edition ''Nazi–Soviet Relations'' (1948), Stalin published ''[[Falsifiers of History]]'', which included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's claim to share in a division of the world,&lt;ref name="nekrich202"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; without mentioning the [[German–Soviet Axis talks|Soviet offer to join the Axis]]. That version persisted, without exception, in historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union's dissolution]].&lt;ref name="nekrich202" /&gt;

The book also claimed that the [[Munich agreement]] was a "secret agreement" between Germany and "the west" and a "highly important phase in their policy aimed at goading the Hitlerite aggressors against the Soviet Union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taubert|first=Fritz|title=The Myth of Munich|publisher=Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag|year=2003|isbn=3-486-56673-3|page=318}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henig|first=Ruth Beatrice|title=The Origins of the Second World War, 1933–41|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0-415-33262-1|pages=67–68}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denial of the secret protocol===
For decades, it was the official policy of the Soviet Union to deny the existence of the secret protocol to the Soviet–German Pact. At the behest of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev]] headed a commission investigating the existence of such a protocol. In December 1989, the commission concluded that the protocol had existed and revealed its findings to the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="dreifields"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dreifeilds|first=Juris|title=Latvia in Transition|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|isbn=0-521-55537-X|pages=34–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Congress passed the declaration confirming the existence of the secret protocols, condemning and denouncing them.&lt;ref name="VS1989"&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Law mix|place=[[Russia|RU]]|url=http://www.lawmix.ru/docs_cccp.php?id=1241|script-title=ru:Ведомости Съезда народных депутатов СССР и Верховного Совета СССР|year=1989|id=Ст. 579|type=text of the declaration|issue=29|ref=harv|language=Russian}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Jerzy W|last1=Borejsza|first2=Klaus|last2=Ziemer|first3=Magdalena|last3=Hułas|title=Totalitarian and Authoritarian Regimes in Europe|publisher=Berghahn|year=2006|page=521}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both successor-states of the pact parties have declared the secret protocols to be invalid from the moment they were signed.

In August 2009, in an article written for the Polish newspaper [[Gazeta Wyborcza]], Russian Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] condemned the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact as "immoral."&lt;ref name="bbcbews0809"&gt;{{cite news|title=Putin condemns Nazi–Soviet pact|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8230387.stm|work=|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=31 August 2009|accessdate=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/vladimir-putin/11213255/Vladimir-Putin-says-there-was-nothing-wrong-with-Soviet-Unions-pact-with-Adolf-Hitlers-Nazi-Germany.html|title=Vladimir Putin says there was nothing wrong with Soviet Union's pact with Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany|publisher=Telegraph|date=2014-11-06|accessdate=2014-11-06|author=Tom Parfitt}} "The Russian president made the comments at a meeting with young historians in Moscow, during which he urged them to examine the lead-up to the war, among other subjects." - how does Parfitt know that ? Which young historicans ? Where in Moscow ?&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of such statements the present Russian government and media have to some extent moved back to the Soviet position, again using the term "falsifiers of history". They assert that the invasions of Poland were unconnected to the pact, that the Nazi–Soviet pact was concluded only after fruitless negotiations with Britain and France, and that, by the Munich agreement, Britain and France were at least as culpable for the outbreak of war as the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Lavrov.

===Post-war commentary regarding the motives of Stalin and Hitler===
Some scholars believe that, from the very beginning of the Tripartite negotiations between the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France, it was clear that the Soviet position required the other parties to agree to a Soviet occupation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania,&lt;ref name="Grogin"/&gt; as well as for [[Finland]] to be included in the Soviet sphere of influence.&lt;ref name="Scandinavia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salmon|first=Patrick|title=Scandinavia and the Great Powers 1890–1940|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the timing of German rapprochement, many historians agree that the dismissal of [[Maxim Litvinov]], whose Jewish ethnicity was viewed unfavorably by [[Nazi Germany]], removed an obstacle to negotiations with Germany.{{Sfn|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=109–10}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Israėli︠|first=Viktor Levonovich|title=On the Battlefields of the Cold War: A Soviet Ambassador's Confession|publisher=Penn State Press|year=2003|isbn=0-271-02297-3|page=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=480–1}}{{Sfn|Ulam|1989|p=508}}&lt;ref name="Herf 2006 97–98"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herf|first=Jeffrey|title=The Jewish Enemy: Nazi Propaganda During World War II and the Holocaust|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2006|isbn=0-674-02175-4|pages=97–98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osborn|first=Patrick R|title=[[Operation Pike]]: Britain Versus the Soviet Union, 1939–1941|publisher=Greenwood|year=2000|isbn=0-313-31368-7|page=xix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Nora|title=The Jews in the Soviet Union Since 1917: Paradox of Survival|publisher=NYU Press|year=1988|isbn=0-8147-5051-6|page=330|quote=[Litvinov] was referred to by the German radio as 'Litvinov-Finkelstein' – was dropped in favor of Vyascheslav Molotov.

Stalin had intended: "To be cautious and not allow our country to be drawn into conflicts by warmongers who are accustomed to have others pull the chestnuts out of the fire for them." This was intended to warn the Western powers that they could not necessarily rely upon the support of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flewers|first=Paul|journal=What next|quote=Stalin was publicly making the none-too-subtle implication that some form of deal between the Soviet Union and Germany could not be ruled out.|url=http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Newint/Redflag.html|title=From the Red Flag to the Union Jack: The Rise of Domestic Patriotism in the Communist Party of Great Britain|year=1995|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Likewise, Molotov's appointment served as a signal to Germany that the USSR was open to offers.{{Sfn|Resis|2000|p=51}} The dismissal also signaled to France and Britain the existence of a potential negotiation option with Germany.{{Sfn|Watson|2000|pp=696–8}}{{Sfn|Resis|2000|pp=33–56}} One British official wrote that Litvinov's termination also meant the loss of an admirable technician or shock-absorber, while Molotov's "modus operandi" was "more truly Bolshevik than diplomatic or cosmopolitan."{{Sfn|Watson|2000|p=699}} Carr argued that the Soviet Union's replacement of Foreign Minister Litvinov with Molotov on May 3, 1939 indicated not an irrevocable shift towards alignment with Germany, but rather was Stalin's way of engaging in hard bargaining with the British and the French by appointing a proverbial hard man, namely Molotov, to the Foreign Commissariat.{{sfn|Carr|1979|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PgBsST4r9CQC&amp;pg=PA129 129–30]}} Historian [[Albert Resis]] stated that the Litvinov dismissal gave the Soviets freedom to pursue faster-paced German negotiations, but that they did not abandon British–French talks.{{Sfn|Resis|2000|p=33|ps =: 'By replacing Litvinov with Molotov, Stalin significantly increased his options in foreign policy. Litvinov's dismissal served as a warning to London and Paris that Moscow had a third option-rapprochement with Germany. After Litvinov's dismissal, the pace of Soviet–German contacts quickened. This did not, however, mean that Moscow had abandoned the search for collective security, now exemplified by the Soviet draft triple alliance. Meanwhile, Molotov's appointment served as an additional signal to Berlin that Moscow was open to offers. The signal worked; the warning did not.'}} Derek Watson argued that Molotov could get the best deal with Britain and France because he was not encumbered with the baggage of collective security and could negotiate with Germany.{{Sfn|Watson|2000|pp=695–722|ps =: 'The choice of Molotov reflected not only the appointment of a nationalist and one of Stalin's leading lieutenants, a Russian who was not a Jew and who could negotiate with Nazi Germany, but also someone unencumbered with the baggage of collective security who could obtain the best deal with Britain and France, if they could be forced into an agreement.'}} [[Geoffrey Roberts]] argued that Litvinov's dismissal helped the Soviets with British–French talks, because Litvinov doubted or maybe even opposed such discussions.{{Sfn|Roberts|1992b|pp=639–57|ps =: 'the foreign policy factor in Litvinov's downfall was the desire of Stalin and Molotov to take charge of foreign relations in order to pursue their policy of a triple alliance with Britain and France – a policy whose utility Litvinov doubted and may even have opposed or obstructed.'}}

[[E. H.

Historian Werner Maser stated that "the claim that the Soviet Union was at the time threatened by [[Hitler]], as Stalin supposed&amp;nbsp;... is a legend, to whose creators Stalin himself belonged.{{sfn|Maser|1994|p=64}} In Maser's view, "neither Germany nor Japan were in a situation [of] invading the USSR even with the least perspective {{sic}} of success," and this could not have been unknown to Stalin.{{sfn|Maser|1994|p=42}} Carr further stated that, for a long time, the primary motive of Stalin's sudden change of course was assumed to be the fear of German aggressive intentions.{{Sfn|Carr|1949|pp=3–17}}

In his book ''[[Icebreaker (Suvorov)|Icebreaker]]'' the popular writer [[Viktor Suvorov]], claim that Stalin's primary motive for signing the Soviet–German non-aggression treaty was his calculation that such a pact could result in a conflict between the capitalist countries of Western Europe.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} This idea is supported by Albert L. Weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=Albert L|title=Stalin's Other War: Soviet Grand Strategy, 1939–1941|isbn=0-7425-2191-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|needed=yes|date =August 2013}} Claims by Suvorov that [[Soviet offensive plans controversy|Stalin planned to invade Germany in 1941]] are debated by historians with, for example, [[David Glantz]] opposing such claims, while [[Mikhail Meltyukhov]] supports them.{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} The authors of ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'' consider the pact a [[crime against peace]] and a "conspiracy to conduct [[war of aggression]]."&lt;ref name="black book"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Nicolas|last1=Werth|first2=Karel|last2=Bartošek|first3=Jean-Louis|last3=Panné|first4=Jean-Louis|last4=Margolin|first5=Andrzej|last5=Paczkowski|first6=Stéphane|last6=Courtois|author6-link=Stéphane Courtois|title=[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=1999|edition=hardcover|isbn=0-674-07608-7|page=5}}, 858 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks after [[Soviet occupation of Baltic states|Soviet armies had entered the Baltic states]], Berlin requested Finland to permit the transit of German troops, followed five weeks thereafter by Hitler's issuance of a secret directive "to take up the Russian problem, to think about war preparations," a war whose objective would include establishment of a Baltic confederation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Franz|last=Halder|author-link=Franz Halder|title=Generaloberst Halder.

==Remembrance==
In 2009, the [[European Parliament]] proclaimed 23 August, the anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, as a [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]], to be commemorated with dignity and impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=[[European Parliament]]|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+MOTION+P6-RC-2009-0165+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|type=resolution|title=On European conscience and totalitarianism|date=2 April 2009|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] parliamentary resolution condemned both [[communism]] and [[fascism]] for starting [[World War II]] and called for a day of remembrance for victims of both Stalinism and Nazism on 23 August.&lt;ref name="reuters2009"/&gt; In response to the resolution, the Russian lawmakers threatened the OSCE with "harsh consequences".&lt;ref name="reuters2009"&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia scolds OSCE for equating Hitler and Stalin|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsMaps/idUSTRE5632JI20090704|work=|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=July 4, 2009|accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Resolution on Stalin riles Russia|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8133749.stm|work=|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=20 August 2009|date=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War (1979–1985)|re-ignition of Cold War tensions]] in 1982, the [[U.S. Congress]] during the [[Reagan Administration]] established the [[Baltic Freedom Day]] to be remembered every June 14 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d097:SJ00201:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;;|title=A joint resolution designating "Baltic Freedom Day"|publisher=[[The Library of Congress]]|date=1982-06-09|ref=harv}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Morrison v. Olson''''', 487 U.S. 654 (1988),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Morrison v. Olson|volume=487|page=654|pin=|year=1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a United States federal court case in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decided that the [[Independent Counsel Act]] was constitutional.

==Facts==
The case involved [[subpoenas]] from two subcommittees of the [[United States House of Representatives]] that directed the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to produce documents relating to the efforts of the EPA and the Land and Natural Resources Division of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to enforce the [[Superfund]] law. [[Theodore Olson]] was the [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] for the [[Office of Legal Counsel]]. President [[Ronald Reagan]] ordered the [[Administrator of the EPA]] to withhold the documents on the grounds that they contained "enforcement sensitive information." This led to an investigation by the [[House Judiciary Committee]] that later produced a report suggesting Olson had given false and misleading testimony before a House subcommittee during the investigation.

The Chairman of the Judiciary Committee forwarded a copy of the report to the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] with a request that he seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the allegations against Olson and two others. [[Alexia Morrison]] was named independent counsel and given jurisdiction to investigate whether Olson had violated federal law. Olson moved to quash the subpoenas and sued Morrison in her official capacity.

Olson argued that the [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel|Office of the Independent Counsel]] took executive powers away from the office of the [[President of the United States]] and created a hybrid "[[Fourth branch of government|fourth branch]]" of government that was ultimately answerable to no one. He argued that the broad powers of an independent counsel could be easily abused or corrupted by partisanship. Morrison in turn argued that her position was necessary in order to prevent abuses by the executive branch, which historically operated in a closed environment.

==Holding==
The Court held that the independent counsel provision of the Ethics in Government Act did not violate the principle of [[separation of powers]] because it did not increase the power of one branch at the expense of another. Instead, even though the President cannot directly fire an Independent Counsel, the person holding that office was still an officer of the Executive branch and not under the control of either the [[U.S. Congress]] or the courts.

==Justice Scalia's dissent==
Justice Scalia, the lone dissenter, said that the law should be struck down because (1) criminal prosecution is an exercise of "purely executive power" and (2) the law deprived the president of "exclusive control" of that power.

In his opinion, Scalia also predicted how the law might be abused in practice, writing, "I fear the Court has permanently encumbered the Republic with an institution that will do it great harm."

Conservatives like Senator [[Bob Dole]] began to share his concern when in 1992, four days before the [[United States presidential election, 1992|US presidential election]], [[Lawrence Walsh]] announced the re-indictment of former defense secretary [[Caspar Weinberger]] on charges related to the [[Iran–Contra affair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dole wants investigation of Walsh, others pardoned |date=November 9, 1992 |work=Detroit Free Press |location=Detroit, Michigan |page=5 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20059386/dole_wants_investigation_of_walsh/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics{{Who|date=October 2017}} also sensed partisan politics when Walsh's office leaked a note suggesting President [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] had lied about his connections to the affair.

Concerns were also raised, in line with Scalia's dissent, when independent counsel [[Kenneth Starr]] spent $40 million and more than four years investigating President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]'s land deals and extramarital affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Benjamin |last=Wittes |authorlink=Benjamin Wittes |title=A Kiss of Death for Independent Counsels |date=August 16, 1998 |work=[[The Clarion-Ledger|Clarion-Ledger]] |location=Jackson, Mississippi |page=73 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/20071495/a_kiss_of_death_for_independent_counsels/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many believed the investigation was partisan.

==Aftermath==
Congress let the Independent Counsel Act expire in 1999.

''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "[i]n an introduction he gave shortly after the case was decided, (then) Judge [[Samuel A. Alito|Alito]] said the decision hit the [[separation of powers]] doctrine 'about as hard as heavy-weight champ [[Mike Tyson]] usually hits his opponents.'"&lt;ref name="NYTimes2005"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hulse |first=Carl |author2=Kirkpatrick, David D. |date=December 2, 2005 |title=After Memo, Democrats Are Taking Firmer Stance Against Alito Nomination |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/02/politics/politicsspecial1/02confirm.html |work=The New York Times |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, lawyers for [[I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby]], Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]'s former top aide, argued that Special Counsel [[Patrick J. Fitzgerald]] lacked the legal authority to bring charges against him.&lt;ref name="WashPost2006"&gt;{{cite news |first=Carol D. |last=Leonnig |authorlink= |title=Special Counsel in Plame Case Invalid, Libby Contends |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/23/AR2006022302087_pf.html |work=Washington Post |publisher= |date=February 24, 2006 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2006, a court rejected Libby's argument, citing the precedent in ''Morrison''.&lt;ref&gt;http://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/files/Libby_060427_Fitz_Constitutional.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2013 interview with [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]], Justice Scalia described ''Morrison v. Olson'' as the most wrenching case in which he had participated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Probably the most wrenching was ''Morrison v. Olson'', which involved the independent counsel. To take away the power to prosecute from the president and give it to somebody who’s not under his control is a terrible erosion of presidential power. And it was wrenching not only because it came out wrong—I was the sole dissenter—but because the opinion was written by Rehnquist, who had been head of the Office of Legal Counsel, before me, and who I thought would realize the importance of that power of the president to prosecute. And he not only wrote the opinion; he wrote it in a manner that was more extreme than I think [[William J. Brennan Jr.|Bill Brennan]] would have written it. That was wrenching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Senior |first=Jennifer |date=October 6, 2013 |title=In Conversation: Antonin Scalia |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/antonin-scalia-2013-10/#print |website=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |access-date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Bell Gully Mooting''' is the longest-running [[New Zealand Law Students' Association]] [[moot court]] competition, which is sponsored by Bell Gully. 

The regional rounds of the mooting competition are slightly different at each university, with various levels of faculty involvement depending on the law school.  Most law schools have a long-standing trophy for the winners of their individual competition, such as the Auckland University Stout Shield (named after Sir Robert Stout) and Victoria University of Wellington's Sir Richard Wild Cup.     

The national finals of the mooting competition are held at the NZLSA national conference each year. The winning University from the national finals represents New Zealand at the [[Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2590">An '''obligation''' is a course of action that someone is required to take, whether [[legal obligation|legal]] or [[moral obligation|moral]].  There are also obligations in other normative contexts, such as obligations of [[etiquette]], [[social]] obligations, [[religious]] and possibly in terms of [[politics]], where obligations are requirements which must be fulfilled. These are generally [[legal]] obligations, which can incur a penalty for non-fulfilment, although certain people are obliged to carry out certain actions for other reasons as well, whether as a [[tradition]] or for social reasons.

Obligations vary from person to person: for example, a person holding a political office will generally have far more obligations than an average adult citizen, who themselves will have more obligations than a child.&lt;ref&gt;Old Bear, ''Sacred Journey of the Medicine Wheel'' (2008), p. 393: "Adults have more obligations and are held to higher standards of accountability than children are".&lt;/ref&gt; Obligations are generally granted in return for an increase in an individual's rights or power.  For example, obligations for health and safety in a workplace from employer to employee maybe to ensure the fire exit is not blocked or ensure that the plugs are put in firmly.

The word "obligation" can also designate a written obligation, or such things as bank notes, coins, checks, bonds, stamps, or securities.

==Other uses==
The term obligate can also be used in a biological context, in reference to species which must occupy a certain niche or behave in a certain way in order to survive. In biology, the opposite of obligate is [[facultative]], meaning that a species is able to behave in a certain way and may do so under certain circumstances, but that it can also survive without having to behave this way. For example, species of salamanders in the family [[Proteidae]] are obligate [[paedomorphs]], whereas species belonging to the [[Ambystomatidae]] are facultative paedomorphs.

In the Catholic Church, [[Holy Days of Obligation]] or Holidays of Obligation, less commonly called Feasts of Precept, are the days on which, as canon 1247 of the [[Code of Canon Law]] states, the faithful are obliged to participate in the [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5393">[[File:OHANDA logo.svg|thumbnail| Logo of the Open Hardware and Design Alliance (OHANDA)]]

The '''Open Hardware and Design Alliance''' (OHANDA) aims at encouraging the sharing of open hardware and designs. The core of the project is a free online service where manufacturers of [[Open hardware]] and designs can register their products with a common label. This label maps the four freedoms of [[Free Software]] to physical devices and their documentation. It is similar to a non-registered [[trademark]] for hardware and can be compared to other certificates such as U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) or [[CE mark]]. OHANDA thus has the role of a self-organized registration authority.

== License ==

The Open Hardware and Design Alliance has rewritten the four freedoms of [[free software]] as follows to match them to hardware resp. hardware documentation:

{{Quotation | 
# Freedom 0: The freedom to use the device for any purpose.
# Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the device works and change it to make it to do what you wish. Access to the complete design is precondition to this.
# Freedom 2: Redistribute the device and/or design (remanufacture).
# Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the device and/or design, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits. Access to the complete design is precondition to this.|http://www.ohanda.org}}

The idea to create a label that makes open hardware and designs recognizable is because [[copyright]] and [[copyleft]] are hard to realize in the context of physical devices. Instead of going through the lengthy and expensive process of [[patent]]ing hardware to make it open, hardware developers and designers can put their products under a public domain license by registering them on the OHANDA website. They can license their work under their own names and keep the devices' reuse open.

The procedure is the following: A hardware designer or manufacturer creates an account on the OHANDA website to get a unique producer ID. This account can either be for a person or for an organization. The terms and conditions he accepts to use the label imply that she grants the Four Freedoms to the users. The documentation of the product must be published under a "copyleft" or public domain license. Next, the manufacturer registers the product or design. A unique product ID will be issued. This ID is also referred to as the "OKEY". Now the manufacturer or designer can print or engrave the OHANDA label and the OKEY onto the device. This way, the device always carries the link to the open documentation and to all past contributors. Via the OHANDA website, users can trace back the artefact. At the same time, the label makes the openness of the product visible. Everyone is free to change the device and to share the new design with a new product ID on the website. The development can be seen by following the associations online.&lt;ref&gt;http://opendesignnow.org/index.php/case/ohanda-jurgen-neumann/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The idea of creating a label for open source hardware came up at the GOSH! Summit (Grounding Open Source Hardware) at [[Banff Centre]] in [[Banff, Alberta]] in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.banffcentre.ca/programs/program.aspx?id=888&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the active community members developed the project website&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohanda.org&lt;/ref&gt; where OHANDA-labeled hardware can be registered. OHANDA launched a sticker campaign: The stickers show a crossed out closed box, symbolizing closed "black boxes". The stickers are meant to be put on all sorts of devices to make visible how little open source devices exist.

In 2011, OHANDA community members met at the Piksel11 festival in [[Bergen]]/[[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;http://piksel.no/ocs/index.php/piksel/piksel11/paper/view/777&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, they have been using the term "reables" as a replacement for "Free/Libre Open Source Hardware".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohanda.org/reables&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9858">A '''parish constable''', also known as a '''petty constable''', was a [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] [[Police officer|officer]], usually unpaid and part-time, serving a [[Civil parishes in England|parish]]. The position evolved from the ancient ''[[headborough|chief pledge]]'' of a ''[[tithing]]'', and takes its name from the office of ''[[constable]]'', with which it was originally unconnected.

It is distinct from the more senior position of the hundred-constable, also known as the ''High Constable'' (e.g. ''the High Constable of Holborn'', who was one of the hundred-constables for [[Ossulstone]]; Ossulstone's [[hundred court]] was located at Red Lion Square, in [[Holborn]]).

In London (apart from the [[City of London]]), the position was superseded by the introduction of the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] in 1829, which created a full-time professional force. Elsewhere, professional [[county]] police forces took over, after the [[County Police Act 1839]] was passed.

==History of the position==

=== Origin ===

The office of parish constable originated from the ''[[tithing]]'', a small unit of local administration. Each tithing was obliged, by [[frankpledge]], to be responsible for the actions of its members. The heads of each household would often select one of their number to take charge of the tithing - the ''chief pledge''; in Kent, Sussex, and parts of Surrey, this head man was instead known as a ''[[headborough]]''.

A judicial process - ''[[view of frankpledge]]'' - obliged each tithing to attend the [[shire court]] at regular intervals, and hand over any person in their tithing who the court had summoned; if they did not, and could not swear on oath that they were not involved in helping that person evade justice, the remaining people in the tithing had to pay the damages incurred by the actions of that person. Since this created an incentive for each tithing to enforce standards of behaviour among its own members, the ''chief pledge'' of each tithing was effectively obliged to police behaviour in the tithing.

=== The emergence of constables ===

The term ''constable'' was originally unconnected with the ''chief pledge'', and referred to officers in charge of the [[cavalry]]; it originates from the [[Latin]] ''comes stabuli'', meaning ''count of the stable''. By extension, ''constable'' referred to the officer in command of the army – one of the [[Great Officer of State|Great Officers of State]]. In times of relative peace, this officer was sometimes given a role in keeping order, on account of his command of military resources. Additional ''constables'' were sometimes appointed, if order needed to be kept in multiple places, or the main constable was busy in his main role.

The term ''constable'' consequently began to have a more general meaning related to enforcing order;&lt;ref&gt;p72, Bruce, Alistair, ''Keepers of the Kingdom'' (Cassell, 2002), {{ISBN|0-304-36201-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1285 King [[Edward I of England]] "constituted two constables in every [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]] to prevent defaults in towns and highways".&lt;ref name="fm"&gt;p276-7, Markham, Sir Frank, ''History of Milton Keynes and District'', vol.1 (1973), {{ISBN|0-900804-29-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[England]] and [[Scotland]], the officer in command of the army then came to be called the [[Lord High Constable (disambiguation)|Lord High Constable]], to avoid ambiguity over his role. As the ''chief pledge'' were also involved in policing people's behaviour, though at a much smaller scale, and with much-lowered resources, they gradually came to be referred to as ''petty constables''.

Tithings were originally connected with the hundred, but the [[court baron|courts baron]] introduced by the [[feudal system]], attracted more attention, and the significance of the hundreds decreased. To shift the balance of power away from feudal lords again, [[Justices of the Peace|magistrates]] were introduced, and the kings gradually transferred various functions to them, including from the [[shire court]]s. In 1381, magistrates acquired responsibility for the remains of ''view of frankpledge'', thereby gaining oversight of the activity of ''petty constables''.

The feudal system had gradually been weakened over the [[Middle Ages]], and by the time of the [[Reformation]], the focus of local administration had shifted away from [[manor]]s and towards [[civil parish]]es. Tithings consequently came to be seen as a division of the parish, and so ''petty constables'' became seen as ''parish'' constables; there are records of ''parish'' constables by the 17th century in the county records of [[Buckinghamshire]].

=== Functions of parish constables ===

Parish constables derived most of their powers from their local parish. Traditionally, they were elected by the parishioners (just as the tithing had chosen their ''chief pledge'' forbears), but from 1617 onwards were typically appointed by the magistrates in each county.&lt;ref name="fm"/&gt; It was, however, only in 1842 that the power to appoint constables was formally stripped from manorial courts, and transferred to civil parishes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Although the constables had had to be sworn into their role by the magistrates, magistrates had never formally had the power to actually choose them.

Like many official positions at the time, the position was obligatory, and unpaid, although the chosen constable had the right to employ someone to perform the role on their behalf. It was often a resented burden, as it involved a wide variety of extremely time consuming tasks.

In accordance with the ancient obligation for tithings to present indicted individuals to the courts, each civil parish typically had a small location in which the constable could confine criminals. The constable was responsible not only for confining such people, but also for delivering them to the courts. Similarly, constables were also expected to try and prevent crime within their parish; they were among the people with authority to ''[[Riot Act#Proclamation of riotous assembly|read the Riot Act]]'', and were expected to do so if a riotous assembly arose in their parish.

Vagabonds and beggars could be a drain on parish resources, under the [[Elizabethan Poor Law]]. They could also be a potential source of crime. Constables were expected to implement the [[Vagabonds and Beggars Act 1494]], under which vagabonds and beggars were to be set in the stocks for three days, and then whipped until they leave the parish. The constable also had general responsibility for the local [[stocks]], as well as for the [[pillory]], and was expected to punish poachers, drunks, hedge-damagers, prostitutes, church-avoiders, and fathers of [[Illegitimate child|bastards]].

Just as the tithing was a general administrative unit, and not exclusively limited to policing matters, so the parish constable had functions that would not be recognised as police matters, unlike hundred-constables (which had derived from the military ''constable'').

Parish constables were expected to monitor [[trading standards]] and [[public houses|pubs]], [[Rat-catcher|catch rats]], restrain loose animals, light signal beacons, provide local lodging and transport for the military, perform [[building control]], attend [[inquest]]s, and collect the [[Rates in the United Kingdom|parish rates]]. They were also responsible for collecting national taxes, within their area.

=== Professionalisation ===

The historian Stephen Inwood describes the 4,000 parish constables existing in the early 19th century as "of variable quality and commitment"; some London parishes, such as [[Kensington]], [[Fulham]] and [[Deptford]] (with over 55,000 inhabitants between them at the time of the 1821 census) had no policing at all, and the quality of policing was generally considered inadequate by this period.&lt;ref&gt;p591, Inwood, Stephen, ''A History of London'' (Macmillan, 1998), {{ISBN|0-333-67154-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Metropolitan Police Act 1829]] and [[County Police Act 1839]] gradually led to the end of most unprofessional constabulary. The Metropolitan Police Act established a professional and trained police force, in place of the parish constables, within the bounds of London; the County Police Act allowed [[county|counties]] to do likewise. Each new force was to be headed by a [[chief constable]] (replacing the hundred-constables) who would be appointed by the county magistrates. The wide administrative functions of parish constables were taken over by various recently established local boards (which eventually were re-organised to become local councils).

The voluntary nature of the County Police Act meant that the change proceeded in a piecemeal fashion. The first county to establish a professional force was [[Wiltshire Police|Wiltshire]], which appointed its first chief constable on 28 November 1839;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiltshire.police.uk/history/1839.asp Wiltshire Constabulary History], Wiltshire Police website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Essex]] followed a few months later, appointing its first Chief Constable on 11 February 1840.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essex.police.uk/offbeat/o_mu_25.php The Making of a Chief Constable] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927092346/http://www.essex.police.uk/offbeat/o_mu_25.php |date=September 27, 2007 }}, Essex Police website&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[City of London]] had been exempted from the Metropolitan Police Act, and had to use a [[private act of parliament]] to establish its own professional force as the [[City of London Police]]. 

In [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]], parish constables [[Connétable (Jersey and Guernsey)|still exist as elected parish officers]].

'''''Pierson v. Post''''' is an early American legal case from the [[State of New York]] that later became a foundational case in the field of [[property law]].  The case involved an incident that took place in 1805 at an uninhabited beach near [[Southampton, New York]], on the southeastern coast of [[Long Island]].  Lodowick Post, a local resident, was out in a hunting party when his hunting dogs caught the scent of a fox and began pursuing it.  As they drew near the fox, Jesse Pierson, another local resident, saw the fox{{mdash}}though he denied seeing Post and his party{{mdash}}and promptly killed it and carried it off for himself.  Post filed a lawsuit against Pierson claiming that because had already begun pursuing the fox, the property of the fox's pelt and carcass were rightfully his, not Pierson's.  The local justice ruled in favor of Post. Pierson appealed the ruling to the [[Supreme Court of New York]], who reversed the justice's decision and ruled in favor of Pierson.

''Pierson v. Post'' is generally considered the most famous property law case in American legal history.{{sfnp|Merrill|Smith|2017|p=62}}  Although it only involved a dispute over which of two men deserved ownership of a fox, adjudicating the dispute required determining at what point a wild animal (traditionally known as an animal ''ferae naturae'') becomes "property". The judges chose not to follow [[common law]] precedent on wild animal capture, and since there were no prominent American precedents on the point, the justices in the case were forced to synthesize reasoning from a variety of well-known historical legal treatises—ranging from the ''[[Institutes of Justinian]]'' in the 5th century to the writings of [[Henry de Bracton]] in the 13th century and [[Samuel von Pufendorf]] in the 17th century—into a coherent principle on how property can be first possessed by a human being.{{sfnp|Merrill|Smith|2017|pp=63–64}}  Determining the rightful ownership of the fox involved the essence of the human notion of "property" itself and how it is created, and for this reason ''Pierson v. Post'' is included in nearly all Anglo-American property casebooks.

== Background ==
Lodowick Post, a [[Fox hunting|fox hunter]], was chasing a fox through a [[vacant]] lot on December 10, 1802,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fernandez |first1=Angela |title=The Lost Record of "Pierson v. Post," the Famous Fox Case |journal=Law and History Review |date=2009 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=149–17 8|doi=10.2307/27641649 |jstor=27641649}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Pierson came across the fox and, knowing it was being chased by another, killed the fox and took it away. Post sued Pierson on an action for [[trespass on the case]] for damages against his possession of the fox. Post argued that he had ownership of the fox as giving chase to an animal in the course of hunting it was sufficient to establish possession. The [[trial court]] found in favor of Post.

On appeal after the trial, the issue put to the Supreme Court of Judicature of [[New York (state)|New York]] was whether one could obtain property rights to a [[wild animal]] ([[Ferae naturae]]), in this case the fox, by pursuit. The Supreme Court case was heard by Chief Justice [[James Kent]], then one of the nation's preeminent jurists, and associate justices [[Daniel Tompkins]] (who would later become [[Vice President of the United States]]) and [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] (who would go on to serve as a [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pierson v. Post: Private Property Rights in Wild Animals |url=http://www.nycourts.gov/history/legal-history-new-york/legal-history-eras-02/history-new-york-legal-eras-pierson-post.html |website=New York Courts |accessdate=September 5, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ruling ==

===Majority opinion===
Justice Tomkins wrote the majority opinion.  The Court cited ancient precedent in deciding the case:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If we have recourse to the ancient writers upon general principles of law, the judgment below is obviously erroneous. [[Justinian's Institutes]], and Fleta, adopt the principle, that pursuit alone vests no property or right in the [[Hunting|huntsman]]; and that even pursuit, accompanied with wounding, is equally ineffectual for that purpose, unless the animal be actually taken. The same principle is recognized by [[Bracton]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Puffendorf defines occupancy of [[Animal|beasts]] ''feræ naturæ'', to be the actual corporeal possession of them, and Bynkershoeck is cited as coinciding in this definition. It is indeed with hesitation that Puffendorf affirms that a wild beast mortally wounded, or greatly maimed, cannot be fairly intercepted by another, whilst the pursuit of the person inflicting the wound continues. The foregoing authorities are decisive to show that mere pursuit gave Post no legal right to the fox, but that he became the property of Pierson, who intercepted and killed him.[Citations omitted]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court reasoned that given the common law requirement to have control over one's possessions, merely giving chase was not sufficient. Something more was needed, otherwise law would create a [[slippery slope]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the first seeing, starting, or pursuing such animals, without having so wounded,  circumvented or ensnared the animal, so as to deprive them of their natural [[liberty]], and  subject them to the control of their pursuer, should afford the basis of actions against others  for intercepting and killing them, it would prove a fertile course of quarrels and litigation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The majority opinion found that though it may have been rude for Pierson to have killed the fox, there was no reason to object as only the person to mortally wound or seize the animal can acquire possession of it.

Among the authorities cited by the court in its opinion were the works of [[William Blackstone]], [[Fleta]], [[Jean Barbeyrac]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], [[Hugo Grotius]], and [[Justinian I]].

===Dissent===
Justice Livingston dissented. Livingston was unsatisfied with the authorities cited in the majority opinion. Instead he argued that pursuit should be considered sufficient, as it serves a useful purpose of encouraging [[hunters]] to rid the [[countryside]] of that "wild and noxious beast" known as the fox. Livingston further acknowledged that possession can be seen in relative terms where the continued chase may merely be a formality of the pre-existing control already exerted by the hunter.

Livingston was also of the view that the question in Pierson "should have been submitted to the arbitration of sportsmen".  In such an event, due to local custom, Post likely would have been victorious.  To put it a different way, Livingston believed that if you were to ask local hunters how they felt about pursuit with respect to possession, they would have largely "regarded hot pursuit as giving rights to take an unimpeded first possession".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Epstein |first1=Richard A. |title=Possession as the Root of Title |journal=Georgia Law Review |date=1979 |volume=13 |pages=1221, 1231 |url=http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/journal_articles/1236/ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusion ==
The trial court was reversed so Pierson did not have to pay any damages. As one commenter wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jesse Pierson, son of Capt. David, coming from [[Amagansett]], saw a fox run and hide down an unused [[Water well|well]] near Peters  Pond and killed and took the fox. Lodowick Post  and a company with him were in pursuit and chasing the fox and saw Jesse with it and claimed it as  theirs, while Jesse persisted in his claim. Capt. Pierson said his son Jesse should have the fox and Capt. Post said the same of his son Lodowick and hence the law suit contested and appealed to the highest court in the [[U.S. state|State]] which decided that Post had not got the possession of the fox when Pierson killed it and that he had no property in it as against Pierson until he had reduced it into his own possession. This became 
the leading case often cited because it established; and I think, for the first time, by the court of last resort in the [[U.S. state|State]], that to give an individual right in wild animals, the claimant must capture them. To 
the public the decision was worth its cost. To the parties who each expended over a thousand pounds, the fox cost very dear.

-James T. Adams, Memorials of Old Bridgehampton 166 (1916, 1962)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other hand, Bethany R. Berger notes in "It's Not About the Fox: The Untold Story of ''Pierson v. Post''"&lt;ref&gt;55 Duke L.J. 1089, 1130, 1133 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; that the dispute may have really been about use of the land on which the fox was caught, part of the commons in which Pierson's family, like other descendants of the original settlers of Bridgehampton, had special rights.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14025">A '''possession and acquisition licence''' (PAL) is a firearms licence in [[Gun laws in Canada|Canadian law]]. 

All of the following require a licence in Canada
*Possession of a firearm (including long guns)
*Acquisition of a firearm (including long guns)
*Possession or acquisition of ammunition for a firearm
*Borrowing any of the above (technically possession/acquisition, but can be licensed separately).

A non-resident firearms declaration that has been confirmed by a [[Canada Border Services Agency|customs officer]] is deemed to be a temporary licence for up to 60 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/information/lic-per-eng.htm|title=Licensing|first=Government of Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canadian Firearms|last=Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A non-resident firearms declaration is a specific form that should be reviewed in advance of travel, not an oral statement at the border.

The PAL is the primary licence for possession of a firearm and acquisition of ammunition, and it is both required and the only permissible document for a person to acquire or permanently import a firearm. Applicants must be 18 years of age or more. There is no requirement of citizenship or residency (although different forms, and slightly different requirements apply).

There is a separate licensing system to transport restricted firearms ([[Authorization to Transport|authorization to transport]]). In other words, while a PAL (with appropriate endorsements) may permit a person to purchase a restricted firearm, it does not in itself permit that person to transport it from the store to their home. (This particular case can become an endorsement on a PAL.) For non-restricted firearms separate authorization to transport is not required.

== Other firearms licences ==

Other firearm licences for individuals include:

*Minors licence (under 16) permits borrowing a firearm. Usually applicant must be at least 12, although exceptions can be made if one can demonstrate "need". (Requirements, including courses, are substantially the same as PAL.)
*[[Possession-only licence]]s (POL), which no longer exist. All POLs were converted to PALs. The POL was a grandfathered class of licence that permitted possession of firearms and acquisition of ammunition, but not acquisition of firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/facts-faits/index-eng.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104165438/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/facts-faits/index-eng.htm |archivedate=2011-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Non-resident temporary borrowing licence for non-restricted firearms
*Non-resident temporary possession licence for minors
*Executor of will. While not technically a licence, the executor of a will, in many cases, can temporarily have custody of firearms as part of an estate, without themselves having a firearms licence.
NOTE: While issued licences read either "Possession • Acquisition" or "Possession Only", the Firearms Act and regulations refer to either "possession and acquisition licence" or "possession licence", without the word ''only''.

==Obtaining/Applying==

All licensing of firearms in Canada is managed by the RCMP's Canadian Firearms Program (CFP). In the Canadian system, there are three classes of firearms and firearm licences: non-restricted, restricted and prohibited. See {{slink||Classification of firearms}} below for complete details on prohibited, restricted and non-restricted firearms.

A possession and acquisition licence is a licence that allows individuals in Canada to possess and acquire [[firearms]] as well as [[ammunition]]. Licences are typically valid for five years and must be renewed prior to expiry to maintain all classes. If an individual possessing a PAL is convicted of certain offences, a PAL can be revoked. If an individual does not renew their PAL prior to its expiration date or if they have their PAL revoked, they must legally dispose of any firearms in their possession. A licence for prohibited firearms can be issued to qualifying businesses, and very rarely to individuals (firearms they own, as the gun laws changed over time.) Previous convictions for serious violent, drug or weapons offences almost invariably result in the denial of the application.

A PAL is generally obtained in the following three steps:
;Safety training: All PAL applicants are recommended to successfully complete the Canadian Firearms Safety Course&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/safe_sur/cour-eng.htm|title=Safety Courses|first=Government of Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canadian Firearms|last=Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CFSC) for a Non-restricted licence, and the Canadian Restricted Firearms Safety Course&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/safe_sur/cour-res-eng.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105181345/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/safe_sur/cour-res-eng.htm |archivedate=2011-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (CRFSC) for a restricted licence. In many provinces, however, applicants are also able to challenge the non-restricted and restricted licence examinations without completing the respective safety courses. In most cases, the non-restricted class is a prerequisite to obtain the restricted licence, but both examinations can be challenged at the same time. The examinations contain both a written and practical component. Information on the locations and availability of these courses can be found at the RCMP website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pub.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/safe_sur/cont-eng.htm|title=CFSC and CRFSC Contact Information|first=Government of Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canadian Firearms|last=Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Formal application: Submit completed application (with supporting documents)
;Security screening: Background checks and investigations are performed. All applicants are screened and a mandatory 28-day waiting period is imposed on first-time applicants.

Licences are typically valid for five years and must be renewed prior to expiry to maintain all classes. Once licensed, an individual can apply for a firearm transfer;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/form-formulaire/index-eng.htm#f4|title=Forms|first=Government of Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canadian Firearms|last=Program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an authorization to transport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/form-formulaire/pdfs/679-eng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924085603/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/form-formulaire/pdfs/679-eng.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (ATT) for restricted firearms.

==Classification of firearms==
Like licences, firearms are classified into prohibited, restricted and non-restricted categories, as defined by Part III of ''Criminal Code (R.S., 1985, c. C-46)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/C-46/page-3.html#anchorbo-ga:l_III |title=Criminal Code |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prohibited''' firearms include:
* Handguns with a barrel that is {{convert|105|mm}} or less in length
* Handguns that are designed to discharge .25 or .32 calibre ammunition (unless stated in the ''Regulations Prescribing Exclusions from Certain Definitions of the Criminal Code International Sporting Competition Handguns'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/SOR-98-465/page-2.html |title=Regulations Prescribing Exclusions from Certain Definitions of the Criminal Code (International Sporting Competition Handguns) |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rifles and shotguns that have been altered by sawing, cutting or any other means, so that their barrel length be less than {{convert|457|mm}} or their overall length less than {{convert|660|mm}}
* Automatic firearms, whether or not they have been altered to discharge only one projectile with one pressure of the trigger
* Firearms prescribed as prohibited by the ''Regulations Prescribing Certain Firearms and other Weapons, Components and Parts of Weapons, Accessories, Cartridge Magazines, Ammunition and Projectiles as Prohibited or Restricted (SOR/98-462)'':&lt;ref name="justice1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-462/page-3.html |title=Regulations Prescribing Certain Firearms and other Weapons, Components and Parts of Weapons, Accessories, Cartridge Magazines, Ammunition and Projectiles as Prohibited or Restricted |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Firearm capable of discharging dart or other object carrying electrical current or substance, including [[Taser]] Public Defender and any variant or modified version of it
:* Firearm known as SSS-1 Stinger and any similar firearm designed or of a size to fit in the palm of the hand
:* Hundreds of other firearms listed by name, including any variants or modified versions. The list includes shotguns, carbines, rifles, pistols, and submachine guns.&lt;ref name="justice1"/&gt;

'''Restricted''' firearms are:
* Handguns that are not prohibited
* Semi-automatic firearms with a barrel shorter than 470mm (18.5&amp;nbsp;in)
* Rifles and shotguns that can be fired when their overall length has been reduced by folding, telescoping or other means to less than {{convert|660|mm}}
* Firearms prescribed as restricted by the ''Regulations Prescribing Certain Firearms and other Weapons, Components and Parts of Weapons, Accessories, Cartridge Magazines, Ammunition and Projectiles as Prohibited or Restricted (SOR/98-462),''&lt;ref name="justice1"/&gt; and any variant or modified version of them:
:* High Standard Model 10 Series A &amp; Series B
:* M16 rifle, including Colt AR-15, AR-15 SPI/Sporter/Collapsible Stock Model/A2/A2 Carbine/A2 Government Model Rifle/A2 Government Model Target Rifle/A2 Government Model Carbine/A2 Sporter II/A2 H-BAR/A2 Delta H-BAR/A2 Delta H-Bar Match/9mm Carbine, Armalite AR-15, AAI M15, AP74, EAC J-15, PWA Commando, SGW XM15A and CAR-AR, SWD AR-15, as well as any .22 calibre rimfire variant of it including Mitchell M16A1/22, M16/22, CAR-15/22, AP74 Auto Rifle

'''Non-restricted''' firearms are:
* ordinary rifles and shotguns, other than those referred to above.

==History==
PALs were introduced in Canada in 1995 as part of Bill C-68 as a replacement for the FAC (firearms acquisition certificate) system. Whereas the FAC was only required to acquire a firearm, a PAL is required to both acquire and possess firearms and to acquire ammunition. A PAL for non-restricted firearms allows its holders to acquire and possess any non-restricted firearm, while a PAL for restricted firearms (which also covers prohibited firearms to those eligible) allows the holder to acquire and possess restricted firearms.

When first implemented, the PAL also allowed the holder to acquire a cross-bow, although no licence was required to possess one. There is no longer a licensing requirement for purchasing cross-bows.

==Transportation of firearms==
The transportation regulations are broken down into two divisions: those for non-restricted firearms and those for restricted or prohibited firearms. These rules are laid out in the Storage, Display, Transportation and Handling of Firearms by Individuals Regulations.
A non restricted firearm may be transported so long as it is unloaded.&lt;ref name="laws.justice.gc.ca"&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/SOR-98-209/20100508/page-0.html?rp2=HOME&amp;rp3=SI&amp;rp4=all&amp;rp5=Storage,%20Display,%20Transportation%20and%20Handling%20of%20Firearms%20by%20Individuals%20Regulations&amp;rp9=cr&amp;rp10=L&amp;rp13=50#idhit1 Storage, Display, Transportation and Handling of Firearms by Individuals Regulations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Such a firearm does not need to be encased or [[trigger lock]]ed.

A restricted firearm must be disabled by use of a trigger, cable, or other locking device and locked in an opaque case.&lt;ref name="laws.justice.gc.ca"/&gt;
An unattended non-restricted firearm left in a vehicle must be locked in the trunk or other compartment, if one is available. In order to transport restricted or prohibited firearms, an individual must obtain an [[authorization to transport]]. An ATT is generally approved only for individuals to transport a restricted or prohibited firearm to a shooting range for target practice, gun show for sale, to a gunsmith or gun shop or for a competition (e.g.: IPSC).{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

An [[authorization to carry]] (ATC) allows a person to carry a restricted firearm or prohibited handgun concealed (if specified as a condition of carry) and loaded. An ATC for open carry is usually only issued to employees of armoured car companies or for other limited employment reasons. In very rare situations, an ATC may be issued for protection of life, which would allow the holder to have a loaded handgun with them, or at home, without violating safe storage rules that usually require an unloaded firearm to be trigger locked and secured.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7664">'''Regulation National Market System''' (or '''Reg NMS''') is a US [[financial regulation]] promulgated and described by the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) as "a series of initiatives designed to modernize and strengthen the [[National Market System]] for [[equity securities]]."  The Reg NMS is intended to assure that investors receive the best price executions for their orders by encouraging competition in the marketplace. However, the impact of the rule has been been blamed by some for unintended negative consequences such as the rise of [[high-frequency trading]].&lt;ref name="lewis-excess"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/04/29/memo-to-michael-lewis-the-excesses-of-high-speed-trading-are-a-direct-result-of-sec-micromanagement/#619b98de454e|title=Memo to Michael Lewis|last=Bondi|first=Bradley|date=April 29, 2014|work=Forbes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Established in 2005, its aim was to foster both "competition among individual markets and competition among individual orders"&lt;ref&gt;SEC Release No. 34-51808 s. I.B.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to promote efficient and fair price formation across securities markets.

In 1972, before the SEC began its pursuit of a national market system, the market for securities was quite fragmented.  The same stock sometimes traded at different prices at different trading venues, and the [[NYSE]] ticker tape did not report transactions of NYSE-listed stocks that took place on regional exchanges or on other over-the-counter securities markets.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Seligman, Rethinking Securities Markets, The Business Lawyer, Vol. 57, Feb. 2002, p.641&lt;/ref&gt; This fragmentation made it difficult for traders to comparison shop. In 1975, Congress passed the [[Securities Acts Amendments of 1975]], authorizing the SEC to facilitate a national market system.

==Consolidation of rules==
In 2005, the rules promoting the national market system were consolidated into REG NMS.  Some of the more notable rules include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/34-50870.htm |title=Regulation NMS - Proposed rules and amendments to joint industry plans |publisher=US Securities and Exchange Commission |date=November 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Access Rule - addresses access to market data such as quotations (Rule 610)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.610 |title=CFR 242.610 - Access to quotations |date=June 29, 2005 |publisher=Cornell Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Order Protection (or Trade Through) Rule - provides intermarket price priority for quotations that are immediately and automatically accessible (Rule 611)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.611 |title=CFR 242.611 - Order protection rule |date=June 29, 2005 |publisher=Cornell Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sub-Penny Rule - establishes minimum pricing increments (Rule 612)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/242.612 |title=CFR 242.612 - Minimum pricing increment |date=June 29, 2005 
 |publisher=Cornell Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Market Data Rules:
**a) Allocation amendment – institutes a new Market Data Revenue Allocation Formula,
**b) Governance amendment – creates advisory committees,
**c) Distribution and Display Rules – governing market data (Rule 600, 601 &amp; 603).

==Impact==
Reg NMS has been described as a shift away from the SEC's historical role of defining and then enforcing general duties and obligations of market participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/04/29/memo-to-michael-lewis-the-excesses-of-high-speed-trading-are-a-direct-result-of-sec-micromanagement/#619b98de454e|title=Memo to Michael Lewis|last=Bondi|first=Bradley|date=April 28, 2014|work=Forbes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Reg NMS dictates the specifics of how the market should execute trades. This "micromanagement" of complicated market mechanics has been blamed for unintended consequences, including the rise of [[high-frequency trading]].&lt;ref name="lewis-excess"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Reg NMS, a section called the order protection rule has further been controversial because it requires traders to transact on a trading venue at the lowest price rather than on a venue offering the quickest execution or the most reliability, which can result in a worse overall price for institutional orders after execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/finance/324538-its-time-for-the-sec-to-take-a-hard-look-at-this-stock-market-rule |title=It's time for the SEC to take a hard look at this stock market rule |date=March 17, 2017 |author=Donald Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the order protection rule has been blamed for exacerbating market fragmentation, resulting in rising technology and exchange costs for market makers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ft.com/content/ac12e7b0-14c9-11e7-80f4-13e067d5072c &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/04/29/memo-to-michael-lewis-the-excesses-of-high-speed-trading-are-a-direct-result-of-sec-micromanagement/#aa8d189454ea|title=Memo to Michael Lewis|last=Bondi|first=Bradley|date=April 29, 2014|work=Forbes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some have described it as an improper government intervention into private business affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Hans R. Stoll, Electronic Trading in Stock Markets, Journal of Economic Perspectives Vol. 20, No. 1, p.171&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of the rule argue that it really just requires what brokers should be doing if they are acting in their customer's best interests.&lt;ref name="Hans R. Stoll p.172"&gt;Hans R. Stoll, Electronic Trading in Stock Markets, Journal of Economic Perspectives Vol. 20, No. 1, p.172&lt;/ref&gt;  Still others have argued that the rule is too lax because it only protects the quotes at the top of the book.&lt;ref name="Hans R. Stoll p.172" /&gt;  For example, if the best two quotes in one market are superior to the best quote in another market, a portion of an incoming [[market order]] may still trade at the inferior market at the inferior price even though the second best quote on the superior market is still available.  If more than just the top of the book (the best quote) were protected by the order rule, the market order would have transacted at a superior price and the limit order offering the superior price would have transacted more quickly.

{{Admiralty law}}
The "'''Rotterdam Rules'''" (formally, the '''United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea''') is a treaty proposing new international rules to revise the legal framework for [[affreightment|maritime affreightment]] and [[Ship transport|carriage of goods by sea]]. The Rules primarily address the legal relationship between carriers and cargo-owners. As of October 2015, the Rules are not yet in force as they have been ratified by only three states.

The aim of the convention is to extend and modernize existing international rules and achieve uniformity of [[International trade law]] in the field of [[admiralty law|maritime]] carriage, updating or replacing many provisions in the [[Hague Rules]], [[Hague-Visby Rules]] and [[Hamburg Rules]].&lt;ref name=un/&gt;&lt;ref name=rotterdam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rotterdamrules2009.com/cms/index.php?page=general-information|title=Rotterdam Rules Signature Ceremony|author=Susan Husselman|work=Rotterdam Rules 2009 Secretariat|publisher=Rotterdam Rules 2009|accessdate=16 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention establishes a comprehensive, uniform legal regime governing the rights and obligations of [[Shipment|shippers]], [[Common carrier|carriers]] and [[consignee]]s under a contract for [[door-to-door]] shipments that involve international sea transport.&lt;ref name=un&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/transport_goods/2008rotterdam_rules.html|title=2008 – United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea – the 'Rotterdam Rules'|work=U.N. Commission on International Trade Law|publisher=UNCITRAL.org|accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Hague Rules of 1924 were updated in 1968 to become the Hague-Visby Rules, but the changes were modest. The modified convention still covered only "tackle to tackle" carriage contracts,  with no provision for multimodal transport. The industry-changing phenomenon of [[containerization]] was barely acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby Rules: Article IV Rule 5c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jus.uio.no/lm/sea.carriage.hague.visby.rules.1968/doc.html#31 ''Hague-Visby Rules'']&lt;/ref&gt; The 1978 Hamburg Rules were introduced to provide a framework that was both more modern, and less biased in favour of ship operators. Although the Hamburg Rules were readily adopted by developing countries, the new convention was shunned by richer countries who stuck with Hague and  Hague-Visby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacksonparton.com ''The Jackson Parton Miscellany'']&lt;/ref&gt; It had been expected that a Hague/Hamburg compromise might arise, but instead the vast (96 articles) Rotterdam Rules appeared.

The final draft of the Rotterdam Rules, which was assembled by the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]], was adopted by the United Nations on 11 December 2008, and a signing ceremony was held in [[Rotterdam]] on 23 September 2009.&lt;ref name=rotterdam/&gt;&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{Citation|title=United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea|url=http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/transport/rotterdam_rules/09-85608_Ebook.pdf|year=2008|publisher=U.N.

Headquarters]] in New York City, United States.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

The [[World Shipping Council]] is a prominent supporter of the Rotterdam Rules. In 2010, the American Bar Association House of Delegates approved a resolution supporting U.S. ratification of the Rotterdam Rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joc.com/maritime/bar-association-endorses-rotterdam-rules ''Maritime Bar Association Endorses Rotterdam Rules'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/international_law/2010/09/rotterdam-rules.html ''Law Professors Address International Law'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main provisions==
The following are critical provisions and law changes found in the Rotterdam Rules:
* The Rules apply only if the carriage includes a sea leg; other multimodal carriage contracts which have no sea leg are outside of the scope of the Rules.
* It extends the period that carriers are responsible for goods, to cover the time between the point where the goods are received to the point where the goods are delivered.&lt;ref name=dynamic&gt;{{cite news|title=UN shipping convention ready for Australia|author=Adeline Teoh|newspaper=Dynamic Export|date=16 November 2009|url=http://www.dynamicexport.com.au/news/un-shipping-convention-ready-for-australia00799/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It allows for more [[e-commerce]] and approves more forms of electronic documentation.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It increases the limit liability of carriers to 875 units of account per shipping unit or three units of account per kilogram of gross weight.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It eliminates the "nautical fault defence" which had protected carriers and crew from liability for [[negligent]] ship management and navigation.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It extends the time that legal claims can be filed to two years following the day the goods were delivered or should have been delivered.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It allows parties to so-called "Volume Contracts" to [[opt-out]] of some liability rules set in the convention.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It obliges carriers to keep ships seaworthy and properly crewed throughout the voyage.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt; The standard of care is not "strict", but "due diligence" (as with the Hague Rules).

==Entry into force and ratifications==
The Rotterdam Rules will enter into effect a year after 20 countries have ratified that treaty.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"&gt;[http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/transport_goods/rotterdam_status.html ''U.N. Transport Treaty'']&lt;/ref&gt; As of 9 August 2011, there were 24 signatories to the treaty.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"/&gt; The most recent country to sign the treaty was Sweden, which signed on 20 July 2011.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"/&gt; Spain was the first country to ratify the convention in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2011/unisl149.html ''U.N. Press Release 2011'']&lt;/ref&gt; An overview of signatures and ratifications is shown below:

Upon entry into force of the convention for a country, it should denounce the conventions governing the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] as well as the [[Hamburg Rules]] as the convention does not come into effect without such denouncements.

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}

The phrase "'''separate peace'''" refers to a nation's agreement to cease military hostilities with another, even though the former country had previously entered into a [[military alliance]] with other states that remain at [[war]] with the latter country.  For example, at the start of [[World War I]] (1914–1918), [[Russian Empire|Russia]] was a member, with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[French Second Republic|France]], of the [[Triple Entente]], which went to war with the [[Central Powers]] formed by [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]].  After the fall of Russian monarch [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and the rise to power of the [[Bolshevik]]s, Russia defaulted on its commitments to the Triple Entente by signing [[Armistice between Russia and the Central Powers|a separate peace with Germany and its allies]] in 1917.  This armistice was followed on 3 March 1918 by the formal signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].

==Legal obligations not to conclude separate peace==
It is customary in cases of war waged by several allies to conclude agreement or declaration by all belligerents on the same side not to conclude a separate peace with the opposing camp. An example of such an undertaking was included in the alliance treaty concluded between the [[Papal States]], the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] and the [[Republic of Venice]], concluded in Rome on Oct. 19, 1463. The parties undertook to launch a crusade against the Turks and to refrain from making peace with the Sultan without the consent of all three parties.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Pastor, ''History of the Popes'', vol. 3, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the case during the [[First World War]] and [[Second World War]].

A declaration to that effect was issued on September 5, 1914 by the British, French and Russian governments, which briefly stated 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The British, French, and Russian Governments mutually engage not to conclude peace separately during the present war. The three Governments agree that when terms of peace come to be discussed, no one of the allies will demand conditions of peace without the previous agreement of each of the other allies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/tripleentente_noseppeace.htm Declaration of Sept. 5, 1914], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2212043?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Declaration of the Triple Entente]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Japanese government acceded to this declaration on October 19, 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1915/9 Japanese note of accession] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927034343/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1915/9 |date=2012-09-27 }}, [http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/fullnames/pdf/1915/TS0009%20(1915)%20CD-8014%201915%2019%20OCT,%20LONDON%3B%20NOTES%20RESPECTING%20ACCESSION%20OF%20JAPAN%20TO%20DECLARATION%20ENGAGING%20NOT%20TO%20CONCLUDE%20PEACE%20SEPARATELY.pdf Accesssion of Japan to the Declaration between United Kingdom, France and Russia].&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 1915, the same four governments, now joined by the Italian government, issued a similar joint declaration regarding avoiding separate peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1915/14 Declaration of November 30, 1915] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927034356/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1915/14 |date=September 27, 2012 }}, [http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/fullnames/pdf/1915/TS0014%20(1915)%20CD-8107%201915%2030%20NOV,%20LONDON%3B%20DECLARATION%20BETWEEN%20UK,%20FRANCE,%20ITALY,%20JAPAN,%20&amp;%20RUSSIA%20ENGAGING%20NOT%20TO%20CONCLUDE%20PEACE.pdf Declaration between the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan and Russia engaging not to conclude peace separately during the present war]&lt;/ref&gt;

The obligation to refrain from separate peace was also made during the Second World War in both camps. The Tripartite Pact between the German, Italian and Japanese governments committed the three to prosecute the war together. On the Allied camp, that obligation was contained in the United Nations Declaration of January 1, 1942.

A similar obligation arose within the Arab League in the context of the Arab-Israeli conflict not to reach any separate peace treaty with the Israeli government, in order to assure that a collective arrangement would take into consideration the interests of all Arab states plus the Palestinians. The Egyptian government under [[Anwar Sadat]] acted in contrast to that rule when it decided to conclude a [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|separate peace treaty]] in 1979.

[[File:1897 Pattern IOS 1.jpg|thumb|[[1897 pattern British infantry officer's sword]], regulation sword for officers of the line infantry of the British Army since 1897.]]
The usage of '''swords in courts-martial''' was an established tradition within the British armed forces. The accused was marched into their [[court-martial]] by an escort armed with a sword. [[Commissioned officers]] would be obliged to put their swords on the court table as a symbol of their rank and reputation being put on hold.&lt;ref name=tele /&gt; At the conclusion of the hearing, the tip of the sword was turned towards them if they had been found guilty. The practice was abolished in 2004 following a claim that it was demeaning under the [[Human Rights Act 1998]].&lt;ref name=sword&gt;{{cite book | first =Mark | last =Barton  | title =British Naval Swords and Swordmanship | publisher = Seaforth Publishers | edition =   | year = 2013 | isbn =184832135X| pages = 23-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==
Traditionally in British courts-martial, all court officials would wear swords as well as all officers, whether they were a witness or were acting for the defence or prosecution. All accused, regardless of rank, would be marched into the courtroom by an armed escort. Officers' escorts would carry a drawn sword. If the accused was not an officer, the escort would carry a drawn [[cutlass]].&lt;ref name=sword /&gt; The accused officer would then have to lay his sword lengthwise on the court table as a symbol of putting his officer's commission and reputation on hold and on the line.&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite web|last=Foggo |first=Daniel |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1370385/Navy-up-in-arms-over-challenge-to-sword-protocol.html |title=Navy up in arms over challenge to sword protocol |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2000-10-15 |accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the verdict was decided, the judge would move the sword. If the tip of the sword pointed towards the accused, it meant they had been found guilty. If the sword was either unmoved or the hilt of the sword was pointing towards the accused then he had been found not guilty.&lt;ref name=sword /&gt;

== Abolition in the UK ==
In 2000, two weeks after the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] came into force, a court martial was challenged that all swords should be removed from court as it was claimed to be "degrading". The [[Judge Advocate]] at the trial agreed for all present to remove their swords but did so under [[common law]] practice, describing them as an "unnecessary encumbrance".&lt;ref name=tele /&gt; The [[European Court of Human Rights]] case of ''Grieves v United Kingdom'', which concerned the independence of members of courts martial, referred to the use of swords but this was not part of the issues for determination by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/app/conversion/pdf/?library=ECHR&amp;id=001-61550&amp;filename=001-61550.pdf |title=''Grieves v. the United Kingdom'' |publisher=Council of Europe |date= |accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 [[Her Majesty's Government]] declared that it would no longer require the accused to be marched in with an armed escort nor would any members present wear sheathed swords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/2004/mar/22/courts-martial |title=Courts Martial |work=Hansard |date=2004-03-22 |accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came after Grieves' solicitor had written to the [[Secretary of State for Defence]] comparing the procedure to a "[[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera" and threatened to go back to the European Court for a ruling on swords for being intimidating.&lt;ref name=sword /&gt;

The [[Royal Australian Navy]] retains the practice of the sword on the table at courts-martial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navalofficer.com.au/swords11/ |title=Naval Swords |publisher=Navalofficer.com.au |date=2009-08-11 |accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does the [[Indian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =R.G. | last =Vidhu  | title =Court Martial Process: Empirically Studied | publisher = Vij Books India Pvt Ltd | edition =   | year = 2011 | isbn =9382573461| page = 200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To put things into proper perspective, in [[1991 Major League Baseball season|1991]], the second year of the league's contract with the network, CBS reported a loss of around $169 million in the third quarter of the year. A decline in advertiser interest caused revenue from the sale of commercials during CBS's baseball telecasts to plummet.

As part of MLB's attempt to produce and market the games in-house, it hoped to provide games of regional interests to appropriate markets.

Owners also hoped that this particular technique, combined with the additional division races created through league expansion (the [[Colorado Rockies]] and [[Florida Marlins]] had begun play the year prior) and the quest for wild card spots for the playoffs ([[1994 Major League Baseball season|1994]] was the first year of three divisions for each league) would increase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wise and Meyer|first=Aaron N. and Bruce S.|date= |title=International Sports Law and Business, Volume 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oSix-O4CmvMC&amp;pg=PA1701&amp;lpg=PA1701&amp;dq=the+baseball+network+cbs+major+league+baseball+1994&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4LPhUOnH9I&amp;sig=EWr4SKGx7BQkCIpPJ92mgaxmRv8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DNHqVK2KB8bloASDhYHoDg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20baseball%20network%20cbs%20major%20league%20baseball%201994&amp;f=false|location= |publisher= |page=1701|isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the national broadcast revenue for Major League Baseball in the foreseeable future.

Prior to this, Major League Baseball was projected to take a projected 55% cut in rights fees and receive a typical rights fee from the networks. When compared to the previous TV deal with CBS, The Baseball Network was supposed to bring in 50% less of the broadcasting revenue.

Arranging broadcasts through The Baseball Network seemed, on the surface, to benefit NBC and ABC (who each contributed $10 million in start-up funds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shaprio|first=Leonard|date=September 18, 1993|title=Untangling Baseball Network's Intricacies|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19930918&amp;id=lgocAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YXsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6968,2958950&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) since it gave them a [[monopoly]] on broadcasting Major League Baseball games. The deal was similar to a [[Brokered programming|time-buy]], instead of a traditional rights fee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball on Disney?

It also stood to benefit the networks because they reduced the risk associated with purchasing the broadcast rights outright (in stark contrast to CBS's disastrous contract with Major League Baseball from the 1990–1993 seasons). NBC and ABC were to create a loss-free environment for each other and keep an emerging [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which had recently made an aggressive and ultimately successful $1.58 billion bid for the [[NFL on television|television rights]] for [[National Football Conference]] games (thus, becoming a major player in the sports broadcasting game in the process), at bay. As a result of Fox's NFL gain, CBS was weakened further by [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliate changes]], as a number of stations jumped to Fox from CBS (for example, in [[Detroit]], [[WWJ-TV]] replaced [[WJBK]]).

==Coverage==
The Baseball Network kicked off its coverage on July 12, 1994 on [[NBC]] with the [[1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] from [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABCs (and NBCs) of TBN's MLB plan|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED3D4C4865105C1&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|author=Barry Horn|newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|date=July 6, 1994|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NBC broadcast team consisted of [[Bob Costas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=1994 All-Star Game Open|id=2v3pmoh8fLY}}&lt;/ref&gt; on play-by-play, with [[Joe Morgan]] and [[Bob Uecker]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=October 15, 1995|title=SIGNOFF;World Series, as Told by Bob Uecker|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/tv/signoff-world-series-as-told-by-bob-uecker.html|work=New York Times|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as analysts. Costas, a veteran presence at NBC, had been the network's secondary baseball play-by-play announcer behind [[Vin Scully]] during the 1980s. Morgan, who was also working for [[ESPN]] at the time, had spent two years at NBC in the mid-1980s and two years at ABC from 1988-1989. Uecker, the longtime voice of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], returned to national television for the first time since he worked for ABC in the 1970s and early 1980s.

[[Greg Gumbel]] hosted the pre game show; this was one of his first assignments for NBC after having left [[CBS Sports]] following the [[1994 College World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greg Gumbel Finds Saying Farewell Can Be Painful|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-06-10/sports/9406100238_1_david-kenin-gary-fencik-cbs-sports|author=Steve Nidetz|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 10, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Helping with interviews were [[Hannah Storm]] and [[Johnny Bench]]. The 1994 All-Star Game reportedly sold out all its advertising slots. This was considered an impressive financial accomplishment, given that one 30-second spot cost US$300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Opening Day a New Wrinkle TV Coverage|url=http://alb.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&amp;imageid=5715674|author=John Nelson|newspaper=[[Florida Times-Union]]|date=April 3, 1994|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABC, meanwhile, was able to have its primary broadcast team from 1989 return intact. [[Al Michaels]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sandomir|first=Richard|date=July 7, 1995|title=TV SPORTS; Demise of a Network Opens Baseball Format|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/07/sports/tv-sports-demise-of-a-network-opens-baseball-format.html|work=The New York Times|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; served as the play-by-play announcer once again. [[Tim McCarver]], who had just spent four years at CBS, returned as an analyst along with [[Jim Palmer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tyson Fight Takes a Big Wad to See|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=FW&amp;s_site=fortwayne&amp;p_multi=FW&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB6CD0EEE9C8FAF&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|newspaper=[[Fort Wayne News-Sentinel]]|date=August 18, 1995|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the subject of Michaels returning to baseball for the first time since the infamous [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] interrupted the [[1989 World Series]], Jim Palmer said, "Here Al is, having done five games since [[1989 Major League Baseball season|1989]], and steps right in.

More specifically, on regional Saturday night broadcasts and all non-"national" broadcasts, TBN let the two lead announcers from the opposing teams call the games involving their teams together.

Games involving either of the two Canadian-based MLB teams at the time, the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[Montreal Expos]], were not always included in the ''Baseball Night in America'' package. Canadian rightsholders were allowed to broadcast the games. When [[Major League Baseball on TSN|TSN]] (which owned the cable rights to the Blue Jays and Expos) covered the games in Canada, they re-broadcast the ''BNIA'' feed across their network. Typically, if the Blue Jays were idle for the day, the Expos would be featured on TSN. Also, [[CBET-DT|CBET]] (the [[CBC Television|CBC]] affiliate in [[Windsor, Ontario]]) would air Blue Jays games if the [[Detroit Tigers]] were not playing at home that night or if the Blue Jays scheduled to play in Detroit. Whether or not the game would air in the opposing team's market would depend on which time zone they were from, or if they shared a market with another team.

Ratings for both seasons of the ''Baseball Night in America'' regular season coverage were substantially higher than [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS]]'s final season in 1993 (3.8) or any subsequent season on [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]]. ''Baseball Night in America'' earned a 6.2 during the [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] [[1994 in baseball|1994 season]] and a 5.8 in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball's Back on TV, But Will Fans Tune In or Turn Off? |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1995/Baseball-s-Back-on-TV-But-Will-Fans-Tune-In-or-Turn-Off-/id-43e1ee849169871f2e40b6a953f921f6|author=John Nelson|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=April 20, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When ABC and NBC last covered baseball together from 1976 to 1989, ABC had the rights to the World Series in odd-numbered years while NBC would cover the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series in said years. Likewise, this process would alternate in even numbered years, with ABC getting the All-Star Game and both LCS in years that NBC had the World Series.

The networks also promised not to begin any World Series weekend broadcasts after 7:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's A Whole, New Ballgame |url=http://articles.philly.com/1993-10-29/sports/25934892_1_abc-and-nbc-ken-schanzer-league-championship-series|author=Bill Fleischman|newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=October 29, 1993|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When CBS held the television rights, postseason games routinely aired on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] at 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. at the earliest. This meant that [[Joe Carter]]'s dramatic [[1993 World Series|World Series]] clinching home run in 1993 occurred after midnight in the East. As CBS' baseball coverage progressed, the network dropped the 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. pregame coverage (in favor of airing [[sitcom]]s such as ''[[Evening Shade]]'') before finally starting its coverage at 8:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time. The first pitch would generally arrive at approximately 8:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.

ABC won the rights to the first dibs at the World Series in August 1993 after [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] president Dennis Swanson won a coin toss&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC Wins Coin Toss for Game 7|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/orlandosentinel/access/77931900.html?dids=77931900:77931900&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+13%2C+1995&amp;author=&amp;pub=Orlando+Sentinel&amp;desc=ABC+WINS+COIN+TOSS+FOR+GAME+7&amp;pqatl=google|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=September 13, 1995|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC flips for Game 7 of Series|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-09-13/sports/1995256119_1_baseball-network-telecast-game-7|author=Milton Kent|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=September 15, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; by calling "heads."

Schanzer agreed to the coin toss by ABC and NBC at the outset as the means of determining the order in which they would divide up the playoffs.

What separated The Baseball Network from previous television deals with Major League Baseball, and was by far the most controversial part of the deal, was that not all postseason games (aside from the World Series) were guaranteed to be shown nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Television / Analysis -- Who's On TV?

===Criticisms===
A major problem with ''Baseball Night in America''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Andriesen|first=David|date=20 July 1994|title=New TV deal a shame for baseball fans|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=860&amp;dat=19940720&amp;id=-TJPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M48DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6842,1957825&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the idea that viewers could not watch "important" games. Marty Noble put it in perspective by saying "With the ''Network'' determining when games will begin and which games are made available to which [[media market|TV markets]], Major League Baseball can conduct parts of its pennant races in relative secrecy." What added to the troubles of The Baseball Network was the fact that ''Baseball Night in America'' held exclusivity over every market. This most severely impacted markets with two teams, specifically New York City&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MEDIA More Pain for Fans|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/20169916.html?dids=20169916:20169916&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+29%2C+1995&amp;author=Steve+Zipay&amp;pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&amp;desc=MEDIA+More+Pain+for+Fans&amp;pqatl=google|author=Steve Zipay|newspaper=Newsday Systems Corporation|date=September 29, 1995|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[New York Mets|Mets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Swing And A Miss Baseball's Attempt To Juice Up The Game May Leave A Sour Taste Come Playoff Time|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/08/07/205257/swing-and-a-miss-baseballs-attempt-to-juice-up-the-game-may-leave-a-sour-taste-come-playoff-time|website=Sports Illustrated|date=August 7, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New York Yankees|Yankees]]), the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]] ([[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] and [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Angels]]), [[Chicago]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cubs Viewers Thrown a Curve by TBN Blackout|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/21100960.html?dids=21100960:21100960&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+23%2C+1995&amp;author=Steve+Nidetz%2C+Tribune+Media+Columnist&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=CUBS+VIEWERS+THROWN+A+CURVE+BY+TBN+BLACKOUT&amp;pqatl=google|author=Steve Nidetz|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 23, 1995|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]] and [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]]), the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] ([[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] and [[Oakland Athletics|A's]]), and even [[Texas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=`Baseball Night' leaves Astros, Rangers fans on deck|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&amp;p_theme=aasb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAD97A220C872EA&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|date=July 14, 1995|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Houston Astros|Astros]] and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Rangers]]). For example, if ''Baseball Night in America'' showed a Yankees game, this meant that nobody in New York could see that night's Mets game and vice versa.

Things got so bad for The Baseball Network that even local broadcasters objected to its operations. [[KSMO-TV]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], the primary over-the-air station for the [[Kansas City Royals]], went as far as to sue the Royals for breach of contract resulting from their broadcasts being "overexposed" and violating its territorial exclusivity. Worse yet, even if a market had only one team, the ABC or NBC affiliate could still not broadcast that team's game if the start time was not appropriate for the time zone. For example, if the [[Detroit Tigers]] (the only team in their market) played a road game in [[Kingdome|Seattle]], [[Overstock.com Coliseum|Oakland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cashing in, hand over fist|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/21342196.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+22%2C+1995&amp;author=Jack+Craig%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Cashing+in%2C+hand+over+fist&amp;pqatl=google|author=Jack Craig|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=August 22, 1995|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim|Anaheim]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball Network strikes out again for Oriole fans|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-08-25/sports/1995237112_1_baseball-network-orioles-nbc|author=Milton Kent|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=August 25, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Pacific Time (a late game), Detroit's Baseball Network affiliate (either [[WXYZ-TV]] or [[WDIV-TV|WDIV]], depending on the network which held the rights to the game) could not air the game because the start time was too late for the Detroit area (11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tickets Available for Nomo's Start|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB4D2329C4CCCC8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|newspaper=[[Miami Herald]]|date=July 15, 1995|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Detroit viewers only had the option of viewing the early game of the night.

''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' columnist [[Tom Verducci]] for one, was very harsh on The Baseball Network, dubbing it both "America's regional pastime" and an "abomination." ABC Sports president Dennis Swanson,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=24 June 1995|title=The Baseball Network says it'll abandon baseball|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19950624&amp;id=EUhWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GusDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6847,5969439&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in announcing the dissolution of The Baseball Network, said "The fact of the matter is, Major League Baseball seems incapable at this point in time, of living with any long term relationships, whether it's with fans, with players, with the political community in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], with the advertising community here in [[Manhattan]], or with its TV partners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Swing And A Miss|url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&amp;title=Baseball%27s+attempt+to+juice+up+the+game+may+leave+a+sour+-+08.07.95+-+SI+Vault&amp;expire=&amp;urlID=432446172&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1006913%2Findex.htm&amp;partnerID=289881|author=[[Tom Verducci]]|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=August 7, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the start of the strike, [[Stanford University]]'s Roger Noll&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TV SPORTS; The Baseball Network Says the Players' Analyst Struck Out |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/26/sports/tv-sports-the-baseball-network-says-the-players-analyst-struck-out.html|author=Richard Sandomir|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 26, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the Baseball Network deal (and the bargain-basement [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]] cable renewal, which went from $100 million to $42 million because of their losses) reflected "poor business judgment on the part of management about the long-run attractiveness of their product to national broadcasters." He added that the $140 million that owners expected to share for the 1994 season (before the strike) from TBN was underestimated by "one-third to one-half" and fell below the annual average of $165 million needed to renew the TBN deal after two years. Meanwhile, Andy Zimbalist, author of ''Baseball and Billions'', and a [[Major League Baseball Players Association|players' union]] consulting economist, insisted that baseball could have done better than the TBN deal with some combination of [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS]] (which offered $120 million last-ditch bid for renewal), [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] and [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]]. Baseball shut out CBS and could have waited longer before closing them out."

Five years after The Baseball Network dissolved, [[NBC Sports]] [[play-by-play]] announcer Bob Costas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Later Costas' Not-so-sad Farewell To Baseball|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1995-06-25/sports/17963434_1_baseball-network-bob-costas-league-championship-series|author=Bob Raissman|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=June 25, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in his book ''Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Costas|first=Bob|date=2001|title=Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vz09JodkPo8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Fair+Ball:+A+Fan%27s+Case+for+Baseball&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LUVYVevZJcyjyASL3IGYCA&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Baseball%20Network&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=Crown/Archetype|page=28|isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that The Baseball Network was "stupid and an abomination." Costas further wrote that the agreement involving the World Series being the only instance of The Baseball Network broadcasting a nationally televised game was an unprecedented surrender of prestige, as well as a slap to all serious fans. He believed that The Baseball Network fundamentally corrupted the game and acknowledged that the most impassioned fans in baseball were now prevented&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tbn TV's Baseball Nonsense|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1995/oct/05/tbn-tvs-baseball-nonsense/|author=Mike Bruton|newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=October 5, 1995|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from watching many of the playoff games that they wanted to see, as all playoff games had been broadcast nationally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nidetz|first=Steve|date=October 6, 1995|title=Baseball Network's Success In Dulling-down Playoffs Causes Its Demise|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-10-06/sports/9510060080_1_baseball-network-yankee-haters-tbn|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for decades. Costas added that both the divisional series and the League Championship Series now merited scarcely higher priority than regional coverage provided for a [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] [[college football|football]] game between [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|Wisconsin]] and [[University of Michigan|Michigan]].

According to [[Curt Smith (author)|Curt Smith]]'s book, ''The Voice – Mel Allen's Untold Story'', the longtime [[New York Yankees]] broadcaster and ''[[This Week in Baseball]]'' [[Mel Allen|host]] was quoted as saying "You wonder how anything would be worse [than CBS].

During the 1995 Division Series, the fan frustration with The Baseball Network was so bad that the mere mention of it during the [[1995 Seattle Mariners season|Mariners]]–[[1995 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] [[1995 American League Division Series|ALDS]] from public address announcer [[Tom Hutyler]] at [[Seattle]]'s [[Kingdome]] brought boos from most of the crowd.

==Downfall and demise==
The long-term plans for The Baseball Network began to crumble after players and owners [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|went on strike]] on August 12, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McNamara Vaults Into Festival Coverage|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB4223624B807AD&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|author=Tracey Labovitz|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=July 16, 1995|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jones|first=Tom|date=10 August 1994|title=For television, a baseball strike would be no big deal|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=368&amp;dat=19940810&amp;id=LrY0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mT8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3735,2291829&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Walker County Messenger|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the cancellation of [[1994 World Series|that year's World Series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=There's Always Next Year-Maybe Baseball Advertisers Take a Hike for '94|url=http://adage.com/article/news/year-baseball-advertisers-a-hike-94/90015/|author=Jeff Jensen|newspaper=Advertising Age|date=September 19, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABC was denied its remaining ''Baseball Night in America'' telecasts and NBC was shut out of its game broadcast slate (which in 1994, was scheduled to begin on August 26&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=KRON/NBC commercials, 6/22/1994 part 19|id=HqdZ_hLEzuU}}&lt;/ref&gt;) altogether.

The Baseball Network's contract stipulated that negotiations could only take place with NBC and ABC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC blocks baseball play for deal|url=https://variety.com/1995/tv/features/abc-blocks-baseball-play-for-deal-99129456/|author=Gary Levin|newspaper=Variety|date=July 24, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; for 45 days, starting on August 15, 1995.

CBS and Fox were also rumored to share rights to the postseason. In the end however, CBS's involvement did not come to pass and NBC became Fox's over-the-air national television partner. Whereas each team earned about $14 million in 1990 under CBS the later TV agreement with NBC and Fox beginning in 1996 earned each team about $6.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title=Sports: A Reference Guide and Critical Commentary, 1980–1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=192V884VTWIC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=Major+League+Baseball+on+CBS&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-O7LUanJD8HwiwLt64DoCw&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Major%20League%20Baseball%20on%20CBS&amp;f=false|author=Donald L.

To salvage the remains of the partnership, ABC and NBC elected to share coverage&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=ESPN Sports Reporters with Dick Schaap - October 20, 1995 from Fulton County Stadium|id=AhhTi4yIoDA&amp;t=665s}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the 1995 postseason&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The World Series may come down to Kenny Lofton vs. Deion Sanders|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1995/PM-BBO-Postseason-TV/id-dcf842fbd021dcbcd0aed088eac0e86a|author=Ben Walker|agency=Associated Press|date=July 21, 1995|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the World Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abc, Nbc To Share World Series Coverage|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-07-21/sports/9507210351_1_turner-sports-baseball-network-nbc-spokesman|author=Steve Nidetz|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=July 21, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enjoy It While You Can; Free Boxing Won't Last|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AS&amp;p_theme=as&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F78FB0E0DFB6A2F&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|author=Beth Bragg|newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]]|date=September 15, 1995|accessdate=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; wound up broadcasting Games 1, 4, and 5 of 1995 World Series&lt;ref name="TBNTales"/&gt; while NBC would broadcast Games 2,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=1995 NBC Promo (Game 2 -- World Series).wmv|id=Uczr4D3Tlhg}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=MLB World Series 24.10.1995 Cleveland Indians VS Atlanta Braves (Game 3)|id=cGosHR89i6w}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 6&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|title=1995 WS Intro|id=Puyrx0wTz_o}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which turned out to be the decisive game). Had the 1995 World Series gone to a seventh game, it would have then been broadcast by ABC. As it stands, Game 5 of the 1995 World Series is to date, the final Major League Baseball game to be broadcast on ABC.

Others would argue that a primary reason for its failure was its abandoning of localized markets in favor of more lucrative and stable advertising contracts afforded by turning to a national model of broadcasting, similar to the [[NFL on television|National Football League's television package]], which focuses on localized games, with one or two "national" games.

===Aftermath===
In the end, the venture would lose US$95 million in advertising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TV SPORTS; Baseball Network Faces a Full Count|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/20/sports/tv-sports-baseball-network-faces-a-full-count.html|author=Richard Sandomir|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 20, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly $500 million in national and local spending. The Baseball Network generated only about $5.5 million per team in revenue for each of the two years that it operated. To put things into proper perspective, in 1993 alone, CBS generated about $14.7 million per team. Much of this could possibly be traced back to the strike causing a huge drop in revenue, which in return caused baseball salaries to decrease by approximately $140,000 on average in 1995.

Both ABC and NBC soon publicly vowed to cut all ties with Major League Baseball for the remainder of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Abc, Nbc Pull Plug On Baseball |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-06-24/news/9506240075_1_postseason-coverage-baseball-owners-abc-sports|author=Leonard Shapiro|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 24, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball Broadcasting Faces Uncertain Future|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/baseball-broadcasting-faces-uncertain-future/337690.html|newspaper=[[The Moscow Times]]|date=June 28, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC, NBC Quit Baseball Network : Television: Rights probably will be offered to CBS or Fox after this season.|author=Steve Nidetz|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-06-23/sports/sp-16313_1_baseball-network|agency=Associated Press|date=June 23, 1995|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed on to be the exclusive network carrier of [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Major League Baseball regular season games]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BASEBALL; ABC Issues Warning to Turner and Fox|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/13/sports/baseball-abc-issues-warning-to-turner-and-fox.html?pagewanted=print|author=Richard Sandomir|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 13, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, NBC kept a postseason-only (with the exception of even-numbered years when NBC had the rights to the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]) deal in the end, signing a deal to carry three Division Series games, one half of the [[League Championship Series]] (the [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]] in even numbered years and the [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]] in odd numbered years; Fox would televise the other LCS in said years), and the [[1997 World Series|1997]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gaffney|first=Jim|date=19 October 1997|title=Bob Costas finally takes his World Series cuts|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=19971019&amp;id=9z9UAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OY4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4148,1255583&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Boca Raton News|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[1999 World Series]] respectively (Fox had exclusive rights to the [[1996 World Series|1996]], [[1998 World Series|1998]] and [[2000 World Series]]).

ESPN's Major League Baseball contract was not affected then, but would take a hit in [[1998 NFL season|1998]] with the new National Football League contract.

In 2012, Fox would revive the ''Baseball Night in America'' title (previously used for The Baseball Network's games) for a series of Saturday night games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FOX Hearkens Back to The Baseball Network With ‘Baseball Night in America’|url=http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/2012/04/fox-hearkens-back-to-the-baseball-network-with-baseball-night-in-america/|work=Sports Media Watch|date=April 10, 2012|accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike The Baseball Network, Fox did not carry every game that was scheduled for a given Saturday, only choosing five to six games to distribute to its affiliates.

As far as the primary announce teams for The Baseball Network were concerned, they mostly went their separate ways. Al Michaels remained at ABC until 2006 (his final assignment for ABC Sports was [[Super Bowl XL]]), when he moved to NBC to become the voice of their [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday night NFL coverage]]. Tim McCarver joined Fox as its primary analyst alongside [[Joe Buck]] and stayed there until his retirement from national TV broadcasts in [[2013 World Series|2013]]. Jim Palmer, meanwhile, would rejoin the Orioles as [[List of Baltimore Orioles broadcasters|their television analyst]], where he still remains. 

NBC's primary crew remained in place for two more years. Bob Uecker would leave following the [[1997 World Series]], but Bob Costas and Joe Morgan would continue calling games until NBC's contract expired following the [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000 season]]. The network's final game to date was Game 6 of the [[2000 American League Championship Series]]. Costas has since become the lead broadcaster for [[MLB Network]] (as previously alluded towards, MLB Network's self-produced, live ''[[MLB Network Showcase|MLB Showcase]]'' telecasts could be seen as a [[spiritual successor]] to The Baseball Network's broadcasts), while Morgan kept working for ESPN until the end of the [[2010 Major League Baseball season|2010 season]].

It should also be noted that on July 8, 2011, the top two play-by-play men for The Baseball Network (who called the World Series for their respective networks 16 years prior), Al Michaels and Bob Costas teamed up (with the two announcers alternating between play-by-play and color commentary) to call a game between the [[2011 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] and [[2011 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] on MLB Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fangsbites.com/2011/06/al-michaels-bob-costas-to-call-game-for-mlb-network-in-july/ |title=Al Michaels &amp; Bob Costas To Call Game For MLB Network in July |author=Fang, Ken |date=June 29, 2011 |work=Fangsbites.com |publisher=Wordpress |accessdate=July 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704072147/http://fangsbites.com/2011/06/al-michaels-bob-costas-to-call-game-for-mlb-network-in-july/ |archivedate=July 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Michaels' first appearance as a primary announcer on a baseball telecast since Game 5 of the [[1995 World Series]] on [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]].

Michaels and Costas also made appearances on [[SportsNet New York]] and [[Comcast SportsNet Bay Area]] during the game's middle innings, since the MLB Network broadcast was [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blacked out]] in the Mets' and Giants' respective home markets.

The British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, [[Anthony Eden]], was in transit to Moscow at the time, so Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was in charge of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]]. The text of his letter to the Japanese Ambassador was as follows:

{{quote|Sir,
On the evening of December 7th His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom learned that Japanese forces without previous warning either in the form of a declaration of war or of an ultimatum with a conditional declaration of war had attempted a landing on the coast of Malaya and bombed Singapore and Hong Kong.''

In view of these wanton acts of unprovoked aggression committed in flagrant violation of International Law and particularly of Article I of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Third Hague Convention]] relative to the opening of hostilities, to which both Japan and the United Kingdom are parties, His Majesty's Ambassador at Tokyo has been instructed to inform the Imperial Japanese Government in the name of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom that a state of war exists between our two countries.''

I have the honour to be, with high consideration,
::Sir,
::Your obedient servant,
::Winston S. Churchill&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1941/dec/08/prime-ministers-declaration#column_1358 Official Report, House of Commons, 8 December 1941, 5th series, vol. 376, cols 1358–1359]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of the letter, Churchill later wrote: "Some people did not like this ceremonial style. But after all when you have to kill a man it costs nothing to be polite."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yVQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=when+you+have+to+kill+a+man+it+costs+nothing+to+be+polite&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HCCXT7u9G4jN4QTHyP1G&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=when%20you%20have%20to%20kill%20a%20man%20it%20costs%20nothing%20to%20be%20polite&amp;f=false LIFE magazine 27 sep 1954] says this is in ''[[The Second World War (book series)|The Second World War]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United States [[ex rel]]. Gerald Mayo v. Satan and His Staff''''', 54 [[F.R.D.]] 282 ([[United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania|W.D.Pa]]. 1971),&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States ex rel. Gerald Mayo v. Satan and His Staff|United States ex rel. Gerald Mayo v. Satan and His Staff, 54 F.R.D. 282 (1971)]]&lt;/ref&gt; was a federal [[court case]] in which a [[prisoner]] filed a [[lawsuit]] against [[Satan]] and his servants in United States District Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite |url=http://failuremag.com/article/devils-advocate |title=Devil’s Advocate: Can Satan be held legally responsible for his actions? |author=Jason Zasky |publisher=Failure Magazine |date=Mar 13, 2007 |accessdate=Dec 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dismissed on [[civil procedure|procedural grounds]].

== Prisoner's Rights Laws ==
The rights of inmates while behind bars. All inmates are protected by the Eighth Amendment from cruel and unusual punishment. The definition of cruel and unusual punishment is not clear. A violation of a person's dignity could be considered cruel and unusual. Prisoners are entitled to medical care and treatment.

==The complaint==
Gerald Mayo, a 22 year old inmate at [[State Correctional Institution – Pittsburgh|Western Penitentiary]] in Pittsburgh,&lt;ref name=news&gt;{{web cite |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/huntingdon-daily-news-dec-07-1971-p-2/ |title=A federal judge has refused to order Satan to quit |publisher=Huntingdon Daily News, ocr, pg 2 |date=December 7, 1971 |quote=PITTSBURGH. A federal judge has refused to order Satan to quit placing temptations before a 22 year old inmate at Western Penitentiary who claimed the Devil caused his downfall. The devil with it all, said US District Court Judge Gerald J. Weber on Monday when he threw the case out of court because federal marshals could not produce the devil. Gerald Mayo of Reading, Pa, filed the petition for the injunction against Satan and his staff, and argued Satan violated his constitutional rights by placing irresistible obstacles in his path. Weber said the nearest thing he could find to a precedent was Stephen Vincent Benet’s short story 'The Devil and Daniel Webster' where Webster contended Satan was a foreign prince and could not sue in America courts. Although he did not go that far, Weber said Mayo failed to show Satan lives within the court’s jurisdiction and that federal marshals were not told how Satan could be summoned.}}&lt;/ref&gt; filed a claim before the [[United States district court|United States District Court]] for the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania|Western District]] of [[Pennsylvania]] in which Mayo alleged that "[[Satan]] has on numerous occasions caused plaintiff misery and unwarranted threats, against the will of plaintiff, that Satan has placed deliberate obstacles in his path and has caused plaintiff's downfall" and had therefore "deprived him of his constitutional rights," allegedly prohibited under several sections of the [[United States Code]]. Mayo filed ''[[in forma pauperis]]'' - that is, he asserted that he would not be able to afford the costs associated with his lawsuit and that they therefore should be waived. Mayo filed a law suit against Satan and his minions, not the prison system.  Mayo filed suit against external forces that the prison had no control over. 

==The decision==
In his decision,&lt;ref name=news/&gt; U.S. District Court Judge [[Gerald Joseph Weber|Gerald J. Weber]] first noted that the [[jurisdiction]]al situation was unclear. While no previous cases had been brought by or against Satan and so no official precedent existed, there was an "unofficial account of a trial in [[New Hampshire]] where this defendant filed an action of mortgage foreclosure as plaintiff", a reference to the short story "[[The Devil and Daniel Webster]]". Judge Weber suggested that the Devil (who had claimed in that story to be an American), should he appear, might have been therefore [[Estoppel|estopped]] from arguing a lack of personal jurisdiction.  In this context, the Court noted that Satan was a [[foreign prince]], but did not have occasion to address whether, if sued as a defendant, he would be able to claim [[sovereign immunity]] from suit.

Judge Weber noted that three of the four requirements for a [[class action]] suit were met (commonality [there are questions of law or fact common to the class], numerosity [the class is so large that individual suits is impractical], and typicality [claims of each class member are typical of the claims of the class]). However, class action status was not granted because the judge was unable to determine whether Mayo would adequately represent the class (the adequacy element).

Finally, the judge noted that Mayo had failed to provide directions to the [[United States Marshals Service]] as to [[service of process]].

Citing the foregoing reasons, the court refused the request to proceed ''in forma pauperis''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://loweringthebar.net/case-law-hall-of-fame/mayo|title=United States ex rel. Mayo v. Satan and His Staff|last=|first=|date=2015-10-05|work=Lowering the Bar|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Court doubted the need for action due to the complaint containing no allegation of residence in plaintiff.

The '''Universal Copyright Convention''' ('''UCC'''), adopted in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, in 1952, is one of the two principal international conventions protecting [[copyright]]; the other is the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]].

The UCC was developed by [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) as an alternative to the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] for those states which disagreed with aspects of the Berne Convention, but still wished to participate in some form of multilateral copyright protection. These states included developing countries as well as the United States and most of [[Latin America]]. The former thought that the strong copyright protections granted by the Berne Convention overly benefited Western, developed, copyright-exporting nations, whereas the latter two were already members of the [[Buenos Aires Convention]], a Pan-American copyright convention that was weaker than the Berne Convention. The Berne Convention states also became party to the UCC, so that their copyrights would exist in non-Berne convention states. In 1973, the [[Soviet Union]] joined the UCC.

The United States only provided copyright protection for a fixed, renewable term, and required that in order for a work to be copyrighted it must contain a copyright notice and be registered at the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]]. The Berne Convention, on the other hand, provided for copyright protection for a single term based on the life of the [[author]], and did not require registration or the inclusion of a copyright notice for copyright to exist. Thus the United States would have to make several major modifications to [[United States copyright law|its copyright law]] in order to become a party to it.  At the time the United States was unwilling to do so. The UCC thus permits those states which had a system of protection similar to the United States for fixed terms at the time of signature to retain them. Eventually the United States became willing to participate in the Berne convention, and change its national copyright law as required. In 1989 it became a party to the Berne Convention as a result of the [[Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988]].

Under the Second Protocol of the Universal Copyright Convention (Paris text), protection under U.S. copyright law is expressly required for works published by the [[United Nations]], by UN specialized agencies and by the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/17C1.txt House Report No. 94-1476] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831012931/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/17C1.txt |date=2006-08-31 }} in connection with Title 17, [[United States Code]], Section 104&lt;/ref&gt; The same requirement applies to other contracting states as well.

Berne Convention states were concerned that the existence of the UCC would encourage parties to the Berne Convention to leave that convention and adopt the UCC instead. So the UCC included a clause stating that parties which were also Berne Convention parties need not apply the provisions of the Convention to any former Berne Convention state which renounced the Berne Convention after 1951. Thus any state which adopts the Berne Convention is penalised if it then decides to renounce it and use the UCC protections instead, since its copyrights might no longer exist in Berne Convention states.

Since almost all countries are either members or aspiring members of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and are thus conforming to the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] Agreement (TRIPS), the UCC has lost significance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2366">'''Wage regulation''' refers to attempts by a government to regulate wages paid to citizens.

==Minimum wage==
{{main|Minimum wage}}
Minimum wage regulation attempts to set an hourly, or other periodic monetary standard for pay at work. A recent example was the U.K. [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998]]. Germany is currently debating whether to introduce its own.

==Collective bargaining==
{{main|Collective bargaining}}
Collective agreements between [[trade unions]] and employers can regulate wages of workers according to the needs of the business.

==Arbitration==
{{main|Arbitration}}
{{seealso|Australian labour law}}
Arbitration involves makes collective agreements between trade unions and employers legally binding and mediated through a state appointed judge or magistrate.

==Economic labour theory==
{{main|Labour economics}}
An economic analysis of the law holds very simply that any intervention in a contract between two parties creates an inefficient labour market. Wages kept artificially high, by imposing any administrative or monetary costs on employers distorts the labour market equilibrium. For a national economy in a globalised world, that means jobs will go overseas and the [[unemployment rate]] rises. Major proponents of this sort of labour economics include Nobel Prize winner from the University of Chicago, Professor [[Gary Becker]]. Professor Becker keeps a blog with well-known academic and judge, [[Richard Posner]]. Posner is a lawyer and economist, and wrote a book called ''Economic Analysis of Law''. His starting assumption is that unions are the cartelisation of the labour market. Both would agree, that if its aim is to improve the living standards of society, wage regulation defeats itself. Posner says, “Economics is not a theory about consciousness. Behaviour is rational when it conforms to the model of rational choice, whatever the state of mind of the chooser.”&lt;ref&gt;Posner, Richard, (1998) ''Economic Analysis of Law'', 5th Edition, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; So any conscious attempt to improve working standards are impossible under this view.
