'''Arthur Coleman Danto''' (January 1, 1924 – October 25, 2013) was an American [[art critic]] and  philosopher. He is best known for having been an influential, long-time art critic for ''[[The Nation]]'' and for his work in philosophical [[aesthetics]] and [[philosophy of history]], though he contributed significantly to a number of fields, including the philosophy of action. His interests included thought, feeling, [[philosophy of art]], theories of [[Representation (arts)|representation]], [[Theoretical psychology|philosophical psychology]], [[Hegel]]'s aesthetics, and the philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].

==Background and education==
Danto was born in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], January 1, 1924, and grew up in [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name="Times obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/arts/design/arthur-c-danto-a-philosopher-of-art-is-dead-at-89.html?_r=0|last=Johnson|first=Ken|authorlink=Ken Johnson (art critic)|date=October 27, 2013|title=Arthur C. Danto, a Philosopher of Art, Is Dead at 89|work=The New York Times|accessdate=28 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in a [[Reform Jewish]] home.&lt;ref name="Times of Israel obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/groundbreaking-art-critic-arthur-danto-dies-at-89/|last=Italie|first=Hillel|date=October 28, 2013|title=Groundbreaking art critic Arthur Danto dies at 89|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending two years in the Army, Danto studied art and history at Wayne University (now [[Wayne State University]]) and then pursued graduate study in philosophy at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="Times obituary"/&gt; From 1949 to 1950, Danto studied in Paris on a [[Fulbright scholarship]] under [[Jean Wahl]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nakedpunch.com/articles/88 Arthur Danto - Interviewed by Zoe Sutherland]. ''[[Naked Punch]]'', 10 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1951 returned to teach at Columbia.&lt;ref name="Times obituary"/&gt; In 1992 he was named Johnsonian Professor Emeritus of Philosophy.&lt;ref name="Times obituary"/&gt;  He was twice awarded fellowships from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] and was a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

==Thought==
Arthur Danto argues that "a problem is not a philosophical problem unless it is possible to imagine that its solution will consist in showing how appearance has been taken for reality."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Danto, ''Connections to the World: The Basic Concepts of Philosophy'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1989), p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;  While science deals with empirical problems, philosophy according to Danto examines indiscernible differences that lie outside of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Carroll, "Danto's Comic Vision: Philosophical Method and Literary Style," ''Philosophy and Literature'' 39.2 (October 2015), p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt;

Danto "believes that persons are essentially systems of representation."&lt;ref&gt;Noel Carroll, "Danto's Comic Vision: Philosophical Method and Literary Style," ''Philosophy and Literature'' 39.2 (October 2015), p. 563 n. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Artworld" and the definition of art===
Danto laid the groundwork for an institutional definition of art&lt;ref&gt;This theory has been described as an "influential theory about the nature of art", according to [http://philosophynow.org/issues/99/News_November_December_2013 Philosophy Now, November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; that sought to answer the questions raised by the emerging phenomenon of twentieth-century art. The definition of the term “art” is a subject of constant contention and many books and journal articles have been published arguing over the answer to the question "[[Aesthetics|What is Art?]]" Definitions can be categorized into conventional and non-conventional definitions. Non-conventional definitions take a concept like the aesthetic as an intrinsic characteristic in order to account for the phenomena of art. Conventional definitions reject this connection to aesthetic, formal, or expressive properties as essential to defining art but rather, in either an institutional or historical sense, say that “art” is basically a sociological category. In terms of [[classificatory disputes about art]], Danto takes a conventional approach. His "institutional definition of art" considers whatever art schools, museums, and artists get away with, regardless of formal definitions. Danto has written on this subject in several of his recent works and a detailed treatment is to be found in ''Transfiguration of the Commonplace''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Danto | first = Arthur | authorlink = Arthur Danto | coauthors = | title = The transfiguration of the commonplace: a philosophy of art | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 1981 | location = | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LIW60mm5QJkC&amp;dq=transfiguration+of+the+commonplace| doi = | isbn = 978-0-674-90346-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay "The Artworld" in which Danto coined the term “artworld”, by which he meant cultural context or “an atmosphere of art theory,”&lt;ref name="The Definition of Art"&gt;Adajian, Thomas. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/art-definition/ "The Definition of Art"], ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', London, Oct 23, 2007. &lt;!--accessed December 21, 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; first appeared in the ''Journal of Philosophy''  (1964) and has since been widely reprinted. It has had considerable influence on aesthetic philosophy and, according to professor of philosophy [[Stephen David Ross]], "especially upon [[George Dickie (philosopher)|George Dickie's]] [[institutional theory of art]]. Dickie defines an art work as an artifact 'which has had conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting in behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld)' (p. 43.)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ross | first = Stephen David | authorlink = Stephen David Ross | coauthors = | title = Art and its Significance | publisher = SUNY Press | year = 1984 | location = | pages = 469 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vDdZNwTmEqUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=danto&amp;f=false | doi = | isbn = 0-87395-764-4 }} Note: Ross also refers us to Dickie's book ''Art and the Aesthetic'' (Cornell University Press, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "Danto's definition has been glossed as follows: something is a work of art if and only if (i) it has a subject (ii) about which it projects some attitude or point of view (has a style) (iii) by means of rhetorical ellipsis (usually metaphorical) which ellipsis engages audience participation in filling in what is missing, and (iv) where the work in question and the interpretations thereof require an art historical context. (Danto, Carroll) Clause (iv) is what makes the definition institutionalist. The view has been criticized for entailing that art criticism written in a highly rhetorical style is art, lacking but requiring an independent account of what makes a context art historical, and for not applying to music."&lt;ref name="The Definition of Art"/&gt;

===The end of art===
The basic meaning of the term "art" has changed several times over the centuries and continued to evolve during the 20th century as well. Danto describes the history of Art in his own contemporary version of [[Hegel|Hegel's]] dialectical history of art. "Danto is not claiming that no-one is making art anymore; nor is he claiming that no good art is being made any more. But he thinks that a certain history of western art has come to an end, in about the way that Hegel suggested it would."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rowan.edu/open/philosop/clowney/Aesthetics/philos_artists_onart/danto.htm#top |title=Arthur Danto |accessdate=2009-12-21 |last=Cloweny |first=David W. |date=December 21, 2009 |publisher=Rowan university |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227094138/http://www.rowan.edu/open/philosop/clowney/Aesthetics/philos_artists_onart/danto.htm#top |archive-date=December 27, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "end of art" refers to the beginning of our modern era of art in which art no longer adheres to the constraints of [[mimesis|imitation theory]] but serves a new purpose. Art began with an "era of imitation, followed by an era of ideology, followed by our post-historical era in which, with qualification, anything goes... In our narrative, at first only mimesis [imitation] was art, then several things were art but each tried to extinguish its competitors, and then, finally, it became apparent that there were no stylistic or philosophical constraints. There is no special way works of art have to be. And that is the present and, I should say, the final moment in the master narrative. It is the end of the story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Danto | first = Arthur Coleman | authorlink = Arthur Danto | coauthors =  | title = After the end of art: contemporary art and the pale of history | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1998 | location =  | pages = 47 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2y2ChJWfYoYC&amp;dq=after+the+end+of+art. | doi =  | isbn = 0-691-00299-1 }} As quoted by Professor David W. Cloweny on his website. [http://www.rowan.edu/open/philosop/clowney/Aesthetics/philos_artists_onart/danto.htm#top] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227094138/http://www.rowan.edu/open/philosop/clowney/Aesthetics/philos_artists_onart/danto.htm#top |date=2009-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art criticism==
Arthur Danto was an art critic for ''[[The Nation]]'' from 1984 to 2009, and also published numerous articles in other journals. In addition, he was an editor of ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'' and a contributing editor of the ''[[Naked Punch Review]]'' and ''[[Artforum]]''.  In [[art criticism]], he published several collected essays, including ''Encounters and Reflections: Art in the Historical Present'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1990), which won the [[National Book Critics Circle]] Prize for Criticism in 1990; ''Beyond the Brillo Box: The Visual Arts in Post-Historical Perspective'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1992); ''Playing With the Edge: The Photographic Achievement of [[Robert Mapplethorpe]]'' (University of California, 1995); ''The Madonna of the Future: Essays in a Pluralistic Art World'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2000); and ''Unnatural Wonders: Essays from the Gap Between Art and Life'' (Columbia University Press, 2007).

In 1996, he received the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for art criticism from the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref name="caa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/matherpast|title=Awards|publisher=The College Art Association|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=October 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archivedate=October 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''artist''' is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the [[arts]], or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday [[speech]] and academic [[discourse]] is a practitioner in the [[visual art]]s only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a [[business]] context, for [[musician|musicians]] and other performers (less often for actors). "Artiste" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.

==Dictionary definitions==
Wiktionary defines the noun 'artist' (Singular: artist; Plural: artists) as follows:
# A person who creates art.
# A person who makes and creates art as an [[wikt:occupation|occupation]].
# A person who is skilled at some activity.
# A person whose trade or profession requires a knowledge of design, drawing, painting, etc.
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the older broad meanings of the term "artist":

* A learned person or Master of Arts
* One who pursues a practical science, traditionally medicine, [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[chemistry]]
* A follower of a pursuit in which skill comes by study or practice
* A follower of a manual art, such as a mechanic
* One who makes their [[craft]] a fine art
* One who cultivates one of the [[fine arts]] – traditionally the arts presided over by the [[muses]]

==History of the term==
The Greek word "techně", often translated as "art," implies mastery of any sort of craft. The adjectival Latin form of the word, "technicus",&lt;ref&gt;
[[Oxford English Dictionary]] s.v. ''technic''
&lt;/ref&gt;
became the source of the English words [[wikt:technique|technique]], technology, [[wikt:technical|technical]].

In Greek culture each of the nine [[Muse]]s oversaw a different field of human creation:
* [[Calliope]] (the 'beautiful of speech'): chief of the muses and muse of [[epic poetry|epic or heroic poetry]]
* [[Clio]] (the 'glorious one'): muse of history
* [[Erato]] (the 'amorous one'): muse of [[love poetry|love or erotic poetry]], lyrics, and marriage songs
* [[Euterpe]] (the 'well-pleasing'): muse of music and [[lyric poetry]]
* [[Melpomene]] (the 'chanting one'): muse of [[tragedy]]
* [[Polyhymnia]] or Polymnia (the '[singer] of many [[hymn]]s'): muse of [[sacred|sacred song]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[Lyrics|lyric]], singing, and [[rhetoric]]
* [[Terpsichore]] (the '[one who] delights in dance'): muse of [[choral]] song and dance
* [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]] (the 'blossoming one'): muse of comedy and [[bucolic poetry]]
* [[Urania]] (the 'celestial one'): muse of [[astronomy]]

No muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.&lt;ref&gt;
''In Our Time: The Artist'' [[BBC Radio 4]], TX 28 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''art'' derives from the Latin "ars" (stem ''art-''), which, although literally defined, means "skill method" or "technique", and conveys a connotation of beauty.

During the Middle Ages the word ''artist'' already existed in some countries such as Italy, but the meaning was something resembling ''craftsman'', while the word ''artesan'' was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some "artisanal" products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.

The first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472): ''[[De re aedificatoria]], De statua, De pictura'', which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a [[project]] behind).&lt;ref&gt;
P.Galloni, ''Il sacro artefice. Mitologie degli artigiani medievali'', Laterza, [[Bari]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Academy|Academies]] in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.

Many contemporary definitions of "artist" and "art" are highly contingent on culture, resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into [[kitsch]].

==The present day concept of an 'artist'==
''Artist'' is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as "a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium". The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person [[creativity|creative]] in, [[innovation|innovative]] in, or adept at, an artistic practice.

Most often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or '[[high culture]]', activities such as drawing, painting, [[sculpture]], acting, dancing, writing, filmmaking, [[New media art|new media]], photography, and music—people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an [[aesthetic]] value. [[Art history|Art historians]] and [[Art critic|critics]] define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline. Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] include [[artisan]], [[Master craftsman|craftsman]], and specialized terms such as [[pottery|potter]], [[goldsmith]] or [[glassblower]]. Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the [[Renaissance]] in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level.

The term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-"art" activities, as well— law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.

Often, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among "artist" and "[[technician]]", "entertainer" and "[[artisan]]", "[[fine arts|fine art]]" and "[[applied art]]", or what constitutes art and what does not. The French word ''artiste'' (which in French, simply means "artist") has been imported into the English language where it means a performer (frequently in [[Music Hall]] or [[Vaudeville]]). Use of the word "artiste" can also be a [[pejorative]] term.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth G. Wilson. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=artist++uncomplimentary+%22artiste%22&amp;source=web&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result The Columbia guide to standard American English].&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.

In ''Living with Art'', Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Getlein |first=Mark |date=2012 |title=Living with Art |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0-07-337925-8 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Create places for some human purpose.
#Create extraordinary versions of ordinary objects.
#Record and commemorate.
#Give tangible form to the unknown.
#Give tangible form to feelings.
#Refresh our vision and help see the world in new ways.

After looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies &amp; program outcomes regarding artists, arts, &amp; culture, Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper propose the divide between "arts for art's sake" artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that "this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down" (Eikhof &amp; Haunschild, 2007). Lingo and Tepper point out:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's The Invention of Art: A Cultural History |url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519 |website=www.contempaesthetics.org |accessdate=2015-07-23 |date=21 December 2008 |publisher= |authorlink= |first=David |last=Clowney}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#arts ''consumers'' don't restrict themselves to either "high" or "common" arts; instead, they demonstrate "omnivorous tastes, liking both reggae and Rachmaninoff" (Peterson &amp; Kern, 1996; Walker &amp; Scott-Melnyk, 2002)
#data indicates "artists are willing to move across sectors and no longer see working outside the commercial sector as a badge of distinction or authenticity" (Bridgstock, 2013; Ellmeier, 2003)
#academic, policy, and government leaders are adapting—widening—programs &amp; opportunities in recognition of "the role of artists as drivers of economic growth and innovation" (Bohm &amp; Land, 2009; DCMS, 2006, 2008; Florida, 2012; Hesmondhalgh &amp; Baker, 2010; Lloyd, 2010; Iyengar, 2013).
#arts graduates name "business and management skills" as the "number one area [they] wish they had been more exposed to in college" (Strategic National Arts Alumni Project [SNAAP], 2011; Tepper &amp; Kuh, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=concept of artist |url=http://www.goines.net/Writing/what_is_artist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and employment ==
The [[US Bureau of Labor Statistics]] classifies many visual artists as either ''craft artists'' or ''fine artists''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/craft-and-fine-artists.htm|title=Craft and Fine Artists|last=|first=|date=17 December 2015|website=|series=Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-21|edition=2016–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A craft artist makes handmade functional works of art, such as pottery or clothing.  A fine artist makes paintings, illustrations (such as [[book illustration]]s or [[medical illustration]]s), sculptures, or similar artistic works primarily for their aesthetic value.

The main source of skill for both craft artists and fine artists is long-term repetition and practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many fine artists have studied their art form at university and some have a master's degree in fine arts.  Artists may also study on their own or receive on-the-job training from an experienced artist.

The number of available jobs as an artist is increasing more slowly than other fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  About half of US artists are self-employed.  Others work in a variety of industries.  For example, a pottery manufacturer will employ craft artists, and book publishers will hire illustrators.

In the US, fine artists have a median income of approximately US $50,000 per year, and craft artists have a median income of approximately US $33,000 per year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This compares to US $61,000 for all art-related fields, including related jobs such as [[graphic designer]]s, [[multimedia artist]]s, [[animator]]s, and [[fashion designers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many artists work part-time as artists and hold a second job.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Ibn Rushd''' ({{lang-ar|{{larger|ابن رشد}}}}; [[Arabic name|full name]] {{Lang-ar|أبو الوليد محمد ابن احمد ابن رشد|translit=Abū l-Walīd Muḥammad Ibn ʾAḥmad Ibn Rušd}}; 1126 – 11 December 1198), often [[Latinization of names|Latinized]] as '''Averroes''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|v|ɛr|oʊ|iː|z}}), was a [[Muslim]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Averroes&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] philosopher and thinker who wrote about many subjects, including [[philosophy]], [[theology]], [[medicine]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[Islamic jurisprudence]] and [[Islamic law|law]], and [[linguistics]]. His philosophical works include numerous commentaries on [[Aristotle]], for which he was known in the West as ''The Commentator''. He also served as a judge and a court physician for the [[Almohad caliphate]].

He was born in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in 1126 to a family of prominent judges—his grandfather was the celebrated chief judge of the city. In 1169 he was introduced to the caliph [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf]], who was impressed with his knowledge, became his patron and commissioned many of Averroes' commentaries. Averroes later served multiple terms as a judge in [[Seville]] and Córdoba. In 1182, he was appointed as court physician and the chief judge of Córdoba. After Abu Yusuf's death in 1184, he remained in royal favor until he fell into disgrace in 1195. He was targeted on various charges—likely for political reasons—and was exiled to nearby [[Lucena, Córdoba|Lucena]]. He returned to royal favor shortly before his death on 11 December 1198.

Averroes was a strong proponent of [[Aristotelianism]]; he attempted to restore what he considered the original teachings of Aristotle and opposed the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] tendencies of earlier Muslim thinkers, such as [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]]. He also defended the pursuit of philosophy against criticism by [[Ashari]] theologians such as [[Al-Ghazali]]. Averroes argued that philosophy was permissible in Islam and even compulsory among certain elites. He also argued scriptural text should be interpreted allegorically if it appeared to contradict conclusions reached by reason and philosophy. His legacy in the Islamic world was modest for geographical and intellectual reasons.

In the West, Averroes was known for his extensive commentaries on Aristotle, many of which were translated into Latin and Hebrew. The translations of his work reawakened Western European interest in Aristotle and Greek thinkers, an area of study that had been widely abandoned after the [[fall of the Roman Empire]]. His thoughts generated controversies in Latin Christendom and triggered a philosophical movement called [[Averroism]] based on his writings. His [[unity of the intellect]] thesis, proposing that all humans share the same intellect, became one of the most well-known and controversial Averroist doctrines in the West.  His works were condemned by the Catholic Church in 1270 and 1277. Although weakened by the condemnations and sustained critique by [[Thomas Aquinas]], Latin Averroism continued to attract followers up to the sixteenth century.

[[File:AverroesColor.jpg|thumb|Ibn Rushd was the preeminent philosopher in the history of [[Al-Andalus]]. 14th-century painting by [[Andrea di Bonaiuto da Firenze|Andrea di Bonaiuto]].]]

=== Early life and education ===
Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Rushd was born in 1126 (520 [[Hijri calendar|AH]]{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=909}}) in [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]].{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Biography}} His family was well-known in the city for their public service, especially in the legal and religious fields.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Biography}} His grandfather Abu al-Walid Muhammad (d. 1126) was the chief judge (''[[qadi]]'') of Córdoba and the imam of the [[Great Mosque of Córdoba]] under the [[Almoravid]]s.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Biography}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=909}} His father Abu al-Qasim Ahmad was not as celebrated as his grandfather, but was also chief judge until the Almoravids were replaced by the [[Almohad]]s in 1146.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Biography}}

According to his traditional biographers, Averroes' education was "excellent",{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=909}} beginning with studies in [[hadith]] (traditions of Prophet [[Muhammad]]), ''fiqh'' ([[Islamic jurisprudence|jurisprudence]]), medicine and theology. He learned [[Maliki jurisprudence]] under al-Hafiz Abu Muhammad ibn Rizq and hadith with Ibn Bashkuwal, a student of his grandfather.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=909}}{{sfn|Wohlman|2009|p=16}} His father also taught him about jurisprudence, including on [[Imam Malik]]'s ''magnum opus'' the ''[[Muwatta Imam Malik|Muwatta]]'', which Averroes went on to memorize.{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=190}}{{sfn|Iskandar|2008|p=1116}} He studied medicine under Abu Jafar Jarim al-Tajail, who probably taught him philosophy too.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} He also knew the works of the philosopher [[Ibn Bajjah]] (also known as Avempace), and might have known him personally or been tutored by him.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Biography}}{{sfn|Wohlman|2009|p=16}} He joined a regular meeting of philosophers, physicians and poets in [[Seville]] which was attended by philosophers [[Ibn Tufayl]] and [[Ibn Zuhr]] as well as the future caliph [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur|Abu Yusuf Yaqub]].{{sfn|Iskandar|2008|p=1116}} He also studied the ''[[kalam]]'' theology of the [[Ashari]] school, which he criticized later in life.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} His 13th century biographer [[Ibn al-Abbar]] said he was more interested in the study of law and [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|its principles]] (''usul'') than that of hadith and he was especially competent in the field of ''[[Glossary of Islam#K|khilaf]]'' (disputes and controversies in the Islamic jurisprudence).{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} Ibn al-Abbar also mentioned his interests in "the sciences of the ancients", probably in reference to Greek philosophy and sciences.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}}

=== Career ===
[[File:Almohad Expansion.png|thumb|Averroes served various official positions in the [[Almohad caliphate]], whose territories are depicted in this map.]]

By 1153 Averroes was in [[Marrakesh]] (in present-day Morocco), the capital of the [[Almohad caliphate]], to perform astronomical observations and to support the Almohad project of building new colleges.{{sfn|Iskandar|2008|p=1116}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} He was hoping to find physical laws of astronomical movements instead of only the mathematical laws known at the time but this research was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} During his stay in Marrakesh he likely met [[Ibn Tufayl]], a renowned philosopher and the author of ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' who was also the court physician in Marrakesh.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}}{{sfn|Wohlman|2009|p=16}} Averroes and ibn Tufayl became friends despite the differences in their philosophies.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=1}}{{sfn|Wohlman|2009|p=16}}

In 1169 Ibn Tufayl introduced Averroes to the Almohad caliph [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} In a famous account reported by historian [[Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi]] the caliph asked Averroes whether the heavens had existed since eternity or had a beginning.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} Knowing this question was controversial and worried a wrong answer could put him in danger, Averroes did not answer.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}} The caliph then elaborated the views of Plato, Aristotle and Muslim philosophers on the topic and discussed them with Ibn Tufayl.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} This display of knowledge put Averroes at ease; Averroes then explained his own views on the subject, which impressed the caliph.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} Averroes was similarly impressed by Abu Yaqub and later said the caliph had "a profuseness of learning I did not suspect".{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}

After their introduction, Averroes remained in Abu Yaqub's favor until the caliph's death in 1184.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} When the caliph complained to Ibn Tufayl about the difficulty of understanding Aristotle's work, Ibn Tufayl recommended to the caliph that Averroes work on explaining it.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} This was the beginning of Averroes' massive commentaries on Aristotle;{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}} his first works on the subject were written in 1169.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}

In the same year, Averroes was appointed ''[[qadi]]'' (judge) in Seville.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}}{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=196}} In 1171 he became ''qadi'' in his hometown of Córdoba.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}}{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=190}} As ''qadi'' he would decide cases and give ''[[fatwa]]''s (legal opinions) based on the [[Islamic law]] (''sharia'').{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=196}} The rate of his writing increased during this time despite other obligations and his travels within the Almohad empire.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} He also took the opportunity from his travels to conduct astronomical researches.{{sfn|Iskandar|2008|p=1116}} Many of his works produced between 1169 and 1179 were dated in Seville rather than Córdoba.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} In 1179 he was again appointed ''qadi'' in Seville.{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=190}} In 1182 he succeeded his friend Ibn Tufayl as court physician and later the same year he was appointed the chief ''qadi'' of Córdoba, a prestigious office that had once been held by his grandfather.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}}{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=196}}

In 1184 Caliph Abu Yaqub died and was succeeded by [[Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur]].{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} Initially, Averroes remained in royal favor but in 1195 his fortune reversed.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}} Various charges were made against him and he was tried by a tribunal in Córdoba.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} The tribunal condemned his teachings, ordered the burning of his works and banished Averroes to nearby [[Lucena, Córdoba|Lucena]].{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} Early biographers' reasons for this fall from grace include a possible insult to the caliph in his writings{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}} but modern scholars attribute it to political reasons. The ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' said the caliph distanced himself from Averroes to gain support from more orthodox ''ulema'', who opposed Averroes and whose support al-Mansur needed for his war against Christian kingdoms.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} Historian of Islamic philosophy [[Majid Fakhry]] also wrote that public pressure from traditional Maliki jurists who were opposed to Averroes played a role.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=2}}

After a few years, Averroes returned to court in Marrakesh and was again in the caliph's favor.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} He died shortly afterwards, on 11 December 1198 (9 Safar 595 in the [[Hijri calendar|Islamic calendar]]).{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} He was initially buried in North Africa but his body was later moved Córdoba for another funeral, at which future Sufi mystic and philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]] (1165–1240) was present.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}}

== Works ==

[[File:AverroesAndPorphyry.JPG|thumb|Imaginary debate between Averroes and third-century philosopher [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]. Monfredo de Monte Imperiali ''Liber de herbis'', 14th century.]]
{{See also|List of works by Averroes}}

Averroes was a prolific writer and his works, according to Fakhry, "covered a greater variety of subjects" than those of any of his predecessors in the East, including philosophy, medicine, jurisprudence or legal theory, and linguistics.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=3}} Most of his writings were commentaries on or paraphrasings of the works of Aristotle that—especially the long ones—often contain his original thoughts.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=181}} According to French author [[Ernest Renan]], Averroes wrote at least 67 original works, including 28 works on philosophy, 20 on medicine, 8 on law, 5 on theology, and 4 on grammar, in addition to his commentaries on most of Aristotle's works and his commentary on [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''.&lt;ref name="Ahmad"&gt;{{citation|last=Ahmad|first=Jamil|date=September 1994|title=Averroes|journal=[[Al-Mawrid|Monthly Renaissance]]|volume=4|issue=9|url=http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/issue/content.aspx?id=744|accessdate=14 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Averroes' works in Arabic did not survive, but their translations into Hebrew or Latin did.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|pp=180–181}} For example, of his long commentaries on Aristotle, only "a tiny handful of Arabic manuscript remains".{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=180}}

=== Commentaries on Aristotle ===
[[File:Arabic aristotle.jpg|thumb|An Arabic illustration of Aristotle teaching a student, {{circa|1220}}. Aristotle's works are the subject of extensive commentaries by Averroes.]]

Averroes wrote commentaries on nearly all of Aristotle's surviving works.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=3}} The only exception is ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'', which he did not have access to, so he wrote commentaries on Plato's [[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=3}} He classified his commentaries into three categories that modern scholars have named ''short'', ''middle'' and ''long'' commentaries.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=180}} Most of the short commentaries (''jami'') were written early in his career and contain summaries of Aristotlean doctrines.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=181}} The middle commentaries (''talkhis'') contain paraphrases that clarify and simplify Aristotle's original text.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=181}} The middle commentaries were probably written in response to his patron caliph [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf]]'s complaints about the difficulty of understanding Aristotle's original texts and to help others in a similar position.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=181}}{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=180}} The long commentaries (''tafsir'' or ''sharh''), or line-by-line commentaries, include the complete text of the original works  with a detailed analysis of each line.{{sfn|McGinnis|Reisman|2007|p=295}} The long commentaries are very detailed and contain a high degree of original thought,{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=181}} and were unlikely to be intended for a general audience.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=180}} Only five of Aristotle's works had all three types of commentaries: ''Physics'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''On the Soul'', ''[[On the Heavens]]'', and ''[[Posterior Analytics]]''.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=3}}

=== Stand alone philosophical works ===
Averroes also wrote stand alone philosophical treatises, including ''On the Intellect'', ''On the Syllogism'', ''On Conjunction with the Active Intellect'', ''On Time'', ''On the Heavenly Sphere'' and ''On the Motion of the Sphere''. He also wrote several [[polemic]]s: ''Essay on [[al-Farabi]]'s Approach to Logic, as Compared to that of Aristotle'', ''Methaphysical Questions Dealt with in the [[Book of Healing]] by Ibn Sina'', and ''Rebuttal of Ibn Sina's Classification of Existing Entities''.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=3}}

=== Islamic theology ===
Scholarly sources, including Fakhry and the ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'', named three theological works as Averroes' key writings in this area. ''[[On the Harmony of Religions and Philosophy|Fasl al-Maqal]]'' ("The Decisive Treatise") is a 1178 treatise that argues for the compatibility of Islam and philosophy.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|pp=911–912}} ''Al-Kashf 'an Manahij al-Adillah'' ("Exposition of the Methods of Proof"), written in 1179, criticizes the theologies of the [[Ashari]]tes,{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|pp=913–914}} and lays out Averroes' argument for proving the existence of God, as well as his thoughts on God's attributes and actions.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|pp=914}} The 1180 ''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence|Tahafut al-Tahafut]]'' ("Incoherence of the Incoherence") is a rebuttal of [[al-Ghazali]]'s (d. 1111) landmark criticism of philosophy ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]''. It combines ideas in his commentaries and stand alone works, and uses them to respond to al-Ghazali.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|pp=915}} The work also criticizes Avicenna and his [[neo-Platonism|neo-Platonist]] tendencies, sometimes agreeing with al-Ghazali's critique against him.{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|pp=915}}

=== Medicine ===
[[File:Colliget Auerrois totam medicinam V00026 00000002.tif|thumb|Title page from a Latin edition of ''Colliget'', Averroes' main work in medicine]]
Averroes, who served as the royal physician at the Almohad court, wrote a number of medical treatises. The most famous was ''[[Colliget|al-Kulliyat fi al-Tibb]]'' ("General Principles of Medicine", Latinized in the west as the ''Colliget''), written around 1162, before his appointment at court.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=124}} The Latin translation became a medical texbook in Europe for centuries.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=124}} He also wrote summaries of the works of Greek physician [[Galen]] (died {{circa|210}}) and a commentary on [[Avicenna]]'s ''Urjuzah fi al-Tibb'' ("Poem on Medicine").{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=124}}

=== Jurisprudence and law ===
Averroes served multiple tenures as judge and produced multiple works in the fields of Islamic jurisprudence or legal theory. The only book that survives today is ''Bidāyat al-Mujtahid wa Nihāyat al-Muqtaṣid'' ("Primer of the Discretionary Scholar").{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=xvi}} In this work he explains the legal difference between the Sunni ''[[madhhab]]''s (schools of Islamic jurisprudence) both in practice and in their underlying juristic principles.{{sfn|Dutton|1994|p=188}} Despite his status as a [[Maliki]] judge, the book also discusses the opinion of other schools, including liberal and conservative ones.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=xvi}} Other than this surviving text, bibliographical information shows he wrote a summary of [[Al-Ghazali]]'s ''[[On Legal Theory of Muslim Jurisprudence]]'' (''Al-Mustasfa'') and tracts on [[Qurbani|sacrifices]] and land tax.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=115}}

== Philosophical ideas ==
=== Aristotelianism in the Islamic philosophical tradition ===
In his philosophical writings, Averroes attempted to return to [[Aristotelianism]], which according to him had been distorted by the Neoplatonist tendencies of Muslim philosophers such as [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=5}}{{sfn|Leaman|2002|p=27}} He rejected [[al-Farabi]]'s attempt to merge the ideas of Plato and Aristotle's, pointing out the difference between the two, such as Aristotle's rejection of Plato's [[Theory of forms|theory of ideas]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=6}} He also criticized Al-Farabi's works on logic for misinterpreting its Aristotelian source.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|pp=6–7}} He wrote an extensive critique of Avicenna, who was the standard-bearer of Islamic Neoplatonism in the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=7}} He argued that Avicenna's theory of [[Emanationism|emanation]] had many fallacies and was not found in the works of Aristotle.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=7}} Averroes disagreed with Avicenna's view that existence is merely an [[Accident (philosophy)|accident]] added to essence, arguing the reverse; something exists ''per se'' and essence can only be found by subsequent abstraction.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|pp=8–9}}. He also rejected [[Avicenna's modality]] and [[Proof of the Truthful|Avicenna's argument]] to prove the existence of God as the Necessary Existent.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=9}}

=== Relation between religion and philosophy ===

During Averroes' lifetime, philosophy came under attack from the [[Sunni]] Islam tradition, especially from theological schools like the [[Traditionalist theology (Islam)|traditionalist (Hanbalite)]] and the [[Ashari theology|Ashari]] schools.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Philosophy and Religion}} In particular, the Ashari scholar [[al-Ghazali]] (1058&amp;nbsp;–&amp;#32;1111) wrote ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'' (''Tahafut al-falasifa''), a scathing and influential critique of the Neoplatonic philosophical tradition in the Islamic world and against the works of Avicenna in particular.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=paragraph 2}} Among others, Al-Ghazali charged philosophers with non-belief in Islam and sought to disprove the teaching of the philosophers using logical arguments.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Philosophy and Religion}}{{sfn|Leaman|2002|p=55}}

In ''Decisive Treatise'', Averroes argues that philosophy—which for him represented conclusions reached using reason and careful method—cannot contradict revelations in Islam because they are just two different methods of reaching the truth, and "truth cannot contradict truth".{{sfn|Guessoum|2011|p=xx}}{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=184}} When conclusions reached by philosophy appear to contradict the text of the revelation, then according to Averroes, revelation must be subjected to interpretation or allegorical understanding to remove the contradiction.{{sfn|Guessoum|2011|p=xx}}{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Philosophy and Religion}} This interpretation must be done by those "rooted in knowledge"—a phrase taken by from the Quran 3:7, which for Averroes refers to philosophers who during his lifetime had access to the "highest methods of knowledge".{{sfn|Guessoum|2011|p=xx}}{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=184}} He also argues that the Quran calls for Muslims to study philosophy because the study and reflection of nature would increase a person's knowledge of "the Artisan" (God).{{sfn|Guessoum|2011|p=xxii}} He quotes Quranic passages calling on Muslims to reflect on nature and used them to render a ''[[fatwa]]'' (legal opinion) that philosophy is allowed for Muslims and is probably an obligation, at least among those who have the talent for it.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=182}}

Averroes also distinguishes between three modes of discourse; the [[rhetoric]]al (based on persuasion) accessible to the common masses; the [[dialectic]]al (based on debate) and often employed by theologians and the ''[[ulama]]'' (scholars); and the demonstrative (based on logical deduction).{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Philosophy and Religion}}{{sfn|Guessoum|2011|p=xxii}} According to Averroes, the Quran uses the rhetorical method of inviting people to the truth, which allows it to reach the common masses with its persuasiveness,{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=183}} whereas philosophy uses the demonstrative methods that were only available to the learned but provided the best possible understanding and knowledge.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=183}}

Averroes also tries to deflect Al-Ghazali's criticisms of philosophy by saying that many of them apply only to the philosophy of Avicenna and not that of Aristotle, which Averroes argues to be the true philosophy from which Avicenna deviated.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=181}}

=== Nature of God ===
==== Existence ====
Averroes lays out his views on the existence and nature of God in the treatise ''The Exposition of the Methods of Proof''.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=74}} He examines and critiques the doctrines of four sects of Islam: the [[Asharites]], the [[Mutazilites]], the [[Sufis]] and those he calls the "literalists" (''al-hashwiyah'').{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=74}} Among other things, he examines their proofs of God's existence and critiques each one.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}} Averroes argues that there are two arguments for God's existence that he deems logically sound and in accordance to the Quran; the arguments from "providence" and "from invention".{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}} The providence argument considers that the world and the universe seem finely tuned to support human life. Averroes cited the sun, the moon, the rivers, the seas and the location of humans on the earth.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=77}} According to him, this suggests a creator who created them for the welfare of mankind.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=77}}{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}} The argument from invention contends that worldly entities such as animals and plants appear to have been invented. Therefore, Averroes argues that a designer was behind the creation and that is God.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}} Averroes's two arguments are [[Teleological argument|teleological]] in nature and not [[cosmological argument|cosmological]] like the arguments of [[Aristotle]] and most contemporaneous Muslim [[kalam]] theologians.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|pp=77–78}}

==== God's attributes ====
Averroes upholds the doctrine of divine unity (''[[tawhid]]'') and argues—in agreement with contemporary theologians—that God has seven [[God#Specific attributes|divine attributes]]: knowledge, life, power, will, hearing, vision and speech. He devotes the most attention to the attribute of knowledge and argues that divine knowledge differs from human knowledge because God knows the universe because God is its cause while humans only know the universe through its effects.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}}

Averroes argues that the attribute of life can be inferred because it is the precondition of knowledge and also because God willed objects into being.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=79}} Power can be inferred by God's ability to bring creations into existence. Averroes also argues that knowledge and power inevitably give rise to speech. Regarding vision and speech, he says that because God created the world, he necessarily knows every part of it in the same way an artist understands his or her work intimately. Because two elements of the world are the visual and the auditory, God must necessarily possess the vision and speech.{{sfn|Hillier|loc=Existence and Attributes of God}}

=== Pre-eternity of the world ===
In the centuries preceding Averroes, there had been a debate between Muslim thinkers questioning whether the world was created at a specific moment in time or whether it has [[eternity of the universe|always existed]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=14}} [[Neo-Platonism|Neo-Platonic]] philosophers such as [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]] argued the world has always existed.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=18}}  This view was criticized by theologians and philosophers of the [[Ashari]] [[kalam]] tradition; in particular, al-Ghazali wrote an extensive refutation of the pre-eternity doctrine in his ''[[Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'' and accused the Neo-Platonic philosophers of unbelief (''[[kufr]]'').{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=18}}

Averroes responded to Al-Ghazali in his ''[[Incoherence of the Incoherence]]''. First, he argued that the differences between the two positions were not vast enough to warrant the charge of unbelief.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=18}} He also said the pre-eternity doctrine did not necessarily contradict the Quran and cited verses that mention pre-existing "throne" and "water" in passages related to creation.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=19}}{{sfn|Hillier  |loc=Origin of the World}} Averroes argued that a careful reading of the Quran implied only the "form" of the universe was created in time but that its existence has been eternal.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=19}} Averroes further criticized the ''kalam'' theologians for using their own interpretations of scripture to answer questions that should have been left to philosophers.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|pp=19–20}}

=== Politics ===
Averroes states his political philosophy in his commentary of Plato's [[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]. He combines his ideas with Plato's and with Islamic tradition; he considers the ideal state to be one based on the Islamic law (''[[shariah]]'').{{sfn|Rosenthal|2017|loc=Contents And Significance Of Works}}  His interpretation of Plato's [[philosopher-king]] followed that of [[Al-Farabi]], which equates the philosopher-king with the [[imam]], [[caliph]] and lawgiver of the state.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=111}}{{sfn|Rosenthal|2017|loc=Contents And Significance Of Works}} Averroes' description of the characteristics of a philosopher-king are similar to those given by Al-Farabi; they include love of knowledge, good memory, love of learning, love of truth, dislike for sensual pleasures, dislike for amassing wealth, magnanimity, courage, steadfastness, eloquence and the ability to "light quickly on the [[middle term]]".{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=111}} Averroes writes that if philosophers cannot rule—as was the case in the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] and [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] empires around his lifetime—philosophers must still try to influence the rulers towards implementing the ideal state.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2017|loc=Contents And Significance Of Works}}

According to Averroes, there are two methods of teaching virtue to citizens; persuasion and coercion.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=106}} Persuasion is the more natural method consisting of rhetorical, dialectical and demonstrative methods; sometimes, however, coercion is necessary for those not amenable to persuasion, e.g. enemies of the state.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=106}} Therefore, he justifies war as a last resort, which he also supports using Quranic arguments.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=106}} Consequently, he argues that a ruler should have both wisdom and courage, which are needed for governance and defense of the state.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=107}}

Like Plato, Averroes calls for women to share with men in the administration of the state, including participating as soldiers, philosophers and rulers.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=110}} He regrets that contemporaneous Muslim societies limited the public role of women; he says this limitation is harmful to the state's well-being.{{sfn|Rosenthal|2017|loc=Contents And Significance Of Works}}

Averroes also accepted Plato's ideas of the deterioration of the ideal state. He cites examples from Islamic history when the [[Rashidun caliphate]]—which in Sunni tradition represented the ideal state led by "rightly guided caliphs"—became a dynastic state under [[Muawiyah]], founder of the [[Umayyad dynasty]]. He also says the Almoravid and the Almohad empires started as ideal, shariah-based states but then deteriorated into [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]] and [[tyranny]].{{sfn|Rosenthal|2017|loc=Contents And Significance Of Works}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=112–114}}

== Natural philosophy ==
=== Astronomy ===
As did [[Avempace]] and [[Ibn Tufail]], Averroes criticizes the [[Ptolemaic system]] using philosophical arguments and rejects the use of [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentrics]] and [[epicycles]] to explain the apparent motions of the moon, the sun and the planets. He argued that those objects move uniformly in a strictly circular motion around the earth, following Aristotelian principles.{{sfn|Forcada|2007|pp=554–555}} He postulates that there are three type of planetary motions; those that can be seen with the naked eye, those that requires instruments to observe and those that can only be known by philosophical reasoning.{{sfn|Iskandar|2008|p=1116}} Averroes attempted to redefine astronomy as being based on [[physics]] rather than just [[mathematics]] as was commonly practiced by Arabic and Andalusian astronomers of his time; later in his life he declared that his attempts had failed.{{sfn|Forcada|2007|pp=554–555}}{{sfn|Arnaldez|1986|p=910}} Averroes argues that the occasional opaque colors of the moon are caused by variations in its thickness; the thicker parts receive more light from the Sun than the thinner parts.&lt;ref&gt;Ariew, Roger (2011). [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=OFD0lVQ4RIQC Descartes Among the Scholastics]. BRILL. p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physics ===
In physics, Averroes did not adopt the [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] method that was being developed by [[Al-Biruni]] in the Islamic world and is closer to today's physics.{{sfn|Guessoum|2011|p=xxii}} Rather, he was—in the words of historian of science [[Ruth Glasner]]—a "exegetical" scientist who produced new theses about nature through discussions of previous texts, especially the writings of Aristotle.{{sfn|Glasner|2009|p=4}} because of this approach, he was often depicted as an unimaginative follower of Aristotle, but Glasner argues that Averroes' work introduced highly original theories of physics, especially his elaboration of Aristotle's ''[[minima naturalia]]'' and on motion as ''[[forma fluens]]'', which were taken up in the West and are important to the overall development of physics.{{sfn|Glasner|2009|pp=1–2}} Averroes also proposed a definition of force as "the rate at which work is done in changing the kinetic condition of a material body"—a definition close to the definition of [[Power (physics)|power]] in today's physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agutter|first1=Paul S.|last2=Wheatley|first2=Denys N.|title=Thinking about Life: The history and philosophy of biology and other sciences|date=2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-8866-7|p=45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gm4bqeBMR8cC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Averroes+kinetic+force#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology ===
[[File:Bnf lat16151 f22.jpg|thumb|''The Long Commentary on Aristotle's ''[[On the Soul]], French Manuscript, third quarter of the 13th century]]

Averroes expounds his thoughts on psychology in his three commentaries on Aristotle's ''[[On the Soul]]''.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=188}} Averroes is interested in explaining the human intellect using philosophical methods and by interpreting Aristotle's ideas.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=188}} His position on the topic changed throughout his career as his thoughts developed.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=188}} In his short commentary, the first of the three works, Averroes follows [[Ibn Bajja]]'s theory that something called the "[[Passive intellect|material intellect]]" stores specific images that a person encounters.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=189–190}} These images serve as basis for the "unification" by the universal "[[agent intellect]]", which, once it happens, allow a person to gain universal knowledge about that concept.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=190}} In his middle commentary, Averroes moves towards the ideas of Al-Farabi and Avicenna, saying the agent intellect gives humans the power of universal understanding, which is the material intellect.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=190}} Once the person has sufficient empirical encounters with a certain concept, the power activates and gives the person universal knowledge{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=190}} (see also [[logical induction]]).

In his last commentary—called the ''Long Commentary''—he proposes another theory, which becomes known as the theory of "the [[unity of the intellect]]". In it, Averroes argues that there is only one material intellect, which is the same for all humans and is unmixed with human body.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=191}} To explain how different individuals can have different thoughts, he uses a concept he calls ''fikr''—known as ''cogitatio'' in Latin—a process that happens in human brains and contains not universal knowledge but "active consideration of particular things" the person has encountered.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=191}} This theory attracted controversy when Averroes' works entered Christian Europe; in 1229 [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote a detailed critique titled ''On the Unity of the Intellect against the Averroists''.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=188}}{{sfn|Hasse|2014|loc=Averroes' Unicity Thesis}}

== Legacy ==
{{Main|Averroism}}
=== In Jewish tradition ===
[[Maimonides]] (d. 1204) was among early Jewish scholars who received Averroes' works enthusiastically, saying he "received lately everything Averroes had written on the works of Aristotle" and that Averroes "was extremely right".{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=132}} Thirteenth-century Jewish writers, including [[Samuel ibn Tibbon]] in his work ''Opinion of the Philosophers'', [[Judah ibn Solomon Cohen]] in his ''Search for Wisdom'' and [[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera]],  relied heavily on Averroes' texts.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=132}} In 1232, [[Joseph Ben Abba Mari]] translated Averroes' commentaries on the ''[[Organon]]''; this was the first Jewish translation of a complete work. In 1260 [[Moses Ben Tibbon]] published the translation of almost all of Averroes' commentaries and some of his works on medicine.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=132}} Jewish Averroism peaked in the fourteenth century;{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=133}} Jewish writers of this time who translated or were influenced by Averroes include [[Kalonymus ben Kalonymus]] of [[Arles]], France, [[Samuel ibn Judah of Marseilles]], [[Todros Todrosi]] of Arles and [[Gersonides]] of [[Languedoc]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|pp=132–133}}

=== In Latin tradition ===
Averroes' main influence on the Christian West was through his extensive commentaries on Aristotle.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=131}} After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], western Europe fell into a cultural decline that resulted in the loss of nearly all of the intellectual legacy of the Classical Greek scholars, including Aristotle.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=129}} Averroes' commentaries, which were translated into Latin and entered Western Europe in the thirteenth century, provided an expert account of Aristotle's legacy and made them available again.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|pp=181–182}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=133}} The influence of his commentaries led to Averroes being referred to simply as "The Commentator" rather than by name in Latin Christian writings.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=180}}

[[Michael Scot]] (1175 – c. 1232) was the first Latin translator of Averroes who translated the long commentaries of ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', ''[[On the Soul]]'' and ''[[On the Heavens]]'', as well as multiple middle and short commentaries, starting in 1217 in [[Paris]] and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=133–134}} Following this, European authors such as [[Hermannus Alemannus]], [[William de Luna]] and [[Armengaud of Montpellier]] translated Averroes' other works, sometimes with help from Jewish authors.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=134}} Soon after, Averroes' works propagated among Christian scholars in the [[scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=134}} His writing attracted a strong circle of followers known as the [[Latin Averroism|Latin Averroists]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=134}} Paris and [[Padua]] were major centers of Latin Averroism, and its prominent thirteenth-century leaders included [[Siger of Brabant]] and [[Boethius of Dacia]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=134}}

Authorities of the Roman Catholic Church reacted against the spread of Averroism. In 1270, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paris|Bishop of Paris]] [[Étienne Tempier]] issued [[Condemnations of 1270|a condemnation]] against 15 doctrines—many of which were Aristotelian or Averroist—that he said were in conflict with the doctrines of the church. In 1277, at the request of [[Pope John XXI]], Tempier issued another condemnation, this time targeting 219 theses drawn from many sources, mainly the teachings of Aristotle and Averroes.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=134–135}}

[[File:Benozzo Gozzoli 004a.jpg|thumb|The ''Triumph of Saint Thomas Aquinas over Averroes'' by Benozzo Gozzoli, depicting [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] (top center), a major Averroes critic, "triumphing" over Averroes (bottom), depicted at the feet of Aquinas.]]
Averroes received a mixed reception from other Catholic thinkers; Thomas Aquinas, a leading Catholic thinker of the thirteenth century, relied extensively on Averroes' interpretation of Aristotle but disagreed with him on many points.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=138}}{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=180}} For example, he wrote a detailed attack on Averroes' theory that all humans share the same intellect.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=192}} He also opposed Averroes on the eternity of the universe and [[divine providence]].{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=140}}

The Catholic Church's condemnations of 1270 and 1277, and the detailed critique by Aquinas weakened the spread of Averroism in Latin Christendom,{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=135}} though it maintained a following until the sixteenth century, when European thought began to diverge from Aristotelianism.{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=133}} Leading Averroists in the following centuries included [[John of Jandun]] and [[Marsilius of Padua]] (fourteenth century), [[Gaetano da Thiene (philosopher)|Gaetano da Thiene]] and [[Pietro Pomponazzi]] (fifteenth century), and [[Agostino Nifo]] and [[Marcantonio Zimara]] (sixteenth century).{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=137–138}}

=== In Islamic tradition ===
Averroes had no major influence on Islamic philosophic thought until modern times.{{sfn|Leaman|2002|p=28}} Part of the reason was geography; Averroes lived in Spain, the extreme west of the Islamic civilization far from the centers of Islamic intellectual traditions.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=181}} Also, his philosophy may not have appealed to Islamic scholars of his time.{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=181}} His focus on Aristotle's works was outdated in the twelfth-century Muslim world, which had already scrutinized Aristotle since the ninth century and by now was engaging deeply with newer schools of thought, especially that of [[Avicenna]].{{sfn|Adamson|2016|p=181}} In the nineteenth century, Muslim thinkers begin to engage with the works Averroes again.{{sfn|Leaman|2002|p=28}} By this time, there was a cultural renaissance called ''[[Al-Nahda]]'' ("reawakening") in the Arabic-speaking world and the works of Averroes were seen as inspiration to modernize the Muslim intellectual tradition.{{sfn|Leaman|2002|p=28}}

== In popular culture ==
[[File:Averroes closeup.jpg|thumb|Averroes, detail of the fresco ''[[The School of Athens]]'' by [[Raphael]]]]

References to Averroes appear in the popular culture of both the Western and Muslim world. The poem ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' by the Italian writer [[Dante Alighieri]], completed in 1320, depicts Averroes, "who made the Great Commentary", along with other non-Christian Greek and Muslim thinkers, in [[Inferno (Dante)#First Circle (Limbo)|Limbo]] around [[Saladin]].{{sfn|Sonneborn|2006|p=94}}{{sfn|Fakhry|2001|p=138}} The prologue of ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (1387) by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] lists Averroes among other medical authorities known in Europe at the time.{{sfn|Sonneborn|2006|p=94}} Averroes is depicted in [[Raphael]]'s 1501 fresco ''[[The School of Athens]]'' that decorates the [[Apostolic Palace]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], which features seminal figures of philosophy. In the painting, Averroes wears a green robe and a turban, and peers out from behind [[Pythagoras]], who is shown writing a book.{{sfn|Sonneborn|2006|p=95}}

A 1947 short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], "[[Averroes's Search]]" ({{lang-es|La Busca de Averroes}}), features his attempts to understand [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Poetics'']] within a culture that lacks a tradition of live theatrical performance.&lt;ref name="ShavitEllison2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ayelet Shavit|author2=Aaron M.

==Initial media attention==
The test was featured on an episode of ''The Today Show'' in June 2005.&lt;ref name="Newhouse"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref name="Today-flash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Globe"/&gt; In that show, [[Katie Couric]] interviewed a woman named Holly Osburn who was mother to two daughters and expecting. Osborn said that she wanted to know the gender because she wanted to paint the nursery blue. Sherry Bonelli, the CEO of PregnancyStore.com was also interviewed and said that the test had only been available for two weeks and that numerous people had inquired about it in a short time. She also said that Acu-Gen had followed 2,000 pregnancies through to completion and that the lab results given by the Baby Gender Mentor had never been wrong . Gender Mentor claimed to have been used in 20,000 pregnancies. On the show the results of Osborn's test revealed that was going to have another girl.{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref name="Today-flash" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Science-Mag" /&gt;
During the same segment of ''The Today Show'', Couric interviewed Dr. Ronald Wapner, head of maternal fetal medicine at [[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital]],{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref name="NY-Daily"&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/337727p-288375c.html |title=Kit makes it a womb with a view |work=New York Daily News |date=August 16, 2005 |accessdate=January 16, 2007 |author=Haberman, Maggie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813223631/http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/337727p-288375c.html |archivedate=August 13, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He discussed possible pros and cons of the test.{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref name="Today-flash" /&gt; His first concern was whether the stated accuracy rate achieved in the 2,000 test cases would be realized in real world usage. His second concern was whether couples who purchase the test might use the results for [[family balancing]], which means the decision to utilize selective abortion to achieve a baby of the desired sex. Wapner said that one positive aspect of the Baby Gender Mentor test is the non-invasive nature of the test, which means there should be no risk of harm to the fetus.{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref name="Today-flash" /&gt;

The test was listed as one of the top 10 innovations of 2005 by research company [[Datamonitor]]. In their report, titled ''Build A Better Mousetrap'', Datamonitor identifies their picks for "the best new food, drink, health, household and pet products of 2005". They listed the test as the number 8 innovation of the year.{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref name="Think"&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16574383&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=66633&amp;headline=what-will-they-think-of-next---name_page.html |title=What Will They Think of Next? |date=January 12, 2006 |accessdate=January 16, 2007 |work=Daily Record (UK) |author=Standfield, Robert |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819132014/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid%3D16574383%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D66633%26headline%3Dwhat-will-they-think-of-next---name_page.html |archivedate=August 19, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy of the test disputed==
At least 40&amp;nbsp;women have come forward to say their Baby Gender Mentor tests predicted the wrong sex.&lt;ref name="Parents sue"/&gt; According to a [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) report, the company has explained certain inaccurate results as being the result of a [[vanishing twin]], a fetus that stopped growing soon after fertilization.&lt;ref name="Boyce2" /&gt; Acu-Gen claimed that their kit could predict a mixed sex set of fraternal twins, so the test should have predicted twins instead of predicting a single baby whose sex turned out to be incorrect.&lt;ref name="Agu-Gen FAQ" /&gt;

With Acu-Gen choosing not to publish proof of its claims and evidence of several women receiving inaccurate predictions, doctors are concerned about the test.  Among the [[scientific evidence]] cited by Acu-Gen's web site is a paper co-authored by Diana Bianchi, an expert on fetal [[DNA]] at [[Tufts University]]. The NPR story quoted Bianchi as saying, "I think at the present time we need to be concerned whether the test is accurate or not", and "I think it's [[caveat emptor]]. Let the buyer beware."&lt;ref name = "Boyce1" /&gt;  Another criticism has come from Sandra Carson, professor of [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrics and gynecology]] and involved in research in sex selection. Carson says, "Until Acu-Gen releases its data, there's no way to know the test's reliability.  Until that's out, I think it shouldn't be on the market."&lt;ref name="Wash-Post"&gt;{{cite news | author=Ault, Alicia | date= July 19, 2005 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/18/AR2005071801128.html | title=The Gender Flap |work=The Washington Post | accessdate=October 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carson at that time was at the [[Baylor College of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="Wash-Post"/&gt;  Dr. [[Charles Lockwood (gynecologist)|Charles Lockwood]], chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at [[Yale School of Medicine]], said that it is possible for fetal DNA to be found in maternal blood as soon as the placenta has developed, and that detection after five weeks "is not impossible" and the president of Acu-Gen said the suit was "totally bogus".&lt;ref name="Parents sue"/&gt;

There are multiple legal challenges and investigations under way.  Gail O'Conner, a spokesperson for the [[Illinois]] [[State Attorney General]], says that they are investigating PregnancyStore.com for possible [[fraud]].&lt;ref name="Boyce2" /&gt; [[Florida]] [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Jim Davis (Florida politician)|Jim Davis]] has urged the FDA to investigate Acu-Gen, and the Florida Attorney General has opened an investigation against Acu-Gen.&lt;ref name="ABC Tampa"&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}{{cite news | url=http://www.wfts.com/video/news/2006/05/0528health.shtml | title=ABC Tampa's Linda Hurtado reports Florida congressman urges FDA to investigate Baby Gender Mentor and similar products; Florida attorney general investigates Acu-Gen | publisher=[[WFTS]] | accessdate=January 19, 2007 | format=WMV |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061116160620/http://www.wfts.com/video/news/2006/05/0528health.shtml |archivedate = November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A law firm named Gainey &amp; McKenna has filed a [[class action]] lawsuit&lt;ref name="BGI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.babygenderinvestigation.com/ | title=Welcome to BabyGenderInvestigation.com | publisher=BabyGenderInvestigation.com | accessdate=January 16, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070115064621/http://www.babygenderinvestigation.com/| archivedate= 15 January 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at least one other firm is inviting people to contact them about their [[legal rights]] if they are unhappy with the results of their test.{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref name="WLOCP"&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}{{cite web | title=Baby Gender Mentor / Acu-Gen | publisher=Wiliams Love O'Leary Craine and Powers P.C.

==Possible uses for test==
Parents have cited an interest in preparing themselves or the baby's siblings for [[Gender role|gender-specific]] issues.&lt;ref name="USNews"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/050624/24sex.htm |title=Sex Matters: Baby's gender: no longer a secret? |work=US News and World Report |date=June 24, 2005 |accessdate=January 16, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224130327/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/050624/24sex.htm |archivedate=24 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women might prefer this test to an ultrasound exam, which might reveal fetal abnormalities that the parents might prefer not to know about until after delivery.

===Concerns about sex selection===
The National Public Radio investigative report on Acu-Gen predicted that parents may use the Baby Gender Mentor test as a basis for determining whether to get a [[sex-selective abortion]].&lt;ref name="Boyce2" /&gt; [[KMSP-TV]] interviewed [[Genetic counseling|genetic counselor]] Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction.{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref name="Fox9"&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}{{cite news |url=http://www.kmsp.com/news/health/story.asp?1649175 |title=Baby Gender Mentor |publisher=Fox9 News |year=2006 |accessdate=July 17, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315001929/http://www.kmsp.com/news/health/story.asp?1649175 |archive-date=2006-03-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concern is that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. [[Americans United for Life]] argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early. They say that women who want to have a specific sex will be learning the results at a time when it is safer for them to have an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |title=Revolutionary foetus sex test raises eugenics fears |author=Langton, James |work=Daily Telegraph |date= October 7, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website for the PregnancyStore.com says that they will ship the tests only within the United States,{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref name="PregStore"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnancystore.com/baby_gender_mentor.htm |title=Baby Gender Mentor Home DNA Gender Testing Kit |publisher=The PregnancyStore.com |accessdate=July 18, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705201351/http://pregnancystore.com/baby_gender_mentor.htm |archivedate=July 5, 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila McLean]], professor of [[medical ethics]] at [[Glasgow University]], is critical of the kits.

===Alleged use for medical diagnoses===
Acu-Gen's website states the test was not a medical test:
{{cquote|Acu-Gen Biolab, Inc. (“Acu-Gen”) and the www.babygendermentor.com website (“Web Site”) do not offer medical advice or professional services. The products and information provided with the Baby Gender Mentor Test ''cannot'' and ''should not'' be used for diagnosing or treating a known or suspected health condition or illness. The Baby Gender Mentor Test is ''not'' a substitute for medical or professional care. If you have, or you suspect that you or your baby may have, a health condition or illness, you should consult with your doctor. Never disregard medical or professional care or advice or delay seeking it because of something you have learned from Acu-Gen, the Baby Gender Mentor Test or our Web Site.

The content of our Web Site is provided on an "as is" basis.&lt;ref name="Things"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://babygendermentor.com/information.php?information_id=2 |title=Things you must know |publisher=BabyGenderMentor.com |accessdate=January 21, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202120941/http://babygendermentor.com/information.php?information_id=2 |archivedate=2007-02-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tests similar to the Baby Gender Mentor test can be used for medical diagnoses. For instance, scientists have shown that it is possible to use fetal DNA from a woman's blood to screen the fetus for [[Genetic disorder|genetic defects]] such as [[Down syndrome]]. In a validation study sponsored by the National Institute for Child Health and Development, 5 different labs used fetal cells from maternal blood to search for evidence of Down syndrome in 2,744 pregnancies. On average, the labs correctly spotted Down syndrome babies 74% of the time.&lt;ref name="Science-Mag" /&gt;

In at least one case, Chang Wang, the president of Acu-Gen, has phoned a pregnant woman one month after giving her the sex prediction to inform her that her test indicated an "excess of [[genetic material]] in her blood" and advised her to see her doctor in order "to rule out problems like Down's syndrome or Trisomy 18". Wang explains this means "with a certain possibility, that her fetus has a kind of genetic problem. Of course later on, we had used our technology to prove that she has a chromosome problem: [[Edwards syndrome|Trisomy 18]]. That means that this baby [is] going to have a developmental problem and is going to probably cease to exist right after the birth." Dr. Diana Bianchi of Tufts disputes the possibility of the test being used for such a diagnosis. She says, "The test involves looking at genetic sequences on the [[X chromosome]] and the Y chromosome. If he gave a diagnosis of Trisomy 18, that involves a different chromosome, [[Chromosome 18]]. That is certainly something that is not advertised in the packaging associated with the test. "It is possible that, upon being told of a problem by Acu-Gen, a woman may seek to have an amniocentesis or other [[invasive (medical)|invasive procedure]] which may be an unnecessary risk if the Acu-Gen diagnosis was in error.&lt;ref name="NJSL"&gt;{{cite news |title=Prenatal test reveals more than gender |work=The Star-Ledger|date=October 31, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the woman delivered a healthy baby free from both Trisomy 18 and Down syndrome.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The class action lawsuit filed by Gainey &amp; McKenna alleges that Acu-Gen is improperly dispensing medical advice. The law firm claims Wang has contacted "many women" and advised them that their fetuses have chromosomal abnormalities. They claim that Dr. Wang, who is listed as a Ph.D., is providing women "with all sorts of medical advice and diagnoses". They say their clients have suffered great [[Negligent infliction of emotional distress|emotional distress]] and have undergone unnecessary medical testing based upon Dr. Wang's "advice".&lt;ref name="Allegations"/&gt;

==Warranty and availability==
Acu-Gen has allegedly created new requirements for people who want to take advantage of the money-back guarantee.{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2009}}&lt;!--this is a commercial sales blog--&gt;&lt;ref name="balks"&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2009}}{{cite web | url=http://www.in-gender.com/cs/blogs/Gender_Selection_News/archive/2005/12/29/4559.aspx | title=Acu-Gen balks at giving refunds for birth certificates showing Baby Gender Mentor was wrong |  publisher=InGender.com | date=December 30, 2005 | accessdate=January 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attorney Barry Gainey, of Gainey &amp; McKenna, says that Chang Wang, Acu-Gen's President, is "making people send in the original [[birth certificate]]. He's making them get blood tests from the [[Infant|newborn baby]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} And there's other requirements that he's now adding to the refund in order to avoid paying back these people and giving them the 200-percent refund."  None of those requirements were on the boxes shipped to early customers, but the requirements have since appeared on Acu-Gen's website.&lt;ref name="Parents sue"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=1668125 | title=ABC News: Parents Sue Over Pregnancy Test Said to Tell Baby's Sex | author=Zand M.D., Sarvenaz|date=February 26, 2006 | accessdate=January 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gainey has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of 40&amp;nbsp;people who claim they received inaccurate results but were unable to obtain refunds from Acu-Gen.&lt;ref name="Parents sue"/&gt;

There have been conflicting reports about how often the company has refunded money to consumers who received an erroneous result with the test.  In February 2006, Wang said, "We don't mistakes {{sic}}. Period."{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref name="ABC2"&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}{{cite news | title=Experts call for regulation of baby gender tests | url=http://www.wfts.com/stories/2006/02/060220babyfolo.shtml | publisher=ABC Action News—Tampa | date=February 20, 2006 | accessdate=January 16, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060314164342/http://www.wfts.com/stories/2006/02/060220babyfolo.shtml |archivedate = March 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in October 2005 he had stated his company had issued four refund checks, including one for a case involving a vanishing twin.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; The PregnancyStore.com states that none of the refund checks were issued as a result of the test being proven wrong by a [[live birth (human)|live birth]].  Their website states:
{{cquote|To date, Acu-Gen has issued 200% refund checks to a few customers—NOT for incorrectly identifying the baby's gender at birth, though. Two are for cases involving vanishing twins, one case due to insufficient blood sample, two cases caused by incomplete reactions and three reversal cases of no obvious reasons. All of these eight cases are currently into their second trimester of pregnancy.{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref name="NW-reply"&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}{{cite web | url=http://www.pregnancystore.com/in_the_news.htm#NewsweekArticle |title=Pregnancy Store.com in the news! | publisher=PregnancyStore.com | accessdate=July 18, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614104433/http://pregnancystore.com/in_the_news.htm#NewsweekArticle |archivedate = June 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In March 2006, Wang wrote in an [[e-mail]] to NPR, he has "decided to defer all his energies regarding the BGM product and service for one more year, when results of actual births compared to the results provided by Baby Gender Mentor should answer any concern about the accuracy of the test."&lt;ref name="Revisit" /&gt;

Initial news reports and the Acu-Gen website touted a 200% money-back guarantee.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt; In May 2006, Baby Gender Mentor website was modified to show a different warranty than the one that had originally promised to refund 200% of the purchase price of the test.  The new warranty states:

==About Acu-Gen==
Acu-Gen is a biotech company in Lowell, Massachusetts and is led by Chang-ning Wang, the company's President.  A National Public Radio reporter visited the address given as the headquarters of Acu-Gen in September 2005.  They found that the building at that address contains a [[Hindu|Hindu temple]] and a company called [[BioTronics]], but no sign for Acu-Gen.  According to NPR, their inquiries at BioTronics revealed the two companies have common ownership, but no one was available to comment for the NPR story.&lt;ref name="Boyce2" /&gt;  Acu-Gen does not mention a direct link to [[BioTronics]] in their marketing materials.  However, they do state on their web-site that they utilize BioTronics' [[BioTronics|AmpliSensor]] technology, according to the Baby Gender Mentor website.&lt;ref name="BGM-Science"/&gt; AmpliSensor is a [[quantitative PCR]] assay invented by Wang and marketed by BioTronics, according to the Baby Gender Mentor website.&lt;ref name="BGM-Science"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}{{cite web | url=http://www.biotech-register.com/listcogo.cfm?state=MA&amp;company=Biotronics%5ECorporation&amp;defn=POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION&amp;code=ASSA%20POJH | title=Biotronics corporation | publisher=Biotech-register.com | accessdate=January 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A news crew from television station [[WFTS]], an [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) affiliate, visited the Acu-Gen offices in February 2006.  They found "about six employees inside Wang's lab, some putting together sex test kits, others doing some type of lab work. There was a room full of machines Chang said he created, and shelves stacked with blood samples supposedly sent in by women from across the United States."  BioTronics does make a [[Laboratory equipment|laboratory instrument]] known as an AG-9600 AmpliSensor Analyzer, which is used for [[quantitative property|quantitative]] DNA analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|6033854}}  Full text at:{{cite web | url=http://www.patentgenius.com/patent/6033854.html | title=U.S. Patent No 6,033,854—Quantitative PCR using blocking oligonucleotides | work=PatentGenius.com |author1=Kurnit, DM |author2=Chiang PW |author3=Wang CNJ. |date=March 7, 2000 | accessdate=January 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known whether the two journalists visited the same address, nor is it known whether Acu-Gen and BioTronics currently share office or laboratory space.

'''Christopher Darren Green''' (born 1959) is professor of [[psychology]] at [[York University]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada.  He is cross-appointed to the graduate [[science and technology studies]] program as well. His research has mostly been about the [[history of psychology]], though he now also writes on methodological and statistical issues in psychology.

Green was a Fellow of the [[American Psychological Association]] until he resigned from the organization in 2015. He is a past president of APA Division 26, the [[Society for the History of Psychology]]. He was editor of the ''[[Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences]]'', 2006-2008. His graduate training was in psychological [[aesthetics]] and computational [[cognitive science]].

==Early life==
Green was born in [[Sacramento]], California in 1959. His father, a native of [[San Francisco]], was an undergraduate student of [[English studies|English]] and [[drama]] at the time.  His mother was born in Ohio and raised near [[Detroit]], Michigan, and she moved to California in the early 1950s.

The year after his birth, Green's family moved [[Salt Lake City]], Utah, where his father worked at an explosives plant for two years. The plant suffered a catastrophic explosion in 1962, and the family moved back to the [[San Francisco]] Bay Area, living in the suburbs in the south of the city. His father earned an MA at [[San Jose State University]], then went to the doctoral program in drama at [[Stanford University]] in 1970. Green attended [[Lewis M. Terman]] Jr. High School (now [[Palo Alto Unified School District#Terman Middle School|Terman Middle School]]) for grades 7 through 9. He played trumpet in a variety of student bands and orchestras.

In 1974, his father took a professorship at [[Bishop's University]] in [[Lennoxville, Québec]]. Green attended [[Alexander Galt Regional High School]] there for grades 10 and 11. He also learned several trades around the university's theater, doing set-building, lighting, and sound. In 1976, Green moved to the Montréal area to attend [[Vanier CEGEP]] where he earned a Diplôme d'études collégiales (DEC) in music with a specialization in jazz.

Starting in 1979, he enrolled in music at [[McGill University]]. By the end of the year, however, he had become disenchanted with the department and with his future prospects as a professional musician. He transferred to the department of psychology and discovered an interest in cognitive psychology, in which he took a course from [http://web.uvic.ca/psyc/marley/ Tony Marley]. He also took a course in symbolic logic from  [http://www.philosophy.pitt.edu/person/anil-gupta Anil Gupta]. Green was also a disk jockey at the student radio station.

After one year in psychology, Green dropped out of university. He busked guitar in a subway station. During the summer of 1982, he moved back to his parents' home in Lennoxville and enrolled at Bishop's University to finish his psychology degree. His honours thesis supervisor was Anton DeMan. Another of his primary mentors was Stuart McKelvie.  Green also worked in the theater, served as copy editor for the student newspaper (''The Campus'') and, in his second year, was elected president of the Bishop's Student Council. He completed his degree in 1984 and applied to several graduate programs in psychology, but was not accepted. He decided to remain at Bishop's for the 1984-85 school year, where he spent most of his time working as a lighting and sound assistant at the university theater. He was the sound operator for a concert played by the legendary blues musician, [[Brownie McGhee]], who teamed up with a local man, Harmonica Zeke, for a one-night show. Green also wrote a political column for ''The Campus'' under the pseudonym "#9."

==Graduate education==

After his additional year at Bishop's, Green applied to graduate school again, this time in both psychology and theater. He was accepted at [[Simon Fraser University]] in psychology and at the [[University of Victoria]] in theater. He chose the former.
Beginning at Simon Fraser in 1985, Green's MA supervisor was Bernard Lyman, who admired the ''[[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]]'' psychologists and sought to revive [[E. B. Titchener]]'s method of rigorous introspection. In addition to the required psychology courses, Green took several philosophy courses (aesthetics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of science) during his master's degree. His thesis research involved factor analyzing hundreds of subjects' detailed responses to nine different art works (3 paintings, 3 pieces of music, 3 poems). Nothing from the thesis was ever published, but the research process brought to Green's attention the [[Golden Section]], a topic that would later serve as the basis of his most-cited journal article. Considering the possibility of specializing in statistics, Green took several math courses at the start of his PhD. He had begun writing his major doctoral essays (on philosophy of science and psychology) when his supervisor, Lyman, became ill with cancer, dying in December 1988.

Green transferred to the [[University of Toronto]], where his new doctoral supervisor, [http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~kennedy/ John M. Kennedy], a one-time student of [[J. J. Gibson]], was just beginning pioneering work on whether blind people use the same graphical artistic conventions when they draw. Green became interested in computational cognitive science and audited courses in [[connectionism]] taught by [[Geoffrey Hinton]]. One of his closest mentors at Toronto was the theoretical psychologist, [https://www.amazon.com/André-Kukla/e/B001IZVE9C André Kukla]. His dissertation topic, conceived during a conference talk he saw by [[Paul Smolensky]], was to develop connectionist networks that could correctly solve problems in deductive logic. He completed his PhD in 1992.

==Career==

Finding no full-time academic position immediately after graduation, Green remained at Toronto, where he was given the title of "Special Lecturer" and taught various courses, including one in a recently developed cognitive science program. In 1992 he published a paper on the history of operationism, which had grown out of his unfinished doctoral papers at Simon Fraser and was, for many years, among his most popular articles. He applied for dozens more academic positions the following year, mostly in cognition. He was hired by [[York University]] in Toronto in July 1993. He joined York's History &amp; Theory of Psychology graduate program (now Historical, Theoretical, &amp; Critical Studies in Psychology). He taught undergraduate courses mainly on cognition, perception, statistics, and the history of psychology. At the graduate level, he taught seminars on cognition, the history of psychology, and the work of Michel Foucault. Starting about 1997, his undergraduate teaching narrowed to only statistics. In 1995, he published a review of psychological research on the aesthetics of the Golden Section, which soon became his most-cited article. Among Green's most important mentors during his early years at York were [[Raymond Fancher]], the senior figure in the History &amp; Theory of Psychology program, and [[Andrew Winston]], a historian of psychology at the [[University of Guelph]].

He became interested in the World Wide Web and created a series of webpages and e-mail lists for several scholarly organizations in which he was involved: Divisions 24 (theory) and 26 (history) of the [[American Psychological Association]], Cheiron: The International Society for the History of Behavioral and Social Sciences, the International Society for Theoretical Psychology, and Section 25 (history &amp; philosophy) of the [[Canadian Psychological Association]], among others. He was tenured and promoted to Associate Professor in 1997.  Late in 1997, he began work on the [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca "Classics in the History of Psychology"] website, which ultimately housed electronic editions of over 200 publications of historical importance in psychology. The site became tremendously popular, especially in the days before commercial publishers learned the value of posting their journals' back-catalogs to the Web. The Classics site garnered tens of millions of hits during its first few years. Green was made a Fellow of the American Psychological Association (through the History Division (26)) in 2000, primarily for his internet activities. He was also presented a Special Service Award by History Division (26) of the APA in 2002.  In 2004, he was made a Fellow of the Teaching Division (2) of APA as well. He was promoted to Full Professor by York that same year.

In 1998, Green had returned to the University of Toronto to start a second PhD, in the philosophy of science. His supervisor was a professor he had known during his previous stint there, [[William Seager (philosopher)|William Seager]],  best known for his work on the theory of consciousness. Progress on the dissertation was slow, but he completed the degree in 2004. His dissertation returned to the topic of cognitive science, investigating whether connectionist networks served as "scientific models," as that phrase is understood in philosophy. He showed that one popular class of connectionist networks, which are made up of units that are usually thought of as being idealized analogs of neurons (thus the nickname "neural nets"), seemed to perform worse rather than better as more realistic neurological assumptions were built into their operation.

Having more or less satisfied his interests in computational cognitive science, in the first years of the 21st century Green began to retool as a historian of science. First, he wrote a couple of pieces on the mid-19th-century computational work of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. In 2003, he finally published a [https://books.google.ca/books/about/Early_Psychological_Thought.html?id=WTh-AAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y book on ancient Greek and Roman psychological thought] that he had co-authored with a graduate school friend, [[Philip Groff]], mostly during the mid-1990s. After that, his main historical interests turned to North American psychology, especially around the turn of the 20th century. He worked on the rise and fall of Functionalism, creating two video documentaries on the topic in addition to several articles and book chapters. In October and November 2006, he wrote the bulk of [[English Wikipedia]]'s [[history of psychology]] entry. In 2009, he co-edited with [[Ludy T. Benjamin, Jr.]] a [http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/nebraska/9780803222267/ book on the pre-history of sport psychology].  From 2006 to 2008 he served as editor of the [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15206696 ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'']. Late in 2007, he was elected President-Elect of the History of Division of the APA, serving as President mainly in 2009.

About 2010, he began using the new digital methods that were starting to capture various regions of the humanities and applying them to the study of the history of psychology. In 2011, he formed a "laboratory" with his York colleague, [[Michael Pettit]] and a number of students. They named themselves the "PsyBorgs." In 2012, Green and Pettit won a research grant from the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada]] (SSHRC) to support this work. Green and his colleagues published several articles in which complete runs of journal articles over decades of time were represented as nodes in a series of networks. These networks visually depicted the intellectual structure of the discipline at various periods in time — e.g., which topics were popular, how various topics were related to each other in terms of the vocabularies they used, and how these disciplinary structures changed over time from the 1880s to the 1920s. He also co-authored with his students digital studies of history's most prolific and most influential psychologists. In August of 2019, the book that he had been working for nearly a decade was published, [https://www.rouledge.com/Psychology-and-Its-Cities-A-New-History-of-Early-American-Psychology/Green/p/book/9781138059436 ''Psychology and Its Cities: A New History of Early American Psychology'']. His current research is focused on the historical use and misuse of statistical analysis in psychology.

Green's most active (former) graduate students include Daniel Denis (currently at the [[University of Montana]]), Jennifer Bazar (currently at the [[Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital|Lakeshore Grounds]] Interpretive Centre of [[Humber College]]), Cathy Faye (currently at the [[University of Akron]]), Jeremy Burman (currently at the [[University of Groningen]] in the Netherlands), Jacy Young (currently at [[Quest University]]), and Arlie Belliveau (currently at [[York University]]).

{{Expert-subject|philosophy|WikiProject|talk=Major inadequacies -- For the intrepid expert|reason=the article does not provide an adequate portrayal of the philosophical literature on this issue|date=March 2015}}
{{one source|talk=Single source|date=June 2017}}

In [[epistemology]], '''criteria of truth''' (or '''tests of truth''') are standards and rules used to judge the accuracy of statements and claims. They are tools of verification. Understanding a [[philosophy]]'s criteria of [[truth]] is fundamental to a clear evaluation of that philosophy. This necessity is driven by the varying, and conflicting, claims of different philosophies. The rules of [[logic]] have no ability to distinguish truth on their own. An individual must determine what standards distinguish truth from [[Falsity|falsehood]]. Not all criteria are equally valid. Some standards are sufficient, while others are questionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sahakian|first=William|author2=Mabel Lewis Sahakian|year=1993|title= Ideas of the Great Philosophers|publisher=Barnes and Noble|isbn=1-56619-271-4|pages=3&amp;ndash;4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criteria listed represent those most commonly used by scholars and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Dolhenty states there seem to be only three functional, effective tests of truth. He lists these as the correspondence, coherence and pragmatic [[theories of truth]].&lt;ref name="dolhenty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themoralliberal.com/theradicalacademy/2011/08/17/truth-and-certainty/ |title=Truth and Certainty |accessdate=2007-10-31 |last=Dolhenty |first=Jonathan |work= The Problem of Knowledge: A brief introduction to epistemology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authority==
{{See also|Appeal to authority}}
The opinions of those with significant experience, highly trained or possessing an advanced degree are often considered a form of [[logical argument|proof]]. Their [[knowledge]] and familiarity within a given field or area of knowledge command respect and allow their statements to be criteria of truth. A person may not simply declare themselves an authority, but rather must be properly qualified. Despite the wide respect given to [[expert testimony]], it is not an infallible criterion. For example, multiple authorities may conflict in their claims and conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 8&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coherence==
{{See also|Coherence theory of truth}}
Coherence refers to a consistent and overarching explanation for all facts. To be coherent, all pertinent facts must be arranged in a consistent and cohesive fashion as an integrated whole. The theory that most effectively reconciles all facts in this fashion may be considered most likely to be true. Coherence is the most potentially effective test of truth because it most adequately addresses all elements. The main limitation lies not in the standard, but in the [[fallibility|human inability]] to acquire all facts of an experience. Only an [[omniscient]] mind could be aware of all of the relevant information. A scholar must accept this limitation and accept as true the most coherent explanation for the available facts. Coherence is difficult to dispute as a criterion of truth, since arguing against coherence is validating incoherence, which is inherently illogical.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 10&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consensus gentium==
{{See also|Argumentum ad populum}}
Some view opinions held by all people to be valid criteria of truth. According to ''consensus gentium'', the universal consent of all mankind, all humans holding a distinct belief proves it is true. There is some value in the criterion if it means innate truth, such as the laws of logic and [[mathematics]]. If it merely means agreement, as in a unanimous vote, its value is questionable. For example, general assent once held the [[flat earth|earth was flat]] and that the [[geocentricism|sun revolved about the earth]].&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p7&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consistency (mere)==
Mere [[Consistency proof|consistency]] is when correct statements do not contradict, but are not necessarily related. Accordingly, an individual is consistent if he does not contradict himself. It is inadequate as a criterion because it treats facts in an isolated fashion without true cohesion and integration; nevertheless it remains a [[necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary condition]] for the truth of any argument, owing to the [[law of noncontradiction]]. The value of a proof largely lies in its ability to reconcile individual facts into a coherent whole.&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p10&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consistency (strict)==
Strict consistency is when claims are connected in such a fashion that one statement follows from another. [[Formal system|Formal logic]] and mathematical rules are examples of rigorous consistency. An example would be: [[multiple modus ponens|if all As are Bs and all Bs are Cs, then all As are Cs]]. While this standard is of high value, it is limited. For example, the premises are ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' (or self-apparent), requiring another test of truth to employ this criterion. Additionally, strict consistency may produce results lacking coherence and completeness. While a philosophical system may demonstrate rigorous consistency with the facts it considers, all facts must be taken into consideration for an adequate criterion of truth, regardless of their detriment to any given system.&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p10/&gt;

==Correspondence==
{{See also|Correspondence theory of truth}}
{{See also|Scientific method}}
Correspondence is quite simply when a claim corresponds with its object. For example, the claim that the White House is in Washington, D.C. is true, if the White House is actually located in Washington. Correspondence is held by many philosophers to be the most valid of the criteria of truth. An idea that corresponds to its object is indeed true, but determining if the correspondence is perfect requires additional tests of truth. This indicates that correspondence is a perfectly valid ''definition'' of truth, but is not of itself a valid criterion of truth. An additional test beyond this "definition" is required to determine the precise degree of similarity between what is posited and what exists in [[objective reality]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Custom==
Most people consciously or unknowingly employ [[Norm (sociology)|custom]] as a criterion of truth, based on the assumption that doing what is customary will prevent error. It is particularly applied in the determination of moral truth and reflected in the statement "when in Rome, do as the Romans do". People stick closely to the principle of custom when they use common vernacular, wear common fashions and so forth; essentially, when they do what is [[Mainstream (terminology)|popular]]. Custom is not considered a serious, or valid, test of truth. For example, public opinion polls do not determine truth.&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p4&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotions==
Many people allow feelings to determine judgment, often in the face of contrary evidence or without even attempting to collect evidence and facts. They are implicitly accepting [[emotions]] as a criterion of truth. Most people will admit that feelings are not an adequate test for truth. For example, a seasoned businessman will put aside his emotions and search for the best available facts when making an investment. Similarly, scholars are trained to put aside such [[Qualia|subjective]] judgments when evaluating knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotions are real, however, and thus must be considered within any social scientific system of coherence.

==Instinct==
The existence of distinct [[instinct]]s has long been debated. Proponents of instinct argue that we eat because of hunger, drink because of thirst, and so forth. Some have even argued for the existence of God based on this criterion, arguing that the object of every instinct has a referent in reality. The counterpoint of hunger is food; for thirst it is liquid; for the sex drive it is a mate. Instincts are not accepted as a reliable test because they are most often indistinct, variant and difficult to define. Additionally, universal instincts are so few that they offer little to the greater body of philosophy as a criterion.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 5&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intuition==
[[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] is an assumed truth with an unknown, or possibly unexamined, source. It is a judgment that is not dependent on a [[Rationality|rational]] examination of the facts. It is usually experienced as a sudden sensation and/or rush of thoughts that feel "right". Many persons experience intuitive epiphanies which later prove to be true. Scholars have sometimes come upon valid theories and proofs while daydreaming or otherwise mentally occupied with something bearing no apparent relationship to the truth they seek to reveal. Intuition is at best a source for truths, rather than a criterion with which to evaluate them. Intuitive knowledge requires testing by means of other criteria of truth in order to confirm its accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Majority rule==
[[Majority rule]] is a statistical method of accepting assertions and proposals. In [[democracy|democratic systems]], majority rule is used to determine group decisions, particularly those relating to personal [[morality]] and [[social behavior]]. Some systems divided into several oppositional factions may depend on mere [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]]. While majority rule may make for a good democratic system, it is a poor determinant of truth, subject to the criticisms of the broad version of ''[[consensus gentium]]''.&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p7/&gt;

==Naïve realism==
[[Naïve realism]] posits that only that which is directly observable by the [[human senses]] is true. First-hand observation determines the truth or falsity of a given statement. Naïve Realism is an insufficient criterion of truth. A host of natural phenomena are demonstrably true, but not observable by the unaided sense. For example, Naïve Realism would deny the existence of [[ultrasound|sounds beyond the range of human hearing]] and the existence of [[x-rays]]. Similarly, there are a number of sense experiments which show a disconnect between the perceived sensation and the reality of its cause.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 7&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pragmatic==
{{See also|Pragmatic theory of truth}}
{{See also|Scientific method}}
If an idea works then it must be true, to the Pragmatist. The consequences of applying a concept reveal its [[truth value]] upon examination of the results. The full meaning of an idea is self-apparent in its application. For example, the therapeutic value and effect of penicillin in relation to infections is proven in its administration. Although [[Pragmatism]] is considered a valuable criterion, it must be used with caution and reservation, due to its potential for false positives. For example, a doctor may prescribe a patient medication for an illness, but it could later turn out that a placebo is equally effective. Thus, untrue concepts could appear to be working contrary to the purpose of the pragmatic test. However, it has validity as a test, particularly in the form [[William Ernest Hocking]] called "Negative Pragmatism". In essence, it states that ideas that do not work cannot possibly be true, though ideas which do work may or may not be true.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas of the Great Philosophers'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revelation==
The principal distinction between intuition and [[revelation]] is that revelation has an assumed source: [[God]] (or another higher power). Revelation may be defined as truth emanating from God. Many [[religion]]s fundamentally rely on revelation as a test of truth. This criterion is subject to the same criticisms as intuition. It may be a valid reference of truth for an individual, but it is inadequate for providing a coherent proof of the knowledge to others.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 6&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time==
Time is a criterion commonly appealed to in debate, often referred to as "[[the test of time]]". This criterion posits that over time erroneous beliefs and logical errors will be revealed, while if the belief is true, the mere passage of time cannot adversely affect its [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Time is an inadequate test for truth, since it is subject to similar flaws as custom and tradition (which are simply specific variations of the time factor). Many demonstrably false beliefs have endured for centuries and even millennia (e.g. [[vitalism]]). It is commonly rejected as a valid criterion. For example, most people will not convert to another faith simply because the other religion is centuries (or even millennia) older than their current beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian &amp; Sahakian, ''Ideas'', pp. 4&amp;ndash;5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tradition==
[[Tradition]], closely related to custom, is the standard stating that which is held for generations is true. Those accepting tradition argue that ideas gaining the loyalty multiple generations possesses a measure of credibility. Tradition possesses many of the same failings as custom. It is possible for falsehoods to be passed down from generation to generation, since tradition generally emphasizes repetition over [[critical thinking|critical evaluation]].&lt;ref name=sahakian1993p4/&gt;

'''David Gauthier''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|g|ɔː|t|i|eɪ}}; born 10 September 1932) is a Canadian-American [[philosopher]] best known for his neo-[[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] [[social contract|social contract (contractarian) theory]] of [[morality]], as developed in his 1986 book ''Morals by Agreement''.

==Life and career==
Gauthier was born in Toronto in 1932 and educated at the [[University of Toronto]] (B.A. (Hons.), 1954), [[Harvard University]] (A.M., 1955), and the [[University of Oxford]] (B.Phil., 1957; D.Phil., 1961).&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

He taught at the [[University of Toronto]] from 1958 until 1980, when he joined the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where he is now Distinguished Service Professor emeritus.

Gauthier has also held visiting appointments at UCLA, UC Berkeley, Princeton, UC Irvine, and the University of Waterloo.

In 1979, he was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] (F.R.S.C.).

==Philosophy&lt;!--'Constrained maximization', 'Constrained maximisation', and 'Contractarian ethics' redirect here--&gt;==
Gauthier is the author of numerous articles, some of the most important of which are collected in ''Moral Dealing'', as well as several books including ''Practical Reasoning'', ''The Logic of Leviathan'', ''Morals by Agreement'', and ''Rousseau: The Sentiment of Existence''.

In addition to systematic work in moral theory, Gauthier is also interested in the [[history of political philosophy]], especially [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]. He has also done work on the theory of [[Practical reasoning|practical rationality]], where he begins from an attempt to understand economic rationality, rather than from [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] or [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] antecedents.

Gauthier understands [[value theory|value]] as a matter of individuals' [[economic subjectivism|subjective]] preferences, and argues that moral constraints on straightforward utility-maximizing are [[prudence|prudentially]] justified. He argues that it is most prudent to give up straightforward maximizing and instead adopt a disposition of '''constrained maximization'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, according to which one resolves to cooperate with all similarly disposed persons (those disposed towards cooperation) and defect on the rest (straightforward maximizers), since repeated cooperation provides greater yields than repeated mutual defection from contracts (as is seen in a basic [[Prisoner's dilemma]] game). According to Gauthier's '''contractarian ethics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Byrne, ''The Philosophical and Theological Foundations of Ethics'', Springer, 2016, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; moral constraints are justified because they make us all better off, in terms of our preferences (whatever they may be). A consequence is that good moral thinking is just an elevated and subtly [[game theory|strategic]] version of [[Instrumental rationality|means–end reasoning]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4300">'''Eutaxiology''' (from the Greek ''eu'' – good, and ''tax'' – order) is the philosophical study of order and design.  It is distinguished from [[teleology]] in that it does not focus on the purpose or goal of a given structure or process, merely the degree and complexity of the structure or process.

==History==

The term "eutaxiology" was first coined by geologist [[Lewis Ezra Hicks]] in his ''Critique of Design Arguments'', in which he argued that one can appreciate the complexities of organic life on [[Earth]] without assuming and accepting an [[intelligent design]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Lewis Ezra, ''A Critique of Design Arguments''. Boston: Franklin Press, 1883. [https://archive.org/details/critiqueofdesign00hick Online at archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the concept had been around for centuries, most notably in the works of [[Aristotle]], who offered in ''Physics'' the idea of natural design without a designer, stating that "It is absurd to suppose that ends are not present [in nature] because we do not see an agent deliberating".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''The Organon and Other Works''. Opensource collection. Translated under the editorship of W.D. Ross. Full text at Internet Archive (archive.org). p. 649 in text. n647 in page field. https://archive.org/details/AristotleOrganon. Retrieved 2009-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lucretius]], who was also a supporter of [[Accidentalism (philosophy)|accidentalism]], similarly stated in ''De Rerum Natura,'' "Nothing in the body is made in order that we may use it. What happens to exist is the cause of its use".&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius. ''On the Nature of Things: De rerum natura''. [[Anthony M. Esolen]], transl. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Univ. Pr., 1995. {{ISBN|0-8018-5055-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teleology==

Eutaxiology is often mistaken for teleology, the study of purpose and design.  However, it can be argued that eutaxiology and teleology are in fact complements to each other by stating that a good design and order necessarily implies the ability to achieve a goal or purpose.  The two terms are also often used as arguments against each other, implying that eutaxiology is the observation of a process that occurs by chance, while teleology is always designed by some designer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Nagel|Nagel, Ernest]]. ''Teleology''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==

As a result, the eutaxiology is often used in religious arguments, particularly concerning the existence of [[God]], though it is used in both sides of the argument.  In complement with teleology, it can be argued that the basic principles of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] are designed in a way that supports organic life.  On the other hand, skeptics point to [[evolutionary biology]], claiming that if the Earth were perfectly designed by a perfect creator, the long and sometimes unsuccessful process of evolution would not have had to have taken place.  Critics of this theory claim that evolutionary biology is in fact evidence of intelligent design and therefore God, pointing to the eventual development of the human brain, which could engineer society.&lt;ref&gt;Corey, Michael Anthony. ''God and the New Cosmology''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

In this regard, eutaxiology can also be applied to [[ethics]], especially concerning ends justifying means, and whether or not ends do in fact depend on means.  On a larger scale, eutaxiology can be used to argue either for or against [[Anthropic Principle]].  On one hand, it can be stated that observations made about the physical and metaphysical [[Universe]] must be compatible with the life observed in it.  For example, people believe that the Universe was especially designed for them because they cannot fathom other, completely different Universes, implying existential epistemic eutaxiology.  Conversely, It can be said that due to [[Occam's Razor]], the universe must be especially designed for humans because of the intricacies of the design that allows us to live where and how we do.  Metaphysically, this can be traced back to causal arguments (i.e. do humans exist because of intricate biochemical processes, or do they exist because God created these biochemical processes?)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9419">The '''exhausted combination doctrine''', also referred to as the '''doctrine of the''' '''''Lincoln Engineering''''' '''case''', is the doctrine of [[U.S. patent law]] that when an inventor invents a [[novelty (patent)|new]], [[non-obviousness|unobvious]] device and seeks to patent not merely the new device but also the combination of the new device with a known, conventional device with which the new device cooperates in the conventional and predictable way in which devices of those types have previously cooperated, the combination is unpatentable as an "exhausted combination" or "old combination".&lt;ref&gt;For example, consider the invention of a new microprocessor, which is patentable in its own right. Suppose that the inventor seeks to patent computers containing the new microprocessor, where the microprocessor cooperates with the other elements of the computers in the same conventional way that microprocessors have previously cooperated with the other elements of computers. The computer with the new microprocessor would be an exhausted combination. This hypothetical case is based on the facts of the recent [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]'', 128 S. Ct. 2109 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  The doctrine is also termed the doctrine of the ''Lincoln Engineering'' case because the [[United States Supreme Court]] explained the doctrine in its decision in ''Lincoln Engineering Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/303/545/case.html Justia] and [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=303&amp;invol=545 FindLaw], 303 U.S. 545 (1938)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Lincoln Engineering'' decision==
In ''Lincoln Engineering'', the inventor invented a new and improved coupling device to attach a nozzle to a grease gun. The patent, however, [[claim (patent)|claim]]ed the whole combination of grease gun, nozzle, and coupling.  The Supreme Court stated that "the improvement of one part of an old combination gives no right to claim that improvement in combination with other old parts which perform no new function in the combination".&lt;ref&gt;303 U.S. at 549-50.&lt;/ref&gt; It then concluded that the inventor's "effort, by the use of a combination claim, to extend the monopoly of his invention of an improved form of chuck or coupler to old parts or elements having no new function when operated in connection with the coupler renders the claim void."&lt;ref&gt;303 U.S. at 552.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This way of claiming an invention was termed “overclaiming,” because it inflated the royalty base for licensing and potentially effectuated a [[tie-in]] by means of which the patentee required users, for example, to purchase not only the couplings but the whole grease gun as well in order to use the invention.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=LFIMX6L-nMUC&amp;pg=PT238&amp;lpg=PT238&amp;dq=overclaiming+patent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R3lPZqoxw1&amp;sig=qpu4MeL18AMLeLdW9mNz9JmZrz4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPT238,M1 ''Landis on Mechanics of Patent Claim Drafting''] § 8:4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Is the ''Lincoln Engineering'' doctrine obsolete?==
The Federal Circuit held in 1984 that this doctrine is outdated and no longer reflects the law.&lt;ref&gt;See Radio Steel &amp; Mfg. Co. v. MTD Products, Inc., 731 F.2d 840, 845 (Fed. Cir. 1984).  The Federal Circuit’s predecessor court, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, had made similar suggestions. See, e.g., In re Bernhardt, 417 F.2d 1395 (Ct. Cus. &amp; Pat. App. 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the Federal Circuit overruled the Supreme Court on this point—or claimed that the passage of the 1952 patent recodification law had done so. 

In its decision in ''[[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;128 S. Ct. 2109 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; however, the Supreme Court seems to have assumed without any discussion that its old precedents such as ''Lincoln Engineering'' (uncited in the ''Quanta'' opinion) are still in force, as least with regard to the [[exhaustion doctrine]]. In ''Quanta'', the Court considered the sale of a patented microprocessor to "exhaust" not only the patent on the microprocessor but the patent on a conventional personal computer (PC) containing the microprocessor, since the PC patent had essentially the same inventive concept (or departure from the prior art) as the microprocessor patent.

After 1984 it appeared that it was possible to obtain patents on old combinations, for example not only a new motor but also an otherwise conventional disc drive containing the new motor. It has also been held that the sale of the motor, in such a case, does not exhaust the patent on the disc drive containing the new motor. Hence, a purchaser of the motor who incorporated it into a disk drive would infringe the disk drive patent.&lt;ref&gt;See Minebea Co. v. Papst, 444 F. Supp. 2d 68 (D.D.C. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; It is now uncertain whether such patents are valid. In any event, the [[Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.|''Quanta'']] decision appears to hold that the [[exhaustion doctrine]] shields from infringement liability the foregoing motor purchaser that incorporates the motor into a disk drive.&lt;ref&gt; This result would be contrary to that reached in Minebea Co. v. Papst, 444 F. Supp. 2d 68 (D.D.C. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhausted combinations and nonstatutory subject matter==
Claiming a computer-related advance as an exhausted combination may provide a way to prevent the claimed advance from being classified as [[nonstatutory subject matter]] under section 101 of the US patent law. Placing a process that fails the [[machine-or-transformation test]] in a machine environment may overcome the absence of implementation by a specific machine, as required by [[In re Bilski]] and the Supreme Court decisions on which it is based.&lt;ref&gt;This expedient was suggested initially in Richard H. Stern, [http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/AlgWar.pdf ''Tales From the Algorithm War''], 18 AIPLA Q.J. 371 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; (The successfulness of this expedient depends on acceptance of the Federal Circuit's abolition of the exhausted combination doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Radio Steel &amp; Mfg. Co. v. MTD Products, Inc.'', 731 F.2d 840, 845 (Fed. Cir. 1984); ''In re Bernhardt'', 417 F.2d 1395 (Ct. Cus. &amp; Pat. App. 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;)

For example, the form of the processes claimed in ''[[Diamond v. Diehr]]'',&lt;ref&gt;450 U.S. 175 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Parker v. Flook]]'',&lt;ref&gt;437 U.S. 584 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Gottschalk v. Benson]]''&lt;ref&gt;409 U.S. 63 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; may appropriately be compared. In ''Diehr'', the claim is to “a method of operating a rubber-molding press” and the claim contains at least minimal references to the press and other apparatus. In ''Flook'', the claim is to a "method for updating the value of at least one alarm limit," where an “’alarm limit’ is a number.” The claim does not say anything about a reaction vessel or even temperature measuring devices. In ''Benson'', the claim is to “a  data processing method for converting binary coded decimal number representations into binary number representations.” One claim mentions a reentrant shift register and the other claim mentions no apparatus at all. In ''Flook'', the claim could have instead been to “a method of operating a hydrocracking plant wherein hydrocarbon feedstock is placed into a chemical reactor, heat is applied, etc.” The claim, although to an exhausted combination,&lt;ref&gt;The Court’s opinion states that it was conceded that the process was known and conventional except for its use of the algorithm.&lt;/ref&gt; would have required apparatus as did that in the ''Diehr'' case. Similarly, the claim in ''Benson'' could have been to a method of operating a telephone switch box or perhaps even a method of providing binary-coded-decimal numerical signals to a binary-coded operating device. Again, by providing a mechanical environment, even though it was an exhausted combination, the claims drafter might have avoided the holding of nonstatutory subject matter. It is possible that careful claims drafting techniques will succeed in elevating form over substance, to avoid the impact of the machine-or-transformation test.

The preceding analysis may have been overtaken by the Supreme Court's 2014 decision in ''[[Alice v. CLS Bank]]''. In that case the Court confirmed and extended the legal analysis of its prior decisions in ''[[Parker v. Flook]]'' and ''[[Mayo v. Prometheus]]'' to claimed inventions involving implementations of computer algorithms, methods of doing business, and other methods of organizing human activity. The form of analysis that these cases dictate is that the presence of a machine, in particular a programmed digital computer, is not enough without more to assure patent eligibility. Rather, the implementation of the underlying idea must embody an "inventive concept." The inventive concept must provide "something extra" that extends beyond the algorithm or other idea, if an otherwise patent-ineligible claim is to be saved from patent ineligibility--according to these cases and recent lower court decisions that follow in their wake.&lt;ref&gt;See generally the cases discussed in the Wikipedia article [[Software patents under United States patent law]], particularly the last several footnotes.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the natural capability to produce offspring. A lack of fertility is [[infertility]] while a lack of fecundity would be called [[Sterility (physiology)|sterility]].

Human demography considers only human fecundity which is often intentionally limited through [[contraception]], while population [[biology]] studies all [[Organism|organisms]]. The term fecundity in population biology is often used to describe the rate of offspring production after one time step (often annual). In this sense, fecundity may include both birth rates and survival of young to that time step. Fecundity is under both [[Genetics|genetic]] and environmental control, and is the major measure of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. ''Fecundation'' is another term for [[fertilization]]. ''Superfecundity'' or ''retrofecundity'' refers to an organism's ability to store another organism's sperm (after [[copulation]]) and fertilize its own eggs from that store after a period of time, essentially making it appear as though fertilization occurred without sperm (i.e. [[parthenogenesis]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Fecundity is important and well studied in the field of [[population ecology]]. Fecundity can increase or decrease in a [[population]] according to current conditions and certain [[regulating factors]]. For instance, in times of hardship for a population, such as a [[starvation|lack of food]], juvenile and eventually adult fecundity has been shown to decrease (i.e. due to a lack of resources the juvenile individuals are unable to reproduce, eventually the adults will run out of resources and reproduction will cease).

Fecundity has also been shown to increase in [[ungulates]] with relation to warmer weather.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In sexual [[evolutionary biology]], especially in sexual selection, fecundity is contrasted to [[reproductivity]].

In [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]], fecundability is the probability of being [[pregnant]] in a single [[menstrual cycle]], and fecundity is the probability of achieving a live birth within a single cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Berek JS and Novak E. Berek &amp; Novak's gynecology. 14th ed. 2007, Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. Pg. 1186&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12301">'''Feminist philosophy of science''' is a branch of philosophy that seeks to understand how the acquirement of knowledge through scientific means has been influenced by notions of gender and gender roles in society.  Feminist philosophers of science question how scientific research and scientific knowledge itself may be influenced and possibly compromised by the social and professional framework within which that research and knowledge is established and exists. It has been described as being located "at the intersections of the philosophy of science and feminist science scholarship",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50661258|title=The Blackwell guide to the philosophy of science|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell|others=Machamer, Peter K., Silberstein, Michael.|isbn=0631221077|location=Malden, Mass.|oclc=50661258}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has attracted considerable attention since the 1970s.

[[Feminist epistemology]] often emphasizes "situated knowledge"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kurki|first=Milja|date=May 2015|title=Stretching Situated Knowledge: From Standpoint Epistemology to Cosmology and Back Again|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0305829815583322#articleCitationDownloadContainer|journal=Millennium: Journal of International Studies|volume=43|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that hinges on one's individual perspectives on a subject. Feminist philosophers often highlight the under-representation of female scientists in academia and the possibility that science currently has androcentric biases. Scientific theory has been accused of being more compatible with male cognitive styles and reasoning. Feminist epistemology suggests that integrating feminine modes of thought and logic that are undervalued by current scientific theory will enable improvement and broadening of scientific perspectives. Advocates assert that it may be guide in creating a philosophy of science that is more accessible to public. Practitioners of feminist philosophy of science also seek to promote gender equality in scientific fields and greater recognition of the achievements of female scientists.

Critics have argued that the political commitments of advocates of feminist philosophy of science is incompatible with modern-day scientific objectivity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crasnow|first=Sharon|date=2008-11-01|title=Feminist philosophy of science: ‘standpoint’ and knowledge|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-006-9069-z|journal=Science &amp; Education|language=en|volume=17|issue=10|pages=1089–1110|doi=10.1007/s11191-006-9069-z|issn=0926-7220}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing the success of the scientific method due to its lauded objectivity and "value-free"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crasnow|first=Sharon|date=2013-04-01|title=Feminist Philosophy of Science: Values and Objectivity|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phc3.12023/abstract|journal=Philosophy Compass|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=413–423|doi=10.1111/phc3.12023|issn=1747-9991}}&lt;/ref&gt; methods of knowledge-making.[[File:Barbara Askins, Chemist - GPN-2004-00022.jpg|thumb|Women often weren't allowed to work officially as scientists, only as assistants for male scientists.|alt=]]

== History ==
The feminist Philosophy of science was born out of feminist science studies in the 1960s. It would however be the 1980s before Feminist Philosophy of Science would develop its own unique identity. One of the first and most important publications released was from a women’s academic journal called “Signs” with a piece titled: “Women, Science, and Society”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stimpson|first1=Catharine R.|last2=Burstyn|first2=Joan N.|title=Editorial|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|date=October 1978|volume=4|issue=1|pages=1–3|doi=10.1086/493565|url=https://doi.org/10.1086/493565|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt; This piece was published in August 1978 by Catherine Stimpson and Joan Burstyn. "This first collection of what today would be recognizable as "feminist science studies" featured scholarship in three areas: critiques of gender bias in science, history of women in science, and social science data and public policy considerations on the status of women in the science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Sarah S.|date=2010-12-01|title=Feminist philosophy of science: history, contributions, and challenges|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-010-9791-6|journal=Synthese|language=en|volume=177|issue=3|pages=337–362|doi=10.1007/s11229-010-9791-6|issn=0039-7857}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three topics have remained prominent issues in feminist science studies of modern day.

Feminist science studies had become more philosophical and more ambitious by the 1980s and even pursued to redefine the core epistemological concepts. The reason for this shift in feminist science studies was due to a corresponding shift in many fields of academic feminism. This shift led to a parting of ways between scholarship on “women in science” and “feminist critiques of science”. This was documented by feminist scholars [[Helen Longino]] and [[Evelynn Hammonds]] in their 1990 book ''Conflicts and Tensions in the Feminist Study of Gender and Science''.

By the late nineties, feminist science studies had become well-established and had many prominent scholars within its field of study. Philosopher [[John Searle]] characterized feminism in 1993 as a “cause to be advanced” more so than a “domain to be studied”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Searle|first1=John R.|title=Rationality and Realism, What Is at Stake?|journal=Daedalus|date=1993|volume=122|issue=4|pages=55–83|jstor=20027199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist philosophy of science ==

===Objectivity and values===
Some have questioned the objectivity of Feminist Philosophy of Science. Feminists however argue that rather than undermine objectivity, incorporating feminist values could help create more robust and sophisticated research methods which in turn may well produce better balanced results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crasnow|first1=Sharon|title=Feminist Philosophy of Science: Values and Objectivity.|journal=Philosophy Compass|date=4 August 2013|pages=413–423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standpoint and knowledge===
Feminist Philosophy of Science has traditionally been highly critical of the lack of access and opportunities for women in science and believe science can, and has been "distorted by sexist values"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crasnow|first1=Sharon|title=Feminist Philosophy of Science: Values and Objectivity.|journal=Philosophy Compass|date=4 August 2013|pages=413–423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon Crasnow highlights how the "exclusion of women as researchers and subjects"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crasnow|first1=Sharon|title=Feminist Philosophy of Science: Values and Objectivity.|journal=Philosophy Compass|date=4 August 2013|pages=413–423}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in scientific research, studies and projects can lead to questionable methods and methodologies and ultimately unreliable or inaccurate results. Feminists have come up with a new concept, one of a ‘successor science’,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crasnow|first=Sharon|date=2008-11-01|title=Feminist philosophy of science: ‘standpoint’ and knowledge|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-006-9069-z|journal=Science &amp; Education|language=en|volume=17|issue=10|pages=1089–1110|doi=10.1007/s11191-006-9069-z|issn=0926-7220}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "different [[Feminism|feminist]] science". As it is not yet complete, the methodology is still up for debate as it mixes the subjectivity with the objectivity of science. What this successor science is quite hard to imagine especially when considering how successful modern science is. Some feminist philosophies of science revolve around asking if this success is due to objectivity which includes "impartiality, neutrality, autonomy, and indifference to political positions and the values". Feminists in this field discuss whether the objectivity in science is true and rational, independent of social and political factors. Feminist [[epistemology]] asks about the scientific method, standards of rationality, and the role gender plays in shaping knowledge. According to these feminists, this challenges the traditional view of objectivity.

Relating to [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivity]], epistemology can give a fuller understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge. [[Feminist epistemology]] is one of a group of approaches in science studies that urges us to recognize the role of the social in the production of knowledge. Feminist epistemology directs people to consider features of themselves and culture as beings of knowledge that had been outside what was considered appropriate. The goals of researchers and the values that shape the choice of goals are relevant to the knowledge we arrive at. This has implications both for how we train scientists and for how we educate everyone about science. If science is seen as more connected to application, more related to human needs and desires, traditionally [[underrepresented group]]s will have greater motivation to succeed and persist in their science courses or pursue scientific careers. Motivation will be greater as members of underrepresented groups see how science can produce knowledge that has value to their concerns in ways that are consistent with good scientific methodology. Feminist epistemology urges a continued exploration of science in this way and so has much to offer science education.

===Challenges and contributions===
One of the major challenges facing feminist philosophers of science lies in convincing some skeptics in the fields of philosophy and science  that Feminist Philosophy of Science is in fact a legitimate and objective field of academic research and study rather than an agenda driven ideology. Dr. Richardson points out that those who level this accusation at Feminist Philosophy of Science completely misunderstand its motivations and ambitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=Sarah S|title=Feminist Philosophy of Science: history, contributions and challenges.|journal=Springer Science + Business Media|date=26 October 2010|pages=337–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richardson describes how many feminist philosophers of science are involved in "ambitious constructive projects to build a better science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=Sarah S|title=Feminist Philosophy of Science: history, contributions and challenges.|journal=Springer Science + Business Media|date=26 October 2010|pages=337–362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Case studies have played a major role in furthering and advancing feminist philosophy of science. For example, a study conducted by Lloyd in 2005 on the function female orgasm. She explores how evolutionary biologists made false assumptions as to the function of the female orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lloyd|first1=Elisabeth A.|title=The case of the female orgasm : bias in the science of evolution|date=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674022461}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believed that it must have reproductive purpose in females simply because it does in males. They went as far as to ignore clear evidence as it went against their initial beliefs. This critique caused extensive debate as it attacked the core beliefs held by evolutionary biologists. Work like this has and is currently being conducted by feminist philosophers of science as they challenge traditional philosophical questions such as pluralism, objectivity and background assumptions.

One of the greatest challenges faced by female philosophers is marginalization within the academic field of philosophy according to Dr. Richardson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richardson|first1=Sarah S.|title=Feminist philosophy of science: history, contributions, and challenges|journal=Synthese|date=26 October 2010|volume=177|issue=3|pages=337–362|doi=10.1007/s11229-010-9791-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They face exclusion in scientific fields and are marginalized and vastly unrepresented similarly to minorities in the field of philosophy. Their critiques of many topics such as gender bias are often changed, distorted and ineffectively translated by scientists and therefore by the general public.

In [[United States trademark law]], the '''functionality doctrine''' prevents [[manufacturer]]s from protecting specific features of a product by means of [[trademark]] law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/functionality_doctrine_trademark Functionality doctrine] at [[Wex]], from the [[Legal Information Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two branches of the functionality doctrine: utilitarian functionality and aesthetic functionality. The rationale behind functionality doctrine is that product markets would not be truly competitive if newcomers could not make a product with a feature that consumers demand. Utilitarian functionality provides grounds to deny federal trademark protection to product features which do something useful.  Patent law, not trademark, protects useful processes, [[machine]]s, and material [[invention]]s.  Patented designs are presumed to be functional until proven otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;''[[TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc.]]'', 532 U.S. 23 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  Aesthetic functionality  provides grounds to deny trademark protection to design features which are included to make the product more aesthetically appealing and commercially desirable.  Aesthetic features are within the purview of [[copyright]] law, which provides protection to creative and original works of authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|102}}(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utilitarian Functionality==

Courts will look to the following factors when determining utilitarian functionality:
* Whether a feature is essential to the use or purpose of the product; or
* Whether a feature affects the cost or quality of the product; or
* Whether granting of trademark for the exclusive use of the feature would put competitors at a significant non-reputation related disadvantage&lt;ref&gt;''[[Qualitex v. Jacobson Products]]'', 514 U.S. 159 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014 the federal circuit courts are split on their utilitarian functionality analysis. Most circuits, such as the Fifth Circuit&lt;ref&gt;''[[German Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz GMBH v. Ritter GMBH]]'', 289 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sixth Circuit&lt;ref&gt;''[[Antioch Co. v. Western Trimming Corp.]]'', 347 F.3d 150 (6th Cir. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; follow the Supreme Court's analysis in ''[[TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;532 U.S. 23 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on whether the feature is essential to the use or purpose of the product. The Federal Circuit in contrast focuses its analysis on whether permitting a product feature to be trademarked would impair competitors.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Valu Engineering v. Rexnord Corp]]'', 278 F.3d 1268 (Fed. Cir. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic Functionality==
In the United States, the “functionality” doctrine exists to stop a party from obtaining exclusive trade dress or trademark rights in the functional features of a product or its packaging. The doctrine developed as a way to preserve the division between what trademark law protects and areas that are better protected by patent or copyright law. Thus, the functionality doctrine serves to prevent trademark owners from inhibiting legitimate competition &lt;ref&gt;http://www.inta.org/INTABulletin/Pages/AestheticFunctionalityAfterLouboutin.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

When the aesthetic development of the good is intended to enhance the design and make the product more commercially desirable, trademark protection may be denied because the consumer is drawn to the design. The distinctiveness of the mark serves to identify the product rather than the source, and trademark protection becomes inappropriate. The underlying theory as aesthetics become integrated with functionality, the resulting product strongly resembles product design, which may receive no trademark protection absent secondary meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Louboutin S.A. v. Yves Saint Laurent America, Inc., 778 F. Supp. 2d 445, 447–48 (S.D.N.Y. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

This defense is generally seen in the fashion industry. Clothing brands can only be protected if they've acquired secondary meaning, and most of clothing design is held to be functional and is afforded no protection.&lt;ref&gt;https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/529/205/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5343">The '''Hayden Act''', introduced by California Senator [[Tom Hayden]] as Senate Bill 1785 on February 18, 1998, amended California Law as it applies to companion animals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/97-98/bill/sen/sb_1751-1800/sb_1785_bill_19980218_introduced.pdf |title=BILL NUMBER: SB 1785 CHAPTERED BILL TEXT |publisher=[[California State Senate]] |accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the then existing law, dogs or cats impounded by public pounds or shelters could be killed after 72 hours of being impounded.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt; The Hayden Act, effective July 1, 1999, expanded this minimum impound time to 4 or 6 business days, as specified, and required that the animal be released to a nonprofit animal rescue or adoption organization in certain circumstances, subject to specified exceptions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2/&gt;

==Authorship and Ratification==
Along with Hayden, law professor in [[animal law]] and nonprofit law Taimie Bryant of [[UCLA School of Law]] is also credited with writing the majority of the laws. The bill became law after then [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Pete Wilson]] signed it on September 22, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite California statute |year=1998 |chapter=752 |page=4903–4917 |title=An act to amend Sections 1814, 1816, 1834, 1845, 1846, 1847, and 2080 of, and to add Section 1834.4 to, the Civil Code, to amend Sections 31108, 31752, and 32001 of, to add Sections 17005, 17006, 31752.5, 31753, and 32003 to, and to add, repeal, and add Section 31754 of, the Food and Agricultural Code, and to amend Section 597.1 of, and to add Section 599d to, the Penal Code, relating to stray animals. |ex= |res= |HR= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''IPTraf'''  is a [[Computer software|software]] - based [[Shell (computing)|console]] that provides [[Computer network|network]] statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://iptraf.seul.org/about.html |title= About IPTraf |accessdate= 8 Nov 2011 |language= English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It works by collecting information from [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] connections, such as statistics and activity interfaces and drops TCP and UDP traffic. It is available in [[Linux|GNU / Linux]] [[Operating system|operating systems.]]

== Features ==

In addition to a menu of options to full screen, IPTraf has the following characteristics:

* IP traffic monitor displays information about network traffic.
* General statistics Interfaces.
* [[Local area network|LAN]] statistics module that discovers s host displays data about their activity.
* Monitor [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP,]] UDP account showing the network packets for port connections of applications.
* Use the "raw socket interface" that takes [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] allowing it to be used by a wide range of "network cards".

== Recognized protocols ==

IPTtraf supports multiple protocols:

* [[Internet Protocol|IP]]
* [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]
* [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]
* [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]]
* [[Interior gateway protocol|IGP]]
* [[IGMP]]
* [[IGRP]]
* [[OSPF]]
* [[Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]]
* [[RARP]]

== Supported interfaces ==

IPTraf supports a wide range of network interfaces:

* Local loopback
* All [[Ethernet]] interfaces supported by GNU / Linux.
* All FDDI interfaces supported by GNU / Linux.
* [[Serial Line Internet Protocol|SLIP]]
* Asynchronous PPP
* Synchronous PPP over ISDN
* ISDN with encapsulation Raw IP
* ISDN with encapsulation Cisco HDLC
* Parallel Line IP.

== Data structures ==

The main data structures using the various facilities of the program are in doubly linked list, which facilitates their movement. The maximum number of entries is limited only by available [[Random-access memory|memory.]] Search operations in most of the facilities are carried out linearly, a fact that causes a mild but almost imperceptible impact. Because of the speed with which tends to increase the traffic monitor IPs, it use a [[hash table]] to perform searches more efficiently. (Search operations are carried out whenever the program needs to check if it is already listed the Ethernet or IP address or protocol or network port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://iptraf.seul.org/techinfo.html |title= IPTraf Technical Information |accessdate= 15 May 2010 |author= Gerard Paul Java |date=1997 |language= English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, also it has a folding mechanism links merely contains notes on old entries that are available for reuse. Every time a connection is restarted or completely closed, the ticket information is not released, but added an entry to the ''closed-list.''  By detecting a new connection, the list is checked and if it is not empty, the first entry in use that is available will be reused, then, clear the ''list-closed''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15157">The term '''knowledge mobilization''' ('''KMb''') refers to moving available [[knowledge]] (often from formal research) into active use.  More than just "bridging the gap", KMb seeks to make connections between research/expertise and policy/practice in order to improve outcomes in various organizations or sectors.  KMb involves knowledge sharing between research producers (e.g. university researchers) and research users (including professionals or others whose work can benefit from research findings), often with the help of third parties or intermediaries.  The concept has grown out of increasing recognition that verified empirical knowledge should be the basis for many policies and practices.
Social science research deals with the people side of quality of life issues and nation-building that are so crucial to the future of humanity. Human, technological and cultural developments are needed for economic prosperity, environmental sustainability, social harmony and cultural vitality. Yet using research in the social sciences presents particular challenges because the issues are often complex and long-term, and deeply affected by local contexts.

The term KMb gained wider use following the publication of the evaluation report of the Community-University Research Alliance (CURA) program of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada ([[SSHRC]]) in 2004. This led SSHRC to create a division of Knowledge Products and Mobilization to enhance and accelerate the movement of research findings into policy and program development.  Although many other terms are used to describe this same work, KMb, or knowledge mobilization, is the term most often used by the social science and humanities fields in Canada.

==Definitions==

As in many other areas of social science, many different terms and approaches are used to define the knowledge mobilization process in different sectors and disciplines. The health sector often uses the term knowledge translation, whereas the business sector uses knowledge management, and so on. The Research Supporting Practice in Education (RSPE) Team at the [[University of Toronto]] – [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] has created a synthesized list of the various terms and definitions currently being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301120304/http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/rspe/KM_Products/Terminology/index.html|archivedate=2011-03-01|url=http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/rspe/KM_Products/Terminology/index.html|title=Terminology: What is Knowledge Mobilization Online?|date=1 March 2011|publisher=University of Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable overlap between different terms but the subtle differences can affect our understanding of the topic.  For example, the term Knowledge Transfer, implies that knowledge is like an object that can be given from one person to another, whereas terms such as Knowledge Exchange or Knowledge Mobilization imply that knowledge is altered as it passes from person to person. However, regardless of the term, the underlying intent in all cases is to make research matter more in policy and practice for organizational and system improvement.
The term '[[knowledge]]' also carries multiple meanings.  Some literature describes two types of knowledge; explicit and tacit.  [[Tacit knowledge]] is gained through personal experience, and is difficult to codify and transfer; where [[explicit knowledge]] is often instrumental and can be more easily transported through various mediums.  KMb tends to focus on explicit knowledge derived from formal research, while recognizing that tacit knowledge is also very important in practice.

Even within formal research settings, there is often disagreement about how much and what kinds of evidence provide sufficient warrant to claim that something is 'knowledge'.
A similar debate exists over what can be regarded as 'use' of research, with considerable evidence showing that research has an impact in diffuse ways and sometimes over long periods of time&lt;ref name="utoronto.ca"&gt;[http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/rspe/ "Linking Research and Practice", University of Toronto. On line.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228080010/http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/rspe/ |date=2013-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed definition of knowledge mobilization, in relation to other practices such as community engagement, can be found on the website of the Institute for Community Engaged Scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theresearchshop.ca|title=Community Engaged Scholarship Institute|publisher=University of Guelph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==

Knowledge mobilization is a proactive process that involves specific efforts to build relationships between research producers and users, such as formal and informal events, networks, and collaboration on resources for research use. The broad concept of knowledge mobilization encompasses a variety of strategies, including producer push (where researchers do the work of trying to share knowledge), user pull (where research users seek information), knowledge exchange and the co-production of knowledge. These strategies may be informal or formal and can take place in many different places and ways.

The internet has become the prime vehicle through which research knowledge is shared, although direct personal connections among people remain a powerful means of sharing knowledge. In some fields or organizations there are specific roles for knowledge mobilization specialists (whose roles may have various names) to find, evaluate, synthesize and summarize findings to tailor and maximize the use of relevant and appropriate research.  The goal is to replace practices based on belief with evidence-based practices in order to produce more effective outcomes. Researchers and research users can both benefit from the interaction required by KMb.  Collaboration among various parties can improve the research enterprise as well by facilitating more relevant and effective scholarship as well as increased take-up of research findings.

==Brokers==

[[Knowledge broker]]s or intermediaries act as bridges between the users and producers of the knowledge. Such brokering is essential to ensure that the right information is available to the right people, at the right time and in the right format. These ideas of quality research informed by the needs of research users, accurate interpretation, open access and just-in-time service are the bases for good researcher-user interface, often provided by knowledge brokers who can synthesize a large body of research and look for policy and practice implications that facilitate use of research results. Many different individuals and organizations play a brokering or intermediary role, from think tanks to lobby groups to political parties to professional or trade associations, to promoters of particular products or strategies.  These various bodies may have very different motivations and degrees of objectivity in their approach.  Much brokering occurs as part of political debate, in which the contention among ideas is part of broader political processes.

Research into the role of knowledge brokering in the UK health sector found that key individuals often play a major role in knowledge mobilization. A large study of knowledge mobilization by [[University of Oxford]] researchers found effective 'knowledge leadership' is crucial to moving evidence-based research into organizational practice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/17556851/Knowledge_leadership_Mobilising_management_research_by_becoming_the_knowledge_object.html|title=Knowledge Leadership: Mobilising Management Research by Becoming the Knowledge Object|first1=Michael D.|last1=Fischer|first2=Dopson|last2=Sue|first3=Fitzgerald|last3=Louise|first4=Bennett|last4=Chris|first5=Ferlie|last5=Ewan|first6=Ledger|last6=Jean|first7=McGivern|last7=Gerry|journal=Human Relations|doi=10.1177/0018726715619686|volume=69|year=2016|pages=1563–1585}}&lt;/ref&gt; and creating 'epistemic fit'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/28656239/Epistemic_fit_and_the_mobilisation_of_management_knowledge_in_health_care|title='Epistemic fit' and the mobilisation of management knowledge in health care|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Health Services Research Foundation (CHSRF), which has made extensive use of knowledge brokering and promoted evidence-informed decision making in the health services field, has developed extensive tools and resources that are finding use outside the health field. Similarly, the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] (CIHR) have developed the idea of knowledge translation as a means to make better use of research in the health field.  The RSPE provides many examples of and resources for knowledge brokering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301120135/http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/rspe/KM_Products/Conceptual_Frameworks/index.html|archivedate=2011-03-01|url=http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/rspe/KM_Products/Conceptual_Frameworks/index.html|title=Linking Research and Practice|date=1 March 2011|publisher=University of Toronto. Conceptual Frameworks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Networks==

Networks are an important mechanism to support KMb. A number of KMb networks support professional knowledge brokers and the practice of KMb.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.researchimpact.ca|ResearchImpact-RéseauImpactRecherche]&lt;/ref&gt; ResearchImpact-RéseauImpact Recherche (RIR) is Canada's KMb network. Led by York University in Toronto, and pioneered by the work of David Phipps, it includes knowledge brokers from [[York University]], [[Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Université du Québec à Montréal]], [[Université de Montréal]], [[Carleton University]], [[University of Guelph]], [[University of Saskatchewan]], [[Kwantlen Polytechnic University]], [[University of Victoria]], [[McMaster University]], and [[University of New Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drussa.net/index.php|title=DRUSSA Blogs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (DRUSSA) is a network of 24 universities developing professional supports for research uptake (=KMb). The Canadian &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktecop.ca|Knowledge Transfer and Exchange Community of Practice]&lt;/ref&gt; (KTECoP) has over 800 members and has chapters in Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver. Ed Comms (www.educationcommunities.org) is the open to all knowledge mobilization network supported by a world wide network universities and educational organisations that form the Education Futures Collaboration (www.edfuturescollaboration.org). A core goal of Ed Comms is to link researchers and research users and to support educators to find others interested in collaborative working particularly to scale up small scale research so that educational research can be more impactful.

==Open access and open data==

Movements such as [[open access]] and [[open data]] can play a positive role in KMb. Access to scholarly research and data sets has increased partly as a result of these movements, as well as greater digitization and dissemination of resources by government and NGOs. However, many institutions do not yet make their research publicly available, lack an open access repository or directory, or have well organized websites for posting research-based resources.&lt;ref name="utoronto.ca"/&gt;  However access to research is not nearly sufficient for Knowledge Mobilization, as the main barriers to research use are less a matter of knowing than they are of the capacity and motivation to use that knowledge in practice.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Publications==

The field of KMb has been developing for about 50 years now.  A good review of this work is in Estabrooks et al. (2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Estabrooks, C, Derksen, L, Winther, C, Lavis, J, Scott, S, Wallin, R, Profetto-McGrath, J|lastauthoramp=y|year=2008|title=The intellectual structure and substance of the knowledge utilization field: A longitudinal author co-citation analysis, 1945 to 2004|journal=Implementation Science|volume=3|p=49|doi=10.1186/1748-5908-3-49|pmid=19014512|pmc=2621243}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many excellent research articles examining research utilization.  In 2007, Sandra Nutley and colleagues from the Research Unit for Research Utilization (RURU) at the [[University of Edinburgh]] published one of the most comprehensive guides to KMb, ''Using Evidence: How Research Can Inform Public Services'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nutley, Sandra M|last2=Walter|last3=Davies|year=2007|title=Using evidence: how research can inform public services|publisher=Policy Press|isbn=978-1-86134-664-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which identifies three interacting domains: research production, research use, and the intermediary process that links these two domains.  This book provides an extensive review of the literature on research utilization from traditional constructs to contemporary design, from the practice and policy perspectives, and examines strategies to enhance research utilization and measure the impact of research use.

Many resources regarding this field, including definitions, conceptual models and links to other organizations, can be found on the website of the RSPE team at the University of Toronto's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) and at KMbeing.com. A recent review of current research in knowledge mobilization can be found in the London Review of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mobilising research knowledge in education|journal= London Review of Education|volume=9|issue=1|pp=15–26|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ioep/clre/2011/00000009/00000001/art00003?crawler=true|author=Ben Levin|doi=10.1080/14748460.2011.550431|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madis Kõiv''' (5 December 1929, Tartu, Estonia – 24 September 2014, Tartu, Estonia) was an [[Estonia]]n [[writer]], [[philosopher]] and [[physics|physicist]].

==Education==
Kõiv attended school in [[Tartu]] after the [[World War II|second World War]], graduating in the early 1950s with a degree in [[nuclear physics]]. Kõiv worked as a [[scientist]] and lecturer until 1991.

==Career as a playwright==
Kõiv always entertained a fascination with and love for literature. He wrote mostly for personal entertainment until the 1950s, when he became active in Estonian literary circles. His earliest published works were written with friends from these circles. He also wrote under a [[pseudonym]] for several years.

His first published work was a play called ''Küüni täitmine'' (''Filling the Hay Barn'') written as a collaboration between Kõiv (using his pseudonym '''Jaanus Andreus Nooremb''') and [[Hando Runnel]] in 1978.  In 1999, the play was successfully produced for the first time.

Kõiv then wrote two pieces with [[Vaino Vahing]]. The first was a play titled ''Faehlmann. Keskpäev. Õhtuselgus.'' (''Faehlmann. Noon. Evening Clarity.'') The two also wrote the dialogue novel ''Endspiel. Laskumine orgu.'' (''Endspiel. Descent into the Valley.'')

Just before the end of the decade, Kõiv began to publish works he had previously written for his own amusement under his own name. Kõiv became the most essential Estonian [[playwright]] of the 1950s and 1960s.

In the early 1990s, Kõiv began to gain fame. In 1991 and 1993, he won the Tuglas short story award for ''Film'' and ''The Life of an Eternal Physicus'', respectively. He won the annual Estonian literary award in 1991 for ''The Meeting''. He won the annual Estonian literary award again in 1995 for ''The Philosopher's Day'' and ''Return to Father''. Kõiv won the award a third time in 1999 for ''Scenes From the Hundred Years' War''.

Kõiv had released only 22 of the plays he had written and said that these comprise half of the dramatic literature he has created.

==Career as a novelist==
Kõiv was also the author of several novels. ''Widow'' and ''Aporia of Attica, Tragedy of Elea'' are two of his best known. In 1996 he published ''[[Aken (novel)|Aken]]''.

==Philosophy==
Madis Kõiv was one of the many proponents of [[analytical philosophy]] in Estonia. In 1991, he became one of the initiators of the Seminar of Analytical Philosophy.

==Memoirs==
Kõiv's [[memoir]]s (the series ''Studia memoriae'') consist largely of introspection, in sharp contrast to a typical [[biography]].

'''Michael Gottlieb Birckner''' (21 August 1756 – 1 December 1798) was a [[Danish people|Danish]] priest and philosopher.

Birckner especially explored the subject of [[Freedom of Speech]]. The American historian [[H. Arnold Barton]] has characterised Birckner, along with [[Niels Ditlev Riegels]], as being one of "the most original thinkers" of the radical group of authors in Denmark in this period.&lt;ref&gt;H. Arnold Barton, 1986, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish jurist [[Peter Germer]] in his book ''The Nature of Freedom of Speech'' (''Ytringsfrihedens Væsen'', 1973) shows that Birckners ideas was akin to ideas that Scottish-American philosopher [[Alexander Meiklejohn]] proposed in his ''Free Speech and Its Relation to Self-Government'' (1948).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Germer* Peter Germer, ''Ytringsfrihedens Væsen'', Juristforbundets Forlag, 1973,  p. 202. {{ISBN|87-574-2440-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Michael Gottlieb Birckner was born in [[Copenhagen]]. At age 3 he lost his mother, Anna Marie (born Wiborg), and half a year later his father, brickmason Johan Michael Birckner, died. The city [[mortician]] took in the orphan, and in due time Birckner graduated from the city's [[Latin school]] in 1772. He achieved his [[theology|theological]] degree in 1784. He had also spent his time at the [[University of Copenhagen|university]] studying [[philosophy]] and [[philology]], and he especially excelled in modern languages, he spoke [[German language|German]] like a native and he wrote verses in [[English language|English]]. He wanted a position as a priest, but he disliked the parlors of the rich and powerful, so he did not achieve a call until 1790. The position was as a German minister on the isolated island of [[Föhr]] which was part of the kingdom of [[Denmark-Norway]] at the time.

Before Birckner left the capital he had become a proponent of the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], which at that time was becoming popular in Denmark. But he was also under the influence of the radical [[France|French]] anti-clergy [[rationalism]]. He had published an article in the influential Danish periodical ''Minerva'' with the title ''An answer to the question: Should the nobility be suppressed?'' (July 1790). His answer to the question in the title was affirmative, provided that the privileges of nobility is an injustice and that the burgher can become "that which at present only the nobility is, without upsetting society as a whole". The article was soon translated into German and a reviewer of the ''Göttingische gelärdes Anzeigen'' (1792, p.&amp;nbsp;1899) praised it highly.

== Stay at Föhr ==
Birckners stay at Föhr did not turn out to be as desolate as he and his friends had feared. He passed his time with studies, social visits and a pursuit to "form a young man into a productive citizen". The inhabitants of the island was pleased by his "philosophical" preachings which he held every third Sunday. He did express regret at not being within easy reach of the literary means of the capital, but he learned to pass his time thinking instead. It became his habit to first think a subject matter through in his mind before reading what others had written about it. He especially worked on the problem about the [[freedom of press]] and its limits, which among other things the recent conviction of the satiric poet [[Peter Andreas Heiberg]] had incurred in Danish debate. In his solitude he expressed his thoughts on the matter in writing and the first of his many treaties on the subject was published in ''Minerva'' in March 1791.

== Chaplain ==
The following year he was surprised to learn that his friends had petitioned on his behalf for the [[chaplaincy]] in [[Korsør]]. In the beginning he was not pleased with the transition to the small provincial town in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]], because he had to preach twice every Sunday instead of once every third Sunday. But after making the move, little by little his sentiments changed. He regularly was present by the dinner table of the vicar Frederik Plum, who later became bishop of [[Fyn]], and Birckner found company with which to share his spiritual and philosophical sentiments. It was at the Plums that he met Henriette Christine Hornemann, the daughter of vicar Jacob Hornemann, sister of the philosopher [[Christian Hornemann]], and in 1795 he married this gifted young woman.

The journey to his new position had incurred a coughing sickness which over time became very serious. His income was very low, and he often suffered from want so badly that he at one time considered giving up the chaplaincy in favour of a position as a teacher and letting his wife contribute to the household by letting her serve as a chambermaid.

== Struggle for Freedom of the Press ==
[[File:Birckner Om Trykkefriheden og dens Love.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The titlepage to the second and extended edition of Birckners ''On the Freedom of Press and its Laws'' from 1797.]]
But neither his sickness nor his poverty prevented him from continuing his philosophical endeavours. When the bishop of Zealand Nicolai Balle Edinger had reported the poet [[Malthe Conrad Bruun]]s recently published book ''The Catechism of the Aristocrats'' (''Aristocraternes Catechismus'', 1796) to the authorities for infringing the press laws, Birckner anonymously published a small tract which criticised the bishop for playing the part of head of police instead of minding his ecclesiastical pursuits.

However his real struggle for freedom of the press was not carried out anonymously. He had already previously shown that the Danish laws regarding this subject did not allow for a complete freedom of the press. It was to achieve this goal that he published his major work ''On the Freedom of the Press and its Law'' ("Om Trykkefriheden og dens Love", 1797).

In this book he claims the importance of freedom of press as a powerful means of putting ideas into circulation and thereby enlighten the monarch of things that he would otherwise have been ignorant of. He also writes about it being a "revolution from above", when a "noble and patriotic" man, "brimming with feelings for the general good of man", at once appear among the powerful and without restraint "sacrifices his own splendor and absolutism". These words were aimed at the reigning crown prince [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederick]], who had shown considerable influences from the tolerant enlightenment ideas in his early years on the throne.

But Birckner does not only demand freedom to write about the affairs of government, he also demands freedom of speech in matters of religion. He shows that the way to achieve insight into the "moral truths" can only happen by discussing it in the open. However Birckner does propose some limits on the freedom of press, he does not think it should be allowed to publicly call for [[rebellion]], that is urging the people to overthrow the constitution of the state or in other ways oppose the actions of the government with physical force. Neither, Birckner says, should it be allowed to [[defamation|defame]] the private affairs of a man in his home, something which has no public interest and it violates the private sphere of the individual.

The book became a bestseller in Denmark-Norway. A second revised and improved edition appeared the same year, and a third printing was made for the first volume of the ''Collected Works'' of Birckner (a work which had 2.100 subscribers at the beginning of its publication, a very high figure in Danish literary history). Furthermore, he translated the book into German and it was printed in the German periodical ''Beiträge zur Verdlung die Menschheit'', 2. vol., 1. part, 1797, and the same year published as a stand-alone work under the title ''Ueber die Preszfreiheit und ihre Gesetze, von dem Verfasser selbst aus dem Dänishcen übersetzt, durchgesehen und herausgegeben von C.J.R. Christiani'', Kopenhagen und Leipzig.

These ideas met opposition from several contemporary writers. Some thought Birckner went too far in his support of free speech, while others thought there should be no limits whatsoever. This prompted Birckner to publish his ''Further Reflections on the Freedom of Press and its Laws'' ("Videre Undersøgelser om Trykkefriheden og dens Love") the following year (1798). His response is especially aimed at the criticism posed by professor [[Johan Frederik Vilhelm Schlegel]]. Only at one point in this book does he change his stance from his previous work, and that is only "half unwillingly" he thinks that writers who "with their filthy imagination attempts to awaken impure desires in his readers", these individuals should be sentenced "a fitting punishment". His "half unwillingness" for this stems from the fact that he sees "what the result would be, of such a power administered by the judges of geniuses, and how easily such a power can be abused most savagely... And yet, all art and beauty be damned, if it misleads just a single person to stray from the path of virtue".

== Death ==
His struggle for freedom of speech was not looked upon favorably in government circles. Nevertheless, he was appointed vicar of Vemmelev and Hammershøj 28 November 1798, an appointment that would have meant the end of his poverty. But this royal grace came too late, his illness had become lethal and he died 1 December the same year. His contribution to Danish literature was first acknowledged after his death. His friends praised his character and 2100 subscribers signed up for the first edition of his collected works. Furthermore, they collected 2500 [[Danish rigsdaler|rigsdaler]] that was donated to his grieving widow and children. .

== Collected works ==
Birckner had already begun working on a collected edition of his works prior to his death. This collection was to include all his writings except the two anonymous tracts against bishop Balle. He did manage to publish three volumes of this collection, and the fourth volume was published in 1800 edited by [[Anders Sandøe Ørsted]] and prefaced by an account of the last days of Birckner written by dean Frederik Carl Gutfeld (''Samlede Skrifter'', 4 vols., 1797-1800).

A '''necessary evil''' is an unsavoury thing (an [[evil]]) that someone believes must be done or accepted because it is [[Need|necessary]] to achieve a better outcome—especially because possible alternative courses of action or inaction are expected to be worse. It is the "lesser evil" in the [[lesser of two evils principle]], which provides that when given two bad choices, the one that is not as bad as the other is better than the one that is the greater threat.

==History==
The ''Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins'' asserts that "[t]he idea of a necessary evil goes back to Greek", describing the first necessary evil as [[marriage]], and further stating that, "The first example in English, from 1547, refers to a woman."&lt;ref&gt;Julia Cresswell, ''Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins'' (2010), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Fuller]], in his 1642 work, ''[[The Holy State and the Profane State]]'', made another of the earliest recorded uses of the phrase when he described the [[court jester]] as something that "...some count a necessary evil in a Court".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Fuller]], ''[[The Holy State and the Profane State]]'' (1642), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Common Sense]]'', [[Thomas Paine]] described [[government]] as at best a "necessary evil".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Van Ingram, ''Philosophy and Other Bad Habits'' (2011), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evil as a concept is defined by the fact of acts done, considered to be contrary to morality, in other words, [[sin|sinful]], and the execution of any act by an individual, the defining value of the act, is harm is done (in an [[Archaism|archaic]] sense, this indicates acts causing repulsion or discomfort), &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evil dictionary definition] [[Merriam-Webster]] Accessed February 11, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; additionally, the act is classified as, ''profoundly immoral''. &lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/evil dictionary definition] [[Oxford Dictionaries]] Accessed February 11, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

This being true, the use of the term "evil" in the phrase does not necessarily indicate that the thing being characterized as a "necessary evil" is something that is generally considered an "evil" in the sense of being [[immorality|immoral]] or the enemy of the good. In Fuller's use of the phrase, for example, there is no implication that court jesters are evil people, or having one serves an evil end. The term is most typically used to identify something that is merely an inconvenience or annoyance. Where an author suggests that, "[P]aperwork is a necessary evil, despised but handled with the understanding that a mistake – even a trivial one – could be costly."&lt;ref&gt;Sim B. Sitkin, Laura B. Cardinal, Katinka M. Bijlsma-Frankema, ''Organizational Control'' (2010), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; it is understood that the author is not deeming "[[wikt:paperwork|paperwork]]" to be wicked, immoral, or evil in senses comparable to those.Some thinkers specifically reject the idea of anything that is actually "evil" being necessary. This may manifest as an admonition for moral people to avoid participating in the activities that are perceived as evil:

{{quote|The concept of "necessary evil" is an idea that must be thoroughly rejected. Evil is not necessary, and to accept it as such is to perpetuate it. Evil must be opposed, rejected, and avoided at all costs. It should never be viewed as something that we must unavoidably and inevitably participate in. We trivialize evil when we refer to it as "necessary."&lt;ref&gt;Gebre Menfes Kidus, ''Mystery and Meaning: Christian Philosophy and Orthodox Meditations'' (2011), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alternately, this may manifest as a call to eliminate systems that contain aspects perceived as evil, and replace them with systems that avoid these aspects. For example, speaking of [[political parties]] in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], one author wrote:

{{quote|To say of anything that it is a necessary evil (it is often said of examinations, as of parties) is to give away all morality. It is almost a contradiction in terms. That which is necessary can hardly be evil. If that which is bad is unavoidable, then the game of morality is up. We are involved in a vicious circle from which there is no escape except in the denial of one premiss [sic] or of the other. Either the thing is not necessary, or it is not evil. A non-moral system might have no difficulty in admitting the conception of a necessary evil, but unfortunately it would also exclude the conception of evil altogether. Whatever may be argued philosophically on the point, the idea of a necessary evil is a fallacy as urged in excuse of party, for those who urge it are saying what they would deny if expressed in other terms.&lt;br&gt;

They would certainly say that it was wrong to charge a man with evil conduct who had done only what it was impossible for him to avoid doing. In that case they would say it was not evil; it was only unfortunate or sad. For the same reason party, if necessary, is not evil. But they do not want to say that, for they are convinced that party is an evil. Therefore they must take the alternative and admit that it is not necessary; and their excuse for party is gone.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Hodge, "Ex Parte" ''[[The Nineteenth Century (periodical)|The Nineteenth Century and After]]'' (1924), Vol. 95, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Italian physician [[Philip Mazzei]], in his correspondence with [[Thomas Jefferson]] in the 1770s, qualified a necessary evil as a restriction without which even greater evils would arise:

{{quote|Necessary Evils are those which cannot be avoided without incurring greater; Among the necessary Evils are the Laws themselves; because they prohibit us to do certain things, or oblige us to do certain others; and consequently they deprive us of a Portion of Liberty, which is the greatest Good. But what would be the Consequence if we had no Laws?&lt;ref&gt;Philip Mazzei, reported in Margherita Marchione and Stanley J. Idzerda, eds., ''Philip Mazzei: Selected Writings and Correspondence'' (1983), p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Nguyễn Thị Duệ''' (阮氏叡, 1574 – 1654) was a Vietnamese [[Queen consort|consort]] and female [[scholar]].&lt;ref name="free"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chimviet.free.fr/vanhoc/chquynh/loixua1/loixua06.htm#nguyenthidu|publisher=chimviet.free.fr|title= Nguyễn Thị Duệ as the first female doctor of Việt Nam |accessdate=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Nguyễn Thị Duệ has [[courtesy name]] '''Ngọc Toàn''' (玉全), [[pen name]] '''Diệu Huyền''' (妙玄), '''Đào Hoa Am''' (桃花庵). She was born in 1574 at Kiệt Đặc village, [[Chí Linh District|Bằng Châu]], [[Hải Dương|Dương Kinh]]. When was a child, she was known as intelligent and beautiful girl. However, Nguyễn Thị Duệ was only interested in the study.

In 1592, the capital [[Hanoi|Đông Kinh]] was captured by the [[Trịnh lords|Trịnh]] army but then he recaptured it year later. The [[Mạc dynasty|Mạc]] now lost all of [[Name of Vietnam|Việt Nam]] except for the areas around [[Cao Bằng Province|Cao Bình county]] which was under the formal protection of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] army. New [[Mạc dynasty|Mạc]] leader was [[Mạc Kính Chỉ]], then his son [[Mạc Kính Cung]]. They proclaimed as Vietnamese [[emperor]]s.

In this time, Nguyễn Thị Duệ's family ran after [[Mạc dynasty|Mạc]] lords to live in Cao Bình. In 1594, disguised as a man to take the [[Confucian examination system in Vietnam|Civil Service Exams]] by [[pseudonym]] '''Nguyễn Thị Du''' (阮氏瑜). She has passed the exam in rank doctor. However, her gender was discovered by emperor [[Mạc Kính Cung|Mạc Đại Tông]] at the imperial party. Then the emperor only complimented and asked her to teach his wives. Some months later, she also became the [[Queen consort|consort]] ''Nội-thị cung-tần'' (內侍宮嬪) by [[hereditary title]] '''Star Consort''' (星飛).

When Mạc's enemy annihilated her dynasty, Nguyễn Thị Duệ was taken captive. Instead of executing her, the invader installed her as an imperial tutor out of admiration for her intellect. At the court of emperor [[Lê Thần Tông]], she became the consort ''Chiêu-nghi'' (昭儀) by order of a new [[hereditary title]] '''Officer Nghi-ái''' (儀愛官).

'''''Phronesis''''' ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:φρόνησις|φρόνησῐς]]|phrónēsis}}) is an Ancient Greek word for a type of [[wisdom]] or [[intelligence]]. It is more specifically a type of wisdom relevant to practical action, implying both good judgement and excellence of character and habits, or practical virtue. Phronesis was a common topic of discussion in ancient Greek [[philosophy]]. 

The word was used in Greek philosophy, and such discussions are still influential today. In [[Aristotelian ethics]], for example in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', it is distinguished from other words for wisdom and intellectual [[virtue]]s – such as ''[[episteme]]'' and ''[[techne]]''. Because of its practical character, when it is not simply translated by words meaning wisdom or intelligence, it is often translated as "'''practical wisdom'''", and sometimes (more traditionally) as "[[prudence]]", from Latin {{lang|la|[[wikt:prudentia|prudentia]]}}. [[Thomas McEvilley]] has proposed that the best translation is "[[mindfulness]]".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas McEvilley, ''The Shape of Ancient Thought'', 2002, p. 609&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socratic philosophy==
===Plato===
In some of his dialogues, [[Plato]] showed his teacher [[Socrates]] proposing that having ''phronēsis'' is the same as being a virtuous person. By thinking with ''phronēsis'', a person has virtue. Therefore, all virtuousness is a form of phronēsis.&lt;ref&gt;W. K. C. Guthrie - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8EG0yV0cGoEC&amp;pg=PA348&amp;dq=phronesis+Socrates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FME7Vci1GI29aZzKgMAD&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=phronesis%20Socrates&amp;f=false A History of Greek Philosophy: Volume 6, Aristotle: An Encounter (p. 348)] Cambridge University Press, 29 Mar 1990 (reprint, revised) {{ISBN|0521387604}} [Retrieved 2015-04-25]&lt;/ref&gt; In the mind of Socrates ''phronēsis'' equals virtue, they are the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;T Engberg-Pedersen - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oj83D7aBgKMC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;dq=Phronesis+Socrates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CIM8Vb3jCofpaOCBAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Phronesis%20Socrates&amp;f=false Aristotle's Theory of Moral Insight (p. 236)] Oxford University Press, 1983 (reprint) {{ISBN|0198246676}} [Retrieved 2015-04-25]&lt;/ref&gt; Being good, is to be an intelligent or reasonable person with intelligent and reasonable thoughts. ''Phronēsis'' allows a person to have moral or ethical strength.&lt;ref&gt;CP. Long - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BwLQ_dxs3_UC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=phronesis+Socrates&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dSY4VfuZIMvgaPGJgPgB&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=phronesis%20Socrates&amp;f=false The Ethics of Ontology: A Structural Critique of the Carter and Reagan Years (p. 123)] SUNY Press, 1 Feb 2012 {{ISBN|0791484947}} [Retrieved 2015-04-22]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Plato's [[Meno]],  Socrates explains how ''phronēsis'', a quality synonymous with ''moral understanding'', is the most important attribute to learn, although it cannot be taught and is instead gained through the development of the understanding of one's own self.&lt;ref&gt;S Gallagher - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rnHarjbLwd0C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=Phronesis+Socrates&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dvzykne5BV&amp;sig=OzmQTFVqY9LzzxI_A2RTde82xlA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s4Q8VYjFJIbfatT_gNgC&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Phronesis%20Socrates&amp;f=false Hermeneutics and Education (''Self-understanding and phronēsis'' - pp. 197-99] SUNY Press, 1 Jan 1992 {{ISBN|0791411753}} [Retrieved 2015-04-26]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
In the 6th book of his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', Plato's student and friend [[Aristotle]] famously distinguished between two intellectual [[virtue]]s: ''[[Sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]'' (wisdom) and ''phronesis'', and described the relationship between them and other intellectual virtues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics#Book VI: Intellectual virtue|Nicomachean Ethics, Book 6]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sophia'' is a combination of [[nous]], the ability to discern reality, and ''epistēmē'', a type of knowledge which is logically built up and teachable, and which is sometimes equated with [[science]]. This involves reasoning concerning universal truths. ''Phronesis'' involves not only the ability to decide how to achieve a certain end, but also the ability to reflect upon and determine good ends consistent with the aim of [[eudaimonia|living well]] overall.&lt;ref&gt;NE VI 1140a, 1141b, 1142b&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle points out that although ''sophia'' is higher and more serious than ''phronesis'', the highest pursuit of wisdom and happiness requires both, because ''phronesis'' facilitates ''sophia''.&lt;ref&gt;NE VI.5.1142&lt;/ref&gt; He also associates ''phronesis'' with political ability.&lt;ref&gt;NE VI.5.1140b&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical===

According to Aristotle's theory of [[rhetoric]], ''phronesis'' is one of the three types of appeal to character (''[[ethos]]''). The other two are respectively appeals to ''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'' ([[virtue]]) and ''[[eunoia]]'' ([[Good faith|goodwill]]).{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Gaining ''phronesis'' requires experience, according to Aristotle who wrote that:&lt;blockquote&gt;...although the young may be experts in [[geometry]] and [[mathematics]] and similar branches of knowledge [''sophoi''], we do not consider that a young man can have Prudence [''phronimos'']. The reason is that Prudence [''phronesis''] includes a knowledge of particular facts, and this is derived from experience, which a young man does not possess; for experience is the fruit of years.&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker+page%3D1142a 1142a], Rackham translation with Greek key terms inserted in square brackets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Phronesis'' is concerned with particulars, because it is concerned with how to act in particular situations.  One can learn the principles of action, but applying them in the real world, in situations one could not have foreseen, requires experience of the world.  For example, if one knows that one should be honest, one might act in certain situations in ways that cause pain and offense; knowing how to apply honesty in balance with other considerations and in specific contexts requires experience.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Aristotle holds that having ''phronesis'' is both [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary and sufficient]] for being virtuous; because ''phronesis'' is practical, it is impossible to be both ''phronetic'' and [[Akrasia|akratic]]; i.e., prudent persons cannot act against their "better judgement."

==Modern discussion==
===Heidegger===
In light of his [[fundamental ontology]], [[Martin Heidegger]] interprets Aristotle in such a way that ''phronesis'' (and practical philosophy as such) is the original form of knowledge and thus primary to ''sophia'' (and theoretical philosophy).&lt;ref&gt;Günter Figal, ''Martin Heidegger zur Einführung'', Hamburg 2003, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidegger interprets the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' as an ontology of Human Existence.  The practical philosophy of Aristotle is a guiding thread in his Analysis of Existence  according to which facticity names our unique mode of being in the world. Through his ‘existential analytic’, Heidegger recognises that ‘Aristotelian [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]’ suggests three fundamental movements of life including ''póiesis'', ''práxis'', ''theoría'' and that these have three corresponding dispositions: ''téchne'', ''phrónesis'' and ''sophía''. Heidegger considers these as modalities of Being inherent in the structure of ''‘[[Dasein]]’'' as being-in-the-world that is situated within the context of concern and care. According to Heidegger phronesis in Aristotle’s work discloses the right and proper way to be ''Dasein''. Heidegger sees phronesis as a mode of comportment in and toward the world, a way of orienting oneself and thus of caring-seeing-knowing and enabling a particular way of being concerned. 

While ''[[techne]]'' is a way of being concerned with things and principles of production and theoria a way of being concerned with eternal principles, phronesis is a way of being concerned with one’s life (qua action) and with the lives of others and all particular circumstances as purview of praxis. Phronesis is a disposition or habit, which reveals the being of the action while deliberation is the mode of bringing about the disclosive appropriation of that action. In other words, deliberation is the way in which the phronetic nature of ''Dasein’s'' insight is made manifest. 

Phronesis is a form of circumspection, connected to conscience and resoluteness respectively being-resolved in action of human existence (''Dasein'') as ''práxis''. As such it discloses the concrete possibilities of being in a situation, as the starting point of meaningful action, processed with resolution, while facing the contingencies of life.
However Heidegger’s ontologisation has been criticised as closing ''práxis'' within a horizon of solipsistic decision that deforms its political sense that is its practico-political configuration (Volpi, 2007).
&lt;ref&gt;Franco Volpi (2007) 'In Whose Name?: Heidegger and "Practical Philosophy"', ''European Journal of Political Theory'' 6:1, 31-51,&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the social sciences==
In ''[[After Virtue]]'', [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] called for a phronetic social science. He points out that for every prediction made by a social scientific theory there are usually [[counter-example]]s. Hence the [[unpredictability]] of human beings and human life requires a focus on practical experiences.

'''Pierre Hadot''' ({{IPAc-en|ɑː|ˈ|d|oʊ}}; {{IPA-fr|ado|lang}}; February 21, 1922 &amp;ndash; April 24, 2010) was a [[French people|French]] [[philosopher]] and [[history of philosophy|historian of philosophy]] specializing in [[ancient philosophy]], particularly [[Neoplatonism]].

==Life==
In 1944, Hadot was ordained, but following [[Pope Pius XII]]’s encyclical ''[[Humani generis]]'' (1950) left the priesthood. He studied at the [[Sorbonne]] between 1946–1947.&lt;ref name='post278'/&gt; In 1961, he graduated from the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]],&lt;ref name='post278'/&gt; where he would become the Director of Studies from 1964 to 1986. He was eventually named professor at the [[Collège de France]] in 1982, where he held the Chair of History in Hellenistic and Roman Thought (''chaire d'histoire de la pensée hellénistique et romaine''). In 1991, he retired from this position to become ''professeur honoraire'' at the collège; his last lecture was on May 22 of the same year. He concluded the class saying, "In the last analysis, we can scarcely talk about what is most important."&lt;ref name='post284'&gt;Pierre Hadot, ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995.&lt;br&gt;''Postscript: An Interview with Pierre Hadot'', p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadot was married to the historian of philosophy, Ilsetraut Hadot.

==Thought==
Hadot was one of the first authors to introduce [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s thought into France. Hadot suggested that one cannot separate the form of Wittgenstein's ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' from their content.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;Davidson, A.I. (1995), Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy, in ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', Hadot, P., Oxford Blackwells pp17-18&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein had claimed that philosophy was an illness of language and Hadot notes that the cure required a particular type of literary genre.&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt;

Hadot is also famous for his analysis on the conception of philosophy during [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman antiquity]].  Hadot identified and analyzed the "spiritual exercises" used in [[ancient philosophy]] (influencing the thought of [[Michel Foucault]] in the second and third volumes of his ''[[History of Sexuality]]''). By "spiritual exercises" Hadot means "practices ... intended to effect a modification and a transformation in the subjects who practice them.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot, P. (1995), ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', Oxford, Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy teacher's discourse could be presented in such a way that the disciple, as auditor, reader, or interlocutor, could make spiritual progress and transform himself within."&lt;ref name="Hadot"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hadot |first=Pierre |year=2002 |title=What Is Ancient Philosophy? |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=6 |ISBN=0-674-00733-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hadot shows that the key to understanding the original philosophical impulse is to be found  in [[Socrates]]. What characterizes Socratic therapy above all is the importance given to living contact between human beings.

Hadot's recurring theme is that philosophy in Antiquity was characterized by a series of spiritual exercises intended to transform the perception, and therefore the being, of those who practice it; that philosophy is best pursued in real conversation and not through written texts and lectures; and that philosophy, as it is taught in universities today, is for the most part a distortion of its original, therapeutic impulse. He brings these concerns together in ''What Is Ancient Philosophy?'',&lt;ref name="Hadot"/&gt; which has been critically reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23663-what-is-ancient-philosophy/ |last=Zeyl |first=Donald |title=What is Ancient Philosophy? |date=June 9, 2003 |website=[[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]] |accessdate=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Policraticus''''' was the first book of [[political science]] to be produced during the [[Middle Ages]]. Written by [[John of Salisbury]] around 1159, it belongs to the genre of advice literature known as "[[Mirrors for princes|mirrors for princes"]], and is addressed to the territorial ruler. Though it takes up a wide variety of ethical questions, it is most famous for attempting to define the responsibilities of [[Monarch|kings]] and their relationship to their subjects. 

==Definitions==
Policraticus is a pseudo [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] [[neologism]] term, meaning "the statesman." Salisbury drew his arguments from several different sources, including the [[Bible]] and the [[Justinian Code]]. He argued for the [[divine right of kings]], saying that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the prince stands on a pinnacle which is exalted and made splendid with all the great and high privileges which he deems necessary for himself. And rightly so, because nothing is more advantageous to the people than that the needs of the prince should be fully satisfied; since it is impossible that his will should be found opposed to justice. Therefore, according to the usual definition, the prince is the public power, and a kind of likeness on earth of the divine majesty. Beyond doubt a large share of the divine power is shown to be in princes by the fact that at their nod men bow their necks and for the most part offer up their heads to the axe to be struck off, and, as by a divine impulse, the prince is feared by each of those over whom he is set as an object of fear. And this I do not think could be, except as a result of the will of God. For all power is from the Lord God, and has been with Him always, and is from everlasting.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This divine source allowed princes to wage [[Just War|just wars]] and required all subjects to submit to the prince's will.  Salisbury argued that the prince had four responsibilities: Revere [[God]],  adore his subjects, exert self-discipline and instruct his ministers.  Salisbury advocated strict punishments for [[lèse majesté]], but argued that a prince should err on the side of mercy and compassion when enforcing his laws.

==Tyrannicide==

While recognizing a prince's supreme temporal power, Salisbury argued that princes must be subordinate to the will of God and the Church.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For myself, I am satisfied and persuaded that loyal shoulders should uphold the power of the ruler; and not only do I submit to his power patiently, but with pleasure, so long as it is exercised in subjection to God and follows His ordinances. But on the other hand if it resists and opposes the divine commandments, and wishes to make me share in its war against God; then with unrestrained voice I answer back that God must be preferred before any man on earth. Therefore inferiors should cleave and cohere to their superiors, and all the limbs should be in subjection to the head; but always and only on condition that religion is kept inviolate.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In Salisbury's mind, a tyrant sets a poor example for his people and could lead them from God.  His example was the Roman Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]], who attempted to restore Rome's [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] religion.  In this case, Salisbury argued that killing a regent, when all other resources were exhausted, was not only justifiable but necessary, and he called a tyrant an "image of depravity . . . [who] spring(s) from evil and should be cut down with the axe wherever he grows."  This may be the first defense of [[tyrannicide]] to be written after [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]].

'''''Poor Dionis''''' or '''''Poor Dionysus''''' ({{lang-ro|Sărmanul Dionis}}, originally spelled ''Sermanul Dionisie'';&lt;ref name="vcjurnalul"&gt;{{ro icon}} Valentin Coșereanu, [http://caietecritice.fnsa.ro/pdfs/cc%206%202010.pdf "Jurnalul Junimii"], in ''Caiete Critice'', Nr. 6/2010, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1943), p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; also translated as ''Wretched Dionysus'' or ''The Sorrowful Dionis'') is an [[1872 in literature|1872]] prose work by [[Romania]]n poet [[Mihai Eminescu]], classified by scholars as either a novel, a [[novella]] or a modern [[fairy tale]]. It is a liberal interpretation of contemporary [[German philosophy]] and ancient motifs, discussing themes such as [[time travel]] and [[reincarnation]] through the lens of [[German idealism|post-Kantian idealism]]. Its eponymous central character, a daydreaming scholar, moves between selves over time and space, between his miserable home, his earlier existence as a monk in 15th-century [[Moldavia]], and his higher-level existence as a celestial [[Zoroaster]].

''Poor Dionis'' is one of the first, and most characteristic, works of [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] in [[Romanian literature]], and one of the poet's last [[Romanticism|Romantic]] texts. Beyond its philosophical vocabulary, the story is Eminescu's [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] homage to the founders of [[German Romanticism]] ([[E. T. A. Hoffman]], [[Novalis]]) and [[19th-century French literature|modern French literature]] ([[Théophile Gautier]]). Read out by Eminescu upon his induction to ''[[Junimea]]'' literary club, it was dismissed as an incoherent oddity by critics of the day, and overlooked by researchers before 1900. It was then reevaluated by successive generations, beginning with the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolists]], serving to inspire both the [[Modernist literature|modernists]] and the [[Postmodern literature|postmodernists]].

Traditionally, ''Poor Dionis'' has intrigued researchers with its cultural complexity, discussed in connection with the [[Vedanta]], [[Gnosticism]], or the [[theory of relativity]]. Its unreliable depiction of the historical past is also noted in connection with [[invented tradition]], in the context of [[Romanian nationalism]], while its depiction of mundane contemporary scenes may offer [[autofiction]]al insight into Eminescu's biography. Its favorable depiction of Jews and [[Judaism]] also caught attention, and was held in contrast to other works by Eminescu, which border on antisemitism. Various scholars, however, see ''Poor Dionis'' mainly as a work of sheer literary fancy.

==Plot==
Eminescu begins his story in mid-thought,&lt;ref&gt;Full version published in ''Antologia nuvelei fantastice'', pp. 691–726, with some of Eminescu's typographical preferences. English translations by Florin Bican ("The Sorrowful Dionis", in ''Plural Magazine'', Nr. 4/1999, pp. 13–44) and Peter Mamara ([https://web.archive.org/web/20081231083006/http://www.globusz.com/ebooks/Dionysus/Dionysus.htm ''Poor Dionysus''], [http://www.globusz.com/ Globusz Publishing] version)&lt;/ref&gt; with first-person musings about [[subjectivity]], ''[[qualia]]'', [[time perception]], and the physical world being "[[Dream argument|our soul's dream]]". The narrator then reveals that this is a quote from the amateur [[Metaphysics|metaphysician]] Dionis. He describes the latter as an unkempt, but good looking, young [[Bucharest]]er, reduced to poverty and prone to daydreaming. He is an orphan, born out of wedlock to a mysterious aristocrat and a priest's daughter. Although a passionate [[Esotericism|esotericist]] and reader of sacred books, Dionis is more of "a superstitious atheist".

In his miserable room, Dionis is studying an [[almanac]] of [[astrology]], and listening, through the open window, to a girl singing; charmed by the sound, he sees (or imagines) the girl as a modern-day [[Ophelia]]. In this reverie, his eyes affixed on the zodiac, Dionis understands that he can freely travel back into the glorified past. He chooses for his destination ancient Moldavia, under the rule of [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Alexander the Good]]. When he awakens, he finds himself on a meadow near [[Iași]], dressed in [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] monastic clothes, and grasping the almanac. He is Friar Dan, who he has only dreamed of being Dionis, and the book is a present from his teacher, Ruben.

[[File:ClavisArtis.MS.Verginelli-Rota.V1.003r.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Zoroaster]], as depicted in the 18th-century German [[Alchemy|alchemical]] treatise, ''Clavis Artis'']]
Ruben, a learned and pious [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jew]] living in exile at the "[[Socola Monastery|Socola Academy]]", has instructed his favorite pupil about "[[metempsychosis]]" and [[Apport (paranormal)|apport]]: "you can slip into the lives of all the ones who led up to your life [and] into all the future lives caused by your present life"; "you can go any place you want, although you cannot leave it void behind you. [...] there's no such thing as fully vacant space." Simultaneous travel in [[spacetime]], Ruben teaches, may only happen if one changes places with one's ancestors or descendants. Taking the Dionis experience as evidence that Ruben is right, Dan asks to be transported into an ideal universe, and is told by his master that such a place exists "in your immortal soul". If Dan wishes to reach it, he is to read every seventh page of a [[Magical formula|spell]] book: each will take him to a new place, in no known order, and no location can be visited twice. After Dan leaves, book in hand, Ruben is revealed to have been possessed by [[Satan]], who takes joy at having ensnared a pious monk: the book is in fact an instrument of perdition.

Back in his room, Dan decides to use the book for an egotistic purpose. He is in love with Maria, daughter of ''[[Spatharios]]'' Mesteacăn, and secretly wishes to kidnap her. As Dan weighs in the possibilities, his own shadow begins talking to him, telling him that the book he read was written by the prophet [[Zoroaster]]; and that he, Dan, as the reincarnation of Zoroaster, is entitled to use the book as he pleases. The monk and his shadow strike a deal: Dan will assign his mortal's identity to the shadow, while he himself will become a "[[Subtle body|shape of light]]", with the shadow's power to transcendent. Under this guise, Dionis visits Maria, and persuades her to make a similar exchange with her own shadow.

As a new Zoroaster, Dan carries his lover to the moon. No longer held back by the laws of physics, he rearranges the celestial sphere and the lunar landscape for Maria's pleasure, building her a heavenly abode, serviced by the angels and decorated with [[blue flower]]s; in this arrangement, Earth itself is a contemptible atom, consumed by hatred and war. Dan finds that the entire cosmos is his, except for the inaccessible "dome of God". He becomes obsessed with looking upon the [[divine countenance]], and with reshaping the angels into instruments of his will; Dan begins to formulate a thought, that he himself may be God, and may not be remembering as much.

With this (half-uttered) blasphemy, everything is lost. Feeling himself expelled from Heaven, Dan reawakens as Dionis, and catches a glimpse of the singing girl: "Ophelia" is Dan's Maria. Still confused by his apparent change of status, and not being sure of himself, Dionis decides to write her a letter, confessing his affection. When, from the window, she shows him that the letter has impressed her, Dionis faints with emotion. He is carried to hospital by concerned philanthropists and makes a slow recovery, while Maria secretly arranges to have his room cleaned and refurbished. Dionis wakes up in a beautified home, with Maria watching over him. They become lovers.

In medieval Iași, Dan also experiences a rude awakening, and, like Dionis, is apparently ill. He is visited by a Jewish man, whom he takes for a ''[[kaftan]]''- and ''[[payot]]''-wearing Ruben—telling him that the shadow he left behind has written a precious memoir. "Ruben" reveals himself to be his book vendor, Riven, and denies any knowledge of their dialogues on metempsychosis. Despondent, Dan begins to suspect that he has been tricked by devils. Eminescu ends his account with a series of open questions, without revealing any explicit moral to the story.

==Publication history and poetic footnote==
The narrative came with Eminescu's "conclusive notes", and ends with a quote from Romantic poet [[Théophile Gautier]], in Eminescu's own translation. They trace back a letter on drama, addressed to [[Gérard de Nerval]] and first published in the 1858 ''Histoire de l'art dramatique en France depuis vingt-cinq ans III''.&lt;ref&gt;Simion, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the fragment reads:

Eminescu finished writing his story during an extended study trip to [[Vienna]]. Reportedly, he first read it to friend and fellow writer [[Ioan Slavici]], whose comments inaugurated a long sequence of negative criticism: at the time, Slavici described the work as merely "bizarre".&lt;ref&gt;Simion, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Another Romanian colleague in Vienna, linguist [[Vasile Burlă]], also found ''Poor Dionis'' to be of an "extravagant and sensationalistic" Romantic nature.&lt;ref&gt;Iulian Negrilă, "M. Eminescu – student la Viena și Berlin", in ''Studii de Știință și Cultură'', Nr. 1/2008, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Their claim to have known the work in its early stages is contrasted by the recollections of yet another Vienna student, [[Teodor V. Ștefanelli]]. He writes: "Eminescu never shared with anyone what he was writing on, and if he had written something he would not even show it to his roommates, but locked away his manuscript. Hence, we got to know of ''Poor Dionis'' and all his poetry [of the period] only in their printed form."&lt;ref&gt;[[Teodor V. Ștefanelli]], ''Amintiri despre Eminescu'', p. 71. Bucharest: Institutul de Arte Grafice C. Sfetea, 1914&lt;/ref&gt;

Eminescu made a trip back to the country and, on September 1, 1872, read the story to his patrons at ''[[Junimea]]''—his "first-ever personal contact" with that literary club.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1943), pp. 28, 145&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Junimea'' literati gave ''Poor Dionis'' a lukewarm reception. As recorded by the society's official diary, ''Junimist'' doyens [[Titu Maiorescu]] and [[Vasile Pogor]] both noted that "the ending and the resolution do not match into the whole structure".&lt;ref name="vcjurnalul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1943), p. 151; Perpessicius, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[Alexandru Piru]], such reactions were merely myopic: "The ''Junimists'' [...] did not notice that, at heart, with his use of fairy tale settings, Eminescu depicted the fate of the genius artist whom a hostile environment has condemned to a chimerical, deplorable, life."&lt;ref name="Piru, p. 190"&gt;Piru, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Maiorescu and Pogor agreed to serialize ''Poor Dionis'' in the club's magazine, ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', where the first episode appeared on December 1, 1872.&lt;ref name="ippoetul"/&gt;

One particularly virulent account of the ''Junimea'' reading survives in the memoirs of [[George Panu]]. Claiming to speak for the entire group, Panu recounted that the work read like "a philosophical aberration", "as weak as they get", without "at least the characteristics of a fantasy novella".&lt;ref&gt;Simion, pp. 222–223. See also Botez, pp. 11–12; Lovinescu (1943), pp. 25–28, 148–152; Perpessicius, pp. 167–168, 195, 469–471&lt;/ref&gt; Eminescu's biographers have dismissed Panu's claim as mystification. A lively opponent of Eminescu's [[national conservatism]], Panu was not even in contact with ''Junimea'' when ''Poor Dionis'' was being presented for review.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1943), pp. 25–28, 148–152; Perpessicius, pp. 145, 167–170, 469–471; Simion, p. 223; {{ro icon}} Teodor Vârgolici, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/memorialiti_romni "Memorialiști români"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 12/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Not discouraged by the reception, Eminescu responded with a subtle satire, meant to be read as an addendum to ''Poor Dionis'': ''Cugetările Sărmanului Dionis'' ("Poor Dionis' Musings"). It was interwoven into the first installment of the story as published in ''Convorbiri Literare''.&lt;ref name="Piru, p. 190"/&gt;

==Themes==
''Poor Dionis'' remains a pioneering work in the [[Fantasy literature|fantasy]] and Romantic-era sub-chapters of [[Romanian literature]]. Romanian scholar [[Zoe Dumitrescu-Bușulenga]] describes Eminescu's "grand novella" as "one of the most beautiful and most particular works of European Romanticism".&lt;ref name="Dumitrescu-Bușulenga, p. 64"&gt;Dumitrescu-Bușulenga, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Luisa Valmarin, the Italian philologist, calls Eminescu's work "the only philosophical novella produced by Romanian Romanticism".&lt;ref name="Valmarin, p. 70"&gt;Valmarin, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Among the scholars who regard the story as primarily a novel, [[Eugen Lovinescu]] also described Dionis as one of the first and most important protagonists of the genre, as it had developed in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/de_ce_l-a_ignorat_lovinescu_pe_slavici "De ce l-a ignorat Lovinescu pe Slavici?"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 3/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing ''Junimea''{{'}}s reaction, the same Lovinescu also noted that ''Poor Dionis'' carried with it a [[culture shock]], exposing Romania to "Eminescu's hurricane of genius, bringing in all the elements of German sentimentality, filtered through a singular, personal, temperament."&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1943), p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

The story signals some essential transitions in Eminescu's work. Luisa Valmarin writes that Eminescu stepped up from his early representations of the occult: in ''[[Strigoii]]'', the theme reconstructs an ancient mythology; in ''Poor Dionis'', occult symbols are borrowed for an actual escape into a magical universe.&lt;ref&gt;Valmarin, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; The move, she notes, "prefigures" Eminescu's poems.&lt;ref name="Valmarin, p. 70"/&gt; Somewhat different accounts are provided by scholars [[George Călinescu]] and [[Eugen Simion]]: the poem "Mirodonis", adapted from earlier [[Romanian folklore]], seems to them a direct precursor of the Dionis narrative, especially when it comes to the poetic landscape.&lt;ref&gt;G. Călinescu, p. 20; Simion, pp. 235–236&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers, beginning with [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], also describe ''Poor Dionis'' as a reprisal of Eminescu's "youthful novel", ''Geniu pustiu'', from which it borrowed whole fragments.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, pp. 126–127, 130–134; Perpessicius, pp. 132, 163, 170, 172, 195, 456, 465, 472–474&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical novel===
[[File:Michelangelo - Dream of Life NG8.jpg|thumb|270px|''The Dream of Life'', by unknown [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] painter, ca. 1533]]
''Poor Dionis'' is rated by some exegetes (including Indian philologist [[Amita Bhose]])&lt;ref name="sgdindia"&gt;{{ro icon}} Simona Grazia Dima, [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=2414&amp;editie=105 "Eminescu și filozofiile Indiei"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 30/2010&lt;/ref&gt; as primarily a work of [[philosophical fiction]]. The historian and critic [[Nicolae Iorga]] merely saw the work as "illegible, were it not for the beauty of each passage".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Any complex idea, Iorga argues, only spoke of Eminescu's fascination with philosophical tropes, and came out as "bizarre".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nae Ionescu]], the controversial essayist and logician, also declared the work to be philosophically ambitious, but incoherent: "All the discouraging lack of logic that characterizes this short story stands as evidence in anyone's eyes that Eminescu was not a philosopher."&lt;ref name="gtnaeopere6"&gt;{{ro icon}} Gabriela Trifescu, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/PUBLICISTICA.-Nae-IONESCU-Opere-VI-Publicistica-1-1909-1923*articleID_6645-articles_details.html "Publicistică. Nae Ionescu, ''Opere VI, Publicistică 1, 1909–1923''"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 12, May 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In his view, Eminescu merely tried to give a literary representation to [[Kantianism]], and imitate the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''.&lt;ref name="gtnaeopere6"/&gt; Philologist [[Alexandru Al. Philippide]] supposes that some "subtle philosophical undertones" might still exist in the account, but "when it comes to the artistic achievement, the fairy tale most definitely enjoys primacy."&lt;ref&gt;Philippide, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The same conclusion is drawn by his colleague [[Perpessicius]], who notes that any Kantian overtones are submerged under "the prestige of the fairy tale."&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 169–172, 471–473&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantin Noica]] took the work's ambitions more seriously, noting Eminescu's subtlety in rendering concepts that were new to [[Romanian philosophy]], in particular his attempt to coin the term ''nefinire'' for "[[infinite divisibility]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin Noica]], ''Cuvânt împreună despre rostirea românească'', pp. 73–80. Bucharest: [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], 1996.  {{ISBN|973-28-0643-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others suggest that the doubling of Dionis' being is not necessarily a purist philosophical commentary, and may in fact be tongue-in-cheek. Philosopher [[Horia-Roman Patapievici]] notes that, upon first reading the story as an adolescent, he traced its links with the views of [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Revisiting the project in 1996, he comments: "I am no wiser today as to whether this thought is mere idiocy or not".&lt;ref&gt;[[Horia-Roman Patapievici]], ''Flying Against the Arrow: An Intellectual in Ceaușescu's Romania'', p. 140. Budapest &amp; New York City: [[Central European University Press]], 2003.  {{ISBN|963-9116-57-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dionis' detachment from his shadow may be a discreet self-mockery on Eminescu's part, as suggested by literary historians like [[Tudor Vianu]] and [[Vera Călin]]. They note that Eminescu follows to the letter a Romantic critique of the [[Category (Kant)|Kantian framework]], wherein space and time are merely subjective realities.&lt;ref&gt;Călin, pp. 197–198&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, critic [[Henric Sanielevici]] viewed the story as mainly a record of Dionis' break with [[positivism]], his "pulling into the past by an invisible hand."&lt;ref&gt;Botez, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

A trenchant point of view on the matter is expressed by G. Călinescu. ''Poor Dionis'', he writes, is merely "a fantasy novella à la [[Théophile Gautier]]", and, for all of Eminescu's [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] clues, the [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]] of Kantian concepts cannot function. According to G. Călinescu's verdicts, Kant did not view time as subjective, but rather as a subject of physical phenomena—Eminescu's interpretation comes from Kantian critics like [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|J. Fichte]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Călinescu, pp. 34–35; Simion, pp. 224–226, 235&lt;/ref&gt; Whether ''Poor Dionis'' is Kantian or Schopenhauerian has been the topic of dispute among other critics—according to philosopher Angela Botez, this is mainly because Schopenhauer, who fascinated young Eminescu, borrowed and revolutionized some of the core Kantian ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Botez, pp. 5–9&lt;/ref&gt; "In truth", she notes, "from the philosophical musings that introduce the novella, and down to Dionis' [[metempsychosis]], all this chaotic story is a powerful echo of [[Arthur Schopenhauer's criticism of Immanuel Kant's schemata|Schopenhauerian philosophical categories]]."&lt;ref&gt;Botez, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after ''Poor Dionis'', Eminescu penned a dialogue, ''Archaeus'', which ridiculed Kant's [[transcendental idealism]], suggesting that even a [[Goose|gander]] could be better trusted to understand the world. According to Perpessicius, this piece is "tied to ''Poor Dionis'' by direct threads".&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 173–174, 475–476&lt;/ref&gt;

Various historiographers note that the concept of [[Dream argument|dreamed world]] precedes the German school by several generations, finding its literary expression in [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]]'s [[Life is a Dream|1635 allegory]], before arriving at Gautier.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlicencu, p. 32; Simion, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Eminescu's own perception of [[spacetime]], as apparent in the story and in some poems (''[[La steaua]]'', for instance), has intrigued Romanian students of physics, particularly after they became aware of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]]. In 1928, Einstein received a letter from his Romanian admirer, Melania Șerbu, who informed him that ''Poor Dionis'' had anticipated his finds; Einstein kept corresponding with Șerbu, but did not show an interest in reading the story.&lt;ref name="smeinstein"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Solomon Marcus]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/scrisori_ctre_i_de_la_albert_einstein "Scrisori către și de la Albert Einstein"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 28/2006&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to investigating such connections herself,&lt;ref name="smeinstein"/&gt; critic [[Ioana Em. Petrescu]] believed that the modern interest of ''Poor Dionis'', and of Eminescu's work in general, was given by its multiple levels, and especially by its [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] suggestions. In her view, Zoroaster's book is a mirror of the world symbol, as in the [[deconstruction]] terminology coined by [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref name="arpreatanara15"&gt;{{ro icon}} Alexandru Ruja, [http://www.revistaorizont.ro/arhiva/februarie2007.pdf "Preatânăra doamnă"], in ''[[Orizont]]'', Nr. 2/2007, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The story's various folkloric reminiscences are in part introduced by Romantic localism. They reach down through [[Christian mythology]], into [[New Testament apocrypha|apocrypha]], [[Christian heresy|heresy]] and [[Gnosticism]]. In the 1960s, academic Rosa del Conte proposed that the text alluded to [[Babylonian religion]], [[Buddhism]], [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], [[Mithraism]], and [[Bogomilism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Gogâță, [http://studia.ubbcluj.ro/download/pdf/638.pdf "Rosa del Conte, ''Eminescu or about the Absolute'' — Establishing Specificity in a European Context"], in ''Studia Universitatis Babeș-Bolyai. Philologia'', Vol. 56, Issue 3, September 2011, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Philologist Anca Voicu also writes that the Gnostic source, a borrowing from the "[[Sophia (Gnosticism)|fall of Sophia]]" myth (with some echoes from the [[Book of Proverbs]] and other orthodox writs), is ''Poor Dionis''{{'}}s very "narrative matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Anca Voicu, [http://astra.iasi.roedu.net/constelatiiiesene/pdf/CI-Nr11-12Pag46-49.pdf "Dionis reiterează mitul Sophiei gnostice"], in ''Constelații Ieșene'', Nr. 3-4/2008, pp. 46–49&lt;/ref&gt; The angels' description is picked up directly from the [[Apocalypse of Paul]],&lt;ref name="Dumitrescu-Bușulenga, p. 64"/&gt; while the moonscape replicates visions of paradise found in ancestral Romanian stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Horia-Roman Patapievici]], [http://www.revistaorizont.ro/arhiva/aprilie2012.pdf "Eminescu și viziunea paradiziacă"], in ''[[Orizont]]'', Nr. 4/2012, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Ruben's hybrid appearance also follows early Romanian ideas about the physical attributes of wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Simion, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal of an unreachable but desirable lady, seen from below, is described by historian of culture [[Ioan P. Culianu]] as a nod in the direction of [[damsel in distress]] mythology.&lt;ref name="ipcemineros"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioan P. Culianu]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Fantasmele-erosului-la-Eminescu.-Poemul-Luceafarul*articleID_6272-articles_details.html "Fantasmele erosului la Eminescu. Poemul ''Luceafărul''"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 15, June 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the Eminescu scholars, Bhose has pleaded for the work to be seen as one of Eminescu's [[Hinduism in Romania|Hindu-inspired]] contributions. She believes that, beyond adopting Kantian and Schopenhauerian discourse, ''Poor Dionis'' incorporates echoes from [[Vedanta]] philosophy and the [[Upanishads]] (known to have been read in translation by young Eminescu), even though, she asserts, the text does not follow such ideas to the letter.&lt;ref name="sgdindia"/&gt; Bhose sees the novella as akin to the ''[[Advaita Vedanta]]'', the metaphysical school of [[Adi Shankara]]. Shankara preached that all the selves in the cosmos are reflections of a [[Para Brahman|formless divine presence]].&lt;ref name="sgdindia"/&gt; Also according to Bhose, concepts such as [[time perception]] and reincarnation came to Eminescu by way of [[Hindu philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Marian, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romantic satire and proto-Symbolist work===
Beyond its seeming cultivation of German philosophy, ''Poor Dionis'' is stylistically an homage to [[German Romanticism]]. It is most closely related to late-18th-century fantasy works by [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] or [[Novalis]]. Among the Eminescu scholars, Perpessicius, Philippide, Simion and Constantin Ciopraga see a special connection between Dionis and [[Heinrich von Ofterdingen]], the "[[Blue Flower]]" minstrel of Novalis' prose.&lt;ref&gt;Ciopraga, p. 169; Perpessicius, p. 171; Philippide, p. 49; Simion, pp. 220, 228&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this floral motif, Eminescu takes from Novalis the whole narrative device of [[dream sequence]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Ciopraga, pp. 169, 170–171, 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Uchronia|uchronic worldview]] of "magical idealism".&lt;ref&gt;Simion, pp. 226–228&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Adelbert von Chamisso]], the Romanian writer borrowed a "[[Peter Schlemiel|man without a shadow]]" motif that had already inspired him to write the 1869 short story "My Shadow".&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 173–174, 475; Simion, pp. 219–222, 232–235&lt;/ref&gt; Eminescu's characterology is described by several authors as a nod in the direction of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|J. W. Goethe]] and his ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', which also tells the story of an ill-adjusted savant reclaiming the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandru Bogdan, "Mihail Eminescu, ''Strigoii''. (Sfârșit).", in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 5/1909, p. 389; Botez, p. 10; Iorga, p. 146; Simion, pp. 223, 233, 237, 240–242&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumitrescu-Bușulenga proposes that Eminescu's Hoffmann-like Romanticism, with more distant echoes from [[Gothic fiction]], takes on German philosophical concepts only as a literary device,&lt;ref name="Dumitrescu-Bușulenga, p. 64"/&gt; while [[Comparative literature|comparatist]] [[Matei Călinescu]] sees both Hoffmann and Eminescu as authors interested in the "absurd" side of fantasy. He argues that, in ''Poor Dionis'', readers are slowly immersed into "a mellow chaos of signs", rather than confronted with sheer Gothic terror.&lt;ref&gt;''Antologia nuvelei fantastice'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; As read by Botez, the resolution of ''Poor Dionis'' appears to be "mocking the readers" and their expectation of logical coherence. Following patterns found in Hoffmann and [[Jean Paul]], this technique also announced developments in [[postmodern literature]].&lt;ref&gt;Botez, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cugetările'', a rhyming companion to the novella, have thus been read as "typically Romantic" self-irony,&lt;ref name="Piru, p. 190"/&gt; "bohemian cynicism",&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 179, 480&lt;/ref&gt; or a "grave parody".&lt;ref&gt;Simion, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vera Călin, the addendum "wittingly paraphrases" Schopenhauerian philosophy, in the playful key of ''[[The Life and Opinions of the Tomcat Murr|Tomcat Murr]]''.&lt;ref name="Călin, p. 196"&gt;Călin, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; The core stanzas are Eminescu's mock defense of an idle and imbecilic feline, who may be the dreamer of the world:

The joke is on several poets cultivated by ''Junimea'', who were entirely different in style and approach. Draft versions of the poem specify the main targets: ''Junimist'' poet-soldier [[Theodor Șerbănescu]], and, beyond him, the "[[Young Germany]]" idol [[Heinrich Heine]].&lt;ref&gt;Piru, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Cugetările'', Eminescu introduces the derisive [[neologism]]s ''a heiniza'', "to Heinefy", and ''motănime'', "cat swarm", which alternate and contrast with words from the deeper layers of the [[Romanian lexis]].&lt;ref&gt;Sorina Florea (Darie), "Neologisme, xenisme și pancronisme în ''Sărmanul Dionis'', de Mihai Eminescu", in ''Revista Română'' ([[Asociația Transilvană pentru Literatura Română și Cultura Poporului Român|ASTRA]]), Nr. 2/2010, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt; Like some German theorists of the day, Eminescu was convinced that "gen'rous youngsters" everywhere had made it their mission to destroy civilization, referring to them as "idiots" with "rotten bodies";&lt;ref&gt;Piru, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt; as noted by scholar [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], Dionis is ostensibly a poet by vocation, capable of putting together accomplished verse on a dare.&lt;ref name="ippoetul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/poetul_n_proz "Poetul în proză"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 14/2000&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Cugetările'' addendum, Simion believes, explains that ''Poor Dionis'' should not be read as a passive and contemplative scenario: "The image of the world as the insipid dream of a tomcat seems a daring minimization of philosophical concepts, curiously so in a spirit such as Eminescu's, that is so very attracted to speculative matters. However, once we hold everything up to the poet's polemical intent, his parody of meditation and mockery of cosmogonic representations reveal their true significance."&lt;ref&gt;Simion, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

As a lamentation of the poet's marginality in modern society, the poetry fragment is, according to writer and academic [[Mihai Zamfir]], merely a "Romantic cliché".&lt;ref name="mz2secole"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihai Zamfir]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/un_eminescu_ntre_dou_secole "Un Eminescu între două secole"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 34/2000&lt;/ref&gt; In his depiction of Dionis' lodging, particularly so for ''Cugetările'', Eminescu may have been inspired by prints made after [[Carl Spitzweg]]'s canvass, ''The Poor Painter''. Historian of ideas Ana-Stanca Tăbărași suggests that Spitzweg's declining [[Biedermeier]] atmosphere was localized by Eminescu, treated with ironic detachment, and completed by intertextual allusions to another German motif: ''[[Komm, süßer Tod, komm selge Ruh|Komm, süßer Tod]]'', for ''Cugetările''{{'}}s conclusive "come, oh, sleep or come, oh death".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ana-Stanca Tăbărași, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/eminescu_-_spitzweg "Eminescu – Spitzweg. O posibilă sursă de inspirație pentru ''Cugetările sărmanului Dionis''"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 32/2000&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar [[Virgil Nemoianu]] also sees the story as quintessentially "Biedermeier", wrapped up in "tamed" or "high" Romanticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Dan Croitoru, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/printre_clasici "Printre clasici"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 19/1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Various commentators have revised the casual readings of the story as a late-Romantic joke, while also rejecting its interpretation in purely philosophical terms. According to scholar Ilina Gregori, the realistic and dream-like levels of ''Poor Dionis'' should never be separated. According to Gregori, the work as a whole is an "[[Wiktionary:oneiric|oneiric]] manifesto", an attack on the very conventions of [[literary realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Daniela Petroșel, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160305013608/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/PETROSELmar9.html "Umbra lui Eminescu la Berlin"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, writer Eugen Cadaru proposes that ''Poor Dionis'' is a Romanian contribution to [[magic realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Eugen Cadaru, [http://www.revistaluceafarul.ro/index.html?id=5123&amp;editie=195 "Realismul magic românesc în contextul realismului magic european"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 11/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

''Poor Dionis'' is central to another debate, which focuses on Eminescu's status as a late Romantic, versus his possibly role as a forerunner of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Eminescu's story was lauded by poet and critic [[Benjamin Fondane]], a prominent figure in [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romania's own Symbolist circle]] (ca. 1915). Fondane regarded ''Poor Dionis'' as an actual Symbolist masterpiece, his terminology also listing Novalis among the Symbolists.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ana-Maria Tomescu, [http://www.uab.ro/reviste_recunoscute/index.php?cale=2005 "Tradiționalism, modernitate sau avangardă în poezia lui Barbu Fundoianu?"], in ''Philologica Yearbook'', Vol. 3, 2005, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; The same notion was entertained by [[N. Davidescu]], the Symbolist propagandist, who in 1939 described Eminescu as Romania's first Symbolist.&lt;ref&gt;Marian, pp. 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; Davidescu's claim was rejected by Lovinescu, who insisted that Eminescu and ''Poor Dionis'' only appeared Symbolist because of a substantial debt to Kantianism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugen Lovinescu]], ''Istoria literaturii române contemporane'', p. 43. Chișinău: [[Editura Litera]], 1998. {{ISBN|9975740502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Symbolist connection was revisited in 2008 by researcher Rodica Marian, who sees ''Poor Dionis'' as compatible with ''[[Bruges-la-Morte]]'', by [[Georges Rodenbach]]. She identifies both works as [[prose poem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Marian, pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memoir and political statement===
In various critical interpretations of the novella, special note is made about the possibility that Dionis is the writer's ''[[alter ego]]''. The story never reveals whether Dionis or Dan is the actual protagonist—according to Pârvulescu, the solution is "so very simple that everyone misses it by a long shot: the 'real' hero of these episodes is the poet, no matter what pseudonym he uses, and his dream [...] is the poem".&lt;ref name="ippoetul"/&gt; Early on, Eminescu admirers were especially prone to arriving at this conclusion. Eminescian poet [[Alexandru Vlahuță]] notes that he imagined Eminescu to be a sort of sleepwalking Dionis, and that, to his surprise, his idol was rather "a stout and round-faced, aging, man, short-haired and dressed like any other".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/cum_se_mpac_literaii_cu_muzicienii "Cum se împacă literații cu muzicienii"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 15/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the early reviewers, G. D. Pencioiu took a radical [[Social determinism|socially deterministic]] stand, proposing that ''Poor Dionis'' and its Schopenhauerian content were the product of frustration with,  and withdrawal from, "[[bourgeois society]]".&lt;ref&gt;Dimitrie A. Teodoru, "Dl Pencioiŭ și ''Sermanul Dionis''", in ''[[Contemporanul]]'', Nr. 7/1890, pp. 92–96&lt;/ref&gt; To some degree, the notion resurfaces in other biographically-inclined scholars. Iorga believed that the work was not only generically autobiographical, but also an actual record of Eminescu's various cultural immersions, including his destitute career as a [[Prompter (theatre)|prompter]] in Bucharest and [[Giurgiu]], and his enduring affection for Iași.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Resisting the posthumous glorification of Eminescu, Lovinescu also suggests that, like his protagonist, Eminescu lived his final decades in abject squalor.&lt;ref name="ipcelpsihana5"/&gt; More generally, Sanielevici described ''Poor Dionis'' as a record of youth, "with its illusions, its sweet sorrow, its mirage of love eternal and fairy-tale life"; "readers will feel [...] like they co-wrote [it]".&lt;ref&gt;Botez, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing that Eminescu died as a mental ward patient, some have argued that the travel episodes are records of a developing [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="ipcelpsihana5"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ioan Pop-Curșeu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20100524131138/http://www.revisteaua.ro/core/numere/2009/Steaua%206%202009.pdf "Eugen Lovinescu: lecturi eminesciene. Însemnări de psihanaliză... textuală"], in ''Steaua'', Nr. 6/2009, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Much discussion surrounds the topography of Eminescu's apocalyptic landscape. G. Călinescu makes a special mention of the fact that, although he follows the Romantic cult of ruins and decrepitude, Eminescu does not use its conventions to deplore decadence: "Quite the contrary, Eminescu rejoices."&lt;ref&gt;G. Călinescu, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The episode where Dionis-Dan reshapes his universe also strikes a personal note: Dumitrescu-Bușulenga sees here a "last echo" of Eminescu's youthful belief in his own creative powers, crowning his idealization of the Romantic artist as a [[Lucifer]]ic monster.&lt;ref&gt;Dumitrescu-Bușulenga, pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt; The same characteristic is noted by Ioana Em. Popescu, according to whom Dionis is the expression of immeasurable ambition, a "[[Catilina]]ry" figure.&lt;ref name="arpreatanara15"/&gt; As read by [[Pompiliu Constantinescu]], Eminescu is primarily dominated by his ''[[Eros (concept)|Eros]]'', and in ''Poor Dionis'' he depicts himself as the erotic ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimon]]''. The story's tragic note, he concludes, is in the ''daimon''{{'}}s subordination to the [[demiurge]]: [[unrequited love]], followed by withdrawal into creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, pp. 130–133, 141–145&lt;/ref&gt; In his own essay on Eminescu's sexuality, I. P. Culianu postulates that "''Poor Dionis'' overflows with self-confessions, aspirations and romanesque ideals": Dionis' unrequited love is the author's own "[[Voyeurism|voyeur]]" self, idealizing his transformation into a "desirable suitor".&lt;ref name="ipcemineros"/&gt;

To some degree, this transfiguration also appears in Eminescu's treatment of other settings and landscapes. The Bucharest of Eminescu's imagination is not just affected by magic, but also suffering from "topographic incoherence" (an expression used by Eminescu expert Ioana Both).&lt;ref name="ibelegie156"&gt;Ioana Both, "Elégie pour une ville absurde: Bucarest", in Thomas Hunkeler, Edith Anna Kunz (eds.), ''Metropolen der Avantgarde/Métropoles des avant-gardes'', p. 156. Bern: [[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang]], 2011. {{ISBN|978-3-0343-0347-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Ruben's presence in early medieval Moldavia, where he is employed by a not-yet-existing [[Socola Monastery|Socola Academy]], is highlighted by Simion as "an evident anachronism".&lt;ref&gt;Simion, p.231&lt;/ref&gt; In his hostile account, George Panu highlights the issues posed by Eminescu's belief in pristine simplicity: "Searching for that old Romanian type, Eminescu had taken his hero, ''Poor Dionis'', down to the age of Alexander the Good, and wishing to confront us with old homes, wide verandas and ancient customs, he resorted to inventing them."&lt;ref&gt;"George Panu", in ''Biblioteca Bucureștilor'', Nr. 1/2000, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Such [[Uchronia|uchronic]] indifference has political implications: at the core, ''Poor Dionis'' is one of several texts by Eminescu where [[medievalism]] takes the center stage, highlighting his conservative vision of history. Panu's view was embraced and nuanced by later exegetes. Historian Alex Drace-Francis notes that Eminescu's work follows the trend of [[Romanian nationalism]], mystifying the historical past and [[Invented tradition|"inventing" tradition]]: "The novella [...] was just one of the forms in which Eminescu displayed his ability to weld the magical logic of the traditional fairy tale with a remarkably modern historical logic of national destiny [...]. Such fictions were a substantive advance in the imagining of continuity, placed on a new psychological plane."&lt;ref&gt;Drace-Francis, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Mihai Cimpoi]] also notes that: "In Eminescu's [[Palingenesis|palingenetic]] vision [...] the Middle Ages are a [[Golden Age|golden age]], the object of all idealized projections."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihai Cimpoi]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20160305025511/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/CIMPOIiul3.html " 'Evul miez' eminescian (II)"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

A political focus is apparent in Eminescu's treatment of the Jewish character, who is a familiar outsider in both the medieval and modern settings. Cultural anthropologist [[Andrei Oișteanu]] proposes that, on its own, Ruben the Jew may embody a positive stereotype, that of the "wise rabbi", which has some deep roots in Romanian folklore.&lt;ref&gt;Oișteanu, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; The oblique references to Ruben's [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] background and his refusal to convert may show that Eminescu regarded the [[Alhambra Decree|1492 Expulsion]] as a collective tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Pavlicencu, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was cited by scholar Petru Zugun as evidence that Eminescu was not a xenophobe, as has been argued by other historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Petru Zugun, [https://web.archive.org/web/20160305014805/http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/ZUGUNian12.htm "M. Eminescu—'Poetul național', nu scriitor xenofob, antisemit și rasist. Argumentare lingvistică și stilistică"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, however, Eminescu had an ambiguous attitude toward the Jews, veering between entirely positive characterizations and antisemitic outbursts.&lt;ref&gt;Oișteanu, pp. 10, 18, 26, 51–52, 55, 71, 98, 181, 199, 209, 257–261&lt;/ref&gt; Ioana Both sees a connection between the apocalyptic nightmare of a city haunted by demons, on one hand, and, on the other, Eminescu's political articles, which proclaim that Romania was being invaded by foreigners.&lt;ref name="ibelegie156"/&gt;

Even before being recovered by the Symbolists, ''Poor Dionis'' was emulated by [[Ioan Slavici]]. Later in the 1870s, Slavici intended to write a spin-off, one based on [[Platonism]] rather than German ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, one year after its author had died, ''Poor Dionis'' was featured in an Eminescu anthology compiled by [[Vasile Morțun]], and reappeared in the 1914 ''Complete Works'', put out by [[A. C. Cuza]].&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 360, 366–367&lt;/ref&gt; It was only during that interval that the first critical commentary, penned by [[Nicolae Iorga]], appeared in [[George Panu]]'s ''[[Lupta]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Marian, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; in 1906, Panu also contributed notes which restated his criticism of the work as "insane", but also included some words of praise.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 168–169, 470–471&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Fondane and Davidescu, other Romanian Symbolists were enthusiastic about Eminescu's creation. They include the poet Gheorghe Orleanu (1873–1908), who, together with [[Eugeniu Botez]] and Constantin Calmuski, rewrote the story into a five-act Symbolist play. It was performed only once, in June 1909, for the Eminescu festival in [[Galați]], and is mainly noted for merging poems by Eminescu and [[Veronica Micle]] into the dramatic format.&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Mohanu, ''Jean Bart (Eugeniu Botez).

Overall, ''Poor Dionis'' and all other prose works by Eminescu were only marginally relevant to students of Eminescu, well into the interwar period.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 148–149, 450&lt;/ref&gt; By then, however, the story had drawn attention from the Carlo Tagliavini, who published commentary on it for an Italian reading public (1923).&lt;ref&gt;Copcea, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of [[modernist literature]], and its growth into Romanian ''[[Trăirism]]'' (a cultivation of the immediate experience), generalized interest in Eminescu's fantasy prose. Although the work had been censured by their mentor, [[Nae Ionescu]], ''Trăirists'' revived the Dionisian misunderstood hero; early study cases include [[Constantin Fântâneru]]'s ''Interior'' (1932).&lt;ref&gt;Gabriela Glăvan, "Constantin Fântâneru, ''Interior''.

Albany: [[State University of New York Press]], 2010.  {{ISBN|978-1-4384-2958-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same interval, the [[Cinema of Romania|Romanian film industry]], supervised by state-appointed managers [[Nichifor Crainic]] and [[Ion Filotti Cantacuzino]], turned its attention to Eminescu's novella.&lt;ref name="cst12–13"&gt;Călin Stănculescu, ''Cartea și filmul'', pp. 12–13. Bucharest: Editura Biblioteca Bucureștilor &amp; Union of Romanian Filmmakers, 2001.  {{ISBN|978-606-8337-27-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poet [[Dan Botta]] took it upon himself to write a ''Poor Dionis'' screenplay, which saw print in ''[[Familia (magazine)|Familia]]'' and received good reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[[Petru Comarnescu]], "Note.

Under the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]], ''Poor Dionis'' and ''Cugetările'' were standards of the [[Education in Romania|state curriculum]], with the accent falling on the plight of misunderstood geniuses living in squalor. As Mihai Zamfir notes, this approach tended to favor "fragments of rough drafts" over the published version.&lt;ref name="mz2secole"/&gt; In 1969, actor [[Emil Botta]] (brother of the poet-screenwriter) recorded his rendition of ''Cugetările'', re-released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Amalia Lumei, [http://www.revista-apostrof.ro/articole.php?id=1854 "Emil Botta … de la Dante la Eminescu"], in ''[[Apostrof]]'', Nr. 7/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Before the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|fall of communism]], ''Poor Dionis'' was also being recovered by Romania's late-modernist (''[[Optzeciști]]'') authors, who revived fantasy prose, and then by the [[Postmodern literature|postmodernists]].

Under post-communism, Eminescu's story remained outside the national curriculum, although ''Cugetările'' was included as optional reading material in some high-school textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Marcela Ciortea, [http://www.timpul.ro/magazines/108.pdf "Teorie și practică în educație"], in ''[[Timpul]]'', Nr. 153, December 2011, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the opening work in [[Șerban Foarță]]'s anthology of "feline poetry", published 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Marcela Ciortea, [http://www.timpul.ro/ro-numar-pdf-martie-2011-100.html "Tratat și -logíe (un element de compunere savantă)"], in ''[[Timpul]]'', Nr. 145, March 2011, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; while the whole story was again rearranged into a short play by [[Cătălina Buzoianu]] (before 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Ana Hațiegan, [http://www.revista22.ro/bucurestiul-cultural-nr22006-2466.html "Apele memoriei"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 832, February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Eminescu's discourse about relativity, like its possible kinship with the [[theory of relativity]], have since continued to stimulate Romanian critics and scientists. Writing in 2006, mathematician and essayist [[Solomon Marcus]] suggested that "such mentions have usually been compromised by exaggerations that would turn the poet into a precursor (if not indeed a coauthor) of the theory of relativity. Thankfully, more serious approaches have since followed".&lt;ref name="smeinstein"/&gt;

In 1904, ''[[Bukarester Tagblatt]]'' published a translation of ''Poor Dionis'' into German, penned by W. Majerczik and [[Henric Sanielevici]].&lt;ref&gt;N. N. Muntean, "Bibliografia literară română în streinătate", in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 7/1944, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed ten years later by M.

Eminescu în nemțește", in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 4/1904, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Even after discarding Symbolism for [[Jewish existentialism]], Fondane was an avid reader of ''Poor Dionis''. By 1929, he had taken the initiative of translating the story into his adoptive French, without ever managing to finish that work.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Daniel, "Destinul unui poet", in [[Benjamin Fondane|B.

Sankara came to power in what was then the [[Republic of Upper Volta]] in a popularly-supported 1983 military coup, and ruled until his assassination in a coup led by [[Blaise Compaoré]] in 1987.

There is a strong political dissonance between the movements which ascribe to Sankara's political legacy and ideals, a fact which the Burkinabé opposition politician [[Bénéwendé Stanislas Sankara]] – no relation – described in 2001 as being "due to a lack of definition of the concept."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Opposition leader advocates "Sankarism |url=http://www.panapress.com/Opposition-leader-advocates--Sankarism---13-448819-17-lang2-index.html|newspaper=[[PanaPress]]|location=[[Dakar]]|date=5 November 2000 |accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sankarists range from [[Communism|communists]] and more moderate [[Socialism|socialists]] to [[democratic socialism]] and [[Populism|populists]].

==History==
During his time in power, Sankara – a well-known war veteran noted for his charisma – attempted to bring about what he called the "Democratic and Popular Revolution" ({{lang-fr|Révolution démocratique et populaire}}), a radical transformation of society. A number of organizations were formed to implement this revolution, among them the [[Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (Burkina Faso)|Committees for the Defense of the Revolution]], the [[Popular Revolutionary Tribunal (Burkina Faso)|Popular Revolutionary Tribunals]] and the [[Pioneers of the Revolution]]. A vast number of reforms were enacted in the newly renamed Burkina Faso between 1983 and 1987, most of which were undone after the military coup which ousted and killed Sankara. Prior to his death, the Burkinabé government faced significant allegations of human rights abuses from [[Amnesty International]] and other international organizations, including extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detentions and torture of political opponents.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Even after the death of Thomas Sankara his legacy lived on, much due to his charismatic personal image. Sometimes dubbed the "[[Che Guevara]] of Africa" due to his similarities in style to the [[Argentina|Argentinian]] revolutionary and the inspiration he took from the [[Cuban Revolution]], Sankara became known for his frugal living, motorcycle riding, guitar playing, and opposition to the [[cult of personality]], all personal traits which set him aside from contemporary African statesmen. For example, when asked why he didn't want his portrait hung in public places, as was the norm for other leaders on the continent, he replied "There are seven million Thomas Sankaras." Ideologically, Sankara was a [[Pan-Africanism|pan-Africanist]] and [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] who sought to reclaim the African identity of his nation and opposed [[neocolonialism]], and a communist who studied the works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sankara |first=Thomas |date=2007 |title=Thomas Sankara Speaks: the Burkina Faso Revolution: 1983-1987|editor-last=Prairie|editor-first=Michel|location=[[United States]]|publisher=Pathf|pages=20–21 |accessdate=5 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first groups to connect ideologically with the label of "Sankarism" was the Sankarist Movement, formed in exile in [[Paris]] only weeks after Sankara's assassination on 15 October 1987.&lt;ref name="Retreat"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes|first=Arnold|date=1992 |title=Marxism's Retreat from Africa |location=[[London]]|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis|Psychology Press]]|page=100|isbn=071-464-502-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, self-identified Sankarist political parties and other organizations have been a common feature within the Burkinabé opposition movement against the government of President Compaoré. Many Sankarist leaders have a past in either Sankara's government or in the organizations he created. For example, Ernest Nongma Ouédraogo – leader of the [[Sankarist Pan-African Convention]] –  was Minister of Security under Sankara, and [[Sams’K Le Jah]] – leader of the [[Le Balai Citoyen|Citizens' Broom]] ({{lang-fr|Le Balai Citoyen}}) – received his political education as a teenager in the Pioneer movement.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |last=Duval Smith|first=Alex |date=30 April 2014|title='Africa's Che Guevara': Thomas Sankara's legacy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27219307|newspaper=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |location=[[London]] |accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sankarists have been prominent in both the [[2011 Burkinabé protests]] and the [[2014 Burkinabé uprising]]. The latter successfully overthrew President Blaise Compaoré in late October 2014, forcing the leader to resign and flee the country to the [[Ivory Coast]] and causing a military takeover. Thomas Sankara has been cited as a major inspiration for the protesters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kobo|first=Kingsley|date=31 October 2014|title=

The [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] (EFF) is a [[Black nationalist]], far-left political party in [[South Africa]], founded in 2013 by [[Julius Malema]], the controversial former President of the [[African National Congress Youth League]]. The party is currently the third-largest party in both houses of the [[Parliament of South Africa|South African parliament]], receiving 1,169,259 votes and a 6.35% share of the vote in the [[South African general election, 2014|2014 general election]]. The EFF claims to take significant inspiration from Sankara in terms of both style and ideology.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; In a May 2014 column, the prominent EFF member Jackie Shandu declared his party a "proudly Sankarist formation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shandu|first=Jackie|date=22 May 2014|title=The Sankarist makings of the EFF|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2014-05-22-the-sankarist-makings-of-eff/#.VFqe0d186rX|newspaper=[[Daily Maverick]]|location=[[Johannesburg]]|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expelled from that party, Andile Mngxitama founded [[Black First Land First]] in 2015, with [[Black Consciousness Movement|black consciousness]] and [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]] policies and a Sankarist leadership ethos.&lt;ref name="n24_launch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Black-First-Land-First-A-revolutionary-Call-20150813 | title=Black First! – Land First!

'''Scottish Common Sense Realism''', also known as the '''Scottish School of Common Sense''',&lt;ref name="Boas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boas|first=George|title=Dominant themes of modern philosophy: a history|publisher=Ronald Press Co|location=New York|year=1957|pages=660|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-AYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Scottish+School+of+Common+Sense%22&amp;dq=%22Scottish+School+of+Common+Sense%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] school of [[philosophy]] that originated in the ideas of Scottish philosophers [[Thomas Reid]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[James Beattie (poet)|James Beattie]], and [[Dugald Stewart]] during the 18th-century [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. Reid emphasized man's innate ability to perceive common ideas and that this process is inherent in and interdependent with judgement. Common sense therefore, is the foundation of philosophical inquiry. Though best remembered for its opposition to the pervasive philosophy of [[David Hume]], Scottish Common Sense philosophy is influential and evident in the works of [[Thomas Jefferson]] and late 18th-century American politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Towsey|first=Mark|title='Philosophically Playing the Devil' recovering readers' responses to David Hume and the Scottish Enlightenment|journal=Historical Research|date=May 2010|volume=23|issue=220|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2281.2009.00503.x|pages=301–320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Lucille M.|title=Uncovering the Significance of the Animal Imagery in Modern Chivalry: An Application of Common Sense Realism|journal=Early American Literature|date=December 1, 1979/80|volume=14|issue=3|pages=308–309|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a56bf090-21e9-4d55-8576-9b02e851b927%40sessionmgr115&amp;vid=3&amp;hid=124|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Painting of David Hume.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Hume]]]]
The Scottish School of Common Sense was an [[epistemological]] philosophy that flourished in Scotland in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref name=Redekop&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redekop | first1 = Benjamin | year = 2004 | title = The Correspondence of Thomas Reid | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of History | volume = 39 | issue = 1| page = 212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots can be found in responses to the writings of such philosophers as [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]], and its most prominent members were [[Dugald Stewart]], [[Thomas Reid]] and [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]. Philosophically, Scottish Realism served as a rebuttal to scepticism while keeping with the influential teachings of [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref name=Redekop /&gt; While largely understated for many years,&lt;ref name=Redekop /&gt; the influence it had on philosophers elsewhere in Europe, not to mention in the United States, is of a considerable magnitude.

One central concern of the school was to defend "common sense" against philosophical [[paradox]] and [[scepticism]]. It argued that common-sense beliefs govern the lives and thoughts even of those who avow non-commonsensical beliefs and that matters of common sense are inherent to the acquisition of knowledge. The qualities of its works were not generally consistent; [[Edward S. Reed]] writes, e.g., "[Whereas] Thomas Reid wished to use common sense to develop philosophical wisdom, much of this school simply wanted to use common sense to attack any form of intellectual change."&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Reed, The Necessity of Experience, p. 16. Yale University Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
The Scottish School of Common Sense was founded by Reid in opposition to [[Descartes]]'s  [[Idealism|Theory of Ideas]].&lt;ref name=Reid&gt;Reid, Thomas (1997). An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press LTD. pp. xii-xxiii. {{ISBN|0748607226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; But the epistemology of [[empirical evidence|sense experience]] led [[John Locke]] and David Hume to a skeptical philosophy that realists found absurd and contrary to common experience. Thus Hume and his sceptical argument would serve as the primary foil to the development of Reid's philosophy. Under the tutelage of [[George Turnbull (theologian)|George Turnbull]], Reid embraced the tenets of Providential Naturalism and its four interconnected tenets; using these as the basis for his refutation of the theory of ideas.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt; Reid painstakingly developed his treatise ''An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense'' over the course of 40 years, often seeking the input of his contemporary philosophers within the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] including Hume.&lt;ref name=Reid /&gt;

Reid articulated the basic principle of Common Sense Realism:

:"If there are certain principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity to take for granted in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd."&lt;ref&gt;Cuneo and Woudenberg, eds. ''The Cambridge Companion to Thomas Reid'' (2004) p 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish Common Sense Realism is rooted in Aristotelian thought and advocates an empirical and scientific philosophy wherein trust of our senses is implicit and necessary.&lt;ref name=Haldan&gt;Haldane, John (2007 April). "Scottish Philosophy". Monism 90 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|148}} The principles of common sense are fundamental to our accumulation of knowledge of both [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and physical constructs.&lt;ref name="Redekop" /&gt; However, observation alone cannot account for all knowledge and truth can be garnered by reflection.&lt;ref name=Haldan /&gt;{{rp|149}} In Reid's own words:

:"I can likewise conceive an individual object that really exists, such as [[St. Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's Church]] in London. I have an idea of it; I conceive it. The immediate object of this conception is 400 miles distant; and I have no reason to think it acts upon me or that I act on it."&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Thomas. [https://archive.org/stream/essaysonintellec02reiduoft#page/n7/mode/2up Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man]. Dublin: Ireland. Essay IV  p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

The school taught that every person had ordinary experiences that provided intuitively certain assurance of a) the existence of the self, b) the existence of real objects that could be seen and felt; and c) certain "first principles" upon which sound morality and religious beliefs could be established. These principles laid the foundation for Reid's influential theory of perception.

In practice, philosophers of the Scottish school offered scientific explanations to historical events and advocated an unprejudiced and inter-disciplinary approach to education, free from religious and patriotic biases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mirayes|first=J. Rubén Valdés|title=The Prejudices of Education: Educational Aspects of the Scottish Enlightenment|journal=Atlantis|year=2005|volume=27|issue=2|page=101|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=5217a8a1-eb47-4963-a2f9-2f3fa8f0e59c%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=8&amp;hid=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plassart|first=Anna|title="Scientific Whigs"?

===Theories of perception===
Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart offered related theories of perception rooted in Scottish Common Sense Realism. According to [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] of [[Yale University]], Reid's philosophy can be non-contentiously reduced to four basic precepts:
:"(1) The objects of acts of perception are external objects-That is, mind-independent spatially-located entities;
: (2) The necessary and sufficient condition for perceiving an external object is that the object cause in one a conception thereof and an immediate (non-inferential) belief about it;
: (3) We human beings are so made that, in perception, the external object causes a conception of, and an immediate belief about, itself, by way of causing a sensation which in turn causes ('suggests') the conception and immediate belief;
: (4) The sensation may cause, and often does in fact cause, the conception and belief without one's being sufficiently attentive to the sensation for a belief about it to be formed in one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolterstorff|first=Nicholas|title=What Sort of Epistemological Realist was Thomas Reid?|journal=Journal of Scottish Philosophy|date=Autumn 2006|volume=4|issue=2|pages=111–112|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=9199cefe-9180-47a6-9e3d-6c43223696fa%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=13&amp;hid=123&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a9h&amp;AN=23131624|doi=10.3366/jsp.2006.4.2.111}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dugald Stewart's theory of perception acknowledges a great influence from Reid whose philosophy he termed "fundamental laws of belief.".&lt;ref name=Dabney&gt;Townsend, Dabney (April 2007). [http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=5217a8a1-eb47-4963-a2f9-2f3fa8f0e59c%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=12&amp;hid=123 "Dugald Stewart on Beauty and Taste"] Monist 90 (2 p. 272)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stewart proffered a more moderate approach to realism and his theory of perception emphasized the utility of the senses.&lt;ref name=Dabney /&gt;

==Influence==
Common Sense Realism not only dominated Scottish thought in the 19th century, it had a major influence as well in France, the United States, and other countries. [[Victor Cousin]] (1792–1867) was the most important proponent in France. Reidian thought was the "orthodox philosophy of colleges and universities"&lt;ref name=redekop&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redekop | first1 = Benjamin | year = 2004 | title = The Correspondence of Thomas Reid | url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=9199cefe-9180-47a6-9e3d-6c43223696fa%40sessionmgr114&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=123 | journal = Canadian Journal of History | volume = 39 | issue = 1| page = 212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the early 18th century and provided an intellectual bedrock for the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Redekop" /&gt; 

===The Founding Fathers===
[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'', a painting by [[John Trumbull]] depicting the [[Committee of Five]] presenting their draft of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] to the Congress on 28 June 1776. Trumbull's painting appears on the reverse of the [[United States two-dollar bill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrevolution.org/deckey.html americanrevolution.org] – Key to Trumbull's picture&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Common Sense Realism swept American intellectual circles in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;Robinson, Daniel (April 2007). "The Scottish Enlightenment and the American Founding". Monist 90 (2)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181}} Reid's philosophy was pervasive during the [[American Revolution]] and served as a stabilizing philosophical influence.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|180}}  Hailed by some as the "father of modern psychiatry,"&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|173}} [[Benjamin Rush]]'s tutelage at the [[University of Edinburgh]] imbued him with strong realist tendencies which influenced much of his scientific and political work including his moral opposition to slavery.&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|174}}  Evidence of the influence of Scottish Common Sense realism can readily be found in the philosophy of both [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]]. Adams compared the contributions of Dugald Stewart favorably to works of [[Aristotle]] and [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|170}} Scotsman and signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], [[John Witherspoon]] presided over [[Princeton University]]; students under his tutelage included 12 state governors, 55 delegates to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] and future president [[James Madison]].&lt;ref name=Robinson /&gt;{{rp|171}} His education at the University of Edinburgh made him a strong proponent of the Scottish Enlightenment and Realism. [[James McCosh]] (1811–94) continued the influence of Scottish Realism at Princeton when he became president of the university in 1868, reviving its influence as a major stronghold of the movement. [[Noah Porter]] (1811–92) taught Common Sense realism to generations of students at Yale.

===Fundamentalism===
[[File:Princeton Theological Seminary.jpg|thumb|right|Princeton Seminary in the 1800s]]
Scottish Realism greatly influenced conservative religious thought and was strongest at [[Princeton Seminary]] until the Seminary moved in new directions after 1929. The Princeton theologians built their elaborate system on the basis of "common-sense" realism, biblicism and confessionalism.&lt;ref&gt;James C. Livingston and Francis Schüssler Fiorenza, ''Modern Christian Thought: The Enlightenment and the nineteenth century'' (2006) p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; James McCosh was brought from Queen's College, Belfast, to Princeton College's Chair of Moral Philosophy and Presidency because of his book "The Method of Divine Government," a Christian philosophy that was precursory to Charles Darwin's "The Origin of Species" (1859). The [[Princeton Theologians]] followed McCosh to adopt a stance of theistic evolution. They tried to persuade [[John Gresham Machen]] (1881–1937), a leader of [[Fundamentalist Christianity|the Fundamentalists]] in the 1920s, but he would not stand with McCosh, nor could he stand for the shift the school was making. Therefore, he and a number of other Princeton faculty members left and started [[Westminster Theological Seminary]] in Philadelphia. This, however, did not stop McCosh from moving forward. It was his goal to develop Princeton as a Christian university in North America, as well as a forefront intellectual seminary of the Presbyterian Church.  The faculty of the College and Seminary included both evolutionary thinkers and non-evolutionary thinkers. Much evangelical theology of the 21st century is based on Princeton theology and thus reflects Common Sense Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley J. Grenz, Brian McLaren, John R. Franke, ''Renewing the center: evangelical theology in a post-theological era'' (2006) pp 79, 177&lt;/ref&gt; New Testament scholar Grant Osborne concludes that Scottish Common Sense Realism influenced biblical hermeneutics, that the surface level understanding of Scripture became popular, and individualistic interpretations abounded.&lt;ref&gt;Grant R. Osborne, The Hermeneutical Spiral: A Comprehensive Introduction to Biblical Interpretation, Rev. and expanded, 2nd ed. (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2006), 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simon of Tournai''' (c. 1130–1201) was a professor at the [[University of Paris]] in the late twelfth century.  His date of birth is uncertain, but he was teaching before 1184, as he signed a document at the same time as [[Gerard de Pucelle]], the [[Bishop of Coventry]], who died that year.

Simon taught philosophy for ten years, and was said to be brilliant.  Then he moved on to teaching theology, with equal success. He used the writings of [[Aristotle]], whose works were becoming known, and other philosophical works. This eventually brought suspicion upon him from the enemies of the new philosophy. All of his surviving works show an orthodox Catholicism.

'''[[Slavic Native Faith]]''' (Rodnovery) has a [[theology]] that is generally [[monism|monistic]], consisting in the vision of an [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]], supreme [[God]] (''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]'') who begets the universe and ''lives'' as the universe ([[pantheism]] and [[panentheism]]), present in all its phenomena. [[Polytheism]], that is the worship of the gods or spirits, and ancestors, the facets of the supreme Rod generating all phenomena, is an integral part of Rodnovers' beliefs and practices.

The ''[[swastika]]''-like ''kolovrat'' is the symbol of Rodnovery.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=282}} According to the studies of [[Boris Rybakov]], whirl and wheel symbols, which also include patterns like the "six-petaled rose inside a circle" (e.g. [[File:RozetaSolarSymbol.svg|30px]]) and the "thunder mark" (''gromovoi znak''), represent the supreme Rod and its various manifestations (whether [[Triglav]], [[Svetovid]], [[Perun]] or other gods).{{sfn|Ivanits|1989|pp=14, 17}}

===Monism and polytheism: Rod and deities===
{{Further|Rod (Slavic religion)|Deities of Slavic religion}}
Prior to their Christianisation, the Slavic peoples were [[polytheism|polytheists]], worshipping multiple deities who were regarded as the emanations of a supreme [[God]]. According to [[Helmold]]'s ''[[Chronica Slavorum]]'' (compiled 1168–1169), "obeying the duties assigned to them, [the deities] have sprung from his [the supreme God's] blood and enjoy distinction in proportion to their nearness to the god of the gods".{{sfn|Rudy|1985|p=5}} Belief in these deities varied according to location and through time, and it was common for the Slavs to adopt deities from neighbouring cultures.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=89}} Both in Russia and in Ukraine, modern Rodnovers are divided among those who are [[monotheism|monotheists]] and those who are polytheists;{{sfnm|1a1=Lesiv|1y=2013|1p=90|2a1=Aitamurto|2y=2016|2p=65|3a1=Shnirelman|3y=2017|3p=90}} in other words, some emphasise a unitary principle of divinity, while others put emphasis on the distinct gods and goddesses.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} Some Rodnovers even describe themselves as [[atheism|atheists]],{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=102}} believing that gods are not real entities but rather ideal symbols.{{sfn|Shizhenskii|Aitamurto|2017|p=109}}

[[File:The Seven Gods -- Maxim Sukharev.jpg|thumb|left|''The Seven Gods''—Russian artist Maxim Sukharev, 2010s. The artwork represents the supreme God (Rod) manifested as a sevenfold hierarchy, according to Slavic theo-cosmology.{{refn|group=note|''The Seven Gods'', by Russian Rodnover artist Maxim Sukharev, represents the seven major deities of Slavic theo-cosmology, together constituting the hierarchy emanating from the supreme God (Rod). The elements of the drawing are the following ones:&lt;br&gt;

① The [[axis mundi|central axis]] is Svarog ("Heaven"), comprising his three forms: the four-faced Svetovid ("Worldseer"), Perun ("Thunder") at the very centre, and Svarozhich ("Son of Heaven") below. Further below Svarozhich there is another form of he himself contained in a squared receptacle, Ognebog ("Fire God").&lt;br&gt;

② On the right and left hand of Svetovid there are, respectively, Belobog ("White God") and Chernobog ("Black God"), themselves in the guise of Dazhbog ("Day God") and Jutrobog ("Moon God"). They are the supreme polarity upon which all the alternating ways of divine manifestation rely.&lt;br&gt;

③ To the left and to the right of the white figure of Perun, there are, respectively, the black figure of the great goddess Mokosh/Mat Syra Zemlya ("Wetness/Damp Mother Earth") and the red figure of Veles (the male god belonging to the Earth and god of tamed animals).&lt;br&gt;

④ The three forms of Svarog and the three gods Perun, Veles and Mokosh constitute intersecting trinities (Triglav, Tribog), which correspond to the three dimensions: Prav, Yav and Nav. Prav, literally "Right", is ultimately the central axis of Heaven itself, functioning as the medium of all dimensions of space-time. In the guise of thunder (Perun) it impregnates matter (Mokosh), which retains its rhythmic squaring regulations (thus constituting Nav, which is the continuity of time); in the guise of the Son of Heaven it comes to light in present reality (Yav), and is fostered by humanity (Veles), and preserved as the hearth (Ognebog).}}]]

Monotheism and polytheism are not regarded as mutually exclusive. The shared underpinning is a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] view that is [[holism|holistic]] in its understanding of the universe.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=102}} Similarly to the ancient Slavic religion, a common theological stance among Rodnovers is that of [[monism]], by which the many different gods (polytheism) are seen as manifestations of the single, universal God—generally identified by the concept of ''Rod'',{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} also known as ''Sud'' ("Judge") and ''Prabog'' ("Pre-God", "First God") among [[South Slavs]].{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}}

In the Russian and Ukrainian centres of Rodnover theology, the concept of Rod has been emphasised as particularly important.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|Lesiv|2017|p=142}} The root *''rod'' is attested in sources about pre-Christian religion referring to divinity and ancestrality.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=288}} Mathieu-Colas defines Rod as the "primordial God", but the term also literally means the generative power of the family and "kin", "birth", "origin" and "fate" as well.{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} Its negative form, ''urod'', means something wrenched, deformed, degenerated, monstrous.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}} Sometimes, the meaning of the word is left deliberately obscure among Rodnovers, allowing for a variety of different interpretations.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} The Russian [[volkhv]]s [[Veleslav]] (Ilya Cherkasov) and Dobroslav (Aleksei Dobrovolsky) explain Rod as a life force that comes in nature and is "all-pervasive" or "omnipresent".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=65}}

====Manifestationism====
[[File:Slavic divine hierarchy, Creuzer-Mone 1822.jpg|thumb|350px|Hierarchy of the divine, with the two categories proceeding from the supreme God, as illustrated by [[Georg Friedrich Creuzer|Georg F. Creuzer]] and [[Franz Mone|Franz J. Mone]].{{sfn|Creuzer|Mone|1822|p=197}} All deities are manifestations of either Belobog or Chernobog, and in both categories they may be either ''Razi'', rede-givers, or ''Zirnitra'', dragon wizards.{{sfnm|1a1=Creuzer|1a2=Mone|1y=1822|1pp=195–197|2a1=Heck|2y=1852|2pp=289–290}}]]
Cosmologically speaking, Rod is conceived as the spring of universal [[emanationism|emanation]], which articulates in a cosmic hierarchy of gods.{{sfn|Rabotkina|2013|p=240}} When emphasising this monism, Rodnovers may define themselves as ''rodnianin'', "believers in God"{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=269}} (or "in nativity", "in genuinity"). Already the pioneering Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Shaian argued that God manifests as a variety of different deities.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013b|p=130}}

This theological explanation is called "manifestationism" by some contemporary Rodnovers, and implies the idea of a spirit–matter continuum; the different gods, who proceed from the supreme God, generate differing categories of things not as their external creations (as objects), but embodying themselves as these entities. In their view, beings are the progeny of gods; even phenomena such as the thunder are conceived in this way as embodiments of these gods (in this case, [[Perun]]).{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}} In the wake of this theology, it is common among Slavic Native Faith practitioners to say that "we are not God's slaves, but God's sons".{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}} Some Rodnover groups espouse the idea that specific Slavic populations are the sons of peculiar facets of God; for instance, groups who rely upon the tenth-century manuscript ''The Lay of Igor's Host'' may affirm the idea that Russians are the grandchildren of [[Dazhbog]] (the "Giving God", "Day God").{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=188}}

A Russian Rodnover leader, Nikolai Speransky ([[volkhv]] Velimir), emphasises a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] eternal struggle between forces of [[good and evil]]; the former represented by [[Belobog]] ("White God"), who created the human soul, and the latter by [[Chernobog]] ("Black God"), who created the human body.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=93}} They are the twofold dynamism through which the supreme God expresses its spirits, taking part in the characteristics of both categories.{{sfn|Heck|1852|pp=289–290}}

====Clusters of deities====
[[File:Northwestern Slavic divine hierarchy, Hanuš 1842.jpg|thumb|350px|Northwestern Slavic hierarchy of the divine, as illustrated by Ignác Jan Hanuš.{{sfn|Hanuš|1842|p=182}}]]
Pantheons of deities are not unified among practitioners of Slavic Native Faith.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|pp=289–290}} Different Rodnover groups often have a preference for a particular deity over others.{{sfn|Laruelle|2008|p=290}} The Union of Russian Rodnover Communities founded and led by Vadim Kazakov recognises a pantheon of over thirty deities emanated by the supreme Rod;&lt;ref name="Adversus paganos"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Belov |first1=Maxim |last2=Garanov |first2=Yuri |date=10 February 2015 |title=Adversus Paganos |publisher=Journal of the Ascension Cathedral of Astrakhan |website=astrsobor.ru |url=http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523191143/http://astrsobor.ru/adversus-paganos-novaya-istoriya-protiv-yazychnikov/ |archive-date=23 May 2017 |access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; these include attested deities from Slavic pre-Christian and folk traditions, Slavicised Hindu deities (such as ''Vyshen'', i.e. [[Vishnu]], and ''Intra'', i.e. [[Indra]]), Iranian deities (such as [[Simargl]] and Khors), deities from the ''[[Book of Veles]]'' (such as Pchelich), and figures from Slavic folk tales such as the wizard [[Koschei]].{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=95}} Rodnovers also believe and worship [[tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] of specific elements, lands and environments,{{sfn|Aitamurto|2006|p=204}} such as waters, forests and the household. Gods may be subject to functional changes among modern Rodnovers; for instance, the traditional god of livestock and poetry [[Veles (god)|Veles]] is called upon as the god of literature and communication.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}}

===Sylenko's monotheism===
In Ukraine, there has been a debate as to whether the religion should be monotheistic or polytheistic.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=90}} In keeping with the pre-Christian belief systems of the region, the groups who inherit Volodymyr Shaian's tradition, among others, espouse polytheism.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=90}} Conversely, Lev Sylenko's [[Native Ukrainian National Faith]] (RUNVira for short, called "Sylenkoism" in some academic scholarship) regards itself as monotheistic and focuses its worship upon a single God whom they identify by the name Dazhbog.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005c|1p=225|2a1=Lesiv|2y=2013a|2p=90|3a1=Lesiv|3y=2013b|3p=130}} For members of this group, Dazhbog is regarded as the life-giving energy of the cosmos.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}}

Sylenko characterised Dazhbog as "light, endlessness, gravitation, eternity, movement, action, the energy of unconscious and conscious Being".{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Based on this description, Ivakhiv argued that Sylenkoite theology might better be regarded as [[pantheism|pantheistic]] or [[panentheism|panentheistic]] rather than monotheistic.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=225}} Sylenko acknowledged that the ancient Ukrainian-Rus were polytheists but believed that a monotheistic view reflected an evolution in human spiritual development and thus should be adopted.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=91}} A similar view is adopted by Russian [[Ynglism]].{{sfn|Aitamurto|2016|p=66}} Lesiv recorded one RUNVira member who related that "we cannot believe in various forest, field and water spirits today. Yes, our ancestors believed in these things but we should not any longer".{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=92}} For RUNVira members, polytheism is regarded as backward.{{sfn|Lesiv|2013a|p=92}} Some polytheist Rodnovers have regarded the approach adopted by Sylenko's followers as an inauthentic approach to the religion.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005c|p=223}}

==Cosmology==
[[File:Black and White. Suprematist Composition (Malevich, 1915).png|thumb|''Black and White. Suprematist Composition''—[[Kazimir Malevich]], 1915. According to Miroslav Shkandrij, the Russian [[Suprematism|Suprematist]] artist was influenced by a dual cosmology found in various folk beliefs, including Belobog and Chernobog.&lt;ref&gt;Shkandrij, Miroslav. "[http://shron.chtyvo.org.ua/Myroslav_Shkandrij/Reinterpreting_Malevich_Biography_Autobiography_Art_anhl.pdf Reinterpreting Malevich: Biography, Autobiography, Art]". ''Canadian-American Slavic Studies''. '''36''' (4). pp. 405–420. (see p. 415).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Dual dynamism: Belobog and Chernobog===
According to the ''Book of Veles'', and to the doctrine accepted by many Rodnover organisations, the supreme Rod begets ''Prav'' (literally "Right" or "Order"; cf. Greek ''[[Orthotes]]'', Sanskrit ''[[Ṛta]]'') in primordial undeterminacy ([[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]), giving rise to the circular pattern of [[Svarog]] ("Heaven", "Sky"; cf. Sanskrit ''[[Svarga]]''), which constantly multiplies generating new worlds (world-eggs). Prav works by means of a dual dynamism, represented by Belobog ("White God"{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}}) and Chernobog ("Black God"{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}}); they are two aspects of the same, appearing in reality as the forces of waxing and waning, giving rise to polarities like up and down, light and dark, male and female, singular and plural. Man and woman are further symbolised by father Svarog itself and mother [[Lada (goddess)|Lada]].{{sfn|Rabotkina|2013|p=240}}

This supreme polarity is also represented by the relation between Rod and ''Rozanica'', literally the "Generatrix", the mother goddess who expresses herself as the three goddesses who interweave destiny (''Rozanicy'', also known as ''Sudenicy'' among South Slavs, where Rod is also known as Sud, "Judge").{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} She is also known as ''Raziwia'', ''Rodiwa'' or simply ''Dewa'' ("Goddess"), regarded as the singular goddess of whom all lesser goddesses are manifestations.{{sfn|Hanuš|1842|pp=135, 281}} In kinships, while Rod represents the forefathers from the male side, Rozanica represents the ancestresses from the female side. Through the history of the Slavs, the latter gradually became more prominent than the former, because of the importance of the mother to the newborn child.{{sfn|Máchal|1918|p=249}}

===The three qualities of reality and the ''axis mundi''===
====Triglav====
[[File:Triglav scheme.svg|thumb|Scheme of Triglav's cosmology.]]
{{Main|Triglav (mythology)}}
In duality, the supreme Rod's luminous aspect (Belobog) manifests ultimately as threefold, ''Triglav'' ("Three-Headed One"{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}}). The first of the three persons is the aforementioned Svarog ("Heaven"), and the other two are Svarog's further expressions as Perun ("Thunder") and Svetovid (the "Worldseer", itself four-faced). They correspond to the three dimensions of the [[cosmos]], and to the three qualities of soul, flesh and power. Svarog represents Prav itself and soul, Perun represents ''Yav'' and flesh, and Svetovit represents ''Nav'' and spiritual power.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=8, note 35}}

According to Shnirelman, this triune vision and associations were codified by Yuri P. Mirolyubov and further elaborated by Valery Yemelyanov, both interpreters of the ''Book of Veles''.{{sfn|Shnirelman|1998|p=8, note 35}} In olden times, already [[Ebbo]] documented that the Triglav was seen as embodying the connection and mediation between Heaven, Earth and the underworld.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=60}} [[Adam of Bremen]] described the Triglav of [[Wolin (town)|Wolin]] as ''Neptunus triplicis naturae'' (that is to say "[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] of the three natures/generations") attesting the colours that were associated to the three worlds, then further studied by [[Karel Jaromír Erben]]: white for Heaven, green for Earth and black for the underworld.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=63}} Other names of the two manifestations of Svarog are Dazhbog ("Giving God", "Day God") and Svarozhich (the god of fire, literally meaning "Son of Heaven").{{sfn|Mathieu-Colas|2017}} According to the studies of Jiří Dynda, the three faces of Triglav are rather Perun in the heavenly plane (instead of Svarog), Svetovid in the centre from which the horizontal four directions unfold, and Veles in the underworld.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|pp=74–75}} The netherworld, especially in its dark aspect, is indeed traditionally embodied by Veles, who in this function is the god of waters but also the one who guides athwart them in the function of [[psychopomp]] (cf. Sanskrit ''[[Varuna]]'').{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=72}}

In his study of Slavic cosmology, Dynda compares this ''[[axis mundi]]'' concept to similar ones found in other [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] cultures. He gives weight to the Triglav as a representation of what [[Georges Dumézil]] studied as the "Indo-European [[trifunctional hypothesis]]" (holy, martial and economic functions reflected by three human types and social classes).{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=63}} The Triglav also represents the interweaving of the three dimensions of time, metaphorically represented as a three-threaded rope.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=74}} By Ebbo's words, the Triglav is ''summus deus'', the god representing the "sum" of the three dimensions of reality as a mountain or tree (themselves symbols of the ''axis mundi'').{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=64}} In a more abstract theoretical formulation, Dynda says that the three (Triglav) completes the two by springing out as the middle term between the twosome (Belobog and Chernobog), and in turn the threesome implicates the four (Svetovid) as its own middle term of potentiality.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=75}}

====Svetovid====
[[File:Svetovid scheme.svg|thumb|Scheme of Svetovid's cosmology.]]
{{Main|Svetovid}}
Svetovid ("Worldseer", or more accurately "Lord of Power" or "Lord of Holiness", the root *''svet'' defining the "miraculous and beneficial power", or holy power){{sfnm|1a1=Mathieu-Colas|1y=2017|2a1=Rudy|2y=1985|2p=18}} is the four-faced god of war and light, and "the most complete reflection of the Slavic cosmological conception", the union of the four horizontal directions of space with the three vertical tiers of the cosmos (Heaven, Earth and the underworld), and with the three times.{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=75}} [[Helmold]] defined Svetovid as ''deus deorum'' ("god of all gods");{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=59, note 9}} Dynda further defines Svetovid, by [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] words, as a "fourfold (''quaternitas'') potentiality which comes true in threefoldness (''triplicitas'')".{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=75}} His four faces are the masculine Svarog ("Heaven", associated to the north direction and the colour white) and Perun ("Thunder", the west and red), and the feminine [[Mokosh]] ("Wetness", the east and green) and Lada ("Beauty", the south and black). The four directions and colours also represent the four Slavic lands of original sacred topography.{{refn|group=note|The four faces of Svetovid, the four colours and four directions, also correspond to the four Russias of folk cosmology: [[White Ruthenia]], [[Red Ruthenia]], the [[Black Sea]] regions and [[Green Ukraine]]. See: ''Svetovid'' in the ''Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedic Dictionary'', 1987.}} They also represent the spinning of the four seasons.{{sfn|Leeming|2005|p=369: ''Svantovit''}}

Ultimately, Svetovid embodies in unity the supreme duality (Belobog and Chernobog) through which Rod manifests itself as Prav, and the axial interconnection of the three times with the four dimensions of present space. In other words, he represents Prav spiritualising Yav as Nav; or Svarog manifesting as spirit (Perun) in the material world governed by Veles. Dynda says that this conception reflects a common Indo-European spiritual vision of the cosmos, the same which was also elaborated in early and medieval Christianity as God who is at the same time creator (father), creature (son) and creating activity (spirit).{{sfn|Dynda|2014|p=76}}

===Prav, Yav and Nav—Heaven, Earth and humanity===
[[File:The Three Worlds (Heaven, Earth and humanity in-between) -- Maxim Sukharev.jpg|thumb|''The Three Worlds''—Maxim Sukharev, 2010s. Prav, Yav and Nav are represented, respectively, in the guise of Svarog ("Heaven") on the left, Mat Syra Zemlya ("Damp Mother Earth" who retains the squared rhythms of Heaven) on the right, and the "Son of Heaven" (Svarozhich), that is to say conscious humanity, as a medium in-between the two.]]

====Cosmology of the ''Book of Veles''====
{{Main|Prav-Yav-Nav}}
According to the ''Book of Veles'', reality has three dimensions, namely the aforementioned ''Prav'', ''Yav'' and ''Nav''.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2017|p=101}} Prav ("Right") itself is the level of the gods, who generate entities according to the supreme order of Rod; gods and the entities that they beget "make up" the great Rod. Yav ("actuality") is the level of matter and appearance, the here and now in which things appear in light, coalesce, but also dissolve in contingency; Nav ("probability") is the thin world of human ancestors, of spirit, consisting in the memory of the past and the projection of the future, that is to say the continuity of time.{{sfn|Rabotkina|2013|p=240}} Prav, the universal cosmic order otherwise described as the "Law of Heaven", permeates and regulates the other two hypostases.{{sfnm|1a1=Ivakhiv|1y=2005b|1p=202|2a1=Ivakhiv|2y=2005c|2p=230}}{{sfnm|1a1=Laruelle|1y=2008|1p=290|2a1=Aitamurto|2y=2016|2pp=66–67}}

====Lozko's genotheism and the worship of ancestors====
In her theological commentaries to the ''Book of Veles'', Ukrainian Rodnover leader [[Halyna Lozko]] betones the cosmological unity of the three planes of Heaven, Earth and humanity between them. She gives a definition of Rodnover theology and cosmology as "genotheism". God, hierarchically manifesting as different hypostases, a multiplicity of gods emerging from the all-pervading force Svarog, is genetically (''rodovid'') linked to humanity. On the human plane God is incarnated by the kin or lineage, in the Earth. Ethics and morality ultimately stem from this cosmology, as harmony with nature is possible only in the relationship between an ethnic group and its land.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=23}}

This is also the meaning of the worship of human ancestors, whether the Slavs' general forefather ''Or'' or ''Oryi'',{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=14, cites ''Or''}} or local forefathers such as ''Dingling'' worshipped by [[Vladivostok]] Rodnovers.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2007|p=54, cites ''Oryi'' and ''Dingling''}} Divine ancestors are the spirits who generate and hold together kins, they ''are'' the kins themselves. The Russian [[volkhv]] Dobroslav emphasises the importance of blood heritage, since, according to him, the violation of kinship purity brings about the loss of the relationship with the kin's divine ancestor.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2007|p=54–55}} Ukrainian Rodnover and scholar Yuri Shylov has developed a theory of God as a spiral "information field" that expresses itself in self-conscious humanity, which comes to full manifestation in the [[Proto-Indo-European|Indo-European]] "Saviour" archetype.{{sfn|Ivakhiv|2005a|p=23}}

P. Wadia]], an Indian theosophist on tour to European countries,&lt;ref name="Teosofiskakompaniet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.teosofiskakompaniet.net/BPWadiaBiografi.htm | title=Teosofiskakompaniet | publisher=Teosofiskakompaniet | date=2015 | accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was influenced by his philosophy and married him in 1928. The next year, she went to India with her spouse and got involved in his activities.&lt;ref name="Indian English and the Fiction of National Literature" /&gt; The Wadias founded several branches of the [[United Lodge of Theosophists]] in various places in Europe&lt;ref name="Indian English and the Fiction of National Literature" /&gt; and founded the first Indian branch in Mumbai in 1929.&lt;ref name="Teosofiskakompaniet" /&gt;

The subjectile is a kind of ground used in artistic painting.  The word has also been used by [[Antonin Artaud]] and [[Jacques Derrida]] commented its use.&lt;ref name="Art of A"&gt;Derrida J., and  Thévenin, P., ''The Secret Art of Antonin Artaud'', Caws, Mary Ann, The MIT Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  The subjectile is seen as a theory, not a fact; as a theory the subjectile is a tool that can be employed to analyse art objects to generate hypotheses concerning the relationship between subject and object in art.

Derrida mentions that the word 'subjectile' appears in an essay&lt;ref&gt; ''L’amour de L’art'' 2, no.8, Aout 1921&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Pierre Bonnard]], published in 1921.  The subjectile refers to Bonnard’s use of cardboard for painting.
The [http://www.collinslanguage.com/bilingual-dictionaries/french Concise French dictionary] translates 'subjectile' as 'Art: support (beneath paint, etc.)'. Without a support and ground the subject of a painting could not exist as it would fall away. Derrida argues that Artaud's subjectile is both ground and a support. It is stretched out, extended, beyond, through and behind the subject, it is not alien to the subject, yet ‘It has two situations’. Derrida holds that the subjectile functions as a hypothesis, and is a subjectile itself. ‘Subjectile, the word or the thing, can take the place of the subject or of the object – being neither one nor the other.’&lt;ref name="Art of A"/&gt;

[[Antonin Artaud]] mentions the subjectile three times in his writing.[[Jacques Derrida]], in his essay, ''To Unsense the Subjectile''  states ‘All three times, he is speaking of his own drawings, in 1932, 1946, and 1947’.&lt;ref name="Art of A"/&gt; The first time Artaud used the word was in a letter to André Rolland de Renéville, ‘Herewith a bad drawing in which what is called the subjectile betrayed me.’&lt;ref&gt;See: The original text, published in French, Artaud, Antonin, ''Oeuvres Completes'', [http://www.gallimard.fr/catalog/html/actu/index/index_artaud.html Gallimard] 1964 volume V, pp. 119 - 121.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1946, ‘This drawing is grave attempt to give life and existence to what until today had never been accepted in art, the botching of the subjectile, the piteous awkwardness of forms crumbling around an idea after having for so many eternities labored to join it. The page is soiled and spoiled, the paper crumpled, the people drawn with the consciousness of a child.’&lt;ref&gt;See: The original text, published in French, Artaud, Antonin, ''Oeuvres Completes'', Gallimard 1984 volume XIX, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally in February 1947, ‘The figures on the inert page said nothing under my hand. They offered themselves to me like millstones which would not inspire the drawing, and which I could cut. Scrap, file, sew, unsew, slash, and stitch without the subjectile ever complaining through father or through mother.’&lt;ref&gt;See: Paule Thevenin records the source as ‘Text of February 1947, written by Artaud at Ville-Évrard. Thevenin, Paule, Derrida, Jacques, ''Antonin Artaud, Dessins et Portraits'' Gallimard, 1986. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Derrida's essay was first published in French titled ''Forcener le Subjectile'' in 1986 by Gallimard and an abridged  English translation &lt;ref&gt; Jacques Derrida and Mary Ann Caws, ''Maddening the Subjectile'', Yale French Studies, No. 84, Boundaries: Writing &amp; Drawing (1994), pp. 154-171 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2930185 Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt; was  published later (in 1998 by MIT press). For copyright reasons the images published in the Gallimard book were excluded from the later English translation, which contains instead photographs of Artaud taken by Georges Pastier in 1947, the year before Artaud died.&lt;ref name="Art of A"/&gt;

The subjectile is also commented on by [[Susan Sontag]] in her introduction to the edited translation of Artaud's works.&lt;ref&gt;Artaud, A. 1988 [http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520064430 Selected Writings], (ed.) Susan Sontag, Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and further in ''The Antonin Artaud Critical Reader'', which includes texts by [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Susan Sontag]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheer, E. (ed.) 2004 [http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415282550/ Antonin Artaud: A Critical Reader]. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Aryan Path'' was founded in  January 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Aryan Path Paved the way for ‘The International PEN’ in India: A history|url=http://penwestbengal.blogspot.com.tr/2008/09/in-search-of-history-all-indian-pen.html|accessdate=28 October 2016|work=PEN West Bengal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first edition, a writer named "Shravaka" emphasised that &lt;blockquote&gt;so much "original" writing is done today, so much "self-expression" is indulged in that, in the glamour that is raised, the chants of the Gods remain unheard. One of our tasks is to bring home the truth that it is not derogatory to respect the old age facts of the science of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teosofiskakompaniet.net/BPWadiaBiografi.htm Bomanji Pestonji Wadia (1881 - 1958)] Biography of B.P.

Black American scholars such as [[Alain LeRoy Locke|Alain Locke]] and William Harrison also contributed to this journal.&lt;ref name="Plummer1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brenda Gayle Plummer|title=Rising wind: Black Americans and U.S. foreign affairs, 1935-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4eEkAbYTTUC&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=30 March 2012|date=24 June 1996|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-4575-2|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine ran several articles criticising [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;''"Several articles have appeared in the Aryan Path recently, deploring the effects of race prejudice in America, Africa and India''. "Theosophists find followers among N.Y. Intelligentsia". ''[[Baltimore Afro-American|The Afro American]]'', 6 October 1934, (p. 12).&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1933 the magazine received considerable correspondence concerning the rise of [[Nazism]], which the journal strongly opposed. In 1938 ''The Aryan Path'' ran an article condemning fascism and Nazism by [[G. D. H. Cole]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuruvila Pandikattu, ''Gandhi: The Meaning of Mahatma for the Millennium''. CRVP, 2001 {{ISBN|1565181565}}  (p. 249).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 ''The Aryan Path'' ran a series of articles on the [[Bon]] religion of Tibet by [[René de Nebesky-Wojkowitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Martin, ''Unearthing Bon Treasures: Life and Contested Legacy of a Tibetan Scripture Revealer, With a General Bibliography of Bon''. Brill, 2001 {{ISBN|9004121234}}, (pp. 390-391).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Outsider''''' is a non-fiction book by English writer [[Colin Wilson]], first published in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isbndb.com/d/book/the_outsider_a08.html|title=The Outsider|accessdate=22 March 2009|work=|publisher=J.P. Tarcher|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604132442/http://isbndb.com/d/book/the_outsider_a08.html|archivedate=4 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the works and lives of various artists – including [[H. G. Wells]] (''[[Mind at the End of Its Tether]]''), [[Franz Kafka]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Harley Granville-Barker]] (''The Secret Life''), [[Hermann Hesse]], [[T. E. Lawrence]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[William Blake]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and [[George Gurdjieff]] – Wilson explores the psyche of the Outsider, his effect on society, and society's effect on him.

On Christmas Day, 1954, alone in his room, Wilson sat down on his bed and began to write in his journal. He described his feelings as follows:

{{bquote |It struck me that I was in the position of so many of my favourite characters in fiction: Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov, Rilke's Malte Laurids Brigge, the young writer in Hamsun's ''Hunger'': alone in my room, feeling totally cut off from the rest of society. It was not a position I relished...Yet an inner compulsion had forced me into this position of isolation. I began writing about it in my journal, trying to pin it down. And then, quite suddenly, I saw that I had the makings of a book. I turned to the back of my journal and wrote at the head of the page: 'Notes for a book The Outsider in Literature'..."&lt;ref&gt; ''Introduction: ''The Outsider'', twenty years on''. Picador, 1978, p.9  {{ISBN|0-330-25391-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Outsider''  has been translated into over thirty languages (including Russian and Chinese) and never been out of print since publication day of Monday, 28 May 1956. Wilson wrote much of it in the Reading Room of the [[British Museum]], and during this period was, for a time, living in a sleeping bag on [[Hampstead Heath]]. He continued to work on it at a furious pace and:

{{bquote |One day I typed out the introduction, and a few pages from the middle, and sent them to [[Victor Gollancz]] with a letter giving a synopsis of the book. He replied within two days, saying he would be interested to see the book when completed ...}}

Gollancz was the head of publishers [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]].  Wilson  was inspired to send the book to him after he found a copy of the publisher's own book ''[[A Year of Grace]]'' in a second-hand bookshop, which led him to believe that he had found a sympathetic publisher.&lt;ref&gt;''The angry years: the rise and fall of the angry young men'' by Colin Wilson, pps. 15–16 Robson, 2007, {{ISBN|1-86105-972-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==

The book is structured in order to mirror the Outsider's experience: a sense of dislocation, or of being at odds with society. These are figures like Dostoyevsky's "Underground-Man" who seem to be lost to despair and non-transcendence with no way out.

Characters are then brought to the fore (including the title character from Hermann Hesse’s novel ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]''). These are presented as examples of those who have insightful moments of lucidity in which they feel as though things are worthwhile/meaningful amidst their shared, usual, experience of nihilism and gloom. Sartre's ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'' is herein the key text – and the moment when the hero listens to a song in a cafe which momentarily lifts his spirits is the outlook on life to be normalized. 

Wilson then engages in some detailed case studies of artists who failed in this task and tries to understand their weakness – which is either intellectual, of the body or of the emotions. The final chapter is Wilson's attempt at a "great synthesis" in which he justifies his belief that western philosophy is afflicted with a needless pessimistic fallacy.

== Commentary ==

The book has never been out of print since publication day in May 1956 and has been translated into at least 30 languages. Wilson helped to keep the work fresh by adding to it over the years: the 1967 paperback edition included a fifteen-page postscript; a ten-page essay 'The Outsider, twenty years on' was added to the 1978 edition; and in 2001 an index appeared for the first time alongside fifteen pages of postscripts originally written for a Chinese translation. It is still published with enthusiastic comments from the likes of [[Edith Sitwell]] and [[Cyril Connolly]] adorning its cover. This reception – of his first book at the age of 24 – was a high critical watermark for Wilson which he did not achieve again until the publication of ''The Occult'' in 1971 after which he enjoyed a long and fruitful career as a writer, philosopher, novelist, lecturer and broadcaster until his death in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Colin|title=Dreaming to Some Purpose|publisher=Arrow Books|year=2005|chapter=Backlash|isbn=0-09-947147-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sequels ==
Wilson followed ''The Outsider'' with six philosophical titles, which have become known as ''The Outsider Cycle'': ''Religion and the Rebel'' (1957), ''The Age of Defeat'' (''The Stature of Man'' in the U.S., 1959), ''The Strength to Dream'' (1962), ''Origins of the Sexual Impulse'' (1963), ''Beyond the Outsider'' (1965) and the summary volume ''Introduction to the New Existentialism'' (1966). These were accompanied by a string of novels aimed at putting his philosophical ideas into action.

'''''The Power of Half: One Family's Decision to Stop Taking and Start Giving Back''''' is a book written by Kevin Salwen and his teenage daughter Hannah in 2010.&lt;ref name="worldcat1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Ihsan|title=Paperback Row|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/books/review/PaperRow-t.html|accessdate=March 9, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosboch |first=Lili |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-06-21/family-sells-2-million-mansion-gives-half-to-charity-review.html |title=Family Sells $2M Mansion, Gives Half to Charity: Review |publisher=Bloomberg |date=June 21, 2010 |author= |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book describes how the Salwen family decided to sell their home so that they could donate half the proceeds to charity.&lt;ref name="oprah1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oprah.com/world/Hannah-and-Kevin-Salwens-New-Book-The-Power-of-Half |title= A Surprising Path to Philanthropy |work=O, The Oprah Magazine  |date=April 2010 |author=Rachel Mount |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It discusses the initial decision-making, the process of selling the home, making the donation, downgrading to a smaller home, and what they learned in the process.&lt;ref name="oprah1"/&gt; The book details the Salwens' process in choosing a charity partner that would fit their values and effect a lasting change, and how their actions supporting and empowering a village in Ghana differed from their original idea of "direct involvement".&lt;ref name=worldcat1 /&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book details why and how the Salwen family decided to sell their home in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/What-could-you-live-without/articleshow/5498358.cms |title=What Could You Live Without? |work=The Economic Times |date=January 25, 2010 |author= |accessdate=March 9, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127015718/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News-By-Industry/ET-Cetera/What-could-you-live-without/articleshow/5498358.cms |archivedate=January 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The home was a luxurious, 6,500-square-foot (600-square-meter), 1912 historic dream-house in [[Ansley Park]], in  [[Midtown Atlanta|midtown]] [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://moneywatch.bnet.com/saving-money/blog/ask-agent/atlanta-family-sells-house-donates-half-proceeds-to-charity/1496/ |title=Atlanta Family Sells House, Donates Half Proceeds to Charity |publisher=CBS MoneyWatch |date=February 15, 2010 |author=Allison Rogers |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It had [[Corinthian column]]s, five bedrooms, eight fireplaces, four ornate bathrooms, and a private elevator to Hannah's bedroom.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greenbuildingelements1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greenbuildingelements.com/2010/10/04/could-you-give-up-half-your-house/ |title=Could You Give Up Half Your House? |work=Green Building Elements |date=October 4, 2010 |author=Dawn Killough |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="heraldtribune1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20100710/ZNYT01/7103010/-1/sports?p=all&amp;tc=pgall |title=‘Daddy, Are We Rich?’ and Other Tough Questions |work=Herald Tribune |author=Ron Lieber |date=July 10, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="azcentral1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bland |first=Karina |url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/arizonaliving/articles/2010/03/21/20100321bland0321.html |title=Family lives on half the lifestyle, twice the joy |work=The Arizona Republic |date=March 21, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article7060900.ece |title= Daddy, I want to help the poor–let’s sell the house; A daughter’s plea led one family to make a big gesture, but not everyone is applauding |work=The Sunday Times |date=March 14, 2010|author= John-Paul Flintoff |accessdate=March 9, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family down-graded by replacing their home with a house that was half as expensive and less than half the size.&lt;ref name="heraldtribune1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/family-sells-15-million-home-half-price-village/story?id=9780698&amp;page=1 |title=Family Sells $1.5 Million Home For One That's Half the Price to Help Village in Ghana |publisher=ABC News |date=February 8, 2010 |author= |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Salwens donated half the proceeds ($850,000) of the sale of their original home to [[The Hunger Project]], a charity that works to lessen the hunger of 30,000 rural villagers in over 30 villages in Ghana, and helps them gain self-reliance.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;

The book describes the consensus-driven process that the parents and their two children used–over a period of time–to reach the decision to give away half the value of their home, and how they chose the charity from a number of [[non-profit organization]]s that they considered.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azcentral1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cantonrep1"/&gt;  It describes the challenges that the family faced while turning their family project into a reality, from economic ones to keeping the project a secret for a period of time so that they would not appear to be "freaks" to their friends.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newyorker1"&gt;{{cite journal|author= [[Larissa MacFarquhar]] |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2010/03/15/100315ta_talk_macfarquhar |title=A family makes a big donation to a village in Ghana |work=The New Yorker |date=January 7, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before they embarked on the project, the family members had little contact with one another, other than at meals.&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;  Hannah notes that ''The Power of Half''  "is a relationships book, not really a giving book."  She feels that the project helped her family grow closer to one another.&lt;ref name="naturalhomemagazine1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kellner |first=Jessica |url=http://www.naturalhomemagazine.com/green-professionals/the-power-of-half-natural-home-interviews-hannah-salwen.aspx |title=The Power of Half: Natural Home Interviews Hannah Salwen |work=Natural Home Magazine |date=September–October 2010  |accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' notes how the family "became happier with less—and urges others to do likewise."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

"We know that selling a house is goofy, and we recognize that most people can't do it", admitted Kevin Salwen.&lt;ref name="azcentral1"/&gt; "We never encourage anybody to sell their house. That was just the thing that we had more than enough of. For others it may be time, or lattes, or iTunes downloads, or clothes in their closet. But everyone has more than enough of something.”&lt;ref name="heraldtribune1"/&gt;  He clarified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We want our kids to be idealistic, but we also say, ‘Let’s not go too nuts here'.  We’re not Mother Teresa. We’re not taking a vow of poverty, or giving away half of everything we own. We gave away half of one thing, which happened to be our house. Everybody can give away half of one thing, and put it to use. You’ll do a little bit of good for the world–and amazing things for your relationships.&lt;ref name="azcentral1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Popular reception==
[[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]] praised Hannah and the Salwens for the project, remarking: “We often say that young people must not let themselves be infected by the cynicism of their elders. Hannah inoculated her family with the vision to dream a different world, and the courage to help create it.”&lt;ref name="greenbuildingelements1"/&gt;

Skeptics criticized them for "self-promotion" or for the amount of money they donated to charity. Some critics questioned their choice of charity—finding fault with the family for having donated their money to help needy people in Africa rather than in the United States.&lt;ref name="newyorker1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=cour&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/family/articles/2010/07/31/are_they_courageous_or_reckless/?page=full |title=Are they courageous or reckless? |work=The Boston Globe |author=Joseph P.

Commented one viewer of a television interview: “What kind of ass clown works his tail off, and busts his hump getting a decent education, only to listen to his kid suggest they give away the house?”&lt;ref name="newyorker1"/&gt;

As Kevin Salwen noted: "Most people are supportive. And a few are very uncomfortable."&lt;ref name="newyorker1"/&gt;  Asked facetiously whether Hannah, then still in high school, had "concocted the world's greatest college-admissions ploy", Kevin laughed and replied: "No.  Anyway, wouldn’t it be the world’s most expensive?"&lt;ref name="boston1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/02/13/one_familys_commitment_to_helping_others/ |title=One family’s commitment to helping others |work=The Boston Globe |date=February 13, 2010 |author=Joseph P.

Reviewing it for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Lisa Bonos wrote that the book, "soaring in idealism, and yet grounded in realism, can show Americans of any means how best to give back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/16/AR2010041602032.html |title=Book review: 'The Power of Half,' by Kevin Salwen and Hannah Salwen |work=The Washington Post|author=Lisa Bonos |date= April 18, 2010|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas D. Kristof]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', said he found the project "crazy, impetuous, and utterly inspiring", and that "It’s a book that, frankly, I’d be nervous about leaving around where my own teenage kids might find it. An impressionable child reads this, and the next thing you know your whole family is out on the street."&lt;ref name=nyt2&gt;{{cite news|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|title=What Could You Live Without?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/24/opinion/24kristof.html|accessdate=March 9, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Susan Salter Reynolds wrote:  "You feel lighter reading this book, as if the heavy weight of house and car and appliances, the need to collect these things to feel safe as a family, are lifted and replaced by something that makes much more sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/24/entertainment/la-ca-discoveries24-2010jan24 |title='The Power of Half' by Kevin and Hannah Salwen |publisher=Los Angeles Times |author=Susan Salter Reynolds |date=January 24, 2010 |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lili Rosboch wrote for [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] that it "is an inspiring book about the decision to trade objects for togetherness and the chance to help others."&lt;ref name="bloomberg1"/&gt;  Writing in ''[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]]'', Jen Harper said that while she was somewhat skeptical before she started the book, the "compelling and well-written narrative left me both impressed and inspired," and that she found the book "endearing, funny, and uplifting".&lt;ref name="grist1"/&gt;  Courtney E. Martin wrote in ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' that the book "is highly accessible, sure to be devoured by Oprah devotees and disaffected finance guys hoping for a jolt of optimism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-02-20/selling-the-housefor-charity/ |title=Selling Your House For Charity |work=The Daily Beast |date=February 20, 2010 |author= Courtney E. Martin|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill Williams of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' called it "spirited".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/02/15/the_power_of_half_is_full_of_inspiration/|title=‘The Power of Half’ is full of inspiration |publisher=The Boston Globe |author=Bill Williams |date=February 15, 2010 |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also writing for ''The Boston Globe'', Joseph P. Kahn said "they’re my new role models" – after admitting: "I confess to being fixated on the opposite life formula. Call it the Power of Twice. As in, twice the leisure time, twice the income, twice the sleep. A man can dream, can’t he?"&lt;ref name="boston1"/&gt;

==Subsequent projects==
The project inspired others to commit to donating half their money, or half of a possession or income, to charity.&lt;ref name="timesonline1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grist1"/&gt;  In an interview in ''[[Natural Home Magazine]]'', Hannah noted that “A number of my friends at Atlanta Girls School have started their own Half projects, including a couple who are donating half of their babysitting money to environmental causes. That’s pretty flattering."&lt;ref name="greenbuildingelements1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="naturalhomemagazine1"/&gt;

Rev. Tess Baumberger, the Minister at [[Unity Church]] of [[North Easton]], Massachusetts, read the book and announced that in December 2010 the Church would give away half of its Sunday collections to a local charity.&lt;ref name="cantonrep1"/&gt; Baumberger remarked: "What will we learn by practicing the power of half? What will this program teach our children and youth? I cannot wait to find out."&lt;ref name="cantonrep1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Rev.

'''''The Principle of Hope''''' ({{lang-de|Das Prinzip Hoffnung}}) is a book by the Marxist philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]], published in three volumes in 1954, 1955, and 1959, in which the author explores utopianism, studying the utopian impulses present in art, literature, religion and other forms of cultural expression, and envisages a future state of absolute perfection. ''The Principle of Hope'' has become fundamental to dialogue between Christians and Marxists.&lt;ref name="Corrington"&gt;{{cite book |author=Corrington, Robert S. |title=The Community of Interpreters: On the Hermeneutics of Nature and the Bible in the American Philosophical Tradition |year=1987 |publisher=Mercer University Press |page=103 |isbn=0-86554-284-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
Originally written between 1938 and 1947 in the United States,&lt;ref name="Corrington" /&gt; an enlarged and revised version of ''The Principle of Hope'' was published successively in three volumes in 1954, 1955, and 1959. Bloch, who had emigrated to the United States in 1938, returned to Europe in 1949 and became a Professor of Philosophy in [[East Germany]]. Despite having initially supported the regime, Bloch came under attack for his philosophical unorthodoxy and support for greater cultural freedom in East Germany, and publication of ''The Principle of Hope'' was delayed for political reasons.&lt;ref name="Kołakowski"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kołakowski, Leszek |title=Main Currents of Marxism Volume 3: The Breakdown |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1985 |pages=425–439 |isbn=0-19-285109-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The philosopher [[Leszek Kołakowski]] calls ''The Principle of Hope'' Bloch's ''magnum opus'', writing that it contains all his important ideas.&lt;ref name="Kołakowski" /&gt; The work has been described as "monumental" by the philosopher [[Robert S.

'''''The Secret of the Golden Flower''''' ({{zh|c=太乙金華宗旨|p=Tàiyǐ Jīnhuá Zōngzhǐ}}) is a Chinese [[Taoist]] classic about [[neidan]] (inner alchemy) [[meditation]].

== History ==

The text of ''The Secret of the Golden Flower'' is attributed to [[Lü Dongbin]] of the late [[Tang dynasty]]. It is now known to have originated hundreds of years later, and was first published in the early [[Qing dynasty]] (清代前期), circa 1668–1692.

== Methods ==
[[Image:Stage1.gif|thumb|First stage of meditation]]
[[Image:The Immortal Soul of the Taoist Adept.PNG|thumb|Second stage of meditation]]

Despite the varieties of impressions, interpretation and opinion expressed by translators, the [[meditation]] technique described by ''The Secret of the Golden Flower'' is a straightforward, silent method; the book's description of meditation has been characterized as "[[Zen]] with details". The meditation technique, set forth in poetic language, reduces to a formula of sitting, breathing, and contemplating.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Sitting primarily relates to a straight posture. Breathing is described in detail, primarily in terms of the esoteric physiology of the path of ''[[qi]]'' (also known as ''chi'' or ''ki''), or breath energy. The energy path associated with breathing has been described as similar to an internal wheel vertically aligned with the spine. When breathing is steady, the wheel turns forward, with breath energy rising in back and descending in front.&lt;ref&gt;"The rotation method makes use of breathing to blow on the fire of the gates of life... The way leads from the sacrum upward in a backward flowing way to the summit of the Creative, and on through the house of the Creative; then it sinks through the two stories in a direct downward-flowing way into the solar plexus, and warms it."  Page 61, 1962 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bad breathing habits (or bad posture, or even bad thoughts) may cause the wheel not to turn, or move backward, inhibiting the circulation of essential breath energy. In contemplation, one watches thoughts as they arise and recede.&lt;ref&gt;"Only one must not stay sitting rigidly if worldly thoughts come up, but must examine where the thought is, where it began, and where it fades out."  Page 36, 1962 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

The meditation technique is supplemented by descriptions of affirmations of progress in the course of a daily practice, suggesting stages that could be reached and phenomenon that may be observed such as a feeling of lightness, like floating upward or slight levitation. Such benefits are ascribed to improved internal energy associated with breath energy circulation, improvements that alleviate previously existing impediments. Several drawings portray imagery relevant to the personal evolution of a meditation practitioner, images that may be somewhat confusing in terms of pure rational analysis.  "Only after one hundred days of consistent work, only then is the light genuine; only then can one begin to work with the spirit-fire."&lt;ref&gt;Page 39, 1962 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such illustration represents the first one hundred days, or "gathering the light". The second one represents an emergence of meditative consciousness. The third stage represents a meditative awareness that exists even in mundane, daily life. Stage four represents a higher meditative perception, where all conditions are recognized. Then, varied conditions are portrayed as separately perceived, yet each separate perception is part of a whole of awareness.

== Translations ==

''The Secret of the Golden Flower'' was first translated into German by sinologist [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]], a friend of [[Carl Jung]], who had been introduced to the work by his Chinese teacher.&lt;ref&gt;In Carl Jung's autobiography (''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', pp. 373–377), he wrote a section about his friend Wilhelm and said, in relevant part, "In China he had the good fortune to meet a sage of the old school whom the revolution had driven out of the interior. This sage, Lau Nai Suan, introduced him to Chinese yoga philosophy and the psychology of the [[I Ching]]. To the collaboration of these two men we owe the edition of the I Ching with its excellent commentary."  Presumably, the same is true of the yoga philosophy of ''The Secret of the Golden Flower''.  Although Wilhelm's original German edition first appeared in the autumn of 1929, just months before he died (according to the Preface by Baynes), Jung indicates in his Foreword to ''The Secret of the Golden Flower'' that Wilhelm had sent him the text earlier, and also indicates that it was on Jung's initiative that the book was published.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was later translated from German to English by Cary F. Baynes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoolofwisdom.com/history/teachers/richard-wilhelm/carl-jung-on-richar-wilhelm/ Carl Jung on Richard Wilhelm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419011711/http://www.schoolofwisdom.com/history/teachers/richard-wilhelm/carl-jung-on-richar-wilhelm/ |date=2015-04-19 }} Retrieved August 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Jung provides comments for both of Wilhelm's major Chinese translations, including (in 1949) the  nineteen-page (pp. xxi–xxxix) foreword to the Wilhelm/Baynes translation of the ''[[I Ching]]'', discussing the transpersonal aspect, and ''The commentary on The secret of the golden flower'' (1929).

In 1991, the text was translated afresh from the Chinese original by [[Thomas Cleary]], a scholar of Eastern studies, who criticized the validity of Wilhelm's translation, characterizing it as incomplete and inaccurate:&lt;ref&gt;Cleary, Thomas. ''The Secret of the Golden Flower''. 1993. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Because the still-current Wilhelm/Jung/Baynes edition of this manual contains dangerous and misleading contaminations, a primary consideration was to make the contents of ''The Secret of the Golden Flower'' explicitly accessible to both lay and specialist audiences.}}

Cleary gives some examples of the way that the text was commonly misinterpreted by Wilhelm and Jung, and describes such an instance in the very beginning of the text:&lt;ref&gt;Cleary, Thomas. ''The Secret of the Golden Flower''. 1993. p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the first section of this text, for example, Wilhelm translates ''zhixu zhiling zhi shen'', which means a spirit (i.e. mind) that is completely open and completely effective, as "God of Utmost Emptiness and Life." Based on this sort of translation, Jung thought that the Chinese had no idea that they were discussing psychological phenomena. He then tried to repsychologize the terminology, but since he did not quite understand it to begin with he could not but wind up with a distortion in the end.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8829">'''Tony Duvert''' (July 2, 1945 &amp;ndash; August 2008) was a French writer and philosopher. In the 1970s he achieved some renown, winning the [[Prix Medicis]] in 1973 for his novel ''[[Paysage de Fantaisie]]''. Duvert's writings are notable both for their style and core themes: the celebration and defence of pedophilia, and criticism of modern child-rearing. In the 1970s attitudes to sexual liberation and child sexuality allowed Duvert to express himself publicly.  However, when attitudes altered markedly in the 1980s, he was left feeling frustrated and oppressed.

==Youth and early writings==
Tony Duvert was born on 2 July 1945 in [[Villeneuve-le-Roi]], [[Val-de-Marne]]. As a child he was shy and withdrawn, but was later to write that his sex life began when he was eight.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Duvert, ''L'Enfant au masculin'', éditions de Minuit, 1980, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; Expelled from school at twelve for homosexuality, he was sent by his parents to a psychiatrist for treatment: the methods used he described as brutal and humiliating.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Duvert, ''L'Enfant au masculin, éditions de Minuit'', 1980, pages 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; He ran away from home and attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Sebhan, ''Tony Duvert l'enfant silencieux'', Denoël, 2010, p. 29-31 and 109&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Duvert joined the high school Jean-Baptiste Corot in Savigny-sur-Orge, where he was a brilliant student, but with few friends. After high school he moved to Paris to begin an arts degree but preferred to devote himself to writing.

Duvert made his literary debut in 1967 with ''Récidive'', published by Jerome Lindon of Editions de Minuit, who recognised his potential. However the novel's subject matter made the publisher nervous, and the book was printed in a limited edition of 712 copies available only through subscription and selected bookstores.

Highly productive, Duvert soon produced three successive novels: ''Interdit de séjour'' and ''Portrait d'homme-couteau'' in 1969, and ''Le Voyageur'' in 1970, which were also sold by subscription. As well as their political aspect in promoting sexual relations between adults and children, and criticising of bourgeois society, these first four novels featured narrative and stylistic experimentation in the form of rambling style, typographic games, the absence or multiplicity of plots, jumbled chronology or facts, and lack of punctuation.

==Critical recognition==
Thanks to [[Roland Barthes]], Duvert achieved public recognition in 1973 with his novel ''Paysage de fantaisie'' (''Strange Landscape''), which won the [[Prix Medicis]], and which was greeted warmly by critics. For [[Claude Mauriac]] the book revealed "gifts and art that the word talent is not enough to express"&lt;ref&gt;Claude Mauriac, « Une littérature corrosive », Le Figaro littéraire n°1396, 17 February 1973, II, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Duvert expounded his ideology at length in ''Le Bon Sexe Illustré'' (''Good Sex Illustrated'') in which he sharply criticised sex education and the modern western family. Critics praised its humor and his ability to observe the false pretenses of bourgeois society.

With his literary prize money Duvert moved to Morocco, an experience which resulted in his next novel ''Journal D’un Innocent'', (''Journal of an Innocent'') published in 1976. Disillusioned by its society, he moved to Thore la Rochette, before settling in Tours. His next novel ''Quand Mourut Jonathan'' (''When Jonathan Died''), published in 1978, was inspired by an earlier vacation with a neglected boy.

Despite his productivity and critical success, Duvert had not achieved the public success he hoped for. To reach a wider audience and raise awareness of his ideas, he decided to write a novel that would incorporate his favorite themes while being less sexually explicit and written in a classic form. The result was ''L'Île Atlantique'' (1979, published in English as ''Atlantic Island'' in 2017), which received critical raves, and sold somewhat better than his previous works.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Sebhan, ''Tony Duvert l'enfant silencieux'', Denoël, 2010, pp.102-103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lack of exposure to English audiences==
Apart from ''Good Sex Illustrated'', ''Diary of an Innocent'', and ''Atlantic Island'', all published by Semiotext(e)/MIT Press, English translations of Duvert's novels and other books are out of print and difficult to find.

==Withdrawal from the world and death==
In the 1980s, Duvert published ''L’enfant au masculin'' (1980), in which he further expounded his sexual philosophy; a novel ''Un Anneau d’Argent à l’Oreille''; and a book of aphorisms ''Abécédaire Malveillant'': unlike his earlier writings, their critical reception was mostly indifferent or poor.  By the late 1980s, Duvert was unable to pay the rent on his apartment. With the social mood towards pedophilia hardening in the wake of several abuse scandals, he felt the world had turned against him. He withdrew to his mother's house in Loir-et-Cher, and became a total recluse. Duvert published nothing further, and was largely forgotten. However, in 2005, his novel ''L'Île Atlantique'', which had first appeared in 1979, was adapted for television by [[Gerard Mordillat]].

Tony Duvert's body was discovered at his home in August 2008, several weeks after his death, in a state of decomposition. His death briefly raised his media profile in France again; obituaries noting the quality of his writing, but also reflecting upon the change in official attitudes to child sexuality.

[[Gilles Sebhan]] has published two French-language biographical works on Duvert, ''Tony Duvert: L'Enfant Silencieux'' (Éditions Denoël 2010) and ''Retour à Duvert'' (le dilettante 2015). To date, neither book has been translated into English.

At the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] he retired to [[Rotterdam]] where he was for some years preacher at the [[Walloons|Walloon]] church; in 1695 the elector of [[Brandenburg]] appointed him pastor and professor of philosophy, and later inspector of the French college at [[Berlin]], where he enjoyed considerable reputation as a representative of [[René Descartes|Cartesianism]] and as a student of [[physics]]. His principal work is a laborious ''Lexicon Rationale, sive Thesaurus Philosophicus'' (Rotterdam, 1692; new and enlarged edition, Leeuwarden, 1713). He also wrote ''Theses de Cognitione Dei'' (1662), and started the ''Nouveau Journal des Savants'' (1694–1698).
